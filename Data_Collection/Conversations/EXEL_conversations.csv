"As usual Rob barfs all over the board once again. Those insider trades you so expertly spotted were 10b5-1 trades set up half a year ago for options that were awarded some 6 years ago. Besides your commitment to being a low life, have you ever held on to anything for 6 years?"
"Ipsen results -Q2 Transcripthttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4443930-ipsen-s-ipsey-ceo-francesco-caio-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript David Loew Ipsen CEOCabometyx in monotherapy delivered strong volume growth mainly in second-line renal cell carcinoma across most geographies. We are pleased with the recent launch of the combination with nivolumab in Germany and we look forward to further launches in due course. In oncology, we were pleased to opt-in with Exelixis in differentiated thyroid cancer, a small financial opportunity but a big potential step for patients. In the total, we continue to invest to support the growth of the business. Further investments were made in the launch of Cabometyx combination in first-line renal cell Ayaz Ebrahim Yeah, Ayaz Ebrahim, JP Morgan. Hello, Ayaz Ebrahim, JP Morgan. Just two questions for me to. The question is on Cabometyx. Just following the disappointing ATC data, just wondering how you see the past to peak sales of #$%$700 million. I mean if you can give us an update on expectations for non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer, in terms of your confidence in those indications and the timing of any data laid-out? And my second question is on the BKX-001 just if you could talk us through the [indiscernible] process behind in licensing that asset in terms of what you've seen in the profile that differentiates it from lung cancer? David Loew Thanks a lot Ebrahim. Great questions. Hepatocellular is not going to influence the guidance that we have given with the above #$%$700 million peak sales. Reason is, you remember that we stated before that we don't have a patents on [indiscernible] in China that we were looking in -- okay, what is achievable there, of course, you don't have hepatocellular as a very high incidence in China. And so, therefore, in our forecast model, HCC was actually not having a very large weight in addition, that is quite an ironic effect. Of course, if you do not bring a new indication your price is going to stay where it is with the renal cell indication. So, short-term, it will be actually slightly accretive. Of course, longer term, we will lose a little bit of sales, but it was not so meaningful that, we have to change the guidance. So we're going to stick to our guidance there. In terms of non-small cell lung cancer and castrate resistant prostate cancer, you remember that we have had good Phase Ib results and so we are believing that this is a good combination and we expect to filing still 2023. Unidentified Analyst And then secondly, on Cabometyx the Q2 was flat versus Q1 and how do you [indiscernible] could help us understand how the launch in first-line is progressing? And as we're seeing new patient flow there and any feedback you're receiving from the physicians? David Loew Then for Cabometyx, in terms of patient flow and market shares and volumes. So you have seen that our sales kept on increasing. And we see good gains in volumes. Second-line and we see also the first-line launch in Germany starting to pick up. It's a bit early in terms of market research data, you know we have -- very recently launched. So we need a little bit more distance, but the feedback from the [indiscernible] is very positive. They see that Cabo vivo it?s bringing a very good balance of very high efficacy and good safety combined with an excellent quality of life. So I think it's a very competitive regimen. Thank you"

"I saw on IV message board they are back to counting scripts . As we predicted , that’s all there is left. I can see MMM sitting in the basement of Exelixis HQs doing the same . Or maybe he doesn’t care anymore ?"
Rally is officially over. Short lived as it was.
"Sold my shares and shorted when it was around $24, then buy back around $21, it's been range bound like that for years, this is how you can profits from this, trade it not hold it forever. And then all of a sudden it dropped to $18 like a gift/bonus falls from the sky. Have not recover my short positions yet, since I have some rooms to play with, I think it's on the way to $17, I can wait a little longer."
"This is a company spending big time on R&D right now. $600M a year. I don't want to be too repetitive but if you do not believe in the science, the pipeline. If you do not believe in the people making these judgements primarily MMM Gisela Schwab and Peter Lamb. You should not own the stock. I'm betting the R&D pays off in the long run."

"Hey ""Expert"", where are you hiding? We know you hate EXEL as an investment, but I asked you to tell us what you DO like. Why do you refuse to tell us in your ""expert"" opinion what stocks you do like? I will go first. I really like ENTA and TRIL as high risk high reward stocks. Well, ENTA is less of a risk as it has a nice revenue stream coming from its HepC partnership with ABBV. I think both could be 10 baggers. Don't punk out and say a giant like ABBV, which I have owned for some time and love because of its 5% dividend. I am talking somewhat longer term risks. Your move."
the good/the bad news. I treat exel like MMM a milking cow. I can buy sub 17/16 and feel safe with my investment due to their cash levels. NOW when the price starts going near 20+ we sell the calls. If we get bought out...oh well. if not keep collecting that premium. Its a very good stock to run this strategy.

"Exelixis Announces Partner Takeda and Ono Receive Approval in Japan for CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) in Combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab) for the Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.ALAMEDA, Calif., August 25, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), its partner responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) in Japan, and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ono) received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to manufacture and market CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab) as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).""We’re excited our partner Takeda, along with Ono, will be able to bring CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO to patients with advanced kidney cancer in Japan following regulatory approvals as a first-line treatment in the U.S. and EU earlier this year,"" said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., Exelixis’ President and Chief Executive Officer. ""With approximately 25,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed in Japan annually, we’re pleased that this important new treatment option will now be available to Japanese patients in need of new therapies.""The approval is based on CheckMate -9ER, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic RCC compared with sunitinib. In CheckMate -9ER, CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) and doubled median progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib, with a favorable safety profile.Per the terms of Exelixis and Takeda’s collaboration and license agreement, Exelixis is eligible to receive a milestone payment of $20 million from Takeda upon the first commercial sale of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO for the treatment of RCC. Exelixis continues to be eligible to receive additional development, regulatory and first-sale milestones for potential future cabozantinib indications and is also eligible for sales revenue milestones and royalties on net sales of cabozantinib in Japan.Takeda previously received approvals to manufacture and market CABOMETYX in Japan as a treatment for patients with curatively unresectable or metastatic RCC and for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has progressed after prior systemic therapy.About CheckMate -9ERCheckMate -9ER is an open-label, randomized (1:1), multi-national phase 3 trial evaluating patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component. A total of 651 patients (22% favorable risk, 58% intermediate risk, 20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to CABOMETYX at a dose of 40 mg once-daily and OPDIVO (n = 323) versus sunitinib (n = 328). The primary endpoint is PFS; secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. The primary efficacy analysis compares the doublet combination regimen of CABOMETYX and OPDIVO versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co. and co-funded by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.About RCCThe American Cancer Society’s 2021 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S.1 Clear cell RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults.2 If detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate for RCC is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC, however, the five-year survival rate is only 13%.1 Approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and 71,000 worldwide will require systemic treatment for advanced kidney cancer in 2021.3About 70% of RCC cases are known as ""clear cell"" carcinomas, based on histology.4 The majority of clear cell RCC tumors have below-normal levels of a protein called von Hippel-Lindau, which leads to higher levels of MET, AXL and VEGF.5,6 These proteins promote tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel growth), growth, invasiveness and metastasis.7,8,9,10 MET and AXL may provide escape pathways that drive resistance to VEGF receptor inhibitors.6,7About CABOMETYX (cabozantinib)In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC; for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib; and for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with OPDIVO. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical develop"
"If you haven't been paying attention, EXEL is going to have strong Q2 growth when earnings come out end of July. Do your own DD, but the current PPS is trading at an extreme discount when considering the revenue trajectory that started with 9ER approval at the end of January. Ignore the noise from the analysts around Cosmic 312. The CEO, MMM, took a bullet early by making a negative statement regarding the OS data. OS was very likely confounded by new therapies, PFS, ORR, and DOR will be/are strong. No confounding possible in these data. In retrospect, may have created an unusual buying opportunity in light of the double digit growth that began in Q1 and should continue into future quarters. Keep in mind, the time on therapy with the Nivo/Cabo doublet is nearly double that of Cabo mono therapy. This alone will create a compounding effect in growth in the near term."
"This stock dropped like a rock when one of their pipeline drugs had a disappointing result, but what would you rather have... an approved blockbuster drug making you billions, or good results on an unapproved drug with questionable marketability? The price drop was unwarranted and actual financial results warrants a significant price increase!"
This stock goes down with good news and down with bad news. Head scatcher.
"Totally agree with JT . I still think in the perspective of 1-2 years EXEL is significantly overvalued . Cabo is essentially 2nd like RCC drug , 1st line RCC is going to be 10% of the market at best , other cancer indications are out of the picture now . In the next 1-2 years there is huge competitive threat in the 2nd line RCC space like lenvatinib + belzutifan ( HIF -2 alpha inhibitor) that is tested against cabozantinib in a pivotal phase 3 study . If that reads positive Cabo is relegated to 3rd and 4th line where tivozanib Is approved and is much better tolerated . So it’s likely that in 2 years cabozantinib ( and Exelixis) will be a 4th and 5th line RCC player worth about 3-4 $ /share . So IMHO we will soon be looking at July 2021 as “ good old days “. Not the most optimistic opinion but and expert opinion"

smooth sailing

covered call sellers dream lol. Just build a position and sell calls collecting the premium. The risk is a buyout around 30 but we've been saying that for years
A historic day for exel so far down only 10 cents. Whoppe.
Time for PFE to go shopping!
The interesting anecdote about 1st line cabozantinib / nivolumab in 1st line RCC - my acquaintance is an oncologist in big -university affiliated group and is using competing combination ( pembrolizumab /axitinib) He has never seen Exelixis sales force come by and make any effort to present the data and at least try to convince him to consider it . Nobody really is using it except few paid Exelixis doctors and I think they already gave up on it .

Thank you, Susan, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Exelixis’ had a strong second quarter across all segments of our business, as we grew the CABOMETYX franchise and advance our pipeline of promising early-stage programs.The company posted record cabozantinib franchise net product revenue and total revenue in Q2, based on strong demand for the CABOMETYX nivolumab combination across all segments of the first-line RCC market.Syndicated market research highlights that the cabo/nivo doublet plays a leading role in first-line RCC and reflects the strength of the efficacy, tolerability and quality of life data from the CheckMate 9ER trial.We maintained significant momentum with a 59% year-over-year growth in Cabo net product revenue in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Our goal remains to exit 2022 with a $1.5 billion annualized run rate for RCC in the US.Exelixis also advanced key 2021 discovery, development and regulatory activities in the second quarter. We reported top line results for the cabo/atezo doublet in first-line HCC from COSMIC-312 and in metastatic CRPC from COSMIC-021 cohort 6. And we'll update you on regulatory feedback and details for upcoming presentations for these two trials in due course.We plan to file new sNDAs for Cabo in these indications, pending positive regulatory feedback, along with the submission of COSMIC-311 in DTC, which was accepted for priority review with the PDUFA date of December 4, 2021.The full portfolio of late-stage COSMIC and CONTACT trials with cabozantinib ICI combinations continues to move forward according to plan. Our early clinical pipeline is advancing with significant progress in the XL092 program the XL102 Phase 1 trial and the initiation of"
"This is part of the problem but I believe that lack of innovative pipeline , emerging heavy competition in RCC are the overriding issues. It’s probably fairly valued now and there is simply no excitement about future of Exelixis . There are at least 100 biotech companies with late stage exciting oncology drugs , yes many of them will fail but Wall Street values future potential growth and at this point Exelixis is perceived as a stale , boring entity . It will not get any credit beyond proven sales (minus some ) MMM performance yesterday was also mediocre, he was angry at times , irritated , did not inspire confidence"
"Exelixis is almost 17 , probably they found 1 extra script written last month and that is reflected in rising stock price"
"Time to announce a stock buyback and an aggressive one at that. I've been saying this for close to two years now and almost everyone said no way, not needed, etc....Well now I think most of the nay sayers are also saying the same. The company needs a boost and there's nothing else coming in the near horizon. I've lightened my holdings over the last three months to get into other things and will continue to do so until they make a buyback announcement. Time for EXEL to put atleast 25% of their cash on hand to good use. $400 Million Dollar buyback would be the perfect shot in the arm for EXEL!!"
Cabo latest news no impact premarket?!
Wow! Shorts in complete control.
"Great news, but I wish that it was released on Monday.GLTALsNeil"
another approval means more potential sales of Cabo. Good news!
I just love to watch exel tumbling. The only good news is that mm and his cohorts are losing money as well or should I say aren’t making as much money as they are used to. When this stock hits ten dollars the sec should start investigating.
"I'm back... after my ""stop limit"" triggered at $22.25. Still came out about 14% on the plus side (very lucky). For the past few days, I got back in under $18 with even more shares from my original investment. This is a great buying opportunity. Mick and Michael will be posting with negative comments about me trading this stock and not investing in it. Oh well, at least I have already muted Michael. I have no problem with Mick... maybe not yet :-).I was wrong and surprised with the data for C312. However, I do agree with Duck on his opinion and I respect his knowledge of Exel and his intelligent. I'm not going to post much, because of childish behavior from a few people on this mb. I rather spend my time reading intelligent comments and opinions on IV. Good luck to the long and non-whining investors.Thank you Duck for spending your time sharing your view/opinion with us."
"It’s boring , since Exelixis has collapsed to irrelevance. Nothing to watch anymore"
"Hello,I bought my first shares of Exelixis this morning, after I saw the renal cell announcement on my stock feed; though I'd heard of Exelixis' reputation, I hadn't done due diligence before my purchase -- it was an instinctive/immediate purchase. I've been reading over Exelixis' website/pipeline but would appreciate if someone here, a long-term investor, would comment on which trials are in stage 3 or if there are any upcoming NDA submissions -- whatever they think is a potential milestone. Thank you, Sienna."

"That was fast, just recover my short positions @ $17, exactly what I predicted earlier! No hurry to buy, SP will drift range bound for weeks before next PR, such as earning. @Billy boy, are you listing??? This is not a 'buy & hold' idea, you have to trade it to profit from it. Enough fun here, let's move on to other targets, all touched support level and bounce: SESN, IMGN, AMRN just to name a few."
"Indeed... $SESN will be like $EXEL... or even 2-3 times better... I bought $EXEL twice $2,34 & $3,28 in 2015......sold in 2017 once at $24,36 and later at $26,15... had not expected that it will run even to $32,50 ...Sooooo expect LONG RUN, friends..."

"IMHO, I recommend everyone who is holding Long EXEL, we write a request to BLACKROCK, a financial Investment, discussing with Exelixis in working for shareholders by approve the buyback company stock. This is the only way making the stock price rally much higher to a decent price. BLACKROCK is one of the major holders of EXEL. I strongly believe that if BLACKROCK listens and accepts our requests, we will see the buyback stock should be approved by Exelixis's BOD.GLTA"
"If MMM and the BOD aren't willing to support the share price with a share repurchase at these levels, then when? They should pledge to buyback an amount equal to this year's free cash flow. Lets go. Its time.GLTALsNeil"

I have a feeling we will end in RED today
I expect multiple upgrades tomorrow. The performance of this quarter is unbelievable and confirms the strength of Carbo and Exelixis.
"Just counted, about more than 20 officers/directors, the entire upper managements transaction (insiders activities), all sale orders and none buy, I mean zero (0) purchase!!! If that's not the warning sign, I don't know what else is: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EXEL/insider-transactions?p=EXEL They are selling, why should you hold it? They don't have faith in their own company, why should you? Are all longs (opposite of smart) or what?"
Don't forget to sell at 25.
Nice move when Nasdag index is down...pending news! perhaps...

"Exelixis 2021 summary for shareholders: Script numbers not so good , studies fail to meet primary endpoints , pipeline non existent , executive team weak, cabozantinib obsolete , workforce morale low, competition much better"
"With $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which is more than enough to support its ongoing clinical research. With a sustained double-digit growth rate and forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 24, Exelixis is a big-time bargain."
ah 10 more days and my short call expires worthless.
Insider sold 55k…good or bad sign?
"From MMM earnings call:“Exelixis also advanced key 2021 discovery, development and regulatory activities in the second quarter. We reported top line results for the cabo/atezo doublet in first-line HCC from COSMIC-312 and in metastatic CRPC from COSMIC-021 cohort 6. And we'll update you on regulatory feedback and details for upcoming presentations for these two trials in due course. We plan to file new sNDAs for Cabo in these indications, pending positive regulatory feedback,”This guy is insane , the efficacy data generated by Exelixis in CRPC and HCC is so underwhelming that it’s almost embarrassing to file sNDA for these indications ."
Waiting to sell at 25.Atfter that is a waiting game.
"not sure it this is good or bad....but it seems like it is not fighting the dow in which direction.....dow is up, so is exel...if it is down, it might still be up a little....but does not seem to be battling for which direction to go in price."

Unless this company fixes their comp for senior leadership and tie it to their stock performance rather than FDA approvals, stock will linger.

"Are you ready for tomorrow? Over 6M shares on Friday is huge! This is not all due to re-balancing of the indexes. I have a feeling that something big is coming before the market opens. Something leaks. Most likely a great read out for C312 or positive feedback from FDA regarding to C-021.... but it could be a rumor of a BO offer (joking)??? Looking back since Jan 2020, excluding Mar 2020 (Covid - 6 days), there are only 19 days with daily volume > 5M shares. Five of those days are related to 9ER's read out in April '20. Two days were related to JP Morgan Jan '20 ($4B by 2025). Few days for each of the quarterly reports. What is interesting are the volume movements prior to major events. Somehow, the volume seems to increase a few days prior to a major event (good or bad). As for Friday, volume increased with uptick in SP is a great sign. What a way to come back from my vacation on Friday to see the volume and SP spikes as we were landing at the closing minutes. Good luck to us all!"

Finally
"Go Exel !!! Mmm u r the very best, keep up the good work - $13 within 1 - 2 weeks and $6 by 10/1 - I luv exel !!"
Another great day for exel.
"Unlikely anyone sold a share of EXEL today because of stock based compensation or lack of management incentives. Stock based compensation is 100% aligned with shareholders. Much more aligned than offering up cash bonus checks. The Cabo sales number was unexpectedly good. Organic growth. Can't ask for much more. The path to a multi billion dollar revenue generating franchise is clear. This is a strong buy using anyone's criteria. Won't even bother speculating on todays PPS action, as it could be all kinds of mechanisms at play. In the end, a company providing this type of growth will see a dramatic increase in valuation. The HC Wainwright $64 price target issued today is only the beginning of the valuation adjustment conversations. It's inevitable."

You don’t see much retail selling pressure since this is non-marginable at majority of the brokerages. 80-85% owned by institutional investors.Shorts splurged way too many shares yesterday.Be patient.Gl!
My prediction is that EXEL will go back to 22-25 range by August 2021.
"Insider is buying the company stock. Director Cohen Charles is buying 80,000 shares of exel stock on July 6 and 7."
Long and strong here too. Add of it drops again at 16-16.5. Will return to normal 20's soon or later. Don't panic guys. This is good pick. Be strong.
awful lot of hype for a routine decent day....long awaited......and with this management....how will it look a week from now?
"Past two trading days, it gained nicely 72 cents and today it lost 74 cents."
Exel has real product revenue of 1.2 bln and cash of around 1.2 bln.Market cap is 5 bln.Gl!
Beat earnings by 23 cents/share!!
Congratulations exel you did it a new low for the year. Let’s keep it going. I am in at five dollars a share.
Bought some today. Couldn’t resist. I’ll buy another lot if it continues to drop.
"Nektar report The first this past quarter, BMS and Nektar expanded the strategy in RCC to a new collaboration with Exelixis, who will conduct a study evaluating BEMPEG plus nivolumab with novel next-generation TKI-XO92. The study will also include cancers, including cancer."

The Sadistic set has been the only group posting lately.
Looks like no one is interested in exel anymore. And they shouldn’t be.
"As I predicted 50 minutes ago, SP retest $16.50.Don't buy it yet, support 1 (s1) of $16.16 is where this is heading to (all longs, are you listing?).And if s1 don't hold, s2 of $14.11 is next. Shorting EXEL has a much better chance to profit from it, not to mention overall sentiments in the market is bearish, it would add more fuel to the fire."
"Arthur (Expert???), please stop contaminating this board with your unending negativity and whining. You own thousands of shares of EXEL and yet, you disparage and belittle the company and other shareholders. You sound more like a psychopath than a shareholder. Grow up, please!!!"
"Keep pumping while management reaps the free options , just look at the last five year chart it speaks for itself￼"
Reality and sanity are finally returning to EXEL stock pricing. Let the rise continue unabated!

going back to 25 quickly
Whew! Back to $20 and won't be looking back.
"OK, We were wrong by 2 days when we posted that $EXEL would hit $21.35 the next day! Yesterday's after mkt close stk ran up to $21.40 on 754,000 shares traded. With the news on FDA approval, 2 months earlier than expected, we now see big pharma taking a look at a b.o. BTW , someone posting by name of ANONYMOUS should be ignored and deleted, just another short stk basher"
Why the obsession with shorts? Only 11 million shares short out of a float of 289 million. 1/2 of 1%. That shows that all these loud mouths bashing this company do not have the balls to short this stock. Or the capital. That also means no explosive short squeeze either.
It would be nice if EXEL closed over $20 before the long weekend!
"I have been here since 2007, and this was probably the best quarterly report in the company's history. It also appears that despite the recent trial read out that was somewhat disappointing, they have other irons in the fire. We never expected everything to play out perfectly, so the future still appears healthy. My only however, is my great disapointment that mgt did not announce a share repurchase program. I still think they need to use ongoing free cash flows after investment in R&D etc to take advantage of the low share price and reduce the large float. we shareholders should push for this. It is a sound strategy that is failing to provide a return for its shareholders over the last five years, which s appalling. GLTALsNeil"

"Heading Back to 17 territory , absolutely not worth more than that"
This is an R&D company now in many ways. We are spending $600M a year now in R&D. As the previous poster said we have about 50 trials ongoing with Cabometyx for almost every possible cancer indication as a primary or secondary treatment. Most of them in combination with another compound. We should expect to hit on some of these and that should fuel growth long term. If you do not believe in the management and the science you obviously should not own the stock. I do.
The reality is that Exelixis performance last quarter was barely C or C+ and the problem is that the financial numbers will never get better ( because of growing competition) and the company has no prospects for growth and no exciting pipeline . That’s why real experts ( like me) just yawn at these quarterly numbers

InsidersDumping once again
"I have found that the problem with investing in oncology stocks is that the science is moving so fast that by the time governmental approvals are achieved, the science has become obsolete."
"Let’s see if any of Exelixis leadership folks buys the stock at this “discounted “ bargain price . Show us some confidence in the company you are managing ! The answer is - no, they are not super smart but what they know well is not to touch this stock unless given for free."
"Insiders are exercising and holding on to their shares vs selling them on same day at market prices (except two transactions in June and July which must have been preplanned sales). Although company had announced great numbers last week, stock did not have any reaction; market is sending a strong signal to management team and the board that unless they take some concrete steps to support the stock price, the gravy train of making monthly gains from option exercises is disappearing. Let's hope management starts to work for the the shareholders finally....."

Most longs are sick to the teeth with financial management incompetence at Excel. The shorts have had a field day but every tide changes direction.
"how old are a lot of you, I am assuming over 40 years old since most want a buyback. NO..you don't want a buyback. If they converted their cash to bitcoin when it dipped they would have nearly a 50% GAIN in cash... and could use that to buy out more. Biotech/tech will start merging IMO"

Is there any difference if exel finishes today at 16.50 or 17.25? Would either of those finishes reinforce the bullish or bearish sentiment?
Exelixis Q2 2021 net income surges 44% YoY on approval of Cabometyx
Well they should have added bitcoin to the balance sheet around 28-30k. We would be sitting on a nice gain in profits and share price of 1.5-2x higher than current level. The cash they are sitting on is eroding quickly with inflation
Yeah probably popping the price so insiders can sellSome. Ore shares tomorrow

"Reading some the comments on this MB, one might believe that being a ""Cabo"" only story was somehow a new thing. Cabo is projected, based upon current topline data, to grow revenues by double digits for at least the next couple years (24% in '21, 26% in 2022). This is why the price target is $30 (66% increase from here). That's not my estimate, that is from the analyst community. And with that projected growth comes increasing valuations. There is no way around that. No matter what any MB guru claims."

"Exelixis Statement on the Passing of Two Senior ExecutivesALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 6, 2021-- Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced that Gisela M. Schwab, M.D., the company’s President, Product Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, passed away over the weekend. Dr. Schwab had been on a medical leave of absence since June 18, 2021.Exelixis President and Chief Executive Officer Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., issued the following statement on behalf of the Exelixis team and the company’s Board of Directors:“All of us at Exelixis are deeply, deeply saddened by Gisela’s passing. A brilliant oncologist turned clinical development professional, Gisela was a remarkable leader, mentor, and friend. She was beloved by her colleagues, who were inspired by her strategic thinking, tireless work ethic, and above all, her unwavering dedication to improving care and outcomes for patients with cancer.Sadly, Gisela’s passing comes on the heels of another treasured colleague, Jon Berndt, our Senior Vice President of Sales, who passed away last Wednesday following a lengthy battle with cancer. Losing Gisela and Jon in the same week, both of whom were life sciences industry veterans, is a reminder of our fragility and that cancer knows no bounds. Like Gisela, Jon was a wonderful friend and colleague, and his passing is an enormous loss to all who knew him and to the Exelixis family.”"

"There is nothing that will reverse demise of this company , down to single digits after next earnings report."
"Sean Williams mentioned the following on the Motley Fool:Exelixis has close to six dozen ongoing clinical trials involving Cabometyx as a monotherapy or combination treatment. Not all of these studies are going to succeed. But if even a handful succeed, such as the CheckMate-9ER study, Cabometyx's label will expand and demand will rise.Investors will also note that Exelixis is swimming in cash. The company ended March with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. That's nearly 30% of the company's market cap, relative to where it closed on June 28. Exelixis's cash gives it plenty of capital to fund its internal research engine, and it might even allow the company to go shopping for other assets."

That 73 cent jump exel took last Thursday.....2 trading days to disappear.......how many weeks to get it all back?
Remember that most members of message boards like this form a support group of sorts trying to justify their ( sometimes ill-conceived) investment .It naturally tends to attract wildly optimistic and unrealistic views while realists and sober analysts are disparaged The problem is that these MBs often perpetuate false hopes for many who would have been better served by cutting their losses and moving on to professional activities they may actually be good at ( not biotech investing)
Gene therapy is still a few years out. Investors might actually tire and move to more secure/proven treatments in the mean time. EXEL is a neutral. You can sell calls above 21
"This is a great entry point for new money. Buy the dip. Advanced liver is a tough indication to treat, and Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is the 3rd rated PD-L1 behind MRK and BMY's offerings. Our trials with Keytruda and Optivo are the ones to watch. JMHO"
Its unfortunate the mistakes made by MMM over the last two to three years. Most good growth biotechs have atleast doubled in share price during the last three years and EXEL is close to its 3 year low of $15. No share buyback during this timeframe meant no show of confidence by management and the BoD. It still may not be too late for an activist shareholder (like an Alex Dinner or equal) to make a play and look to get the company acquired. Odds are low that this can happen but I guess one can continue to wish.
Anyone thinking this dog will be back to the 20's this year is dreaming. Its a one drug company that has nothing new for years. Limp biscuit is the new term. Management won't reward investors with a buyback. Ugh
I knew I should’ve loaded up at 16.19

"FDA Approves Pembrolizumab Plus Lenvatinib for Frontline Advanced RCC.This OncLive article came out on Aug. 11th. At first glance, this headline could spell trouble for EXEL's investors. However as I was reading the data, it come to my attention that this combo is more toxic than 9ER and KN426. IMHO, this was what I have expected back in Feb. No doubt that the ORR,PFS and OS data are strong for this combo (CLEAR), but it is really? With much more higher % of favorable risk and lower % of poor risk study participants in the trial, the safety data look awful. 1) 37% (UP FROM 10% discontinuation presented for this combo back in Feb. at the ASCO GU) of patients in the study PERMANENTLY discontinued treatment of either agent or both because of toxicity. 2) 78%... >3 of 4 of patients in this combo required dose INTERRUPTIONS due to toxicity. Of this 78% dose interruptions, 55% due to pembrolizumab and 73% due to lenvatinib.3) 4.3% of patients experienced FATAL adverse reactions.4) Study participants profile: 27% (vs 21% 9ER) favorable risk; 64% intermediate; only 9% (19% 9ER) were poor.5) 51% of patients experienced serious adverse reactions on the investigative arm.The safety data for this combo doesn't look good. In Feb, the KOLs community (including myself) think this combo might be the new SOC in RCC. Now seeing the safety data, I'm don't think the medical community will be taking the risk with this combo when 9ER and KN426 are much safer alternative. 51% serious adverse reactions and 78% required dose interruptions are too much. I think we are back to a ""two horses"" race between 9ER and KN426. Quality of Life data will be key for 9ER. This might be the reason for a positive day for the SP. Crossing my fingers.... we might see $2B product revenue for RCC by 2022.Good luck to all long investors."

hedge funds are buying EXEL dated July 13?
Be nice to see EXEL get a BO like TRIL did today.

"any chance that a lot of shorts need to be cleared away before the hype kicks in, and exel zooms up to 19? any chance sharapova has some time for me, now that she quit that tennis stuff?"
Bristol Myers touting good 5 year survival rates for their Opdivo YervoyCombination. Opdivo Yervoy Cabozantinib phase 3 trial results expected in next 6 months. Google Angus Liu Yervoy for September 16 story.
Let's rally in to the close! Finish GREEN

Massive short squeeze coming across the desks!
Cabo rev = 284.2 million
Buying more shares today…… I expected will get back to $22 this week
"Is exel more or less in sync with the dow......that has not been the case all the time...often the dow would be up and exel would be down, or vice versa......if the whole market is getting ready for a tumble, it could get kind of nasty."
Exel flying high today.
