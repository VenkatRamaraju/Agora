Analog Devices $ADI and Maxim Integrated $MXIM Merger - Acquisition News and Eventshttps://mergerarbitragelimited.com/analog-devices-adi-and-maxim-integrated-mxim-merger/
10% buyback is a big deal.
yahoo still zhowing PE at 41 but based on 2017 results it is actually less than 20. Anyone know when these numbers will show up on their financial numbers?
So what is going on today??? Somebody must know something bad has or will happen.
"New 52-week high today. Ho hum, from the lack of life on this board."
"The entire semiconductor sector appears to be under fire from so called ""analysts"" that are actually jack-of-all-trades but masters of NONE. Their archaic thinking in traditional cyclical rotations of the semiconductor industry is forcing stocks prices lower. Even when most chip and equipment companies are crushing earnings, are producing at max capacity, increasing prices, and raising guidance. Global demand would be high regardless of any shortage. 5G, AI, EV, crypto, data centers, cloud tech, gaming, eSports were already ensuring this growth and demand. Now add the new infrastructure spending and the global ""arms race"" that's taking place. We are in the beginning of a super cycle like never seen, likely lasting many years. Semiconductors are the new #1 global resource....the new oil.(Fabless) companies like $NVDA, $AMD, $MRVL, $AVGO, $QCOM design the most advanced and sought after semiconductors in the world. (Fab-owning) companies like $TSM, $TXN, $ADI, $QRVO manufacture the chips. Companies like $AMAT, $ASML, $LRCX, $KLAC, $UCTT, $ICHR make all the equipment and materials used by those chip manufacturers. High tide raises all boats! .....and many of these companies are already currently undervalued. GLTA"
Potential 8.2 billion revenue increase expected sounds good to me. In.

"don't worry about $TXN slow down. It is exposed to several categories, like analog chips, which already weren't growing. $MCHP $ADI $NXPI."
So this is the new board. For a merger it's pretty quiet. It's about as quiet as the Maxim board was.
"If it looks, feel, tastes and smells like mid-summer market churn, it is mid-summer market churn which has the appearance in many sectors and price consolidation which is a price correction against time. Most semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks are range bound and have been for a trading range since late April/Early May 2021 with $TXN, $ADI, $AMAT, $LRCX, $AMD, $KLAC and many others as examples. Enjoy your summer and seek buying opportunities near the lower end of the price range bound from early May onward. There is nothing new here just typical summer market action. The demand for semiconductors will only increase with time and that demand curve doesn't appear linear but rather more exponential."
I think this week will be a good week for ADI to report earnings and hoping all goes well .. 94.79 to 100 ?
Ok gross margin of 70% ...let me put it in TSLA context ...that's 7 to 10times more profitable then TSLA and all those EV cars need ADI Chips for batteries and electronics to function.
What's the status of the merger with Maxim? Thought it would settle in July.
ADI and KLAC were both up over 3% today and yet both boards are quiet. Go figure.
"A beat, a raise, and the Maxim deal is looking good. ADI is firing on all cylinders right now."
Analog Devices is down 4.91% to 171.05
"Great stock to own . great exposure to 5G, EV, AI and more. got it at 117 few months ago and today 158. it also pay dividends."
