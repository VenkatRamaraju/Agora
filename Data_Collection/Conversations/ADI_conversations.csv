What ADI wainting for??https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/290343/maxim-integrated-mxim-surges-stock-moves-71-higher?cid=CS-MKTWTCH-HL-290343
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Rumor out about a collaboration between ADI and BIDU on autonomous systems. Anyone able to confirm this? Haven't found any official PR yet.
Solid results! Great company and attractive valuation.
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 128.68
"5G is getting hot XLNX , NOK and INSG and $ADI could rocket"
"Wow what does this company have to do for recognition? Invent fire or the light bulb, gasoline perhaps! This is ridiculous that this company is trading around 19 times earnings??? Really And guiding well past current estimates for the next quarter. This should be a $100/ share company merely on their sustained growth and increasing revenues and earnings estimates. Most of their strength is attributed to the automotive sector, seems somewhat comparable to NVIDIA's recent growth spurt that sent them sustained past $160. I think someone needs to dig in and see the gold this company has uncovered in its markets> $100 plus soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"sensors are going to dominate in the future. autonomous cars, robots, drones, smart devices, all rely upon sensors. this is an absolute gem."
"Another crazy day, i saw a strong bounce at 83.99. Should the target be met there, brokers?"
"If it looks, feel, tastes and smells like mid-summer market churn, it is mid-summer market churn which has the appearance in many sectors and price consolidation which is a price correction against time. Most semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks are range bound and have been for a trading range since late April/Early May 2021 with $TXN, $ADI, $AMAT, $LRCX, $AMD, $KLAC and many others as examples. Enjoy your summer and seek buying opportunities near the lower end of the price range bound from early May onward. There is nothing new here just typical summer market action. The demand for semiconductors will only increase with time and that demand curve doesn't appear linear but rather more exponential."
"Was it Merill or Goldman that recently gave ADI a mid $90's price target?? Goldman did the same with CGNX and it went from $79 to currently $93, in a month to month and halfs time. We are seeing the top tech explosion occuriing, many new improvements and changes coming for our lives! Peace"
Why is ADI down pre-market.
Not much being said since DI crashed to mid 80's
have to eat my words going to be buying Monday
Up 3% in pre market
Analog Devices is one of the least dependent semiconductor companies in terms of reliance. Their percentage of business with China is between 10-15% .
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 137.99
Earnings call must be going very well
10% buyback is a big deal.
$100 before ER
ADI is down -4.91% to 89.93
This stock has been basing for a few days… And now bad news (CEO exercising options...to purchase whatever millionaires purchase) is not moving the stock down…It’s bottomed… It’s too cheap… And the big boys are starting to accumulate...slowly...
"Every after hours, when the stock is down ADI is bought back up to the closing price...this has been happening for a little while now...wonder if ADI is buying back these shares...PE of 16.1 against YR2018 earnings...Management is very efficient soooo I wouldn’t doubt them buying back shares now at these levels..."
Its funny - may be ADI should also stop doing the most advanced Semiconductor Chips and simply do some dumbo dating APP to get Capital from wallstreet; This is the center of all the chip shortage issue with immense pricing power and stock doesn't move - crazy markets.
Wondering about TXN's desire to grow Analog sales and entry to further get into auto sector= Could they step up and make a bid for ADI? Not to mention I know P Maphily who has been dead on is touting the sensor market and Analog's grip on this area going forward. He mentioned ADI an easy double from here.
Analog Devices is buying Linear Tech in a cash & stock deal. $ADI is up 4% on the news
Analog Devices reached a 52 Week low at 86.32
"anything with a PE over 30 is getting roasted, regardless of growth prospects.I am hoping this gets down to the 130s but dont think I will see it."
"Clearly Cramer is right if you want a telemedicine play buy whatever he said... SDC is not a telemedicine play! SDC is a dental play, an orthodontic play, an in-office dental esthetic play, an out-of-office teledentistry play, a consumer play, a beauty play, a low cost alternative to a life-changing makeover play, a play on a severely undervalued company, and just a play on one of the few great values left in an inflated market!! Is it any wonder it’s my largest position and even more than my cash position. It’s even more than my next three positions combined: $FIT $CNK and $AMC - I’m in no hurry either - I certainly understand if you want your payback in a few months! I’m only 63 so I can wait 1-5 years for $SDC... I found a great entry today in $ADI too."
"Yahoo finance recently deleted dividend information from their stock charts, thus depriving investors of valuable information. Will dividend information be restored to the chart?"
"Whenever Cramer endorses it is a ""kiss of death"""
"nice earning, just got 50 call at 97.50."
ADI and KLAC were both up over 3% today and yet both boards are quiet. Go figure.
"do not worry, adi is solid as a rock. whole sector is down but only temporarily. I am long and will sleep well knowing it will rebound soon and I will get a dividend increase to boot!"

recent article from barrons states adi not worth much more than 12x earnings. hope they are wrong.
something went wrong?
ADI reached a new 52 Week High at 96.92
"Broadcom AVGO growing tired of Qcom and their forced purchase of NXP, interersting talks going on while there is a Gold nugget not too far from the reach ;)"
"again blood bath, whats happening, its such a good ticket to buy and short sellers have made it reached below its low value, whats happening?"
eventually bulls will win like every day recently
giving back everything it made yesterday...short sellers in force...buy on rumor and sell on news...wait until we see what the sellside analysts are bad mouthing...
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 157.84
Got some on pull back TXN maybe put a buy in for this they like too buyout people
Regained 50 DMA nicely and even more call buying exp. March...
what's happening?
clearly another sector wide move. appears bots are selling tech and buying banks.
ADI: Fix your report. We can't read it when it requires too much horizontal scrolling. Never seen this difficulty before. The SEC will not tolerate this!
long for 94 before Chrismas
"I see Broadcom AVGO buying ADI Analogic devices much stronger growth potential to enter the sensory market!!! Paul Maniphly top hedge fund guy I subscribe to says ADI will double in a year due to this strength , Not sure they will be here till then too cheap!!"
ADI is up 4.92% to $87.83
"I am thru with this one, runs up and reports strong numbers and raised future numbers and tanks?? This is a stable Air craft carrier in t his space about to dominate the sensor market and the street treats it like this? Of the 8 Analyst ratings that came out after the numbers, all raised the price target with 80% of the big houses seeking $105 plus in price target raises and the shares go down?? This one proves itself each earnings report with beats and raises. This time the mentioned a large paydown of debt that has to be received with open arms?? What the hell is going on here, the houses all raised their price targets and you know they were adding to their holding before these came out. There is total uncertainty with Qcom and Broadcom which only can be pointing at the next best performer if not for Broadcom then intel to bolster their Auto chip business with Mobleye and the steady strength and future potential of the Sensor market with ADI. Texas Instruments and their foray into the driverless and sensor and Analog business, a TXN-ADI tie-up makes total sense in the consolifation phase of the chip sector??"
Held crucial support levels… Now small call buying has begun with March expiration… Just another sign this thing has bottomed.
ADI ramping after earnings.
"The entire semiconductor sector appears to be under fire from so called ""analysts"" that are actually jack-of-all-trades but masters of NONE. Their archaic thinking in traditional cyclical rotations of the semiconductor industry is forcing stocks prices lower. Even when most chip and equipment companies are crushing earnings, are producing at max capacity, increasing prices, and raising guidance. Global demand would be high regardless of any shortage. 5G, AI, EV, crypto, data centers, cloud tech, gaming, eSports were already ensuring this growth and demand. Now add the new infrastructure spending and the global ""arms race"" that's taking place. We are in the beginning of a super cycle like never seen, likely lasting many years. Semiconductors are the new #1 global resource....the new oil.(Fabless) companies like $NVDA, $AMD, $MRVL, $AVGO, $QCOM design the most advanced and sought after semiconductors in the world. (Fab-owning) companies like $TSM, $TXN, $ADI, $QRVO manufacture the chips. Companies like $AMAT, $ASML, $LRCX, $KLAC, $UCTT, $ICHR make all the equipment and materials used by those chip manufacturers. High tide raises all boats! .....and many of these companies are already currently undervalued. GLTA"
ADI ........Great long and short term play
"Conf. Call basically stated for the next 2 quarters there will be no momentum of revenue growth. So ADI's bet is on 5G picking up in US and other emerging markets at coming Q. Issue is if global economic slowing down due to trade war, it will also drag future corp investment world wide. My view is even US & China w 1st phase agreement reached by yr end, next phase will be very difficult as gaps in between both countries is wider."
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 143.33
why does Yahoo show eps of 2.07. Looks like EPS for 2017 is approx 5.61 which makes a PE of about 14.
This is BS. They got upgraded.
Motion Sensing devices are the future in a Post Covid-19 World! Stock Up!
ADI numbers are very solid: Looking for $120 target!
Analog Devices is up 4.92% to 140.07
"As a engineer in the valley- Analog Device considered a company with great products, the first which comes to mind when designing hardware with analog components"
Should I buy ADI or XLNX? Don’t say both
I went ahead and added this one to my portfolio today. Thinking about adding TXN also. So if my history of losing stock picks continues TXN will shoot to the stars before I get in and ADI will disappear into the pink sheets LOL. I thought it only fair to warn other longs. I think there is a crowd of shorts following my every move!
$MU Al Gore Beats the Market by Buying Applied Materials Stock and Selling Analog Devices$AMAT $ADI
50 day MA tested and held...bounce please...
"Zacks raised ADI rating to Strong Buy from Buy, I'm buying more at low!"
"if mchp is down on tax impact, what should we wait from ADI ER??"
"Decent results, not inconsistent with those of TXN although TXN got a boost after they reported. On adjusted EPS, ADI is at 20X TTM EPS while TXN is at 25X.. as much as I like TXN as a company, I think once we get past this softness, ADI has better growth opportunities at a better valuation."
"ADI price actions is too nasty, given the market is up today?"
"Earnings beat, Revenue beat, raised projections, but the stock is down $3.79 ???"
The PPS is going to fall. Buy $90 June puts at $0.60.
Bought more at 115.00
Analog Devices is down 6.91% to 99.61
ADI Maxim merger approved by ADI shareholders.
Looking good for longs
I think it dropped because they were not excited enough about the new Apple phone release.Avgo mentioned in their conference call that their revenues from the new phone would be in 4Q.Rarely does a company provide guide two quarters out...
"Besides my position on $ADI, I'm considering $RNECY as well to beef up my semiconductor positions.any thoughts?"
A sudden dip of $1 per share. Never be that overwhelming for a rise.
"Friends I honestly feel AVGO will step in and own Analog Devices. Company has SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much going on and in development with their Sensor technologies, Driverless cars and Machine Automation. ADI is trading at a major discount to it's peers and IS THE BEST IN CLASS!! Their I said it. Watch AVGO-Broadcom step away from Qcom and buy ADI. I see a bid coming in at low $100's Starting at $120 and being bought at $128 to close it!!! Good luck this one is easy!!"
ADI consistently managed it's balance sheet well over the decades. Pretty sure they will continue after acquisition. 
"As $AAPL buyout $INTC 5G modem for iPhones watch $ISNG and $NOK rocket same as $KEYS and $ADI , 5G should explode soon HOT"
why this stock is down despite of excellent results?
Awesome price to begin a position or add to your holdings based on your cost basis.
Will we touch 100 in Jan. ?
short ratio at 11? seems like a risky bet against a company whose products are needed for every growing high tech application that exists.someone get the reddit army on this
"Yesterday’s Jim Cramer Lightning Round Cramer said “buy, buy, buy” ADI and mentioned transformational merger...(swallow with a grain of salt)...ha"
Huge buying opportunity!!!
"Bros, I get trapped at 92.8 and finally out at 95.5. It's really a good ticket. But the two month' experience is really tough. I will be back when it goes down."
How do we come to a day when peope pursuse the risky and worthless blockchain but ignore the leading companies which really do something good.
"based on lat 4 qtrs I show $4.61 eps which PE of 18.7. factoring in growth and PE of 25, seems $145 share price is reasonable. Bonus 2% divi. I am long and buying more."
"Did anyone realize here ..all those chip shortage for ford , GM etc due to supply issue of these kind of companies. They are priotizing EV supply chips. Anyway earnings tommorow ,GLTA I am expecting a blow out roof top."

"So, great quarter and good forecast for next quarter. Why did it go down?"
Analog Devices Inc (ADI) President & CEO Vincent Roche Sold $8.5 million of Shares
"According to Analog Devices, Dr. Su is stepping down from its board of directors.Evidently to devote more time to AMD. Alright, Lisa!"
Earnings beat and good guidance :)
"Management noted that the results came amid continuing “trade and macro uncertainty.” I think that is just a lame excuse, other companies are not using that excuse. Revenue is decrasing, EPS is decreasing...stock should fall to $100 to $105 range."
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 141.79
Stock is acting nicely…ADI’s presentation at the CES tech conference in Vegas included comments that they could have up to 10 products (chips) in each autonomous vehicle… That’s huge (revenue) and price action as following this news...
A split soon wouldn't be the worst thing for this stock.
"A beat, a raise, and the Maxim deal is looking good. ADI is firing on all cylinders right now."
I will hold my shares till $100.00
"Of course, I sold my small position y'day for like a few pennies gain. and NOW it FINALLY gaps up... UGGGGHHHH!"
ADI reached a new 52 Week Low at $76.75
Anyone catch the interview David Faber(CNBC) had with Vincent Roache (CEO ADI) WOW. ADI is in all the rightspots when it comes to 5G & 5G related industries & EV battery mgmt. Looks to be a long Runway with thembring on the merger with Maxim
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 152.10
is the 2 billion dollar repurchase of common stock by ADI board a good sign ?
"This is a prime example of ""playing the game"" and shows how easily the stock market is manipulated. Still, with an initial pop ADI had after earnings one had to expect some profit taking, because it nearly always happens with stocks that pop up really high immediately after earnings. Give it a day or two and it will settle and start to rise again"
ADI hits new high at $175.25!
look at the revenue declines yoy this market is topping out
ADI reached a new 52 Week High at 103.18
"not sure where sites like yahoo get their financial data. like most sites, yahoo shows Eps of 2.07 yet adi 2016 anual report shows 2.76. why the difference. based on actual qtr results for 2017, EPS for year will is 5.68 per share. If and when financial services show these actual results, adi will trade from 96 to 100 per share."
ADI is down 4.91% to $78.59

Analog Devices reached a 52 Week low at 94.54
"Merger of ADI - MXIM: Got a proxy vote for the merger, dilution of shareholder equity by some 30% and voted my 2000 shares against this merger. Would recommend other owners to do the same - MXIM brings nothing new to ADI unlike LLTC which had a strong power franchise. LLTC despite its top notch power franchise has taken ~ 4 years to begin paying off. If MXIM had a HV power .. it might have got interesting as it could play into the EV power market. At best MXIM is a # 3 in their markets anywhere. ADI has a tendency of overpaying for revenue and MXIM is an example - Let's not dilute our ownership of ADI and send a message to Vincent Roche & Co that the owners don't like the company going for bad acquisitions. Vote NO to increase # of shares."
"Apple represented approximately 14% of ADI’s total revenue in fiscal year 2017. But Apple is not relying on ADI any more. This could significantly impact ADI’s revenues. Other facts including Headwinds, Tailwinds, and Risks are here: http://alamg.com/report-analog-devices-adi-factors-that-must-be-considered-before-investing-12.html"
ADI looks strong at this level (around 85)I think it won't fall more
$ADI Target Raised by Barclays Overweight USD 150 » USD 170
Good opportunity to buy in!!!
Need a knockout 1st qtr report in Feb and a nice divi increase.
"OK I see TXN who is the ANALOG business seeking to get into Driverless and rest of auto bus. which ADI has, these two are primed to break out. TXN has been very quiet and ADI is slowly creeping up. Let's see what happens."
Don’t forget MXIM at a discount and being bought by ADI

ADI reached a new 52 Week Low at $80.13
ADI YTD increases only 23.9%. It is not high at all. The pull-back is stupid. I believe it has more room to run.
Buy this dip !
Nice profits....2.91Great P/E ratio!Stock should run today
Microchip produced a TREMENDOUS quarter and provided good guidance. Hopefully this means ADI will do the same. I hold both.

"FYI: Maxim mentions its “pending” merger with ADI on or before its July 27 earnings report. Maybe not a lock, but the finalization of this deal appears to be looking good."
BUY and HOLD just have to do it sometimes
"POLL: Guys, what happens with intc this week? If up, press , if down, press . Thanks in advance for your participation, and feel free to give your best reasoning for your vote.      or       $amd $nvda $brcm $TXN $qcom $amat $mu $adi $lcrx"
Should run a bit tomorrow on MU earnings and outlook
So this is the new board. For a merger it's pretty quiet. It's about as quiet as the Maxim board was.
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 146.16
Thoughts on earnings?
ADI hits new high at $133.32!
yahoo still zhowing PE at 41 but based on 2017 results it is actually less than 20. Anyone know when these numbers will show up on their financial numbers?
ADI reached a new 52 Week High at 95.58
next week 100
Did you ADIs see the IPNFF boom today. The NFL alumni association President said IPNFF is the leader in Fan Engagement. They are also a Microsoft partner & starting to boom today.
"TXN Teas Instruments has been somewhat quiet , perhaps they are ready ;)"
Currently trading at approximately 16.7 PE when using YR18 earnings estimates...inexpensive considering growth pipeline through 2020...
I believe the institutional brokers are shorting ADI and then pull it back to another surge. This ticket is really something underestimated.
"I have been trading for many years. Made a killing on Fitbit, Facebook and LinkedIn. I just went in this morning around 89 and do not have any doubt, not even 1% that this will hit 100 within 2 months. Very very strong, one of strongest stocks I have seen in a amazing positon with recent acquisition. You are just seeing some of that payout but will reap HUGE profits. This has nothing but upside. Can see 200$ by year end even. I am telling you, have not seen a stock this strong and such a great dividend. Guessing tomorrow will even see it hit 90 again. No doubt, amazing stock and I would buy up to 95."
Analog Devices is up 5.41% to 94.88
Great earnings and several analyst upgrades recently. So why is it down today?
"Adi is our strong semiconductor manufacturer here in the states. They recently acquired MXIM who solely manufacture semiconductors for EV automakers. This will make them a top player, still not as big as TSM, but there’s plenty of room for growth in this field."
This stock is at best a $40 stock. Come back in 2020 and prove me wrong
I think this week will be a good week for ADI to report earnings and hoping all goes well .. 94.79 to 100 ?
ADI is up 4.90% to 92.00
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 161.49
whats with the beatdown?
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 153.82
Any guesses on what the divy raise in Feb will be ?
I don't understand. I'm sure there's a lesson here somewhere but I haven't found it yet.
One of my buy orders executed today...this one. I'm in at $111. I own shares of MXIM also.
bit expensive but very well managed company with a room to grow on dividend department
"87% of this ticket is held by institutional brokerage, so they are driving away individual players."
Will likely run into earnings but don't be shocked for a decent sell off afterwards. Seems to always happen with high performing stocks.
Ok gross margin of 70% ...let me put it in TSLA context ...that's 7 to 10times more profitable then TSLA and all those EV cars need ADI Chips for batteries and electronics to function.
What does this mean? news for long?
Buying more every time it drops below 80. Sooner or later people will realize this company has a lot more than Apple parts to offer.
Another day with a large number of form 4 submissions.
slow steady progress. anticipate major upward move by end of feb.
This stock has peaked
"Guys I have a gut feeling Intel may be agresive with ADI's automotive arm and machine automation division, We'll see ? Good luck longs I like this CO!!!"

What's the status of the merger with Maxim? Thought it would settle in July.
another upgrade ubs raises price from 83$ to 94$
"Great stock to own . great exposure to 5G, EV, AI and more. got it at 117 few months ago and today 158. it also pay dividends."
Analog Devices is down 4.95% to 147.27
Why down premarket?
This was recommended as one of the top five tech stocks for 2021.
"Quote from an analyst from today's Barron's article: ""The margin upside looks to have been driven by operational efficiency, stability in Autos and Industrial, and the better than expected performance in Comms Infrastructure."" Conclusion is obvious...management are running a very efficient company. The article also lists a price target of $113!"
Potential 8.2 billion revenue increase expected sounds good to me. In.
Why do we have such a bad start today?
"42 billion in market cap for the ""growth semi company"" declining revenue at the end of a expansionary business cycle. 6 billion in rev. 1 billion in cash and over 6 billion in debt. A bunch of ""good will"" from the acquisition. And of course a terrible earnings report, but hey buy back more stock and boost the price."
Who is ADI’s primary competitors?
