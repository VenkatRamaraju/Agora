"Whenever Cramer endorses it is a ""kiss of death"""
Analog Devices reached a 52 Week low at 86.32
Divy raised 11% to .69/qtr !!!
clearly another sector wide move. appears bots are selling tech and buying banks.
I am honestly scratching my brain or leg where brain may be situated for all these millennials. This company is one of the reason why auto makers shutting their plants as demand is sky high..beats #$%$ out of earnings ....while u go chase some turd stocks. You deserve to be poor and look for government hand outs..I will buy more.
ADI: Fix your report. We can't read it when it requires too much horizontal scrolling. Never seen this difficulty before. The SEC will not tolerate this!

"So, great quarter and good forecast for next quarter. Why did it go down?"
"ADI has amazing potential. Have enjoyed the drop before I buy in. I won't wait too much longer, but hoping to get in somewhere in the 70s. Great long haul stock."
Analog Devices reached an all time high at 149.35
Anybody know why ADI still has not opened today? I see no news.

"if mchp is down on tax impact, what should we wait from ADI ER??"
recent article from barrons states adi not worth much more than 12x earnings. hope they are wrong.
Everybody sold on the green. Here's comes the ride.
i bought in yesterday morning at opening....
Stock is acting nicely…ADI’s presentation at the CES tech conference in Vegas included comments that they could have up to 10 products (chips) in each autonomous vehicle… That’s huge (revenue) and price action as following this news...
Another bloody day.
I went ahead and added this one to my portfolio today. Thinking about adding TXN also. So if my history of losing stock picks continues TXN will shoot to the stars before I get in and ADI will disappear into the pink sheets LOL. I thought it only fair to warn other longs. I think there is a crowd of shorts following my every move!
giving back everything it made yesterday...short sellers in force...buy on rumor and sell on news...wait until we see what the sellside analysts are bad mouthing...
"Why is this tanking after a great report and price target raises? It started out up over $3.00 a share yesterday, and it has been all downhill since then. What gives?"
ADI reached a new 52 Week Low at $80.13
Good opportunity to buy in!!!
Bought more at 115.00
ADI acting as defensive stock at this level..great sign..once tech sell off has been settled this should be back to 90

"If it looks, feel, tastes and smells like mid-summer market churn, it is mid-summer market churn which has the appearance in many sectors and price consolidation which is a price correction against time. Most semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks are range bound and have been for a trading range since late April/Early May 2021 with $TXN, $ADI, $AMAT, $LRCX, $AMD, $KLAC and many others as examples. Enjoy your summer and seek buying opportunities near the lower end of the price range bound from early May onward. There is nothing new here just typical summer market action. The demand for semiconductors will only increase with time and that demand curve doesn't appear linear but rather more exponential."
Analog Devices is up 4.92% to 140.07
"Looking good today. About time too. Good earnings report, good out look, way undervalued.."
Awesome price to begin a position or add to your holdings based on your cost basis.
Anyone ever look at ON Semiconductor?
$100 before ER
Back to $90 in time for the close?
Is this good short now....
"Conf. Call basically stated for the next 2 quarters there will be no momentum of revenue growth. So ADI's bet is on 5G picking up in US and other emerging markets at coming Q. Issue is if global economic slowing down due to trade war, it will also drag future corp investment world wide. My view is even US & China w 1st phase agreement reached by yr end, next phase will be very difficult as gaps in between both countries is wider."
ADI is down 9.97% to 89.84
"FYI: Maxim mentions its “pending” merger with ADI on or before its July 27 earnings report. Maybe not a lock, but the finalization of this deal appears to be looking good."
Looking for an entry but wondering if I should wait for this to settle. What are your thoughts?
"Friends I honestly feel AVGO will step in and own Analog Devices. Company has SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much going on and in development with their Sensor technologies, Driverless cars and Machine Automation. ADI is trading at a major discount to it's peers and IS THE BEST IN CLASS!! Their I said it. Watch AVGO-Broadcom step away from Qcom and buy ADI. I see a bid coming in at low $100's Starting at $120 and being bought at $128 to close it!!! Good luck this one is easy!!"
Regained 50 DMA nicely and even more call buying exp. March...

"Was it Merill or Goldman that recently gave ADI a mid $90's price target?? Goldman did the same with CGNX and it went from $79 to currently $93, in a month to month and halfs time. We are seeing the top tech explosion occuriing, many new improvements and changes coming for our lives! Peace"
"again blood bath, whats happening, its such a good ticket to buy and short sellers have made it reached below its low value, whats happening?"
ADI is down 4.94% to 105.40
Potential 8.2 billion revenue increase expected sounds good to me. In.
long for 94 before Chrismas
What is happening? Why is it dropping today??
Another buyout by ADI. Makin moves.
is the 2 billion dollar repurchase of common stock by ADI board a good sign ?
"not sure where sites like yahoo get their financial data. like most sites, yahoo shows Eps of 2.07 yet adi 2016 anual report shows 2.76. why the difference. based on actual qtr results for 2017, EPS for year will is 5.68 per share. If and when financial services show these actual results, adi will trade from 96 to 100 per share."

Ok gross margin of 70% ...let me put it in TSLA context ...that's 7 to 10times more profitable then TSLA and all those EV cars need ADI Chips for batteries and electronics to function.
Should I buy ADI or XLNX? Don’t say both

"Decent results, not inconsistent with those of TXN although TXN got a boost after they reported. On adjusted EPS, ADI is at 20X TTM EPS while TXN is at 25X.. as much as I like TXN as a company, I think once we get past this softness, ADI has better growth opportunities at a better valuation."
ADI reached an all time high at 104.63
ADI reached an all time high at 126.41
"Stupid to short this ticket, bad brokers."
I think it dropped because they were not excited enough about the new Apple phone release.Avgo mentioned in their conference call that their revenues from the new phone would be in 4Q.Rarely does a company provide guide two quarters out...
it will be longer than that till we see it at $90.
Need a knockout 1st qtr report in Feb and a nice divi increase.
ADI YTD increases only 23.9%. It is not high at all. The pull-back is stupid. I believe it has more room to run.
A split soon wouldn't be the worst thing for this stock.
Analog Devices is down 4.90% to 97.42
"42 billion in market cap for the ""growth semi company"" declining revenue at the end of a expansionary business cycle. 6 billion in rev. 1 billion in cash and over 6 billion in debt. A bunch of ""good will"" from the acquisition. And of course a terrible earnings report, but hey buy back more stock and boost the price."
"OK I see TXN who is the ANALOG business seeking to get into Driverless and rest of auto bus. which ADI has, these two are primed to break out. TXN has been very quiet and ADI is slowly creeping up. Let's see what happens."
ADI numbers are very solid: Looking for $120 target!

"I have been trading for many years. Made a killing on Fitbit, Facebook and LinkedIn. I just went in this morning around 89 and do not have any doubt, not even 1% that this will hit 100 within 2 months. Very very strong, one of strongest stocks I have seen in a amazing positon with recent acquisition. You are just seeing some of that payout but will reap HUGE profits. This has nothing but upside. Can see 200$ by year end even. I am telling you, have not seen a stock this strong and such a great dividend. Guessing tomorrow will even see it hit 90 again. No doubt, amazing stock and I would buy up to 95."
"nice earning, just got 50 call at 97.50."
eventually bulls will win like every day recently

these were stocks options apparently hold for many years
when are we reporting earnings
Great earnings and several analyst upgrades recently. So why is it down today?
A sudden dip of $1 per share. Never be that overwhelming for a rise.
Any guesses on what the divy raise in Feb will be ?
Jeez! Look at the chart. It’s a bubble. Going down
"TXN Teas Instruments has been somewhat quiet , perhaps they are ready ;)"

Took some profits after earnings. When stock was down to $86 bought some calls and it down the drain now.I should have seen the press release carefully. Lots of adjustments to arrive at some magic non-GAAP number of EPS $1.01 or whatever. Looks like many equity research shops are staying neutral. My risk is limited (calls 82.5 and/or 85). Looking to exit sooner or later.

Why do we have such a bad start today?
"Another crazy day, i saw a strong bounce at 83.99. Should the target be met there, brokers?"
jump back in now otherwise you will be too late!!!
"I am thru with this one, runs up and reports strong numbers and raised future numbers and tanks?? This is a stable Air craft carrier in t his space about to dominate the sensor market and the street treats it like this? Of the 8 Analyst ratings that came out after the numbers, all raised the price target with 80% of the big houses seeking $105 plus in price target raises and the shares go down?? This one proves itself each earnings report with beats and raises. This time the mentioned a large paydown of debt that has to be received with open arms?? What the hell is going on here, the houses all raised their price targets and you know they were adding to their holding before these came out. There is total uncertainty with Qcom and Broadcom which only can be pointing at the next best performer if not for Broadcom then intel to bolster their Auto chip business with Mobleye and the steady strength and future potential of the Sensor market with ADI. Texas Instruments and their foray into the driverless and sensor and Analog business, a TXN-ADI tie-up makes total sense in the consolifation phase of the chip sector??"
Wondering about TXN's desire to grow Analog sales and entry to further get into auto sector= Could they step up and make a bid for ADI? Not to mention I know P Maphily who has been dead on is touting the sensor market and Analog's grip on this area going forward. He mentioned ADI an easy double from here.
"Adi is our strong semiconductor manufacturer here in the states. They recently acquired MXIM who solely manufacture semiconductors for EV automakers. This will make them a top player, still not as big as TSM, but there’s plenty of room for growth in this field."

Did you ADIs see the IPNFF boom today. The NFL alumni association President said IPNFF is the leader in Fan Engagement. They are also a Microsoft partner & starting to boom today.
Currently trading at approximately 16.7 PE when using YR18 earnings estimates...inexpensive considering growth pipeline through 2020...
"This is a prime example of ""playing the game"" and shows how easily the stock market is manipulated. Still, with an initial pop ADI had after earnings one had to expect some profit taking, because it nearly always happens with stocks that pop up really high immediately after earnings. Give it a day or two and it will settle and start to rise again"
This stock is at best a $40 stock. Come back in 2020 and prove me wrong

drop everyday ever since that the bloody awesome earning
"Wow what does this company have to do for recognition? Invent fire or the light bulb, gasoline perhaps! This is ridiculous that this company is trading around 19 times earnings??? Really And guiding well past current estimates for the next quarter. This should be a $100/ share company merely on their sustained growth and increasing revenues and earnings estimates. Most of their strength is attributed to the automotive sector, seems somewhat comparable to NVIDIA's recent growth spurt that sent them sustained past $160. I think someone needs to dig in and see the gold this company has uncovered in its markets> $100 plus soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
why does Yahoo show eps of 2.07. Looks like EPS for 2017 is approx 5.61 which makes a PE of about 14.

I believe the institutional brokers are shorting ADI and then pull it back to another surge. This ticket is really something underestimated.
"Profit taking , that's why ADI is down. Just wait until the synergistic effect to take action with the Linear acquisition which diversifies ADI product portfolio."
"insider ownership, 0.55%. institutional ownership 88.72%. these big playersare manipulating the price, they are shorting it down and then have another large buy at the bottom. then another upgoing surge. the lesson i learnt is don't touch the popular tickets held by these ??cking big guys"

"Merger of ADI - MXIM: Got a proxy vote for the merger, dilution of shareholder equity by some 30% and voted my 2000 shares against this merger. Would recommend other owners to do the same - MXIM brings nothing new to ADI unlike LLTC which had a strong power franchise. LLTC despite its top notch power franchise has taken ~ 4 years to begin paying off. If MXIM had a HV power .. it might have got interesting as it could play into the EV power market. At best MXIM is a # 3 in their markets anywhere. ADI has a tendency of overpaying for revenue and MXIM is an example - Let's not dilute our ownership of ADI and send a message to Vincent Roche & Co that the owners don't like the company going for bad acquisitions. Vote NO to increase # of shares."

"gunna try and get in at 77.9 tomorrow before the ex div. I think this stock is evidence of overvalue in the market as a whole. This particular security is undervalued at 78, but the overvalue in the market as a whole affects all corporate securities as it becomes hard to find buyers at prices the sellers are willing to lessen positions at. Be prepared to sell off soon."
sold some garbage to buy more ADI!
ADI is up 4.90% to 92.00
"Guys I have a gut feeling Intel may be agresive with ADI's automotive arm and machine automation division, We'll see ? Good luck longs I like this CO!!!"
"when $MXIM was acquired by $ADI, $ADI's price dropped a bit.could the same be happening to $RNECY as it acquired $DLGNF?any thoughts?"
"Great stock to own . great exposure to 5G, EV, AI and more. got it at 117 few months ago and today 158. it also pay dividends."
Solid results! Great company and attractive valuation.
Will likely run into earnings but don't be shocked for a decent sell off afterwards. Seems to always happen with high performing stocks.
ADI ........Great long and short term play
BUY and HOLD just have to do it sometimes

"OK lets see if my order got filled, I'm thinking way over sold IF nothing else. I'm a Analog man if something goes wrong in this digital world. I have to ask some smart A _ _ 10 yr old kid what to do."
I am confused. No idea what prompted this drop.
