What's the status of the merger with Maxim? Thought it would settle in July.
"based on lat 4 qtrs I show $4.61 eps which PE of 18.7. factoring in growth and PE of 25, seems $145 share price is reasonable. Bonus 2% divi. I am long and buying more."
Held crucial support levels… Now small call buying has begun with March expiration… Just another sign this thing has bottomed.
10% buyback is a big deal.
ADI hits new high at $175.25!
"Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI)Annual Report Available on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0000006281-19-000144/"
"FYI: Maxim mentions its “pending” merger with ADI on or before its July 27 earnings report. Maybe not a lock, but the finalization of this deal appears to be looking good."
why this stock is down despite of excellent results?
"Great stock to own . great exposure to 5G, EV, AI and more. got it at 117 few months ago and today 158. it also pay dividends."
"again blood bath, whats happening, its such a good ticket to buy and short sellers have made it reached below its low value, whats happening?"
"If it looks, feel, tastes and smells like mid-summer market churn, it is mid-summer market churn which has the appearance in many sectors and price consolidation which is a price correction against time. Most semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks are range bound and have been for a trading range since late April/Early May 2021 with $TXN, $ADI, $AMAT, $LRCX, $AMD, $KLAC and many others as examples. Enjoy your summer and seek buying opportunities near the lower end of the price range bound from early May onward. There is nothing new here just typical summer market action. The demand for semiconductors will only increase with time and that demand curve doesn't appear linear but rather more exponential."
Earnings beat and good guidance :)
ADI reached a new 52 Week High at 96.92
"Friends I honestly feel AVGO will step in and own Analog Devices. Company has SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much going on and in development with their Sensor technologies, Driverless cars and Machine Automation. ADI is trading at a major discount to it's peers and IS THE BEST IN CLASS!! Their I said it. Watch AVGO-Broadcom step away from Qcom and buy ADI. I see a bid coming in at low $100's Starting at $120 and being bought at $128 to close it!!! Good luck this one is easy!!"
I think this week will be a good week for ADI to report earnings and hoping all goes well .. 94.79 to 100 ?
Don’t forget MXIM at a discount and being bought by ADI
Why so many form 4 submissions today?
"sensors are going to dominate in the future. autonomous cars, robots, drones, smart devices, all rely upon sensors. this is an absolute gem."
Buy this dip !
Huge buying opportunity!!!
Awesome price to begin a position or add to your holdings based on your cost basis.
Anyone catch the interview David Faber(CNBC) had with Vincent Roache (CEO ADI) WOW. ADI is in all the rightspots when it comes to 5G & 5G related industries & EV battery mgmt. Looks to be a long Runway with thembring on the merger with Maxim
"A beat, a raise, and the Maxim deal is looking good. ADI is firing on all cylinders right now."
"do not worry, adi is solid as a rock. whole sector is down but only temporarily. I am long and will sleep well knowing it will rebound soon and I will get a dividend increase to boot!"
Ok gross margin of 70% ...let me put it in TSLA context ...that's 7 to 10times more profitable then TSLA and all those EV cars need ADI Chips for batteries and electronics to function.
Why do we have such a bad start today?
"Bros, I get trapped at 92.8 and finally out at 95.5. It's really a good ticket. But the two month' experience is really tough. I will be back when it goes down."
Analog Devices $ADI and Maxim Integrated $MXIM Merger - Acquisition News and Eventshttps://mergerarbitragelimited.com/analog-devices-adi-and-maxim-integrated-mxim-merger/
"Merger of ADI - MXIM: Got a proxy vote for the merger, dilution of shareholder equity by some 30% and voted my 2000 shares against this merger. Would recommend other owners to do the same - MXIM brings nothing new to ADI unlike LLTC which had a strong power franchise. LLTC despite its top notch power franchise has taken ~ 4 years to begin paying off. If MXIM had a HV power .. it might have got interesting as it could play into the EV power market. At best MXIM is a # 3 in their markets anywhere. ADI has a tendency of overpaying for revenue and MXIM is an example - Let's not dilute our ownership of ADI and send a message to Vincent Roche & Co that the owners don't like the company going for bad acquisitions. Vote NO to increase # of shares."
"Did anyone realize here ..all those chip shortage for ford , GM etc due to supply issue of these kind of companies. They are priotizing EV supply chips. Anyway earnings tommorow ,GLTA I am expecting a blow out roof top."

ADI numbers are very solid: Looking for $120 target!
This was recommended as one of the top five tech stocks for 2021.
whats with the beatdown?
"Decent results, not inconsistent with those of TXN although TXN got a boost after they reported. On adjusted EPS, ADI is at 20X TTM EPS while TXN is at 25X.. as much as I like TXN as a company, I think once we get past this softness, ADI has better growth opportunities at a better valuation."
Potential 8.2 billion revenue increase expected sounds good to me. In.
