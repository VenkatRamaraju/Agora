"Many here are unhappy with management and for good reason...now an unfavorable patent ruling added to the mix asshare price continues to erode...UBS set a price target of 112 with their ""sell"" rating yesterday, as perhaps they had wind of the SteadyMed/UTHR patent ruling involving Trevyent...this group (mostly Rothblatt) can't seem to get anything done right anymore to enhance shareholder value...when was the last time there was flat out RELEVANT ""good"" news ? Maybe they'll appeal or maybe not; all I know is lately their batting average has been poor, and given this lousy performance the Exec comp packages should rightly be deferred or done away with completely unless/until the ship is righted for shareholders...or as many here suggest SELL the company to a willing buyer at a good price before something else gets screwed up..."

"Liquidia Receives Favorable Ruling in Inter Partes Review against United Therapeutics PatentMentioned: LQDALiquidia Corporation (NASDAQ: LQDA) announced today that the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruled in its favor in the Inter Partes Review (IPR) proceeding against U.S. Patent No. 9,604,901 ('901 patent) owned by United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) and listed in the Orange Book for Tyvaso(R) (treprostinil inhalation solution).In its ruling, the PTAB found that seven of the nine claims were unpatentable. Only the narrower dependent claims 6 and 7 remain, both of which require actual storage at ambient temperature of treprostinil sodium. The PTAB's decision primarily relates to the issue of patentability based on a review of prior art. This decision does not preclude the invalidation of the remaining claims on other grounds as part of the ongoing Hatch Waxman litigation, nor does it mean that Liquidia infringes either of the surviving claims."

Go guys! I think this is lifting all biotech stocks. Up with IMGN and GNCA too. Both been heavily manipulated lately.
"Magic Formula You may be familiar with Joel Greenblatt's magic formula and the thought of high quality / low price may have led you to UTHR. Once at UTHR you may have also been pleasantly surprised to find that UTHR has it's own magic formula, it's budget algorithm, where next year's expenses are budgeted at half last years sales. So it's a magic formula with a magic formula! It is very easy to underestimate the value of UTHR's simple budget algorithm because it's such an unusual practice with Biotechs. But the proof of having the discipline to focus on your best ideas over time is beyond obvious: a incredible pipeline of phase 3 assets, a runway into the future with organ manufacturing, and a very profitable business that self funds it all. Over the next 5 year as these assets progress from phase 3 to NDA / SNDA the formula assures a gusher of profitable growth, nearly 1 to 1 with sales growth. Kudos to the UTHR Team!"

"Market obviously not thrilled with UTHRs part in this deal. They apparently give 50 M up front w/out any assurance anything goes to market and makes even a penny. Then they assume all regulatory and commercial hassle and risk while further guaranteeing MK juicy double digit royalty rates in the event things are able to move forward. Then they give another 10 M upfront for what sounds like just a research effort on the part of MK to possibly develop other products that might never get developed, and if they do guarantee them more juicy royalties...UTHR has just bailed this company out, given up 60 M upfront, and has no assurance anything will ever make a penny for them...no wonder MK is up 40-60% today and UTHR is getting hammered...the current UTHR management/board debacle for long term UTHR shareholders continues..."
"MNKD has amassed a CF pipeline to be reckoned with! Tyvaso DPI is a $1.5Billion sales venture with current approvals, not including future expansion. Remember that 12% royalties about the start coming to #MNKD is based on gross, not net, from $UTHR."
Great numbers.I can't stop laughing...I can't stop laughing...
Cmon Martine before some activist hedgie realizes what you have known all along -mnkd is a little gem that has no clue re marketing this incredible advance in diabetic protocol- you can borrow at 0 interest and if the street knew you were making the obvious move mnkd would pop to $10-We all know who is allied against them but we also know as you do I am sure that inhaled is the future and the needle will be obsolete within a few years-further if you move the pr will be enormous something that mnkd again is clueless about- sadly don't think they even have a pr person on payroll-You are like Dr Mann a big plus in getting the word out-look they still are around even with all mgt negatives and big pharma allied against them-the reason THE PRODUCT-make your move !!!

Are we getting closer to a buy-out?
Predicting bio and health stocks up big over next year.
"Next quarter! Mannkind will be receiving $ from United Therapeudics for royalties on Tyvaso DPI.Even sooner, #MNKD will be receiving $ from $UTHR for reimbursement for manufacturing Tyvaso DPI.$MNKD = cash cow!#UTHR = golden goose."
Vote them out...sh price drop has gone on without respite for years now and in a supposedly stronger market...this current group has proven incapable of delivering share holder value while continuing to rape the coffers for their own exec comp benefits...instead of selling the company at a decent price they buy basically in-house tech with Trevyent and send its sh price skyrocketing while UTHR continues to drop...
This is still small enough to be a takeout target at a 35% premium to todays close. I’m buying more at this decreased levels. Hold this one long term and you’ll double your money in 3-5 years if we don’t see a buyout before that.

What are peoples' opinions on the TreT work with MNKD?
United Therapeutics reached a 52 Week high at 145.71
"“Identify the corridors of indifference and run like hell down them.”Wow annual meeting really leaves a lot to be desired. UTHR holds the meeting on a Friday and only allots 30 minutes or so to the meeting. Shareholders are able to ask one question, however, since the meeting is only 30 minutes just two shareholder questions were answered. No kidding, just two questions, one on Tyvaso and one on diversity and then the meeting was over.In addition, it appeared that just two outside board members attended the meeting. (Only, two outside board members were introduced.) Hard to believe that an engaged board would allow a 30 minute meeting with just two questions. A company who prides itself on identifying the corridors of indifference, appears to be indifferent to shareholders."

UTHR is down 7.46% to 104.44
United Therapeutics reached a 52 Week high at 156.00
What’s up with the sell off? Just a reaction to some insider sales?
UTHR is down 4.93% to 95.54
Good to see another buy back.
Quick! SOMEBODY take my stock! PLEASE!!! ROFLMAO!!!
MNKD' decades old technosphere dpi platform's failure is shown in prescriptions of the only drug they have.2021 is the seventh year of afrezza and for the week ending May 28 they sold only 320 prescriptions in USA. They had No sales in Brazil since 2Q20 and they have so little expectations for it they gave it away to Australia years ago for No upfront money.

not sure why the down movement. but lots of drug/biotech companies have tons of cash to buy.
"UTHR now down to 138 due to ""underperform"" Suisse Credit initial rating....this after dropping from 167 to 148 on revenues miss 3 weeks ago. This is getting old. None of Rothblatt's future oriented pies in the sky are producing shareholder value; and continuing with their obscenely undeserved exec comp packages (further eroding shareholder value) in the face of these already poor shareholder value results for so long is untenable...generic competition, can't get the pump approved, etc. etc...perhaps its time for her to sell the company at a decent price and at least do something to recoup some value for shareholders..."

Mnkd: a non-factor in massive diabetes space. Will be a non-factor in saturated pah space .Far better and newer DPI tech. available that are more successful than stone age technosphere. $UTHR
United Therapeutics reached a 52 Week high at 158.82
"Something to ponder. $UTHR has a treprostinil pill. So do generic pharma's . Pah space filled with generic and brand name drugs already . UTHR has lost plenty of treprostinil patent lawsuits. UTHR's future is with their over $1,200,000,000 oral ralinepeg and the cutting edge transdermal pah technology from a private pharma they bought a stake in. They know how old mnkd tech is and how terrible rx scripts are for the only drug that has used technosphere in 28 years."
UTHR down nearly 10% today on heavy volume after investors not happy about $45million thrown away in $MNKD partnership
Earnings projected at $13 per share for year...at $10/share this should be $130..why $113? This sell off is way overdone. This stock was just at $126 last week...to go down 10% on a good earnings reports is BS..it shows how the market is being manipulated. This stock will be $120 soon after the dust settles.

"It would make sense for UTHR to buy STDY for their treprostinil PatchPump Trevyent product for a much more effective means of treprostinil injection. They could buy them for around $100-$150 million and would at least double Remodulin sales from $545M to $1B as UTHR is currentlt only covering 10% of the PAH market due to it's unpleasentness, which Trevyent would inprove."

"UTHR should bid ARNA if they can afford them. ARNA has the next big drug for PAH, better than any drug UTHR owns and better than the drug CELG paid billions to acquire. They can buy ARNA sell off the other drugs and get ARNA fairly cheap. IMO/not individual investor advice."

What is likely. $UTHR could easily buy this company and maximize their profits
expecting a buy out for MNKD soon...
UTHR reached a 52 Week low at 78.60
UTHR is up 5.67% to 82.49
I guess i will have to Hold for now... what a dissapointment
The biotechs really liked Trump's message on limiting FDA regulation and approval process. Most are on fire premarket! UTHR should at minimum catch the tailwinds!
Big beat on both earnings and revenue.
Shorts covering. Watch 153 area resistance
Stock diving fast today as Trump rally continues.
United Therapeutics lost $50 million off it's market cap today. No coincidence that this is nearly the same amount $UTHR paid MNKD for the partnership. Looks like the market not happy with this partnership after researching how poorly MNKD has performed to date.
"Innovation vs Exploitation This is the second year in a row that shareholders of UTHR have voted no on the say on pay plan for NEOs. It seems foolhardy to risk the reputation of the company and CEO as a great innovator by coming up with new and inventive ways to set compensation records when the company's patient base and revenue over the last two years has contracted. The combination of record setting NEO pay enabled by an annual 6 digit prescription drug price to a relatively small and very vulnerable patient base could draw media attention that focuses coverage on exploitation vs innovation. Can you imagine Dr. R’s picture / pay graphic of $45 million vs a PAH patient picture / prescription price of $185,000 annually? Yikes! In one of the conference calls with analysts I heard UTHR jokingly say its stock symbol stood for “under the radar”. Perhaps this is good advice for the compensation committee. Best to stay “under the radar” with the comp plan."
"Soon, Mannkind will be receiving $ from United Therapeudics for royalties on Tyvaso DPI.Even sooner, #MNKD will be receiving $ from $UTHR for reimbursement for manufacturing Tyvaso DPI.$MNKD = cash cow!#UTHR = golden goose."

"Hedge funds perhaps dropping shares, however hedge funds have been really underperformers for years now with a very small exception. The innovations that this company is doing is mind bogging given the fact they are so small - great team and great vision. This is a tough field, but innovation is key. Bigger pharma companies loose this perspective often with size, this is why they buy up smaller companies. This is a buyout candidate if I ever seen one, low market cap, very innovative and progressive. Infusing cash into this company would be a big forward thinking move. Instead of taking a decade to move these products being worked on, it would be possible to move the needle in years to get them into FDA for approval processes. Especially organ replacement such as lungs. COPD and all other lung diseases cost a very large amount of money just in treatment, productive life time abilities - it's just a no brainer. These are eventual cures which a lot of pharma companies really don't want because they can keep people on drugs that treat symptoms as appose to cures, but on a global scale these cures could be just as lucrative. Eventually these are the elements that are going to happen, because the systematic greed of treating symptoms as apposed to cures will come back to bite these companies, and it already is - slowly albeit it will speed up. Governments and insurers will not put up with much longer. The ultimate winners will be companies like this."

"Certain things have become crystal clear. One is that this management team, as well as the board, has failed shareholders big time. Rothblatt alone is not capable of effectively managing the company, and this has been proven over time, especially since her role increased since certain key execs left the company. Their history of hugely excessive exec compensation packages and corporate costs (reiterated during the last quarter's report) exacerbating poor or mediocre earnings reports, further driving down share holder value, continues unabated. There have never been dividends, only a 2 for 1 share distribution many years ago. They have failed to assertively pursue buyout offers that would be beneficial to shareholders. Rather, they appear to be raping the company more brazenly as they reach closer to retirement age. They need to go, all of them. Cast your votes accordingly."
