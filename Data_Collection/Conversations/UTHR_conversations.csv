Mnkd: a non-factor in massive diabetes space. Will be a non-factor in saturated pah space .Far better and newer DPI tech. available that are more successful than stone age technosphere. $UTHR
"$MNKD will receive from #UTHR double-digit royalty payments for multiple PAH indications using Tyvaso DPI. Those indications will likely deliver double-digit royalty payments for years to come from potential revenues between $1.5 - $3 billion. It's not if Mannkind will thrive with it's partnership with $UTHR, it's how much will it thrive."

"Why to buy $MNKD - Reason #75 - $UTHR Expanded Sales Force.""""With this approval [Tyvaso-April 2021] representing such a breakthrough for PH-ILD patients, we're treating this indication launch with a sense of urgency,"" said Michael Benkowitz, President and Chief Operating Officer of United Therapeutics. ""We've already expanded our field-based teams by 40% to educate the ILD community on the benefits of Tyvaso and how to properly diagnose PH-ILD. We expect rapid uptake of Tyvaso in this indication and expect to double the number of patients on Tyvaso therapy by the end of 2022, barring any COVID-related delays."""
"Keep in mind that $uthr has a substantial record of losing or settling treprostinil patent challenges. Sandoz is just one example. LQDA is paired up with Sandoz, a division of NVS. $mnkd behind the eight ball."

Last 5 days short volume percent - 57.3% Last 10 days short volume percent- 62.04Last 20 days short volume percent - 60.61% Last 50 days short volume - 59.69%Significantly greater number of investors DON'T buy into the $MNKD story. They know $UTHR is counting on ralinepag for the future of pah.
"Here are reasons to short $MNKD : •They paid $12.8M to a Dr. and hired this Dr. who was working on a 70 year old drug in his barn, which most of the time, clofazimine causes a change in the color of the skin to an orange-pink to brown-black color, It takes several months or years to go back to normal after stopping. •Tyvaso DPI $UTHR Not approved now will depend on technosphere, a decades old system that's proven to be a failure in drug delivery for the only drug the system is being used in now Afrezza, the biggest drug flop in history • Tyvaso DPI is just generic treprostinil that's 22 years old and is already sold in oral, inhalation, iv/im formulas as generic drug "
"Liquidia Receives Favorable Ruling in Inter Partes Review against United Therapeutics PatentMentioned: LQDALiquidia Corporation (NASDAQ: LQDA) announced today that the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruled in its favor in the Inter Partes Review (IPR) proceeding against U.S. Patent No. 9,604,901 ('901 patent) owned by United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) and listed in the Orange Book for Tyvaso(R) (treprostinil inhalation solution).In its ruling, the PTAB found that seven of the nine claims were unpatentable. Only the narrower dependent claims 6 and 7 remain, both of which require actual storage at ambient temperature of treprostinil sodium. The PTAB's decision primarily relates to the issue of patentability based on a review of prior art. This decision does not preclude the invalidation of the remaining claims on other grounds as part of the ongoing Hatch Waxman litigation, nor does it mean that Liquidia infringes either of the surviving claims."
"Something to ponder. $UTHR has a treprostinil pill. So do generic pharma's . Pah space filled with generic and brand name drugs already . UTHR has lost plenty of treprostinil patent lawsuits. UTHR's future is with their over $1,200,000,000 oral ralinepeg and the cutting edge transdermal pah technology from a private pharma they bought a stake in. They know how old mnkd tech is and how terrible rx scripts are for the only drug that has used technosphere in 28 years."
soooooo 2 years from now uthr PE going to be about what..... -4?
Ponder this. #mnkd $mnkd has failed to deliver BluHale year after year since 2016. Two years before uthr gave them chicken feed for world wide rights to mnkd generic treprostinil . It was an accessory for affrezza DPI inhaler due to it's inadequate dosing troubles. Bluhale actually demonstrates the ineffectiveness of their stone age technosphere system. $UTHR pah hope and money is in their Billion $ collaboration with arena pharma's pah pill.
