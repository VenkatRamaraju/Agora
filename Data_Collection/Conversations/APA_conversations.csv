"The Altus deal is very solid. Dividend is excellent. NG delivery into UK grid is a perfect storm. I find myself wondering about the good fortune of owning APA @ $27 when other shale drillers such as LPI, CPE, Fang, etc. are much more expensive. This stock is a BUY right her below $28 in this environment going into the winter."
"EQT on gas prices and its impact on it:Seeking Alpha: “EQT Corp. expects to collect ~$1.9B in extra cash next year, roughly double the total anticipated for this year, as natural gas prices have surged and some of the company's hedging contracts are set to roll off, CEO Toby Rice says, according to the Wall Street Journal.""This business is capable of returning a tremendous amount of capital to shareholders,"" Rice told today's earnings conference call, foreseeing a ""long-term, structural"" bullish trend in natural gas prices due to underinvestment in fossil fuels.“"
"ok so Oil is taking a breather , and it is still above 80 bucks ...what's the big deal with all these panic stricken investors. APA averaged USD 72 last Q btw. Anyway no issues, if you don't like the vol then sell....it has to move up and take profit too."
"I have no idea what this new business combination means to me an APA stockholder , is it good, bad or how it could affect APA stock price"
what happened to the posters....three outstanding catlalyts...alpine high...suriname and the egypt deal..and of course the obvious is the price of nat gas and oil ....the guys who use to post here 24 7 ...and on oxys boards
With forward PE around 6 and earnings getting revised upward it seems to be a no brainer that the downside will be short lived.
"Guess the last couple days was the ""pull-back"""
"APA reported their Q3 prices, which were solid, especially for N.A. nat gas ($3.70/mmbtu). Alpine High is massively profitable at current gas and NGL prices. The play was written-off because gas was sub-$1.00/mmbtu for years due to lack of gas pipelines. Hello?? $1.00 vs. $3.00 - That kinda makes a huge difference. Capital discipline does not have to be dogmatic. I want APA to add an additional 2 rigs - 1 rig to drill Alpine High (which only kinda keeps production flat in 2022) and hopefully 1 rig for its new Austin Chalk play (where they are only drilling a handful of wells). I am hearing great wells throughout the Austin Chalk. If that all adds up to around $1.8 billion in CAPEX that is not a problem to me. Sure would be up like $0.7B from 2021, but APA is unhedged and its cash flow will be well north of $4B at strip so FCF of over $2B in 2022 with production growth in mid-single digits."
"For those of you who are thinking APA has gotten ahead of itself, just think of what it will be if oil hits 100￼. Just because a stock goes up 10% in a few days does not mean it’s gotten ahead of itself if the fundamentals are what is pushing it. I was thinking about selling at 30, but that is out the window now because oil is so strong and natural gas is even stronger. Going into a winter with short supplies on hand and very little in storage spells nothing but dollar signs. Get on the train it’s leaving the station!￼"
Apache is doing what they have always been good at. Maximizing and monetizing their assets. This may be the beginning of a string of investor maximizing moves. Altus debt should be moving off the books and Alpine High production should be increasing. I can see that dividend back to $1 in 6 months. Waiting on More Suriname news and Egypt production ratification. Apache shares may make a move that will catch up to other oil and gas stocks.
APA falling despite great reports from other oil co. any reason
Whe their egypt deal is re written they will have millions of fertile acres to cultivate..I am hopin that Alpine high and the suriname assets get monetized...we have no idea how much alpine high is worth with nat gas at these levels and projected to stay healthy for years ...it was originally touted as a massive oil field that turned out to be mostly nat gas ...so if it is massive it will bring a big number...their suriname assets are still tbd...either way multi billion dollar tranactions for itty bitty apache...
"Chevron said Friday that it generated the highest free cash flow on record during the third quarter as surging commodities prices and lower operational costs boosted operations.The oil giant beat top- and bottom-line estimates for the period, earning $2.96 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue jumped more than 80% year over year to $44.71 billion."
"I nearly fell out of Lazy Boy tonight. Mad Money came on and Kramer right out of the chute began recommending oils. For 2 years he has called them un-investible except of course, his favorites Chev, Dev. Tonight he admitted it is a great way to stay ahead of inflation by buying these drillers and many others because he NOW feels the price of oil is here to stay for a long time. Welcome to the party Jim! Better late than never."
"as posted on oxy today is a tech day and a relief for the masses of fund managers who have been on autopilot for the past 16 months..most of them just piled into the same tech names and stay at home names and somehow created a new norm of pes 10-15 higher..microsoft crushed it today but still appears to have a 30-33 pe ....greed for % gains motivates fund managers for their bonuses and if tech missed oil and gas would be moving alot fast upward....today microsft went up about 100 billion in market cap...and % gains in tech like the last 16 months will be a big reach microsoft and apple would have to gup over a trillion each in market cap...40$ here is 38 .. fund managers will move more money into segments that can provide big upside %s..its not just dollar moves only ..its %s,micrsosfts beat slowed things a little ..if the tech parade continues expect a slower climb but still upward and healthy %s"
"Anybody care to weigh in with your price projections for APA for: 1) Feb/March 2022; 2) November 2022, and; 3) 2023??IMO - APA is ""one year behind"" some other O&G E&P's - I also have positions in COP, DVN, PXD - principally due to current debt load prohibiting them from enacting share-holder returns (buybacks and/or dividends) comparable to the aforementioned. Even assuming reasonable retracement in current commodity prices from current levels (i.e. $70 WTI) - even without assigning potential future value to Egypt and/or Suriname!! - APA should be able to pay down the lion's share of their existing debt by . . . this time next year?? . . . thereby positioning them to proceed with returns to shareholders that are more comparable with some of the aforementioned, and as a result be valued by the market more comparably (whether you measure it by a pretty standard metric like PE, or price-to-EBITDA). To me, APA remains a ""show me"" story to most analysts, keeping them from increasing their TP beyond pennies at a time; once APA EXECUTES what they SHOULD be able to do (earnings; paying down debt) for a couple of consecutive quarters, don't be surprised to see those $27 target prices increased dramatically. How's that for ""pumping""? :-DAt current share prices, I am NOT selling ANY of my COP, DVN or PXD, BUT I'm likewise not buying more, WHEREAS I AM considering buying more APA (to me, APA has much greater potential for upside in share price). My November 2022 APA price projection - $42; my 2023 APA price projection - $48+.So . . . feel free to tell me that I'm dreaming."
$APA Target Raised by Raymond James Financial Strong-Buy USD 30 » USD 45Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Outperform » Neutral USD 26 » USD 32
$80 oil and $6.00 gas for the next 5 years would make E&Ps a fortune. They would need a bank only as a storehouse of their newfound wealth.
Winter is coming! Crude oil consumption will be rocketing again. Any dip means buying opportunity.
"Altus transaction; dividends on class A to continue whilst $580m debt in Altus deconsolidated. Total APA debt to now test sub $6bn, noting closing in q1 2022. That is, net debt to annual free cash flow will be less than 3 times over coming months. Importantly, at current energy prices, debt to EBITDAX will test less than 1.5 times. This is big."
"I would not be at all surprised if APA sells it’s SURINAME interest to Total. It looks like APA is about to add Capex for new AH exploration and and possible more Capex for increased Permian exploration. APA has large acreage with potential to kickstart new production growth. Spud to 1st oil has been reduced to approximately 43 days. APA is re-inventing itself to become a cash flow machine that has achieved compliance with ESG, far ahead of competition. And current Administration is going to use APA as it’s poster boy for helping alleviate energy shortage. And APA will finance all expansion from Cash Flow. Say hello to the new APA!"
This is a different Alan . Not going to let the virus change my investment approach . Quite happy with APA and see oil going above 90 this winter.
Ex dividend payment pending tomorrow. Stock price will pullback short term due to the payout.
It appears that mergers/takeovers are over. APA's huge acreage is one of the reasons I bt it. It's market cap would be easy for one of the big guys or even a Devon. thoughts?
"With 2 weeks to go, Here is something for the shorts to consider. Last quarter total revenue was 1.782 B. Just using LAST quarters production numbers and using the numbers from the just released supplement, Revenue for Q3 will be over 2 billion. Believe me production will be higher now that the north sea is fully operational, plus a few in Egypt and several in US have been completed. So you can probably add another 5-8% onto the 2 Bil. No wonder I can hear the corks popping as well as the stock. Good luck all."
"October 14, 2021 04:38 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsKeybanc analyst Leo Mariani maintains APA (NASDAQ:APA) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $25 to $27."
"Got my ticket, seat and popcorn lined up and all ready to watch the show next week. Hopefully its an action thriller and not a horror film."
How will the recent merger of the pipelines reduce the debt on the books of APA?
MY Q3 GUESSTIMATE: $2.08 Billion Rev; $1.23 EPS; $600 million FCF.Q4: $2.9 Billion Rev; $1.76 EPS; $1.1 Billion FCF.
Should I stay with APA and MRO?Getting scared
Here is Boss Shorty when he checks his computer only to see APA up again and nearly every trading day of the entire month.
"Many investors are probably not that aware that APA's N.A. production is roughly 1/3 each oil/NGLs/gas. APA has one of the very highest percentages of NGLs, whcih are the strongest commodity! Doubled in last 4 months vs. oil ""only""up 20%. APA's Q4 will be truly monstrous because of its high NGL percentage but also 6,000 BOEs/d of U.K. natural gas when gas prices there are $30/mmbtu - Yes, $30!"
"I really like the Altus deal for APA. Instead of owning 80% of narrow asset they own 20% of a more stable entity. I also like how they will deconsolidate Altus and so we can see the pure impact of E&P without the minority interest impact as well. And incidentally, I really like the high likelihood APA will add a rig to Alpine High in 2022. At current gas/NGL prices Alpine High has the highest IRR in the portfolio. It is all about prices. Of course if you thought gas/propane would be $1.00/mmbtu and $0.50/gallon Alphine High only loses money, but at $4/$1.00 (forget fact it is $5/$1.50 now) Alpine High is the highest IRR. APA likely will add 2 more rigs full time in 2022 - 1 at Alpine High and 1 to keep drilling Austin Chalk in eastern Eagle Ford. CAPEX in 2022 likely goes to $1.8B from $1.2B in 2021. About $250 mm would be inflation plus more drilling due to no more benefit from DUCs. Before anyone criticizes a 50% increase in CAPEX it is the right balance. APA can go from flat oil/down BOEs to 2022 growth in BOEs in mid-dingle digits (a lot of CAPEX in 2022 won't impact production in 1H so keeping same CAPEX in 2023 likely means another mid-single digit increase in BOE). At current prices, APA's cash flow would be well over $2B higher so who cares CAPEX may be $0.6B more. By end of APA net debt would have fallen enough that the majorty of FCF in 2023 will be in dividends and share buy-backs. Its free cash flow yield at current prices is over 30% - Nutty! APA should be $60 now!"
I took my profits and sold 25% of original APA position And used it to short WMB & MRO.I think those two are extended MRO PE on IBD marketsmith shows 526Xlol.They are jacking up crude futures while they sell the underlying energy stocks . Don’t be fooledI’m in APA though for long run Only one I held .
I can easily see oil at 130 or higher next year. So much production has come off line during this pandemic and the current administration has canceled all drill permits for future expansion. Add the inflation rate and a cold winter...This is a perfect storm for oil to go way higher.
"Suriname is dead money for the next 3-4 years. Meanwhile, AH and Midland Basin acreage go from Spud to first sale in 43 days. Almost instant cash!￼."
"APA North Sea gas - In Q2 APA produced 36,769 mmbtu/d (6,128 BOEs/d) which is only 1.5% of total production. But when gas price goes from $8.10/mmbtu in Q2 to now $30/mmbtu that delta is an eye-popping $72 mm of more cash flow for a quarter period! But that is juts a start. You see propane and ethane prices? They have more than doubled since Q2! At current spot prices APA's quarterly free cash flow is MORE THAN DOUBLE its Q2 free cash flow. It is insane! APA should be $50 NOW!"
"Folks, the news today is a real game changer for Apache. My modeling of Apache indicates we could see a possible $10 gain in price in the next 30 days."
Good things happening for shareholders in the oil patch. Suncor increased their div 100% to match 2019 and increased buyback program. Debt reduction and PFCF. Up 8% after reporting last night.. APA is going to cater to shareholders with similar approaches and a crazy amount of FCF!!!
"Man we get a few down days and the trolls show back up saying the sky is falling. These are the same ones who were there when we were 17, 19 22, 25. Keep your eye on the prize. The price of oil may fluctuate a little but remember the trend is your friend. There is little doubt we are going to 90 dollar oil. I believe 40 dollar APA short term."
