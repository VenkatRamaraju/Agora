"Unless you are a day trader just playing for its swings. I will never understand why real investors will buy HSBC as an investment. Just look at what happens today and look back in history for the past decade. It has never reward long term investors. There are just so many better options globally out there, boys and girls."
HSBC is up 4.91% to 22.75
"HSBC has many strengths, sadly a decisive top management is not one of them. In a competitive world with the bankin a misallocation of assets situation (more in non profitable Europe and less in higher margin Far East) it is laughable that the board needs a leisurely twelve months to find a CEO."
real estate sales taking a big hit in hong kong this month. will that affect hsbc earnings?
Does anyone know what the dividend will be for HSBC on the NYSE. Is it .50 again? I can't find anywhere that states this specifically.
"The story is a bit sensationalist, similar to the Panama papers where the people involved in 85% of the documents were not outside the law. HSBC reported as required. The question is, why is there zero action from law enforcement and zero feedback from the same saying “yes it’s fishy, here’s an interim court order freezing the account.” Law enforcement is either ill-equipped or under motivated to “follow the money” as they do in the movies. It probably has something to do with the complexity which is beyond the expertise and education of most agents of governments.What the article implies is that the onus should be on a financial institution to somehow verify, or perhaps have the client verify source of funds to be transferred, which may have taken 20 years to accumulated or been accumulated 20 years ago. How long will non-criminal clients need to retain records to prove funds are above board. Caution must be taken in the erosion of a presumption of innocence. Flame away."
New lows coming. Good for the Chinese who are adding they get to add more cheaper
China have about 50 trillions in real estates… HSBC is one of the larges lender to most developers in China… majority of developers in China are over leverage. Evergrande is first to fall. Who is next? HSBC is most hated bank… no country will bail out HSBC.
People need to relax. Hsbc is down 50% from their 52 week high but so are other bank stocks like C and WFC. Be patient and accumulate because this will slowly creep back to $30. May not seem like much but it’s 50% gain from this price.
HSEA reached a new 52 Week Low at 25.15
How low is this going? 15$? Bankruptcies / bad loans / leveraged to the max / housing payments halted / mortgage crisis 2.0 - what happens to the price when this all impacts HSBC 2-6 months from now?
"$HSBC strong dividend, strong earnings this quarter, billion dollar company not going anywhere but UP. Screaming buy at these levels."
HSBC is down 5.35% to 25.41
Lower price every day
"Be careful with HSBC. Its involvement in the Huawei CFO arrest case creates a risk for the bank, given it generates at least 25% of its profit in Hong Kong alone. The bank's future depends heavily on China. If Beijing isn't happy with the Huawei case outcome, the bank may pay a price."
"The weekly chart is in a downtrend during 2020. When the moving averages turn up, start to buy shares."
HSBC is up 5.40% to 29.30
When the virus started to affect business. The bank regulators in London told all British banks to stop paying dividends. HSBC said they had plenty of money to cover the regular dividend and the year end special dividend. I hope all this money is collecting interest. Any one heard when British banks will begin to pay dividends again?
thought about buying but then I saw the Yahoo automatic post from 4 mos ago saying the price was $29.55 vs. today's $29.13 LOL
HSBC 5% pop today. Hong Kong market +7% the first three trading day after the new security law is implemented.
"What do the initials HSBC mean? New to board, so would like the real answer. In addition I welcome the more creative among you to add your say. LSMFT"
"The Times of London: Analysts said that the insurer was unlikely to receive a seat on HSBC’s board as a result of its increased shareholding. However, there has been speculation that the bank may increase the number of directors from Asia. Currently only three of 15 are from the region. One of them, Laura Cha — chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchange, with close connections to Beijing — is expected to step down from HSBC’s board soon, having served for nine years.Ping An started buying shares in HSBC in 2016 and took its stake above 5 per cent in December 2017, after which it had to publicly disclose its holding and changes. It has suffered a heavy loss on its HSBC’s shares, which have lost nearly 60 per cent of their value in the past two years.Asian investors were said to be angry when HSBC along with other big banks in the UK were ordered to freeze dividends earlier this year to help cope with the financial cost of the pandemic.HSBC has been hit by several difficult issues in recent months, the most recent of which were reports last week of a leak of documents alleging that it along with other banks continued to move money for clients which suspected of engaging in criminal activity.HSBC has also been criticised by US and British politicians for supporting Beijing’s National Security Law to crack down on Hong Kong dissidents and has been attacked by Chinese authorities for its role in the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, finance chief of the Chinese telecoms group Huawei, in December 2018 at Vancouver airport on a warrant from the US.Observers believe that pressure on the bank may lift somewhat after the US election in November and once noise over Ms Meng’s contested extradition dies down, although that may not be for many months."
Anyone know if we are likely to get a dividend paid in November?
So how on earth can HSBC escape the failing China Bond market ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vCzeKUKdPY
"Explain.. HSBC had a dividend holiday for almost 2 years due to govt. policy in the UK for banks to protect capital during Covid. Now the dividend is partially reinstated and HSBC has hoarded billions of pounds Sterling from unpaid dividends which they do not seem to be returning to shareholders as their dividend now is much less than it was before the dividend withdrawal. So, what is this company doing with all that retained capital? I have a big holding in HSBC but I have lost patience with their inept management and will likely sell after the next EX Div date. Does anyone have any reason to suggest that this company will turn around at some point?"
 really. Interesting spike
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DIVIDEND ???
$WIMI $SCHW $HSBC To the moon. I am happy all speculative tickers are tanking this is going good since I bought it.
is hsbc really paying 10 percent dvd???
HSBC should consider spinning off its Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The move could easily lift its share price by 25% with the announcement alone.
Does anyone have information about how much debt exposure HSBC has to Evergrande Group (恒大集团) ?
Why Hsbc had such a huge loss today while other banks up ?
"Very tempting price right now, but I held off because I'm waiting for a new 52 week low!!!"
HSBC will go $5.00 next summer.

why is this stock trending down so much? I don't get it. Earnings are great.

Just finished my 7th phone call and 12chat and 5th email just to try to add wife as a joint account holder and still not done. Are you people having me on? Apart from that I have tried about 40 times to create a new direct savings account and all the time it gives a rejection at the end. I already have a checking account. Is the HSBC management aware of how bad their service is or don't they care anymore?
Wow... Household Finance... a post WW2 success story that devolved into failure thanks to Sam Walton & Herbert Haft (in reverse order)... few know about... all now long gone...
HDBC has basically zero book value. So overleveraged in China. Bank of England will need to eventually bail them out or they will collapse.
"Evergrande has turned out to be another nothing burger. Bond payment for on shore holders with more next week. Off shore holders are on hook for only $50 billion and #reuters reports today that Blackrock (big China pumper), #UBS and #HSBC have actually been buying more of the bonds the past few momths.

Great time to add more. Splendid dividends for the current share price. The dividend was increased from 0.5 to 0.51 as per latest release.

HSBC looks like it is on the edge of rolling off a cliff. All the mal-investment by these criminals being paid millions for destroying the economy is going to send shock-waves around the globe as they implode. The age of mafia finance is coming to an end - the age of BTC has just begun.
HSBC pays a hefty dividend. Seems like a good blue chip for my retirement dividend income portfolio. Where am I going wrong? (I am currently retired and live off of dividend income.)

"From The Standard... "" HSBC (0005) will buy back up to US$2 billion (HK$15.6 billion) of shares by April 20 next year, with Morgan Stanley acting as principal, according to an exchange filing yesterday.The UK-based lender said it has entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary agreement with Morgan Stanley to allow Morgan Stanley, acting as principal, to purchase its ordinary shares up to US$2 billion with the US investment bank simultaneously selling the shares it buys to HSBC.The period, which began yesterday, runs through April 20, 2022.Morgan Stanley will make trading decisions regarding share buyback independently of HSBC.The Standard Channel More>>Any purchases of shares will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange, Aquis Exchange, BATS, Chi-X and/or Turquoise.This came after HSBC reported a 74 percent rise in third-quarter profit. The bank recorded a pre-tax profit of US$5.4 billion for the quarter to September versus US$3.1 billion 12 months earlier.Its Asia business contributed US$3.3 billion to the total pre-tax profits.In other news, The Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation said yesterday it has issued nearly 4 million credit cards in Hong Kong."""
What does it mean by a share buy back. Will that make the share price go up.
Banks do well this Q 
"Missed on earnings because of a huge write down of ""goodwill"". Without the write down, they would have beat on earnings. The biggest concern I have is their China exposure. Most of their revenue comes from its Asian operations and the Corona virus can't be good for that. But it should be a transitory event that will come and go over the next 6 months."
hsbc bk soon. they are losing billions on pm shorts.

"I try to only post intelligent knowledge and here's a warning... HSBC is a China-Investment entity essentially and they have large exposure to Evergrande.""Ashmore Group Plc, a London-based money manager that specializes in buying emerging-market debt, was one of the biggest holders of the company’s bonds with more than $400 million worth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on end of June filings. Rules on how funds disclose their holdings vary in different countries. BlackRock Inc., UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc were also large owners, many of them held by vehicles that focus on riskier emerging market or Asian credits."" -Bloomberg"
"HSBC has a enterprise value of -337 Billion. Their cash is 1.06T. Market cap at the moment is 89 B. If we add the 89 to the 337, we will have 426 Billions. HSBC is 426 Billion cash positive for a market cap of 89 B. As we all know, banks are the opposite to all other companies out there. Their cash is the debt of the others and their debt is our cash accounts at them. Now, out of the 1.06 trillion of HSBC assests (which are loans as I said), is there a valid reason to believe that 426 Billion which represents roughly 40% of their assets are toxic red loans that will never be returned back to the bank? I think that this is exuberant, obsurd and the market will realise it soon."
Great juicy dividends today
HSBC is down 5.83% to 18.58

If any bank creates $ loans out of thin air. Entries on a ledger. And the borrower doesn't pay it back.Has the bank lost anything?I've never heard this question posed or answered.The answer is no. It's all a silly scam. I feel like we are being fooled.
"hsbc,, whose bank account are you going to freeze again on monday?"
900 billon in cash. This ain't going anywhere. Hong Kong is a problem but I see hong Kong getting evacuated by financial houses. Trump won't let Chi-coms be rewarded by the financial power there. I would find another island maybe in Japan and create a new Hong Kong.

"This is the lowest stock price in company history. No dividend. Pledged allegiance to China. China needs this bank with internationally reach. Expect China to give HSBC enough business to keep it open. No bankruptcy. But stock value will stay down as long as it's locked in by China. This will not break out.

I wish they’d just slash the 35k jobs already. It’s bad news every quarter.
down is because of HK?
Time to split into two banks. One in Asia (Hong Kong? Singapore?) and one for the Western world. Give shares to each investor.
stock is rallying into earnings. usually a good sign. jpm and blackstone are not selling. all other banks have surprised to the upside. maybe think about doing covered calls. i bet it breaches 40 by next week

"Money laundering is ubiquitous. If governments really wanted to clamp down on it, they would. It’s easier and politically expedient to blame HSBC and other banks. HSBC should pay the price because their business model is under significant threat; Brexit set the UK up for failure, the Eurozone is hostile to banks, and China promotes their own. HSBC needs a radical pivot to new sources of business; the old ways aren’t working, and haven’t been for some years. But the money laundering story is really a big nothing burger compared with the bank’s true issues."

That brings the group’s stake to 8% from 7.95% previously. BlackRock Inc., the second-biggest holder, currently owns 7.14%."
