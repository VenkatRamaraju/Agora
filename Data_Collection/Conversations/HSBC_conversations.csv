"Its good that they exit USA retail, clearly not much money to be made there for an outsider. They are focusing on their strengths which is global trade and market access. Retail reaaally doesnt use either of these. Leave it to large USA banks to wrestle over"
was big mistake buying this
"These earmings is merely what they should have had on 2020 q1, not an improvement just the expectation. Looking forward to wheter they hit their 2022 goals personally.."
$WIMI $SCHW $HSBC To the moon. I am happy all speculative tickers are tanking this is going good since I bought it.
HSBC is down 5.35% to 25.41
Does anyone have information about how much debt exposure HSBC has to Evergrande Group (恒大集团) ?
"The Times of London: Analysts said that the insurer was unlikely to receive a seat on HSBC’s board as a result of its increased shareholding. However, there has been speculation that the bank may increase the number of directors from Asia. Currently only three of 15 are from the region. One of them, Laura Cha — chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchange, with close connections to Beijing — is expected to step down from HSBC’s board soon, having served for nine years.Ping An started buying shares in HSBC in 2016 and took its stake above 5 per cent in December 2017, after which it had to publicly disclose its holding and changes. It has suffered a heavy loss on its HSBC’s shares, which have lost nearly 60 per cent of their value in the past two years.Asian investors were said to be angry when HSBC along with other big banks in the UK were ordered to freeze dividends earlier this year to help cope with the financial cost of the pandemic.HSBC has been hit by several difficult issues in recent months, the most recent of which were reports last week of a leak of documents alleging that it along with other banks continued to move money for clients which suspected of engaging in criminal activity.HSBC has also been criticised by US and British politicians for supporting Beijing’s National Security Law to crack down on Hong Kong dissidents and has been attacked by Chinese authorities for its role in the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, finance chief of the Chinese telecoms group Huawei, in December 2018 at Vancouver airport on a warrant from the US.Observers believe that pressure on the bank may lift somewhat after the US election in November and once noise over Ms Meng’s contested extradition dies down, although that may not be for many months."
"New here, I see this is a foreign bank . Do you pay a tax to England on the dividends you receive ?"
"Just read on the HSBC website that they could offer a script dividend to all shareholders after years end results in Feb ‘21. It’s a plus. A dividend is not why we invest, but it helps. Missing my £2250 yearly dividend amongst the £2800 from RDSB and many others, but iv made money from investing in better companies like ABBVIE, MICRON, APPLE gradually from September 2019 to gain more growth."

"Hi, i’m new here. Just wanted to ask everybody’s opinion on the analyst’s projected growth rates (85%)??? How on earth is that a reasonable projected growth rate?"
Just bought this yesterday at market open. I'm full of optimism lol!
Wow... Household Finance... a post WW2 success story that devolved into failure thanks to Sam Walton & Herbert Haft (in reverse order)... few know about... all now long gone...
"Is HSBC going anywhere? Or can we hold for the long haul? Is this a blue chip, Boys?"
let's see if people in hk are lining up outside hsbc in hk in an hour
People need to relax. Hsbc is down 50% from their 52 week high but so are other bank stocks like C and WFC. Be patient and accumulate because this will slowly creep back to $30. May not seem like much but it’s 50% gain from this price.
Are we ever going to see this go back up ?
are they going to pay dividend or not for preferred shares? the pay date supposed to be 6/15 can not find any thing about it
0005.HK is up 4.94% to 39.30
79% Profit jump?!?!? that's massive!
Short this on the fundamentals. SELL

So who did hsbc bribe today to make it go green haha
the ax man cometh. need an outsider to do dirty work. this should be good for upcoming earnings. executive high salary positions are on the chopping block
"Way to go HSBC. Very good investment for me, and nice dividend."
"Very tempting price right now, but I held off because I'm waiting for a new 52 week low!!!"
real estate sales taking a big hit in hong kong this month. will that affect hsbc earnings?

short bank stocks or faang?
What’s wrong with this stock ? It can’t seem to stop going down 
HSBC-PA is down 5.11% to 23.75
"Missed on earnings because of a huge write down of ""goodwill"". Without the write down, they would have beat on earnings. The biggest concern I have is their China exposure. Most of their revenue comes from its Asian operations and the Corona virus can't be good for that. But it should be a transitory event that will come and go over the next 6 months."
HSBC is up 4.91% to 22.75
The chart is heading to financial crisis low IMHO

"any business that associates itself with china will go down the drain eventually.. today is hsbc, tomorrow is microsoft"
"today I add some 46,4 .. we will see next weeks"
"People talk of an acquisition.. no bank will acquire hsbc fr over $11 per share.. no bank, not anytime this or next year or the following year"
why is this stock trending down so much? I don't get it. Earnings are great.
looks to me like this bank is about to collaps to near $0. any one have estimate how far this Curroption will drag it down???
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DIVIDEND ???
are we getting dividends this year?
stock is rallying into earnings. usually a good sign. jpm and blackstone are not selling. all other banks have surprised to the upside. maybe think about doing covered calls. i bet it breaches 40 by next week

"Wow, busted twice in 9 years. I suspect they will pay the price this time. They certainly are with their pps. CEO is toast"
HSBC looks like it is on the edge of rolling off a cliff. All the mal-investment by these criminals being paid millions for destroying the economy is going to send shock-waves around the globe as they implode. The age of mafia finance is coming to an end - the age of BTC has just begun.
"Money laundering is ubiquitous. If governments really wanted to clamp down on it, they would. It’s easier and politically expedient to blame HSBC and other banks. HSBC should pay the price because their business model is under significant threat; Brexit set the UK up for failure, the Eurozone is hostile to banks, and China promotes their own. HSBC needs a radical pivot to new sources of business; the old ways aren’t working, and haven’t been for some years. But the money laundering story is really a big nothing burger compared with the bank’s true issues."
"Aside from the outstanding valuation, still well below book, here's another reason the shares have a long way to go- HSBC is still the safest way to get in on China growth."" SINGAPORE: HSBC dumped all its stake in Evergrande early this month, following in the footsteps of TCW, which exited the month before, according to Morningstar. The fund managers are the latest to join a chorus of Evergrande’s bears, including Pimco, Barings, and T. Rowe Price, which have shunned or have significantly cut exposure to Evergrande in their portfolios since mid-last year.

Great time to add more. Splendid dividends for the current share price. The dividend was increased from 0.5 to 0.51 as per latest release.
Hsbc is the super juicy stock that I can find in the market .

Why is this stock down? What’s the story? Any specific cause?
The main holder PingAn should be lose seriously. See what will happen in early Oct.
Quinn is a good CEO. I’m glad he was appointed
"HSBC has a enterprise value of -337 Billion. Their cash is 1.06T. Market cap at the moment is 89 B. If we add the 89 to the 337, we will have 426 Billions. HSBC is 426 Billion cash positive for a market cap of 89 B. As we all know, banks are the opposite to all other companies out there. Their cash is the debt of the others and their debt is our cash accounts at them. Now, out of the 1.06 trillion of HSBC assests (which are loans as I said), is there a valid reason to believe that 426 Billion which represents roughly 40% of their assets are toxic red loans that will never be returned back to the bank? I think that this is exuberant, obsurd and the market will realise it soon."
can someone confirm hsbc atm machines in hk were all blocked from withdrawing money?
"With China trying to cut off its companies from the US… more forcefully now, I was hoping that would profit HSBC…..  hoping"
HSBC will go $5.00 next summer.
This has found support at these levels so far...lets see if it holds.
900 billon in cash. This ain't going anywhere. Hong Kong is a problem but I see hong Kong getting evacuated by financial houses. Trump won't let Chi-coms be rewarded by the financial power there. I would find another island maybe in Japan and create a new Hong Kong.
Share price easily falls below $20 with the Evergrande exposure HSBC has... along with every other Chinese stock in their portfolio declining due to contagion.
"Explain.. HSBC had a dividend holiday for almost 2 years due to govt. policy in the UK for banks to protect capital during Covid. Now the dividend is partially reinstated and HSBC has hoarded billions of pounds Sterling from unpaid dividends which they do not seem to be returning to shareholders as their dividend now is much less than it was before the dividend withdrawal. So, what is this company doing with all that retained capital? I have a big holding in HSBC but I have lost patience with their inept management and will likely sell after the next EX Div date. Does anyone have any reason to suggest that this company will turn around at some point?"
Will it continue to go back up?
are we finished now? monday should be a good sign if bank shares stabilize. hopefully no more sensationalist coverage out of hk

"$HSBC strong dividend, strong earnings this quarter, billion dollar company not going anywhere but UP. Screaming buy at these levels."
HDBC has basically zero book value. So overleveraged in China. Bank of England will need to eventually bail them out or they will collapse.
Profits plummeted
"Some here may remember me, most will not. I expect HSBC to more than double in value over the next 18 months.... $60/share. My opinion. Do your own due diligence."

Apart from that I have tried about 40 times to create a new direct savings account and all the time it gives a rejection at the end. I already have a checking account. Is the HSBC management aware of how bad their service is or don't they care anymore?
Why is this share below $26 when most are positive on this share? Will it’s downward trend continue !

China have about 50 trillions in real estates… HSBC is one of the larges lender to most developers in China… majority of developers in China are over leverage. Evergrande is first to fall. Who is next? HSBC is most hated bank… no country will bail out HSBC.

"HSBC has many strengths, sadly a decisive top management is not one of them. In a competitive world with the bankin a misallocation of assets situation (more in non profitable Europe and less in higher margin Far East) it is laughable that the board needs a leisurely twelve months to find a CEO."
what the he ll happened??

Rules on how funds disclose their holdings vary in different countries. BlackRock Inc., UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc were also large owners, many of them held by vehicles that focus on riskier emerging market or Asian credits."" -Bloomberg"

"Unless you are a day trader just playing for its swings. I will never understand why real investors will buy HSBC as an investment. Just look at what happens today and look back in history for the past decade. It has never reward long term investors. There are just so many better options globally out there, boys and girls."
"The story is a bit sensationalist, similar to the Panama papers where the people involved in 85% of the documents were not outside the law. HSBC reported as required. The question is, why is there zero action from law enforcement and zero feedback from the same saying “yes it’s fishy, here’s an interim court order freezing the account.” Law enforcement is either ill-equipped or under motivated to “follow the money” as they do in the movies. It probably has something to do with the complexity which is beyond the expertise and education of most agents of governments.What the article implies is that the onus should be on a financial institution to somehow verify, or perhaps have the client verify source of funds to be transferred, which may have taken 20 years to accumulated or been accumulated 20 years ago. How long will non-criminal clients need to retain records to prove funds are above board. Caution must be taken in the erosion of a presumption of innocence. Flame away."
How low is this going? 15$? Bankruptcies / bad loans / leveraged to the max / housing payments halted / mortgage crisis 2.0 - what happens to the price when this all impacts HSBC 2-6 months from now?

Does anyone know what the dividend will be for HSBC on the NYSE. Is it .50 again? I can't find anywhere that states this specifically.
wish there was a way to screen conversation from all the chatter trying to get me to use another site tool...
Anyone know if we are likely to get a dividend paid in November?
where is bottom
I wish they’d just slash the 35k jobs already. It’s bad news every quarter.
Good time to buy especially if China trade deal gets sorted
"Be careful with HSBC. Its involvement in the Huawei CFO arrest case creates a risk for the bank, given it generates at least 25% of its profit in Hong Kong alone. The bank's future depends heavily on China. If Beijing isn't happy with the Huawei case outcome, the bank may pay a price."
the game will end badly for HSBC all their crimes are going to catch up to themas China CCP will not take the bribes anymorebecause now it's us or them ....
"35,000 job cuts that could make the company more competitive across many of its divisions. This could help it to successfully overcome what may prove to be a period of lower demand as the world economy experiences reduced levels of GDP growth."

That brings the group’s stake to 8% from 7.95% previously. BlackRock Inc., the second-biggest holder, currently owns 7.14%."
When the virus started to affect business. The bank regulators in London told all British banks to stop paying dividends. HSBC said they had plenty of money to cover the regular dividend and the year end special dividend. I hope all this money is collecting interest. Any one heard when British banks will begin to pay dividends again?
is it safe to keep a regular savings account with hsbc if the US sanctions the bank given Pompeo's recent comments..it's coming
why -4.9% in premarket?
Beat all analysts estimates! First quarter profit increased by 31% YOY. I’m guessing a +10% day tomorrow.

"Atm. Bank of New York is cheaper than HSBC unless HSBC suddenly goes below $17 for the NYSE paper. BK also doesn't have political problems, a large loan book or a looming Brexit. I still hold a 2 % position in HSBC but this is mainly in hopes of a + 10 year turn around and I might double down to 4 % if it goes lower but scaring the shorts ( like yesterday ) is not going to fool me into doubling down too early"

HSBC trading 40% below book value. P/E less than 12. Check Bloomberg for exact numbers.
The right thing to do in this case would be to sell the news and pocket the cash.
HSBC pays a hefty dividend. Seems like a good blue chip for my retirement dividend income portfolio. Where am I going wrong? (I am currently retired and live off of dividend income.)

"If you invest in this company you're supporting drug cartels and the Iranian regime: https://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2013/investing-news-for-jan-29-hsbcs-money-laundering-scandal-hbc-scbff-ing-cs-rbs0129.aspxAlso, their dividend yield is the worst I've ever seen for a bank but maybe I'm spoiled."
HSBC should consider spinning off its Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The move could easily lift its share price by 25% with the announcement alone.

"This is the lowest stock price in company history. No dividend. Pledged allegiance to China. China needs this bank with internationally reach. Expect China to give HSBC enough business to keep it open. No bankruptcy. But stock value will stay down as long as it's locked in by China. This will not break out. Share price could still drop more. Bad loan, 1 bad loan, has already rocked the bank. More will follow. US offices in NY and SF are staffed with blind clowns on unicycles. If they had any brains at all, US lending and investment could carry the bank, and they wouldn't have to give topless backrubs to the communist."
 really. Interesting spike
This bank.is positioned to be China's financial conduit.
