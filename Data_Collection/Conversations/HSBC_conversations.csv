HSBC reached a new 52 Week Low at $39.60
"I'm honestly surprised about how surprised people are about this banking scandal. It has been common knowledge that they've done this for years. Heck, there is even multiple documentaries about it that point out that nothing has been done to fix the issue after getting in trouble for it in the past."
"New 52W low only the start. HK & China properties are going to crash. It's about freedom vs communism in Hong Kong. China will never let HK be free. Musical chairs have stopped. The rich are terrified. Bank run, property crash coming, All renters will stop paying."
If any bank creates $ loans out of thin air. Entries on a ledger. And the borrower doesn't pay it back.Has the bank lost anything?I've never heard this question posed or answered.The answer is no. It's all a silly scam. I feel like we are being fooled.

The us wants too issue sanctions against this company in particular good for a 5% pop. The sec should investigate issue sanctions now
"HSBC has many strengths, sadly a decisive top management is not one of them. In a competitive world with the bankin a misallocation of assets situation (more in non profitable Europe and less in higher margin Far East) it is laughable that the board needs a leisurely twelve months to find a CEO."
It's brilliant that they jacked the div up. Investors would normally flee from Brexit.... but less will hold out a carrot. That's the kind of to the point strategy I like!
HSBC is up 4.91% to 22.75
When the virus started to affect business. The bank regulators in London told all British banks to stop paying dividends. HSBC said they had plenty of money to cover the regular dividend and the year end special dividend. I hope all this money is collecting interest. Any one heard when British banks will begin to pay dividends again?

"Unless you are a day trader just playing for its swings. I will never understand why real investors will buy HSBC as an investment. Just look at what happens today and look back in history for the past decade. It has never reward long term investors. There are just so many better options globally out there, boys and girls."

"China’s Ping An Insurance Group Co. raised its stake in HSBC Holdings Plc, cementing its position as the lender’s biggest shareholder.Ping An Asset Management Co., a unit of the insurer, bought 10.8 million shares of HSBC on Wednesday, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday. That brings the group’s stake to 8% from 7.95% previously. BlackRock Inc., the second-biggest holder, currently owns 7.14%."

Will HSBC still be here long after I'm gone?

"Missed on earnings because of a huge write down of ""goodwill"". Without the write down, they would have beat on earnings. The biggest concern I have is their China exposure.

When are dividends going to announced?
HSBC pays a hefty dividend. Seems like a good blue chip for my retirement dividend income portfolio. Where am I going wrong? (I am currently retired and live off of dividend income.)
Great time to add more. Splendid dividends for the current share price. The dividend was increased from 0.5 to 0.51 as per latest release.
HSBC market cap is 80 Billion - It holds GLD ETF value at 60 Billion. Is this right? If this bank goes under then what happens to all these paper Gold?

was big mistake buying this
What got into HSBC? Up 7%?
"HSBC has a enterprise value of -337 Billion. Their cash is 1.06T. Market cap at the moment is 89 B. If we add the 89 to the 337, we will have 426 Billions. HSBC is 426 Billion cash positive for a market cap of 89 B. As we all know, banks are the opposite to all other companies out there. Their cash is the debt of the others and their debt is our cash accounts at them. Now, out of the 1.06 trillion of HSBC assests (which are loans as I said), is there a valid reason to believe that 426 Billion which represents roughly 40% of their assets are toxic red loans that will never be returned back to the bank? I think that this is exuberant, obsurd and the market will realise it soon."

HSBC should consider spinning off its Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The move could easily lift its share price by 25% with the announcement alone.

"The story is a bit sensationalist, similar to the Panama papers where the people involved in 85% of the documents were not outside the law. HSBC reported as required. The question is, why is there zero action from law enforcement and zero feedback from the same saying “yes it’s fishy, here’s an interim court order freezing the account.” Law enforcement is either ill-equipped or under motivated to “follow the money” as they do in the movies. It probably has something to do with the complexity which is beyond the expertise and education of most agents of governments.What the article implies is that the onus should be on a financial institution to somehow verify, or perhaps have the client verify source of funds to be transferred, which may have taken 20 years to accumulated or been accumulated 20 years ago. How long will non-criminal clients need to retain records to prove funds are above board. Caution must be taken in the erosion of a presumption of innocence. Flame away."

"Is HSBC going anywhere? Or can we hold for the long haul? Is this a blue chip, Boys?"
"Money laundering is ubiquitous. If governments really wanted to clamp down on it, they would. It’s easier and politically expedient to blame HSBC and other banks. HSBC should pay the price because their business model is under significant threat; Brexit set the UK up for failure, the Eurozone is hostile to banks, and China promotes their own. HSBC needs a radical pivot to new sources of business; the old ways aren’t working, and haven’t been for some years. But the money laundering story is really a big nothing burger compared with the bank’s true issues."
strong buy
HSBC will soon bk. the price actions explain it.
"Atm. Bank of New York is cheaper than HSBC unless HSBC suddenly goes below $17 for the NYSE paper. BK also doesn't have political problems, a large loan book or a looming Brexit. I still hold a 2 % position in HSBC but this is mainly in hopes of a + 10 year turn around and I might double down to 4 % if it goes lower but scaring the shorts ( like yesterday ) is not going to fool me into doubling down too early"

"With China trying to cut off its companies from the US… more forcefully now, I was hoping that would profit HSBC…..  hoping"

Wholly Molly what a reversal congrats longs.
This bank.is positioned to be China's financial conduit.
awaiting hsbc to break 1 year high
"This is the lowest stock price in company history. No dividend. Pledged allegiance to China. China needs this bank with internationally reach. Expect China to give HSBC enough business to keep it open. No bankruptcy. But stock value will stay down as long as it's locked in by China. This will not break out. Share price could still drop more. Bad loan, 1 bad loan, has already rocked the bank. More will follow. US offices in NY and SF are staffed with blind clowns on unicycles. If they had any brains at all, US lending and investment could carry the bank, and they wouldn't have to give topless backrubs to the communist."

"Explain.. HSBC had a dividend holiday for almost 2 years due to govt. policy in the UK for banks to protect capital during Covid. Now the dividend is partially reinstated and HSBC has hoarded billions of pounds Sterling from unpaid dividends which they do not seem to be returning to shareholders as their dividend now is much less than it was before the dividend withdrawal. So, what is this company doing with all that retained capital? I have a big holding in HSBC but I have lost patience with their inept management and will likely sell after the next EX Div date. Does anyone have any reason to suggest that this company will turn around at some point?"

"Just read on the HSBC website that they could offer a script dividend to all shareholders after years end results in Feb ‘21. It’s a plus. A dividend is not why we invest, but it helps. Missing my £2250 yearly dividend amongst the £2800 from RDSB and many others, but iv made money from investing in better companies like ABBVIE, MICRON, APPLE gradually from September 2019 to gain more growth."
stock is rallying into earnings. usually a good sign. jpm and blackstone are not selling. all other banks have surprised to the upside. maybe think about doing covered calls. i bet it breaches 40 by next week

"New here, I see this is a foreign bank . Do you pay a tax to England on the dividends you receive ?"
"The Times of London: Analysts said that the insurer was unlikely to receive a seat on HSBC’s board as a result of its increased shareholding. However, there has been speculation that the bank may increase the number of directors from Asia. Currently only three of 15 are from the region. One of them, Laura Cha — chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchange, with close connections to Beijing — is expected to step down from HSBC’s board soon, having served for nine years.Ping An started buying shares in HSBC in 2016 and took its stake above 5 per cent in December 2017, after which it had to publicly disclose its holding and changes. It has suffered a heavy loss on its HSBC’s shares, which have lost nearly 60 per cent of their value in the past two years.Asian investors were said to be angry when HSBC along with other big banks in the UK were ordered to freeze dividends earlier this year to help cope with the financial cost of the pandemic.HSBC has been hit by several difficult issues in recent months, the most recent of which were reports last week of a leak of documents alleging that it along with other banks continued to move money for clients which suspected of engaging in criminal activity.HSBC has also been criticised by US and British politicians for supporting Beijing’s National Security Law to crack down on Hong Kong dissidents and has been attacked by Chinese authorities for its role in the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, finance chief of the Chinese telecoms group Huawei, in December 2018 at Vancouver airport on a warrant from the US.Observers believe that pressure on the bank may lift somewhat after the US election in November and once noise over Ms Meng’s contested extradition dies down, although that may not be for many months."
