HSBC 5% pop today. Hong Kong market +7% the first three trading day after the new security law is implemented.
"Same question, what causes it down $1?"
not good enough
+10% by me
looks to me like this bank is about to collaps to near $0. any one have estimate how far this Curroption will drag it down???
The right thing to do in this case would be to sell the news and pocket the cash.
Profits plummeted
HSBC pays a hefty dividend. Seems like a good blue chip for my retirement dividend income portfolio. Where am I going wrong? (I am currently retired and live off of dividend income.)
How much lower can it go?
"LOCKDOWN, BREXIT, COLLAPSING ECONOMY, TANKING CORPORATE REVENUES and Here we are FTSE 100 (^FTSE) got PUMPED by 10% in 4 trading days!$BP $HSBC."
strong buy
HSBC should consider spinning off its Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The move could easily lift its share price by 25% with the announcement alone.
down is because of HK?
What got into HSBC? Up 7%?
 really. Interesting spike
what just happened? why down over 7% ??
"Be careful with HSBC. Its involvement in the Huawei CFO arrest case creates a risk for the bank, given it generates at least 25% of its profit in Hong Kong alone. The bank's future depends heavily on China. If Beijing isn't happy with the Huawei case outcome, the bank may pay a price."
"HSBC has a enterprise value of -337 Billion. Their cash is 1.06T. Market cap at the moment is 89 B. If we add the 89 to the 337, we will have 426 Billions. HSBC is 426 Billion cash positive for a market cap of 89 B. As we all know, banks are the opposite to all other companies out there. Their cash is the debt of the others and their debt is our cash accounts at them. Now, out of the 1.06 trillion of HSBC assests (which are loans as I said), is there a valid reason to believe that 426 Billion which represents roughly 40% of their assets are toxic red loans that will never be returned back to the bank? I think that this is exuberant, obsurd and the market will realise it soon."
"35,000 job cuts that could make the company more competitive across many of its divisions. This could help it to successfully overcome what may prove to be a period of lower demand as the world economy experiences reduced levels of GDP growth."
"With China trying to cut off its companies from the US… more forcefully now, I was hoping that would profit HSBC…..  hoping"
This has found support at these levels so far...lets see if it holds.
Bagholders say what?
79% Profit jump?!?!? that's massive!
So how on earth can HSBC escape the failing China Bond market ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vCzeKUKdPY
"#HSBC has been showing support at 37.49 and resistance at 39.95. Buy rating: 6.5, according to 9trading."
real estate sales taking a big hit in hong kong this month. will that affect hsbc earnings?
Share price easily falls below $20 with the Evergrande exposure HSBC has... along with every other Chinese stock in their portfolio declining due to contagion.
"Just read on the HSBC website that they could offer a script dividend to all shareholders after years end results in Feb ‘21. It’s a plus. A dividend is not why we invest, but it helps. Missing my £2250 yearly dividend amongst the £2800 from RDSB and many others, but iv made money from investing in better companies like ABBVIE, MICRON, APPLE gradually from September 2019 to gain more growth."
"OOPS, some bad news"
Why is this share below $26 when most are positive on this share? Will it’s downward trend continue !
"The Times of London: Analysts said that the insurer was unlikely to receive a seat on HSBC’s board as a result of its increased shareholding. However, there has been speculation that the bank may increase the number of directors from Asia. Currently only three of 15 are from the region. One of them, Laura Cha — chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchange, with close connections to Beijing — is expected to step down from HSBC’s board soon, having served for nine years.Ping An started buying shares in HSBC in 2016 and took its stake above 5 per cent in December 2017, after which it had to publicly disclose its holding and changes. It has suffered a heavy loss on its HSBC’s shares, which have lost nearly 60 per cent of their value in the past two years.Asian investors were said to be angry when HSBC along with other big banks in the UK were ordered to freeze dividends earlier this year to help cope with the financial cost of the pandemic.HSBC has been hit by several difficult issues in recent months, the most recent of which were reports last week of a leak of documents alleging that it along with other banks continued to move money for clients which suspected of engaging in criminal activity.HSBC has also been criticised by US and British politicians for supporting Beijing’s National Security Law to crack down on Hong Kong dissidents and has been attacked by Chinese authorities for its role in the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, finance chief of the Chinese telecoms group Huawei, in December 2018 at Vancouver airport on a warrant from the US.Observers believe that pressure on the bank may lift somewhat after the US election in November and once noise over Ms Meng’s contested extradition dies down, although that may not be for many months."
"This is the lowest stock price in company history. No dividend. Pledged allegiance to China. China needs this bank with internationally reach. Expect China to give HSBC enough business to keep it open. No bankruptcy. But stock value will stay down as long as it's locked in by China. This will not break out. Share price could still drop more. Bad loan, 1 bad loan, has already rocked the bank. More will follow. US offices in NY and SF are staffed with blind clowns on unicycles. If they had any brains at all, US lending and investment could carry the bank, and they wouldn't have to give topless backrubs to the communist."
one more big down day and I am loading up. will we se 37-38 ?
What’s a reasonable target price for a year to come on HSBC ?
hsbc bk soon. they are losing billions on pm shorts.
"Hi, i’m new here. Just wanted to ask everybody’s opinion on the analyst’s projected growth rates (85%)??? How on earth is that a reasonable projected growth rate?"
I wish they’d just slash the 35k jobs already. It’s bad news every quarter.
Good time to buy especially if China trade deal gets sorted
HSBC looks like it is on the edge of rolling off a cliff. All the mal-investment by these criminals being paid millions for destroying the economy is going to send shock-waves around the globe as they implode. The age of mafia finance is coming to an end - the age of BTC has just begun.
People need to relax. Hsbc is down 50% from their 52 week high but so are other bank stocks like C and WFC. Be patient and accumulate because this will slowly creep back to $30. May not seem like much but it’s 50% gain from this price.
This bank.is positioned to be China's financial conduit.
$20 or below
Will it continue to go back up?
Do you guys think this can recover to $35?
"Some here may remember me, most will not. I expect HSBC to more than double in value over the next 18 months.... $60/share. My opinion. Do your own due diligence."
Beat all analysts estimates! First quarter profit increased by 31% YOY. I’m guessing a +10% day tomorrow.
are we getting dividends this year?
The stock has been called. HSBC will be buying these back at $25 a share.
Wholly Molly what a reversal congrats longs.
Possible dividend reinstatement by April of 5c per quarter!!
"Such a great company, it is hiring new people in Asia.... Growing the thing! Well done guys."
"Aside from the outstanding valuation, still well below book, here's another reason the shares have a long way to go- HSBC is still the safest way to get in on China growth."" SINGAPORE: HSBC dumped all its stake in Evergrande early this month, following in the footsteps of TCW, which exited the month before, according to Morningstar. The fund managers are the latest to join a chorus of Evergrande’s bears, including Pimco, Barings, and T. Rowe Price, which have shunned or have significantly cut exposure to Evergrande in their portfolios since mid-last year.

is hsbc really paying 10 percent dvd???
HSBC reached a new 52 Week High at 54.17
"New here, I see this is a foreign bank . Do you pay a tax to England on the dividends you receive ?"
short bank stocks or faang?
What does it mean by a share buy back. Will that make the share price go up.
buy buy buy!
New lows coming. Good for the Chinese who are adding they get to add more cheaper
HSBC is down 5.83% to 18.58
"Money laundering is ubiquitous. If governments really wanted to clamp down on it, they would. It’s easier and politically expedient to blame HSBC and other banks. HSBC should pay the price because their business model is under significant threat; Brexit set the UK up for failure, the Eurozone is hostile to banks, and China promotes their own. HSBC needs a radical pivot to new sources of business; the old ways aren’t working, and haven’t been for some years. But the money laundering story is really a big nothing burger compared with the bank’s true issues."
With rising interest rates HSBC will earn a lot of money. Will start buy backs later. Earnings should be good. Low pe.
HSBC will go $5.00 next summer.
HSBC reached an all time low at 19.80
"These earmings is merely what they should have had on 2020 q1, not an improvement just the expectation. Looking forward to wheter they hit their 2022 goals personally.."

"You are supposed to put money in a market before the rise, not during the rise. Be a contrarian, not a follower Wilson Taylor always made that clear to his students."
Funded terrorist groups and people here say “buy on the dip”? All I hope is the executives go to prison and the stock goes to zero.
"I take it the downslope is all about Brexit. There were rumors about relocating to Singapore, since most of the business is in Asia. Any thoughts?"
Great time to add more. Splendid dividends for the current share price. The dividend was increased from 0.5 to 0.51 as per latest release.
HSEA reached a new 52 Week Low at 25.15

HDBC has basically zero book value. So overleveraged in China. Bank of England will need to eventually bail them out or they will collapse.

Does anyone know what the dividend will be for HSBC on the NYSE. Is it .50 again? I can't find anywhere that states this specifically.

"HSBC - Profits Plunges, Accelerates 35k Job Cuts"
Bought this back in 2015 around $43... with dividends reinvested I am at about +15%... thinking I sell out of it - take the money and run. Thoughts?
HSBC will soon bk. the price actions explain it.
"Good news for repaying dividends, but how much for half year dividends?"
This will be the next Santander bank. See you at 22
"New 52W low only the start. HK & China properties are going to crash. It's about freedom vs communism in Hong Kong. China will never let HK be free. Musical chairs have stopped. The rich are terrified. Bank run, property crash coming, All renters will stop paying."
HSBC reached a new 52 Week High at 53.90
HSBC market cap is 80 Billion - It holds GLD ETF value at 60 Billion. Is this right? If this bank goes under then what happens to all these paper Gold?
"Missed on earnings because of a huge write down of ""goodwill"". Without the write down, they would have beat on earnings. The biggest concern I have is their China exposure. Most of their revenue comes from its Asian operations and the Corona virus can't be good for that. But it should be a transitory event that will come and go over the next 6 months."
"HSBC has many strengths, sadly a decisive top management is not one of them. In a competitive world with the bankin a misallocation of assets situation (more in non profitable Europe and less in higher margin Far East) it is laughable that the board needs a leisurely twelve months to find a CEO."
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DIVIDEND ???
Dead money
When are dividends going to announced?
Two upgrades today and an imminent short squeeze. It's still early. Added more again .
"$HSBC strong dividend, strong earnings this quarter, billion dollar company not going anywhere but UP. Screaming buy at these levels."

Just finished my 7th phone call and 12chat and 5th email just to try to add wife as a joint account holder and still not done. Are you people having me on? Apart from that I have tried about 40 times to create a new direct savings account and all the time it gives a rejection at the end. I already have a checking account. Is the HSBC management aware of how bad their service is or don't they care anymore?

Great juicy dividends today
AXA a poor buy. Better fish in the sea to catch!

Anyone know if we are likely to get a dividend paid in November?
"I try to only post intelligent knowledge and here's a warning... HSBC is a China-Investment entity essentially and they have large exposure to Evergrande.""Ashmore Group Plc, a London-based money manager that specializes in buying emerging-market debt, was one of the biggest holders of the company’s bonds with more than $400 million worth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on end of June filings. Rules on how funds disclose their holdings vary in different countries. BlackRock Inc., UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc were also large owners, many of them held by vehicles that focus on riskier emerging market or Asian credits."" -Bloomberg"

China have about 50 trillions in real estates… HSBC is one of the larges lender to most developers in China… majority of developers in China are over leverage. Evergrande is first to fall. Who is next? HSBC is most hated bank… no country will bail out HSBC.
thought about buying but then I saw the Yahoo automatic post from 4 mos ago saying the price was $29.55 vs. today's $29.13 LOL
"The story is a bit sensationalist, similar to the Panama papers where the people involved in 85% of the documents were not outside the law. HSBC reported as required. The question is, why is there zero action from law enforcement and zero feedback from the same saying “yes it’s fishy, here’s an interim court order freezing the account.” Law enforcement is either ill-equipped or under motivated to “follow the money” as they do in the movies. It probably has something to do with the complexity which is beyond the expertise and education of most agents of governments.What the article implies is that the onus should be on a financial institution to somehow verify, or perhaps have the client verify source of funds to be transferred, which may have taken 20 years to accumulated or been accumulated 20 years ago. How long will non-criminal clients need to retain records to prove funds are above board. Caution must be taken in the erosion of a presumption of innocence. Flame away."
"I don’t understand why an honest person would use this bank. It seems to be operating as an arm of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong, assisting with the destruction of it’s democracy and the freedom of it’s citizens. I understand that those who signed up for the Chinese Government cancelled Ant Financial IPO, that was to have occurred in Hong Kong, haven’t received their money back. What’s going on. Can someone enlighten me?"

"Explain.. HSBC had a dividend holiday for almost 2 years due to govt. policy in the UK for banks to protect capital during Covid. Now the dividend is partially reinstated and HSBC has hoarded billions of pounds Sterling from unpaid dividends which they do not seem to be returning to shareholders as their dividend now is much less than it was before the dividend withdrawal. So, what is this company doing with all that retained capital? I have a big holding in HSBC but I have lost patience with their inept management and will likely sell after the next EX Div date. Does anyone have any reason to suggest that this company will turn around at some point?"
Two words: revenue decline …. 
It's brilliant that they jacked the div up. Investors would normally flee from Brexit.... but less will hold out a carrot. That's the kind of to the point strategy I like!
