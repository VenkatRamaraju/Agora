Does anyone have information about how much debt exposure HSBC has to Evergrande Group (恒大集团) ?
"I believe Chinese government will destroy Hong Kong financial, no matter what I would never invest any penny on it"
Bought this back in 2015 around $43... with dividends reinvested I am at about +15%... thinking I sell out of it - take the money and run. Thoughts?
Why is this share below $26 when most are positive on this share? Will it’s downward trend continue !
"New here, I see this is a foreign bank . Do you pay a tax to England on the dividends you receive ?"
Share price easily falls below $20 with the Evergrande exposure HSBC has... along with every other Chinese stock in their portfolio declining due to contagion.
Why Hsbc had such a huge loss today while other banks up ?
Nice dividend paid out this quarter...$1.05!
Anyone know if we are likely to get a dividend paid in November?
"China’s Ping An Insurance Group Co. raised its stake in HSBC Holdings Plc, cementing its position as the lender’s biggest shareholder.Ping An Asset Management Co., a unit of the insurer, bought 10.8 million shares of HSBC on Wednesday, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday. That brings the group’s stake to 8% from 7.95% previously. BlackRock Inc., the second-biggest holder, currently owns 7.14%."
China have about 50 trillions in real estates… HSBC is one of the larges lender to most developers in China… majority of developers in China are over leverage. Evergrande is first to fall. Who is next? HSBC is most hated bank… no country will bail out HSBC.
So how on earth can HSBC escape the failing China Bond market ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vCzeKUKdPY
What does it mean by a share buy back. Will that make the share price go up.
"I try to only post intelligent knowledge and here's a warning... HSBC is a China-Investment entity essentially and they have large exposure to Evergrande.""Ashmore Group Plc, a London-based money manager that specializes in buying emerging-market debt, was one of the biggest holders of the company’s bonds with more than $400 million worth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on end of June filings. Rules on how funds disclose their holdings vary in different countries. BlackRock Inc., UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc were also large owners, many of them held by vehicles that focus on riskier emerging market or Asian credits."" -Bloomberg"
This bank is done. Just a corporate club that talks to each other all day and produces nothing
"Some here may remember me, most will not. I expect HSBC to more than double in value over the next 18 months.... $60/share. My opinion. Do your own due diligence."
"Good news for repaying dividends, but how much for half year dividends?"
HSBC trading 40% below book value. P/E less than 12. Check Bloomberg for exact numbers.
""" SINGAPORE: HSBC dumped all its stake in Evergrande early this month, following in the footsteps of TCW, which exited the month before, according to Morningstar.The fund managers are the latest to join a chorus of Evergrande’s bears, including Pimco, Barings, and T. Rowe Price, which have shunned or have significantly cut exposure to Evergrande in their portfolios since mid-last year.

"Evergrande has turned out to be another nothing burger. Bond payment for on shore holders with more next week. Off shore holders are on hook for only $50 billion and #reuters reports today that Blackrock (big China pumper), #UBS and #HSBC have actually been buying more of the bonds the past few momths. Gotta love capitalism. ugh."
Two upgrades today and an imminent short squeeze. It's still early. Added more again .
$HSBC Target Set by Barclays GBX 530 Target Set by RBC Capital GBX 460
With rising interest rates HSBC will earn a lot of money. Will start buy backs later. Earnings should be good. Low pe.
see this going to 300 easily
I wish they’d just slash the 35k jobs already. It’s bad news every quarter.
How low is this going? 15$? Bankruptcies / bad loans / leveraged to the max / housing payments halted / mortgage crisis 2.0 - what happens to the price when this all impacts HSBC 2-6 months from now?
"HSBC has many strengths, sadly a decisive top management is not one of them. In a competitive world with the bankin a misallocation of assets situation (more in non profitable Europe and less in higher margin Far East) it is laughable that the board needs a leisurely twelve months to find a CEO."

"The Times of London: Analysts said that the insurer was unlikely to receive a seat on HSBC’s board as a result of its increased shareholding. However, there has been speculation that the bank may increase the number of directors from Asia. Currently only three of 15 are from the region. One of them, Laura Cha — chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchange, with close connections to Beijing — is expected to step down from HSBC’s board soon, having served for nine years.Ping An started buying shares in HSBC in 2016 and took its stake above 5 per cent in December 2017, after which it had to publicly disclose its holding and changes. It has suffered a heavy loss on its HSBC’s shares, which have lost nearly 60 per cent of their value in the past two years.Asian investors were said to be angry when HSBC along with other big banks in the UK were ordered to freeze dividends earlier this year to help cope with the financial cost of the pandemic.HSBC has been hit by several difficult issues in recent months, the most recent of which were reports last week of a leak of documents alleging that it along with other banks continued to move money for clients which suspected of engaging in criminal activity.HSBC has also been criticised by US and British politicians for supporting Beijing’s National Security Law to crack down on Hong Kong dissidents and has been attacked by Chinese authorities for its role in the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, finance chief of the Chinese telecoms group Huawei, in December 2018 at Vancouver airport on a warrant from the US.Observers believe that pressure on the bank may lift somewhat after the US election in November and once noise over Ms Meng’s contested extradition dies down, although that may not be for many months."
"Explain.. HSBC had a dividend holiday for almost 2 years due to govt. policy in the UK for banks to protect capital during Covid. Now the dividend is partially reinstated and HSBC has hoarded billions of pounds Sterling from unpaid dividends which they do not seem to be returning to shareholders as their dividend now is much less than it was before the dividend withdrawal. So, what is this company doing with all that retained capital? I have a big holding in HSBC but I have lost patience with their inept management and will likely sell after the next EX Div date. Does anyone have any reason to suggest that this company will turn around at some point?"
"From The Standard... "" HSBC (0005) will buy back up to US$2 billion (HK$15.6 billion) of shares by April 20 next year, with Morgan Stanley acting as principal, according to an exchange filing yesterday.The UK-based lender said it has entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary agreement with Morgan Stanley to allow Morgan Stanley, acting as principal, to purchase its ordinary shares up to US$2 billion with the US investment bank simultaneously selling the shares it buys to HSBC.The period, which began yesterday, runs through April 20, 2022.Morgan Stanley will make trading decisions regarding share buyback independently of HSBC.The Standard Channel More>>Any purchases of shares will be carried out on the London Stock Exchange, Aquis Exchange, BATS, Chi-X and/or Turquoise.This came after HSBC reported a 74 percent rise in third-quarter profit. The bank recorded a pre-tax profit of US$5.4 billion for the quarter to September versus US$3.1 billion 12 months earlier.Its Asia business contributed US$3.3 billion to the total pre-tax profits.In other news, The Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation said yesterday it has issued nearly 4 million credit cards in Hong Kong."""
"Money laundering is ubiquitous. If governments really wanted to clamp down on it, they would. It’s easier and politically expedient to blame HSBC and other banks. HSBC should pay the price because their business model is under significant threat; Brexit set the UK up for failure, the Eurozone is hostile to banks, and China promotes their own. HSBC needs a radical pivot to new sources of business; the old ways aren’t working, and haven’t been for some years. But the money laundering story is really a big nothing burger compared with the bank’s true issues."
Beat all analysts estimates! First quarter profit increased by 31% YOY. I’m guessing a +10% day tomorrow.
"The market cap meltdown of this stock is stunning. But with a 6% dividend and an apparent bottoming out, might this finally be a good entry point?"
"Aside from the outstanding valuation, still well below book, here's another reason the shares have a long way to go- HSBC is still the safest way to get in on China growth.""

Banks do well this Q 
HDBC has basically zero book value. So overleveraged in China. Bank of England will need to eventually bail them out or they will collapse.
