Had high hopes for this one. Luckily my money is tied up elsewhere and I couldn’t invest in here. But I’ll keep an eye on it.

"Nice mention in Barrons healthcare roundtable report this weekend. Edward Yoon, health care sector leader at Fidelity, said: ""We were private investors in Oak Street Health [OSH], which went public in August. The company is building primary-care clinics for Medicare patients and dramatically lowering costs. Its NPS [net promoter score, a measure of customer satisfaction] is through the roof. When this can be done at a national scale, which will happen over the next five to 10 years, it will create a very different experience for the next generation of people using Medicare. This is yet another secular grower with long-term tailwinds that can take costs out of the system."""

just look at insider selling and decide for yourself if you want to buy this falling knife that has close to a billion of debt due in less than 5 years and has a whopping book value of $1 per share and is losing money hand over fist- $100 million in the June quarter alone.

nice to see that management sold 100's of millions of dollars of OSH stock in July before the earnings!
Is this a money maker?

"Over time this will be a winner, just came out in August so no one will back it since it is so new. The overall plan and the baby boomer thing should make this a long term winner with some bumps in the road."

"forget the debt, have you've seen how many shares insiders hold? The value of the CFO's stock holdings are over $200 million! Insane"
OSH is down 6.99% to 51.03
lots of meaningless press releases over the last couple weeks as the stock snowballs downhill and insiders continue selling using their legalized insider trading under rule 10b5-1
"AMWL is in no man's land--trying to be provider technology but EPIC is building an enterprise grade solution with $TWLO. No provider is going to buy AMWL's solution when you get telemedicine integrated with their existing EMR (Epic). Doctor On Demand is in a much better position (should go public soon) since they are a full blown medical practice (like $OSH, Chenmed, etc)."

Not a lot of moving parts. Looks like it builds primary care centers and operates them. If they operate at a profit and beat earnings the stock should go up. Would be nice for this stock eventually have a dividend. GLTA
"Skylight health group...SLHG...is a younger version of oak street. They are a fraction of the price, on the nasdaq, and actually has a larger patient base then oak street! Growth is rapid with them. I'm moving my money there. Oak street is a joke. SLHG is a much better option in this space"
Sell this garbage!!! There is no serious money making in primary care!

Goldman Sachs raised this stock to the target price of $64 yet the stock price kept on falling over the announcements of raising more shares over the past few months. What is going on?

"In equal $ amounts, go Short OSH and go Long JAWS (a SPAC buying an OSH competitor, Cano Health). OSH is valued significantly higher than Cano Health, yet Cano has better economics. If the entire space appreciates, your long position will hedge your short. If the valuations of the two companies meet somewhere in the middle (more likely), you will profit on both trades. These types of symmetrical trading opportunities do not come along often."
