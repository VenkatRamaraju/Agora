"Zacks pumped this stock going back to July at least. Created a nice rise, but now we are living with the dump.Could be close to the bottom, but I doubt it."
"If this isn't a good buy now, then I don't know what is."
Still waiting

Surprised by the price action after the conference call. Good quarter with small beat on earnings and revenue. I did not hear anything negative. Anyone have any ideas?
They have now missed announcing or paying a 2nd qtr div. Last year's div was announced on June 13th and paid on July 15th. Has no one noticed this little problem?

"Well Zacks has been pumping this stock for awhile now. Some new buyers in and looks like the the shorts sold and shorted. Same ol, same ol.I guess the best way to play the market is contrarian. When they pump the stock, buy, but put a close trailing stop loss on it.Damn, I absolutely hat shorts."

The Form-8K just states that they want to move their dividend declaration dates to after earnings announcements in the future. A question on the Q2 earnings call asked about the dividend & UNPQ management gave a very fuzzy non-specific response. It is now after Q2 earnings announcement with no communication on the dividend status. Very poor way to treat your investors.

"Net for second quarter 2021 was 53 cents a share, beating estimates handily."
"One of the traders on CNBC halftime report has it as a buy, she just mentioned."
Short. Formed a wedge and has now broke through its support. Very good chance this is going down to 11

Low P/E and 4.34% dividend. Umpqua is a good value below 20 if you are in it for the long haul.
"UMPQ releases 2020 Q1 earnings today after market close. The general pattern for regional banks that have already reported for Q1 has been to miss earnings, increase loan loss reserves, and provide no future guidance for Q2. FITB,RF,CFG,ZION,PACW,CMA have all followed this pattern. Consensus estimates for UNPQ are for .30/share earnings & $279 million revenue. Extremely difficult to trade these stocks with no forward guidance & uncertainty of the amount of loan defaults in Q2. Regional banks have already been beaten down but be careful with trading UMPQ in the short term."
UMPQ announced the dividend payment. .21/share payable on 8/31. ex-div date is 8/19.

"Does anybody know what the effective date of the merger was, is, will be. I hope the date is set and has passed so we can figure out the actual value of COLB shares to apply the 0.5958 multiplier to. If this hasn't been set then the pps of COLB can be manipulated for weeks to come. That plus all the so called lawyer groups now bringing suit could really damage the value for UMPQ holders. I am sure the lawyers for both companies have considered this, but I have been wrong before, maybe even a couple of times."
have they announced a dividend yet?
"Filed a Form 8-K on June 17, 2020, announcing the shift in timing of a dividend declaration date from historical intra-quarter announcements to after quarterly earnings are finalized and applicable regulatory approval processes are complete."

"I have a bad feeling about this quarters earnings, and the potential for the dividend to be reduced. I sold most of my UMPQ last week at a break even $10.40, still holding 200 shares, just in case I'm wrong.If the dividend is cut, the price is likely to go down, till the dividend is back at 7-8% . Should this delayed dividend be .15, the new back the truck up price would be $7.25'ish. We'll know in 10 days. Good luck to longs."
.51 per share and the estimate was .38 per share. Umpqua hit it out of the park.

"Great company, nice stock,Dead board."
Can't believe they have not yet announced dividend. Very poor management and investor relations
"UMPQ is not the place to make big stock gains but it is a good place to be if you are looking to earn solid dividends. Far exceeds anything you can get in the bond market. Dividend over 5%. Stable financial condition. So, for me this is one of the good long term investments to earn solid dividends and not be too concerned with risk."

"I’m not thrilled by this merger announcement, but not surprised either. I wish it had been the other way around, with UMPQ as the bigger bank being the acquirer. Based on current dividend policies of the two, this will result in a 15 percent dividend cut to UMPQ shareholders. COLB has a sketchy history of dividend payouts, whereas UMPQ has been mostly stable. Both have earnings coming up, so guess we’ll get a clearer picture of where this is going."
All good! So why did the pps go down $.32 or 1.64%. I think a couple of hedge funds are playing the usual games.

"UMPQ's earning were supposed to be announced on the 21st. Don't know about COLB. When is the magic date when UNPQ will disappear and my account will show COLB. I now they are keeping the Umpqua name for namesake purposes, but as a ticker symbol it will probably go away. Any comments?"
"Good quarter - fourth in a row where UMPQ has beat on earnings. A $400M buy back, which would be ~10% of the current market cap. Current dividend yields about 4.7%. Muted price response to all this. This is such a quiet stock."
UMPQ reached a 52 Week low at $16.71
Sifting through bank names who will benefit from the steepening of the yield curve that is a tide lifting all names... this AM on CNBC a guest analyst suggested a less known name... UMPQ nice plug for the retail trade which I'll likely follow if price activity stays reasonable.
So is this the 2 qtr dividend Which would have only 3 for this year. Sale or merger ?

"Bank stocks in general are in the pits. General feelings are they are going to take big hits from defaults on their lending portfolios. Probably true. So, not a good place to be for the foreseeable future. Porblem is that us inventors who have been caught long in these stocks stand to lose significant amounts if we sell. So, either must hold for probably at least a year or sell for big losses. It might get worse for investors in bank stocks once the actual portfolio delinquency and losses start to become reality. I don't think the banks will go under and the Feds will support them but the losses will be out sized for sure."

"UMPQ is a good stock for the long haul. I have some shares and am happy with the recent results. If anyone is looking for a smaller banking outfit that is growing fast and selling at a bargain price, then Oregon Bancorp (ORBN) is worth a closer look. This small cap bank has only about a million shares outstanding. The stock is selling for less than 7 times estimated EPS of $4.95 for 2017. Earnings per share for the third quarter were up 33% over the prior year. Normally, a bank with a return on assets of 1.00% is very good. ORBN has an annualized return on assets of 4.00%! Currently, the average small cap bank stock is selling for PE ratios of 12-15. This small cap growth company should be selling for roughly double the current price of $32.50 per share."

What is going on?!?!? Market up today...why is this $@$8 crashing?
UMPQ will not look good for the near term. Might be a year out before a return to stability.
Why the drop?
"Opened a position in my taxable account at 16.19 just before the ex- date. Bought more today in my IRA at 15.85. Likelihood of interest rate cuts driving bank stocks lower, but long term this looks like a good play with better than 5 percent dividend at these levels. Also like Umpqua’s approach to banking."
"Merger with Columbia Banking announced. UMPQ down 5%, and Columbia Banking down 15%. The announcement said UMPQ was receiving a premium, but since Columbia Banking is down so much, no premium to UMPQ.Odd. Usually one stock goes up, one goes down, when a merger is announced. Not both.Maybe investors think it is a merger that makes no sense."
"from the press release: Company Release - 7/21/2021 4:05 PM ETSecond quarter 2021 Results- Net income of $116.1 million, or $0.53 per common share- Non-PPP loan balances increased $650.5 million or 3.2%- Deposit balances increased $266.7 million or 1.0%- Provision for credit losses recapture of $23.0 million as economic conditions improve"
"So if the Fed. raises rates the bank would charge more on loans . With the economy opening back up with higher employment more people have more cash. More people will/may take out loans due to pent up Covid demand to do get anything . PPS should go up , could we see $25 to $30 range in the next six months?"
"Well, that certainly explains the constant selling pressure. Could figure out why the large institutions would be selling this stock. I assume that the largest holders knew the pps would go down when the purchase was announced. Question is when did the institutions know about the purchase. Zacks helped by pumping the stock at the most inappropriate time, IMO. What a game!"

UMPQ is a big disappointment so I am selling all my shares and moving on. The stock is going no where even though the bank's performance has been acceptable.
"Kind of a side note. I am amazed at the number of organizations that are out dangling the bait of the best ever stocks, the new tech that will change your bathroom habits, the new possible cure for almost anything.All trying to get you to sign up for their weekly newsletter full of what stocks to buy, sell, option trade, ......whatever. Do you think for one minute they care about your portfolio or you. And if they are so damn smartwhy would they share information or proprietary algorithms with us dummies. Remember we are the fodder.The funds don't attack each other, IMO they probably communicate with each other to manipulate the market. So they have go after the individual investor's money.President Reagan said"" When the government shows up at your doorstep and says they want to help you, run for your lives. IMO, the same holds true for all the stock market gurus with a newsletter or book.Do a little study, find something that works a bit, and stick with it. This shouldn't be poker!"
UMPQ has done better than some small regional banks but is still down more than 35% in the past 3 months. Q1 report due April 15th should be very revealing.

"It is and will remain unclear how UMPQ will perform the rest of the year. If the Feds bail out S/M business owners the delinquent and write-offs might not be so bad as to wipe out UMPQ's bottom line. I would not count on it though. I am long on UMPQ and plan on holding due to the uncertainty and the fact that selling today would generate big losses for my portfolio. Also, no one knows the status of the dividend."
UMPQ is down 11.31% to 10.27

UMPQ is possibly a good buy with good upside when the market bottoms. It is down more than most other regional banks but is actually better financially than the average regional bank. Dividend is probably safe. Upside shift after bottom could be extraordinary.
