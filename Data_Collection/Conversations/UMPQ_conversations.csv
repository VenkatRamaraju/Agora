UMPQ is a big disappointment so I am selling all my shares and moving on. The stock is going no where even though the bank's performance has been acceptable.
The Form-8K just states that they want to move their dividend declaration dates to after earnings announcements in the future. A question on the Q2 earnings call asked about the dividend & UNPQ management gave a very fuzzy non-specific response. It is now after Q2 earnings announcement with no communication on the dividend status. Very poor way to treat your investors.
"Well, that certainly explains the constant selling pressure. Could figure out why the large institutions would be selling this stock. I assume that the largest holders knew the pps would go down when the purchase was announced. Question is when did the institutions know about the purchase. Zacks helped by pumping the stock at the most inappropriate time, IMO. What a game!"
"Merger with Columbia Banking announced. UMPQ down 5%, and Columbia Banking down 15%. The announcement said UMPQ was receiving a premium, but since Columbia Banking is down so much, no premium to UMPQ.Odd. Usually one stock goes up, one goes down, when a merger is announced. Not both.Maybe investors think it is a merger that makes no sense."
UMPQ is possibly a good buy with good upside when the market bottoms. It is down more than most other regional banks but is actually better financially than the average regional bank. Dividend is probably safe. Upside shift after bottom could be extraordinary.
Can't believe they have not yet announced dividend. Very poor management and investor relations
"Zacks pumped this stock going back to July at least. Created a nice rise, but now we are living with the dump.Could be close to the bottom, but I doubt it."

"from the press release: Company Release - 7/21/2021 4:05 PM ETSecond quarter 2021 Results- Net income of $116.1 million, or $0.53 per common share- Non-PPP loan balances increased $650.5 million or 3.2%- Deposit balances increased $266.7 million or 1.0%- Provision for credit losses recapture of $23.0 million as economic conditions improve"
"UMPQ is not the place to make big stock gains but it is a good place to be if you are looking to earn solid dividends. Far exceeds anything you can get in the bond market. Dividend over 5%. Stable financial condition. So, for me this is one of the good long term investments to earn solid dividends and not be too concerned with risk."
"I’m not thrilled by this merger announcement, but not surprised either. I wish it had been the other way around, with UMPQ as the bigger bank being the acquirer. Based on current dividend policies of the two, this will result in a 15 percent dividend cut to UMPQ shareholders. COLB has a sketchy history of dividend payouts, whereas UMPQ has been mostly stable. Both have earnings coming up, so guess we’ll get a clearer picture of where this is going."
"Or, it’s a good time to add slowly to your positions and bring down the cost basis. As long as the bank is going to make it through this mess, it’s probably a once in a decade opportunity to add here. Just food for thought "
UMPQ announced the dividend payment. .21/share payable on 8/31. ex-div date is 8/19.
"One of the traders on CNBC halftime report has it as a buy, she just mentioned."
"UMPQ's earning were supposed to be announced on the 21st. Don't know about COLB. When is the magic date when UNPQ will disappear and my account will show COLB. I now they are keeping the Umpqua name for namesake purposes, but as a ticker symbol it will probably go away. Any comments?"
"Does anybody know what the effective date of the merger was, is, will be. I hope the date is set and has passed so we can figure out the actual value of COLB shares to apply the 0.5958 multiplier to. If this hasn't been set then the pps of COLB can be manipulated for weeks to come. That plus all the so called lawyer groups now bringing suit could really damage the value for UMPQ holders. I am sure the lawyers for both companies have considered this, but I have been wrong before, maybe even a couple of times."
They have now missed announcing or paying a 2nd qtr div. Last year's div was announced on June 13th and paid on July 15th. Has no one noticed this little problem?

"Bank stocks in general are in the pits. General feelings are they are going to take big hits from defaults on their lending portfolios. Probably true. So, not a good place to be for the foreseeable future. Porblem is that us inventors who have been caught long in these stocks stand to lose significant amounts if we sell. So, either must hold for probably at least a year or sell for big losses. It might get worse for investors in bank stocks once the actual portfolio delinquency and losses start to become reality. I don't think the banks will go under and the Feds will support them but the losses will be out sized for sure."
Sifting through bank names who will benefit from the steepening of the yield curve that is a tide lifting all names... this AM on CNBC a guest analyst suggested a less known name... UMPQ nice plug for the retail trade which I'll likely follow if price activity stays reasonable.
