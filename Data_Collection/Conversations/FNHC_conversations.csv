Anybody go to the annual meeting yesterday? Would love to hear any updates.
"question: the hurricane season started at the end of June, why do they assume the Q2 will be bad ? there is a chance we might see a good quarter no ?"
Analyst says average min price should be 7$. Compare to it's drop from 20$ to 4$ is too much. So might reverse to above 7$.
"Thought with the hurricane causing very little damage in Fla, it would be up more the past couple days....what is the next catalyst for price change?"
FNHC reached a 52 Week low at 11.04
Reaffirm earnings then shorts get killed.
"?This winter storm was the sixth severe weather event to impact FedNat since July 1,.."" #$%$ man ???"
"Wow, Q4. I have never seen a mgmt and Board destroy a company like this. With URI, book is now around 9/sh. Lost 50% of book is about a year. The dividend is gone. They didn’t have the guts to say it out loud. That’s why they gave you the debt/capital ratio. Above 35% = no dividends. And they still haven’t sold it."
it looks like the Florida legislature is going to change the law on assignment of benefits for insurance claims. This could be very beneficial to Federated and of course all other insurance companies in Florida
FNHC is down 5.01% to 12.13
"premiums are rising, book of business is shrinking, and claims are declining, this quarter will be significantly better, we are on track to fix this company. and the price of the stock will follow."
I view the $6.00 as a new floor for the stock (not a ceiling). I believe the upcoming meeting will provide confidence not only around capitalization but also will allow FNHC to focus once again on growth markets. I am still increasing my position at these levels. I believe we will see stability around $7-8 over the next 2-3 quarters. Then as business cash flows return the stock will correct in 12-18 months.
FNHC will likely announce it is getting acquired later today.
Hurricane Ida is going to be the end of Federated due to their exposure from that stupid acquisition made Maison. This is it boys I'm predicting that they will be down graded by Demotech and shortly there after go to the state and hand them the keys. Wow what a colossal fail on this management team and board of directors.
Last stock offering was at $19.50 in August 2014. Current stock price ~ $18.00. Current HCI deal worth $24/sh based on last reported offer. The HCI offer from ~10 years ago or so would be worth $25. (1/2 share + $1) Sale of the Company should be worth close to $36#$%$ 2x book assuming $18/sh book. It will be interesting how this conference call is spun. There should be a loss.
"wow, what a disaster, i am down 50% didnt expect it to be this bad"
"Well, they started to cover short position as i expected."
69c vs expected 62c
they expect substantially less hit than the $18.5M for first retentionin my mind mind substantial is < 50%what about yours ?
FedNat is down 9.63% to 4.60
"I started looking into investing in this company, but then I noticed, this company FNHC has missed estimates in all 4 of the 4 most recent quarters. Terrible performance!"
I still think this stock going to closed GREEN today.... Let's say am crazy to be the first to say so.
FedNat is up 8.35% to 7.40
Any insights on how much Hurricane Laura impacts FNHC? Is this why the stock is down lately?
FNHC is down -5.31% to 24.80
FedNat reached a 52 Week low at 10.37
FedNat is down 10.95% to 6.18
Is it buy?
Did you see what Chubb is paying for The Hartford? 1.3 x book? What would that value FNHC at? $15??
this one is on fire holy
"how did they issued shares in April, when they knew the situation was that bad, they didn't disclose this, this is a crime, it is a scam"
"So reassuring that Braun spent $24k of his $1million salary to buy shares in the offering...thx for really stepping up, loser"
FedNat appointed strategic advisers - working on a sale no doubt - $10 per share minimum
FNHC is down 5.22% to $22.96
Wouldn't be surprised insiders bought some.
Wont sell the company might as well try to destroy it..
"It is a great misfortune for those in Lakes Charles and nearby that fate brought them Delta on top of Laura, but Delta was less violent than feared for whatever consolation it may bring.New damage on top of earlier damage may be a better calamity than Delta ravaging an entirely new area. They took the bullet for many but someone always does somewhere along the way.I hope the hurricane season ends soon for all involved. 2020 has brouht enough pain for all."
FNHC is up 5.05% to 13.95

"why be done with it, just keep trading it. Its been a great trader over the years."
Any chance this will be the straw to trigger the “strategic action” they supposedly started studying several qtrs ago?? 
No market reaction really to either earnings or the announcement of them initiating a “strategic review” of the company. Strange...
looks like FNHC has reached its maximum out of pocket for this season ?Tangible book is what ? 15.26 as of 6/2020 - ( 50M * .73 ) / 13.8 after tax so that leaves about 12.60 ?
FedNat reached a 52 Week low at 5.81

"not much sellers left, the weak hands are gone"
"Book value down 65% YOY....$16 to $5......Loss ratio and expense ratio up approx $100% each, increased Quota Shares to prob the max allowed, hence ceding commission adding to surplus....and still surplus infusions needed ($40 million after 6/30)..........failure to raise meaningful capital in open market.....this ship is sinking and ....on life support.....only question is when the plug gets pulled....."
"all set, we are ready for take off. please fasten your seatbelt"
FNHC is down 5.61% to 12.79
"Top excuses on the conf call tomorrow:1. Wind2. Lawyers3. “I didn’t know we were supposed to make money.”4. “As God as my witness, I thought turkeys could fly.”"
Some early reaction to Ida??
Too cheap to not buy at this point. Grossly undervalued
FedNat reached a 52 Week low at 5.34
Somebody’s buying it. Average volume over last 5 days has been approximately double the historical average.
Worth buying 100 sharesWill sell when everyone wants a piece at 30

Wish insiders would step up and start buying
10-k delayed possible restate of 2020??this cant be good
They are probably rethinking those discussions HCI attempted to have with them on two separate occasions!
"I wonder why they delayed their earnings report by a week?? That usually means something unusual is happening behind the scenes and they need time to reassess certain financial assumptions, or, to get in better shape for a significant announcement."
Is this stock Hurricane Irma sensitive?
"if the company is solvent, this will end up being a buy under $5the placement may very well mark the bottom here"
FedNat is up 5.09% to 11.15
WE just bought some shares of FNHC...Thank you !!!
"What are you waiting for, a bell to go off."
You need to read the 8-k from yesterday. FNHC understated their 2020 losses by $4-$7MM. Not sure how that happens when they just announced earnings. They are also going to have a material weakness in internal controls when the 10-K comes out.
"@guppy and @mutinycapital - you guys sound like you have good insights on this company. What are you doing at these prices. Buying, selling or holding on?"
FedNat is up 7.96% to 10.99
big volume
Big miss for the second consecutive quarter. Will wait to see where this stands when the adjusted key statistics come out.
What's up here?
How did they botch their reinsurance program to the point where they got to this state ? no firings ?
FNHC is down 4.97% to 15.11

"I’m so disappointed in this company’s financial results and stock price. However, I will say that as a Florida property owner, homeowners insurance in Fla is hard to find and rates are really going up. If by any stroke of luck, we have a relatively light hit from hurricanes this year, I would have to believe that you could see a strong surge in underwriting profits for all carriers doing business in the state including FNHC. Approved Rate increases are significant."

FedNat reached a 52 Week low at 8.07
"Earnings miss can bring us sub $10. Beat please. Please.,"
"If they followed their typical qtr end pattern, they would have reported earnings last week. Possibility that it is being delayed due to news about their “strategic review” they initiated 3-4 months ago?"
I'm getting the feeling that a buy-out is coming soon. State Farm could benefit and turn this company around drastically.
whats the catch ?
FedNat reached a 52 Week low at 10.20
"I would like to release an opinion. FedNat is an insurance company who hopefully makes money by selling more in insurance than it has to pay out for damage done to homes, etc. from natural disasters. That being said, what is happening this year regarding hurricanes from the east is that there is a natural phenomenon from the Sahara Dessert in mean the means of a dust cloud which travels from Africa over the Atlantic and eventually reaches Florida. This dust while it may be annoying provides a buffer which helps either hurricanes from forming or reduces the strength of a hurricane. You can look this up on Google to find proof of this info for yourself. Therefore wouldn't one think that as a result of this phenomenon the number or the strength of hurricanes hitting Florida the year will be fewer than expected. This leads me to believe that insurance companies such as FedNat will benefit by not having to pay out as much thus leading to higher profits. I would like to hear some thoughts from you regarding this one way or another. Thank You"

"its raining gold, just go outside"
Geez. Think they will make it to the qtrly earnings report?!?
FedNat is down 6.06% to 5.12
I think it’s getting set up to be bought out. “Strategic advisors” due diligence resulted in a price range for the book of business that required BOD to get shareholder price to a better starting point so negotiations could take place.
"if you look at the 5 year chart, you will see that this decline in the oast two three years is engineered and programed. we are about to break the bearish trend line, that will happen in the next 30 days. and when that happens, we will enter a very long bullish period. now is the best time to buy."

"ISS, FNHC shareholders need your help. I know you’re looking at the proposals since they just changed McCahill’s comp plan to try to get your approval. What about #1 and #2? The stock has lost more than 80% of its value over the past five years and has a negative value since the IPO 22 years ago. There is no way you should recommend voting for #1 based on your own listed guidelines. Same for #2. Based on historical returns, you shouldn’t agree to a 50% additional dilution. Especially since the BOD got Broadridge to say doubling the approved shares in articles of incorporation are a “routine matter”. ISS’s recommendation will probably decide #2 now since broker votes will count."

"whats with all these winter storms lately ?? why so many ? we already had 2-3 in late 2020, now in February too ??"

"Proxy reminder. You should be receiving them this week. Vote:1) Against the nominee;2) Against share dilution; and3) Against exec comp.This is a chance to vote out Simberg on #1 if he doesn’t get a majority of votes cast. Broker votes don’t count. He has taken a $7.50 IPO in 1998 ($12.11 inflation adjusted per BLS) to the current price around $5 after more than 22 years. It’s time for a change.On #2, I’m tired of being diluted out with a declining share price and book value.On #3, Mr. Braun owes the shareholders money for just being employed after the poor management and results. He doesn’t deserve a comp package at all."
HCI offers to buy FNHC at an exchange of one-half an HCI share for each FNHC share (currently $20.26 in HCI stock for each FNHC share) with an $18 floor in case HCI stock reacts unfavorably.

the possible rewards here are magnificent for long term investors
BV per share was north of 17 last qtr. Will be interesting to see what it is now. I think this company looks pretty deeply discounted. Hoping for a slow and steady rise post earnings to mid teens
"Wilcox might be better. Buying only 100 shares. All the Directors get paid about $100k in cash each year, plus another $100k in stock. (Yes, the Directors will dilute the shareholders out again.). It would have been nice if they could have purchased shares equivalent to their Board fees. Braun should need to buy because he’s supposed to have stock holdings equal to a certain multiple of his salary. He shouldn’t be in compliance."

"Delta is 10 to 15 million net PRE TAXThe Company currently estimates that its initial aggregate gross losses as a result of Hurricane Delta, which will be paid out in the coming months, will exceed its single-event aggregate reinsurance retention of $25 million. It is anticipated that the total net impact to the Company will be reduced to $10-15 million, pre-tax, as a result of additional underlying catastrophe reinsurance protection in place on FNIC’s non-Florida business and the 50% quota-share reinsurance treaty in place on the book written by SageSure Insurance Managers LLC, our independent Managing General Underwriter partner."
Why would they price it so low??
They didn’t put out a formal press release. Only filed the 8-K and put it on the FedNat website.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001069996/000106999621000095/fnhcq1-2021pressrelease.htm

FedNat has quite a bit of business in Texas and my guess is that the reinsurers are going to fight paying freeze up claims in Texas. The reinsurance programs are geared to hurricanes and protracted weather events are generally not covered.
