What was this drop all about? Is this like the last one down to 132 then followed by major buying? Perhaps the lull and margin clean out leading up to AARC NCI EORTC conference oct 7-9.

"First take on the MRTX data dump today. It's still early but, based upon a very small patient sample, we would appear to be equal to, or perhaps better than AMGN's KRAS drug which, to me, is a win as it says we're in the game in a serious way.Still, MRTX has more work to do...and subsequent data for both MRTX and AMGN could move the needle meaningfully in our favor (or against us if future reads do not confirm our preliminary data). AMGN, if I'm not mistaken, has been given a fast-track pathway to approval....and we also should be given similar concessions....as the more robust data for both companies unfolds, one may be a more clear winner....but the data confirmations are patient-dependent and will read out several quarters from now.I like our odds. We're the little engine that could and our market cap vs AMGN in KRAS-related indications/solutions is minuscule and, with further improvement in our data, our upside will be quite large. Someone posted $200 as a price target. That may eventually happen but, in the near-term, I'm happy to be ""in play"" with our data and will await next readouts....who knows how far we may go...but I have a feeling it's a long way....right now, $200 looks good. :-)"
New 6-month closing high yesterday....a very encouraging sign.

"Headlines from this morning's MRTX Press Release are very encouraging. See the rest of the release for details.To me, this could get MRTX shares well over $225 in the near term....and higher thereafter as word spreads about the possible implications for this set of drug treatments for several cancers.Mirati Therapeutics Reports Investigational Adagrasib (MRTX849) Preliminary Data Demonstrating Tolerability and Durable Anti-Tumor Activity as well as Initial MRTX1133 Preclinical DataSun, October 25, 2020, 10:45 AM EDT- 45% confirmed ORR and 96% DCR across Phase 1/1b and Phase 2 monotherapy cohorts in patients with advanced NSCLC- Median duration of treatment >8 months with 50% of patients and 83% of responders still on treatment in the Phase 1/1b monotherapy cohort in patients with advanced NSCLC- Well-tolerated safety profile across monotherapy and combination trials- Initial preclinical data for MRTX1133, the Company's potential first-in-class KRAS G12D selective inhibitor, demonstrate significant tumor regression in mutant animal models; IND filing planned for 1H 2021"

"From Fierce PharmaThe comment followed the same tone from Davis during an investors’ call about the Acceleron deal last week when he said Merck is “well-positioned financially to complete this transaction or maintaining our ability to pursue additional opportunities” and that “business development remains an important priority for Merck.”It begs the question: Where is Merck looking next?Mirati Therapeutics is one target on Merck’s M&A shortlist, FT reported, citing people briefed on the matter. The California biotech is a frontrunner in the hot KRAS race; its adagrasib is close behind Amgen’s first-in-class Lumakras. At the recent ESMO 2021 event, Mirati reported encouraging data in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer that look competitive.With a potential FDA filing for adagrasib expected later this year, SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens has projected combined peak U.S. and EU sales for the KRAS inhibitor in the two tumor types at $3.84 billion."
"BLAIR: #AACR21 $INCY $AGEN $MRTX $ITOS Abstract Highlights and Meeting ItineraryOn Saturday, April 10, through Thursday, April 15, the American Association of CancerResearch (AACR) will host the first of two week-long virtual conferences, with the second tobe hosted on Monday, May 17, through Friday, May 21. Full regular abstracts were posted tothe AACR meeting website on March 10 with clinical trial and late-breaking abstracts to bereleased at the start of the conference, and in this note we highlight several important datapresentations for our coverage list and other data of interest. In addition, an itinerary of allrelevant presentations to our coverage list and the wider oncology landscape is appended atthe end of this note.In particular, we highlight:• Incyte (INCY $83.18; Outperform) will be providing the first clinical update with thecompany’s A2A/A2B receptor inhibitor and hosting a conference call with investors(on Monday, April 12) to discuss the company’s broader adenosine targeting strategy,including a CD73 antibody. The adenosine pathway has garnered significant industryinterest, and therapies targeting this pathway have led to monotherapy responses,although clear clinical development paths have yet to be established, in our opinion.• The next data point for TIGIT antibodies will come from iTeos (ITOS $34.54), which willpresent preliminary Phase I data with EOS884448 as a monotherapy. Recent managementcommentary suggests pharmacodynamic effects of EOS884448 will be focused on theperiphery for the AACR presentation, with biopsy analysis coming later in the year. Recallother TIGIT antibodies have shown minimal activity as a monotherapy, with the mostapparent benefit coming when combined with PD-(L)1 antibodies in PD-L1–positivepatients. The company will also host an investor call on Monday, April 12.• Agenus (AGEN $2.89; Outperform) will provide an update from the ongoing trialevaluating the combination of AGEN1181, a next-generation CTLA-4 antibody withFc enhancements, and balstilimab, the company’s PD-1 antibody. As of February, thecompany reported a 23% response rate (5/22 patients), achieving responses in tumorsunlikely to respond to PD-(L)1 antibody monotherapy, including microsatellite stablecolorectal and endometrial cancers. We will host a call with Agenus management onSaturday, April 10, to discuss the updated results (see page 5 for registration link).• Although mainly preclinical in nature, several companies will provide updates on KRASG12C inhibitors, attempting to improve on the results presented to date by Amgen(AMGN $249.10; Market Perform) and Mirati (MRTX $173.91). In particular, the abstractsfocus on proposed combination regimens, with preclinical efficacy reported for severalcombinations targeting the MAPK pathway.AgenusAgenus will present updated clinical data with the company’s novel Fc-enhanced CTLA-4 antibody, AGEN1181, for which thecompany has previously disclosed multiple confirmed responses as monotherapy and in combination with the PD1 antibodybalstilimab. As of the most recent update, the combination of AGEN1181 and balstilimab resulted in a 23% response rate(5/22) across a variety of tumor types, including many that would not be expected to respond to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, suchas microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) and MSS endometrial cancer. These particularly tough-to-treat cancertypes do not respond to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, making the initial data for AGEN1181 combination more impressive. Two MSSendometrial cancer patients have achieved responses, one on monotherapy AGEN1181 and a second on the combination withbalstilimab. In addition, a confirmed partial response in an MSS CRC patient treated with the combination was also announcedin February of this year. We continue to be encouraged by the safety profile of the drug and initial biomarker and efficacy data,and look forward to additional updates at the upcoming AACR meeting"

"While I initially disagreed with the timing of the announcement of the new CEO given the fact that substantial favorable development activity was also released at approximately the same time, it does appear that the stock is shaking off the impact of the multiple announcements and is focusing, as it should, on the race to get the KRAS-drugs before the FDA and keep the lead in CRC and close the gap on lung cancer treatments, etc., etc.I'm sure the new CEO, given his multiple experiences will prove to be just ""what the doctor ordered"" to keep the focus of the company on its many longer-term goals."
Both Mirati and Seagen are primo targets to be taken out in the next 12 months….big pharma needs to check their bankrolls and their pipelines and proceed accordingly.
ONE share traded pre-market today at $223.96........premonition perhaps.
"Is Monday's ""news"" leaking out?"
