"Get ready for $80++ by mid-February. I'm also expecting a possible buy-out at a low triple digit number sometime this year. No guarantees and, as always, please do your own DD."
Today was the bottom.
"I also just noticed that Mirati filed a shelf registration (S-3) yesterday allowing them to sell additional securities when they feel it appropriate. That, in all likelihood, contributed to yesterday's weakness and, also probably, the recent ho-hum share price trading....since I'm sure the word had gotten out.Now that the decks are cleared we may be in better shape going forward."
Afternoon reversal today...close above $55....watch for it.
MRTX is down -7.66% to 48.80
The new offering is only at 13. Better grab your profit now before it drops.
MRTX is up 9.19% to $58.60
This is the top of the Pump and Dump. It has to go below $4.00 anyway. #scam
back to 80....downgrade on the fact they haven't even started any trials yet...
Mirati Therapeutics is down 5.48% to 161.20
There will either be some very good data soon to be reported....or MRTX is in the sights of an acquirer.
"Just to be clear about something:"" Mirati has zero debt,"
"So you think Mirati is the next big thing?Targovax is a Norwegian biotech company with two immuno-oncology-platforms.Targovax (OSE:TRVX) is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing oncolytic viruses to target hard-to-treat solid tumors. Targovax’s lead product candidate, ONCOS-102, is a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus, which has been engineered to selectively infect cancer cells and activate the immune system to fight the cancer.ONCOS-102 is currently being tested in mesothelioma, melanoma and peritoneal malignancies and has already shown promising clinical results both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, and a checkpoint inhibitor."
"This company could be next big winner, please check it out, ZSAN, thanks for looking"
"Think about this. MRTX has approx. 44.1 MM shares O/S on a fully-diluted basis....or 32.36 MM shares if you ignore the pre-funded warrants which are yet to be exercised. If we take the actual shares outstanding at present to be 32.36 MM shares, we find the following:1) The top 5 institutional holders own 14.35 MM shares representing just over 44% of the effective float.2) The top 10 institutional holders own 21.09 MM shares representing just over 65% of the effective float.3) Forgetting about other institutions beyond the top 10 for the moment, the residual share count available for trading is only about 11.27 MM shares.4) The average daily trading volume is just about 500,000 shares.5) This means that the residual share count turns over about every 22 1/2 days....an exceptionally high number.6) This explains the wide spread between the usual bid and ask prices shown and the exceptional share price volatility.7) Keep in mind: my data comes from current available sources, counts only the largest 10 institutional holders (and, obviously, ignores both other institutional holders as well as shares held by both management and the company's Directors."
MRTX reached a new All Time High at 58.90
MRTX is down -7.00% to 53.47

It’s called a bioscam for a reason. $MRTX $NLNK $ANAB $AUPH $GALT $COOL $CARA $CNAT $MNKD $CALA and all other biotech scams will end up the same.
What a genius Dr. Baum is! Here's his interview from 2013 predicting ALL of this:https://www.twst.com/interview/interview-with-the-president-and-ceo-mirati-therapeutics-inc-mrtx
"This bottoming process is just awful to watch....and experience.....but it looks like we're almost done.....bottoming, that is."
"One analyst is not happy at all with the recent data presented at ESMO by DVAX. However, he likes the IDRA's approach but still wants to see more confirmation of TILSO effect in the combo , means more data..Similar to $MRTX, $DVAX reports ""responses that will not confirm"" as wellFrom a 21.4% listed ORR for the PD-1 refractory study, only half that will confirm for a true ITT ORR of 10%And according to the Swimmer plot for PD-1 naive melanoma, only 24/47 confirmed ORR = 51% ORRWhen the same analyst was asked why DVAX data he doesn't like, below was his reply which I don't understand ofcourse :-)-ECHO-301-ITT analysis-Abscopal effect-Single arm melanoma trials poorly predict randomized data (see https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/159087 )-ECHO-301-No dose response-ECHO-301-ECHO-301"
"Don't you just love how an analyst, with the stock around $155, puts a $239 price target on it?It'd be so much more plausible if analysts would say ""over $200,"" ""$240"" or ""up by about 50%."" I guess putting an odd price target is supposed to make us think that there is some greater certainty in their analysis."
It’s going down again. How long do you think it would go down ?
why $2 drop. Any news or just profit taking
"WITH A SECONDARY IN JANUARY AT $62, PRETTY HARD NOT TO THINK NEWS WILL BE JUST FINE, SO STOCK JUMPS"
"Baum's slides, which accompanied his talk today at JPM, are on the MRTX web site.The KRAS stuff is very interesting."
Downgrade to 85.Alert.
I should have mentioned that the two updates are scheduled for October 21 and 22 in the EU.
MRTX just woke up from its recent nap.
This stock is heading to $200
"VERY nice! All out for now-( made a nice double),I will come back on the pull back again. Now adding to VERI -"
Shorts are posting every minute predicting a fall that never comes. +138%
Two outcomes of today. Close low $10. Or breach $13+
"Just to be more clear, the all-time closing high occurred on July 3, 2019 and the closing price was $109.60."
If you buy at this price you can only lose! Let it fall buy at $6.00 today I guarantee!
"Game on. Last hour fireworks....just like the ""old days."" The ""old days"" were last year....and it appears we have FINALLY found that elusive bottom."
"Lots of ""Big Money"" name players getting taken to the MRTX cleaners."
"Some are so crazy buying this stock at this price range. It is not even profitable yet , LOL. HahahahaMaking me laugh so bad:)))))"
"Here's how I look at this. In rough terms, AMGN has $24 Billion in revenues while MRTX has no revenues yet. AMGN's market cap is about $105 B while MRTX's market cap is about $3.2 B.If an effective KRas platform represents somewhere between $3 B and $5 B, let's say, that AMGN and MRTX each capture half of that opportunity....so let's use $ 2 B for each of AMGN and MRTX, then, applying a 5X revenue valuation, each of AMGN and MRTX will add approximate $10 B to their market cap. $10 B added to AMGN's market cap means an approximate 10% increase in market cap (and share price) while a $10 B addition to MRTX's market cap suggests MRTX's market cap could go to approximately $12 B which would represent a share price well north of $300."
Buying more here think will see $10 pretty soon $MRTX
It was a flip between this and a Maserati. I like cars. Haha.
Ka-Boom. Back in the hunt. $190 on the near-term horizon and $200++ by Labor Day.
This is the real rocket.
MRTX is up 8.28% to $38.70
Short away guys and gals since you're all over this one. Cover at $110? $125? Higher?Adios..........
An ugly day....I hope its the underwriter dropping the price to offload some of their shares to institutional buddies under $160.
MRTX reached an all time high at 131.35
Just trading the range mid 60s to the upper 70s til market bottoms for now...massive bear rally should develope soon
"today, below 13"
"To Harold's two recent posts, obviously the market disagrees with his characterization of MRTX as a ""scam."" In fact CEO Charles Baum is quite impressive and gave a great presentation at the very recent Leerink meeting. I have also been impressed with the team assembled at the company and their backgrounds. While most smaller biotechs are not generating revenues, investments in them have to be based upon pipeline potential.Finally MRTX's hook-up with BeiGene sounds quite impressive as a way to move the company forward at a faster pace because BeiGene is well capitalized and has a substantial org. in place.I like the company's potential and give the\m a very good chance to be successful....there will be several pipeline read-outs later this year which should enable a better view of the way forward."
$18 Monday open! Whoop Whoop
"Mirati today closed at a new all-time high of $129.56, eclipsing the previous high water mark of $128.86 recorded last December.The stock continues to act very well. Today's 2nd Q report confirms fundamental progress across multiple fronts, yet the ""story"", aside from several well-regarded institutions, remains not widely known.I'm thinking we can cross the $150 mark later this fall........perhaps even reach $160."
Melt up underway...still has a shot at $80 by mid-month....and low triple digit take-out price thereafter. Awaiting updated data and partner comments---BeiGene and BMY.
Mirati Therapeutics is up 5.53% to 156.07
Glad I got some at $9 in premarket
Still 52.25.. might go well below that. What’s the reason for this btw?
Lol this is a one way stock.. Up
Shorted this scam covering below $6.00 today.
Is there any evidence on how mrtx's kras compares to Amgens? Amgen's drug seems to have set a pretty high bar with very good tolerability and is a year ahead. So what makes you think MRTX can win?
MRTX could be taken out in the next few months...especially after today's ARRY news (Pfizer buyout).
"With the options activity I think things will be strong in the coming weeks, In the meantime I am watching this one too. https://alldaytrading.market/StockFeature"
"Following the Guggenheim ""Fireside Chat""/Conference/Presentation, an institution opted to recirculate about 500-600k shares (kind of a ""sell on the news"" event), MRTX shot up to a penny short of $76, then ""retreated"" as the seller took advantage of a price opportunity above $73 (good for him) before stabilizing as longer-term oriented buyers came in this afternoon.We may have a bit more ""stabilization"" on Monday and perhaps for another day or two thereafter but the info conveyed at the FC (Fireside Chat) just confirms my impression that we are still headed higher and perhaps may be ""in play"" at some point as multiple catalysts come into focus. Check the slide deck from the ""chat"" to see the several opportunities on the horizon.Have a nice weekend."
"Marati (MRTX) wants to go higher....holding well in a sick market.Furthermore, I believe MRTX will do very, very well in 2019....doubling at least (from $40 level)"
"Keep in mind that MRTX is a very, very ""thin"" stock which means that even relatively small buy and sell orders can trigger outsized moves. When you back out insider and institutional shareholdings, there are very few shares (relatively speaking) in the float. So we have large ups and downs on an almost daily basis."
"come on ... really on ""no"" news..;-)"
"Go to Yahoo Chart and then under the chart, go to Indicators and select BOLLINGER BANDS. This shows you where a stock is going or landing. Chart shows its now going to 80.99 or even possibly 49.06 a share."
"The stock market is going to hell and MRTX is up!!! WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU??? MRTX IS A BUY!!! Yes, the news yesterday was bad, but the worst is over now and the stock could easily run back to $50!! But as for the rest of the market, be careful!"
'Unconfirmed responses' - what is that? stock will fall on this BS
Always amazed at biotechs. Offering at $13 and it goes up to $16.80. :-)
what goes up must come down
"A guy named Harry Boxer, who is a technician with a decent-sized following, has issued price targets for MRTX. (I do not subscribe to his service...so what I'm passing along should be considered ""hearsay."") I believe I read or heard that he issued a target for MRTX to hit the mid $40's; if so, that may account for today's pullback. I still hold to the belief that this company has good management, a partnership with BeiGene and some great possible drugs in the pipeline that address lung cell cancer with promising early stage data. They also have very recognizable institutional support which, to me, is usually a good sign of acceptance."
"Yesterday saw some traders exit MRTX (which has been the strongest small biotech among the 40+ names I monitor in the space) to move to under-performing biotechs to try playing catch-up.Everything appears to be fine with MRTX and I expect it to continue to be a leader among small biotechs, especially with a couple of updates scheduled for early fall.As they say, this small hick-up shall pass."
"Shorts negative report on $FGEN is burning now same will happen in $AMRN next week, like $MDGL $AALK $MRTX and $RETA booom, this sector is recovering"
"Chart appears to have completed a somewhat sloppy ""cup with handle"" pattern. If so, a breakout to new highs would appear to be on deck and ready to go very soon."
Shorts having a little fun. They will cover after lunch. When the big guys get back. After all this is lung cancer cure.

is there any news?
"Mirati has a lot of promising irons in the fire. It might pay for anyone seriously interested in the longer-term potential of this company to listen to today's presentation by Charles Baum, CEO. The accompanying slide deck is also very helpful.I always hesitate to suggest that this is one to put away for a couple of years but, in this case, with readouts beginning in the next few months, plus additional development work....and possible label expansions on the horizon, this could well be a stock to put away for a few years.I am also impr5essed with the relationship they nave with BeiGene. Baum goes into some extended detail about the nature and prospects for that relationship in the presentation....which I also found very helpful."
"Headlines from this morning's MRTX Press Release are very encouraging. See the rest of the release for details.To me, this could get MRTX shares well over $225 in the near term....and higher thereafter as word spreads about the possible implications for this set of drug treatments for several cancers.Mirati Therapeutics Reports Investigational Adagrasib (MRTX849) Preliminary Data Demonstrating Tolerability and Durable Anti-Tumor Activity as well as Initial MRTX1133 Preclinical DataSun, October 25, 2020, 10:45 AM EDT- 45% confirmed ORR and 96% DCR across Phase 1/1b and Phase 2 monotherapy cohorts in patients with advanced NSCLC- Median duration of treatment >8 months with 50% of patients and 83% of responders still on treatment in the Phase 1/1b monotherapy cohort in patients with advanced NSCLC- Well-tolerated safety profile across monotherapy and combination trials- Initial preclinical data for MRTX1133, the Company's potential first-in-class KRAS G12D selective inhibitor, demonstrate significant tumor regression in mutant animal models; IND filing planned for 1H 2021"
"Mick: To try to answer your questions. Lung cancer is a very tough disease to treat/conquer. So far, the drugs available to do so are proving to be inadequate and MRTX's offering, while still in early development, shows some significant promise of bettering what's out there.....so, investing in MRTX becomes, among other things, a lottery ticket on whether they will continue to show better than current treatment options being offered....and, at some point, perhaps gain accelerated approval to bring their drug to market early.What also intrigues me is that there is significant and very strong institutional ownership of MRTX, including a handful of institutions whom I monitor carefully....and they seem heavily invested in MRTX....as well as willing, in most cases, to up their holdings of MRTX when the company does as offering as they just did.Final point: I also find it interesting/significant that the recent offering was done at $38.85 and, immediately thereafter, the stock spiked by more than 20%. The company's overall capitalization even after this recent offering is still relatively modest compared to many other development stage bios that I follow.I will certainly agree with you that if future trials fail to show a competitive edge, then MRTX would be a great short.So, at the end of the day, you pay your money and you take your pick---long or short.Good luck to you"
Message to shorts. Nice try but it’s not working for you guys.Later
"MRTX is a $1.6 B market cap company with what may well turn out to be a game-changing drug to treat lung cancer disease where many have tried and most have less than decent results. When I look at the institutional support here, venBio and Boxer Capital to name two heavyweights, and the ease with which capital raises have been done, I get a very good feeling that this company may be on the cusp of being more successful than many other companies in that space."
Any word on how the HC Wainwright conference went? Nothing posted anywhere about it. No links.
"My guess is that the deal has closed and been priced pretty close to $195, thereby affording all participation institutions a nice first-day bump. I'm sure we'll soon be informed."

"BLAIR: #AACR21 $INCY $AGEN $MRTX $ITOS Abstract Highlights and Meeting ItineraryOn Saturday, April 10, through Thursday, April 15, the American Association of CancerResearch (AACR) will host the first of two week-long virtual conferences, with the second tobe hosted on Monday, May 17, through Friday, May 21. Full regular abstracts were posted tothe AACR meeting website on March 10 with clinical trial and late-breaking abstracts to bereleased at the start of the conference, and in this note we highlight several important datapresentations for our coverage list and other data of interest. In addition, an itinerary of allrelevant presentations to our coverage list and the wider oncology landscape is appended atthe end of this note.In particular, we highlight:• Incyte (INCY $83.18; Outperform) will be providing the first clinical update with thecompany’s A2A/A2B receptor inhibitor and hosting a conference call with investors(on Monday, April 12) to discuss the company’s broader adenosine targeting strategy,including a CD73 antibody. The adenosine pathway has garnered significant industryinterest, and therapies targeting this pathway have led to monotherapy responses,although clear clinical development paths have yet to be established, in our opinion.• The next data point for TIGIT antibodies will come from iTeos (ITOS $34.54), which willpresent preliminary Phase I data with EOS884448 as a monotherapy. Recent managementcommentary suggests pharmacodynamic effects of EOS884448 will be focused on theperiphery for the AACR presentation, with biopsy analysis coming later in the year. Recallother TIGIT antibodies have shown minimal activity as a monotherapy, with the mostapparent benefit coming when combined with PD-(L)1 antibodies in PD-L1–positivepatients. The company will also host an investor call on Monday, April 12.• Agenus (AGEN $2.89; Outperform) will provide an update from the ongoing trialevaluating the combination of AGEN1181, a next-generation CTLA-4 antibody withFc enhancements, and balstilimab, the company’s PD-1 antibody. As of February, thecompany reported a 23% response rate (5/22 patients), achieving responses in tumorsunlikely to respond to PD-(L)1 antibody monotherapy, including microsatellite stablecolorectal and endometrial cancers. We will host a call with Agenus management onSaturday, April 10, to discuss the updated results (see page 5 for registration link).• Although mainly preclinical in nature, several companies will provide updates on KRASG12C inhibitors, attempting to improve on the results presented to date by Amgen(AMGN $249.10; Market Perform) and Mirati (MRTX $173.91). In particular, the abstractsfocus on proposed combination regimens, with preclinical efficacy reported for severalcombinations targeting the MAPK pathway.AgenusAgenus will present updated clinical data with the company’s novel Fc-enhanced CTLA-4 antibody, AGEN1181, for which thecompany has previously disclosed multiple confirmed responses as monotherapy and in combination with the PD1 antibodybalstilimab. As of the most recent update, the combination of AGEN1181 and balstilimab resulted in a 23% response rate(5/22) across a variety of tumor types, including many that would not be expected to respond to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, suchas microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) and MSS endometrial cancer. These particularly tough-to-treat cancertypes do not respond to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, making the initial data for AGEN1181 combination more impressive. Two MSSendometrial cancer patients have achieved responses, one on monotherapy AGEN1181 and a second on the combination withbalstilimab. In addition, a confirmed partial response in an MSS CRC patient treated with the combination was also announcedin February of this year. We continue to be encouraged by the safety profile of the drug and initial biomarker and efficacy data,and look forward to additional updates at the upcoming AACR meeting"
This last hour could be interesting. It appears we will clearly establish a new high (at least over the past several months).
KA-BOOM. AMGN KRAS news boosting MRTX big t5ime.Could be in big pharma's sights
this is phase 2 data not phase 1..70+ percent tumor reduction in one patient..that is amazing folks
"Just a little ""test of the water"" above $18....Stock not quite ready for that move yet....back to $17.50ish and some churn. $23-25 still looks good by March '18. Company should have some decent data out before then......"
Looks like another Clovis
A close above $34.95 will represent a new 2+ year closing high. Looks like we're about to get that. Volume could be a bit better....but there's been quite a bit of stock accumulated over the past couple of weeks.
Don’t understand no revenue no big or good news yet it is over $100
MRTX reached a new All Time High at 63.20
Same action and price drop as SGEN but both have quickly gained back 18 bucks. You just can't freak out with these mood swings that all bio stocks go through. Hang in there and average down.
It's all over...After hours: 5:32PM EST 14.00 -1.50 (-9.68%)
Do they wholly own their pipeline or licensed it out?
"I can't tell you if the breakout above $110 will happen today but it sure looks to me like we are very, very close to breaking out into new high ground............"
MRTX is down 25.43% to $29.83
"For MRTX to achieve comparability with ARRY's recent acquisition price by Pfizer, the shares would have to reach approximately $162....yes, $162....and, that's my ""guess"" as to a current takeout price. Time will tell and we will see....but the recent MRTX price action suggest it may well be on someone's active radar."
Still going down. Anyone knows will it recover today ?
In fact it’s nothing more than bioscam. No product no business no revenue. Cash burning machine bullsht study.
Loading up for next Tuesday. It's gonna be big.
"Perhaps this bounce marks a legit bottom....after how many ""dead cat"" bounces."
"Interesting trading last few days. $1.07M shares traded today, double the average. Mirati will have to either partner with a Major Pharma Oncology Company or be acquired in order to complete with Amgen that has both the lead and an army of sales reps. Merck, Roche, Bristol and Abbvie are my best guess. Will they wait for approval or get moving now not to lose anytime to Amgen?"
"I bought this one a long time ago at 5, sold at 5.5 for 50 cent profit. It hen sunk to 3. I was so glad I was out. Then it roar from 3 to 110 in a few years. Who knows what happens next now. Well it may do it again. Be cared full with your pocket. Wolf knew everything"
Mirati Therapeutics is up 5.65% to 167.65
It was a 2 penny per share stock in 2013 when it did reverse stock split (50/1).
I hope I am wrong but today's reversal is not good at all.
Something very large looming on the near-term horizon. Somebody wants in...now and big-time.
and that explains why the SP has been dropping. there's so much leak and trading on insider info.
MRTX is down 7.48% to $43.10
You know the secondary is days away. This company needs cash and they needed it BAD.
"The MRTX SCAM is over... The product was announced as a failure today and is being shuttered.. All you pumpers deserved to lose your shirt on this no-product / no-earnings / nothing-to-show company that quadrupled in price on a single comment that phase II trials look favorable.. Define favorable? You mean ""nobody died after taking the pill (yet) but there were no other results"" ???"
"From Michelle Solly:Keeping an eye on a new fund, launched in Aug 2019, Logos Global!The team is formerly of Farallon and Versant, with ~$400m AUM (from 13F)They had their first filing! Top positions:$MRTX (8.06%)$SRPT (7.19%)$ASND (6.17%)$AMRN (5.09%)$APLS (4.43%)"
Watch this reach $90 in the next couple of days with the catalysts on the table
Anything under $75.50 looks like a good entry point. Significant data readouts coming over the next 2 quarters.
Mirati Therapeutics is up 5.31% to 173.02
"Lots of new and exciting expansive data being released and discussed....if you own MRTX or have an interest, you should listen to today's presentation."
going back up to 6.00
"Investment bankers have been known to drop share prices (by shorting, etc.) just before an offering/secondary to bring the share price down to a ""more attractive"" level so that their institutional friends can get aboard at a bargain price. My own view from monitoring and owning quite a few biotechs is that this current sector selloff has amounted to an approximate 8-10% correction. If you apply this metric to MRTX and add in another 5% drop due to the expected dilution from this offering, from MRTX's recent high of $132, this stock should be ""fairly valued"" at $112 to $115....so, if they sell this offering to their institutional friends at $98 (or thereabouts), these buyers are essentially picking up a free $14 to $17 ""gift.""It's the way the game is played. I'm still holding....but, at least, I now understand why the sharp share price drop occurred."
Good to see a good old fashioned short stomping in the early stages!
MRTX is down 7.41% to 119.31
"I was a bit early with a prior price target but, after ""kissing"" $130 and pulling back to around $116, it now appears that MRTX is ready to resume its advance. While comments on the coming earnings release may catalyze the move, I'm of the view that $140 is on the horizon for sometime in September."
"Spike open today...probably short covering. Hasty retreat to close the gap....further consolidation at a higher price.MRTX simply has to be one of the very best acting stocks in the entire market...If you check out their presentations, consider the company's market cap, I think you'll see that they are very active in several potential blockbuster indications.....much of which is still not discounted by the current share price.Furthermore, venBio has a decent position here and their deal with BeiGene earlier this year has effectively set the stage for quicker to market opportunities."
"Overall MRTX gets a fundamental rating of 4 out of 10. We evaluated MRTX against 496 industry peers in the Drugs industry. While MRTX has a great health rating, its profitability is only average at the moment. While showing a medium growth rate, MRTX is valuated expensive at the momentNote: MRTX has only limited data available, so a full analysis was not possible, which makes the total rating unfair."
Go to $14
"I had a sneaking suspicion that MRTX was setting up for an offering...just the way the share price was climbing on relatively low volume---a sure sign that a market maker was pumping it up to try for a better price....plus the company's cash base needed some infusion.If you read the release regarding the offering, no mention of amount to be offered---another strange twist.FWIW, I still own a decent slug of shares but wish I had unloaded a few more before today's mangled news release."
Looks like OS will be long- Good news!
"Oct. 28-29 will be key days for MRTX. I expect great data, especially relative to AMGN's KRAS ""competitive"" drug in this space. Looking for key differentiation."
Today's press release portends good news to be shared in about a week.
Hi Just want to know why $mrtx dropped today
"$mrtx was under 3, 3 years ago. Now it's over 200 on good kras data for lung cancer. I had similar dreams stock price dreams for $agen when I made my first purchase in 2017. Now I just dream of $agen staying above $4 lol. God dammit."
"The last few days had all the earmarks of an institutional liquidation.Time to buy at $188-$190....for data reports later this quarter. Needless to say, I'm optimistic here."
catalyst-rich biotechhttps://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/19/10/14579904/biotech-stock-on-the-radar-assessing-miratis-oncology-franchise-with-an-eye-on-multiple-readouts
"Any stock that can hold up this well...or advance as we have done (at least so far) today must have something really exciting on the horizon....but there I go again, repeating myself."
MRTX reached a new All Time High at 55.25
"New all-time closing high this week: Highest daily, weekly and since-IPO (in 2013) closing price.....very nice."
Cleaned out a few stops on the mini shake a short while ago and back up we go
3.8 million dollars call option today on flowalgo at 339pm 220 call options 2300 purchased. Feeling like this stock going higher very soon
I predict we will have a daily high over 100 today
"With many/most small bios, it's not profitability that drives their share prices in their formative years; it's their pipelines, indications, management teams....and the expectations of either a take out or go-it-alone profitability as their pipelines play out.MRTX has a great shot at a NSCLC treatment that may prove to be a game-changer....but only time will tell as trials play out."
Sell today and buy back when it cools off. Still a long way to go.
Anyone?
MRTX ran from $36 to $46 and back to $36 over last 3 weeks....setup for offering (probably to be priced at $39). MRTX has some great science and the extra cash will insure the full flushout of their pipeline in lung cell cancer. They have a great mgt. team and i believe they will be successful in one or more indications. The offering has already been discounted.....and i believe this will be a 3-5 bagger in 2-3 years.
"MRTX appears ready to have a meaningful upward move. Hopefully, it will take out former high, make a new base and move onward from there. I'm thinking $40 in this move by end of May."
Look for initial Kras data to post at 4:25 p.m. E.T. Monday
"First take on the MRTX data dump today. It's still early but, based upon a very small patient sample, we would appear to be equal to, or perhaps better than AMGN's KRAS drug which, to me, is a win as it says we're in the game in a serious way.Still, MRTX has more work to do...and subsequent data for both MRTX and AMGN could move the needle meaningfully in our favor (or against us if future reads do not confirm our preliminary data). AMGN, if I'm not mistaken, has been given a fast-track pathway to approval....and we also should be given similar concessions....as the more robust data for both companies unfolds, one may be a more clear winner....but the data confirmations are patient-dependent and will read out several quarters from now.I like our odds. We're the little engine that could and our market cap vs AMGN in KRAS-related indications/solutions is minuscule and, with further improvement in our data, our upside will be quite large. Someone posted $200 as a price target. That may eventually happen but, in the near-term, I'm happy to be ""in play"" with our data and will await next readouts....who knows how far we may go...but I have a feeling it's a long way....right now, $200 looks good. :-)"
"MRTX CEO to speak today at JP Morgan Healthcare conference, a very well-attended Wall Street institutional hang-out early in the new year.Having hit my $50 price target earlier than my estimated January month-end, my latest thoughts lead me to conclude that, while we have several read-outs scheduled for the first half and lots going on with Bei-Gene our partner in Asia-developmental activities, I expect us to make a new high by mid-year and possibly achieve an $80 price point. Still, this remains a longer-term play out story.Current fully diluted market cap sits at $2.25 B and I think that substantially undervalues the pipeline....venBio and Baker Brothers are key holders."
The bankers desperately want to close the stock above the offering price of the secondary....make the customers happy.
"This is a quiet board, but maybe someone can give me a sincere opinion about why MRTX is trading at $48. I realize the cancer market offers huge potential, but there’s so much competition in the space. I took a look at the MRTX website and noticed the pipeline is small, no products in the market, and no trials beyond Phase 2. I hold no position but with no malice it sure looks like a prime company to short."
Definitely worth a read: https://fdaheadlines.com/questions-arise-around-mirati-therapeutics-inc-nasdaqmrtx-esmo-data/
MRTX very soon more than 200 ! And with the FDA aprob to the moon
$AFMD should be currently worth at least double/triple to that of $MRTX considering AFM24 is independent of EGFR signaling and mutational status and not limited to just KRAS mutations.
"If you really want to get a good picture/insight into why I believe MRTX will be a big winner over the coming five years (unless,of course, big pharma sees what I see and steps in at an attractive price), then you should listen to Chris McMasters's talk at the June 8 Jefferies conference.....21 minutes of well-articulated commentary on the several pathways forward for this company"
"Wow Big offering! Watching this one, I'll grab some shares if it sells off."
Watch the share price today for a hint about the strength of the upcoming data release. Someone always seems to know in advance.
"Insane markets.Everything are NEGATIVE on MRTX statistics, No profit margin , no earning, negative EBITDA. Not profitable at all.Why is the reason for pumping this stock? I don't get it . I am trying to figure out why this stock is going to the roof,WHY?"
When is mrtx expected to release their data? Thx
Very good news. Let's see the impact today and if it will lead to more institutional buying.
This stock will be down tomorrow.
This could easily see $15 by eod.
"Nice to see a positive reaction....as MRTX has held up very, very well during the recent market correction.I think there's a bigger story behind this one....if we just allow it to play out."
"Just thinking that there may be something quite significant about to be discussed at the upcoming three investor conferences scheduled for March 14th, 15th and 20th. Rather unusual to hit the road and do three presentations so close together.Maybe I'm wrong....but I do find this to be interesting."
"I think today's rise can be attributed to positive commentary from Amgen (AMGN) indicating some better results with their KRAS drug.As most here know, MRTX offers a more pure play on KRAS than does AMGN....it will be ""interesting"" to see what happens when MRTX finally (and, hopefully, in the near future) offers an update on their KRAS compound. I would expect good results....and a sharp and further upward revaluation of MRTX at that time."
THIS WILL GO UP UP AND UP
Old high of $80...and old closing high of $78.65 about to be taken out....or so it appears to me.
BLRX--just had a press release similar to MRTXs back in 2017 when MRTX was 5--BLRX ph3 stunning data under 4 bucks---buy in for ride to 200 like mrtx did over 4 years
"If it's any consolation (I say, talking to myself) MRTX had two larger percentage corrections: late in 2018 and early in 2020. Based upon the magnitude of those setbacks, we 'appear' to be close to the end of this one (he mumbles to himself)."
"Harold: I believe you are wrong with your basic thesis. Yes, investing has its risks and, yes, there are some scams perpetrated on the unwary and unwise investors and, yes, perhaps one or more of the companies you listed are scams....but I'll let the SEC determine that.If you cannot accept the risk that goes with investing in stocks (especially in areas like biotechnology) perhaps you should either hire a professional, index all your funds or simply put your money in CDs.I specifically disagree on MRTX, a company on which I have done my homework. I believe it will be successful....but, as I've said previously, there are no guarantees.....and that's why I own 6-7 biotechs. I fully expect one or two may go under but the overall group will do well.I hope this helps you in some small way to understand why outfits like the Baker Brothers, venBio, NEA associates and many others play in this arena.My final point is to commend the trained people who have the courage to start companies to try to cure diseases or minimize their effects, knowing that failure will have them looking for work elsewhere. Many will fail but, thankfully, some will succeed and you and I and our families and friends will be better off because of their efforts."
SunTrust just released a note stating that a series of strong data catalysts&disruptive medicines being commercialized or entering the clinic they recommend investors being overweight biotech. Their recommendations are:$CRSP $BMRN $CBAY $EDIT $EXEL $INCY$MRTX$RARE $SAGE $SRPT $VKTX $WVEOur time is coming - just be patient.
Action for next week? Should go slightly higher?
Off the wall profits? That’s what I am making with THESTOCKDORK (search Google now)
downgrade coming within a week.
"The BBs filed purchase, in my opinion, by itself simply cannot be the entire reason for today's move. I suspect there is something else going on which has yet to be announced. Perhaps some significant data on Mirati's KRAS drug has been leaked....or it might be a discussion of a buyout based upon confidential data shared with a potential acquirer.Anyone have something more specific?Thanks in advance."
"Fake, there was no conference today. I checked their website"
More promising data released over the weekend....just check the press release for specifics.
MRTX reached a new All Time High at 52.55
"Not at all surprised by this correction and, make no mistake, this is all we're seeing after a strong run. I would imagine, what with key readouts in a few months, we may do some further consolidating between $60 and $80.Nice to have two upcoming presentations later this month to add a touch more clarity to prospects ahead. With decent data, a buyout is still a very strong and realistic possibility....but we'll see.Cheers."
Downfall accelerating
"Heavy institutional demand for this offering. Couple of noteworthy points suggest that:1) The closing was announced a mere 5 hours after the offering was announced.2) The offering announcement itself stated the raise would be $75 MM. The closing announcement stated $100 MM was raised.This was clearly not a ""retail"" piece of business. For whatever that's worth.."
"BBs filed today with a large MRTX position add. After hours up strongly. Tomorrow could/ should be ""interesting."""
"I know you won’t believe me, but I bought 1700 shares at 10.70. My biggest winner ever."
KALA heavy insiders buying could rocket like $ALLK $MRTX $RETA $SGEN $ACAD $CLVS
If it stays over $100 what might the nov 80 calls be worth tomorrow? They closed at 11.25
I was reminded that today is options expiration day.
"The all-time Mirati closing high was $76.65 on Feb 27th, 2019 We have a good shot to take that out today if we get a decent late Friday afternoon push......if not, I think it'll happen early next week.BTW, if you get a chance, listen to Dr. Baum and see the slide deck that accompanied his presentation at the Cowen Healthcare Conference earlier this week. Baum was laser-focused in his comments....and the slide deck was the best yet from Mirati."
"Shorts had no fun on Friday, actually they took it in the shorts. Good to see!"
"positive data but it drop $6, why"
"It appears that we've about finished some sideways consolidation...though with today's pre-market indicators showing red, MRTX may stay in the bullpen for a few more days."
"If you can stand volatility, Mirati is one for you.Seriously though, there is oft-times a correlation between volatility and successful high-growth companies. I think the future for Mirati remains outstanding. Slow or low or no growers tend to trade in rather narrow windows while the rockets gyrate like crazy."
Hi Mark. What's the story here? Uptick after hours too. Thoughts?
"$AFMD $MRTXthe next ""big"" biotech stocks"
Bought it at $22 based on momentum. Turns out to be a great company too
"It is becoming more apparent and confirmed by the volume of the last 2 days that the bottom, as I thought and posted a few days ago, is in.With some upcoming conferences and presentations, I am optimistic that we will soon be looking at some very promising data. I did also see that Pfizer recently introduced a small lung cell drug with promising potential. Not coincidentally, Charles Baum, MRTX's CEO spent many years at Pfizer focusing on nSCLC....interesting to say the least."
VSTM it’s time to accumulate shares KRAS is huge look at $MRTX and $AMGN much bigger than $TRIL and $FTRV cd47
"MRTX just announced an offering of less than 1% of total shares outstanding. Investment bankers dropped share price to accommodate demand for the deal....which was probably already pre-sold to meet demand of institutional guys who wanted in, especially after yesterday's data announcement. We should be back over $200 soon....."
"New all-time closing high today...amd likely going higher, much higher.But do your own checking. MRTX has a lot of irons in the fire....Bei-Gene, BMY, KRAS leadership position."
This should get interesting now
MRTX's near-term (by end on January) price target now $52.
"Relative to the ""spike move"" last week, MRTX shares experienced a very tight (and apparently short-lived) correction enabling the stock to regain strength for its next upward movement...which, in pre-market activity, it appears might be starting this morning.The activity reminds me of an Indy car...perhaps a poor analogy...But Indy cars go at high speed, stop for very short ""pit stops"" and take off again like rockets. Hmmmm, maybe not a bad comparison."
This will reach 200.Dont know why
"AND....here we go !!!!!!!!!!!!My, my..............."
"Today may be a reversal day. Lower open, higher volume and a close at or near day's high and above yesterday's closeQuite a shake we had."
"MRTX makes all time closing high while outperforming all bio indices over the past six, 12 and 24 months.Oh, wait, there a ""Fireside Chat"" scheduled for tomorrow (11:20 A.M. EST) so I'm guessing we'll get some decent news updates.....What will it be?????????????"
We hit the second century mark ($200) in fairly short time. It now falls to the data to get us to the third century mark....I'm optimistic.
"Finally.....a breath of air...let's see how long this attempted rebound lasts. I've been long for several years, believe in this science and am NOT going away."
Mirati Therapeutics is down 5.75% to 162.35
Lots of air underneath this priceGaps get filed unless there is a material financial event
MRTX is up 8.92% to 55.55
"Three (3) investor conferences in the next two (2) weeks should be highly beneficial to MRTX's story getting wider attention.Albert said $40 a few days ago and, unofficially, I thought that was a rather rich assumption. Now, I'm not so sure.The keys to MRTX's success will be the coming readouts on its drug trials....good news....and we easily get to (or past) $40.Crossing all fingers for Baum telling his assembled investors and analysts what's in store down the road.There are some big players in MRTX stock...so they either know something....or think they know something."
Undervalued stocks.......back $30's
I was here about 2 years ago..when MRTX was hovering between $11 and $15.Well dont tell me that was a fake one...:) I sold it at $60!! This year Im waiting for my other pick to take off for similar gains...thats VERI. Good luck to all
$MRTX still up 500% with no sales yet should move some to $AMRN and NBRV
"Au contraire QASIMI....Bollinger bands are tightening....data on the horizon on a few readouts before end of year (sorry, nothing more specific at this time...but AMGN's readout and share price reaction suggests MRTX may have some excellent data to report), biotechs are due for a rise (anyone see SGEN today?), and MRTX is a possible takeover target....I originally suggested fair value to be about $160/share."
What’s going to happen today ?
MRTX about to pop to $120 ++ in next two weeks. Good trade opportunity.
Deal priced at $202....all sides win with aggressive pricing.
"Think about this if you're interested in KRAS impact.MRTX has a market cap of about 3.8 B while AMGN has a market cap of $123 B.If one assumes that the KRAS takedown will be $ 5 B in revenues at some point in the future, that will represent 131 % of MRTX's current capitalization....but only 4 % of AMGN's current capitalization.It's obvious what the impact of success in KRAS-related drugs will mean to two of the primary movers in that space."
"This equity analyst sees big things coming for $MRTX and others in 2019:""Deciphera’s $DCPH Phase III top line reads out at ASCO, Mirati’s competitor Amgen (NASDAQ:$AMGN) will likely present clinical data on its KRAS inhibitor at ASCO and Mirati clinical data likely at ESMO, or European Society for Medical Oncology. Scientists have been trying for the last two to three decades to come up with a targeted KRAS inhibitor, and it finally looks like Mirati and Amgen have cracked the code. Any positive updates from Amgen will likely be read as positive for Mirati.BerGenBio has second-line lung cancer and second-line AML — acute myeloid leukemia — data at ASCO. Celyad $CYAD is also presenting mature Phase I data in AML and colorectal cancer, Neon $NTGN will be presenting 52-week mature data in melanoma and lung cancer at ASCO, and Forty Seven Inc. $FTSV will provide an update on mature Phase II data with 5F9 in relapse/refractory NHL.""https://www.twst.com/interview/clinical-data-and-ma-serve-as-catalysts-in-2019"
"This is a pathetic butchering of this secondary....the deal should have been pulled until market conditions improved.It also did not help to have two key management personnel walk...or be asked to leave....all rather cryptic in my book.On top of that, no one from the company can talk at this point since there is a financing under way.Even tho I'm a long-time shareholder, I give this whole orchestration a failing grade for being so poorly managed."
"$VSTM should play catch up to $MRTX KRAS worth $3.8B and $AMGN , a nice partnership is welcome"
Raid back to 5..take a wile though
Anyone else thinking this looks like a nice short?
"I believe that the data on Mirati's KRAS inhibitor was somewhat more robust than AMGN's even tho AMGN received FDA OK today. If MRTX delivers updated data sets and can keep their early data intact, they should be able to take first place in this race.....though I'll admit AMGN really had the muscle to get their data out pretty fast."
anyone still here from 4 - 5 $ per share price?
"I was right about MRTX, and look for ADAP tomorrow!"
Where can you find the best plays from across the markets? ExplosiveOTC consistently uncovers the hidden gems before they break out. www.explosiveotc.com
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAg hahaahahah hahahahahah yahahahaua                 
"Apparently, MRTX has decided to move up on an overall down day.....interesting way to garner attention.BTW, in the recent offering, some of the ""big boys"" of biotech got aboard...or added. Both are good signs."
"The category for a KRAS inhibitor has been ""blessed"" by the FDA....lead dog is AMGN.....MRTX now has to show that their drug is inherently better."
"Looks like a small volume shake following a ""disappointing"" earnings release (larger than expected loss). I was more disappointed that, apparently, there is no CC to discuss things...but the earnings report and accompanying presentation cover most of the expected ground....still, a little ""color"" from mgt. is always appreciated.I'm long....but not adding....or selling."
Endocyte just bought out at a 50% premium to yesterday's close. ECYT's largest shareholder is venBio. Baker Bros. also a holder. Both venBio and Baker Bros have larger positions in MRTX.....just sayin'
"In my experience trading in and out of MRTX, it has always been highly manipulated. Radical swings up and down. Good luck to longs but I really can’t see it holding a 12% gain based solely on the Baker Bros news, so I’ve gone short. Thus far today I regret that decision, but let’s see what happens over the next few days"
Why down?
"KA-BOOM---just blew past my end of January $50 target.Soon will be speaking at the JP Morgan bio conference. New partnership with BMY (which is in the process of acquiring CELG), has experienced management, a few unique pipeline assets in cancer, small capitalization. Baker Bros and ven-Bio are ownersWhat's not to like?Is there a deal on the horizon? Stay tuned."
Back in my naive days I thought the SEC would look at companies like this that blatantly leak pertinent information to select stock holders that subsequently profit handsomely at the expense of the common shareholder. Now it appears everyone just shrugs their shoulders and accept it as routine behavior by the well connected. Welcome to our deregulated future.
"It'll be interesting to see when the fund positions are revealed 45 days post end of Q1 (around May15) which one or ones blinked, panicked and sold in the past week or so.This does look like MRTX has put in the bottom for this cycle....time will of course tell us if that's right...or just another head fake."
MRTX reached an all time high at 114.00
