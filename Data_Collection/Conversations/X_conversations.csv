"This stock is going to double from here.""Were entering 2022 in a great position to both create value for our stockholders and deliver value to our customers. We are executing a robust contract process with customers, in most instances, having begun discussions 90 days sooner than we have historically. Our strategy is paying dividends. Assuming the forward curve, which we believe to be a pessimistic view of spot prices, we fully expect average selling prices to be higher in 2022 than 2021 for our Flat-rolled segment. Weve also listened to our customers and in some instances, have signed agreements beyond 12 months."""
Yahoo says downward trend in stock price between now and next nine months? This is FUBAR.
US Steel is making more profit per share per quarter than Apple is in a year. It shows how over priced tech is right now. X will be a major safe haven during the next downturn.
"CNBC just talked about the chip shortage in the auto industry easing up. They married that conversation to what X was saying about demand increasing. Have to remember that approximately 2,000 lbs of steel are in each car manufactured. All roads point to share price of X continuing to do very well here especially in the short-term, highly undervalued."
"I am thankful to GS ,MS for the opportunity to add at dip of $20.50 up to $24.80.My average is in $14.80 .bought from $7 to $12 then added at $17 when X issued shares . I am in good shape now and have plenty of patience."
"Total shares outstanding are about 270 million. Some 70 % of the shares are held by institutions and hedge funds. These shares won’t be available for the shorts. Leaves some 80 million shares available. Good part of these are owned by small investors, which also unlikely available. Shorts total 55 million. Shorts have a problem. They may be able to manipulate the AH trading, tomorrow may be a different story. A nice squeeze and soon is not impossible. We should see $30 and further North soon.Annualize this quarter and the P/E is virtually 1. Something will have to give."
"So, for the first 9 months of 2021, $X has earned a $11.13/share or non-gaap of $9.99/share. This isn't EBITDA, this is NET EARNINGS! Amazing. And this stock is at $25?! with P/E of 2.5 not even including earnings for the upcoming quarter. This should be a $100 stock in any other industry."
"Here come the upgrades and price target increases. Seriously, if GS and MS change their stance and give a realistic analysis of this company, then this will really take off. How can they ignore these profits? They can't hold this down any further."
"Just checking in now and as I suspected, a fantastic beat on both ends. I highly suspect we will here some more good news too come on phone conference call. The ones who are in it for fast money will be selling soon, a day or two. I'm in this for bigger bucks and will tuck my shares away for a year or two. I very confident this will be a 3 digit stock by then. Good luck everyone in your investing."
"Many investors today are new to investing. Looking at a balance sheet or income statement can be difficult to understand, process, or to compare. I'd like to explain in an easy to understand way.First, when you buy a share, you are investing in a company. Companies exist to make a profit. Sure some will try to sell you by making you think you are buying into a lifestyle or investing in the future of saving our planet, space travel, or a new reality. When you break it all down it comes down to profit.Today US Steel announced how well they did over the last quarter. This is their report card over the last 3 months. To sum up USS' report card:Total Profit=$1.5billion ($5.36 per share)Most companies keep that profit to reinvest back into the company.USS just announced that they are wanting to give back to the shareholders.They are giving back $56million ($0.05 per share quarterly, or $0.20 annually)They are also buying back shares to help raise the price of the stock over the next quarter. This amounts to $300million or $1.07 per share They also said they are reducing their debt that they've been paying close to 9%APR from $7 billion to $3.9 billion by the end of this year. That will be a savings of $300million per year or $1.07/share.If that's still confusing look at this:You buy a share today at $26.40You get $.05/qtr back in dividends ($.20/year)The stock's value rises $1.07/qtr due to stock buy backs ($4.28/year)The company pays off $billions of debt from their profit saving $1.07/qtr ($4.28/year)Hopefully this helps when comparing companies that you are interested in buying."
"Tim on CNBC Fast Money on Friday uttered a short sentence, "" HOW ABOUT THOSE US STEEL NUMBERS"". Finally getting some recognition."
If you believe in the future then you will know that indeed Bitcoin is the future investment that can help you achieve your future goal
At this point it seems more likely this stock going to $50 than back down to $20. It's hysterical how well this company is doing. And now dividend increase and stock buybacks? This is everything you could want in a company.
"I am now denoting myself as an analyst. I am upgrading X to a Quadruple BUY and 3 month price target of $50, 6 month target of $100, and 1 year target of $200. The stock is severely undervalued, Management is making all the right moves. It is my belief that other analysts who downgraded X did so without any knowledge of common sense. The steel industry is gaining more momentum every day, and is far from peak. We see many years of very strong demand throughout all avenues that involve steel. X is positioned as the leader of the pack as Management continues to execute at a tremendous level. The balance sheet has massive strength which allows management to raise the dividend and buyback stock to increase shareholder value. Their debt has reversed in just 2 quarters. We have never seen a company’s balance sheet transform so positively in just a small amount of time. With an infrastructure deal imminent, we can confidently predict MASSIVE earnings for years to come."
Do anyone know if part of the volume yesterday was the company doing the $300 million share buyback:)

"Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba slashed his rating on U.S. Steel by two notches, to ""underweight"", and nearly halved his price target on the group to $17 a share. He also revised price targets for Cleveland-Cliff (CLF) - Get Cleveland-Cliffs Inc Report, taking it to $21 from $26 per share, and Nucor (NUE) - Get Nucor Corporation Report, which he lowered to $105 per share from $115 per share. Stock Futures Slip, China Slows, Apple 'Unleashed', Delta-Plus Mutation - 5 Things You Must KnowEarlier this month, Goldman Sachs analyst Emily Chieng lowered her price target on the U.S. Steel to $21 a share, while cutting the group's rating to ""sell"" from ""neutral', in a major sector update for a near-term market correction as hot-rolled coil steel (HRC) prices are around 140% north of their historical levels this year, at around $1,500 per ton, driven by stronger industrial demand and a ""lagging supply response."""
The biggest knock on X is the new $3b investment...however looking at the Q2 call you can see that x actually idled 2 plants earlier this year so their overall utilization is about 59%. Clf actually bashed x for the new investment but they should be thanking x for idling two plants. Without the 2 idled plants utilization is at 85% to 90%+ So if demand increases going forward they can restart the idled plants but would be too costly. Overall EBiItda margins are at a record of 26% but the mini mill EAF margins are at 36% so the other margins are lowered than 26% Now consider x has $4b debt as of Q2. But with more than $1b expected for this reported and next quarter..that would he down to net debt of under $2b well below the debt to earnings of Clf. Now x will spend $3b over the next two years but I suppose they will also reduce their other cap ex so really the net increase in cap ex per year may just be $1b..easily covered by earnings in 2022 alone. The huge operating margins of the new mini mill will pay for itself. Now CLF was rewarded for their contracts that protect them but x also has contracts down the line...and will benefit tremendously from increases prices more so than clf so just a toss up on how steel prices move and stay higher for longer. I believe X is trying to get better and not just bigger as the idled plant shows. The huge margins out of the mini mills and their own iron ore stock will prove a winning combination if competitors lack scrap for their supplies. Anyway I think most in the steel industry will do well as evidenced by the stock buybacks by other companies. X just has to tell their story better. Most in the steel industry seem to know not to flood the markets but you can't fault x when their utilization is as high as it is. A little setback from the expansion plans but the investment should pay dividends down the road as steel demand goes even higher.
"Just read the X cc transcript. Sounds like management took some toast master classes. The transcript read like they knew what they were talking about. I was tempted to sell my shares today, but I think I will hold on to them."
