One advantage of DRIP plan buying lower than market price and it helps keep you i the game. Congrats!
I thought the 7% dividend increase would have pushed us a little higher today.
Any chance this company could be acquired? Thoughts? No idea here.seems like water will be extremely important down the road or do you think they might buy another water company which I think could be interesting.
"oldman Sachs Names 2 'Relatively Defensive' Water Utility Plays11:00am ET 4/16/2020 BenzingaMentioned in articleAWKWTRGWater utility stocks are trading at a premium valuation to electric and gas utilities, which seems justified given their longer depreciable life and visibility into above-average growth due to significant water pipe investment needs, according to Goldman Sachs.The American Water Works, Essential Utilities AnalystInsoo Kim said in a Wednesday note that water utilities have abundant growth opportunities in a fragmented market and their premium valuation appears sustainable, with continued environmental, social and governance momentum.American Water Works: Best-In-Class GrowthKim upgraded American Water Works Company Inc (NYSE: AWK) from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $134 to $146.The company hasÂ been generating best-in-class earnings growth of 8.3% and should continue to deliver above-average growth in the long term due to organic investments and municipal system acquisitions, the analyst said.Â American Water Works is the only large-cap, pure-play water utility and has an ESG-friendly status, he said.Tthe company has a stable balance sheet, which should continue to improve through 2022, according to Goldman Sachs.Â Essential Utilities: A Water-Gas MixThe Goldman Sachs analyst initiated coverage of Essential Utilities Inc (NYSE: WTRG) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target.Â The company, which was formed by the merger of Aqua America and Peoples Gas, is likely to generateÂ robust 6.6% earnings growth annually from 2019 to 2022, Kim said.TheÂ stock valuation already reflects these positives, the analyst said.Â Both American Water Works and Essential Utilities 'remain relatively defensive in the current COVID-19 environment,' he said.Â AWK, WTRG Price ActionAmerican Water Works shares were trading 1.99% higher at $131.78 at the time of publication Thursday, while Essential Utilities shares were up 1.67% at $42.70.Â Related Links:A Peek Into The Markets: US Stock Futures Gain Ahead Of Morgan Stanley EarningsStocks That Hit 52-Week Lows On MondayLatest Ratings for AWK DateFirmActionFromToApr 2020Goldman SachsUpgradesNeutralBuy Mar 2020UBSMaintainsNeutral Feb 2020BairdMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for AWK View the Latest Analyst Ratings 2020 Benzinga.com.

50.00/share a milestone that may be coming up or a split/ bottom line either share goes up or increasing dividend good for shareholders. Good luck to all.
"So I've seen several posts on here about how we are entering a water supply crisis, which i wholeheartedly agree with. However, is WTRG really the right company to make money off of that? In order for them to profit, they'd have to own water rights. As far as I know, they only own distribution and treatment systems. I suppose treatment systems will be in high demand as well but does anyone know if they hold water rights as well?Also, most countries are finally waking up to the fact that their infrastructure that was installed after WW2 is going to have to be replaced in the next decade. It might be worthwhile investing in some pipe manufacturers as well. As someone who works in the Civil Engineering field, I can tell you that small town USA is going to be experiencing a reckoning of infrastructure problems very soon."
The market is spooked on dividend paying stocks values because of the potential raise in interest rates. Utilities and bonds have been on the skids.
Not in love with this deal. I liked owning a water company. Now I own an energy company tied to wild swings in nat gas prices with a lot of debt.
What's with all the TV Ads? I live in SE Penna. For the last couple of weeks the CEO if Essential has done tons of TV advertisements on multiple channels about Aqua and Peoples gas. Peoples doesn't service this area. It looks like he running for office. Must be costing (wasting) millions of dollars for a utility that already has the customer base to do this. Anybody know what is going on?
When will they announce the increase and/or split this month???
"Why did we go down almost 5 1/2 % today? 3/31/20. End of the month thing? The S&P was only down 1.6%.I was depending on this stock to maintain it's price in a market down turn . Instead it's down 16% in the last 5 or so weeks. What gives? Especially in this environment with everybody staying home we should be using a lot more water, which should increase the revenue."
"at first not in favor of the peoples gas purchase, but it seems that the investing community does, and who is to say the wtr does not have its eyes on the water sewer authority in pittsburgh. gas mains and water mains run in the street."
At this price I think we are a very undervalued - I still think we should have stuck with water. Maybe the new CEO will come to that realization
More acquisitions coming this year. Stated Peoples has will close by years end.
Dividends coming June 1. Reinvest with 5% discount!!!. And increase in dividends next quarter makes me a very happy stockholder!
"I've invested in WTRG since it was PSC through the DRIP plan. I dont care for the gas portion of the bussiness, and after a few years under the new CEO, not sure I want to stay long with them. Any long time investors thoughts on this? I love AQUA, and in SE PA the customer base is still growing with each new ugly monstrous apartment building they construct. Nevertheless I feel like WTRG is stuck."
Anyone else notice the new map? Gas distribution in WV and KY where there are no water assets. WV and KY lie right in the middle of the existing water geography. Perhaps relationships with WV and KY regulators are synergistic to an expansion of water activities in those geographies?
"Dividend pay out this week, REINVEST with 5% discount!!!"
This thing is just sitting at this price -unlike the old days! I think it is somewhat of an opportunity
"Increase coming, from $.2507 to $.2682, great news"
"Are people forgetting that we will be entering a water crisis and that we need water and natural gas? I get it this is a safe haven stock. Pretty boring, but it’s water. Great long term buy"
"Maybe this acquisition is a sign of the times. I bought WTR to add 'water' to my portfolios in 2008; I also have gas, oil and power companies. I like to keep them separate, but this deal may work out. One problem with 'Peoples' is they have about 1300 miles of pipe needing replacement and WTR says they can do 150 miles per year. That's over 8 years! Hopefully no serious breakdowns will occur. Invest in steel and steel pipe companies hopefully made in the USA.Not much chance of a split now that the debt is increased."
"Just announced, 7% increase to $.219 per share!!! Great news indeed."
"Huge payday Monday, dividend day and reinvesting at 5% discount!!!"
My take on the Stock - In my humble opinionI think it is undervalued should be 65 or so and I think it is a good idea otherwise someone might want to buy it - reason it is so hard to get dividends these days and this one has been as steady bet. So I am buying more and the DRIP plan is a good way to go. Good luck to everyone. I hope I am correct for everyone.
"I have been investing in aqua America since 2003. Back then it was the Philadelphia suburban water company. I have an invested each month, starting with $25 a month worked my way up now $150. I use the drip. Take advantage of the 5% discount on reinvestments. I have invested $30,000 since 2003 and my the value of my stock is $110,000 now so for $30,000 I've gained $80,000. Just stick with it , slow and steady wins the race. It is a very well-run company and has been for the 17 years I've been in it."
"Please help me. I have WTR, Not WTRG. But it seems that they are the same company, but, the stock exist seperately. Big problem is that I can not do anything with WTR, I touch the list, the program does not respond at all. And, the stock price is stopped as of January 31st. What's wrong!?"
Mark you are complaining about getting the old CEO back while this stock performs better than it has ever revenue wise? 2007 revenue of $602M and has grown every single year since up to $890 in 2019.
What was the purpose of buying peoples gas?
still think this is undervalued
"I'm seeing a lot of people saying ""should have stuck with water"". My understanding is they are still focused on water? Just expanded their horizons into natural gas. What am I missing here?"
"@Mark You wrote a couple of months ago that WTRG seems like a good holding in part because dividends are hard to find. But WTRG’s dividend (2.28%) is way behind some other relatively safe companies, like Verizon (4.74%), IBM (4.8%), and AT&T (7.6%). Those companies have far better PEs, too. Some low-fee index funds have a far more impressive record. I have long held WTR in a DRiP, but am thinking about cashing out. With brokerages now offering commission-free stock purchases, sales, and dividend reinvestments, a 5% discount might be too little to make a DRiP worth starting or keeping, since the brokerage account offers more flexibility, speed, and investor control over the eventual account-closing share price."
"Water has no business going down due to corona virus, I'm buying in slowly. The market is such a drama queen"
Can anyone actually confirm that wtr still does dividend reinvestment with a 5% discount? Thx!
This stock has been dropping like a rock lately. Any ideas why out there ?
"I just called IR and had to leave a message.We'll see how long it takes to get back to me.And if they have anything of substance to day.Others shareholders or folks with interest may want to do the same.Stock has been treading water(ironically) the past 2 months after a nice rise the prior 5 months. AWK has been similar though,"
"I started a monthly purchase plan and dividend reinvestment (5% discount) when it was PSC (Philadelphia Suburban) back in 2003. I keep investing and reinvesting. So far I have invested $28,000 (less than $2,000/year) and it is now worth $68,000. Investing the small amount every year was relatively painless. Slow and steady wins the race."
The People’s Gas of Pittsburgh is now owned by Aqua. Aqua will be changing the name to Essential Utility Inc. in the near future . Great day for us!!!
"Just announced a 7% increase of dividend. New dividend will be $.2507 per quarter, payable next month, with 5% discount for reinvested dividends! Gee, I love this company!!!"
Dow Jones reported yesterday the judge recommended that the Pa PUC approve the sale of Peoples gas to WTR.
