WTRU reached an all time low at 48.65
With the share price looking at a 7+% increase or stock split. History shows WTR has split in this range. Love this stock
Pardon my ignorance but what the heck happened today ?
At this price I think we are a very undervalued - I still think we should have stuck with water. Maybe the new CEO will come to that realization
still think this is undervalued
"All time high at close, maybe the Pittsburgh Gas deal will soon be completed."
Does anyone know of other DRIP plans that purchase at a discount. WTR has been great
WTR has tanked recently. Anyone have any insights ?
WTRG is down 7.07% to 37.21
WTR gives notice of dividend increases around this tie each year for the Sept dividend. Maybe $.015 increase again. Love this stock increase each year and splits every few years. I realize splits mean nothing to value but buying each month one can buy more shares Your thoughts on this!
What's up with WTR today? WTR rarely has this much of a swing in any direction.
"Maybe this acquisition is a sign of the times. I bought WTR to add 'water' to my portfolios in 2008; I also have gas, oil and power companies. I like to keep them separate, but this deal may work out. One problem with 'Peoples' is they have about 1300 miles of pipe needing replacement and WTR says they can do 150 miles per year. That's over 8 years! Hopefully no serious breakdowns will occur. Invest in steel and steel pipe companies hopefully made in the USA.Not much chance of a split now that the debt is increased."
WTR has been falling off a cliff recently. Anyone have any insights ?
WTR reached an all time high at 50.26
"I’m worried about this purchase of this gas company. Seems they went way to far to take out huge “loans” to merge this into a water utilities . The repayment of loan will have a major hit to our dividend , Maybe no increase or possible decrease this September to our dividend. IMO. What are your thoughts?"
One advantage of DRIP plan buying lower than market price and it helps keep you i the game. Congrats!
"I've invested in WTRG since it was PSC through the DRIP plan. I dont care for the gas portion of the bussiness, and after a few years under the new CEO, not sure I want to stay long with them. Any long time investors thoughts on this? I love AQUA, and in SE PA the customer base is still growing with each new ugly monstrous apartment building they construct. Nevertheless I feel like WTRG is stuck."
What will be their next acsquisition
WTRU is down 8.92% to 47.29
WTRG is down 7.56% to 32.28
WTRG is up 5.50% to 35.31
Probably the only good news that the stock is low is it may become a take over candidate - who knows - don't know why it is struggling so much
Has anyone received their dividend statement yet. Payment made on 8/30
What was the purpose of buying peoples gas?
"Water has no business going down due to corona virus, I'm buying in slowly. The market is such a drama queen"
May be worth a buy/write for additional shares. Much better than AWK and with the Peoples deal there certainly is a catalyst.Hard to believe they would need another secondary after the recent one and the 750 Million from Canada.At yesterday's close at 39.06 and write Jan 2020 40's for 2.00 and collect some dividend also. Like almost 15% in 8 months if they get called away. If not it lowers my cost bases roughly 5%.Now look at a chart WTR is at a 52 week high and it's been moving higher quickly the past week or so actually since the secondary which is rare.
What’s going on today?
Er is tomorrow morning? Thought it was today ah.
Why the big drop?
This stock has been dropping like a rock lately. Any ideas why out there ?
WTRG is down 5.09% to 45.15
"I have been investing in aqua America since 2003. Back then it was the Philadelphia suburban water company. I have an invested each month, starting with $25 a month worked my way up now $150. I use the drip. Take advantage of the 5% discount on reinvestments. I have invested $30,000 since 2003 and my the value of my stock is $110,000 now so for $30,000 I've gained $80,000. Just stick with it , slow and steady wins the race. It is a very well-run company and has been for the 17 years I've been in it."
"Glad WTR went down today, dividend tomorrow with 5% discount, more shares coming our way!!!!!"
Another all time high again!!!
stock seems stagnant haha seriously thoughbig returns not here
WTR reached an all time high at 49.53
Could go to 75.00 on acquisition - I know that seems like a stretch but look at scale now. Just my humble opinion do your own due diligence of course. Good luck to all.
WTR closed at alltime high!!!
Down 4.5%- anyone have insight? this just market kicking around?
"Has anyone heard news of People’s Gas closing, was to before end of Sept."
Closed at all time high and crossed $42 for first time. Possible close on Peoples Gas next week.
Does anyone know when Peoples gas will close?
WTR reached an all time high at 51.57
WTRG is up 7.94% to 41.58

WTRG is up 4.90% to 38.50
WTRG is down 5.00% to 39.51
WTRU is down 9.45% to 46.68
"It’s now official, we are a water and Gas company. People’s Gas and aqua areOne company at last."
WTR has made many acquisitions already this year and many more to close on in the first quarter of 2019. Another 7% dividend increase in September !!!
"I just called IR and had to leave a message.We'll see how long it takes to get back to me.And if they have anything of substance to day.Others shareholders or folks with interest may want to do the same.Stock has been treading water(ironically) the past 2 months after a nice rise the prior 5 months. AWK has been similar though,"
I made a video about Essential Utilities ($WTRG)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjFXqXX3CoGross Margin 98%!!!
WTRG is down 8.48% to 39.40
"10/2 Peoples still delayed - waiting on a Judge, then PUC. All regulations stuff(where is Trump - lets get this done!). Not financing, etc.Think closing will go quickly after the Judge makes the ruling.Peoples Employees have to be wanting this out of limbo as well as us shareholders.Remember original closing date was beginning of June?"
This may go to 75 - who knows. Good luck to all!
"Dividend pay out this week, REINVEST with 5% discount!!!"
Still zero news on People’s Gas!!
WTRU is down 9.51% to 41.66
"Mark 9/01 on your calendar, reinvest your dividend with 5% discount with higher dividend payment!!!"
WTR is up 4.91% to 36.53
something is going on pre-market 1.7m shares?
WTR looks very well positioned for the Infrastructure bill.
What's with all the TV Ads? I live in SE Penna. For the last couple of weeks the CEO if Essential has done tons of TV advertisements on multiple channels about Aqua and Peoples gas. Peoples doesn't service this area. It looks like he running for office. Must be costing (wasting) millions of dollars for a utility that already has the customer base to do this. Anybody know what is going on?
Will people have trouble paying their water bills? Just asking.
"#WTR has been showing support at 32.89 and resistance at 34.72. Technical indicators are looking bullish, according to stoxline."
"at first not in favor of the peoples gas purchase, but it seems that the investing community does, and who is to say the wtr does not have its eyes on the water sewer authority in pittsburgh. gas mains and water mains run in the street."
"AWK & WTR are both down roughly 12% off respective highs. After getting over my emotional reaction of #$%$... it seems the rise in bond and inflation fear is driving the sector down and not just an issue with WTR. Probably a good time to buy for long term investors, but short term is probably going to be rough and slow go."
We need another stock dividend - hope it happens soon.
"So I've seen several posts on here about how we are entering a water supply crisis, which i wholeheartedly agree with. However, is WTRG really the right company to make money off of that? In order for them to profit, they'd have to own water rights. As far as I know, they only own distribution and treatment systems. I suppose treatment systems will be in high demand as well but does anyone know if they hold water rights as well?Also, most countries are finally waking up to the fact that their infrastructure that was installed after WW2 is going to have to be replaced in the next decade. It might be worthwhile investing in some pipe manufacturers as well. As someone who works in the Civil Engineering field, I can tell you that small town USA is going to be experiencing a reckoning of infrastructure problems very soon."
Today's news about Canadian Pension Fund helping with the Peoples Gas buyout and then getting a board seat for 750 million is good news.Didn't see an update on the closing date.
I think my broker just sold all the shares of the company because of the merger. If so I’ll take the little profits I made and invest elsewhere
"Dividend coming 3/1, reinvesting with 5% discount, gotta love it. WTR looooog for the rest of my life, increase in divy in September of about 7%!!!"
Odd that this is selling off a bit on a big buyer.
Looks like something going on - good day today!
WTRU is down 5.13% to 58.21
why is water getting murdered
"I was about to buy, but I don't like the recent increase in shares."
Anybody got a clue as to what happened today?
"Just announced a 7% increase of dividend. New dividend will be $.2507 per quarter, payable next month, with 5% discount for reinvested dividends! Gee, I love this company!!!"
WTRG reached a 52 Week low at 34.41
WTRG is up 4.92% to 47.54
Closed at all time high today. Wondering where it will head after closing on Pittsburg Gas???
"Just received a letter from WTR(G) today, we have almost doubled the amount of customers and employees . We have a lot of work to be done in the coming years, doubling the amount of pipes to replace the worn out ones. Go WTRG!!!"
WTR down but all my other portfolio items up and SPX up big time. Bad behavior for WTR but perhaps a good sign of rotation away from defensive stocks like WTR?
"I own several utiaties , it have to say that WTR is my favorite utility due to each year getting a 5-7% increase in dividend AND getting a 5% discount with reinvest of those dividends. Will never take dividends unless necessary . We will devide all shares equally and leave to all our grandchildren !"
Closed at all time high H2O is the way to go!
Yesterday Aqua purchased another water/wast system making the one million customer threshold . More closing before end of the year!!!
"Huge payday Monday, dividend day and reinvesting at 5% discount!!!"
WTRU reached an all time high at 64.14
WTRG is up 7.76% to 39.43
"Dividend today, more stock on the way!!"
"I wonder when they will start reporting these new deals? The analysts on the conference call all wanted to know about the 415,000 new customers that could add."
More acquisitions coming this year. Stated Peoples has will close by years end.
"oldman Sachs Names 2 'Relatively Defensive' Water Utility Plays11:00am ET 4/16/2020 BenzingaMentioned in articleAWKWTRGWater utility stocks are trading at a premium valuation to electric and gas utilities, which seems justified given their longer depreciable life and visibility into above-average growth due to significant water pipe investment needs, according to Goldman Sachs.The American Water Works, Essential Utilities AnalystInsoo Kim said in a Wednesday note that water utilities have abundant growth opportunities in a fragmented market and their premium valuation appears sustainable, with continued environmental, social and governance momentum.American Water Works: Best-In-Class GrowthKim upgraded American Water Works Company Inc (NYSE: AWK) from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $134 to $146.The company hasÂ been generating best-in-class earnings growth of 8.3% and should continue to deliver above-average growth in the long term due to organic investments and municipal system acquisitions, the analyst said.Â American Water Works is the only large-cap, pure-play water utility and has an ESG-friendly status, he said.Tthe company has a stable balance sheet, which should continue to improve through 2022, according to Goldman Sachs.Â Essential Utilities: A Water-Gas MixThe Goldman Sachs analyst initiated coverage of Essential Utilities Inc (NYSE: WTRG) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target.Â The company, which was formed by the merger of Aqua America and Peoples Gas, is likely to generateÂ robust 6.6% earnings growth annually from 2019 to 2022, Kim said.TheÂ stock valuation already reflects these positives, the analyst said.Â Both American Water Works and Essential Utilities 'remain relatively defensive in the current COVID-19 environment,' he said.Â AWK, WTRG Price ActionAmerican Water Works shares were trading 1.99% higher at $131.78 at the time of publication Thursday, while Essential Utilities shares were up 1.67% at $42.70.Â Related Links:A Peek Into The Markets: US Stock Futures Gain Ahead Of Morgan Stanley EarningsStocks That Hit 52-Week Lows On MondayLatest Ratings for AWK DateFirmActionFromToApr 2020Goldman SachsUpgradesNeutralBuy Mar 2020UBSMaintainsNeutral Feb 2020BairdMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for AWK View the Latest Analyst Ratings 2020 Benzinga.com.

Higher dividend coming next week!!!
Couldn't see pricing of the secondary in the articles last night.
People need water at least 20 seconds every time they wash their hands. Seems like a good investment.
"Is CWCO being bought out by WTR?CWCO has hired an ""evaluation firm"".Is CWCO spinning off assets to WTR or another water company?Who other than WTR would be interest in buying CWCO?"
Please get the old CEO back to help. (or at least be on an advisory council)
I'm starting to worry about this. https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hacker-tried-poison-calif-water-supply-was-easy-entering-password-rcna1206
"I'm not happy about the recent fall, but that decline seems to be about dividend stocks in general, having nothing to do with WTR's fundamentals. I'm no genius, but my plan is to hold, watch to see when the bottom, seems to be reached, and then to consider adding to my position. If inflation increases too much, I will have to rethink that strategy. Your thinking, amigos?"
Down about 8% in five days Hmmmm!!!
WTRG is down 7.04% to 37.21
I thought the 7% dividend increase would have pushed us a little higher today.
"Very bad week for WTRG. Looking at the positive side.”, more stock on Monday with our dividends!"
Has WTRG closed on People’s Gas yet? Can not get any information on yahoo updates since symbol change.
"Are people forgetting that we will be entering a water crisis and that we need water and natural gas? I get it this is a safe haven stock. Pretty boring, but it’s water. Great long term buy"
the USA the gop represents in congress must have no women and no minorities. Nothing but old rich men USA..judgingby the gop in congress which has abut zero minorities (5%) and about zero women (again 5%)compare to the dems in congress whose number reflect the actual population FAR BETTER than the gop... dem minorities = 38% compared to 5% for gop (women 33% dem......5% gop)
WTRU is down 5.91% to 54.56
"Why did we go down almost 5 1/2 % today? 3/31/20. End of the month thing? The S&P was only down 1.6%.I was depending on this stock to maintain it's price in a market down turn . Instead it's down 16% in the last 5 or so weeks. What gives? Especially in this environment with everybody staying home we should be using a lot more water, which should increase the revenue."
What happened today to cause almost a 3 1/2% drop ? Anyone ?
WTR expanding into more wastewater announcing a few more MA purchases
I hope they get bought out - people used to think $30/share was alot.
I don’t get it
Can anyone actually confirm that wtr still does dividend reinvestment with a 5% discount? Thx!
WTR was beaten down after gas company but out. Now starting to go back up!
another all time high
what is up this!!
Great day ! But why ?
WTRG is down 16.68% to 32.02
After waiting 6 mos I'm out at a $1 profit. I Gotta let the dust settle on this. Simply not enough info I can find to make me stay in - even on their website. What is the effective share price of all these shares they're selling? The Dilution? Maybe I'm missing something but for now - I'm gone.
"WTR just closed on two more acquisitions today in Pa making seven for the year and the huge one next month with Pittsburgh Gas,"
"Another all time high today, go long!"
I wish they would bring the old CEO back at least as a consultant; this stock used to be a great ride
Anyone know what why WTR down hard today?
WTRU reached an all time high at 69.40
WTR is down 6.92% to $35.26
WTRU is up 6.02% to 47.01
I miss the old CEO - felt better about all of this
I never received my dividend news from WTR. Did anyone get theirs?
Will WTR be. $50+ stock after the huge acquisition they just bought and People’s Gas??
All time high on Friday!
WTRG reached a 52 Week low at 32.02
Any chance this company could be acquired? Thoughts? No idea here.seems like water will be extremely important down the road or do you think they might buy another water company which I think could be interesting.
WTR reached an all time high at 41.40

Anyone else notice the new map? Gas distribution in WV and KY where there are no water assets. WV and KY lie right in the middle of the existing water geography. Perhaps relationships with WV and KY regulators are synergistic to an expansion of water activities in those geographies?
Does anyone know how the gas transition is doing?
test
WTRU is down 5.02% to 58.45
"Dividend coming at the end of the month, reinvesting with 5% discount!!! Doesn’t get better then this"
"Tomorrow’s dividend day and market is again in the red to start the day, hoping for a neutral day or a little decline to buy more stock at a 5% discount!!!"
"All time high, closing over $40!"
My take on the Stock - In my humble opinionI think it is undervalued should be 65 or so and I think it is a good idea otherwise someone might want to buy it - reason it is so hard to get dividends these days and this one has been as steady bet. So I am buying more and the DRIP plan is a good way to go. Good luck to everyone. I hope I am correct for everyone.
"Can anybody explain why utilities are getting socked worse than the rest of the market ? Usually, they take a lesser hit than other stocks."
WTRU reached an all time low at 43.99
Nice rebound today!
Next month the dividend will be increased about 7-7.5% which is the average in past ten years
WTRU is up 8.01% to 57.82
"This was on my radar but it needs to do something. Looking less appealing. Other stocks more dividend, trending up..."
Great to see the market cap go above 10 billion with the stock price following nicely.
WTR reached an all time high at 40.49

WTRG is down 6.18% to 47.20
"@Mark You wrote a couple of months ago that WTRG seems like a good holding in part because dividends are hard to find. But WTRG’s dividend (2.28%) is way behind some other relatively safe companies, like Verizon (4.74%), IBM (4.8%), and AT&T (7.6%). Those companies have far better PEs, too. Some low-fee index funds have a far more impressive record. I have long held WTR in a DRiP, but am thinking about cashing out. With brokerages now offering commission-free stock purchases, sales, and dividend reinvestments, a 5% discount might be too little to make a DRiP worth starting or keeping, since the brokerage account offers more flexibility, speed, and investor control over the eventual account-closing share price."
50.00/share a milestone that may be coming up or a split/ bottom line either share goes up or increasing dividend good for shareholders. Good luck to all.
People’s Gas acquisition delayed to end of Dec/earlyJan!
In today!
"Stock market taking a pounding . Own 20 different companies, only two up, both waterCo. WTR and AWK !!!"
I wonder if this gas acquisition was a good idea - water is where it is at
"Ditto, another all time close today!!! Congrats to all longs!"
WTRG is down 8.21% to 38.78
"Just announced, 7% increase to $.219 per share!!! Great news indeed."
WTRG is up 7.20% to 35.00
Dividends coming June 1. Reinvest with 5% discount!!!. And increase in dividends next quarter makes me a very happy stockholder!
In the old days they would have split this stock in my opinion. Wonder what next step since dividend is a low percentage now
This thing is just sitting at this price -unlike the old days! I think it is somewhat of an opportunity
"WTR just announced the largest acquisition in the history of the company teaching 500,000 customers!!! Great news and the closing of People’s Gas will add to our assets!"

Looks more like Jan to complete Pittsburgh Gas
I'd expect with cold weather really kicking in extra gas revenue should follow soon and be noticeable in the 1st qtr.
WTRU is up 9.68% to 56.08
"I'm seeing a lot of people saying ""should have stuck with water"". My understanding is they are still focused on water? Just expanded their horizons into natural gas. What am I missing here?"
When will they announce the increase and/or split this month???
this is a steady climber- usually splits the stock when it gets 35 + ; but this time action is very positive. only variable is rate increases?
WTRG is up 8.57% to 41.80
"CEO Franklin is a PR guy and not an engineer that has run this company for decades. The PR guy wants you to see good things and spin good things, the engineer makes things good that are good. This is a bad CEO."
Keep on bull
WTRU is down 10.75% to 47.75
"I started a monthly purchase plan and dividend reinvestment (5% discount) when it was PSC (Philadelphia Suburban) back in 2003. I keep investing and reinvesting. So far I have invested $28,000 (less than $2,000/year) and it is now worth $68,000. Investing the small amount every year was relatively painless. Slow and steady wins the race."
Is Aqua trading under WTR or WTRG why two symbols
"Over the past 1yr, 2yr, 5yr WTR is basically the same as the SPY and AWK has had double the returns.As I continue to lighten up on AWK(gets to over 20% in my portfolio) I started to diversify into WTR. With the first buyout of a gas utility(Peoples) by a water Company and the recent secondary is certainly a wildcard.And earnings tomorrow! And I would expect an update on the Peoples buyout.A buy/write today is as much a gamble as an investment but if I get a decent price I will.Also within spitting distance of the high a few years ago."
The market is spooked on dividend paying stocks values because of the potential raise in interest rates. Utilities and bonds have been on the skids.
Why it’s down??
"Increase coming, from $.2507 to $.2682, great news"
Why did the stock rise on very heavy volume yesterday?
You folks asking why should do some of your own DD or atleast read recent posts here!How in the world do you make investment decisions?
WTRG is down 6.64% to 43.26
That was a nice trade. In at $31 and out at $40. I will buy again I again 35.
Not in love with this deal. I liked owning a water company. Now I own an energy company tied to wild swings in nat gas prices with a lot of debt.
"Don't forget, symbol is now WTRG as of today. Trading at $53.24 when I pulled it up."
Dow Jones reported yesterday the judge recommended that the Pa PUC approve the sale of Peoples gas to WTR.
The People’s Gas of Pittsburgh is now owned by Aqua. Aqua will be changing the name to Essential Utility Inc. in the near future . Great day for us!!!
Any reason to hold onto this loser ?
taken a beaten
Closed at another all time high. Could be at $50 by end of week.. This is without any news of closing of Pittsburgh Gas!
"Please help me. I have WTR, Not WTRG. But it seems that they are the same company, but, the stock exist seperately. Big problem is that I can not do anything with WTR, I touch the list, the program does not respond at all. And, the stock price is stopped as of January 31st. What's wrong!?"
Does anyone know if WTR has closed on any of the pending acquisitions??
Down 10 % in a few days. Hoping for a rebound.
could be announcing a 5 for 4 split
"About three weeks ago WTR went over one million customers, but with today’s announcement , WTR will go over two million customers. Go WTR!!!"
Next stop $62+
I'm thinking as long as Aqua didn't over pay the peoples acquisition should be a good thing.
wow what a great buy this was under $31 this morning.
Can anyone confer the dividend date ??
Hopefully raise dividend after acqusition or do stock split
WTRG is down 7.06% to 36.73
WTR just announced a 7% dividend increase to $.2353 per quarter . Good news indeed.
"Here is a thought. If you are overweight water stocks sell a little when you can. That is what I had done early on with this dip for this reason.I thought they were the best possible stocks to own. Safe, dividend, etc. But here is the reason. Folks are hiding in utilities a bit, they usually do when times get tough. But folks sell stocks like AWK, WTR(WTRG), JNJ, PEP, etc to buy high BETA stocks in anticipation of things getting better. When they no longer care about safe stocks."
Should focus on water!
WTRU is up 10.80% to 52.74
Sold my entire lot. Not interested in owning a fossil fuel company.
WTRG new ticker symbol.
As Jim Cramer would say: BUY BUY BUY BUY
WTRG is down 7.61% to 43.12
WTRG is down 4.91% to 42.23
Mark you are complaining about getting the old CEO back while this stock performs better than it has ever revenue wise? 2007 revenue of $602M and has grown every single year since up to $890 in 2019.
new tax law doesn't favor utilities
"For all NYS stockholders, FYI : all bars and food establishments will close for ??? TillFurther notice at 20:00 hrs!"
"Another new high for WTR and AWK, water utilities up through the roof today!!!"
Congrats to all the longs like myself
Has WTR closed on Pitt Gas yet. Last I heard was sometime in June
