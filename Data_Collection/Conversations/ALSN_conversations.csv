https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nikolas-stock-jumps-after-report-of-2500-electric-garbage-truck-order-2020-08-10?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooDoes ALSN have a transmission for electric trucks? As far as I know they only make an electric-hybrid transmission. Could be the beginning of the end for ALSN?

"long shot, but does anybody know if Allison is involved with the building transmissions in electric cars or even the Electric diesel?"
not much interest here. notice similar on mtor. just not much interest in transmissions axel etc. not sexy i guess? still seems to have good prospects. i wonder about such an old name having a lot of legacy obligations to past employees etc could be a hidden drag on earnings. curiosa about less drop in stock price during last spring than dow or 500.
