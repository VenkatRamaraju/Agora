should see about 45 to 46 if the up trend keeps going. you will see small pull backs when they is people taking some profits but should continue to the up side. may take 10 to 14 days to hit 46 mark
"Nice EPS, revenues need some boosting. Surely will start moving up, it has been inverse of market this year."
"Hedge Funds Are Buying Allison Transmission Holdings Inc (ALSN)Insider Monkey Asma UL Husna,Insider Monkey•September 14, 2020"
It'd be nice if this thing could do something. That earnings report tomorrow better be good.
4M share block today at $37.50
Allison Transmission is up 4.94% to 34.18
from a zacks comment on auto sales in Europe. Allison Transmission ALSN inked a $27 million worth deal to acquire the transmission portfolio of India-based AVTEC Ltd.’s off-highway business and Madras Export Processing Zone off-highway component machining business.
Too many people interested in turning daily profits and not long term. I’m doubting it gains $3 this year
"The action on this stock never reflects its potential or developments. If the right funds come along and really get an idea of where Allison is going, then perhaps it will go where all of its sales, innovation, and leadership are pointing it."
EARNING I THINK will be good maybe GREAT. I'm betting on it from last CC.
the reaction will be good after the fed meeting and should see 3 + dollars increase in stock price over the next 3 or 4 trading days
"Seems like a good company, I invested at $39.00, looks good for a opening stock."
Has Allison shifted to overdrive? or is a buy out lurking in the wings?
"Yippeee, let's go to 28. I'm ready to pile in..."

"Keep bringing it down. If it hits 28, I will sell my dog and baseball card collection and buy every share I can….lol"
Allison Transmission reached a 52 Week low at 33.10
not much interest here. notice similar on mtor. just not much interest in transmissions axel etc. not sexy i guess? still seems to have good prospects. i wonder about such an old name having a lot of legacy obligations to past employees etc could be a hidden drag on earnings. curiosa about less drop in stock price during last spring than dow or 500.
"This thing cannot hold anything, so undervalued, haha. Look at EPS vs price, smh."
Why is this down AH? Looked like a strong beat.
