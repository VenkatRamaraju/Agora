"WELL GUYS, 10$+ EASY MONDAY"
my 5009 shares times .01 hmmmmm better div stock outhere
.10 Dividend. They are holding back money again. The stock price is about right $5 to $5.50 If your looking at dividend only SLVO pays monthly .19 Cents on $6.40 stock. Ex-date is next Tuesday or 4-20.
"hi guys, im new to this and just getting started with dividends. been struggling like a dummy to find how often does Tremont pay their dividends. or is this monthly?"
payout going be beautiful picture on 15 few days away . 5000 shares holding
pre market 6.20
"After thinking about this a bit, we were all hoping for a larger dividend increase just a week or so ago to propel this stock above $7/share. We were all disappointed with the $0.10/share divvy announcement. Now we have the merger announcement which would seem to cap the stock price to about $6.50. What are your thoughts on this?"
"Next div could very well be .01, would not want to be holding if that's the case, would be interested in getting back in at some point. RMR stocks + no divs leads major to underperformance unfortunately"
going wait a year bigger divends
can someone fill me in on the drop
boring
Thinking about one time dividend........in 2019 dividend was $0.22/quarter or $0.88/year. This year it has been $0.04/year with earnings slated to be $1.14/share. 90% of $1.14 is $1.03 minus $0.04 = $0.99. Be conservative and take 90% of that which would be $0.90/share. Is this thinking way out of whack?
Next DDD January 24 for 22 cents? Thanks
.01 cheaper than toilet paper
sell the turd. .01 divends what a joke . I got some pay .60
bank stocks rising
Announcement on merger with RMRM. Hopefully will be a big plus. Short term bump to 6.50/share. I'd like to see the dividend about triple from here and then the price will go even higher.
what we getting divend .03 hahahaha
Divi announcement should be coming soon. If $0.15/Q or $0.60/yr then I say $7/share at least. If $0.20/Q or $0.80/yr then I say $8+.
yummy divendeds
Earnings should be first of February. On January 15 The Street put out a report to hold.
"So, a YE div of $0.53/share. Thoughts?"
grate stock to own excellent dividends and very low price now.I keep buying when it drops. BUY BUY BUY..
If they pay out .53 and then .22 next dividend you are getting back 16% of the share price in just 3 months.Where else can you get that?
"A company this small can't continue to pay their stated dividends if they don't have the earnings to support it. Look for a divvy cut for this quarter as they have currently no more cash to invest, as they stated they are fully invested."
SHORT SQUEEZE THE SHORTS
Where do you think this will trade Monday morning?

"They put out a low div (.10) to keep the price low, they knew they were merging and did not want the price up or they would need to give more shares to the investors. Great move if you’re a Board member, not so good if you’re a stockholder like most of us."
why fees earn a paycheck if revenues hit the target get a bonus ortherwise no fees
Prediction of new divvy?
BUMS
"Any reason that this stock is not moving UP ?..... it seems to have all the elements of a Super Stock Positive and improving EPR, Low PE ratio, Small Cap Low Float, Insiders and Institution buying, Increasing revenue with well controlled Expenses....."
Will this stock ever GO UP
"TRVG (Trivago SP $5) share free float 51M only About a quarter of the Americans and nearly a third of Brits said their goal for their first post-pandemic trip would be to spend time with family and friends they weren't able to see because of COVID-19 restrictions.

"Volume is up, price is up. 15 days till earnings, usually that means people leaking information"

zzzzzzzzzzzz hope goes to 5 need nice dividend not .01
bought a stock pays .70 a share divends and only nine dallor stock see my point
POS
If I bought shares on the 15th did I miss the dividends payout ?
And now I see where this merger is being viewed as a problem.
Stock not going anywhere best sell at opening cause you don’t know merger will pay dividends or not
Watch share price after x-dividend day.
This one is undervalued.
"Movement today was impressive, good report coming?"
Don’t take less than current book value. Join the lawsuit. The recovery is here and now. Why would you get $0.60 on the dollar for shares.
my opion pep pays a divend and ko and they make new highs every year
come on guys buy stock .01 divends yuck
div play yuck better stocks pay more same price
