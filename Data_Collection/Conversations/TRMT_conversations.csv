SHORT SQUEEZE THE SHORTS
sell the turd. .01 divends what a joke . I got some pay .60
Go baby go!
"Next div could very well be .01, would not want to be holding if that's the case, would be interested in getting back in at some point. RMR stocks + no divs leads major to underperformance unfortunately"
There sb a class action lawsuit. How can they come out with a secondary offering at 25% of the IPO in less than 2 years???
"hi guys, im new to this and just getting started with dividends. been struggling like a dummy to find how often does Tremont pay their dividends. or is this monthly?"
BUMS

"Volume is up, price is up. 15 days till earnings, usually that means people leaking information"

hmmmm nice revenues . end year pay out hmmmmmm what's that .02 hahahaha
Where do you think this will trade Monday morning?
Thinking about one time dividend........in 2019 dividend was $0.22/quarter or $0.88/year. This year it has been $0.04/year with earnings slated to be $1.14/share. 90% of $1.14 is $1.03 minus $0.04 = $0.99. Be conservative and take 90% of that which would be $0.90/share. Is this thinking way out of whack?
"They put out a low div (.10) to keep the price low, they knew they were merging and did not want the price up or they would need to give more shares to the investors. Great move if you’re a Board member, not so good if you’re a stockholder like most of us."
record volume Friday . open at 6
wow nice quarter everything looks great. this puppy going up
payout going be beautiful picture on 15 few days away . 5000 shares holding
"16% Dividend , up .25 in last two weeks!"
I’m out worst merger I seen .
my opion pep pays a divend and ko and they make new highs every year
This one is undervalued.
bank stocks rising
yummy divendeds
If they pay out .53 and then .22 next dividend you are getting back 16% of the share price in just 3 months.Where else can you get that?
my 5009 shares times .01 hmmmmm better div stock outhere
Prediction of new divvy?
.01 cheaper than toilet paper
Earnings should be first of February. On January 15 The Street put out a report to hold.
yah so love the divend. .53 on 5000 charges can't complain that roughy 2500 cash on 20000 investment. where you get that cash. my damn saving gives me .50 cents on same amount
"A company this small can't continue to pay their stated dividends if they don't have the earnings to support it. Look for a divvy cut for this quarter as they have currently no more cash to invest, as they stated they are fully invested."
"WELL GUYS, 10$+ EASY MONDAY"
And now I see where this merger is being viewed as a problem.
Announcement on merger with RMRM. Hopefully will be a big plus. Short term bump to 6.50/share. I'd like to see the dividend about triple from here and then the price will go even higher.
If I bought shares on the 15th did I miss the dividends payout ?
what we getting divend .03 hahahaha
why fees earn a paycheck if revenues hit the target get a bonus ortherwise no fees
TRMT 8.3 million shares. With a pay out of 4.4 million dollars on or about Jan. 15. Let's see if share price get a good bump up on the DRIP.
anybody got divened. thought payout yesderday
smell ten
after hours 6 1
"After thinking about this a bit, we were all hoping for a larger dividend increase just a week or so ago to propel this stock above $7/share. We were all disappointed with the $0.10/share divvy announcement. Now we have the merger announcement which would seem to cap the stock price to about $6.50. What are your thoughts on this?"
pay .90 divend on 4.75 wow
grate stock to own excellent dividends and very low price now.I keep buying when it drops. BUY BUY BUY..
Don’t take less than current book value. Join the lawsuit. The recovery is here and now. Why would you get $0.60 on the dollar for shares.
You dont declare a 18% dividend if your quarter isnt going to be outstanding! see you Aug 6th. GLTAL
going wait a year bigger divends
Is this a long-play options for us?
Next DDD January 24 for 22 cents? Thanks
$TRMT watching bank stocks reports. $WMC$IVR$TWO$NYMT
can someone fill me in on the drop
"Movement today was impressive, good report coming?"
POS
Kaboom! In after hours trading.
Watch share price after x-dividend day.
time sell
Stock not going anywhere best sell at opening cause you don’t know merger will pay dividends or not
"TRVG (Trivago SP $5) share free float 51M only About a quarter of the Americans and nearly a third of Brits said their goal for their first post-pandemic trip would be to spend time with family and friends they weren't able to see because of COVID-19 restrictions. For senior citizens, the numbers were even higher: 35% of Americans and 47% of Brits. $TRMT $XNET $CXDO $BOXL $OPHC"
"So, a YE div of $0.53/share. Thoughts?"
Is this a good long term hold
.10 Dividend. They are holding back money again. The stock price is about right $5 to $5.50 If your looking at dividend only SLVO pays monthly .19 Cents on $6.40 stock. Ex-date is next Tuesday or 4-20.
Divi announcement should be coming soon. If $0.15/Q or $0.60/yr then I say $7/share at least. If $0.20/Q or $0.80/yr then I say $8+.
div cut to 1cent per share
