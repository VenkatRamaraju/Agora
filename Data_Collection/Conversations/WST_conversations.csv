"Our pivot point is at 445. Our preference: as long as 445 is support look for 491. Alternative scenario: the downside breakout of 445 would call for 430 and 422. Comment: the RSI is above 70. It could mean either that the stock is in a lasting uptrend or just overbought and therefore bound to correct (look for bearish divergence in this case). The MACD is below its signal line and positive. The stock could retrace in the short term. Moreover, the stock is trading above both its 20 and 50 day moving average (respectively at 443.671 and 406.7686)."

"West uses temp hires for some production for some of their products. Approximately 20 of us were laid off on Thursday, 2/1/18. Then the spokesmouth offered to place us at another facility that was 24 miles from my residence, and for the Arizona minimum wage of $10.50 per hour. No offer to hire us on as real employees with benefits. But he tried to make it sound like a win/win. Good Luck with that spin.Why would anyone travel father daily for a minimum wage job? And now those products are being produced by minimum wage workers right here in the USA. Something is very wrong with the division I worked in, and possibly company wide."
