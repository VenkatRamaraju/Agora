Great recovery.. shows strength and believe
ETSY isn’t AMZN the CEO told the truth and guided down for this QTR and the Depop purchase was brilliant! I’m LONG and not giving up my shares to the shorts…..mark this comment for Wednesday
"ETSY will bounce back, this is a great company. It's so typical these days to have a solid company's stock goes down right after great earnings, will take a few months will be back in $200+"
does anyone think it will drop below 205?
up 6% today so realistically we only went down 6% from yesterday
In a few months or no time people we definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy bitcoin or invest in any cryptocurrency
Easy money with etsy
bought at 8 and might sell at 800 (probably not) when ETSY is the boutique store for the entire Western World...and who knows where else...their Reverb and Fashion acquisitions will likely add to the empire. Consider that rev comps beat at about 25% after 100% plus growth last quarters. Thus they excelled well beyond that initial massive Covid boost. Speaks volumes. Long term pass on to your generations stock. Adios Pelota
$ZM $PTON earning get dump again just like every other work from home stocks. $FVRR $UPWK $PINS $ETSY
I thought of selling the stock before the earnings rpt. But I didn't
"Well, Jim Cramer just had good things to say about ETSY..."
Been in forever but added on the last pullback. Why is up today so much ? maybe it time for covered calls
$100 (13B Cap) very fair price target here 2B revenue with 400M Net it’s nothing
"Hedges messing with AMC, AMD and now Etsy? No? Etsy is Hedges’ top 7 invested stock in the world.They are trying to FUD us to sell so they can buy for cheap prices."
$pins $upwk $fvrr $etsy The Great Reset
"ouch this one hurts , 8"
"Slowing sales, lower guidance, PE over 60. I am out."
"Sold out of Etsy today, will be back when it comes down under 200"
"ETSY: 25B Cap, 450M Net revenue TBLA: 2B Cap, 1.2B revenue"
$WISH I didn't get in $PINS at $12I didn't get in $ETSY at $6 I didn't get in $SHOP at $20I didn't get in $AMZN at $37 so yeah I like $WISH under 10$ and I’m adding every pay biatches 
"what is the reason for etsy up today? acquisition of some sort""? NO earnings report i know that."
Compare ETSY with MELI not with AMZNETSY is a $ 300 stock $ 250 Thurdsday
"good thing is, the price is going up. Sad thing is, i find myself difficult to average down"
"Etsy should partner with Affirm financing, would be huge for both companies"
"Really wild fluctuations recently. I'm long and plan on holding for while, but this ahead of earnings is kind of strange. Drops on PIN's earnings last week after running back up to 210, now back up 7% before ER, when management already said the growth pace will be hard to keep up with Covid comps from last year. Love it long term but suspicious. Oh well, back where it was in late July."
"Investing in cryptocurrency now is really cool, especially with current rise in the market for now."
"Morgan Stanley has been negative Etsy for a while. They downgraded to underweight on 12/5/19 (and had previously been underweight a year or 2 before before equal weighting it) with a price target of $52 when Etsy was trading at $41.Thereafter maintained underweight with following targets:3/30/20 target $30 Etsy at $38.5/7/20 $43 target and Etsy at $767/16/20 $65 and $84.8/6/20 $68 and $130.10/29/20 $74 and $1321/15/21 $93 and $2042/26/21 $123 and $220.5/6/21 $135 and $1578/5/21 upgrade to equal weight, price target $163. ETSY bounces off morning lows and now at $187.Being underweight above $200 may have made some sense temporarily, and kudos for sticking to your guns in the face of a massive rally, but they chased the price with the price target all along. The ""advice"" was wrong."
"Why can $HOOD be up 80 percent and worth a trillion dollars, but a profitable company tanks. This market doesn’t care about growing profits. Same as PINS"
Why everytime a stock tanks everyone say oh its the hedgies oh its the shorts. It's ppl selling that's it. Earnings came out although they were pretty good it still showed slowed growth and sellers sold nothing wrong with that. Longs would be smart to get puts here or have sold secure puts earlier today. Still a great company and will show continous growth for longs.
"Continue to buy every dip. If covid-19 gets worse (a more virulent strain equally transmissible) and if there are additional shutdowns, then this stock will outperform. Covid is a fall winter virus, so we can expect this one to outperform in the upcoming months."
Lets take this bad boy to $250 by EOW.
I mean we knew this would happen based off earnings from Amazon right 
I am a buyer tomorrow between 170-180. I am gonna have to retire early if market keeps throwing me this kind of deals.
or <200 tomorrow
"Contrarian. Up big yesterday on a down day, down today on a huge up day. But up on the week, 3rd week in a row. More back and fill and consolidation."
Etsy will continue to have great earnings and excellent management. I truly see this company flourishing in the next decade
"Seems the trend (with any stock) is to sell prior to earnings, then scoop 'em up a day later at a steep discount regardless of how awesome earnings are."
what happened here???
Good luck timing the market to all who sold
