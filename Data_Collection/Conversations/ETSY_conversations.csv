$ETSY all in. this easy money. scare and buy cheap shares. I'll take them.
"Guess it is trying for $180. Target is in sight, coming into range, ...."
"this is my impression:A lot of Reits are red, while Etsy’s green,Makes me think, what if people are betting on the fact that more businesses are going to close (hurting the commercial real estate market), and instead these businesses will move all of their efforts online, ETSY being one of the main hubs for niche products, or vibe for those small local shop kind of vibe, which would exactly be the first type of shops to have to close down, cause they typically don’t have the strongest financials or investors backing.If these are linked, then I could see how this stock has a lot of potential.What are your thoughts? I’m wondering if there’s still a lot of headroom left?"
Etsy is down 6.48% to 192.69
For anyone that $WISHed that they invested in $ETSY when it was below $20. Your $WISH came through
I think lot of people shorted this stock based on media saying bad earning
Wonder what this week’s excuse will be for staying below $200?
Bought in at open. Safest stock in my portfolio
Easy money with etsy
below 120$ stock
Beat on both revenue & EPS. Silly selling rn. This will bounce back.
"Regarding the $1b senior notes, good news!!!!!!!!!!!!Relax! They are notes, not stocks.Note holders won’t convert them into shares unless the company is doing fine 10 years from today. But then the stock price will be already $1,000.So this issuance shouldn’t affect the stock at all, except that the company has an extra $1 b of cash to use to improve itself."
Bloodbath of a day and Etsy doesn’t blink!!! Tremendously bullish!!!
It is obvious etsy gets hit for ot sky high increase year on year but should allow God pandemic and considering that the results are very good. Compared to 2019 190 percent increase and no allowance for masks 30 percent increase so next yeat should make for improved comparisons especially when revenue from new companies kick in. Good time to time codt or add to positions for multinsg returns but ca not expect like lady year once on life opportunoty to catch 2 to 3 years growth in 6 to 9 months
Blame today’s red on the DOW and Nasdaq. They were both up nicely. What’s ETSY’s excuse today for not seeing $200?
125.00 stock
A lot of nonsense here now that some of the air is out of ETSY. As an investor I see this as a potential buy but can wait a bit to see where it goes to next. Their business hasn't changed and they do make money. Their expansion around the world is great strategy. How it closes today will be very informative. Chill on the opening which should be pretty ugly.
Why everytime a stock tanks everyone say oh its the hedgies oh its the shorts. It's ppl selling that's it. Earnings came out although they were pretty good it still showed slowed growth and sellers sold nothing wrong with that. Longs would be smart to get puts here or have sold secure puts earlier today. Still a great company and will show continous growth for longs.
"Eleven straight green sessions greeted rudely in red by July. Never goes up all the time, but a $0.50 loss would have been enough for me."
made my money with etsy thank you! Another stock that has a big potentiel is $WISH very undervalued and revenues projected is way more than etsy and the stock still at 11$
Etsy is going back to where it belongs
"Lol, this is why I hate corrupt hedges. They are trying to crush the share prices down so that retail investors sell them in cheap prices and hfs #$%$ them.Hold and keep buying."
"Take notice of e-commerce's larger growth trend, instead of focusing on daily coronavirus news. E-commerce sales accounted for just 11% of U.S. retail sales last year and now make up 16% of sales. Even before the pandemic, e-commerce sales were growing quickly as more retailers realized that they needed to reach consumers online, as well as in person. All of which means that, even with a coronavirus vaccine, it's very unlikely that consumers will suddenly drop the convenience of online shopping."
Why is this up today???
See ya at $220/Share!
Been in forever but added on the last pullback. Why is up today so much ? maybe it time for covered calls
It will go down 170 after market open and then recover completely
-$70 after hours
Holding 300 Shares..This will be a 10Bagger LT
"Stocks down big today are $lmnd, $etsy, $uber, $fsly, $gm, $roku, $lyft, $sklz. I own none of these. Feel better lcid is not down that much. Lcid will bleed slowly."
"Etsy is still in the early innings. I live in Japan and often use Etsy. But whenever I say “Etsy” to large groups of Japanese, they don’t know about it. Eventually they will. Etsy, in my opinion, has a unique moat with a long runway for growth."
Brazil aquisition = back to $220? at least lol
I  ETSY It just expanded and bought Depop in GB and Elo in Mexico. More to come…
You know the stock is going to tank when you see this.
Etsy is up 6.61% to 215.65
etsy sux
Finishing its cup and handle. Look for a big run up!!! 
$ZM $PTON earning get dump again just like every other work from home stocks. $FVRR $UPWK $PINS $ETSY
“New User Growth Decelerates Abruptly”
Grip it and rip itGame changerBeen saying since 8 a share
Its times like these that you realize most people are just day traders and out to make a quick buck. Its been proven time and time again that buy and hold investors make more than people who go in and out of the market
$200 today?
"I’m long too but if you’re buying this stock just because of the “delta variant”, that’s ridiculous. You’ll be selling a week later when the media decides to tell you everything’s okay again."
Melt up Monday?
Confirming cup and handle.
Etsy's time will come
"International revenue is 42% of etsy revenue. More lock downs in Europe. Etsy small sellers don't encounter same supply chain issues.... This will only speed up consumers adapting to etsy. Analyst upgrades... Rock bottom floor around $192. Will continually add there until blow out ER and trailing eps is over 3.50/share. Yes p/e for a GROWTH company, not price to sales. This company has a war chest to grow."
WISH will catch upGuarantee
ETSY'S PROFITS ARE OVER 14%
wow..what a drop! I think it would be highest it could go....where will be the growth?
Should go lower than May $153
"We’ve just broken out of the downtrending channel that was formed on lower timeframes, rocket to 220$"
"Broke through $180, time for a lower target. Let’s try $175. Still the rest of today and tomorrow to get there. Hard to believe this was up 11 days in a row and over $207 earlier this month."
Finishing green today
This looks like similar reactions on the boards when SQ was down $30 AH. All the people came out of the woodworks and said sell it’s going to $150 ect. ETSY will be fine. Wouldn’t surprise me if it’s back to $185– $190 tomorrow. Great company and the women love to shop on there. That won’t change.
See you at 165.00
I thought this was etsy. Anyway all very well for wackos but alot of us don't get to save thousands every month and want to invest in other words not much to lose compared to multi millionaires.
This was looking better when it was over $197 a couple of hours ago. Even entertained a brief (very brief) thought of seeing $200 again. Best to wait.
Guess this pending down day was due. Sure liked it better up 12 days in a row.... so much for that $189 target published earlier this month.
"Will this get over $200 today, or just slide back down towards $195?"
"Etsy is greatly undervalued.It had strong earnings, and had dropped almost 30% before announcing earnings, which had already more than factored in. It further dropped 15% after announcement.Just because of no future guidance, the price is punished?Due to the current economic situation, which companies can really have a clear guidance?Think about it, this online company is the future itself."
Some mutual fund is buying. When that ends the price will drop to what?Have been in and out today profitably...
Incredibly obvious it would have the same movement as PINS on earnings
"Continue to buy every dip. If covid-19 gets worse (a more virulent strain equally transmissible) and if there are additional shutdowns, then this stock will outperform. Covid is a fall winter virus, so we can expect this one to outperform in the upcoming months."
I bought in this morning I hope it blows up big time.
"Worth $25B, just insane, $10B more than Amer Airlines"
Now is a good time for etsy to start their buyback.
Wimpy Mr market losing the plot. Earnings revenue to surprise. Opportunity to buy more shares at discount given many more buyers and sellers and new add on businesses
bought 500 tomorrow ETSY IS OVER 230.00
Until year over year comparisons get easier ETSY and the other e commerce names will be pounded on earnings. If you can hold on until this passes eventually guidance will cease to be dismal. But unless you’re like me and own at a very cheap price it might be wise to sell and wait for a better entry point.
Waiting for $170 to buy
Since major institutions own most stock I wonder what they will do IF earnings Aug 4 come below predictions? Or will they continue to pay 50+ PE?
Holding 180 puts. Yeah baby.
"Seems the trend (with any stock) is to sell prior to earnings, then scoop 'em up a day later at a steep discount regardless of how awesome earnings are."
Added a little more today
Headed to 220 HOLD
"“I kinda love Etsy"" - Elon Musk"
"Etsy should partner with Affirm financing, would be huge for both companies"
"It looks like we might be headed to 170$-175$ area, if your long don’t worry it’ll just be a healthy correction. Looking to load up some more around that area."
The way the stock is moving we could finish green.
Why
I confess to buying a lot on ebay but a little on etsy. I have made money buying and selling Etsy stock when it rises and selling short and covering when it falls. So what does ebay's new earnings indicate about etsy's next earnings? Ebay has a PE of 17X while Etsy is 52X.
"been holding for 2 years, i was going to sell but I realized that they are expanding. I will keep my shares."
does anyone think it will drop below 205?
"what is the reason for etsy up today? acquisition of some sort""? NO earnings report i know that."
"Look at it this way. In 2019 ETSY had revenues of $818.379 million. Trailing 12 months it now has revenues of 2,125,618 million (2.125 billion). That's up 160% in 18 months. If you smooth it out thegrowth rate is still great. Plus Depop etc acquisitions. In a year or so you'll get more normal comps. Short term pain, long term gain. Recall this wsas in the 160s just a couple of months ago. All part of the process if you are investing and not daytrading it."
Definitely one of the few companies I can trade confidently with I have been getting so much joy investing all because of my earnings Just perfect I have been telling everyone how they gave me a ray of hope after I thought I had lost it all now I have not only earned but also learned how to make market analysis Deriv trading platform has been helpful even to me as an old trader and mostly newbies out there I am still earning daily and growing my wallet monthly with Jame's Platform
In a few months or no time people we definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy bitcoin or invest in any cryptocurrency
I can bet as soon as market open Etsy will be back to 200
"I love shopping at Etsy, but retail has lost its luster lately. Ev is hot though, especially with it being funded by Congress. I like Tesla and ZEV, both high growth. ZEV is supplying Ford’s parts for EV. Some Volkswagen too."
Etsy is performing tremendously well!!!!
Back to 220$ 
"Well, Jim Cramer just had good things to say about ETSY..."
For what it’s worth... My etsy store traffic is up -106% YOY and on track to double last years sales as well. My guess is earnings will be a big beat.
I am done with my buying
I am a buyer tomorrow between 170-180. I am gonna have to retire early if market keeps throwing me this kind of deals.
Where are the shorts now? You should never bet against a company with solid fundamentals.
"Hold, it will be 300 by end of this year. Growth oriented company."
200$ on Monday!!!
Closing today at $195
"Numerous high flying stocks have been in a quiet correction for the last month or so. Some correcting after being clearly over bought, others just taking the pause that refreshes. None that I follow have shown downside deviation that would indicate a broken bullish trend. ETSY is a prime example of this."
Etsy went down to $130 the last time they reported. Earnings now were a triple miss that will likely send it below to around $120 and if market conditions worsen look out below.
Losing all my money. Help me
Ahhhh the sell off. Good news bad news no matter. I was in on the IPO at $14 so i don't care.
Already recovering. It will be at $180 in a few minutes and keep on recovering. I add more at $172.20
"ETSY will bounce back, this is a great company. It's so typical these days to have a solid company's stock goes down right after great earnings, will take a few months will be back in $200+"
"11 Green Days in a row, I guess it’s too late to add here "
Jeez. Will be interesting where we end up at close tomorrow... initial reactions are... aggressive.
Big Boys will be selling Etsy today to lock in gains.How low will it go over next 2 days before earnings? -- 170?
Headed to 225$ 
A good amount of short interest jumping back in after the open
$100 (13B Cap) very fair price target here 2B revenue with 400M Net it’s nothing
avoiding those covid stock like $PINS $UPWK $FVRR $ETSYMore reopenAlready overvalue A lot of them already up 200-300%
Much better finish to the day than was the start. Good when it goes up; better when it stays there.
Remember when $SNAP was at 4$ and $ETSY was at 7$. Don't miss this opportunity.
Etsy earnings will be excellent. 20 percent correction up by nextweek
Going back under 100$ where it belongs
"Why is is acceptable to discriminate and have women-owned business objectives but not man-owned? Time to stop the nonsense and stop dividing people up and let the best prevail, man-woman, black, whit, brown, yellow--whatever!

"I will never understand the sympathy trade. Ever. Two completely different companies, but because AMZN laid a turd you sell ETSY. Mmmkay. Whatever."
This is Much More Than An'ITSY' Bitsy.....
"When this inevitably crushes earnings and proceeds to drop 5% like everything else, I will be starting a position. If I had more capital I would buy now and add after earnings"
Off over $6 in pre-market. Guessing that rules out seeing $200 anytime soon.
to the moon !!!
AMZN already down -250 on revenue miss and projections. Worse to come tomorrow. ETSY will also get destroyed tomorrow. Bail now while you still can without losing your shirt.
"guidance was a miss, that's why it's down big"
This joke kicks butt on overall bad earnings. Yet Target is getting crushed after crushing their earnings call. The great companies get a haircut for doing well and the Etsys of the market get benefit of the doubt. I'm learning.
"ETSY has sold off after the last 6 earnings report. Probably beats top and bottom line today, Guidance strong but slower year over year. Sells on e commerce ""slow down"" profit taking"
We’ll hit 220$ by end of July
It’s going to be $175 at the EoD
"what is this after hours drop bs.??? This market is crazy. They beat earnings and revenue, then it drops 14% after hours???????? Just another buying opportunity I guess..."
this may continue to decline with reopening trades advancing look at other e-commerce all declining too. i wouldn't be a buyer until $80.
Who did not know that $25B was way over valued
Down in 8 of lsat 10 sessions. This splendid performance on the heels of 11 straight days in green. Like what has changed in two weeks? No one wants used expensive stuff anymore?
"Investing in cryptocurrency now is really cool, especially with current rise in the market for now."
"ETSY: 25B Cap, 450M Net revenue TBLA: 2B Cap, 1.2B revenue"
Today's Bull led up to a crash like I expected.
good buying opportunity?
Etsy will beat all online retailers in the future!
Etsy's time will come. The company is still poised for exponential growth
Basiscally not many new buyers going into the Etsy Ecosystem.........it's retail canabilizism .......
"""Expected Headwinds in the coming Quarter."""
Time will fix it all. Stay the course
This stock is tanking. I may buy tomorrow morning if it drops to $170
Got in at $184. Narrowing my loss.....
I heard about ETSY the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Longs, what is your long term vision for the Etsy? Where do you see it in 5 years? I like the company and their recent acquisitions are huge, but I have a hard time imagining what the future holds for the company. All of these hot tech stocks change our lives in some fashion - how is Etsy going to change our lives? I think in many ways it has found a spot somewhere between the giants of eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. It's really the only large marketplace where any artist, craftsperson, etc. can make a start and sell their products and the exciting part is this transcends national borders... puts everyone on a level playing field, and so in that regard I think Etsy could become life changing for many, but I am not sure how that translates into a stock."
"I wanted to buy at 176, tomorrow it may be the time "
After opening market Etsy will fully recover
"BUY by Jim Cramer, CNBC peeps, Today's price target at 217. Options expiring tomorrow ""bewitching"" friday, high volume call 5,105 vs puts 2,716 at strike price 180/s. My gut feeling is that this is going past 175 and heading to 180. GL"
$24 billion market cap. You've got to be kidding.
"""In the second quarter of 2019 we continued our momentum, posting 37% revenue growth and 43% growth in EBITDA versus prior year,"" said Rachel Glaser, Etsy, Inc. Chief Financial Officer. ""Our investments in product initiatives and full funnel marketing are having a positive impact on growth in both active buyers and sellers and continued sequential growth in our frequency metrics."
"Don’t feel so bad. I am here to cheer you up. Look at $fsly, $etsy, $uber down big afterhours. Thought it would make you feel better."
"Just a reminder that price tends to retest key levels it breaks out of which is what we’re currently experiencing, should see some green by tomorrow or the day after. Selling volume has also decreased. See you guys at 220$"
$WISH I didn't get in $PINS at $12I didn't get in $ETSY at $6 I didn't get in $SHOP at $20I didn't get in $AMZN at $37 so yeah I like $WISH under 10$ and I’m adding every pay biatches 
was a good buy market at the open congrats for those buying into fear
Red soon
"Slowing sales, lower guidance, PE over 60. I am out."
We ran too far too fast is all. Buy a company ready to make a hard rebound. QS. They reported and rose to over $25 but are down largely with the market. But it’s a pretty hot stock
Revenue Guidance Miss
"little bit expensive but great growth potential , will buy at 150 ."
aaaand….back to 180 in premarket hours. This is a great company to invest long term.
"Back above 200. I still recall how aggressively I was thumbs downed on the last ETSY quarter. Shorts were saying this stock was finished, that it's best days were behind it. Yet here we are 30 points later back above 200. Reopening is just a temporary situation. ETSY was thriving prior to COVID. All COVID did was rapidly speed up their growth into a big company. ETSY will be around long after the malls and companies like Macy's and Kohl's go bankrupt. Now that said I expect many thumbs downs from the ETSY bears who have been proven wrong as of late, but to hurt my feelings they are going to have to take away all the money I made from buying in the 160s. The chances of that happening are as likely as the Presidential election getting reversed."
"Why can $HOOD be up 80 percent and worth a trillion dollars, but a profitable company tanks. This market doesn’t care about growing profits. Same as PINS"
"does etsy accept payPal as a payment option, anyone know"
bought at 8 and might sell at 800 (probably not) when ETSY is the boutique store for the entire Western World...and who knows where else...their Reverb and Fashion acquisitions will likely add to the empire. Consider that rev comps beat at about 25% after 100% plus growth last quarters. Thus they excelled well beyond that initial massive Covid boost. Speaks volumes. Long term pass on to your generations stock. Adios Pelota
"Ha, just mass-blasted ""bubble"" spam not specifically related to ETSY, and nothing else posted today. Down on an up day, but then again, up on a down week last week. Seems to be backing and filling, gathering support."
Long horizon investor at $198. This blip doesn’t concern me one bit.
ETSY isn’t AMZN the CEO told the truth and guided down for this QTR and the Depop purchase was brilliant! I’m LONG and not giving up my shares to the shorts…..mark this comment for Wednesday
stock run up. NYC management. optics of fewer sales post Covid. CFO sells shares. buys another company. stock of acquirer goes up instead of down. financial deal for billion. a few facts. what is really in play here? their bubble?
"i'm buying, at least going to 250 end of this year"
We will see ETSY dropping like PINS after earnings!
Target $85
up 6% today so realistically we only went down 6% from yesterday
"Don’t be fooled by short sellers, hedgies will take it a dirt price.."
Back to 130.00
"What the…., drop 14%?"
Some big investor bought the dip
Cup and handle breakout. Sell off from the acquisition of the Brazilian e commerce company. Heading up to test the 220's
They didn't put up the great growth they had in the past. Not a big deal. Was anticipated. The acquisitions of depop and elo7 are going to be huge for them. Buying opportunity.
UP 6% today then down 13% after hours means it's only really down 7%... It's really not that serious...
"$ETSY started from $20s, dropped below $7 and within 5 years broke $200. Patience is key!"
Etsy is worst off than Amazon.......internet buying is cooling down .......but Amazon managed to double their fulfillment infastructure (It was already a monster).......Etsy was built for the moment......Amazon is always building for the future...
Why is the stock up?
24 hours until betting window closes before ER.... looks like 188s is the mean from 198s to 178s range.... some downward pressure built in... wait and see with a half position is warranted....
bEtsy PE 54 is overvalued
$Pins was the signal.. remember last quarter?
Wow now that was a massive seller. Just touched the 100SMA so now should fade remainder of day. I’m expecting a close below $185
"Be honest, I don't like their Brazil acquisitions. AMZON, Walmart fell into Brazil eCommerce."
"Well, it managed to get to $200. How long before it gets there and stays for longer than a minute or two?"
This is not Amazon
"Contrarian. Up big yesterday on a down day, down today on a huge up day. But up on the week, 3rd week in a row. More back and fill and consolidation."
easy back to $202
Dummies don’t understand that COVID numbers are soaring globally and we will move to more restrictions! Ppl don’t wear masks and more will be sick with flu as well. E-commerce will keep booming! ETSY is not going anywhere and not slowing down. Take advantage of the opportunity!
ETSY CEO impressive tonight on Mad Money. Proud to be an investor in this company.
This is easy 300 dollars a share.
They are so expensive.
"filling yesterdays gap down before earnings, i think. Should slide once (lake of) guidance is discussed on the call."
Thursday will see the $170’s.
WISH 5B cap has more revenue than this
why is this down so much today?
I’ve been telling you guys we were forming a cup and handle. This will quickly go to previous highs and my guess blow by them. Just keep watching.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Thetraderguide.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Wow sugar coating a turd with that report. 13% inc not so great at this valuation. At least Amazon was honest
"ETSY took a breather. On 12/02, it rejected the bears attempt to turn its pullback into a downward trend. I think you see a gap up Monday with a price change more in line with its ATR ($5-$7). And by Tuesday it hits 161, still a good swing trade for directional traders."

Buy guys buy you have nothing to loss it goes 200 easily .
ETSY is going to be the DIAMOND STOCK of the YEAR! ETSY's revenues grew 87% Quarter over Quarter. It grew over Q4 2019 (a retailers best quarter) by 59%. Do you think people are going to be shopping at malls this Fall (Christmas season) without a vaccine? NO WAY! ETSY will have another smashing quarter. Investors are realizing that this stock will be double before year-end. Don't miss-out on this opportunity. I am 100% vested.
Back to that $167-168 range again.
Dammm was a good decision to buy last night at 175!!
Watch what happens to GM if it drops below the 200ma tomorrow. Just a few cents away. It will bring the entire market down. The last time it dropped below the 200ma was July 2020
last one out please turn off the lights. thank you.
"Morgan Stanley has been negative Etsy for a while. They downgraded to underweight on 12/5/19 (and had previously been underweight a year or 2 before before equal weighting it) with a price target of $52 when Etsy was trading at $41.Thereafter maintained underweight with following targets:3/30/20 target $30 Etsy at $38.5/7/20 $43 target and Etsy at $767/16/20 $65 and $84.8/6/20 $68 and $130.10/29/20 $74 and $1321/15/21 $93 and $2042/26/21 $123 and $220.5/6/21 $135 and $1578/5/21 upgrade to equal weight, price target $163. ETSY bounces off morning lows and now at $187.Being underweight above $200 may have made some sense temporarily, and kudos for sticking to your guns in the face of a massive rally, but they chased the price with the price target all along. The ""advice"" was wrong."
"The only news I can find on ETSY is that NuWave Management, LLC purchased 1550 shares for an increased stake of $276000. That news hit the tape at 6:15 AM this morning. It doesn't seem to account for this kind of move but that's the only new news I can find. ETSY was one of the companies that banned services to our outgoing President but that would push the stock down, not up. I'll report more as soon as I can get more news. Either way I'm pleased it took out 200. Told you shorts to cover back in the 100s."
It does seem that Etsy’s best days are behind.
Thoughts on after hours plunge....
Has a long way to drop for value
This is a easy hold!!! set it and forget it.
"good thing is, the price is going up. Sad thing is, i find myself difficult to average down"
Nice follow up to the recently ended 11 days of green. Too bad the falling share price increments are about double those of the gains. Give it a week and it will correct itself back to the low $180’s.
"I've said for the longest time ETSY sells a ton of junk now. It's doesn't sell only exclusive, hand-made items like it once did. It's becoming like Ebay but with a nicer visual aesthetic. I sold my shares months ago and smile when I see it plunge now."
I mean we knew this would happen based off earnings from Amazon right 
"Hedges messing with AMC, AMD and now Etsy? No? Etsy is Hedges’ top 7 invested stock in the world.They are trying to FUD us to sell so they can buy for cheap prices."
Prime hour is pulling $ETSY still further down 
Weekly Closes last 6 weeks:5/7 $165.515/14 $163.115/21 $167.56.5/28 $164.736/4 $164.186/11 ? $165.16 (current price) S&P is essentially flat in that time as well. Consolidation.
It’s profit booking nothing more then that
rocket countdown started. to the moon we gooo!!
this will bounce back to $200 SO fast. don't miss out!
Great buying opportunity!
"Buy, thank me later!"
What happened to Post Market?
Added to my position today. Retesting cup and handle breakout level. Still looks good at this time.
"ETSY PE of 130x or EBAY PE of 20x? You may say, ""well Etsy is a growth stock."" It needs to triple it's revenue to make up for that multiple all without any real new product offerings or new tailwinds."
"I don’t understand how ETSY shorts think. Looking at the company’s financials there is nothing but stuff to like. Extremely high gross margins, profitable, free cash flow positive and more than enough net cash to pay down the entire debt. Tell me where the bear case is besides the PE ratio, which is the worst way to value a company like ETSY."
Fresh meat
Not sure how blowing the doors off earnings estimates but guidance a meet HALF a percent lower than the estimate equates to a 12% drop.
This company's earnings missed all of the 3 major analyst expectations which is a big deal. Be careful on this one it dipped to the 130s last time which earnings then were better than this quarter was expectation wise
Hahahaha where those shorts are now?????
"Go to etsy seller forum,many lightweight sellers are complaining they have no or little sales for silly stuff like badges,patches ,pins.The average sales of etsy seller they said is $223 a month and thats gross.many are stay at home mom so they dont have much of an overhead.Etsy did well selling masks,but thats over,and the stock price has yet to reflect that,it is not AMZN,Ebay,it does not have AWS,it will drop like a rock when sales decline.Unlike Ebay,when someone wants something practical,like a used laptop,camera,printer or tool,they can find it on ebay,but not on Etsy."
In Cathie Wood we trust ..earnings call will be record breaking easy LONG
Etsy is a steal rn ... bought today!
"Sold out of Etsy today, will be back when it comes down under 200"
ETSY is still trading at a 40-50% discount
"Second Quarter 2020 Consolidated Financial ResultsTotal revenue was $428.7 million for the second quarter of 2020, up 136.7% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both Marketplace and Services revenue. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2020 was $317.4 million, up 159.1% year-over-year, and gross margin was 74.0%, up 640 basis points compared with 67.6% in the second quarter of 2019. The expansion in gross margin was primarily driven by our shift to Offsite Ads, which drives revenue growth without an equal offset in cost of revenue. Total operating expenses were $198.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, up 89.4% year-over-year, and represented 46.2% of revenue, compared to 57.8% in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by our investments in marketing initiatives, including our shift to Offsite Ads where Etsy leverages its expertise and marketing budget to drive growth for sellers. Despite the increase in marketing spend, we gained leverage across our overall operating expenses. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $96.4 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.75. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $150.6 million and grew 279.4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e., non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) was 35.1% in the second quarter of 2020, up 1,320 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA performance was driven primarily by year-over-year revenue growth. Cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments were $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2020."
"One sold put 2 months out @185.00 would Pocket you 1,600 bucks. Easy money. Hope you took advantage of it."
or <200 tomorrow
Rule #1 in trading... NEVER EVER buy a stock that drops below the 200ma unless you hate money.
Etsy 200 this week
Covid relief rally?
Compare ETSY with MELI not with AMZNETSY is a $ 300 stock $ 250 Thurdsday
This board is swamped with spammers. Mute and report them.
"Still grossly overvalued, fair price is $120."
I cannot miss the day like this to buy
ER was good! Company profitable and showing growth. Cases of COVID going up so I expect more lockdowns. Etsy 300 $250 before EOY. Today will finish green
SNOW Wwas down on earning 10% and on market closed next day 5% up. I am going to enter Etsy tommrow as soon as market open
"The S&P phenomenon occurs when index funds and other investment vehicles tracking the S&P buy stocks in a company immediately after the S&P added it to its index. The price increase is mostly temporary, settling back down after S&P-related buying has subsided.In Etsy's case year-end Christmas shopping should keep the upward price trend."
Etsy is down 6.57% to 185.91
I will buy at $120
"With ETSY expanding into So America, should MELI be sold or hold? Thoughts?"
"Nice way to finish the week. Dive, Dive, Dive."
Exited yesterday. Considering re-entering today. Will then buy some more if it hits 165.
"CEO:""Sequential Decline in Buyers"" with a PE of 55 cannot hold."
"The pattern of Shorts is always the same.They compared $SNAP, $ETSY, and $SQ to $FB, $AMZN and $PYPL and said they would no longer grow.Think about it. When you sell stocks, Hedge funds are buying."
PE ratio above 50 means this is still grossly overvalued.
Checkout AMC the short squeeze is starting
Why would someone buy 6 blocks of Etsy at 174.50 a few minutes ago because Etsy is so oversold right now and will go up to at least 190.00 before 8 pm
Who else loaded up $CTRM amazing revenues let’s go!! Loaded up $SCR today too! HOLDING $GME $NOK
Etsy finally taking off. Let's take this to $250!!
Another up week. Ignore the day to day noise.
Slight set back.. will be back at 200 in a month.. Once fall and winter come the company will guide up for Christmas.. Give a day or two to settle and add to your position if you can or you can get in for the first time..
This is when I say ‘ I should’ve bought more when it was down’ Everytime
expected sell off based on past weeks action
Worth $27B IF YOU BELIEVE IT!
It’s recovering I told you it will recover fully when the market will open . Etsy has upwards trend now so it just a temporary correction
Etsy is already recovery and will be back at 180.00 in 5 minutes
Back off 10% from the $207.84 less than 2 weeks ago. Strong.
"All the shorts out on the board after one bad day. It's directly 1 year after the covid crash bottom so now investors can cash out with smaller tax consequences. There was bound to be profit taking. That does not affect the long term growth story. Next earnings will blow out and anyone avoiding e-commerce after massive stimulus is short sighted. When the sellers realize they aren't getting this stock any cheaper and it is different than covid stay at home stocks they will be back, and buying at a higher price. There are 1,500 institutions that own this stock... GL"
Sell sell sellll!!!!!
"Looks likea very slightly down week, after a string of up weeks, the last two quite strong. Back to consolidating, but at a higher level than the $160s it was stuck in. Etsy bucked the market downfall yesterday, and acted contrarian a bit on the up day. Still bullish."
Even Steve wonder could see this coming.
"Not today...,"
"DID anyone else notice? They all said ""Super excited"" over & over, on CC, as they reduced guidance. Trying to deflect. CEO just said it again! Deceleration in buyers but we are ""Really Excited""...CEO Josh Talks about helping sellers, as they screw them!"
y is this going down more than amazon?
Glad to be here
sell any strength!
I am a seller and I hate Etsy. They rip off the artist and just keep stealing our revenue. They have pushed us over the edge and sellers are looking for alternatives. Just look at the discussion on Reddit. all the sellers are dscussing leaving to go to a fair maketplace.I have no confidence in the management.
Lets take this bad boy to $250 by EOW.
"Outlook off by a few million, expected after the lockdown. Great company with years and years of growth "

Quiz: Which company shows +120 % yoy growth and its shares drop by 20% in 24 hours?
"Nice run up knock on wood. Hope this keeps on going on up to near $220. Some will start taking their profits, if they haven’t already. Will you? I am still on the fence with 750 shares."
Good news for ETSY about mask sales. Bad for the rest of us:https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/once-fading-mask-sales-starting-to-rebound/ar-AAMI1sy
Better start buying while the buying is good!!!
"Guys I was in shopify when it was at $180 and people in the discussion board would bash on how its overvalued and that it is in a bubble. Don't sell Etsy just because someone here is bashing the stock. The fact of the matter is that people here are not your financial advisor. The reason that 90% of people don't make money in the stock market is because they get too emotional. Think of your money being locked up for 5-10 year time frame, and i promise you that you will thank yourself in the future.  "
Etsy stock plunged after it reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates while guidance missed expectations.
this is a solid portion of the $BECKY portfolio. and BECKY's been dropping cash left and right$ETSY $SBUX $AAPL $LULU $PINS $FB
"Thumbs up if you bought ETSY’s 30 percent dip. You should be very pleased with your decision, I know I’m glad I bought."
why etsy is down 3% today?
Honey back up the truck if this hits below $165
what happened here???
The typical amateur retailer like myself did well here today.... sold on the first big up day and then the floor drops out...
$UBER $LYFT $ETSY $GM what else was down on Earning?
"Should get interesting, ETSY generates 4 times the profit AMZN does for the same growth in revenue. So if ETSY grows revenue half as fast as AMZN it will grow profits twice as fast. Yet now ETSY has a pe near 44 while AMZN is 62. Either AMZN is way too high, or ETSY is way too low."
Ouchies after hours....
Have to admit folks ETSY earnings are in a downward trend. Great company but until more lockdowns are happening the stock will drift lower.
"ETSY bears thumbs down my bullish comments a lot, but the only way they'll succeed at hurting my feelings is if they can take away all my money I've made since investing last year. ETSY is a good company that helps small businesses. The CEO is excellent, and the company is ethically sound. I fail to understand where the bear case lies in ETSY. The short float is only 6.5%. That's a tiny minority of bears. So bottom line, they can thumbs down all they wish. All they do is reaffirm their stupidity me. ETSY will continue go up, the bears will do whatever it is bears do when they are losing. Shorts should've covered in the 160s. That is beyond debate."
everyone is loading back up just grabbed 200 shares
In a few months or no time people will definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrency
There’s another insanely large sell block. This is so bearish at this point. VWAP is at $185.66. This should retest it at the minimum.
Good luck timing the market to all who sold
Etsy will continue to have great earnings and excellent management. I truly see this company flourishing in the next decade
"Over reaction , what a gift, buy"
Found upgrade at Neadham $250 pt
Share news this is ready to double.
I took my profits and sold today.
Great recovery.. shows strength and believe
"Time to short ETSY, it will likely drop below the 200ma today in the 184.00 area with almost no support under. gl longs"
"BEtsy Is Overvalued. They have reduced Guidance and ""The addition of new businesses creates a contraction by 300 Basis Points""."
"this is just shorts action in hopes you sell, set your sell orders over 200.00 and load up"
"July is not looking nearly as nice as was June. What now, down 11 days in a row to even things out? Too bad the drops are bigger than the gains."
Lol
"Really wild fluctuations recently. I'm long and plan on holding for while, but this ahead of earnings is kind of strange. Drops on PIN's earnings last week after running back up to 210, now back up 7% before ER, when management already said the growth pace will be hard to keep up with Covid comps from last year. Love it long term but suspicious. Oh well, back where it was in late July."
Bought at $160 sold at $208 thanks for the tendies Etsy 
Been a shareholder for about a month— didn’t sell at $206 and rode it down but riding it back up. I think I’ll hold this winner for about 3-5 years barring a catastrophic disaster! Etsy should be in everyone’s portfolio — maybe Amazon’s little brother/sister in the future…..?
Hold strong! Up again soon!
Back to 165 level?
Time to buy more
I thought of selling the stock before the earnings rpt. But I didn't
"sold all mine to cash in now... don't like their brazil acquisition and it is going to fail... Both Walmart and Amazon did bad and sold their brail ecommerce business. With the growth rate is low, I am out for right now. Good luck to all"
"If we wipe out the dip before the end of the day, I will be extremely grateful to the option gods."
