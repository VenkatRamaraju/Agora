For what it’s worth... My etsy store traffic is up -106% YOY and on track to double last years sales as well. My guess is earnings will be a big beat.
"Still grossly overvalued, fair price is $120."
Good luck timing the market to all who sold
shouldn't be getting this much love
"“I kinda love Etsy"" - Elon Musk"
SNOW Wwas down on earning 10% and on market closed next day 5% up. I am going to enter Etsy tommrow as soon as market open
We ran too far too fast is all. Buy a company ready to make a hard rebound. QS. They reported and rose to over $25 but are down largely with the market. But it’s a pretty hot stock
-$70 after hours
"The S&P phenomenon occurs when index funds and other investment vehicles tracking the S&P buy stocks in a company immediately after the S&P added it to its index. The price increase is mostly temporary, settling back down after S&P-related buying has subsided.In Etsy's case year-end Christmas shopping should keep the upward price trend."
"Morgan Stanley has been negative Etsy for a while. They downgraded to underweight on 12/5/19 (and had previously been underweight a year or 2 before before equal weighting it) with a price target of $52 when Etsy was trading at $41.Thereafter maintained underweight with following targets:3/30/20 target $30 Etsy at $38.5/7/20 $43 target and Etsy at $767/16/20 $65 and $84.8/6/20 $68 and $130.10/29/20 $74 and $1321/15/21 $93 and $2042/26/21 $123 and $220.5/6/21 $135 and $1578/5/21 upgrade to equal weight, price target $163. ETSY bounces off morning lows and now at $187.Being underweight above $200 may have made some sense temporarily, and kudos for sticking to your guns in the face of a massive rally, but they chased the price with the price target all along. The ""advice"" was wrong."
Bought in at open. Safest stock in my portfolio
Look at the shorties who are sad that a solid company is doing well.
"Longs, what is your long term vision for the Etsy? Where do you see it in 5 years? I like the company and their recent acquisitions are huge, but I have a hard time imagining what the future holds for the company. All of these hot tech stocks change our lives in some fashion - how is Etsy going to change our lives? I think in many ways it has found a spot somewhere between the giants of eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. It's really the only large marketplace where any artist, craftsperson, etc. can make a start and sell their products and the exciting part is this transcends national borders... puts everyone on a level playing field, and so in that regard I think Etsy could become life changing for many, but I am not sure how that translates into a stock."
Etsy earnings will be excellent. 20 percent correction up by nextweek
Not sure how blowing the doors off earnings estimates but guidance a meet HALF a percent lower than the estimate equates to a 12% drop.
Back to 130.00
below 120$ stock
125.00 stock
"CEO:""Sequential Decline in Buyers"" with a PE of 55 cannot hold."
Way Over Valued inIMO
Thoughts on after hours plunge....
I confess to buying a lot on ebay but a little on etsy. I have made money buying and selling Etsy stock when it rises and selling short and covering when it falls. So what does ebay's new earnings indicate about etsy's next earnings? Ebay has a PE of 17X while Etsy is 52X.
Etsy finally taking off. Let's take this to $250!!
PE ratio above 50 means this is still grossly overvalued.
to the moon !!!
Is Etsy starting to break down?
UP 6% today then down 13% after hours means it's only really down 7%... It's really not that serious...
Prime hour is pulling $ETSY still further down 
They are so expensive.
Etsy stock plunged after it reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates while guidance missed expectations.
Red soon
last one out please turn off the lights. thank you.
Basiscally not many new buyers going into the Etsy Ecosystem.........it's retail canabilizism .......
"Lol, this is why I hate corrupt hedges. They are trying to crush the share prices down so that retail investors sell them in cheap prices and hfs #$%$ them.Hold and keep buying."
Volume's drying up they need new money to step in
Exited yesterday. Considering re-entering today. Will then buy some more if it hits 165.
Bought at $160 sold at $208 thanks for the tendies Etsy 
Revenue Guidance Miss
I will buy at $120
Closing today at $195
"""In the second quarter of 2019 we continued our momentum, posting 37% revenue growth and 43% growth in EBITDA versus prior year,"" said Rachel Glaser, Etsy, Inc. Chief Financial Officer. ""Our investments in product initiatives and full funnel marketing are having a positive impact on growth in both active buyers and sellers and continued sequential growth in our frequency metrics."
"Really wild fluctuations recently. I'm long and plan on holding for while, but this ahead of earnings is kind of strange. Drops on PIN's earnings last week after running back up to 210, now back up 7% before ER, when management already said the growth pace will be hard to keep up with Covid comps from last year. Love it long term but suspicious. Oh well, back where it was in late July."
Buy guys buy you have nothing to loss it goes 200 easily .
What happened to Post Market?
Rule #1 in trading... NEVER EVER buy a stock that drops below the 200ma unless you hate money.
Glad to be here
Long horizon investor at $198. This blip doesn’t concern me one bit.
"Sold out of Etsy today, will be back when it comes down under 200"
Dummies don’t understand that COVID numbers are soaring globally and we will move to more restrictions! Ppl don’t wear masks and more will be sick with flu as well. E-commerce will keep booming! ETSY is not going anywhere and not slowing down. Take advantage of the opportunity!
"sell , sell strong sell"
Etsy is worst off than Amazon.......internet buying is cooling down .......but Amazon managed to double their fulfillment infastructure (It was already a monster).......Etsy was built for the moment......Amazon is always building for the future...

"Second Quarter 2020 Consolidated Financial ResultsTotal revenue was $428.7 million for the second quarter of 2020, up 136.7% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both Marketplace and Services revenue. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2020 was $317.4 million, up 159.1% year-over-year, and gross margin was 74.0%, up 640 basis points compared with 67.6% in the second quarter of 2019. The expansion in gross margin was primarily driven by our shift to Offsite Ads, which drives revenue growth without an equal offset in cost of revenue. Total operating expenses were $198.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, up 89.4% year-over-year, and represented 46.2% of revenue, compared to 57.8% in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by our investments in marketing initiatives, including our shift to Offsite Ads where Etsy leverages its expertise and marketing budget to drive growth for sellers. Despite the increase in marketing spend, we gained leverage across our overall operating expenses. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $96.4 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.75. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $150.6 million and grew 279.4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e., non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) was 35.1% in the second quarter of 2020, up 1,320 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA performance was driven primarily by year-over-year revenue growth. Cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments were $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2020."

Looks like it'll be a 4th up week in a row.
"Reverb is partnered up with Affirm, Etsy should be too !"
"Don’t feel so bad. I am here to cheer you up. Look at $fsly, $etsy, $uber down big afterhours. Thought it would make you feel better."
"I sell on Etsy and was initially excited about star seller which rates on being 95% across messages, shipping, and rating. This I thought was also a reason to buy more stock as they clamp down on late shippers. Unfortunately, a 4 star rating counts the same as a 1 star rating. So anytime I get a four star rating, I'm locked out of star seller rating for 3 months. Not sure why etsy wouldn't average ratings, but at least now I don't have to overly worry about shipping or responding to messages until it resets next month."
Holidays are coming up and these guys will do well.

"Continue to buy every dip. If covid-19 gets worse (a more virulent strain equally transmissible) and if there are additional shutdowns, then this stock will outperform. Covid is a fall winter virus, so we can expect this one to outperform in the upcoming months."

Its times like these that you realize most people are just day traders and out to make a quick buck. Its been proven time and time again that buy and hold investors make more than people who go in and out of the market

"BEtsy Is Overvalued. They have reduced Guidance and ""The addition of new businesses creates a contraction by 300 Basis Points""."
why is this down so much today?
Been in forever but added on the last pullback. Why is up today so much ? maybe it time for covered calls
"Seems the trend (with any stock) is to sell prior to earnings, then scoop 'em up a day later at a steep discount regardless of how awesome earnings are."
I thought of selling the stock before the earnings rpt. But I didn't
Does it go as low as $125?
"Ha, just mass-blasted ""bubble"" spam not specifically related to ETSY, and nothing else posted today. Down on an up day, but then again, up on a down week last week. Seems to be backing and filling, gathering support."
Even Steve wonder could see this coming.
Why everytime a stock tanks everyone say oh its the hedgies oh its the shorts. It's ppl selling that's it. Earnings came out although they were pretty good it still showed slowed growth and sellers sold nothing wrong with that. Longs would be smart to get puts here or have sold secure puts earlier today. Still a great company and will show continous growth for longs.
Back to $170....or lower ???
They didn't put up the great growth they had in the past. Not a big deal. Was anticipated. The acquisitions of depop and elo7 are going to be huge for them. Buying opportunity.

Not a bad day... all things considered.

After opening market Etsy will fully recover
"ETSY has sold off after the last 6 earnings report. Probably beats top and bottom line today, Guidance strong but slower year over year. Sells on e commerce ""slow down"" profit taking"
"How could this stock trade at a PE of 65? ETSY seems very overbought; it appears that some will take very painful losses when reality hits. Similar to Virgin Galactic, SPCE, down over 15% today."
Not sure what caused the spike today. Did I miss some news?
or <200 tomorrow
"My YOY 30 day sales on etsy are flat, after last years 1-4X increase for the same measurement. My other online channels are up 7x this year, so not an online thing. Perhaps etsy isn't gaining eyeballs? A modest 10% increase in views. My personal theory is lack of more than 2 configuration drop boxes. This limitation alone is costing Etsy 40K alone for just my shop by limiting to customers who like email conversations to get what they want. Another is lack of shipping time enforcement. I feel bad as I got my start on Etsy, but man they are dropping the ball. How much money does it take in R&D to add drop boxes and list a shippers delivery on time rate? I could probably add that code over a couple weekends, but now I have to go hire some people to fulfill orders for the other sales channels."
Have to admit folks ETSY earnings are in a downward trend. Great company but until more lockdowns are happening the stock will drift lower.
Why would someone buy 6 blocks of Etsy at 174.50 a few minutes ago because Etsy is so oversold right now and will go up to at least 190.00 before 8 pm
Some mutual fund is buying. When that ends the price will drop to what?Have been in and out today profitably...
Has a long way to drop for value
Holding 180 puts. Yeah baby.
"The all time Low for Etsy was $6.04. Look at the Mkt cap vs revenue. With this major hit, the risk returns is now really imbalanced."
"sold all mine to cash in now... don't like their brazil acquisition and it is going to fail... Both Walmart and Amazon did bad and sold their brail ecommerce business. With the growth rate is low, I am out for right now. Good luck to all"
"Also should checkPAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF and MVST! It's great opportunity to buy and make nice money!"
Such a quite winner over last month
"this is just shorts action in hopes you sell, set your sell orders over 200.00 and load up"
Easy money with etsy
It is obvious etsy gets hit for ot sky high increase year on year but should allow God pandemic and considering that the results are very good. Compared to 2019 190 percent increase and no allowance for masks 30 percent increase so next yeat should make for improved comparisons especially when revenue from new companies kick in. Good time to time codt or add to positions for multinsg returns but ca not expect like lady year once on life opportunoty to catch 2 to 3 years growth in 6 to 9 months
"One sold put 2 months out @185.00 would Pocket you 1,600 bucks. Easy money. Hope you took advantage of it."

Time to take some profits.
bought at 8 and might sell at 800 (probably not) when ETSY is the boutique store for the entire Western World...and who knows where else...their Reverb and Fashion acquisitions will likely add to the empire. Consider that rev comps beat at about 25% after 100% plus growth last quarters. Thus they excelled well beyond that initial massive Covid boost. Speaks volumes. Long term pass on to your generations stock. Adios Pelota
Some big investor bought the dip
Great recovery.. shows strength and believe
what happened here???
Lets take this bad boy to $250 by EOW.
$100 (13B Cap) very fair price target here 2B revenue with 400M Net it’s nothing
sell any strength!
"Worth $25BB, $11BB more than AAL, sure! Maybe at $66"
$ZM $PTON earning get dump again just like every other work from home stocks. $FVRR $UPWK $PINS $ETSY
I am a seller and I hate Etsy. They rip off the artist and just keep stealing our revenue. They have pushed us over the edge and sellers are looking for alternatives. Just look at the discussion on Reddit. all the sellers are dscussing leaving to go to a fair maketplace.I have no confidence in the management.
This joke kicks butt on overall bad earnings. Yet Target is getting crushed after crushing their earnings call. The great companies get a haircut for doing well and the Etsys of the market get benefit of the doubt. I'm learning.
I mean we knew this would happen based off earnings from Amazon right 
is this a good buying opportunity? why did it drop so much today
Etsy went down to $130 the last time they reported. Earnings now were a triple miss that will likely send it below to around $120 and if market conditions worsen look out below.
"Take notice of e-commerce's larger growth trend, instead of focusing on daily coronavirus news. E-commerce sales accounted for just 11% of U.S. retail sales last year and now make up 16% of sales. Even before the pandemic, e-commerce sales were growing quickly as more retailers realized that they needed to reach consumers online, as well as in person. All of which means that, even with a coronavirus vaccine, it's very unlikely that consumers will suddenly drop the convenience of online shopping."
Incredibly obvious it would have the same movement as PINS on earnings
"Well, Jim Cramer just had good things to say about ETSY..."
"Stocks down big today are $lmnd, $etsy, $uber, $fsly, $gm, $roku, $lyft, $sklz. I own none of these. Feel better lcid is not down that much. Lcid will bleed slowly."
$ETSY all in. this easy money. scare and buy cheap shares. I'll take them.
This company's earnings missed all of the 3 major analyst expectations which is a big deal. Be careful on this one it dipped to the 130s last time which earnings then were better than this quarter was expectation wise
It’s going to be $175 at the EoD
Honey back up the truck if this hits below $165
"Should get interesting, ETSY generates 4 times the profit AMZN does for the same growth in revenue. So if ETSY grows revenue half as fast as AMZN it will grow profits twice as fast. Yet now ETSY has a pe near 44 while AMZN is 62. Either AMZN is way too high, or ETSY is way too low."
Where are the shorts now? You should never bet against a company with solid fundamentals.
Why is the stock up?
In Cathie Wood we trust ..earnings call will be record breaking easy LONG
Compare ETSY with MELI not with AMZNETSY is a $ 300 stock $ 250 Thurdsday
ER was good! Company profitable and showing growth. Cases of COVID going up so I expect more lockdowns. Etsy 300 $250 before EOY. Today will finish green
"I've said for the longest time ETSY sells a ton of junk now. It's doesn't sell only exclusive, hand-made items like it once did. It's becoming like Ebay but with a nicer visual aesthetic. I sold my shares months ago and smile when I see it plunge now."
In since 8. Wake me up at 300. Then 400....then much higher. Will be one of the most profitable and biggest ecommerce companies in the world.
Beat on both revenue & EPS. Silly selling rn. This will bounce back.
PE 64 …way overvalued
"""Expected Headwinds in the coming Quarter."""
Sold my shares... I am not buying ETSY at a PE of 64! I will wait until it is reasonable; it is currently way overpriced!
It’s recovering I told you it will recover fully when the market will open . Etsy has upwards trend now so it just a temporary correction
This looks like similar reactions on the boards when SQ was down $30 AH. All the people came out of the woodworks and said sell it’s going to $150 ect. ETSY will be fine. Wouldn’t surprise me if it’s back to $185– $190 tomorrow. Great company and the women love to shop on there. That won’t change.
"good thing is, the price is going up. Sad thing is, i find myself difficult to average down"
Until year over year comparisons get easier ETSY and the other e commerce names will be pounded on earnings. If you can hold on until this passes eventually guidance will cease to be dismal. But unless you’re like me and own at a very cheap price it might be wise to sell and wait for a better entry point.
I am done with my buying
Etsy will continue to have great earnings and excellent management. I truly see this company flourishing in the next decade
$pins $upwk $fvrr $etsy The Great Reset
expected sell off based on past weeks action
does anyone think it will drop below 205?
this will bounce back to $200 SO fast. don't miss out!
"Look at it this way. In 2019 ETSY had revenues of $818.379 million. Trailing 12 months it now has revenues of 2,125,618 million (2.125 billion). That's up 160% in 18 months. If you smooth it out thegrowth rate is still great. Plus Depop etc acquisitions. In a year or so you'll get more normal comps. Short term pain, long term gain. Recall this wsas in the 160s just a couple of months ago. All part of the process if you are investing and not daytrading it."
Etsy is up 6.61% to 215.65
The typical amateur retailer like myself did well here today.... sold on the first big up day and then the floor drops out...
up 6% today so realistically we only went down 6% from yesterday
aaaand….back to 180 in premarket hours. This is a great company to invest long term.
I can bet as soon as market open Etsy will be back to 200
"Rolling correction in the go-go growth stocks of 2020, so even with S&P slightly up, Etsy down over 4% (now over 5%), ABNB down 5%+, CRWD 4.5%, DDOG down 3.2%, ZS 3.5, DOCU 2.5, Trade Desk down 4%, TWLO 2.5%. Just to name a few but you can see yourself for names you may follow. Many stocks in correction, and S&P couldn't hold attempted gains Friday, and today, Monday, September 13, 2021 looks like it isn't going to hold the morning pop. Likely the correction will move on to those bigger caps as well.I am bullish on ETSY over the longer term, but looks like market is weak right now and people are selling. Add if you like although not sure you need to be in a hurry. I added some in the Spring at $206 and it's been a ride down and back, now down on that buy again, although way up on my buys in Spring of 2020, some of which I sold along the way."
"Outlook off by a few million, expected after the lockdown. Great company with years and years of growth "

“New User Growth Decelerates Abruptly”
Definitely one of the few companies I can trade confidently with I have been getting so much joy investing all because of my earnings Just perfect I have been telling everyone how they gave me a ray of hope after I thought I had lost it all now I have not only earned but also learned how to make market analysis Deriv trading platform has been helpful even to me as an old trader and mostly newbies out there I am still earning daily and growing my wallet monthly with Jame's Platform
Finishing green today
"Contrarian. Up big yesterday on a down day, down today on a huge up day. But up on the week, 3rd week in a row. More back and fill and consolidation."
ETSY isn’t AMZN the CEO told the truth and guided down for this QTR and the Depop purchase was brilliant! I’m LONG and not giving up my shares to the shorts…..mark this comment for Wednesday
"ETSY will bounce back, this is a great company. It's so typical these days to have a solid company's stock goes down right after great earnings, will take a few months will be back in $200+"
"guidance was a miss, that's why it's down big"
"its all just noise, long term Etsy is king "
It does seem that Etsy’s best days are behind.
I bought in this morning I hope it blows up big time.
"Why can $HOOD be up 80 percent and worth a trillion dollars, but a profitable company tanks. This market doesn’t care about growing profits. Same as PINS"
"Investing in cryptocurrency now is really cool, especially with current rise in the market for now."
I heard about ETSY the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Slowing sales, lower guidance, PE over 60. I am out."
Etsy and Wish are now working together on the future!
The way the stock is moving we could finish green.
was a good buy market at the open congrats for those buying into fear
Grip it and rip itGame changerBeen saying since 8 a share
Anybody know why Etsy is down on a very up day?
"Worth $26BB, NEVER"
Etsy partnership with Wish Contextlogic 
"Hedges messing with AMC, AMD and now Etsy? No? Etsy is Hedges’ top 7 invested stock in the world.They are trying to FUD us to sell so they can buy for cheap prices."
Overvalued at PE 63. Lower sales and less engagement. Look out below.
We will see ETSY dropping like PINS after earnings!
I think lot of people shorted this stock based on media saying bad earning
"Arkw bought 48,071 shares today. definitely a buy price."
"what is the reason for etsy up today? acquisition of some sort""? NO earnings report i know that."
See lots of bears here... you don’t sell a good company
I am a buyer tomorrow between 170-180. I am gonna have to retire early if market keeps throwing me this kind of deals.
easy back to $202
