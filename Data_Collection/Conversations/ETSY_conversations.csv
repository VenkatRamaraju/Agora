"Do not look at the stock's price. Look at the company. If you believe in the company, then stay long, and do not pay attention to the price of stock. $PINS Pinterest, is a brand name. Like $FB $SNAP $EBAY $ETSY Pinterest, is a digital market place. It is a marketing billboard.I congecture there will be a lot of interested parties to marry Pinterest. ""If"" $Pypl, supposedly showed desire to explore. There will be more explorers. There was a time of SPACs. Now, the time of Mergers & Acquisitions. Even, IF Pins drops to below $40 That would be great. Smart money will start grabbing it like hungry Vultures, in African Savanas. If you are an investor, dollar cost average pins. If you are a bag holder. Do the same. Dollar cost average. Do not buy stock, As Buffet says, buy the company.Volatility is part of the investments. With great news and Positive ER, price will jump back to 60s in a matter of Days.Best regards to ALL"
bad time to sell online retailer stocks like ETSY.Holiday season is just around the corner...the stock will continue its climb.
really amazing this #$%$ stays above $10 no uses etsy
"Rolling correction in the go-go growth stocks of 2020, so even with S&P slightly up, Etsy down over 4% (now over 5%), ABNB down 5%+, CRWD 4.5%, DDOG down 3.2%, ZS 3.5, DOCU 2.5, Trade Desk down 4%, TWLO 2.5%. Just to name a few but you can see yourself for names you may follow. Many stocks in correction, and S&P couldn't hold attempted gains Friday, and today, Monday, September 13, 2021 looks like it isn't going to hold the morning pop. Likely the correction will move on to those bigger caps as well.I am bullish on ETSY over the longer term, but looks like market is weak right now and people are selling. Add if you like although not sure you need to be in a hurry. I added some in the Spring at $206 and it's been a ride down and back, now down on that buy again, although way up on my buys in Spring of 2020, some of which I sold along the way."
but thats tomorrow
Not sure what caused the spike today. Did I miss some news?
"I sell on Etsy and was initially excited about star seller which rates on being 95% across messages, shipping, and rating. This I thought was also a reason to buy more stock as they clamp down on late shippers. Unfortunately, a 4 star rating counts the same as a 1 star rating. So anytime I get a four star rating, I'm locked out of star seller rating for 3 months. Not sure why etsy wouldn't average ratings, but at least now I don't have to overly worry about shipping or responding to messages until it resets next month."

Back to $170....or lower ???
"How could this stock trade at a PE of 65? ETSY seems very overbought; it appears that some will take very painful losses when reality hits. Similar to Virgin Galactic, SPCE, down over 15% today."
net income trending down last 3 quarters and PE is trending up. Sounds like trouble. Typical big run up until after earnings.
sold my shares 4 a good profit waiting it should go back under 200
Holidays are coming up and these guys will do well.
Watch out. Wish is coming 
Etsy and Wish are now working together on the future!
"$PINS is a combination of $EBAY $ANZN and $ETSY to name a few. People do not realize it yet.Pinterest, is a platform for all. Every retail wants to be there.It's just a beginning. Pins is in the basement build up, of a skyscraper. Profit is growing. DAU are irrelevant. Pareto effect states, 80% of wealth belongs 20% of people.20% of Pins users generate 80% of profits.. the rest are just browsers. Pinterest is not a good company, it is a Great company, Company with great concept. It is branding itself now, worldwideBuy it now in circa $50.Put it away for 5 years, then look it up.Best regards to all."
Sold my shares... I am not buying ETSY at a PE of 64! I will wait until it is reasonable; it is currently way overpriced!

I told you guys not to sell a good company and I got downvoted into oblivion...
Tearing up over all this boards shorts. 
Etsy going to have supply problems
Christmas IS coming and these are appr. current PE of stocks which SHOULD benefit: ETSY 70X; WMT 42X; EBAY 25X; DG 21X; TGT 20X; M 16X; DDS 11X; KSS 10X. But so are ETSY earnings after market Nov 3.Will institutions which own almost 90% of shares dump to bring PE more in line?
Is Etsy starting to break down?
In since 8. Wake me up at 300. Then 400....then much higher. Will be one of the most profitable and biggest ecommerce companies in the world.
Time to take some profits.
Way Over Valued inIMO
Lol I haven’t checked this board in a like a month… all these shorts in here. 65 PE is a STEAL with this growth trajectory. No need for pumping cause it’s just true! Lol
The MM on this stock is a real piece of work!
"Worth $25BB, $11BB more than AAL, sure! Maybe at $66"
See lots of bears here... you don’t sell a good company
1 Year ago i wrote about Etsy & Pinterest. at the Time Etsy was 25B and PINS 40B . It was about when ETSI will pass PINS value . So today is the day .

holiday season sending Etsy to the moon
"My YOY 30 day sales on etsy are flat, after last years 1-4X increase for the same measurement. My other online channels are up 7x this year, so not an online thing. Perhaps etsy isn't gaining eyeballs? A modest 10% increase in views. My personal theory is lack of more than 2 configuration drop boxes. This limitation alone is costing Etsy 40K alone for just my shop by limiting to customers who like email conversations to get what they want. Another is lack of shipping time enforcement. I feel bad as I got my start on Etsy, but man they are dropping the ball. How much money does it take in R&D to add drop boxes and list a shippers delivery on time rate? I could probably add that code over a couple weekends, but now I have to go hire some people to fulfill orders for the other sales channels."
As a holder for years and promoter (feel free to read comments) I feel enticed both to take profit and to hold. I love this company long term regardless if the Depop acquisition works out but I'm very excited and/or concerned to get more details on how the acquisition is materializing and how long it will take to be accretive. I think I'm trimming shares and adding some upside options. Ark/woods also bought in around $160 and at some point those players will take profit. Any thoughts from other long termers? No this is not a short ploy. The answer as why I wouldn't hold if I'm a long termer is I don't want to take another hit like the $230 to 160 drop and like to keep my cash working.
