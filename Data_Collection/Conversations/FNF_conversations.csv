How in the world is this stock selling off.. Its really hard to find a company this good.
"The safety and intrinsic value of This Company is exceptional. Altough I can only afford a few shares, im proud to say that im an official stakeholder in This Company and I am very positive about the Outlook of this Company"
why the drop with such great earnings and a bump in dividend?
I am a mortgage broker. I use FNF for most of my refinance escrow. Last quarter I closed 119 loans which is 4 times of my normal volume. The escrow officer was so busy. They cannot handle the volume. Go FNF
New 52 week high yesterday! Nice....... We just need more retail investors to discover us.
"Cash cow!! Per earnings report, ""For the month of January, total orders opened were over 8,800 per day, with a steady increase each week and nearly 10,500 orders opened per day in the first week of February."" Now keep in mind that March daily orders likely jumped to over 12,000/day, and I am being conservative. Share price is down over 30% from 52 week high, yet, 2020 profit will be well above 2019. This stock is so undervalued today!! Buy, buy and buy more!! I bet we are above $40/share by May and approaching $50/share by July, and this will still be undervalued with a P/E of 10!!"
Why down? Great earnings..Thoughts?
"I don't look at this as being a ""financial"" stock. To me, it is play on the vibrant housing market. New construction? They are involved. Existing housing? They are involved. Refinance? They are involved. Their business is involved in any Real Estate transaction that needs to be recorded at the court house.Money printing machine!!!"
"Investors in FNF doesn't seem to understand the impact of an anticipated Fed rate hike on the business of FNF. There is a difference between short rates and long rates. The Fed indicates that it will raise the benchmark short rate. There is a purpose to this -- to reduce inflation expectations. This reduction REDUCES the long rates. That is why 10-year treasury rate is falling today. Most mortgages are based on fixed long rates. This is good for both the new mortgages and refinancing. Moreover, new mortgages will switch even more from adjustable (short) rates to fixed (long) rates. To be sure, falling long rates is not favorable to FNF's annuity business. But the overall effect should remain positive. There is no rational reason why FNF should fall from $47+ to $44+."
if your here after the result and still holding hit like to see how many FNF holders still out there.
Will be up at least 10% in one month after 2nd quarter earnings are released.
Fidelity National Financial reached an all time high at 50.45
I would like to buy this stock as it should be safe given they make money off buying and selling stock and a lot of that is going on right now. What am I missing?
the competitors got thit tootreasury bonds rising causing it?
"FAF earnings announcement today with revenue growing 15% yoy but earnings slightly dropped. FAF share price dropped 10% so far, and FNF is being affected, dropping 3%. FAF actually has very good growth and improving margin in its core title business, and the disappointing result can be entirely explained by a $73Mil asset impairment in its non-core property and casualty business segment, which FAF now decides to sell.I don't think the market is acting rationally because FNF doesn't even have a property and casualty business."
"Going to blow way past analysts expectations again......... without any doubt and will again next qtr....... what's holding the price back from a $20 pick up is the perceived housing collapse, but that just is not going to happen anytime in the near future, People working from home even without a salary increase from pre pandemic have an additional 20% in their pockets just from less expenses overall from working from home......... as long as there is a housing market FNF will fly....... and it's still below Pre pandemic highs which is ridiculous.... I bot big in March 20 and then again June...... even picked up more last qtr....... dividend up to 36C love my FNF... the gift that keeps on giving baby!"
What happened at close of business today? Market up huge all day and Fidelity was also up till the last hour and then it's price fell off a cliff while the overall market finished up 829 points. Talk about possible price manipulation. Anyone know what happened?
"Honestly don't understand the steady SP decline here, PE 5.70, FNF has beat EPS est. for the last eight quarters, with 2Q21 EPS est. blowout @ +$.64, and Barclays recently adjusted Price Target to $63 From $58, Keeps Overweight Rating. "
This looks like a little gem...Too bad only 2 analysts follow the company...
"The drop on Friday's close was due to a big sell imbalance - it was options expiration day. Usually after such a move only caused by the imbalance, the stock returns back up."
"Is anyone else having trouble transferring their brokerage account to Fidelity? Fidelity's transfer progress monitor shows an estimated completion date of 2/18/21, but the transfer is still hanging, indicating that the old brokerage hasn't yet reviewed or processed the transfer request. But when I spoke with the old brokerage, they said they approved the transfer.What is going on with Fidelity???"
"FNF competitor, stewart title, recently announced blowout earningsFNF earnings come out Feb 24"
11% increase in dividend.
"I swear this is the least popular stock ever for a well run cash machine. Kill earnings estimate which kept revising up (better than previous Corona estimates), beat revenue, 6.4% revenue increase from q1 last year. Well at least we get 5.15% dividends. You'd need to go buy oil companies and deal with their negative oil prices for this kind of yield"
"Well, I thought it would end up 3% up instead of this witchery. However, at some point (especially when valuations of many companies are up in the ozone) people are going to want to invest in companies who actually make money and aren't overpriced. FNF is going to start turning up on a lot of buy lists (it already is, of course), and I hope others will at least take advantage of this dip. GLTA."
"Q1 2021 Revenue USD 3.1 Bil, versus USD 2.8 Bil consensus.Q1 2021 Adj diluted EPS from continuing operation $1.56 versus $1.22 consensus."
Gotta love that report!!!
Earnings report tonight will bring renewed attention to this thinly traded gem.
"I believe there is some manipulation going on because FG is still selling at a large discount; it is possible that the discount could fall if SP of FNF falls, but it has been on an upward trajectory. I continue to accumulate.The merger payout is for $2.75b, that is the value of $12.50 per share X the amount of shares. It was decided that only 60% of that amount, or $1.65b was to be paid out at that value of $12.50 per share.The remainder 40% will be paid out as $FNF stock at a value of .2558:1By my figuring, that amounts to this...1000 shares600 shares paid cash at $12.50/share $7500400 shares coverted to FNF .2558 becomes 102 shares of FNF with a current value of $32/share or $8.18 per share of FG. $3272$7500+$3272=$10,772On the original 1000 shares that is an overall value return at $10.77/share"
wall street analysts predicted $1.3x eps -- FNF announces $2.01revenue beat was similarcomplete blowout of expectations - but yahoo mssg board was on it :)
"Stocks typically trend higher before earnings if there's good news coming. So, why is FNF steadily trending lower 14 days prior to their earnings release."
"Just loaded another 500 shares on the wagon, as close to a 100% guaranteed significant long term return that I've ever come across.... # FACT"
"This is a totally unnoticed gem of a stock. I bought at $32 and it's one of the easiest investments I have ever seen. No brainer 50% return, at least. But since it isn't under the radar, I am not sure the market will react in proportion to the upside earnings surprise. It also beat earnings handily last quarter (though not as much), and the market just yawned."
"No hype just printing money Earnings Call tomorrow at noon - It's nice to own a low volatility stock with low PE, earnings growth, increasing dividends, and a share buyback program -"
With such great earnings why would anyone be selling at this price . Was shocked to see the opening prices at well under a dollar . What is going on here? This should be a big winner in this type of market.
When are they going to do something to support the stock or are they just sitting on their behinds making big bucks and perks
"Thanks for the discount. Add todays decline to the dividend equals 5% annually until they raise their dividend, which will raise the stock price. I expect however that with 2nd quarter's earnings release, it will be hard for the shorts to keep this cash cow down. Keep trying though."
"FNF looking very good. Insiders buying at similar-to-now prices in December. Fed keeps rates low. Mortgage & Re-fi apps off the charts, meaning big business to this company. Earnings *should* be excellent. Strong buy & hold in a choppy market."
I assume the co. is finally coming in now and buying a few shares. i cannot see anyone but me buying this lemon at the current price and its recent market reactions
Is this the company that everyone from Robinhood is moving their money to?
