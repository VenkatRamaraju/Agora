down 15% from highs. bad guidance??
"I swear this is the least popular stock ever for a well run cash machine. Kill earnings estimate which kept revising up (better than previous Corona estimates), beat revenue, 6.4% revenue increase from q1 last year. Well at least we get 5.15% dividends. You'd need to go buy oil companies and deal with their negative oil prices for this kind of yield"
"Wow, why the dump end of day?"
March option s call may be. Expired today.
Finally.. People seem to have woken up..
FNF is down -4.92% to 38.10
I am a mortgage broker. I use FNF for most of my refinance escrow. Last quarter I closed 119 loans which is 4 times of my normal volume. The escrow officer was so busy. They cannot handle the volume. Go FNF

"Of all of the positions that I hold, this is the ONE that does not concern me in any way. Residential real estate remains robust, as does refinancing. With our fully integrated platforms and our ridiculously low PE, we will continue to benefit going forward."
"The ""ultimate"" pure housing play."
"Interesting how DocX, Lenders Processing Services, Fidelity National Field Services Robo Signing, FNIS, MERS, Simple File, and ICE....Fidelity National Financial was involved in direct ownership or a majority stock holder of companies centrally involved, but diversified enough in the last Real Estate and Banking collapse to bring in revenues with billions and pay little in fines across the US. Buy, Buy and Buy....they are gearing up again for the Real Estate Market to bust."
why does it just burrow further into the ground each day. This is not normal.

One of the best stocks at the moment.

"Stocks typically trend higher before earnings if there's good news coming. So, why is FNF steadily trending lower 14 days prior to their earnings release."
With such great earnings why would anyone be selling at this price . Was shocked to see the opening prices at well under a dollar . What is going on here? This should be a big winner in this type of market.
"Investors in FNF doesn't seem to understand the impact of an anticipated Fed rate hike on the business of FNF. There is a difference between short rates and long rates. The Fed indicates that it will raise the benchmark short rate. There is a purpose to this -- to reduce inflation expectations. This reduction REDUCES the long rates. That is why 10-year treasury rate is falling today. Most mortgages are based on fixed long rates. This is good for both the new mortgages and refinancing. Moreover, new mortgages will switch even more from adjustable (short) rates to fixed (long) rates. To be sure, falling long rates is not favorable to FNF's annuity business. But the overall effect should remain positive. There is no rational reason why FNF should fall from $47+ to $44+."
Whatsup
Morgan Stanley just bought E*TRADE! So if GS buys FNF we can go North in a Zap! Hold on Long’s!!!!

"The drop on Friday's close was due to a big sell imbalance - it was options expiration day. Usually after such a move only caused by the imbalance, the stock returns back up."
"Q1 2021 Revenue USD 3.1 Bil, versus USD 2.8 Bil consensus.Q1 2021 Adj diluted EPS from continuing operation $1.56 versus $1.22 consensus."
Buybacks can start today. They indicated they may deploy more buyback capital earlier on in the next 12 month period due to the extreme undervaluation vs later. They could buy back bout 5% of company if deployed today.
"Next Tuesday, all current and recent sellers are going to feel pretty ignorant."
"Probably the best quarterly report in the history of the company! Company is a money printing machine. And, we are down......... I don't get it."
"This is a totally unnoticed gem of a stock. I bought at $32 and it's one of the easiest investments I have ever seen. No brainer 50% return, at least. But since it isn't under the radar, I am not sure the market will react in proportion to the upside earnings surprise. It also beat earnings handily last quarter (though not as much), and the market just yawned."

"Noticed on my brokerage statements that in July 2020, the name changed from ""Fidelity National Financial"" to ""FNFV Group"". However, ticker FNF still shows the old name. Can't find any press release about it. Did the name change on your brokerage statements, too? Why?"

down 50 cents each day. this so-called acquisition insurance for earnings is not shareholder friendly. bad choice. Wish I had got into FIS instead.
Very interesting value play here. I’m having a hard time getting to more than 7/8/9 forward PE for next year.
"Thanks for the discount. Add todays decline to the dividend equals 5% annually until they raise their dividend, which will raise the stock price. I expect however that with 2nd quarter's earnings release, it will be hard for the shorts to keep this cash cow down. Keep trying though."
Love how this SCAM tanked after the shares converted from FG.Ton of insider DUMPS last month from both companies.No wonder why the ambulance chasers were circling.
"Is anyone else having trouble transferring their brokerage account to Fidelity? Fidelity's transfer progress monitor shows an estimated completion date of 2/18/21, but the transfer is still hanging, indicating that the old brokerage hasn't yet reviewed or processed the transfer request. But when I spoke with the old brokerage, they said they approved the transfer.What is going on with Fidelity???"
Earnings report tonight will bring renewed attention to this thinly traded gem.

"The safety and intrinsic value of This Company is exceptional. Altough I can only afford a few shares, im proud to say that im an official stakeholder in This Company and I am very positive about the Outlook of this Company"
"FAF earnings announcement today with revenue growing 15% yoy but earnings slightly dropped. FAF share price dropped 10% so far, and FNF is being affected, dropping 3%. FAF actually has very good growth and improving margin in its core title business, and the disappointing result can be entirely explained by a $73Mil asset impairment in its non-core property and casualty business segment, which FAF now decides to sell.I don't think the market is acting rationally because FNF doesn't even have a property and casualty business."

FNF has been a core holding in my portfolio for years and I am happy with Bill Foley and the rest of his management team as they continue to be focused on building shareholder value. I do have difficulty following this stock as public information seems to be at a minimum. Does anyone have any updated information on the announced sale of Black Rock Financial and the rollover to tax free FNF shares to current holders?

Gotta love that report!!!
What is going on today (2.25)%?
"Going to blow way past analysts expectations again......... without any doubt and will again next qtr....... what's holding the price back from a $20 pick up is the perceived housing collapse, but that just is not going to happen anytime in the near future, People working from home even without a salary increase from pre pandemic have an additional 20% in their pockets just from less expenses overall from working from home......... as long as there is a housing market FNF will fly....... and it's still below Pre pandemic highs which is ridiculous.... I bot big in March 20 and then again June...... even picked up more last qtr....... dividend up to 36C love my FNF... the gift that keeps on giving baby!"

great earnings

How in the world is this stock selling off.. Its really hard to find a company this good.
With undocumented immigrants becoming citizens in 8 years looking to buy their 1st home. This stock will explode.
$90 million free cash flow. I will take that math any day!
"Cash cow!! Per earnings report, ""For the month of January, total orders opened were over 8,800 per day, with a steady increase each week and nearly 10,500 orders opened per day in the first week of February."" Now keep in mind that March daily orders likely jumped to over 12,000/day, and I am being conservative. Share price is down over 30% from 52 week high, yet, 2020 profit will be well above 2019. This stock is so undervalued today!! Buy, buy and buy more!! I bet we are above $40/share by May and approaching $50/share by July, and this will still be undervalued with a P/E of 10!!"
I gess I need to keep Buying

So frustrating the stock keeps falling. Wife works for FNF and has opened 6 weeks worth of business (refinances) in the last 10 days. Somebody in the company needs to talk up the business

"Well, I thought it would end up 3% up instead of this witchery. However, at some point (especially when valuations of many companies are up in the ozone) people are going to want to invest in companies who actually make money and aren't overpriced. FNF is going to start turning up on a lot of buy lists (it already is, of course), and I hope others will at least take advantage of this dip. GLTA."

This looks like a little gem...Too bad only 2 analysts follow the company...
When are they going to do something to support the stock or are they just sitting on their behinds making big bucks and perks
"No hype just printing money Earnings Call tomorrow at noon - It's nice to own a low volatility stock with low PE, earnings growth, increasing dividends, and a share buyback program -"
"FNF looking very good. Insiders buying at similar-to-now prices in December. Fed keeps rates low. Mortgage & Re-fi apps off the charts, meaning big business to this company. Earnings *should* be excellent. Strong buy & hold in a choppy market."

Three years ago it earned 2.26 a share and had a 16pe and traded in the 40's . Today it earns over 5dollars a share and still trades in the 40's IT's PE is 7 almost 50percent less than the average PE for its peer group. Despite a great housing and stock market it has gone nowhere. Why is it so cheap because management is doing a poor job for its stock holders. I just hope a bigger FIN institution would take it over.\
I will buy at under $20.
FNF is down 9.57% to 30.89
"I don't look at this as being a ""financial"" stock. To me, it is play on the vibrant housing market. New construction? They are involved. Existing housing? They are involved. Refinance? They are involved. Their business is involved in any Real Estate transaction that needs to be recorded at the court house.Money printing machine!!!"
"I believe there is some manipulation going on because FG is still selling at a large discount; it is possible that the discount could fall if SP of FNF falls, but it has been on an upward trajectory. I continue to accumulate.The merger payout is for $2.75b, that is the value of $12.50 per share X the amount of shares. It was decided that only 60% of that amount, or $1.65b was to be paid out at that value of $12.50 per share.The remainder 40% will be paid out as $FNF stock at a value of .2558:1By my figuring, that amounts to this...1000 shares600 shares paid cash at $12.50/share $7500400 shares coverted to FNF .2558 becomes 102 shares of FNF with a current value of $32/share or $8.18 per share of FG. $3272$7500+$3272=$10,772On the original 1000 shares that is an overall value return at $10.77/share"
