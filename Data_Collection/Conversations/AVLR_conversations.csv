"I like how the market is digesting Q4 earnings. PPS is holding up well, validating the 25% price increase that already occurred since Jan 1st 2020. Dips like today quickly snap back. I hesitate to make predictions, but i'd say we see $100-$110 before the next quarterly report, broader market willing."
"JAKARTA, July 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia imposed a 10% value-added tax on sales by technology firms including Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and Google on Tuesday, as spending patterns shift with increased remote working as a result of the coronavirus crisis, which has hit state finances."
BOFA'S analyst Brad Sills top pick TGT 200.
wheres the volume?
Anyone see Florida Gov DeSantis sign new tax law requiring companies to collect online sales tax for Floridians? thats instant demand for Avalara... more and more states likely to follow suit. the case for this company continues to get better.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

It's almost a given that sales tax is going to become one of the main taxes moving forward and continue to be complex and a headache for compliance which is why AVLR will become a powerhouse company and probably end up providing even more services to engage and help businesses large and small. This will be a homerun stock over the long term
@Raggweed I was right about the stock increasing $5 based on the chart. Only time will tell if another $20 up is in the cards. I believe a second wind is in the cards.
Who all bought more on this dip?
AVLR going back to 170 by end of month. Great company with exponential growth
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/avlr/after-hoursIs this real 100K @$70
"And 80 it is today. I decided to take the quick almost $10 per-share profit from these last few days. (Of course, I normally sell way too early, so this probably means this will got to $150 by next month, lol.) But with the uncertainty in the market these days, and the wild swings this stock takes, I will await (with my gains) for the next buying (and selling) opportunity."
"Good price action. When the stock price opens lower, the tuts start buying and support it. A little resistance in the $163+ range but I think we break through and move up into earnings. I’ve been reducing my positions in a lot of other names as they have continued to climb. AVLR is the only one I added to in the $120’s. GLTAL."
"@chuass, I had to do it. There has been extreme support in the mid $130 range so I added another 300 shares for a total of 500. $135.95 average price. I think this goes back to $190 this year."
It is a good company. But bit high. Will wait for it in the 28-33 range.
New highs tomorrow!
The MKT is being sold off. The administration wants higher Corp taxes and inflation is creeping in. Much fear.
my neighbour work for avalara he says buy the stock and hold long there and that's exactly what I'm doing 5 years plus
"Question: please explain how paying over 300 million cash for a company with annual revenue of 20 million makes sense. I understand they will be able to add on more services, but the price seems very steep. What am I missing on this?"
"So let me get this straight...e-commerce is up and up big. It's projected to continue to soar into 2021 and beyond. Avalara provides a necessary component to e-commerce business, one that e-commerce businesses don't want to dedicate capital on, one that will continue to increase in need and complexity, domestically and abroad. One whose revenues are linked directly to the revenues of their clients. Avalara is the market leader, both in scale and technology, with minimal competition. IMO, this company is the silent partner to the companies that will continue to thrive pandemic or not. Therefore, if A = B, and A goes up, then B goes up too."
"I decided to sell and take my $2,800 profit in case stock goes down after earnings."
Bammmmmm! And just like that we are at new highs.
strong results! very good!
I've never witnessed a platform like this. I'm glad and grateful to a friend who introduced me to Mrs Trisha. It was a positive trade.Facebook Trisha Donald
I cant believe how dead this conversation board is with all the money that has been made in the last 6 months. Excellent earnings report yesterday and still no coverage on CNBC. The ticker barely even goes by on screen. I guess this is a hidden gem. Just glad I made a boatload already. GLTA.
"Just my opinion, but I think an acquisition is in the works. I am a buyer on any dips, otherwise, I’m holding long and strong."
"I wish a real analyst would explain what is happening behind the scenes with this stock. There seems to be strong support usually but then we get big downswings once in a while. I know it is selling but, who, is it options related, is it more manipulation than fundamentals? We get good run ups and then it looks like the buyers disappear for a day."
The fundamentals on this business are incredible. The cost of sales tax non-compliance is enormous and states need tax revenue. Didn’t hurt that the IPO coincided with the decision by SCOTUS in favor of South Dakota in their case against Wayfair.
"@Lu We know now why the debt raise. They are on an acquisition spree to cobble together the leading suite of tax products for business. When the big money wants to run this thing, it is going to skyrocket."
What happened?
"Guidance is solid. AH's seems to not like it however. But, PYPL and SQ skyrocketed today after worse numbers comparatively in my opinion. Let's see what happens tomorrow during regular hours."
"If this thing ever climbs into the close instead of fading like almost always, then there would have to be something big brewing."
anyone have thoughts on the debt raise and why that is causing selling pressure?
I read a ton of reviews on Avalara.. only legit downside appears to be customer service because of how swamped they are. my two thoughts are either 1- is because lots of new business. 2- software setup is to complicated. im hoping it's 1...taxjar appears to be top competitor. anyone have insight?
"AVLR always seems to fade at the close. I wish the buyers weren't all heading to Luby's for the blue plate special for ""supper."" Stick around and keep buying and go to Peter Luger's for a real dinner."
Earnings in little over a month. I think we get a glimpse of an upswing in earnings. AVLR's innovation is ramping up and #$%$ taxation is becoming the most important tax available to raise revenues for governments.
Wouldn't AVLR be a great bolt-on suite of products for a company that deals with back office financial services? Or how about a #$%$ with proprietary software such as Square?
quiet in here for 3 weeks!
"Could not resist 2 more buy orders, had to sell another holding to increase the position. Will trade between the high 70’s to low 80’s prior to earnings or shortly after. over $100 b4 year end. Not a typical cloud play, India business willramp as well as Brazil. This company is doing everything right expanding into the worlds biggest economies. India in play from May and the infrastructure is in place.watch for announcements there-the will be the worlds largest economy in 3 years. Brazil is going top 5. You are looking at a stock that will be worth over $500 one day in the not too distant future, but only the early birds get the worm on the best kept secrets. No volume here on the down days so watch for 80 plus b4 earnings."
it's 185-205. buy before its too late
