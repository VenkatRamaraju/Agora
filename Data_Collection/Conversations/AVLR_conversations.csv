"Guidance is solid. AH's seems to not like it however. But, PYPL and SQ skyrocketed today after worse numbers comparatively in my opinion. Let's see what happens tomorrow during regular hours."
quiet in here for 3 weeks!
Great buy at $32 yesterday
"Hmmm, computer trading just to manipulate the market is strange. 1 share traded at $141.08 around 5:30pm so afterhours appears to be down almost $10. But, the NASDAQ web site doesn't seem to care because it still shows it unch in afterhours which is more accurate."
This is a great long term hold. I work in IT consulting and every retail client I’ve been on has gotten rid of their legacy tax software and implemented avalara
@Raggweed I was right about the stock increasing $5 based on the chart. Only time will tell if another $20 up is in the cards. I believe a second wind is in the cards.
"Announcing earnings on November 5th is a huge positive and indicates how well the company is run, as many have lengthy delays to tally results. Being in the business they are in and so efficient gains so much credibility with their clients. We popped huge in August and will be rewarded handsomely and they want to get the good news out there. We may even crack $100 before year end and q4 will be huge with transactions and revenues.I believe we will have some major announcements of new customers coming up as well. I wish I had some more dry powder, but am very happy with the position I’ve built. Should start to run anytime into earnings.We went from $77 to 0ver $90 in 3 trading days heading into results. I think we do better and hit a new 52 week high in November and then get a number of price target increases from all 8 top analysts including the best in the sector. $120 in December? Small percentage of the shares shorted, which is also a healthy sign that people respect the growth story and see this as a long term high growth stock for years to come that continues to add more vertices, while expanding wallet share with existing customers."
Did this company once offer OTC or it offer IPO right away?
yeah I saw that too 11 percent drop in the after hours but didn't last long
Bought this A.M. ON THE DIP 71.80
"Vote please by thumb up or down: Was a buy of 500 share today at $82 a good buy or not? Time Frame: Opening bell on Thursday, Aug 8th. That is the day after earnings."
This stock is beginning to wear on me. My profits are slowly dripping away ever since they announce the new share offering.
it's 185-205. buy before its too late
The fundamentals on this business are incredible. The cost of sales tax non-compliance is enormous and states need tax revenue. Didn’t hurt that the IPO coincided with the decision by SCOTUS in favor of South Dakota in their case against Wayfair.
Do you remember in the past this thing would have $10 & $15 spikes to the upside. They diluted some since then but I get a sense we are going to see another spike up around earnings.

Told everyone to buy yesterday.
Wouldn't AVLR be a great bolt-on suite of products for a company that deals with back office financial services? Or how about a #$%$ with proprietary software such as Square?
"JAKARTA, July 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia imposed a 10% value-added tax on sales by technology firms including Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and Google on Tuesday, as spending patterns shift with increased remote working as a result of the coronavirus crisis, which has hit state finances."
Oversold. Avalara is the top choice in taxSoftware and it has the highest growth rate as well
buy the dip pre earnings?
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4185798-avalara-misguided-hype
"AH selling is now typical, even for good earnings. The next couple of days will more telling. The real news from this release is EPS turning positive. This is huge and it will move the SP IMO. Also, a secondary offering isn't always negative. They're not doing it to keep the lights on, as they say. Increasing outstanding shares to raise capital for future development and/or to attract institutional investors are but a couple of good reasons to do so. ""Growth"" stocks frequently do this to facilitate their growth. This company is the proverbial 800lb gorilla in the industry...and it's still growing. Up or down near term, long term this stock is a winner! Cheers"
"$AVLR announced products updated to help businesses with the compliance complexities of new value-added tax (VAT) rules for ecommerce in EU effective July 1, 2021 due to significant VAT legislative changes."
Impressive support after today's sell-off. Deep pockets are fighting.
80 here we come....
"Good price action. When the stock price opens lower, the tuts start buying and support it. A little resistance in the $163+ range but I think we break through and move up into earnings. I’ve been reducing my positions in a lot of other names as they have continued to climb. AVLR is the only one I added to in the $120’s. GLTAL."
The MKT is being sold off. The administration wants higher Corp taxes and inflation is creeping in. Much fear.
Who would be selling stock in the 160 +- range. Have to be a long term holder. I don't understand this dip.
They announced CRUSH this morning but curiously did not include a date in the release. I'm not the target audience for this event but maybe only those that need to know are told the date? I don't need to know as a stockholder.
"We are setting at a 30% correction from the high. Buy, buy, buy!"
"Could not resist 2 more buy orders, had to sell another holding to increase the position. Will trade between the high 70’s to low 80’s prior to earnings or shortly after. over $100 b4 year end. Not a typical cloud play, India business willramp as well as Brazil. This company is doing everything right expanding into the worlds biggest economies. India in play from May and the infrastructure is in place.watch for announcements there-the will be the worlds largest economy in 3 years. Brazil is going top 5. You are looking at a stock that will be worth over $500 one day in the not too distant future, but only the early birds get the worm on the best kept secrets. No volume here on the down days so watch for 80 plus b4 earnings."
Who thinks AVLR is in its early years of growth? This drop in share price in tandem with other big tech is a buying opportunity IMHO.
Bammmmmm! And just like that we are at new highs.
It is a good company. But bit high. Will wait for it in the 28-33 range.
"IMO, I think AVLR will continue to steadily grow but we won't get a major breakout until companies start getting audited for sales tax where quill no longer can protect them. Most states audit for 3 years so that would be june 2021-June 2022 when audit letters could start going out. My guess is this is when the breakout will start occurring. Why? Because news media will start running articles about how xyz internet business wasn't collecting the tax and then got hit with some huge assessment that they can't fight because quill is dead. Businesses will realize that they MUST get a sales tax automation solution otherwise they will get left holding the bag for the sales tax liability. End result is rapid increase in revenue and stock price will follow.Needless to say, I am extremely bullish on this stock over next 5 years. Keep continuing to add to your positions because I am sure we will look back and say ""I remember when AVLR was only $35-$40/share"".Most of the critics I see for this stock have a way too sort-term focus viewpoint and lack the long-term view necessary for this stock."
"looks like this is going to go down somewhere in the 30's and stay there unless we get another news story about sales tax. the company is in the right industry at the right time, but unfortunately headquartered in Seattle where no one knows how to do actual business."
AVLR going back to 170 by end of month. Great company with exponential growth
"Bullish reversal today. If we close up, bodes well going forward."
About time-200 coming
Who all bought more on this dip?
wheres the volume?
"I reiterate, AVLR is the best kept e-commerce secret in the market. Q4 earnings will be quite impressive."
Anyone see Florida Gov DeSantis sign new tax law requiring companies to collect online sales tax for Floridians? thats instant demand for Avalara... more and more states likely to follow suit. the case for this company continues to get better.
"Financial news people need to actually read earnings reports. ASC 606 non-GAAP loss was -0.3 cents, beating expectations. Not the -.10 cent loss they are reporting. Smh. Beat on top and bottom line. Nice guidance too. I’d be a buyer on weakness but technicals are set up for a further rally. We’ll see."
Decided to start a long position here on today's weakness. Plan to hold through 2020 and 2021. Will be an interesting play.
"I wish a real analyst would explain what is happening behind the scenes with this stock. There seems to be strong support usually but then we get big downswings once in a while. I know it is selling but, who, is it options related, is it more manipulation than fundamentals? We get good run ups and then it looks like the buyers disappear for a day."
"AVLR always seems to fade at the close. I wish the buyers weren't all heading to Luby's for the blue plate special for ""supper."" Stick around and keep buying and go to Peter Luger's for a real dinner."
"AVLR has bounced off of $133 on 6/30 and 7/6. We're approaching it again. That is an important near term support level. If we bounce again, I think we move back to new highs rather quickly. If we break it, time to take profit."
I like this entry point!
"I decided to sell and take my $2,800 profit in case stock goes down after earnings."
"The recent drop was painful, but it allowed me to add to my position."
"$20 range next week. Don't bother buying in the $30 range, it will dip lower."
"Avalara is a hidden gem. E-commerce is only growing bigger and bigger throughout the world. COVID just expanded ""work from home"" and ""virtual living"" for many who never contemplated do it. Avalara is the silent partner to the e-commerce leaders who will continue to benefit from these continuing paradigm shifts. As e-commerce benefits, Avalara benefits; as Avalara benefits, AVLR shareholders benefit."
my neighbour work for avalara he says buy the stock and hold long there and that's exactly what I'm doing 5 years plus
where is this?
"The most important thing in my mind is the fact that on this trajectory, I believe AVLR will become profitable in the next quarter. That's a big deal at such an early point in its development."
I was wrong. AVLR is going to be the consolidator in the industry it appears. Great acquisition and a bunch of high-value corporate customers.
I read a ton of reviews on Avalara.. only legit downside appears to be customer service because of how swamped they are. my two thoughts are either 1- is because lots of new business. 2- software setup is to complicated. im hoping it's 1...taxjar appears to be top competitor. anyone have insight?
The market gobbled up those shares and is moving back up. Some rich people wanted in at lower levels so they can ride this to new highs. The longs will be rewarded well.
New highs tomorrow!
AVLR - great way to hook onto the SHOP train!
"low 39s will be a great entery point. it will get there in few trading sessions. lol The company did not accomplish much financially for 14 years.However it developed a platform, which will start benefiting right now. Digital ecosystems, is an evolutionary and it is time to capitalize. CEO was very optimistic on the conference call. I am curious what analysts will write tomorrow."
"oversubscribed, good sign for gains"
I cant believe how dead this conversation board is with all the money that has been made in the last 6 months. Excellent earnings report yesterday and still no coverage on CNBC. The ticker barely even goes by on screen. I guess this is a hidden gem. Just glad I made a boatload already. GLTA.

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now.

AVLR trying to climb through resistance  cmonnn you can do it
Been in since 150-It sure can have violent swings-FEB earnings should settle down and move forward.
Why is AVLR down to 156 from almost 175?

AVLR is a pure-play SaaS model...recurring revenue and a captive market with incredible upside. Definitely going long on this one. They are decreasing marketing spend now that they are known as THE go to solution. They have more integrations than anyone else with ERP and accounting software solutions. The subscriptions will continue to grow and expand and the recurring revenue model will reward all!
"Wow amazing finish. Low float , it is going to be volatile. Lot can be gained and lost. If you can stomach it. Will keep an eye and take a position. Mid to low 30s if it gets there."
Earnings in little over a month. I think we get a glimpse of an upswing in earnings. AVLR's innovation is ramping up and #$%$ taxation is becoming the most important tax available to raise revenues for governments.
Shopify and Amazon overachieved the sales. I guess that it means the same for all internet sales. And it should lead to more internet taxes paid. And that is where Avalara jumps in!
"Ahh should've doubled down when it was -13%, earnings were really not that bad"
Taking a good ol' pounding today. I will continue to hold. Taxes are only going to go up and they might get creative. AVLR will be business for years to come.
Bought another 700 shares today at 33 and will enjoy the bounce back into the 40s. It seems that this company will grow its revenues very nicely
anyone have thoughts on the debt raise and why that is causing selling pressure?
Anyone buying on the dips?
Blowout earnings.
strong results! very good!
"Good news. The more we climb, the less trolls there are on the AVLR board."
nice ride
"So let me get this straight...e-commerce is up and up big. It's projected to continue to soar into 2021 and beyond. Avalara provides a necessary component to e-commerce business, one that e-commerce businesses don't want to dedicate capital on, one that will continue to increase in need and complexity, domestically and abroad. One whose revenues are linked directly to the revenues of their clients. Avalara is the market leader, both in scale and technology, with minimal competition. IMO, this company is the silent partner to the companies that will continue to thrive pandemic or not. Therefore, if A = B, and A goes up, then B goes up too."
See it went up
"Earnings look pretty good. But, you can't tell what the big money wants to do. Force it down or prop it up. GLTAL!"
BOFA'S analyst Brad Sills top pick TGT 200.
"And 80 it is today. I decided to take the quick almost $10 per-share profit from these last few days. (Of course, I normally sell way too early, so this probably means this will got to $150 by next month, lol.) But with the uncertainty in the market these days, and the wild swings this stock takes, I will await (with my gains) for the next buying (and selling) opportunity."
EPS is negative because avlr is in growth mode. Amazon wasn’t profitable until a couple of yrs ago
I see more downside
"If this thing ever climbs into the close instead of fading like almost always, then there would have to be something big brewing."
"Please excuse me for this question, but WHY are they not profitable? I probably need to look deeper in the financials, but if someone has an answer, I'd appreciate it."
"I sense it will be a great stock, in high flying velocity because of its technologyCLOUD."
Next earnings report will show a profit in my opinion.
What happened?
I see the target has been updated on yahoo finance from previous 190 slow and steady growth ahead all we have to do its wait and add more on dips if anymore weakness present itself ahead
Does anyone get a sense that the smart money keeps pouring into AVLR? Can you see AMZN or facebook buying this to bolt onto their small business suite of services?

Gotta love sticky revenue in a growing market
It's almost a given that sales tax is going to become one of the main taxes moving forward and continue to be complex and a headache for compliance which is why AVLR will become a powerhouse company and probably end up providing even more services to engage and help businesses large and small. This will be a homerun stock over the long term
"I like how the market is digesting Q4 earnings. PPS is holding up well, validating the 25% price increase that already occurred since Jan 1st 2020. Dips like today quickly snap back. I hesitate to make predictions, but i'd say we see $100-$110 before the next quarterly report, broader market willing."
"Question: please explain how paying over 300 million cash for a company with annual revenue of 20 million makes sense. I understand they will be able to add on more services, but the price seems very steep. What am I missing on this?"
"I work in the sales tax industry as a professional and I have friend who work as auditors for state governments. To say the least, AVLR is a huge huge buy right now. You can't use traditional metrics to evaluate this stock right now so of course the enterprise value seems out of sync but the growth here is going to be significant in the next 2-5 years. Right now states are figuring out what they are going to do in terms sales tax requirements but eventually it will be determined. From my friends who work for the gov, basically on the grapevine the states want more businesses collecting and remitting sales tax and companies won't be able to hide behind quill anymore. Once everything gets worked out there is going to be a mad dash to implement sales tax software systems and then eventually audits are going to start getting sent out to pull in all the companies who fail to register. That will encourage all of the standouts to get software as well. Complying with 50 states worth of sales tax requirements is not something a small sales tax department can handle. You need software to do it.Needless to say, this company right now is a huge buy. I could also see it being a takeover target by maybe intuit or some other business software company."

"@chuass, I had to pull the trigger at $135.50. Only 200 shares but I'll average down if we keep going down next week."
Tax compliance automation is huge especially in an environment of social distancing coupled with changing government tax guidelines. I am a believer in this company.

Looking forward to the earnings call. AVLR will be a great long term investment in my view. They should be able to win big clients moving forward with their superior services.
"Just my opinion, but I think an acquisition is in the works. I am a buyer on any dips, otherwise, I’m holding long and strong."
Bought 41.90
Keeping an eye on this to see if I can get a little better entry point. Probably have to chase which I hope I won’t.
Scotus tax - collect from small business-AVLR has software.
Bought a small amount back 131.20- Could jump next earnings.It has been a hard one to figure out.
I might just get the pleasure of adding to my AVLR position if we keep going down this week. And fun times were had by all.
Great stock if you want to lose money
Holding 50s well.
What a gift. just lucky didn't by IPO Bought today 41.90I know what they do but this is crazy volume strong
Disappointing reception to earnings but I believe they are giving us another chance to add shares cheaper. Does anyone have a doubt that the stock price won’t be higher in 4Q2020 than it is today?
There seems to be a big support at $50

"Question: Is Avalara (AVLR) a Smart Long-term Buy? - Alex Smith, Insider MonkeyAnswer: yes. - third_deviation, Yahoo Message Board Contributor"
"Anyone that visits this board, you should know that there are 3-5 years of solid growth in AVLR. That's if they aren't bought before that. I predict that is a guarantee."
Looks like momentum is over
"I am buying tommorrow, get in before it gets too high"
I had predicted a profit in the last quarter. It didn't happen. Sounds like it won't happen this quarter either. But could there be a surprise to the upside? Maybe it's executive comp that will drive it into a loss for the quarter?
what is going on after hours?!
Not much volume-Smart money reading future for AVLR.
"@chuass, I had to do it. There has been extreme support in the mid $130 range so I added another 300 shares for a total of 500. $135.95 average price. I think this goes back to $190 this year."
Bought on the big drop 150
New partner additions is good news. It continually enhances the value of AVLR. I wonder if this will get us back to new highs over the next several months?
Good time to buy.
