MSON is down 10.36% to $15.05
Looks like a little consolidation has occurred and now were on our way to a new 52 week high. At $8.45 no-one in the past 5 years ever lost money holding $EDAP. Maybe soon it will be ever. In 2006 EDAP was trading around 18 bucks. I think that is possible and probably much higher if HIFU companies gather Wall Street Attention and run together as a group. $MSON Misonix is having a pretty good week too.

"not such a bad buyout price at 6x nxt yr sales. Could have been higher tho? Stravos has proved to be a good steward of mson, how the biz performs will depend on how long he hangs around in bvs? BVS was similar to Anika, no longer so much..."
"I might become a BUYER, when it hits $10.00 per share. (internals of the company are disorganized)"
