"CEO suddenly went with no plan, new CFO parachuted in to clean up. Both old ""execs"" there for decades feeding from the trough. Not good signs. Strange how all this happens when the ""free"" money from the patent license are about to run out...."

"check out Innovative Foods, IVFH, they are doing about $0.20 EPS and trading for less than $0.70 per share, and getting more liquid. Top line grew and bottom line doubled YOY. They suck at IR but now they are going to start focusing more on getting the story out."

"Yahoo Finance is putting a price target of $26 on this stock.......I wonder what they are smoking.....They are about as accurate in their financial prognostications as they are about their ""news""...."
"I sold out on 3/13 after many, many years. Maybe 20+ years. Made money but it was time to let it go.Might consider getting back in if it falls to $5-6 which it seems to do fairly regularly.I got $11.50."
Nice turnaround! $16 today.

Just Wait Until BVS sees the mess that misonix has sold them. *It ain't no software problem/issue....it's Hardware.!!!!! ((They need to look into misonix better - start at the foot!))
The most important issue was not asked on the call: what happens when the royalty stream ends? It's 1 m a quarter straight to the bottom line... Of course much of it is going to the lawyers right now...

Poor Workers That work at this company. No long term rewards in stock prices.... just collecting a paycheck. Sad.

Looks like a little consolidation has occurred and now were on our way to a new 52 week high. At $8.45 no-one in the past 5 years ever lost money holding $EDAP. Maybe soon it will be ever. In 2006 EDAP was trading around 18 bucks. I think that is possible and probably much higher if HIFU companies gather Wall Street Attention and run together as a group. $MSON Misonix is having a pretty good week too.

just muddeling along.... nothing to see here... seems like a lack of interest results in a lower & lower drift in price.
Did you see the last Sec alert? Does the new CEO's agenda include acquiring MSON?

Not sure I like the action on the stock price. Hope this action is selling by the shorts. Happened last time and it went down to $3.80 something. Big changes from last conference call with no follow up information. Time for 4th quarter earnings numbers and some feed back on the big changes. What's going on!!!!
"I might become a BUYER, when it hits $10.00 per share. (internals of the company are disorganized)"
"not such a bad buyout price at 6x nxt yr sales. Could have been higher tho? Stravos has proved to be a good steward of mson, how the biz performs will depend on how long he hangs around in bvs? BVS was similar to Anika, no longer so much..."
