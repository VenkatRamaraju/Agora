Can’t say I don’t love the current AMC price action!
Buy and hold AMC
Almost a $7 increase in only two days we should be over $50 by Friday thumbs up if you feel the same way
AMC ABOUT TO LAUNCH ….$100 HERE WE COME
Good night Apes hold strong! Squeeze starts at 1k!! If i can hold you can hold I have a crazy amount of shares!
AMC IS AHEAD OF HOOD HAHAHAHA. PAY UP KENNY.
I added more AMC. I’m still holding.
Next stop  the 
Hood into the 30's by EOD...
This isn’t the HOOD forum anymore.This is the AMC forum now
If you were watching level 2 at the end there you could see the power of just a couple of minutes. Not that the hedges will even be around for too many more Fridays but this is a sign of your demise. You are no longer able to fight. Your bullets are like marsh mellows. lol.
ATTENTION HOOD-winked investors NOW is the time to jump on the AMC Rocket before LIFTOFF! It’s not too late.BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Trying to figure out if these Bashers give services other than just bad advice ie Kenny!
AMC up over 6% today!
"Bashers keep insisting that AMC is facing imminent bankruptcy and that is simply not true. The company is sitting on $2 billion in cash, the creditors are restructuring, and the blockbuster movies are starting to pop! Spider-Man, Top Gun, Bond, Eternals, Shang-chi & Ten Rings plus more! Cash is flowing and apes are keeping the stock price flying! AMC is back baby!"
serious question... what DD lead people to invest in HOOD?
Where is Kenny?!!!
just bought 7 more shares of AMC!
"Good morning, Apes, it’s a wrap-up of the latest news regarding the next bullish AMC movement: 1, GG indicated on Barron’s that SEC is taking actions against PFOF, which will definitely eliminate the SHFs privileges somehow. 2, On Aug 30,, Vanguard disclosed about 42M shares ownership of AMC on its various indexes at the end of June 30, 2021. 3, Volumes traded in dark pools was about 67.5% of the total volumes, the highest number since Aug 9 while the price was still moving up. 4, No one knows how high the height or how many synthetics shares are out there, there’ll be many halts during the squeeze and FUD as well. The only selling signal is “whether shorts have covered?” Otherwise, Apes BUY & HODL!"
Update: hood new target 0.15
I bought AMC 2x today. Who else?
Yahoo. Why do you have the latest stock information on AMC showing two months ago whereas you have Hood reaction showing two hours ago. Where is your professionalism abd your Fiduciary responsibilities as a financial stock market serving clients? The information you show is totally outdated and unreliable on AMC. Step up to the plate and demonstrate some form of non biasness and professionalism.
Harris here from the new and improves amc board. Things are looking good. Feckless gensler finally in a box to get rid of hood and citadel payment for order flow. Squeeze is on baby !!!
They need to ensure they get the 14 billion Kenny brought overseas when he goes to prison!
Go AMC
"The shorts underestimated our resolve as well as the sheer strength of our community. They tried to short all these companies to death and low and behold, these companies are now breathing fire. They just don't understand that with 5 or 6 million investors in AMC, the product is also being heavily supported by those investors by visiting the movies and purchasing other product offers. This isn't your grandfathers AMC, this is the new AMC. They doubted us #$%$10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45 etc...Their arrogance is misplaced to say the least and everyone is turning on Citadel who once ruled the roost but no longer. Margin calls are right around the corner and total chaos is going to create a buying frenzy never ever seen before. Why people doubt AMC with all the catalysts out there, I have no idea, but keep doubting us, because I think we have not even scratched the surface yet as far as how long we are willing to hold out for the mother of all short squeezes. They can no longer afford us. lol."
$52 tomorrow
Diamond hands since January
"Today, the only 2 (two) stock I have blasted out of Short PositionsAMC just starting and immpBullish on AMC"
"When the SEC bans payments for order flow, that'll cut 80%+ of RH's revenue. Good luck selling cartoons and spinning emojis."
Govt going to shut down Hd you watch! Dont buy it! Buyer beware!
Let’s all report yahoo to the SEC for manipulating stock values by censoring freedom of speech
#AMC 2 D MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AMC spiking in AH!!! Love it!!!
"Funny how all these financial news people blabber on about why AMC is going up, but never address the elephant in the room “naked short selling” or “market manipulation”?"
Buy AMC !
AMC borrow fee rate is up!5.6% nowLet's green day today!
AMC is trying to break past 46 and quickly head to 47 and 48. APES just need to give it a nudge!
Can anyone buy HOOD in pre-trading??? I got the following error:Fatal error: type: MODULE name: __orders/equityOrder - r47eb2c2e7b-0a52-11ec-b2e8-005056b4bede-55
Close the doors Hood.
AMC breakout soon!
"Hello Kenny,,, I have a collect call from Marg DO YOU ACCEPT THE CHARGES???????"
Nobody is selling AMC in the $40s. Not Selling and Not going Anywhere!
Buying a few AMC shares every day. Holding almost 300. I love this stock.
amc boardnot signed in I could see recent posts.Signed in as an APE. posted about Holding 3600 Ape shares since January===deleted postand cannot see new posts====they fixed it according to your history it seems.
Baggies slayer is a paid shill 100 percent. Do not respond to “it” that’s how it makes a living. Do a separate comment responding and “it” does not get paid!!!! You still get to respond but not in a way that “it” gets paid.AMC to the moon and soon!!!
"SEC ""considering"" ban on PFOF."
"Whoah, #AMC is gonna blow soon! "
hahahhahahaha
"LMAO, Baggie saying AMC is crashing, I think your monitor is upside down. tool."
"PFOF Banning, this is going down"
Don't forget APES to also buy more on the way up.... That keeps this thing moving...
Closing at the day’s high is cool. 
"I think the AMC ROOM is fixed, bit I like this one better"
Baggie holder and his elite team will be opening up a wendies very soon to serve AMC apes our chicken tendies.
Apes lets push this thing over $48!! Amc to the moon!
hoodies. time to jump ship. AMC is passing you .
YF showing HOOD as a trending ticker right now with it's 0.05% LOL what a joke!
Added 10 AMC shares this morning at Ask. Really need to get close to 50 before 2:30.
Testing
"not selling, buying more AMC tomorrow. this will hit 4 figures, then 5!"
"amc amc, hodling for you and me, lets go"
Robin Hood stole from the rich to give to the poor not the other way around. Good luck with Karma.
"If we hold through 45, next stop 48…amc!"
AMC RIPPIN’ !!!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
#$%$ AYYEEE TEAM. well done today..proud of every last one of you. keep it up.

"Gee, this stock thing is kinda fun when it’s AMC!"
Hedgy you owe a billion plus shares; AMC to the moon! By the way and interest!
"I jumped into AMC to make some quick money, but it’s been green everyday since, so I’m still holding"
FOMO is REAL…buy AMC before we ROCKET!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"I am having some second thoughts about investing in AMC my first thought was to buy and hold, my second thoughts are to buy some more"
Guys go to the 3 month chart is it me or does it look like amc is about to do a huge cup and handle and absolutely rip up I’m looking for 48$-52$ range then maybe a little drop then an explosion
APES OWN THE FLOAT AND MORE!! AMC TO THE MOON! CANT HAVE ENOUGH SHARES!
Baggie slinger trying to get his 9 hour shift in to make rent; not spending Hood investor millions with vlad.
I don't have a problem with payment for order flow as much as I have a problem with market makers being active market participants.
AMC that is all
"Here we are going into a other week. This is week 32 for me and just like all the others, I can't wait to get it started.According to some, we shouldn't even be here, AMC should already be bankrupt or the price should be single digits.Well surprise surprise surprise! Not only is AMC not bankrupt but we are sitting on a share price of 40 dollars and the AMC fundamentals are looking better every day with plenty of money in the bank for bills or even acquisitions.We are here for one reason, because we winning. Not only are we here but we have now been joined by big smart money. They are not here to help the hedge funds. They are here for the same reason we are, the squeeze.There are so many institutions that know what's up. Many of these institutions are even part either the short selling mafia or are institutions that have been capitalizing on their cozy relationships and steady growth for decades.That's ok though because are in this for a big win just like us."
I’m coming back for one last buy in the last ten minutes today. : )
You just got to love this flawlessly working AMC forum. And the ever growing red numbers on the top of the page are just the icing on the cake.
It seems the yahoo board is showing recent posts again but probably just temporarily post on $HOOD as well just to be sure. Big money institutions and HF's are taking long positions on AMC and retail still owns the majority of the float. The squeeze can happen at any moment.
"Even if they fix the AMC chat board, I think we should still stay here indefinitely. HOOD deserves consequences for their actions"
Let’s go bought puts EOD. going back to IPO prices at min. Rumors of banning PFOF. that’s literally saying there’s a chance pretty much their whole business is wiped out
AMC easy 48.00 today!
Good job $AMC! The squeeze is near! 
AMC is looking juiced up... Can't say the same for HOOD. Ha
HOOD $5 off IPO price. Soon to be $12 and delisted I suspect. BUY AMC and SQUUEEEEEZE the Shorties. snickering...
AMC Could easily be $50 by EOD or after hours today.... !!
Hedgie is not looking forward to today. Go AMC!
"A.M.C looks awesome, we rock it!"
"True story: I have a neighbor and we have been fighting about parking spots for 3 years. On and off, the other day, he mentioned $AMC, and from that minute on, the WAR was over. $AMC brings everyone together. It was instant respect for both of us."
"$AMC $HOOD.... AMC and HOOD are intersecting today, as I had predicted... AMC on the way up, and HOOD on the way down!! By tomorrow, permanent, never to meet again. As each continues on the same path, HOOD plummeting, and AMC skyrocketing!! Viva la AMC!!!"
To AMC holders - last chance to get in below $45.To HOOD holders - last chance to get out above $40.
AMC will close above $48.00 today!!
APES just buy and hold all day long... That is literally all it takes!
The entire system sees it coming and is preparing for it. Even Kenny has moved his personal stash to the Cayman Island. You're either going to profit from the squeeze or you'll be paying for it.
Buck the Fedgies! LET'S GO!
We need to talk about AMC Shorty…
Bashers; one question what happened to single digits? AMC!!
look at AMC...
Kenny Griffin said he didnt see the 2008 crash coming lol!! He was the major reason for it!
"Every AMC share counts! We buy em! Synthetic or not, we don't care "
AMC TO THE MOON!! CAN YOU FEEL IT!
"like a kettle in the kitchen I feel the steam begin to brew.even stocks can be affected, we're drivin it up their drivin it down Nothing matters but the week end from a Tuesday point of view"
"To be honest and fair without bashing anyone or any company, I think the best thing the sec can do to prevent amateurs and retail investors from losing money is to ban buying options. All problems solve as easy as that"
Shorts.....
"Citadel was counting on HOOD to be a cash cow and being able to short them to like they did with AMC for 8 months. With AMC, they withheld buy orders in mass and released them to drive the price up, take a short position and then release sell orders to drive it down. This is their scam and it has been very lucrative for them but only temporary. With HOOD, they thought they could do the same thing. Sadly though, there is no buying pressure so the only way they can drive the price up is to purchase actual stocks which is counterproductive."
HOOD IS
AMC looking so sexy PM ! Hood welcome to the thirty something !
look like HOOD and AMC swap place!
Baggies team --giving up on baggies advice..
"Article yesterday confirmed by AA, CEO of AMC that over 80% of the float shares ARE owned by individual investors. No one fund or institution has more than 10% so that makes it easier for the company to maneuver through tactical changes they need to make for the betterment of AMC. If we don't sell, no one can cover. All the shorting is illegally borrowed shares. Every few weeks or a month, when margin calls come due and shorts don't liquidate themselves and FTD, then custodians put in system buy orders that result in major run ups like Tuesday. All we have to do is hold through a few of these and have the stock settle and consolidate at higher lows each time. On Tues shorts lost 1B that's on top of Melvins already lost $6bn. All you have to do is HOLD"
……. (Continued) Based on 5 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for AMC Entertainment in the last 3 months. The average price target is $6.38 with a high forecast of $16.00 and a low forecast of $1.00. The average price target represents a -86.46% change from the last price of $47.13.
Some people enjoy losing money they buy hood instead of AMC
Hood
One day closer to The Squeeze! :)
"Nice, we passed 47 the resistance. Gravy from here on!Amc is the #hood"

Breaking news HOOD is getting shut down!
"Wouldn't this restriction affect more than just RH? I don't trade using RH, but it seems the restriction lays the groundwork for the return of ""9.95 per trade"" across all platforms."
AMC WE LIKE THE STOCK!
"Yeah, AMC passed HOOD. Next top AMC to the moon"

Same thing tomorrow shall we? ; )

Cup and Handle is formed on multiple charts.... AMC is ready to rip!!
Back to IPO pricing. 80% of revenue comes from PFOF
"Man, this gives Bulgaria a bad name......"
HOOD is a $2.50 stock.
"Jump to AMC, she is warming up."
Remember when some analyst said “ going to one cent “ that’s American by the way
Go $47!

the Bullish Report on Robinhood Markets Inc.https://chart-analysis.tools/HOOD
baggie slayer 5000 is trying to step up his game because he failed to deliever last friday he got cussed out and warned
"fidelity new share count available to short is 273,091 and still marked HTB hard to borrow with annual Est. int rate to borrow at 1%.. at least thats down from 1mm yesterday #amc moving day"
Either way a nice controlled squeeze for the strong Apes! AMC!
Stock Market looking pretty sick! Not AMC!
AMC is going to pluto soon. I know I have my stuff packed.
Holdin $AMC for a year and 2 months..I'm ready for MOASS this week! My CG taxes gonna be low especially in FL!

IF flows are banned. Robinhood stock is toast
Good morning! What a beautiful day!
100m in volume 
What did you say hood ? I can't t hear you from up here!
Confirmed controlled short squeeze in progress love it!! AMC to the moon!
LC going to double !!!
A M C
Just stopping by to say hello to my AMC family. Have a nice day !
Is Hood going out of business? I heard what the SEC is considering.
so any guesses when AMC passes hoodlum? I say today!
AMC. The one and only 
I see a cup and handle forming on the AMC 1 minute chart
This is why I don't post anything besides basher smashing comments. I just spent 5 minutes writing a comment about Gary Gensler saying that a ban on PFOF is a possibility and it's potential impact on $HOOD just to have it disappear. I must have used a yahoo no-no word.
"Baggie slayer and hedge funds, let today be a lesson for you. You are no longer in control. Closing over 47 was a message that your reign has ended. Whales set 47 as a number to reach today and despite everything, the hedge funds lost again."
attn hoodies: AMC IS THE WAY!
"SEC is right to look into dark pools, but banning payment for order flow is not happening. It would be equivalent to SEC asking the market maker to not make any money or in other words, not make the market.SEC has known about the dark pools for a long time, and they did nothing to stop the practice.If HOOD's business model is so bad, why is PayPal getting in to trading. Meme stocks, retail investors, and online trading is here to stay."
"NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR AMC SHORTS.ALSO, DVAX CONTINUES TO SMASH SHORTS, AND IS AT ANOTHER NEW HIGH "
rocket has begun launch sequence. AMC AMC AMC!
Love our new board… Welcome
"It doesn't make me smart to have accurately predicted that the AMC share price would surpass HOOD soon. Anybody could have done it. In after hours, there we have it, and the stocks will continue to move in opposite directions from here. I warned you HOOD holders about a week ago to dump your shares before you lost it all, because there is absolutely no good reason for the HOOD SP to go back up after its recent earnings report, as the hedgies were only going to prop it up for so long. Cut your losses with HOOD tomorrow and buy AMC. Trust me, I'm your best friend in the world right now."
AMC to the moon . Sell hood come join amc 100k train
"Robinhood warned investors in its initial public offering prospectus earlier this summer that any change to its ability to charge payment for order flow is a risk factor. Well, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission told Avi today that banning the practice altogether is “on the table.”"
"This stock is going to do great, AMC that is."
Pretty sad statement when only baggie and Cruz are the ones left from all the others…Not able to understand their fight is futile…
I am going to make a Basher my pet after the squeeze!
"Yahoo Finance, pls provide HOOD their own message board. Spamming this AMC board with stuff on the insignificant HOOD stock is not acceptable in the long run."
AMC not selling
SEC needs to give retail the ability to ladder attack and high frequency trade and front run our orders in front of hedge fund orders. Then its fair at least. Maybe give retail our own secret exchange hedge funds cant see or use. Dont worry it wont change the price!
Remember That Time When HOOD Stopped Trading Of AMC & GME Stock...https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321
$Hood will plummet 90%+ from current levels
APES OWN THE HOOD BOARD!!!
"SEC reportedly probing whether fraudulent social media posts boosted GameStop, AMC and others=The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether misinformation posted on social media was used to boost the stocks of GameStop and AMC, according to Bloomberg. The commission is also said to be reviewing trading data as part of its probe into potential market manipulation.This inquiry comes a week after shares in GameStop and AMC, among other companies, were sent soaring, largely thanks to support from Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community. The community is ostensibly composed of small-time, amateur traders, but there’s been speculation as to whether some of the members of the community — which describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal” — may in fact have been professional investors looking to capitalize on the forum’s fervor.The SEC has information that the Klan calling themselves the ""APES"" are behind these crimes. The investigation is ongoing."
"$AMC 10,000 dollar investment will return to you 1,000,000. #it'sawinwin"
Now we wait for 15 minutes for regular trading to close out completely and then we will see if tonight is the night for some fireworks. They cannot sustain these prices. Easy Math.
Buffet said be greedy when others are fearful. I keep averaging down.
Amc to the moon 
Baggie only basher accepted most minimum pay since they pay low now for bashing amc just to survive in mumbai
i’m on AMC close at $47 you can do it.
Who in their right mind would purchase Hood over AMC.... INSANE!!
Who sold at 41.50 ?Seriously?
"I know it's hard but forget the line, forget power hours, forget technical and fundamentals. There is nothing more we need to do or nothing more we can do. Just hold please!"
Hood not looking promising
"There are probably a few hedge funds sitting there right now with their finger on the buy button thinking they could close out their positions cheaper and still live to see another day. Either that or it may not matter to any hedge fund because after the last 7 or so days the share price is up like 12 dollars in that time span and that's a ton of money if you are short on hundreds of thousands, millions or even billions of shares."
PFOF is already banned in most major markets so this could be the situation that pushes US markets to follow suit. With how fragile US markets even the perception of bias or corruption could have devastating consequences.
Citadel didn’t see this coming just like 08 but this is worse. They won’t give up until they are bankrupt
40 is a million times more important than 8.01. Just saying.
I would like to concur with Alex’s comment. Those who think it’s possible to jump in as it begins to squeeze will be sadly mistaken. In the morning you will look and the premarket will be up $20-30+ dollars and then when the bell rings it’ll start gapping up in large chunks of maybe $100 increments. It will be impossible to jump in front with your limit order. (Unless you set for something hundreds or a thousand dollars above but wouldn’t that defeat the reason you’re here?) You will miss out. It’s like saying that you can get around to fastening your seatbelt when you see the accident happening! Be smart: buy now and hold now. When this pops you won’t get a second chance.
VANGUARD…. One of the most respected investment brokers in the world… now has almost 32 million shares of AMC … they know a squeeze is coming they are in it to win it let’s follow the whales people.
To my fellow APES who bought at $50 and $60 we are coming for you hodl on...!!!
"I can't, there are no shares to borrow for shorting.............Hmmm, better just go long and make some easy money!"
amc moving nicely today!
Let's push $AMC over $47 by close.
No fear; only fear not having enough shares!! AMC!
AMC will rule the world! Yeehaw!!!! 
Today's price and date prediction: could be green could be red and one day closer to going to the moon! HODLing xxxx shares since Jan. Haven't sold. Not #$%$ leaving! I'm ready. LFG!!
"Everytime I see ""shares available to borrow"". I'm like that's the Price I'm waiting For"
SEC INVESTIGATION - Are we good?
"I AM DONE WITH HOOD, sold all my shares today. What a chet’ show of a company. Putting all my money in AMC."
This upward pressure at these volume rates are exerting maximum pain on HFs. Nice.
"love how amc investors took over this board , this is the way"
#APESUNITED#WERENOTLEAVINGGO AMC…BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Hood $43.07 and AMC $43.59 interesting
"Hello, I just called to say Hello.......Goodbye HOOD...."
hedgies loosing control cant keep hoodlum above amc anymore. rocket is about to launch.
Ending PFOF=End of HOOD. Go AMC!!!
RH investors and execs now starting to realize the very companies that pay for their order flow like Citadel are manipulating the stock price down. Now they see what Citadel does to GME and AMC.
"In Honor of Baggie Slayer, I bought 20 more shares of AMC this morning.....I am gonna snicker all the way to the bank"
Any chance Hood would stop buying of Hood but allow only selling of Hood !
Go AMC!!!
No payment for order flow soon ha ha ha! SEC got this!
Everyone knows AMC is the best investment in the world!!
AMC STILL CLIMBING AFTER HOURS….TOMORROW WILL BE A HHUGE GAIN !!!!
Love the nice confirmed controlled squeeze AMC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AMC IS GOLD!!!
why is there People here commenting about HOOD??
baggie slayer aren't you tired
"As I said, for the movie stock, Wednesday to Friday will be very interesting"
Censor us shorty we already know the deal shorty! Squeeze starts at 1k!
HOOD Pre-Market 42.95 -0.69 -1.58% SNICKERING...#AMC to The MOON!!!
Cannot wait to buy more AMC at this huge discount.?
Added 500 more AMC shares  Long and strong till the end!
Made 20k!! Not selling one share! Squeeze starts at 1k!
"25 thousand people who were working for AMC would have been permanently out of a job if the hedge funds were successful in their foolish desire to bankrupt them. They would have kept all the money they collected for selling fake shares if the bankruptcy happened so they went all out. Do you think they would have even given the people who liked their job and out of work a second thought?They are in this for one reason and one reason only, to make money from all retail investors using their nefarious home-grown systems to bamboozle us. Of course, if you were in the good graces of the self proclaimed God, Kenny Griffen, you didn't have to worry.But if you didn't bow down and kiss his ring, he would steal that dollar from your pocket in a heartbeat and then take the shirt off your back too.Kenny and Citadel are like a plague in the stock market now. He will have no support moving forward.But let's not forget the Market Makers, banks, law firms and media. They deserve equal credit for being part of the lucrative short selling mafia and they will not be forgotten. Are community is so much more powerful than any company on the planet. After this you will see all sorts of cockroaches coming out like they were always on our side and supporting us and would love to work with us in the future on something. Why? Because in unity there is strength. In numbers there is strength and we have both. After this, many of us will move onto another play if they clean things up and many of us will move onto another play if they don't clean thing up, and we will spank their #$%$ again."
Do I hear $47? $47?
100 million real shares owed!! Period end of story!!!!
Hey has anyone heard fromJim Chanos who illegibly is shorting AMC. The last article he was crying about the small investor buying and holding. I guess he didn’t hear the news that Vanguard increased there long position on AMC bring there holding to about 42 million shares.
"baggie slayer, AMC is calling. you're scheduled for your daily beatdown!"
why are these people from the HOOD Still here???
"Nice 6% gain, and holding strong AH. 50 tomorrow!"
AMC has officially taken over HOOD on AH markets!!! To the MOON!!!!!!!!!
reddit not allowing new posts on AMC.. hmm
HOOD who ?
Bashers still here buy more!! Its that easy!
"So yet again Yahoo keeps deleting all the posts from AMC forum, it's ok they already lost the war...AMC to the MOON...Keep holding."
PFOF ban and lockup expiry on the horizon.GL longs
"SOLD every single share of AMC--Im out,its the right thing to do,"
"For the last 8 months we have discovered so much new information about the inner workings of the market. Things the hedge funds and Citadel wish we never found out because now we know how they ate pretty much able to print money. This money, which comes from retail investors was going mostly to those who were getting extra gravy from Citadel on their mashed potatoes. It's awesome what we and others across the world have done. We are directly responsible for many positive changes that have and will happen. That's all great for sure but as much as we and others should appreciate our tenacity, we are here today for one reason, to make money and lots of it. The amount of synthetic shares are most probably massive. This means that the hedges not only have to cover 100+ million shares but also every synthetic share sold by the various hedge funds. If we don't hold, we may never find out how deep the hedges problems are. If we do hold, they will be forced to show their hand."
Traded 125 million today still pretty low volume compared to what we are going to see. We had a nice move up thanks to Vangurd buying another 19 million shares today. Geeezz they must be holding around 63 million shares now. I guess they know what they are doing.... lol
Controlled squeeze AMC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can say right now id gladly pay 15 bucks and make fewer trades then let citadel watch every order with some AI algos and then go buy huge options positions based on our order flow. I mean talk about rigged
I'm in for 1200 shares don't sell off on me
Sell the hood before the crash 
Deleting AMC posts lmaoooo! Yahoo how is ur stonks doing?
Baggie slayer 5000's team Hahaha...they are cute though
"Had to come in the HOOD board to see the newest AMC comments/news. Sadly, Yahoo Finance is in bed with Citadel"
Last chance to move to A.M. C
So this is the new amc board  since yh wants to manipulate Amc's board
are we in the begining workings of a controlled squeeze?? or just FOMO? HOLD ON TIGHT TO THOSE SHARES FOLKS AND LETS FIND OUT TOGETHER ! RIGHT OVER AT AMC !! 
BOOM...50
Hit $50 soon

"To think for every hood share in the early stages could have purchased 2 AMC, now they are worth less. Worthless"
It just goes to show you how scared hedge funds are when they suspend the AMC chat board and then to top it off they delete messages off of HOOD that have to do with AMC...LMAO HODL
CHRISTMAS IS GONNA BE GREAT THIS YEAR THANKS KENNY
"Ortex check, AMC with a short interest at 17.13%"
"$HOOD $AMCBye bye HOOD... I suggest anyone who is still holding: get out now!! I still think that when it hits $36 ($2 below the IPO start) and still sinking, we are close to a squeeze at AMC... AND, I think it wall all come to a head on or around September 25th... I'm just sayin'... Viva la AMC!!!"
baggie slayer when you said today my precious stock will close at 30 i was so happy because i was hoping to buy some more for cheap you made me so sad and i don't believe in you anymore smh
Whewww. That was the longest minute watching that share price tug of war. APEs are victorious today!! Sets the stage for tomorrow!! We fight on. Proud of my beautiful APE Fam. Bullish AMC 
"Back in January, the CEO of Interactive Broker testified in Congress, that if the buy restrictions have not happened GME would have ran into the thousands. Since then, the institutional shorts have dug themselves a much bigger hole. They think that they can squirm their way out of this and it's business as usual. This time around, we're not just going after Melvin, Citadel, a wind fall or even a generational transfer of wealth. We're in position to ignite a new world order. We didn't create this condition. They did. We're just fixing it."
AMC’s a poppin’!!!
$AMC - This is the way!
Hedgy wait til Sept 3 when you need all that extra money on hand!! lol lol
Yahoo is blocking Hood again. Something big is going to happen this week. TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!!!
"$HOOD $AMCCitadel is now fighting its battle on 2 fronts..... TODAY, they are too busy TRYING to keep RH in the plus that AMC is breaking out...

The fact that AMC is now a fundamental play for institutions has got to be the biggest slap in the face of the shorts... #AMC
Amc price prediction for Friday
Sell hood buy AMC the best decision come join AMC 100k
"Just smile and wave boys, smile and wave. #AMCRocketBus"
"Folks we all know Hood will be popping up down and all around for awhile I’m sure, but pick your spots you can make good moneyAlso consider this stockTanger Outlets SKT, Motley Fool is liking SKT plus the 4.2% compounding dividend, that Motley thinks will be raised back to Pre Covid average of 7-8%. !!Also yahoo finance has some good articles on SKT currently, everyone suddenly liking Skt, plus SKT has had a high short % for awhile now , and that cycle of heavy short will be changing with even REDDIT crowd chatter, they love shorted stocks to buy and BLAST OFF , look for Tanger Outlets to pop into low 20s very soon , OPINION ONLY g luck"
"Tried Amc -1 ( still a mess), glad we have have Amc 2 -backup board.."
Bought 75 more AMC. Total 375. In at about 30 average. Just fun to buy and hold this stock. It will be in the 100s at some point.
Last 6 months you shut down freedom of speech! Is this right for everyday People who are investing? What's going on Yahoo? What are you hiding?
“Hello Kenny? Just give up already. We won THIS game. Time to pay us!”…
If payment thru order flow gets banned we have to pay for transaction fees?
AMC woohoo!
"Turtle/""Robinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,” said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. “Brokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.” Chitadel misled SEC on what they do to investors also"
AMC flying! Not a dead cat!
Buying 100 shares in AM thanks yahoo
"Could you imagine where AMC would be today without all the manipulation? Good because that is really where we are at today, forget the price you see and imagine the real one and hold for it. It's there. They can't hold it down. Look at the #$%$ poor effort today? How much did that cost them?"
AMC green in AH...Life is good...
AMC BUY BUY BUY!!!
"PFOR is not allowed in Canada nor Europe, and it's inherently unethical to sell your clients' orders to Market Makers for easy profits. Quick money will be erased easily as well. Once SEC takes action to ban PFOF, NSCC-010 takes effect & the buy/sell ratio of AMC continues to be 3: 2, let's see how the GREEDY SHFs manipulate the price to delay MOASS in a more creative way...or simply start to cover their short positions?"
HA HA WAIT TIL ALL THEM BUY ORDERS COME OUT OF THE DARK POOLS!!! LOL
That's some real Hood fomo with a take no prisoner 60 cent recovery.
AMC..AMC..amc
Bought 10 more AMC shares love the American Dream!
"I don't believe PFOF will be banned; the practice has been around since stock markets began. Brokers have been collecting kickbacks for ages and ages. However, one can expect whole host of regulations as to how order flows are processed to ensure free, fair and competitive market in trading of stocks."
AMC ready for liftoff!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
$AMC.. by far the most interesting and exciting stock in the market right now!
AMC looking good!! Go AMC!! Go APES!!! HODL and WIN!!!
AMC Ape Nation ROCKS ..2 da’ mooooon!
Vanguard bought 42M synthetic shares. Who said there are no more shares to buy?
SO I tried to put a short sell 1K shares at 50 and it marked it HTB (hard to borrow) and stated I need to pay interest to keep the position open and the annual interest rate Fidelity gave me???? wait for it... 1%.. so now we know how dirty this game is and how we must stay diligent until the end and that end is not so near my friends. #AMC
I could be totally wrong. seem like the movie stock might trigger the gamma squeeze this friday. look at the options chain for September 03.
"OH, Look what I said a few minutes about after hours. Amazing isn't it. Hey Baggie slayer, what did you say about tanking in AH? You are terrible."
Shorts
$AMC doubling tomorrow like it did on June 2nd?
I thought AMC’s volume was 104 million and now it says 127 million
"If you hold AMC and you're still using HOOD, you need to have your head examined. They actively took part in halting the January squeeze and has every intention to use your assets against you."
Haha! Amc TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE!
