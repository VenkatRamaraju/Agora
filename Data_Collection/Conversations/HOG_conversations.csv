Harley-Davidson is up 4.96% to 37.23
As older Harley riders retire from riding the next generation of blue collar workers don’t make enough to buy a new Harley any more. This company and products will change in ways that no one can predict.

"SummaryThe stellar performance of Harley-Davidson in Q1-21 has helped the stock rally 15% and settle at 10% higher than pre-earnings.The market seems willing to push the stock up even further based on guidance provided for FY-21.However, there's a long way to go before the company can start posting $5+ billion in annual revenues again, which makes the stock expensive at the current price.That being said, if you take the long-term view, which I usually do, the company is still a long way from achieving the kind of annual revenues it was posting before the declines began to show. Even a stellar FY-21 will only be on a YoY comparative basis rather than a turnaround to historical highs. Sadly, for now, a HOLD is the only recommendation that makes sense to meBeulah Meriam K"
The chips shortage and winter time will cut into their earnings.The high debt will crush the stock .It’s over for HOG .
Harley needs to stop pricing itself beyond the average consumers purchasing power

it's a beat
No volume it’s going down .
"I saw the upgrade today on Harley Davidson, so I took a look. There is no reason to buy this stock other than an upgrade by a bag holder of this stock. Good thing Harley records a sale when they force dealerships to take delivery of a bike. That is the only way they can record sales of an electric bike that no real Harley Davidson purist would ever ride."
"My brother in law just bought a beautiful Harley Davidson 1400 Road King, what a beauty !! The sales manager told us, sales were doing very well. I think HOG goes back to $46 - $49 levels after earnings next week. This is a great entry point at $37.00, will buy 5,000 shares Monday morning before Wednesday’s earnings call. Buy and hold this one will definitely make you money  !!"
"Trouble in paradise.The Harley-Davidson LiveWire is making the headlines yet again. After media outlets reported that the premium product meant to attract younger people to the brand failed to live up to the expectations, it is now victim of a false start. The Motor Company confirmed in a press release published on Monday that production of the LiveWire has been halted. This isn't linked to the models underwhelming sales, but rather due to a glitch in the quality controls, resulting in what the company describes as a ""non-standard condition""."
Major dumping by the big boys .High debt will crush this stock .33 is being generous.
"there is no plan, they are closing stores and slowing production.. time to sell"
"I want to be bullish but the company has a debt of 6 times the equity which is is quite difficult to ignore. Add to it the beginning of the end of gasoline engines. I don't know, I am having hard time imagining a Harley with an electric engine. That totally kills the spirit. Selling us electric bikes instead of vrods, breakouts etc is like asking us (Harley owners) to dance in women's dress. HD culture is all about rough and tough and cool dudes and gals jugging the vtwin, making a lot of noise. Also, I was looking at the charts to see just a few instances of sustained pop in the price, I could not find any. I want to buy some, but I am not sure. it does not make investment case, it doesn't make trading case. But I will watch"
"Glaring Problems With Harley Davidson That Everyone Chooses To IgnoreQuestionable Lending HabitsHarley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) is not exactly known to scrutinize applicants requiring financial assistance for a Harley Davidson purchase. The newer the bike you’re interested in, the better they will be able to do for you. They’re much more lenient with bad credit scores and the application process as a whole when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers.It’s not uncommon to be approved for a stupendously long-term loan, in an obvious effort to further extend monthly payment plans and make purchasing a Harley Davidson more attainable for the average shopper. While we most certainly appreciate this boost, it’s definitely a bit sketchy. Of course, when you really want one of these spectacular bikes, it’s easy to turn a blind eye to this.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
"Folks I am doing my short position homework today. I personally visited the following HD Dealerships, asked questions and looked around. 1. Cocoa Beach Harley2. Space Coast Harley3. Treasure Coast Harley4. Palm Beach Harley5. Alligator Alley Harley6. Peterson’s Harley 7. Peterson’s Miami Beach Harley 8. Peterson’s Harley South All stores very slow and several salesman told things have been slow. So I really thing earnings report will not be good. It will tank on Tuesday !!"
I think we’re at the start of a bull run I could be wrong but I honestly think we mite b. Wut do u guys think? Next stop 38 I’m hopin me can close above $40
"I have been trying to sell my 2015 ultra low for over a year and a half. I couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t sell. Not even one phone call. Then I researched how many Harley’s for sale in the country the number was 50,000 used motorcycles. The markets flooded. It’s a buyers market."
Road to 50 is now in sight just a few more $$$ and we’ll b their I told u guys we wear on our way n I didn’t lie we r headin tbere n will get their soon trust me
I covered and went long 36.39 . lol
Eleven days until earnings! We'll get to see the plan that Harley hasto turn around years of decline?This should be interesting.
"I'll post one more summary for anyone surfing around or considering these names. Investors have written off recreational products as dead. Most of these trade in the low teens or single digits, which is a serious discount to the market. Comps may be tough, but business is still booming. Consumers have records amount of savings to spend in the next year. Supply chain problems are working themselves out. Backlogs will take two to three years just to restock to historical levels. With some of these stocks, simple PE expansion to the normal ratios mean they would almost double.I would even lump outdoor products like $JOUT and $VSTO and autos like $F and $GM in here too. Totally unloved and poised for huge upside in the next 12 months.$WGO $THO $BC $PII $HOG $LCII $PATK $MBUU $MCFT $HMC"
Game over for HOG it’s time to turn off the light .
"HOG made me money being long in the 90s and 2000s. That was then, and this is now. Short now...Munitions manufacturing has helped revenues, but not enough to offset declines in in sales."
"Now even bad news is good?The Milwaukee-based motorbike maker said it had net income of $86.6 million, or 55 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $113.9 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier periodRevenue fell to $1.069 billion from $1.124 billionU.S. retail sales fell 3.6%The downhill slide has continued since 2014... EV motorcycles wont save Harley, they're too far behind the leaders."
Crazy how undervalued this is potential 20 bagger even at these prices harleys r flying off the shelfs I was at my local dealership the other day n they said pre orders were sky high year over year n the dealership looked empty cuz they can’t keep inventory in stock cuz people keep buying I think the stock will reflect that soon this is a rock solid company with A1 financials n a ceo that has a pulse of wit the consumer wants HOG along n strong 
"Quarterly results are only beating 2020 year, they are at or under revenue numbers when compared to 2019. Year 2020 was impacted by Covid and everyone knows that, so comparision should really be with 2019.so far in 2021, 9 month revenue at ~4.3 B, which means even if last quarter comes at 1.1B to 1.3 B, the total is same as 2019. No change on the ground situation in reality.This will remain in 27-43 range until the top line revenue beats or surpasses 2019 year revenue. Period"
I told you guys shorts better cover quick gonna see $40-42 today and u can take that to the bank
hog is going to rip violently upwards check your local dealership they can't keep the bikes in stock This is going to be a record year for Harley
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than HOG
"Over 40% of HD cycles are sold overseas and growing. It’s a smart decision for the company, to expand, and grab market share where they can. Sales have slumped in the US for years"
"10:04 ET - Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson has settled with shareholder Impala Asset Management citing ""the spirit of cooperation during trying times."" Impala had nominated two candidates to Harley's board. Now, Harley and Impala agreed to jointly choose a new board member. Harley will also pay $425,000 to Impala to cover half of the fund's out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the activist campaign. Activist investors have been ending campaigns early as companies focus on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic."
"Should be an up day for almost all stocks today as vaccine testsare progressing quickly.However, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo said Tuesday that they earmarked nearly $28 billion to cover credit losses last quarter, wiping out a huge chunk of profits made between April and June. JPMorgan, the largest US bank, reported a 51% plunge in second-quarter profit, citing the need to prepare for ""increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook."" Wells Fargo reported its first quarterly loss since the Great Recession. How does this affect Harley, with its almost half billion in debt?How will downturn affect financed bikes, etc."
"Worse than was thought!A miss and a miss:Harley-Davidson Inc. shares HOG, +0.72% slid 2.9% premarket Tuesday, after the iconic motorcycle company swung to a loss in the second quarter and unveiled an overhaul of its business that will see it exit certain markets and streamline its product line. Milwaukee-based Harley swung to a loss of $92 million, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter, after a profit of $196 million, or $1.23 a share, in the year-earlier period. Its adjusted loss per share came to 35 cents, short of the FactSet consensus for earnings of 11 cents a share. Revenue fell 47% to $865 million from $1.633 billion, ahead of the $761 million FactSet consensus. U.S. motorcycle sales fell 27% to $31.3 million, EMEA sales fell 30% to $11 million and Asia Pacific sales were down 10% to $6.9 million. The company is not offering guidance, given the uncertainty created by the pandemic."
Game over for Hog ?
"Ok, I’m befuddled. Polaris reported numbers much better than HD, has a much larger moat of products, and they’re price is down 3-5%. That’s not surprising in todays market, but HD’s increasing price is puzzling.Maybe one of you HOG proponents can explain why this discrepancy?"
"I don't even understand an electric bike. The whole HD thing is the engine soundAs a Harley rider, I think the company has a tough future ahead of it. Good luck"
Who is going to buy this expensive HOG in the winter time ? all mega caps are crushing the whole market .Gold and silver miners are cheap .
What an excellent quarter Harley-Davidson had !! I told you guys that motorcycles  were selling as fast as they reached the store !! Shorts better cover this baby is going back to $48 - $50.
