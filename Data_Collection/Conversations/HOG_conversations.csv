Harley us American as apple pie and is not going anywhere anytime soon could see it be acquired by a bigger player maybe Polaris would add it to its portfolio I’m buying more today it’s oversold
"Folks I am doing my short position homework today. I personally visited the following HD Dealerships, asked questions and looked around. 1. Cocoa Beach Harley2. Space Coast Harley3. Treasure Coast Harley4. Palm Beach Harley5. Alligator Alley Harley6. Peterson’s Harley 7. Peterson’s Miami Beach Harley 8. Peterson’s Harley South All stores very slow and several salesman told things have been slow. So I really thing earnings report will not be good. It will tank on Tuesday !!"
The pumper analyst will push Harley to $34 before earnings. That is the middle of the $31 and $36 new analysts year target  which in today’s market is really a few days or weeks. A stock use to take 6 months to a year to hit the price target... nowadays is practically immediately. Well let’s see what happens after earnings.

While Q1 earnings were strong and management's strategy for 'profitable growth' appears to have resonated with investors, we believe the market is under-appreciating the secular challenges ahead,"" warns analyst Billy Kovanis.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3685009-harley-davidson-falls-after-morgan-stanley-warns-on-secular-challenges-in-downgrade"

Game over for Hog ?
"Trouble in paradise.The Harley-Davidson LiveWire is making the headlines yet again. After media outlets reported that the premium product meant to attract younger people to the brand failed to live up to the expectations, it is now victim of a false start. The Motor Company confirmed in a press release published on Monday that production of the LiveWire has been halted. This isn't linked to the models underwhelming sales, but rather due to a glitch in the quality controls, resulting in what the company describes as a ""non-standard condition""."
"It's unfortunate, but the motor cycle industry in the USA is going downhill. The parents of the 70's and 80's trained males to be femboys and drink lattes and eat tofu, rather than be free. They would rather goto protests with Ocasio Cortez and have everything given to them by the"
Will be under $35 after earnings call.
"Questionable Lending HabitsHarley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) is not exactly known to scrutinize applicants requiring financial assistance for a Harley Davidson purchase. The newer the bike you’re interested in, the better they will be able to do for you. They’re much more lenient with bad credit scores and the application process as a whole when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers.It’s not uncommon to be approved for a stupendously long-term loan, in an obvious effort to further extend monthly payment plans and make purchasing a Harley Davidson more attainable for the average shopper. While we most certainly appreciate this boost, it’s definitely a bit sketchy. Of course, when you really want one of these spectacular bikes, it’s easy to turn a blind eye to this.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
Went short today. Maybe they’ll surprise with some fancy accounting but long term Harley will have great difficulties. Very little risk has been priced into this once great company.
"30k for their electric bike, is insane! why would anyone buy a 30k electric bike? and it's no longer made in USA. you'll spend more money charging it and limit your distance."

"HOG made me money being long in the 90s and 2000s. That was then, and this is now. Short now...Munitions manufacturing has helped revenues, but not enough to offset declines in in sales."
The country is going electric. Check out Acrimoto fun vehicles. Ticker symbol FUV which is flying today. They just bought a plant five times larger than the one they own now. The company is just getting started. The future is here.
Halting production this close to delivery tells me there's more to this problem than the are letting on.
Covering a few shares below $48.50... and I'll short more if it heads up again.Love when this moves up without reason.
loses 45% profits. divvies cut 95% 13th quarter in a row of earnings reduction. this is a penny stock. you're watching a company go slowly out of business that uses every trick in the book to sound better on paper. earnings 'beat' expectations even though it still decreased. lol.
They took on debt to grow .I covered this morning and went long at 41.35 and will reload at 44-45 .
"I spoke to owners of to dealerships, one in N.J. and one in PA., and both said their sales are way down due to covid-19. They also stated that no-one is interested in the Bronxs motorcycle. They feel it is not a mans bike, stated by many customers. Jim."
"Livewire as a brand, I'm not sure how that will work out.If its not Harley as a brand, can Livewire command a premium?Livewire bikes are more than 30% over priced."
"10:04 ET - Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson has settled with shareholder Impala Asset Management citing ""the spirit of cooperation during trying times."" Impala had nominated two candidates to Harley's board. Now, Harley and Impala agreed to jointly choose a new board member. Harley will also pay $425,000 to Impala to cover half of the fund's out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the activist campaign. Activist investors have been ending campaigns early as companies focus on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic."
"WOW. Just a blatant analyst pump and dump before earnings. Heavy bikes are not selling right now. Everyone that wants one bought it last year. And the electric bike will be a failure at it's outrageous price point. Come one, really? Do you hear anyone talking about that bike??? No one. The only thing that saves Harley is that they record the sale when the FORCE their dealerships to take delivery of a bike they can not sell. Harley is way over priced here and the new target price is a total joke."
"This company needs a lifeline of some sort, soon. Otherwise they are not far from BK. fair SP under $10 IMHO"
Amazon earnings miss and it’s down $120 bucks !!! Tomorrow the market will be down and HOG will be down big !!
"I like bikes. I like Harley's and Indians. I've ridden both. That said these bike cost more than a new car. The fuel economy is at times worse than a fuel efficient car. They make no financial sense but bikes rarely do. If you ride you know what I mean.That said, the market place for bikes is changing - people are increasingly looking for value. For that reason think HD has painted themselves into a corner long term with expensive glitzy bikes. Changing up their bikes waters down their brand but their reluctance to change will be their eventually demise. Young people are about tiny homes, wanting less, new technology, and travelling. They are more discerning and savvy. Furthermore, generations are becoming less wealthy now.HD is about being cool. What is cool is changing and HD doesn't appear to adapt. Take a look at the live wire - sadly overpriced and underwhelming when compared to their competitors.From an investment POV this could very well be a good time to buy. But make sure you know your exit. There are tougher times ahead for this leather clad dinosaur."
Way over valued
"Not only are these bad earnings, the reading between the numbers, current Q looks like 20,000-30,000 bikes shipping. That is going to lead to a big loss."
"there is no plan, they are closing stores and slowing production.. time to sell"
Markets are stretched that’s why short interest is creeping up everyday and everywhere.
New 52 week lows coming soon. Ouch!
"PE Ratio (TTM) 5,256.25Short at will."
They’ll run the price up so they will not have to pay a stock to dividend bigger payment to stock holders then the price will plummet
"Whats driving this, Robinhood investors on a vaccine high?"
OK I'm in ....A part owner of the Harley business. Yup electric bicycles. Its huge and getting much bigger. New management is stepping up their game and the brand is iconic. I expect to hold the shares until Elon Musk buys in or partners up . Batteries are the key and improvements are stacking up on each other. CATL already make a million mile battery for cars. bicycles ....take them camping in the new vacation close to home world.
"Not the image Harley needs to sell scooters!No masks, no common sense.."
Would be nice to get an update regarding the electric motorcycles
"This new CEO is putting a focus on EV Motorcycles, making the campaign's name ""The Hardwire"" and then buys $1,000,000+ of HOG's stock, sounds good to me. HOG's Return on Equity is only 6 right now but that's due to pandemic related problems (the 5-year average for return on equity is 25+%). The P/E and PEG ratio are only high because the earnings are currently in a slump due to Covid-19 warehouse closures. I also noticed in the last six months over 30 inside buys occurred versus 2 sales. Can Harley Davidson become cool again and gain popularity?"
How does a stock go up when it’s sales have declined for 11 straight qtrs.
"A lot of options here, all well under 30khttps://www.indianmotorcycle.com/en-us/motorcycles/"
Those Harley Puts I bought are doing work today. 
How long has Harley been in decline?What was its high point?I'm guessing a high point around 2001?
"Not sure what HOG's restructuring / rewire plan will entail,but I dont think the Bronx or Livewire are going to give themthe expected boost. ER should be interesting"
Frankly if you can afford to stay short this stock for the next 3 years you will make 100% on your money. YKITRW
"Detroit automakers are evaluating how they might pivot to making medical-grade respirators or ventilator. Why hasn't HOG, which has been on life support for years, found a way to make a contribution to this global pandemic? Wake up!"
"I was wondering how Harley could survive with such a limited product line, and such an expensive one at that. But many years ago they also made smaller machines. Maybe it's time to revisit that. Today I see heaps of scooters and these electric bicycle things (which do have pedals but look a bit heavy to actually pedal very far) littering the sidewalks, so these are apparently selling quite well. I'm still a fan of the heavy iron, but I do want to see HD survive even if it means fewer big bikes and more smaller models."
My guess is that Harley losses half or more of its market value!!!!
"this company has debt twice the size of its market cap. i wouldn't be a buyer here. this looks like a sinking ship. this company has an iconic brand, ..sad for America. some other company will scoop them up, but that will probably be after bankruptcy and the clearing of their debt ."
"Here we go, volume starting to increase on steady decreasing price, next accelerator is price delta down to consolidation at 33-34"
This stock has been in decline since end of Jan. Tarif ain't the problem.
HD is working on E- Bicycle price range $2500/5000. Competitors sold for $ 800-1500 .Would the public buy one in that price range?
"I saw the upgrade today on Harley Davidson, so I took a look. There is no reason to buy this stock other than an upgrade by a bag holder of this stock. Good thing Harley records a sale when they force dealerships to take delivery of a bike. That is the only way they can record sales of an electric bike that no real Harley Davidson purist would ever ride."
I shorted 5 k shares at 35.34 this Am . It’s way overpriced and will retrace back to 30 or lower on market weakness .
"It was older bikers who kept Harley going for this long, but we are getting old, the young don't want this brand, and the company is being run by non-bikers! No biker will ever buy an EV bike...especially for $30,000! We ride for the sound and we ride long distances! Harley will eventually die!"
Their last quarterly earnings were double that of estimates. They on the upswing with rest of america Reopening. They next big thing since the RV boom imho as American's enjoy the freedom of outdoors once more in a economy that left them and their wallets behind most pandemic
Harley needs to stop pricing itself beyond the average consumers purchasing power

Big bull run ahead get ur tickets for liftoff by purchasing shares b4 it’s too late seriously if u want to wreap the rewards then now is the time
this may be one of the worst messages i've heard from earnings call. How anyone can be bullish on this is beyond me.
"Nothin beets a harly these are top notch machines…… American engineered and produced…. This is a timeliness brand… any way u slice it this is an exciting business with potential that can’t be matched anywhere else on the stock market….. tell me a stock that has more potential… I’ll wait…. At the end of the day, those who don’t own a Harley won’t fully understand n that’s okay…. But when the rubber hits the pavemenint, that’s when the dog comes home"

Great bikes but s very poor investment.
Eleven days until earnings! We'll get to see the plan that Harley hasto turn around years of decline?This should be interesting.

"UBS weighs in on the decision by Harley-Davidson (HOG +9.8%) to lower inventory in the dealer network by limiting production for the rest of this calendar year.""The inventory strategy that HOG just communicated to dealers could suggest that at Street's 19% retail declines, consensus shipments would have to go to down closer to - 26-30% in order to reach inventory targets. That 600-1,000bps of lower shipments could impact consensus EPS by 20-35 cents, or a 15-27% reduction in EPS,"" warns analyst Robin Farley."

"Hog wants to continue selling high priced, high margin bikes, and that's not going to work. They are going to have to downsize the company and work on lower priced and higher sales volume vehicles just to survive. They need to maybe look at other ways of using their manufacturing plants to pay the bills; use motorcycle engines to power things other than motorcycles."
So much winning!
Bets on this opening up or down tomorrow?I think down.

"Harley-Davidson was in trouble before all of the coronavirus shutdowns, and things haven't gotten a lot better in the interim. But now, as H-D's factories in the US start to get back to work, the company has a new plan to break itself out of its longtime funk.Part of that involves paring back operations -- specifically production. The company is going to be making fewer models, with fewer available options and in fewer colors, and then it's going to make fewer of them, according to a report published Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal."
"15 Reasons Harley-Davidson Is In Serious Trouble In 2020Harley-Davidson has been struggling for years to keep up with younger companies, but they're in serious trouble in 2020, and here are reasons why:There are things in the auto industry most take for granted: The Big Three will still be a force even if Detroit is in rough shape. Europe makes the best sports cars. And Harley-Davidson will always dominate as the best motorcycles in the U.S. But in the last several years, that last point has become less sure. The fact is that Harley-Davidson never truly recovered from the 2009 recession, and things have been rough for them in the last few years. CEO Matt Levatich abruptly left in March after a tenure that saw the company's sales slump majorly.This was before the current pandemic threw the entire automotive industry for a huge loop, and many companies are struggling. But even before that, Harley-Davidson was entering 2020 in bad shape. The company suffers from a poor image, a lack of good products, and numerous mistakes that make it harder to get back on track. While some hope they can recover, 2020 could well be the beginning of the end for an American institution.15 Supply Chains Are Breaking DownThe current pandemic is wreaking havoc with the auto industry. For a company already facing issues like Harley-Davidson, it's even worse. The shutdowns of factories mean that Harley-Davidson has lacked in the simplest materials for everything from bike steel to even rubber for handlebars.While dealerships can be open, they have no new products coming in, and repair shops also lack the proper materials. The pandemic is exposing how fragile the auto industry supply chains are, and Harley is struck by their breakdowns."
"Should be an up day for almost all stocks today as vaccine testsare progressing quickly.However, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo said Tuesday that they earmarked nearly $28 billion to cover credit losses last quarter, wiping out a huge chunk of profits made between April and June. JPMorgan, the largest US bank, reported a 51% plunge in second-quarter profit, citing the need to prepare for ""increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook."" Wells Fargo reported its first quarterly loss since the Great Recession. How does this affect Harley, with its almost half billion in debt?How will downturn affect financed bikes, etc."
"I simply do not understand how HOG can be relevant in the Millennial market. I know people who love HOG, their products, their line of clothing (which I would never go near) and the noise, pollution, vibration and related downsides of their products. They love HOG. But they are old. Where is the future for HOG?"

"Historically UnreliableVia Harley-DavidsonAfter spending a lot of money to own these expensive motorcycles, you can surely depend on them to be reliable motorcycles, right? Wrong. The Harley Davidson brand is synonymous with unreliability. The brand felt the hit from this reputation and needed the AMF revival back in the ’70s to stay alive.Reliability issues trace back to numerous mechanical issues and varying models, spanning over the lifespan of this brand. After being plagued with this issue for so long, it’s now commonplace to see a Harley on the side of the road and not think twice about it. Most would barely bat an eyelash when seeing a Harley Davidson on the side of the road – it’s to be expected.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
"$15-17 is about fair value until HD can demonstrate that it can increase earnings for at least 1q to stop the bleeding. they can promise all they want with new bikes and new focus, but at some point they need to deliver and show it in the bottom line. yes the pandemic affected this Q and will the next one, but it has been 13 straight quarters of earnings decline. can't entirely blame the virus."

"Folks cash  in your gains before they are all gone !! HOG just broke to $38’s and it’s going down to $32 which is what it was only 2 weeks ago. Indian Motorcycle ramping heavy competition against Harley will not help HOG sales !! Also the worldwide  economy is slowing down. Buying such an expensive Harley in Europe will not work. The average Joe in Europe cannot afford a Harley and the Electric bike is out of the question ($30,000). I predict that Harley’s $30,000 electric bike will be a big mistake."
Their main customer base is 60 to 80 years old now. The young are too busy with college debt andtrying to buy a house. Not a great scenario.

"SummaryThe stellar performance of Harley-Davidson in Q1-21 has helped the stock rally 15% and settle at 10% higher than pre-earnings.The market seems willing to push the stock up even further based on guidance provided for FY-21.However, there's a long way to go before the company can start posting $5+ billion in annual revenues again, which makes the stock expensive at the current price.That being said, if you take the long-term view, which I usually do, the company is still a long way from achieving the kind of annual revenues it was posting before the declines began to show. Even a stellar FY-21 will only be on a YoY comparative basis rather than a turnaround to historical highs. Sadly, for now, a HOLD is the only recommendation that makes sense to meBeulah Meriam K"
HD is a dying breed . Their electric bicycle eh Motorcycle will not be able to compete.Their subprime loan will crush the balance sheet .It’s an easy short at 30 . IMO
"Harley-Davidson is in trouble. The company has seen 17 straight quarters of bad news, and the decline accelerates every quarter. It’s not a pretty picture for one of the most valuable and passionately followed brands in history. And while the causes for such a catastrophe are always complex, in Harley’s case, there’s a single fork in the road that exemplifies, if not explains, the death spiral that very well may be the end of the company.."

I would say that Harley-Davidson is one of the best shorts right now !! This one is an easy one folks. Their is not much steam left in this stock. Sell and lock  in your gains before it goes back to $31 - $32 again.

"What is Harley supposed to do? Donald John Trump has instructed his base to stop buying Harley products. Donald John Trump is predicting, with robust language and enthusiasm, that Harley is going to go bankrupt.Why? Because Harley is transferring some more manufacturing resources to EXISTING overseas manufacturing plants.Why? Because Trump’s mega tariffs and retaliations overseas make Harley products non-competitive in overseas markets.Why? Because Harley has a binding responsibility to it’s shareholders and employees to stay in business, in all markets.Harley simply stud up to Trump by defying him. And Trump has gone public encouraging people in his base to stop buying from them, and expecting they’ll go out of business as a consequence.What other President of the United States of America has encouraged his core base to stop buying from an American landmark business just because they defied him, and are looking out for preserving their business? And he predicts they’ll learn their lesson and go out of business."
As older Harley riders retire from riding the next generation of blue collar workers don’t make enough to buy a new Harley any more. This company and products will change in ways that no one can predict.
"Wait.......So all the new stock millionaires are running out and buying heavy, loud, expensive motorcycles? Do you really believe that? Even the electric bike is almost as much as a low end Tesla. This stock is at a five year high based on new targets by institutional bag holders. Amazing how corrupt the market has become. % year high is a joke for a company selling heavy bikes to customers who are now too old to ride. No one under 55 wants to pay 30, 000 plus for a loud heavy bike."

EV motorcycles wont save Harley, they're too far behind the leaders."
"Harley Davidson has for a long time been a production artist. They build and hopefully sell what they want to build, not what millions of potential customers need and want. They should do similar to what they did with Buell, a sub company with a different name to sell the inexpensive, but reliable quality transportation the younger generation needs. Harley doesn't need to sully their bar & shield or antagonize their fat men who ride fatboys, but, they need to produce a more salable product and generate more revenue like all other companies."
Millenials don't like motorcycles; they can't text and take selfies on them!
"Declining SalesHarley Davidson sales are on the decline and have been for quite a few years. Consumer Reports has been reporting weak sales for this bike brand which date further back than 2011. The biggest issue that Harley Davidson faces in this category seems to be a generational one. Younger riders are not only finding it difficult to afford these bikes, but they are also not as inclined to buy into the status associated with Harley ownership in the way that generations before them had so seamlessly embraced.With that status adoration they had in the past, it was easy for Harley to charge a premium price for their motorcycles and get away with it. That’s not the case anymore.."
"Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Sales Evaporate in Face of COVID-19 PandemicFirst-quarter motorcycle sales for Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) were as terrible as you'd expect, plunging 18% worldwide from the year-ago quarter and down more than 15% in the U.S. It doesn't bode well for Harley-Davidson's second quarter, which is typically its biggest sales period, and perhaps for several quarters to come. Harley-Davidson's revenue fell almost 6% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter while net income plunged 45% year over year to $69.7 million, or $0.45 per share, as the COVID-19 outbreak sapped sales globally.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/54bc84cb-a0b0-382d-be79-dddb298a8e98/harley-davidson-motorcycle.html"
CEO steps up and buys directly $1 million in shares at $32.50....nice! I may have to get in here.
It ran out of steam and will go back down to 26 ST then gradually will hit 22 then single digit. IMO
Is there still a dividend?
"Will cover my HOG short position at $34.00 today or in a few days. From $32.75 to $37.30 in a about 6 trading days before earnings without any good news. It’s going to be the typical sell on the news today and lock in profits. I say the shorts will prevail, it won’t be till mid 2020 that any big progress will be made. HOG will be dead money until they show growth in sales again. The $30,000 electric motorcycle will not sell good here in the states or international... its to expensive and you can not compare it to a nice FatBoy gas bike. Good luck today shorts and don’t panic cover early in the day, this thing will tank soon."
Been holding this stock for a long time nothing like a Harley I love hearing the roar of a fresh Harley pulling off the lot I remember when I got my first bike i pinned it out of the lot with the tires smoking one of the best moments in my life this is why I’m loyal to this brand because the feeling I get from pinning it on my hog is a feeling that not many will know about unless they buy a Harley
Hog- why would anyone buy on green when profits DROP like 45%?
"I have been trying to sell my 2015 ultra low for over a year and a half. I couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t sell. Not even one phone call. Then I researched how many Harley’s for sale in the country the number was 50,000 used motorcycles. The markets flooded. It’s a buyers market."

Harley service tech's. are telling people to stay away from the M-8. The motor is just not fixable.
I'm 62 years old retired and purchased a new Hog. Retirement will be great! Don't want to be seen riding next to an electric Harley.
Who is going to buy this expensive HOG in the winter time ? all mega caps are crushing the whole market .Gold and silver miners are cheap .
Major dumping by the big boys .High debt will crush this stock .33 is being generous.

"Bike sales down from the US to the far eastShipments, parts & accessories, merchandise, revenue, incomes, margins down across the board.Financing up, due to un-affordability, this is a sign of desperation.Buying shares back to help fudge the EPS.It's all bad across the board. Is this a strong economy or a rigged economy?"
"HD is not just one of the strongest brands on planet earth, it is also the finest motorcycle producer in the world, period. Never bet against an American Icon. Numbers can be fixed, debt can be repaid. This isn't Tesla, you're not going to see killer gains, but you sure as hell are going to see a brighter future. Best looking ADV bike on the market? Check. Most aspirational motorcycle, possibly even vehicle brand? Check. Huge super-fan base? Check. The writing is on the wall. Dismissing these guys is like dismissing Mcdonalds."
"Maybe the Trump organization should lead by example and bring all of it's investments, hotels and companies back to the USA. I guess the rules are different for other companies trying to make a profit for their shareholders."
"Be careful,They are comparing this qtr (opening up qtr) against a shut down qtr. This is not apples to apples. All of 2021 will be compared to a shut down year. Compare this to 2019, 2018 qtrs. HD also uses aggressive accounting practices."

"HD is a luxury item. People do not buy HD bikes bc they need a mode of transportation. With this new generation not even buying cars or getting drivers licenses, I am hoping that HD can get things rolling otherwise they will suffer the fate of Oldsmobile. I dont think even an electric bike can do much to impact sales. Far too easy for other companies to enter the e cycle race."
Harleys I am afraid are going away along with vintage cars . This younger generation does not care about what us older dud's did . Harley may sell a couple of electric bike but will not be near enough to save them . It breaks my heart to have to admit these facts. I really want Harley to live forever .
"Harley’s brand strategy in the ‘80s and ‘90s was to go all-in on Baby Boomers. It was as shrewd a choice as a brand had ever made: Boomers were a large, well-established segment with money to spend, proud of Harley’s American roots, and eager to hold on to their glory days. As Harley built on classic icons like Marlon Brando, it cashed in on suburban executives able to plunk down thirty or forty grand on a shiny new taste of rebellion.Then, in 2003, Harley bought Buell Motorcycles. Buells were a faster, rowdier type of bike that had been created by a young Harley engineer a decade prior. Buells didn’t look much like traditional Harleys, and they would have been unrecognizable to Marlon Brando. But they had the same spirit, updated for a new generation. Buell was the first bike of, among others, Walking Dead actor Norman Reedus, whose Gen-X take on rebellion sounded more like the Ramones and The Clash than The Beatles and The Stones.At first, it looked like Harley knew exactly what it was doing. The brand marketed Buells with smart, edgy ads that read exactly like Buells rode: a younger member of the Harley family with a new spin on the same heritage and values. Headlines like “It’s a fast, rude ride. But so is life,” screamed, “Harley is more than just your Dad’s bike.” Harley seemed to have concocted the perfect way to stay relevant as its cash-cow core began to age.But after just six years, Harley killed Buell. The move was ostensibly a reaction to its core demographic: Harley’s traditional audience didn’t like sharing its identity with the new kid on the block, and Harley chose to tie its brand to a product and a demographic rather than a spirit and an idea. There’s been nothing like Buell for almost two decades, and Harley has retreated to its comfortable and well-known lineup of classic V-twin bikes built for Boomers. But today, aging Boomers are buying fewer motorcycles, which is why the decision to end Buell coincides almost perfectly with the beginning of the decline that the giant still hasn’t been able to reverse."
"1 They're Cutting Down Big Time On ProductionGiven so many issues with factories shut down and the market itself unsteady, this should be no shock. The company has already laid off or furloughed much of its staff due to the factory shutdowns. Also, executives have seen a drastic cut in pay.Now, it's confirmed that when factories reopen, the production will be drastically slowed to the point 70% of dealers will not see any new motorcycles for the rest of the year. This means said dealerships will also be failing and hurting the bottom line. For a company already on the ropes, the current pandemic may be the knockout blow for Harley-Davidson."
"Now that Honda has released the Rebel 1100, might be neat to see HD beef up their Street line with a budget 1200 model."
"Wow, talk about getting blindsided.Harley reports declining revenue.If only there had been some warning signs"
"Harley-Davidson annual/quarterly revenue history and growth rate from 2006 to 2021.

"I agree that Harley is likely to survive, but maybe as a much smaller company. Perhaps where it was 30 years ago when they were happy selling about 50,000 bikes a year which about a doubling from a decade earlier. I at am not sure how many of the commenters here are motorcyclists. I have been riding since 1972 and have bought three new Harleys, the most recent a 2017. I have also owned BMWs, Triumphs, Hondas, Ducatis, etc. Every motorcycle manufacturer has their strengths and weaknesses. Yes, there is a demographic problem, and I am a perfect example at 68, but there are people who want to do things that are out of the mainstream. Motorcycles, and specifically Harleys, became almost mainstream from the early 1990s until somewhere around the Great Recession. Call it 2006 or 2007. The people buying new bikes today are riders for the most part and the folks who bought bikes as Butt Jewelry are mostly gone. Long story short, the only thing that could kill Harley is poor decisions at the top (think MV Agusta) and a huge increase in bad loans on bikes that are under water. Harley Davidson has been around since 1903 (or 1904 according to some folks) and my guess is that they will make it to 2103 in one form or another. And NO I don't work for Harley or a dealer and I don't own the stock. I just love bikes."

"Associated With Bad Boy ImageWhen you think of Harley Davidson as a company, it may not just be the bike that pops into your mind with vivid imagery. The “bad boy image” is clearly attached to ownership of this motorcycle, and is something that everyone purchasing a Harley either embraces or overlooks. This is definitely known as a “bad boy bike”, boasting an aggressive sound and a widely dominant culture of bikers that look, and sometimes act, as loudly as the bikes they ride.Everything associated with Harley Davidson seems to be aligned with projecting a bad-boy, ultra-cool, don’t-mess-with-us persona. From the attire that is branded to the accessories that are sold, every aspect of Harley Davidson perception seems linked to being part of the bad-boy-club.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
Let them take it higher !! The higher it goes the better... it will crash after earnings.
"Ok, I’m befuddled. Polaris reported numbers much better than HD, has a much larger moat of products, and they’re price is down 3-5%. That’s not surprising in todays market, but HD’s increasing price is puzzling.Maybe one of you HOG proponents can explain why this discrepancy?"
"Most of those who comment here seem to be bearish on Harley Davidson. And based on the historic evolution of sales and demographic of current Harley owners, I would be too. But I think most of you dismiss to easily the impact of the value of the brand. It's still top of mind when you talk about a motorcycles. On top of that, Harley is ready for the future challenges (Electrification, cleaner watercooled engines etc.) Also the new Pan America model is very well received by the motorcycle press. Even in comparison with the top seller, the BMW GS 1250, it holds it's own. And at a reasonable price for that market. The livewire was great but overpriced for most clients. But the Pan America is priced for success. The new engine is also very well received and opens new possibility for more modern bikes. If you only focus on historic analyses, you are missing the drivers of a turnaround."
"Harley Davidson is back on track selling motorcycles  like crazy and increasing production in all factories because the demand is incredible !! They have reduced their $8.2 billion debt by half last week. Folks this is the time to buy the stock cause everyone wants a Harley. Why do you think the stock went from $22.50 to $29.50 today, $7.00 a 31% increase in 10 or 11 trading days. I think with the awesome earnings it will jump to $45 like a crazy technology growth company. Lol  who the helm is drinking the cool aid ???"

"With this stock price don't miss your lifetime opportunity to sell it, three years high today."
"Plenty of politics noise on this board, but no sound advice. Blame The Donald for stock's decline?? That is a cop-out for those who are obviously holding a handful of HOG's bad stock. Lesson #1: Try buying/selling based on merits of company.....you may be surprised to find you could make some money. Lesson #2: Sell when things smell (hint: now). Holding onto a story-stock who has already run it's course is bad investment strategy and looses money EVERY TIME."
"Sad, but largely true."
I took some off the table at $35.45... HOG up to fast with slowing sales and cut to neutral. Great company don’t get me wrong but I think is to rich at these levels.
"U.S.Steel CEO said steel tariffs would only add one cent to an aluminum can and $700 to an auto. Harley says $2,200 increase also because steel prices have gone up. They still want to buy Chinese Steel I guess."

"Glaring Problems With Harley Davidson That Everyone Chooses To IgnoreQuestionable Lending HabitsHarley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) is not exactly known to scrutinize applicants requiring financial assistance for a Harley Davidson purchase. The newer the bike you’re interested in, the better they will be able to do for you. They’re much more lenient with bad credit scores and the application process as a whole when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers.It’s not uncommon to be approved for a stupendously long-term loan, in an obvious effort to further extend monthly payment plans and make purchasing a Harley Davidson more attainable for the average shopper. While we most certainly appreciate this boost, it’s definitely a bit sketchy. Of course, when you really want one of these spectacular bikes, it’s easy to turn a blind eye to this.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"

"From $32 last Wednesday to $36.50 yesterday... I don’t think it can hold. We are going back to $30 or lower after earnings. Sales have been very weak worldwide. The economy is slowing down and having a HOG is a luxury item. Good company don’t get me wrong, but it has come up to fast on no news."
MAGA!!! Way to go 'Merica!!
HD has been on a downward trend for several years. Do not see anything that is going to change the trend!!!
"HOG is moving some production, but the point is, HOG is in trouble, before the trade thing. Demand is dropping and motorcycles have reached top pricing, cutting demand into the future."
Has anything really changed for HOG?I think it continues its long downhill coast.Management has failed.
Tough to service debt with no revenue. Tough to grow revenue post-covid when product fast becoming ancient history.
Harley needs to go private to escape the pressure from the market before they die and kill off an iconic American brand. nothing wrong with being a niche/boutique product that you can sell and run as you wish and answer to no shareholders
Harley Davidson = Made in China

"Their last ex-dividend date was May 29. theoretically they should go ex-dividend this week for the next quarter. However they have posted nothing to that effect, so we called investor relations department at Harley-Davidson to find out what is happening with the dividend and we were told that they did not know at this point either. They told us to stay tuned to see if the board was going to declare a dividend or not for this quarter. this is obviously very strange and concerning."
This is up b/c the market is up 300 pts. Not sure how earnings will be but it makes sense that these guys will be hurting and don't think guidance will be good if they give much at all.
"LOL. Memories of a long time HD rider (pans &shovels) I got into this early on (1990) but unfortunately I didnt have much money back then, so I bought four shares, got a paper certificate. Anyway, the stock rapidly split 3 or four times. It was doing great. Of course, being a young guy, sooner or later I needed the money to get out of some jam I got myself into. So I cashed most of it out a few years later. I still have four HD shares for nostalgic reasons. Now Im more successful and invest elsewhere. Anyway, all the best to the die-hard Harley investors!"
"Harley Davidson's practice of calling a forced delivery on dealers as a SALE is bogus. No one will pay $30,000 for a bike with batteries. Their vision of customers is messed up and their sales accounting is shady financials. Thank goodness that this is an institutionally controlled stock. Hedge funds control the trade. The new crooked wall street."
"A lot of misinformation. Harley is only shifting production to Europe for bikes that will be sold in Europe. It will not impact domestic sales; those bikes will still be manufactured in the USA. As for the boycott, Harley has probably the strongest brand identity in the world and Harley riders aren't going to switch to another brand just because Trump is unhappy with the company."

"Harley Reports 2Q Loss As Retail Motorcycle Sales Drop 27% GloballyHarley-Davidson Co. said retail motorcycle sales fell by more than a quarter in the three months ended June 28, reflecting how consumers pulled back on spending as the coronavirus spread earlier this year.Harley on Tuesday said consumers purchased about 52,700 motorcycles globally in the second quarter, down from 71,800 the year earlier. Sales fell 27% in the U.S., the company's largest single market, 30% in the region including Europe and the Middle East, and 10% across Asia.At the end of the quarter, about 93% of Harley dealers around the world had their stores open, following interruptions earlier this year caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said.Overall, revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 53% from the year earlier to $669.3 million in the second quarter. Analysts predicted $761 million for the period, according to FactSet.Milwaukee-based Harley reported a loss of $92.2 million, or 60 cents a share, down from a profit of $195.6 million, or $1.23 a share, the year earlier.Excluding restructuring expenses and after other adjustments, Harley said its loss for the quarter was 35 cents, weaker than forecasts from analysts.Harley in July said it would cut roughly 700 jobs around the world, or about 13% of its global workforce. The company has said those reductions were part of its broader overhaul plan.Even before the coronavirus created new challenges for Harley, the company had been pursuing efforts to reach younger and more diverse customers and develop new products to kick start stronger growth.The company said its turnaround plan had resulted in $250 million in cash savings, excluding restructuring charges, at the end of the second quarter.Harley also said on Tuesday that it isn't providing a forecast due to the uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic."

Why are you not defending your upgrade?“We have long been among the most vocal of Harley-Davidson’s critics, and yet through both direct action and unintended circumstance, we now find the combination of potential demand drivers and margin opportunities to be extremely compelling,” Hardiman wrote in a note to clients.So you upgraded HOG. We are wanting you to defend this upgrade? I guess throwing darts is the latest way to determine an upgrade or not!!!"
"Harley invested millions in marketing to create an in-your-face tough-guy image that simply isn't connecting with younger riders. This decision was made years ago, aimed at attracting Baby Boomers who didn't see themselves as hippies, but it's left a lasting, dated impression of the brand in the minds of most Americans.."
"Twin Cam Engine ProblemsOne of the most central and most commonly overlooked issues with Harley Davidson bikes lies within their Twin Cam Engines, specifically, with the design aspect of the cam chain system. The plastic shoes rest on the cam chains and actually wear out over time. Talk about a design flaw! When the shoes rub against each other, the friction and constant contact with the other shoes wears them down. Left unremedied, the entire engine of the Twin Cam will be destroyed.Weak durability of the shoes equates to frequent replacing- roughly every 40,000 miles or so. To compensate a bit, a fan assisted oil cooler can be applied to assist with these twin cam engine problems.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"

"Worse than was thought!A miss and a miss:Harley-Davidson Inc. shares HOG, +0.72% slid 2.9% premarket Tuesday, after the iconic motorcycle company swung to a loss in the second quarter and unveiled an overhaul of its business that will see it exit certain markets and streamline its product line. Milwaukee-based Harley swung to a loss of $92 million, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter, after a profit of $196 million, or $1.23 a share, in the year-earlier period. Its adjusted loss per share came to 35 cents, short of the FactSet consensus for earnings of 11 cents a share. Revenue fell 47% to $865 million from $1.633 billion, ahead of the $761 million FactSet consensus. U.S. motorcycle sales fell 27% to $31.3 million, EMEA sales fell 30% to $11 million and Asia Pacific sales were down 10% to $6.9 million.

There's a lot of negativity on this board.Time to buy.

Harley contracts manufacturing of parts to plants located all over the world, including Germany, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, and Mexico."
"I want to be bullish but the company has a debt of 6 times the equity which is is quite difficult to ignore. Add to it the beginning of the end of gasoline engines. I don't know, I am having hard time imagining a Harley with an electric engine. That totally kills the spirit. Selling us electric bikes instead of vrods, breakouts etc is like asking us (Harley owners) to dance in women's dress. HD culture is all about rough and tough and cool dudes and gals jugging the vtwin, making a lot of noise. Also, I was looking at the charts to see just a few instances of sustained pop in the price, I could not find any. I want to buy some, but I am not sure. it does not make investment case, it doesn't make trading case. But I will watch"
Overbought at this point .
"Lower Volume on higher stock prices = Big Downturn coming !!Analysts- “Harley-Davidson Inc gained 2.52% in the last trading day (Friday, 10th Jul 2020), rising from $25.75 to $26.40 , and has now gained 4 days in a row. It will be exciting to see whether it manages to continue gaining or take a minor break for the next few days. During the day the stock fluctuated 3.84% from a day low at $25.55 to a day high of $26.53. The price has risen in 6 of the last 10 days and is up by 8.15% over the past 2 weeks. Volume fell in the last day by (-880.50) thousand shares and in total, 3 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $87.09 million.

Total revenues from Motorcycle and Related products, which form the bulk of overall revenues, declined 8% year over year to $1099.8 million in the reported quarter."
If you are up on Harley-Davidson you better sell now before it tanks !! Sales have been in the decline since 2014 and the new young men are not into the Harley’s. Only the older dying generation buys the bikes . This is company will end up going private when the stock goes to $8 to $10 dollars. Sell and move on before you lose all your investment in Harley-Davidson.

But if you think they are buying $30,000 heavy noisy bikes over there, you are fooling yourself. I see they are trading this stock up on hyped up good pumps. But this will end badly. No one is buying the electric Harley. Good thing Harley records a sale when they ship the outrageously expensive bike to dealers otherwise there would be very few sales."
"This makesno sense, I expected the big initial drop we saw earlier followed by a slow tailing down, not up! Any theories on what has buyers interested in this dog?"
bikes over priced
"I HATE to see anything negative to companies I genuinely care about. But, i think a short position is inevitable."
"Thoughts on the Pan America?Harley killed a lot of designs but went forward with this one.Perhaps because it was nearly ready for production.Pan America faces a tough market, with BMW and KLM being very well established,but it does sound like Harley did a decent job with this one. Not sure how I feel about liquid cooled though?"
Wait til their subprime loans get default and we will see low teen to single digit . IMO
Look at the 5 year summary/chart. This company has been losing value since 2013. This has nothing/very little to do with Tariffs.

I have had 8 new Harleys over past 25 years. I sold my last one this spring. For Harley people the models you would want are 35-45 grand ! The small sportsters are not going to do it for seasoned rider. I cant wait to see who would buy the Live wire? Big money without the Harley sound !
"Harley Davidson cannot sponsor motorcycle  racing... another big mistake !! Let the other companies shine & showoff in front of the racing community, while Harley-Davidson sits on the sidelines. This does not make sense:“Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) has a rich history in motorcycle racing that spans over 100 years, but amid falling sales and purposeful spending cuts, it has announced the company is no longer backing a racing team. It makes sense that Harley-Davidson would cut racing from its budget. After laying off hundreds of employees; withdrawing from numerous global markets, including India, one of the biggest in the world; and narrowing the selection of models it will build; financing a racing team is an extravagance”."
"Heading back to three dollars, and just for the record, Chief Financial Officer John Olin did not quit he was Fired. Chief Financial Officers do not quit these types of jobs. Beleave me, I worked in the industry twenty five years. Jim."
