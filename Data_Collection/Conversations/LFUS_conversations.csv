"just jumped in.......fingers crossed for good 2019 guidance and a nice bump to the dividend payout.....mgmt states that they plan to pay our 20% FCF, so I am guessing a 25% hike in div payout based on 250M FCF in 2019.......fingers crossed, but should be a double in 4-5 years, excluding dividend"
really need to up the dividend with this growth.
