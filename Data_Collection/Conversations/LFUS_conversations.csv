"just jumped in.......fingers crossed for good 2019 guidance and a nice bump to the dividend payout.....mgmt states that they plan to pay our 20% FCF, so I am guessing a 25% hike in div payout based on 250M FCF in 2019.......fingers crossed, but should be a double in 4-5 years, excluding dividend"

"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 51.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that they would post earnings of $1.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.67, delivering a surprise of 39.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times! I hope they keep it up "
