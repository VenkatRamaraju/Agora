"Can someone help me understand how is an average tasting pizza company worth so much with stock up 220%+ in 5 years? Are there significant growth tailwinds ahead? Food/restaurant seems very cut throat and their product seems average at best.It does like they price down their foods and hence compete on being value meals? Also, seems like they are very invested in tech and own their delivery infrastructure so cost advantages? Overall, seems like they have realized efficiencies in their costs, digital transformation, keeping prices low and have a strong brand and leadership team?But, it still beats me that it’s still very average pizza at best and the company’s product isn’t the best out there. I guess their strategy and positioning is based on ‘cheap pricing, strong branding, cost efficiencies’ since you can’t really create that much of a ‘difference’ in pizzas :-). Beats me why they are performing better than a lot of tech, Fintech and good solid companies?Thoughts on this and if this is worth buying for the long term?"
I've never been so excited about shorting a stock of my life and I've never done it twice but I've seen what happens when these high flyers come down I'm telling you I'm on short a thousand shares Monday morning and I guarantee you this thing comes back down to 400 300 easy
Wait until 350 to buy
"A few months from now, this will be nothing more than a 'blip' like August 2019 and it will eclipse 500 again."
Papa John's is nipping at DPZ' heels. They have a huge expansion planned.

DPZ is up 220% in just 5 years.
Nice; added 100 more shares within the last hour before closing.
Plenty of room to drop several hundred.
"Look for DPZ to break above 1,000 before the end of the year - we're goin higher - much higher."
Shorts have been destroyed on DPZ. I’m expecting BROS to be another long-term winner.
wasn't this just at 522 ?.. after hour
Bullish

Earnings prediction tomorrow?
could this stock reach 1000?
Been buying the dips for 15 years. Made money every time. best stock I own. Sometime about 8 years ago it so they made so much profit they had a special dividend if $3.00 per share. I owned 500 shares. used it to buy even more.
A P/E of 39. Wow.
I have been buying these dios for 12 years and it bounces back everytime. best stock I own.
Unfortunately this is going to under 400 with the bad earnings
"Looking at the last Q report the thing that stands out to me is they spent over $1 billion buying back stock. What is disturbing to me about it is they used debt to do it. Their costs are exploding across the board and next year will be far worse. I am in the food business and by Jan 1st we will have raised prices 10% across the board in 6 months. Not only that, shipping costs are also exploding with no end in sight. I've been in the food business for over 35 years and I've never seen pricing pressure and shortages like this. The question is, why is the company buying expensive stock and using debt to do it? This is not an Domino's problem only and it will affect everyone in the business. IMO, restaurant stocks arefacing a tsunami of raising costs in 2022 and their share prices do not reflect that reality."
I'm not missing out in this dip.
"pizza places using UberEATS, doordash and GrubHub are stealing dominos market share and also their labor pool.Up down, whatever but without huge labor changes in 5 years or less this company is toast"
"I'm ordering a Domino's pizza right now, with some extra GREEN on it."
"could be sideways declining for a couple more months, not touching"
come one dominoes . stop playing games .. keep going up higher ..I wanna see you at 600 by tomorrow afternoon... you hear me dominoes
"I was never interesting in investing in a company that makes tomato bread and wings, even when the pandemic was at it height. Just me though. I thought, what do people really need in this modern technological world, where you don't need to leave your house or car? Chips (not potato chips either)."
will dominoes reach 600 by the end of 2021 ?
