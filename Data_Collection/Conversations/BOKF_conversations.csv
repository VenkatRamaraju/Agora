"As per Conf Call right now - they have a very low energy loan reserve vs other banks. Sounds like head in ""the sand"". Had ""some"" deferral requests from Casinos so far - mostly from closed Indian Casinos and if they default bank will get a cut of the cash flow in future from the casinos. Not many significant deferral requests in hotels and colleges. ""yet."""
"The new worry for BOKF is courtesy of Trump acting against American consumers and colluding with OPEC+: we’re talking about limits enforced by law (that may eventually prove unconstitutional, though it’s not a sure thing), which could mean that debtors can’t repay their loans, even if they wanted to. At least under the status quo, debtors could keep pumping oil. Trump’s maddening desire for a deal that benefits the al Saud and Putin fortunes, to say nothing of the ayatollahs in Iran, could spell doom for BOKF and other concentrated energy sector lenders. Will the government pay for the debtors, using taxpayer money now, having interfered in the free market? Going long on BOKF is a bet on that."
