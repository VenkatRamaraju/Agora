Not a good sign at all. And there is more to lose when earnings are not on target with negative sentiment already in place.
Why took FDA so long to release the result?

Per the Q1 CC (I listened to it few days ago) the sales force was increased from 12 to 50 to help start selling the FDA approval that was denied. But these staff prior to the FDA decision were going to sell RYANODEX as they only had around 1000 of the 5000 or 6000 hospital. They added 120 new accounts.

"This stock, it's like people are skittish about it. Does this mean the company is hiding something which will suddenly be revealed. There is little news & they seem to do what they say. I keep looking for a bottom today to end the obvious shake up. Is it rational to sink $13.00 a share after blow out earnings?"
Shorts have massively started shorting from as low as $20 a share. And Irina Koffler has always been on their side. Shorts are trapped here big time. They are desperate ! This disapproval of the extension label to EHS doesn't any any imaginable way justifies the pps decline from $97 to the current level. It's becoming very much intriguing. GLTL We will win!

The read between the lines : I personally like when someone who has 18 years in investment banking becomes CFO! Besides the recent participation of Riggs in the press conference was awful indeed. (as well as a new president though). So the question is Who? Teva or Eli Lilly?

"Having a ridiculous time trying to find out the details of the CRL from the FDA site.There's been a LOT of planning (and cost) that's gone into this project. The company is EARNING money-and has aa decent cash & receivables amount. So I definitely see them defending this product-unless the ""additional trial"" is absurd. The reults thus far have been stellar. If someone God forbid dies this summer from EHS, the FDA will have A LOT to answer for."
EGRX is up 6.75% to 42.84
"Stock Buyback seems to have been terrible timing at least and at worst a terrible waste of cash!Only thing to ask is where is the bottom?Will this hit 30's like in past, or is that too low?I thought 48 looked good, but am holding off for a bottom. Will it be a capitulation low that is the buy in sweet spot?"

More good news for EGRX. They will be joining the S&P small cap 600 on Sept 1st. EGRX will be moving higher. I have the current long term value at $100.
Very worried about the deal. They have been buying back shares by the current cash flow and offering $200 million now. Not to much Consistent. They must give more information to the small investors. There is not a fair play from the board of directors. I hope new more information before the market opens tomorrow.
No news!!! Bad news! Not sure it's a great thing if we didn't get any news yet!!

The PDUFA date was Sunday, July 23, 2017.Eagle will issue a press release once the FDA has made its determination and communicates with the Company."
