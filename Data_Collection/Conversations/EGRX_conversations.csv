Very worried about the deal. They have been buying back shares by the current cash flow and offering $200 million now. Not to much Consistent. They must give more information to the small investors.

Shorts have massively started shorting from as low as $20 a share. And Irina Koffler has always been on their side. Shorts are trapped here big time. They are desperate ! This disapproval of the extension label to EHS doesn't any any imaginable way justifies the pps decline from $97 to the current level. It's becoming very much intriguing. GLTL We will win!
missed earning. Big loss today.

"If you're for long, no need to panic. It's a good company in my eyes, great balance sheets. Go long!!"
Not a good sign at all. And there is more to lose when earnings are not on target with negative sentiment already in place.
"I hope Eagle doesn't f up the approval in Oct, like they did for Ryanodex for EHS. Large paper loss but unbowed."

More good news for EGRX. They will be joining the S&P small cap 600 on Sept 1st. EGRX will be moving higher. I have the current long term value at $100.
"Having a ridiculous time trying to find out the details of the CRL from the FDA site.There's been a LOT of planning (and cost) that's gone into this project. The company is EARNING money-and has aa decent cash & receivables amount. So I definitely see them defending this product-unless the ""additional trial"" is absurd. The reults thus far have been stellar. If someone God forbid dies this summer from EHS, the FDA will have A LOT to answer for."

"This stock, it's like people are skittish about it. Does this mean the company is hiding something which will suddenly be revealed. There is little news & they seem to do what they say. I keep looking for a bottom today to end the obvious shake up. Is it rational to sink $13.00 a share after blow out earnings?"
I'm betting on positive news.
Per the Q1 CC (I listened to it few days ago) the sales force was increased from 12 to 50 to help start selling the FDA approval that was denied. But these staff prior to the FDA decision were going to sell RYANODEX as they only had around 1000 of the 5000 or 6000 hospital. They added 120 new accounts.

"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
The read between the lines : I personally like when someone who has 18 years in investment banking becomes CFO! Besides the recent participation of Riggs in the press conference was awful indeed. (as well as a new president though). So the question is Who? Teva or Eli Lilly?
