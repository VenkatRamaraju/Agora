"This is a YUGE overreaction. Of course subscribers are down - this represents a shift from traditional TV service to streaming. Note Internet customers are up - we are converting customers to streaming, not losing them."
"I said this before, and I'll say this again. Every time I think that I should sell this stock (which I got by way of Time Warner), it jumps. I just guess I'm still going to ride it.And I have my doubts - why isn't wireless, particularly 5G, going to replace this. Why isn't there some other cheaper competitor. Isn't there a time where there aren't any way to grow income?But, for the time being, I'm pleased that I have a nice amount of shares."
a #$%$ OF A COMPANY cant watch TV for all of there spectrum ads.
Charter will be Altice with the profits from earnings ... Optimum footprint too good to pass up at the current price.
"I’m telling y’all, this is a great buying opportunity. The analyst has it very wrong. They are focusing on video, but revenue is increasing rapidly in other areas of business. Video may be under some pressure, but is still growing. Beep beep beep, backing the truck up here."
"buy Altice already , it's a fire sale now!"
"Using the Spectrum Roku app, Spectrum's audio on Fox News cuts about every third sentence effectively making the meaning non-understandable. I believe this is intentional because it doesn't happen on any other channel, or during the commercial breaks. More Cancel culture?"
How is this companies stock price at these levels with the Roku platform? Talk about major overvalue
Ring Ring ..Hello SoftBank this is Charter are you still willing to give us $540 a share for a merger ?..LMAO
"CHTR is a strong, strong buy. Broadbanding and connectivity and speed are becoming increasingly important as times go on, and with stocks like ZM promoting virtual chat CHTR will be big in that area too. Say what you want about it's customer service, the simple fact is this stock has both a big cash position on its balance sheet, huge free cash flow, and more important a 6 percent free cash flow yield and a 33 percent long term growth rate. 6 percent FCF yield tells us that even at these levels the stock is cheap. I fully expect CHTR to trade at $1000 in a few years and I believe the recent pullback is an opportunity to get involved. Bottom line, I've only discovered a handful of stocks over the years with both a big FCF yield and a large earnings growth rate. This name is a golden nugget amidst a sea of rocks."
"Hey tom, please pick up your phone and switch to another cable service. Would luv to hear your new complaints about Frontier and DirecTV for a change."
OK now we know why CHTR is now big from last week and getting crushed this week. If Malone is no longer getting a vote that might have an impact. Maybe some insider knowledge on that or possible bad earnings coming out next Tuesday. Sorry to sound negative though we are heading back up. For the record I am long. Good luck to us longs hopefully I am wrong would love to be.
"We operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.$CHTR Charter Communications Annual Report https://sec.report/Document/0001091667-19-000029/#sA3775CFA15BF5D2C920D076FCE22D6C6"
"Charter needs to remove downed lines in New Fairfield, CT ASAP. Lines are interfering with ability of school buses to drive safely! Please restore service promptly as well - customer service on phone has been less than responsive."
Way overpriced - should be a $200-$250 stock. Highly over-inflated. If there is ever a real correction this should take a serious nose-dive.
"Kevin is correct that Charter should buy VIAC. VIAC would want at least $75/share , but totally worth it."
Report: SoftBank's moves on Charter could signal new Sprint merger effort
I don't care about the stock. I care about the cost of Spectrum cable services.Overpriced. Paying for stations nobody wants. Endless commercials on every channel.Overpriced. Overpriced. Overpriced.
why chtr borrows from the market several times a year to buy back shares if they have such good fcf?
"Insider just sold 225,000 shares. If Reddit or other savvy investor groups could afford to short at this price, this is prime target to be shorted down to less than $300 in my opinion. Nothing about this company justifies evaluations above $250/share."
"Too much debt, not enough revenue, and growth will be deteriorating as cable goes away... this will be a slow bleeder unless someone saves them with a buyout"
Charter should be have more attention then all the FAANG stocks. The rocket is about to take off
Buffett getting slammed. 1st Kroger and now Charter
Why the U-turn by Wells Fargo on this stock? Who knows?
Having just experienced hopeless customer support I wonder about the future of the company.
Could Charter be included as one of the parties interested in buying VIAC/Viacom . VIAC strong content with increasing momentum in streaming . VIAC strong cash position and low debt with strong & growing profitability .
"Here we go! KeyBanc just raised their price target to $515 based on $16.8 billion 2020 EBITDA. The TWC integration costs and network upgrade investments are winding down. Hear me now believe later, this company is a cash gusher waiting to erupt."
"Look for a bid for LUMEN within 6 months. Lumen cleaning up balance sheet by selling of non enterprise-LEC legacy infrastructure. Raising cash to assist with the financing of the transaction. Charter to get massive core capacity, international reach to grown International customer base."
"Care less with their earnings are, I work for the company. The reason they make so much in revenue and bring home hardly any in earnings is because of the bloated software systems and slow Internet for their locations to provide customer service. They should reward the loyal customers and employees with lower rates rather than overcharging their loyal customers and giving peanuts to the employees and giving benefit to new customers. If they could Maintain their own customer base and grow new business, that would be wise, but since they don’t know how to do that, their days are numbered.￼￼￼"
"What a joke this is. Great earnings, revenue up, EPS up.Yet down 5%, because it fell short of Wall Street's subscriber growth target. Wall Street knows the target is ridiculous, but they don't care, since they are shorting all cable stocks. Manipulation at its finest. Only way to stay immune to these kind of short attacks is to not use leverage and hold till they eventually decide enough is enough and cover."

I sure wish this stock would do a split.
Still blows my mind people are willing to short the largest TV/internet provider in the US. This will continue to rise for the next 15 years
"I had AT&T internet for the last 10 years, and really got tired of them jacking up the price every other year or so. Then I switched to Spectrum internet, which plays the same game with jacking prices every so often, but the service where I live is so much better than AT&T's for some reason, I felt better about the switch. Now here's the kicker, with Spectrum internet, you can get Spectrum Mobile, and it's a heck of a lot less money than Verizon, who I've been using for 15+ years. In fact it's half the price of Verizon - really! There's no difference in mobile service whatsoever. I've come to find out Spectrum Mobile uses Verizon's network. You might ask, how can this be? It's because Spectrum Mobile allows Verizon to use their network where Verizon has no service. This seems to be one of the best kept secrets around. I'm thinking I might take a position in this stock. Anyway, I couldn't be happier..."
If charter acquired VIAC they could combine with Spectrum originals and build on streaming business with VIAC which be a huge revenue and profit builder giving them full control of a vast content for streaming .
"Many ""streamers"" are up today: $AMC, $VIAC, $DISCA, $LGF-A, $CHTR, $NFLX, $CMCSA and don't forget good ol' $ROKU"
"Anyone who knows how to do financial analysis can tell CHTR is still a cheap stock at these levels. PE of 40 by itself would indicate it is expensive, but when you factor in a long term growth rate of 33 percent all of a sudden the idea it is expensive goes out the window. I see massive upside still for CHTR. This is growth at a reasonable price folks."
"Wow, they just increase customer bills by 8% a month and don't even tell you. Nice biz plan!"
Got three harassing sales calls from Spectrum today. What is wrong with this company?
