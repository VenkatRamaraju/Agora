why chtr borrows from the market several times a year to buy back shares if they have such good fcf?
Will VZ buy CHTR? Once this hits $700 look for someone to come in and take the keys over at CHTR possible Alltice??
Will CHTR ever pay a dividend?
Charter should be have more attention then all the FAANG stocks. The rocket is about to take off
need to start paying a dividend

Why would Charter accept a buyout? Whatever premium they’d get today would be far less than the stock will be worth 3-5 years from now.
"Back in the day, I use to make my own UPS. I would put four twelve volt batteries hooked together with 2 12 volt trickle solar panels that you can buy in any hardware store. If the power were to go out in storms I would put just my necessary computer on with a 12 volt 110 power inverter. It would last for a day before needing recharged. And, when the power came back on the solar would slowly recharge the batteries."
OK now we know why CHTR is now big from last week and getting crushed this week. If Malone is no longer getting a vote that might have an impact. Maybe some insider knowledge on that or possible bad earnings coming out next Tuesday. Sorry to sound negative though we are heading back up. For the record I am long. Good luck to us longs hopefully I am wrong would love to be.

"ATTENTION MARKETING - Did you know that your policies prohibit a NEW CUSTOMER from ordering service while someone else still lives in the house they are buying? Yes, its true. This causes only one thing. Do you know what that is? Its AT&T."
$540 a share offer ... LMAO look at it now
"Wow, they just increase customer bills by 8% a month and don't even tell you. Nice biz plan!"
"buy Altice already , it's a fire sale now!"
"Kevin is correct that Charter should buy VIAC. VIAC would want at least $75/share , but totally worth it."
"CHTR is a strong, strong buy. Broadbanding and connectivity and speed are becoming increasingly important as times go on, and with stocks like ZM promoting virtual chat CHTR will be big in that area too. Say what you want about it's customer service, the simple fact is this stock has both a big cash position on its balance sheet, huge free cash flow, and more important a 6 percent free cash flow yield and a 33 percent long term growth rate. 6 percent FCF yield tells us that even at these levels the stock is cheap. I fully expect CHTR to trade at $1000 in a few years and I believe the recent pullback is an opportunity to get involved. Bottom line, I've only discovered a handful of stocks over the years with both a big FCF yield and a large earnings growth rate. This name is a golden nugget amidst a sea of rocks."

Got three harassing sales calls from Spectrum today. What is wrong with this company?
Somewhere I read Charter will need to initiate a deal before whats ahead
Still blows my mind people are willing to short the largest TV/internet provider in the US. This will continue to rise for the next 15 years
Charter has a very poor sourcing organization making it difficult to keep costs under control-hence rate increases and unhappy customers. Time for some reorganization and new leadership folks.
Charter Communications reached an all time high at 563.74
"I keep trying to tell you guys, buying this stock is a layup.Hint: You can’t focus on EPS. First realize that EBITDA and free cash flow are more important. Then look at where free cash flow is being spent now and ask yourself if that’s likely to continue."
I think Bernstein's downgrade today is the wrong call. CHTR is one of the best-managed companies in my portfolio and generates tremendous free cash flow. The best way for CHTR customers to feel good about the price increases that will inevitably happen every year with inflation is to buy the stock.
I should have traded into QCOM none of this would have happened

"Editor writing in for Paul Gardner Allen Drones with blades are going to be a thing of the past. First, to make simple, if you have a flywheel spinning at high RPMs it becomes very difficult to turn though it will go forward and backward. Add another flywheel spinning close together in the opposite direction at the same RPMs. The flywheels spinning in opposite directions can be moved forward and backward easily. However, when one flywheel is slowed down against the other it will be easier to turn in that direction. Drones these days are usually quite small and are very lightweight. Consider just for example, the flywheels spinning are made of lightweight plastic the size of CD's. Now consider a very lightweight shell over the spinning discs sort of like a very small UFO more flat on two sides. Now, to make it simple again, large or small depending on the design can be..I 'm so glad that I found this! I searched Editor for Paul Allen. I know that America has always been innovative and Paul has embraced this crusade in many ways like no other. I actually wrote this to Paul Allen a while back. In my opinion he has the biggest frontiers ahead of him more now than ever before! I'm not sure this is possible but I'll mention it anyway. Think about solar, and for example, UPS boxes that can produce electricity in different ways than ever before kind of like servers with bright white light, and I'll just say it this way just for example, Solar pixels. When Metricom went south I was so happy for him that something good came out of that melee. Looking back, when this happened I wish I would have had the chance to meet him. And, If he has any extra cash I could sure use some....."
Ring Ring ..Hello SoftBank this is Charter are you still willing to give us $540 a share for a merger ?..LMAO
What company was Charter before they became Charter ?
"Regardless of how they may be with their customers, it's undebatable that as an investment CHTR will make you rich. Rarely do I ever pass up an opportunity to make money on an investment unless the ethics are so bad they amount to something like fraud. This company is doing something right. I am not a Spectrum customer, I use AT&T, but I would rather jump off a cliff than park my money in AT&T stock over CHTR."

"I've been short, but will admit the top and bottom line numbers (and cash flow) are impressive. Still losing voice and traditional cable subscribers and increasing revenue through price increases, and using debt to fuel share buybacks.

I sure wish this stock would do a split.

Should of sold at 630....
"Charter communication will lose about 20% of the value before April ,1 this year .The stock is much over priced ."
a #$%$ OF A COMPANY cant watch TV for all of there spectrum ads.
Can’t get spectrum to give me a quote on new service. There is already service on my street. Called numerous times and get jerked around each time. I’m willing to pay to get connected. you’d think they’d want the new business. Anyone know a better phone number to contact them?
Could Charter be included as one of the parties interested in buying VIAC/Viacom . VIAC strong content with increasing momentum in streaming . VIAC strong cash position and low debt with strong & growing profitability .
"Insider just sold 225,000 shares. If Reddit or other savvy investor groups could afford to short at this price, this is prime target to be shorted down to less than $300 in my opinion. Nothing about this company justifies evaluations above $250/share."
This stock will be back around $750 in less than 30 days. Mark my words.
Why are earnings estimate for next year DOUBLE from this year's?? Did they make an acquisition or something to generate all of the extra revenue for 2020? The stock should be $700 to $800 a share if that were true!
You guys need to By LBRDK. It owns 25% of charter. Soros Biggest Holdings( 700mil) Ran by the biggest landowner : John Malone The cable cowboy.Its Charter stock+ ton of 5g tracking/patents. Much better buy the charter
CHTR will be bought out as early as Dec. 1st.
Where can I find what is the date Charter announces earnings ... does anyone know
Having just experienced hopeless customer support I wonder about the future of the company.
I remember that this stock CHTR went bankrupt few years ago. does anybody remember that ? now the new freaking stock is 642 dollars and the old share holders wiped out . But th eoriginal owners are staying intact with a neck the size of those 1000 years old trees . what happened to th eold share holders. did charter ever gave them something in return off course not . That is why I never ever invest in this #$%$ even if it goes to 10000 dollars a shareRemember how to invest . here I said it
"If CHTR could get their hands on Sprint, It would make them the biggest cable/cellular nework with the most 5G spectrum in the world."
Have to say this is one of the worse conference calls I ever heard. These guys offered nothing that would want you to own this stock. Don't look for any appreciation this year. They are reducing their share buy back even when the stock has been nose diving not even thinking if price is attractive they would take advantage. Congrats to the shorts and sorry for us longs. Looks like we are looking for at least 18 months of no appreciate price action. Only a buyout would make a difference and who would want to buy this based on what was said. Looks like further price erosion after the analysts completely have a field day first.
spectrum worst cable service ever. TV remote a real #$%$
"I wouldn’t buy at this high price in this shakey market. I think it will go back down to 735 at the very least,"
CHTR is down -7.72% to 275.14
Either there are buyout rumors or there is a consensus that earnings in 10 days are going to be a blowout. That's why the stock is popping.
"A good way to judge a company is how they make things write when they do wrong.Yesterday, I was victimized by Spectrum, a company where I have been a customer since 1995. Additionally, my wife lost 12 hours of emails, an entire day of time she planned to work on a project requiring emails, I lost a movie we were streaming in mid-stream, and we now have to deal with a technician coming to our house tomorrow. Of the 8 different people I spoke with at Spectrum, all said I was entitled to significant compensation, but my offer is $6?????At 10AM on 8/9/20, I got an email saying there was a service appointment scheduled for my address that day at 2pm, and asked me how it went. Since I cannot predict the future and the account number showing was not mine, I called Spectrum. That is when my Sunday was ruined: I learned that someone at Spectrum had unilaterally decided to assign me to a new account number due to a “typo” in the physical address on my account. As a result of this, my TV shut down in the middle of a movie (all boxes had to be rebooted), my internet crashed and then slowed, and finally and most importantly, my wife lost her emails for 8 hours as even her webmail said she did not exist. Oh, and I was told around 5PM that a termination had put on my account and would be shut down.Trying to clear up this problem that we had nothing to do with took until 10PM, 8 different people, and finally an escalation to a supervisor. Turns out, nobody knows WHY this was done, and my email is still running 33% slower than it is supposed to. If Spectrum thinks losing your emails for a day, cutting off your service, forcing you to miss a project deadline, and inconveniencing you for over 12 hours and counting is worth only $6, what does that say about how the company is managed?"
"I had AT&T internet for the last 10 years, and really got tired of them jacking up the price every other year or so. Then I switched to Spectrum internet, which plays the same game with jacking prices every so often, but the service where I live is so much better than AT&T's for some reason, I felt better about the switch. Now here's the kicker, with Spectrum internet, you can get Spectrum Mobile, and it's a heck of a lot less money than Verizon, who I've been using for 15+ years. In fact it's half the price of Verizon - really! There's no difference in mobile service whatsoever. I've come to find out Spectrum Mobile uses Verizon's network. You might ask, how can this be? It's because Spectrum Mobile allows Verizon to use their network where Verizon has no service. This seems to be one of the best kept secrets around. I'm thinking I might take a position in this stock. Anyway, I couldn't be happier..."

"I said this before, and I'll say this again. Every time I think that I should sell this stock (which I got by way of Time Warner), it jumps. I just guess I'm still going to ride it.And I have my doubts - why isn't wireless, particularly 5G, going to replace this. Why isn't there some other cheaper competitor. Isn't there a time where there aren't any way to grow income?But, for the time being, I'm pleased that I have a nice amount of shares."
The price of CHTR is up an impressive 192% over the last five years. It's also up 13% in about a month.How is Charter forecast to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 26 analysts? Analysis forecasts 18.7% annual earnings growth. So far so good.
"Anyone who knows how to do financial analysis can tell CHTR is still a cheap stock at these levels. PE of 40 by itself would indicate it is expensive, but when you factor in a long term growth rate of 33 percent all of a sudden the idea it is expensive goes out the window. I see massive upside still for CHTR. This is growth at a reasonable price folks."
"I'm a Certified Arborist that when working and doing my best in the peak of my career I ran a great tree service that had annual sales of 1.2 million a year. I loved my job and I was so happy! I had 10 faithful long term employees working as a team I was so proud of. Most of my employees came to work here from Mexico obtaining work Visas to pick crops here on the Central Coast of California. After working with mostly Hispanics over the years since I was 17 I've become bilingual. Most of my employees obtained their greencards while working here and 2 have studied and passed the test to become American Citizens and are so proud. They are able to live and work the American dream buying homes and raising their children in a good environment. And, I've always tried to give my employees a good safe working environment. My secret to having long term employees is I never get mad at them. We all make mistakes at times but we can always learn from them. Also, I pay them well because I can't train unskilled employee turnover which in my industry could prove fatal or lead to serious accidents. My first employee has worked here 28 years and has only missed 1 day of work in all that time. We call him Papa for short. He has raised 4 kids here and is now a grandpa. Also, what's cool is, one of my long term employees raised a family here and his son has grown up and has decided to work here as wrell. He's such an asset being bilingual and able to talk to clients. He's also learning to become a Certified Arborist. In short, being safe, we all work together towards a common goal living the American dream. A decade ago I tried to invest into Metricom funded by Paul Allen and Worldcom hoping I could start saving and retire me and my employees together. All for one and one for all. We lost our money because CEO Bernie Ebbers was found to be cooking the books and went to jail. I had always admired Paul Allen as a good investor so I thought he knew what he was doing. Metricom going under wasn't Paul's fault. Anyway, President Trump should read this post before spending government money building an unnecessary border wall. Hispanics with working visas come here for a better life usually picking crops sending back money to Mexico."

Why the U-turn by Wells Fargo on this stock? Who knows?
"Care less with their earnings are, I work for the company. The reason they make so much in revenue and bring home hardly any in earnings is because of the bloated software systems and slow Internet for their locations to provide customer service. They should reward the loyal customers and employees with lower rates rather than overcharging their loyal customers and giving peanuts to the employees and giving benefit to new customers. If they could Maintain their own customer base and grow new business, that would be wise, but since they don’t know how to do that, their days are numbered.￼￼￼"
"This is my new favorite short candidate. They are using debt to buy back stock and are priced to perfection. People will continue to cut the cord faster with Disney+, HBO Max, and NBC Peacock coming and Netflix's domination continues. Competition is coming for them in internet with Verizon 5g and others getting into the game. And they are trying to get into/expand mobile which may be the dumbest thing the company can do with the competition and costs involved. I've sold some January 2021 calls and purchased some puts as well."

Buying the dip. Below 600 is a bargain. These next few weeks are going to be turbulent for the market due to politics. But the dust will settle soon and CHTR will return to 650. Sit tight longs and add to your positions.

"Simply put, lift can be obtained with air forced down in the opposite direction using air instead of flywheels but the same principle. Simply put, this design would be able to lift a heavier payload and go up down and all around without wings."
Their Spectrum holdings is an absolute disaster. Need to spin it off and get whatever they can for it. Th service is terrible!
Why is the one year target at 0.50?
A fight is going on between CHTR and Softbank. Softbank now has %5 of the shares and slowly sells them to keep the stock price in 300-305 range. In retaliation CHTR uses stock buyback to prevent the price falling too much. I think this will go on until the next stock holders meeting where they will try to change the top management and the board members who are against the merger.

Short it
Anybody know why this dropped 16 points this week? Would think maybe somebody would kick the tires on this one now that CMCSA is out of the FOX bidding. Maybe a wait till earnings come out? I took NFLX slower sub numbers to be a positive for CHTR. Maybe the lost subs will slow down now that they are offering higher speeds. We can only hope. Good luck to us longs.

"I was once short and hating Charter like many of you, on the minus side they have little profit and still make a huge part of their revenue from cable, but why I can’t short it now is that they have a monopoly in many locations on internet with much more growth in sight"
CHTR’s 51 percent earnings growth rate makes me still extremely bullish on this company’s future.

"How this all started and how I lost everything.I use to watch stocks in the newspaper back when the newspapers still listed stocks in the business section. I would follow Microsoft stock among others and realized that Microsoft was going up and doing well over time. It reminded me of an economics class I took in high school where we would pick a stock and follow it eventually reporting why it was chosen and how well it did? However, we didn’t cover how to short a stock. At that time, as an Arborist, I was thinking of my wife Mary who is 17 years older than I and, again, especially of her as well as what I could do for my ten hard working long-term employees that after getting too old to work paycheck to paycheck climbing trees for a living all the while owning homes to raise their families deserve to have me on their side so they wouldn’t lose everything after my retirement and nowhere to turn too? I knew I wouldn’t want that on my conscience. I began to realize we needed to start investing our money to be comfortable in retirement while we still had time on our side. I realized then, that we could buy and sell stocks online so I picked Charles Schwab as my investment broker and proceeded to put my savings in an account there. After reading online wondering what to invest in I learned about upcoming IPO’s? I found that Metricom was going to be funded by Paul Allen and Worldcom. So, thinking that Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen was investing in the new IPO, I made my first investment thinking that going mobile would be really cool, and I would love to use it for me and my company. I invested and doubled my money in a few days riding the stock up after the new IPO was released to trade settling up to 110 dollars per share! After reading further, before Metricom started to decline, I ran across Qualcomm after a friend referred it to me as a good stock. I read about it for a few days and found that it appeared to be going up. So, after getting offline for the evening, I walked into the living room and told my wife that we should trade out of Metricom and trade into Qualcomm the next morning when the stock market opened. She seemed a little disinterested not really knowing what she should do or say to help. Then, I told myself that no matter what I did, Mary and I would trade into Qualcomm in the morning when the markets opened! I would get to the office by six thirty in the morning to start my day outlining crew orientation getting ready for my employees who started their day at seven. I got distracted and drove away from my office running late. After driving for a few blocks, I stopped at the side of the road and realized I didn’t trade like I told myself I would. I thought that I should go back to the office and trade. Like I said, I was running late getting to the men’s jobs in that morning to help make sure they knew what to do. I was caught in a hurry and made the choice not to go back and trade. Parked for ten seconds, I figured and decided that Metricom had to be a good stock, being funded by Paul Allen. BIG mistake! How was I supposed to know that if I had traded into Qualcomm that I would have made three point five million dollars getting lucky! Mary, my employees and I would hope to have enough to be well on our way towards a good retirement goal for all of us! I still wish I had traded that morning like I had told myself I would. However, looking back, if I had traded into Qualcomm like I told myself I would, things would be very different. Not only for me, but for Paul Allen and no one would have been the wiser. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t wish that I made different investment choices, thinking back about it..over..and over! Now, and after learning what I know now, and what I knew then, I made the wrong choice that morning running late to work betting my luck in Metricom, again, thinking Paul Allen knew what he was doing. At the time, I was trying to get as far away from poverty as possible. Again, I felt and hoped that I would have been able to retire my employees right alongside of me and my wife Mary? My ten employees are a very well-paid special group of men working together in a hazardous environment day in and day out without injury. So, as you see, our bond is real tight and it would be cruel of me not to think about them? For example, my first employee has been working with me for 28 years missing only 1 day of work in all that time! I would find it hard and cruel to just say goodbye and retire out on my own! Again, my employees don’t study stocks all the while working raising families and paying off their mortgages living the American dream. Nobody cares when your down and out and on the streets after working hard for years and have nothing to show for it, and nowhere to go. What I didn’t know then, when I invested in Metricom, is that Worldcom would go bankrupt! Paul Allen owned the majority shares in Metricom and owned a"
I am so glad that they opened Las Vegas casinos today. All the gamblers were on stock market lately.
"This stock has been on a nice run. Is there a buyout offer in the wings? About 18 months ago, there was some real talk. Then they entered into a deal that required them to put off any buyout for one full year. That has past. That's why I ask."
"Many ""streamers"" are up today: $AMC, $VIAC, $DISCA, $LGF-A, $CHTR, $NFLX, $CMCSA and don't forget good ol' $ROKU"
Very oversold at 600. CHTR and GME do not deserve the same treatment. CHTR has a competitive advantage and represents the future. GME is a broken story and represents the past. CHTR is not in a bubble like GME. Soon GME will fall back to earth while CHTR takes out 700.
I am recording this for sec and fcc
"Spectrum= scab company, hording billions and raping customers, never buy their service or stock"
"We operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.$CHTR Charter Communications Annual Report https://sec.report/Document/0001091667-19-000029/#sA3775CFA15BF5D2C920D076FCE22D6C6"

"Charter needs to remove downed lines in New Fairfield, CT ASAP. Lines are interfering with ability of school buses to drive safely! Please restore service promptly as well - customer service on phone has been less than responsive."
Basically this stock has been going north forever in the face of cord cutting. Not sure why and maybe someone can explain. I realize that broadband is at the core of the business model.
"Spectrum is pretty shady. I just quit and there is no refund of the unused month. Reasons I left are below.Too expensive. Cost rose from $30/mo five years ago with TimeWarner to $75/mo now with Spectrum. This frog is jumping before the water boils. No increase in speed or change in service.VOIP service (not Spectrum) had one way audio on their network but works fine on other networks. Trying to push people to their VOIP?Never credits for out of service days. Was out of service for two days in March, should have been $2.42 per day, but nothing. There have been others.Called too often to upsell. Shouldn't them being told ""I only watch TV over the antenna"" 20 times be enough to stop?Karma will catch them soon. New competition is coming from Verizon, T-Mobile and Starlink. I wish them little luck."

"Bought in again today big time. Wish I would waited until just before close. :/However, this is slightly oversold here."
"What a joke this is. Great earnings, revenue up, EPS up.Yet down 5%, because it fell short of Wall Street's subscriber growth target. Wall Street knows the target is ridiculous, but they don't care, since they are shorting all cable stocks. Manipulation at its finest. Only way to stay immune to these kind of short attacks is to not use leverage and hold till they eventually decide enough is enough and cover."
It will be over 300 in not much time. Students are moving back in yet. Charter is still expanding as well.
Way overpriced - should be a $200-$250 stock. Highly over-inflated. If there is ever a real correction this should take a serious nose-dive.
Time to check in with my thesis. A year ago I posted “FCF will reach $10 billion by 2025. Free cash flow will double to $6 billion by 2023.” CHTR is currently generating $5.5B FCF. We’re ahead of schedule.I’ve heard every ridiculous bear case under the sun on this board. 5G! Cord cutting (LOL)! Bad customer service! Bloated software! Cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria!Sometimes you just have to keep it simple. This is a near monopoly with enormous barriers to entry. CHTR is going to gush cash as the TWC integration and upgrade cycle comes to a close.
I'm get those put options ready for this puppy
This is why vz has to be fined for 10s of billions
It's worth billions....
One day the are going to pay for propping the stock with buyback using all their cash and raising debt.
You’d think that shorts would be asking themselves “what did I get wrong about CHTR?” but they won’t. This company is a rock solid defensive name with plenty of upside left.
I believe charter will fall big time they're choking my speed down in the 20 mbps range and try to report you hit a brick wall. i'm getting fed up with their lies and run around
"it beats not much, only a very small partial of revenue compared with 01/31/19, so expected only $440.00 is fair value...also it's at peak point currently... So future guidance is not optimistic since it missed 3 times in last 4 quarters, so future most likely it will miss again in next quarter....I would definitely sell now due to its overbought and stock market future will go into a highly correction territory again like last Christmas 12/24/2018..."
When is the buyout?
CHTR reached a new 52 Week Low at 275.14
"Will be 1,000 a share by March next year"
"This is a YUGE overreaction. Of course subscribers are down - this represents a shift from traditional TV service to streaming. Note Internet customers are up - we are converting customers to streaming, not losing them."
