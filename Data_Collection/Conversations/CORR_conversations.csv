oil about to cross $50!!
"If Pindale is so worthless, how is it we didn't even know it was for sale and they already secured a buyer? Who got paid on this deal?Anybody else happy about management looking forward to spending our last 100 million?"
"Hopefully everyone here added or at least held during CORR's swoon under $5. The SP recovery is on the way, at this rate we'll be back over $10 in short order. My purchases started at $33 and ended at $3.65, now with a cost basis of $13.25 on the whole position, I am feeling much better about CORR and even a divvy at half of the past level (i.e. $1.50/yr vs $3.00/yr) I will be getting a yield of over 11% when the dividends return (assumptions notwithstanding). CORR has been my only loser (so far) from my spring/summer COVID REIT load up, so its time for CORR to giddy up."
"I have owned both common and pref'd shares since May 2017 in two accounts, my regular brokerage account and my wife's IRA account. Made some very decent Capital gain and dividend money selling off all the Preferred's lately at $21.59, I bought some cheap at $14.27 and had some just below the $25 par since the beginning of this investment. I figure it was time to sell, swapping for a higher dividend gain. Still own the common shares, dumped 100 shares out of a Roth IRA at a small profit from dividend return. This has been an investment gain over the long run, but still holding at a loss on the remaining common shares. The COVID VIRUS market mess is the entire reason, some of their holdings were financially weak and could not survive the payout. It is hard to find viable deals that fit their structure, as many are good assets, with weak financial strength. My only choice is to hold the common shares and wait for a $12 to $14 price to break almost even."
"""equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $50.00 per share of the Company's common stock."" Still 10% until the bonds are 'in-the-money'"
"So I mailed Investor Relations at CorEnergy and was surprised to get a mail back within the hour. I complained about lack of communication (even though I understand there are some things they cant say), while the stock continues to tank and what about shareholders? Someone called Matt Kreps said, he understands and that was it. No apology, no commitment to pass the mail up the chain of command, nothing. I suggest all shareholders mail them as I did until something happens."
Vanguard new investor ??
Seems like this follows the price of oil.
Is the $1 forecast from Stifel overly generous ???
This looks like a bargain
"I’m going to be honest with you all. I’ve held over 1k shares of this stock since around June of 2020 at an average price of $8.66. Although I have not lost any money, I’ve also have not made any money. Which means my money is better off in another growth stock. If you want to make gains, go into stocks that are highly speculated by the culture. Meaning not everyone is fond by oil and gas anymore, EV and clean energy is the future regardless of what is economically beneficial. So heres my perspective: even if you guys don’t lose money, you are losing opportunities to make money and that is fairly equivalent. You all are in charge of your money and can make your own decisions, but at this point holding is just being fanatically inclined to the company. Lets be realistic here, the only bulls are those who are down thousands."

"Very good news about the crimson deal, we should be on the steady up and up!"
"Anyone here? I take a look at that stock , but I didn’t like how low is the volume. Any news soon for CORR???"
"WTI Crude Oil is now at $41.50 per barrel. I’d have to believe Cox Oil is looking to restart their Gulf wells and get back to production. They will need to work out a plan with CORR as back rent contractually accrues, meaning they owe millions of dollars to CORR and us shareholders. I would think an araingement to extend lease with a portion payment can be worked out. But more importantly, Cox Oil starts making future rent payments. Based upon this occurring, I see a $25.00 stock price and the dividend of at least $1.00 per share."
Does anyone know why this stock isn’t moving with all the gains on oil?
"well come on, turn around!"
Why was CORR in the 40s just before covid? Can it get back to $20-30.
Is this the start to the short squeeze?
would be nice to get an update soon on leases
why did this jump so much? must be good earnings
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.10% to 4.62
All they have to do is increase their dividend back to normal and their stock will rocket back to normal.
"Natural Gas prices are approaching $3 going out to next winter. Near term months are low, but that is to be expected with summer months. No doubt Ultra can be profitable after BK with $2B of debt off the books and natural gas prices nearing $3/Mbtu. In other words CORR will have a financially sound tenant again with dependable rent. I'm surprised CORR hasn't gone up more on this news? Maybe the market doesn't realize this yet....https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html"
"CEO is suffering here as well, look at all the buys in the $30's...no sells. Must be as frustrated as the rest of us with how the market is pricing the stock.https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1107140.htm"
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 5.57% to 5.09
Anyone thinking of voting against the Crimson deal?
we are aiming for the 1's and 2's. Im in at 42.
I don't see any red flags. And the price is great but maybe getting even better.
"I like the way CORR stock is acting. It’s telling me oil prices are going up. January futures price is over $45, vaccine is on the way and we will be over Covid in 6 months after everyone is vaccinated and we can get back to normal. Plus company issues will be settled very soon."
"Anyone listen to the CC? This was the best call, information and confidence-wise, I have heard from CORR in many quarters. The acquisition front seems very promising, especially if they get into the renewable energy distribution area, but they also made a strong case for hydrocarbons (something I agree with as I've also been buying XOM here). I appreciate the due diligence they are performing and I do understand that they have to be pretty quiet on the GIGS asset, since they are trying to work something out without pulling the litigation trigger. Next 3-6 months could be very interesting for CORR and we may look back in a year or so and wonder how it ever got this low, IMHO."
"Highly manipulated stock ... or rather ""controlled"""
"Where you at Tom? I listened to the whole investor call, it seems like management has decided to reduce their risk and increase it's market share. P66 in California is closing a refinery which will add more market share to CORR, too. This deal is robust and also helps to rectify the GIGS/ COX lease nonpayment issue. Not sure why the stock went up 11% then fell to below %5 at the moment. You're words of wisdom are welcome!"
"Q1 Results:CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust (CORR -9.8%) plunges after preliminary Q1 operating results reveal $15.7M in lease revenue and $5.2M in transportation and distribution revenue.But CorEnergy recorded a $30.1M writeoff for deferred rent receivable related to the Grand Isle Lease agreement, resulting in a net loss of $9.1M for the quarter.The company recognized a ~$140M loss on impairment of leased property related to the Grand Isle Gathering System, resulting in a quarterly net loss attributable to stockholders of $164.3M, or $12.04/share.An agreement in principle was reached to sell the Pinedale LGS asset to UPL for $18M, with proceeds from the sale plus any cash remaining at Pinedale LP expected to satisfy any remaining debt at Pinedale LGS and thus eliminate any debt repayment obligations from CorEnergy.CorEnergy says Q2 results will reflect a ~$147M charge for the Pinedale LGS, which could be partially offset by any reduction of debt owed."

There’s a lot of short sellers on this stock. If it pops a dollar it will really start to run when the squeeze hits
"From Oilprice website.U.S. Pipeline Operators Offer Special Deals To Oil Producers:Some of the largest pipeline operators in the U.S. have started to offer sweeter deals for crude oil shipment to producers as the midstream sector vies to curb its losses and keep its relevance amid the oil demand and production decline. Pipeline companies, including Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Product Partners, and Energy Transfer, have cut shipment rates in contract negotiations or have offered more advantageous rates in current contracts to U.S. oil producers to keep their customers amid a pipeline overcapacity and an overall slump in oil demand and oil production in the United States, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Magellan Midstream Partners has even offered to its customers the option to ship crude on its pipeline only when market conditions are favorable, according to Reuters. This approach differs from the typical take-or-pay contracts between an upstream and a midstream company for moving oil out of a production center. Caught between production curtailments and bankruptcies in the U.S. shale patch and reduced demand for fuels from the downstream, pipeline operators have seen pipeline utilization rates and their revenues fall this year. After the oil price crash in March, pipeline infrastructure companies started to announce deferrals of final investment decisions and start-up dates for planned oil and gas pipelines, especially in the Permian, which suddenly found itself with a overbuild of capacity as production and consumption of oil struggled to recover from the pandemic-driven crisis.The latest announcement of a canceled oil pipeline came from Enterprise Products Partners, which said earlier this month that it was scrapping the 450,000 barrels per day Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline project.Current pipeline capacity in the Permian is exceeding production so much that in a year or two, when pipelines currently under construction are completed, Permian producers could find themselves using just half of the available takeaway infrastructure, according to analysts."
"Now that oil is approaching $40, Cox Oil should be reopening their wells. I have been saying in next 60 days, but I think it will be getting there soon. Cox represents 46% of revenue. When that happens we will see CORR at $25."
"It will be interesting to see if we get a bump from the 3 investor conferences this week for CORR, last one is Friday. I checked out the presentation from IR, nothing too new, other than a mention that GIGS litigation is on hold pending settlement negotiations. With $30M in past due rent, any resolution would be favorable to CORR's stock price, which seems to be pricing in the end of that asset. LOL!"
The stock is now trading lower than the price it hit when the market crashed back in March....painful!
Have we reached peak pessimism? I think we're close. Looking to start a meaningful position.
9 of the last 10 trading day CORR down. impressive
Preferred down 22% but common only down 12%. Go figure.
Any news about Cox payment? Crude Oil prices seem to be enough high.
This is my guess: WTI price went below $40 and threatened Cox Oils profitablity. Will they stop their wells again?

"Not sure why CORR is getting so crushed (virus and market meltdown notwithstanding), but I'm buying here."
"Almost 8.5% of the float is sold short (1.15M shares as of Jan 15th). Given the Crimson news, there is little reason to be short anymore as CORR is clearly solvent and profitable with the Crimson acquisition. Deal valued at $350M generating $50M+ in EBITDA, with CORR also having the profitable MoGas and Omega assets. Crimson's clients are investment grade with regulated revenue to CORR. Seems like this takes a huge amount of risk out of CORR's shares and adds a lot of value, smaller divvy notwithstanding. Looking forward to the call tomorrow."
Im riding this all the way back to Q1 of 2020 baby
"being a small business, looks like they're doing their best in the tough market. I need a tons of patience on this one."
CORR is a great company. I am going to double what I have today.
Can anyone answer this question ? Why would any company merge with CORR based on CORR’s operating record.Anybody?
"Interesting option movement.....this week over 160,000 shares bought on Dec 2019 call options at a $50 strike price."

Where is the Stifel analyst?It might be time to change his recommendation !
"Wow, quickest call ever, exactly nine minutes. I didn't hear anything new, but there is some hope that Cox begins pumping oil again since prices have stabilized and CORR is pursuing their back rent in Court. David said they will be looking to an acquisition with the $100M+ they have to ""rebuild"" the business. No Q&A. Ho-hum CC......"
I've had my eye on this stock for a while now. The upside potential and security of a REIT made this a great value buy. Maybe a but of a hedge but it's paying off handsomely now
"Since the stock has been making more and more lows, the comments have dwindled to a few.Guess the ""retail"" investor has exited this name for now, until it's back to $20 and paying a hefty 10%+ dividend again.Who's still invested in this company? I'm in with a avg price of $7.75, so down a bit but looking longer term"
"Well whatever the solution, they better get it signed and fast! Pretty common knowledge on the street that the oil bull market is a dinosaur. Nat gas will be around forever but oil will eventually go away...eventually it will give in to solar, lithium, and fusion. Would be nice for them to diversify into solar as a start."
great price to average down with. CORR on fire sale!!!
Over $17.00 on no news! Going to be a fast ride up to $25.00
We get diluted. We pay cash. We give up an asset that owes us cash (in a rising market). We take on debt. What we get in return is a piddily dividend and 1800 miles of headache - California regulated pipelines. Pipelines that carry the same fuel California wants to regulate out of existence in the near future.What kind of deal is that?
"There are 13.65 million ordinary shares in circulation.Yesterday there were 4 purchases of 100,000 shares = 400,000 shares (~3% of all shares)Total trading volume ~ 12% of all sharesI think a bad forecast merges individual investors, and funds are averaged, most likely this is manipulation.I looked at several early forecasts from Stiefel ... thePrice falls after the negative forecast is released, there are several averaging, then growth.There is a chance of good growth if a deal is concluded in December for a new asset."
"Any long timers if earning is this Wednesday or next Wednesday? If next week, it’s going to be chaotic."
How did Schulte get re-elected after what he has done to CORR ? Never reported the vote. This isn’t social promotion like school if you didn’t do well
someone or some hedgie bought a 15k block at yesterday's close
I took a serious bath on this stock. Fortunately I sold half of my holdings at the top but am still hanging on to 2000 shares. The management team are not doing their job by staying dark on progress with acquisitions. We dont need details but should have some news on progress to help buoy up the share price.....
Based on remaining assets to invest. You can forget about a $3.00 ever coming back. Maybe $1.50 might make more sense.I hope they have insurance against business interruption from hurricanes. This price looks very cheap
"Lower than 2008 crash, just insane. Interest coverage ratio is 6x. P/FFO is around $2. I've added to my preferreds here and I'm ready to buy the common, but don't want to buy and then have it drop another 50%. Will wait for more confirmation on the market settling down."
CorEnergy Infr Trust is up 34.24% to 16.27
"Anyone loading up here? I’m thinking the earnings report will be better than expected. I’m very curious what they are doing with the money from the pinedale debacle, have they announced any acquisitions? Any thoughts?"
what happened Friday? stocks took a dive. can't find a reason.
"According to my calculation, this stock is worth 16.81 without multiplier ... however, yahoo finance shows it to be overvalued ... what am I missing??"
"Unless there is another shoe to drop, this deal is not compelling. GIGS and Cox debt given away, more debt and more stock issued for pipelines in a state which services refineries specific to their needs while California is accelerating the move to get rid of the ICE. Oh, and oil pipelines in a state known for wildfires and awaiting a major earthquake event. My holdings here are 20k underwater and getting deeper by the minute..."
Top U.S. fuel pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline has shut its entire network after a cyber attack that industry sources said was caused by ransomware software. This could be an opportunity for CORR
Crimson's California Pipeline is really a good asset with good returns and now Corr is more diversified. Most probably it will return its dividend back in a couple of quaters.
Ex Div date has past....waiting to see what the price action will do today 8/16/19. Volume and direction.
CORR reminds me of Sprint in 1990s when it dropped from $70s to $7 and never went back up. Wish it doesn't happen the same here.
acquisition is official!!! YAY or NAY??
CORR-PA is down 19.26% to 14.30
"up 17% premarket today, GREAT JOB STIFEL!!!! ThANK YOU FOR CALLING THE BOTTOM"
Looks like something is cooking...Price is running up rapidly these past few days (~25%). Some people are in the know...
"I bought my first 1000 shares at $36 about 3.5 years ago when it paid an 8% dividend. I added shares at $21 ,$18,and finally another 2000 shares at $12 for a total of a little over 5000 shares. With Cox back on line i feel over feel over the next year or two the stock should be able to get back at least to $30 and pay a decent dividend. Remember before the virus we were as high as $49 per share.Good luck to long term holders."
something must be up. price keeps rising.
"That thud you heard was the sound of the shorts getting pounded into dust. It will be very interesting to see the next updated short % of float which had been over 10% for a good long time, now under 4%. GLTA"
"Very bullish price action, reasonably high volume lately"
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 7.00% to 4.89
"Since Ultra will be paying rent during BK (just like in 2016), CORR has only lost rent from Cox, and presumably can return the divvy back to 50% of what it paid before, instead of 75 cents CORR should be able to pay 37.5 cents per Qtr, or $1.50 per year, which is almost a 15% yield here. Once Cox gets back to pumping and thus paying rent, CORR should be paying it's full divvy again. Just added the final batch to my position this morning."
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.60% to 4.81
"T-minus 30 days on announcement of a new deal. If Vegas had odds on this, I think it would be 65%. It was higher after the conference call and will probably go down by about 2% per day from here. C'mon guys put something on the table that shows your enterprise has a viable path forward."
anyone have any have idea weather to keep holding or sell ?
Who is selling shares? More informed investors? Before the news about Pinedale was released the stock was falling each day with movements uncorrelated to the oil price; I had a feeling somebody was constantly dumping shares.
"is CORR, more or less, permanently a $ 7- $ 9 stock with a maybe 20 cent dividend ?is there any realistic hope that we could see a $ 1 dividend in the next year or so ?they were sitting on $ 100 million for a "" future "" investment. does anything think they will actually do anything with this ?it seems odd that there has been no insider selling of CORR for the last 5 years, only insider buying was this as much as surprise for them as it has been for us ?any thoughts ? I thought this was a pretty conservative investment, one year ago. $ 3 dividend and $ 40 share priceany thoughts ?"
$13.32 in pre-market. Up +25%
"Lets get CORR down to a dollar, then we all buy CORR."
If CORR management resigned and Crimson management stepped in I think that would help the company and stock.CORR management has run their assets into the ground. Crimson management received equity and I think they would want to protect that
Am I going in wrong path by investing more in this stock?
"Hey REDDIT users: Melvin Capital is short CORR, let's go get 'em! LOL! Seriously, the retail targeting of heavily shorted stocks is like nothing I have seen in my 30 years of investing/trading. Yes, I had GME at $4.30 from last spring, thought I was a genius for selling it at $28 for a 500% gain an look where it is now. Unreal!"
UPDATE!!! The acquisition is coming!! read today's 8-K on CORR's site!!
CORR is on sale at the dollar store
Hit 18 after hours. Its a rocket - 20 tomorrow?
"Hi anyone here. Is it good point to go long at 7,00 or I’m late. I think it’s a still good point to entry."
"where does this stop ? $ 2 ? $ 3 ? I'm in at $ 40, so thats-that. Dreadful management"
shouldn't this be over $15?
Well... this hurts
"The common stock looks like a buy to me, given the price and the cash flows."
here is the Pinedale volumes 2014 - 2019 according tothe 10-K of 2016 & 10-K of 2019:2014 - 184.48 BCF2015 - 261.50 BCF2016 - 256.88 BCF2017 - 256.69 BCF2018 - 264.78 BCF2019 - 237.85 BCFI think it will be hard for Ultra to reduce the costs of gathering for large volumes by using a third party system.
"Additionally, we are exchanging CorEnergy’s single-tenant GIGS asset for long-lived critical infrastructure pipeline systems used by a diverse group of investment-grade rated customers"

"Today, management of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) commented on the oil spill that has been reported offshore near Huntington Beach, California, noting that it occurred on a pipeline not owned by the Company. The Company does not own or operate any offshore platforms or pipelines.The Company has historically received barrels transported by the affected pipeline, at an average of approximately 4,600 bpd over the past four months, equating to average monthly revenue of approximately $98,000 during that time (including the associated pipeline loss allowance). Currently, this production has been shut in and the timing of its return is uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, we do not expect this event to affect our common dividend outlook, which is subject to board approval."
Thats torn it. Another one way conference call tomorrow and no news on GIGS or new assets. What a shower. Time for a management change...
"next week ""should"" be earnings, it's either ""now or never"" on the acquisition announcement.Also, there better be an update on GIGS and Cox Oil..."
"I just read the 8K - if I understand it correctly, Cox had there debt forgiven as part of the deal #$%$ !! I will be selling my remaining stock when the market opens tomorrow. Tis whole deal will attract numerous class action suits and they deserve it."
"I really wanted this deal to be a game changer but it is not. Just more of the short sighted poorly negotiated actions we have seen in the past. The real kicker was the dividend sitting at 20c for an unspecified time. I just sold half of my holdings and will wait another week to see if this turns around. My money went into OKE which in my view is more aligned with the future and has a stunning dividend. I lost a bundle on this stock but have a small profit on the 2000 shares I have left. I do have one question for those of you who are still supporting this deal. If these are such great assets, why did Crimson sell them in the first place !"
"Held my nose and bought my last batch at $5.72. The ""no news"" has this dripping lower, but at some point the Cox issue will be resolved. One way or another and if Cox can't get their oil out without CORR, this is a different situation than Pinedale. Plus, with everyone cutting production and exploration (will XOM be the last shoe to drop?) oil should steady and even rise. Anyhoo, I can sit on this and be patient."
"CORR has now fallen 22 of the last 27 trading days. Amazing management. this is extremely hard to do, unless you are Enron"
Will the dividend eventually return to 0.75 a share? Thoughts??
I wonder what Stifel knows that the Chairman of CORR didn’t discuss. They are sitting on 150 million cash.
Conference starting at 10 am
We got NEWS
35% premarket! Will it fall 30% by 10am???

"damn, last week was ultra bullish for CORR (or so it seemed) and we nearly broke $10 TWICEHowever, price action has retraced backwards 10-12% so we're basing for another big breakout IF we can get the damn GIGS issue resolved + acquisition.At the same time, oil itself is breaking out slowly and could test $55 soon......The stars are aligning.....For anyone who wants a good risk reward play, look into the $10/12.50 call spreads which pay up to 5-6x your call premium. Feb 19 buy $10 call , sell $12.50 call. Net price is about $45-55 but with gains up to $250 per spreadShort term trade for sure, but you get their earnings + acquisition? announcement so its priced into the premiumIf you want to pay a bit more for the March spreads, you can buy the $10 and sell the $15 for ~$100 and upside up to $500"
Loving the follow through on this recent price movement.
Anyone else confused by the price action today? Earnings report was better than expected...
It look like positive CORR news by mid February plus the dividend announcement.
Finally got some solid good news. Tomorrow will be interesting. The entire energy sector has been in fire but CORR hasn’t been
why is stock price not crashing? weird...
"After listening to the call and reviewing the presentation materials, this is definitely a “mixed bag” result for stockholders, depending at what price you own it. CORR has fundamentally changed, they own just 1 of their 3 original assets after 12 months (Omega is a minor 4th asset), after clearly having been burned by the 2 low-grade credit worthy tenants being Ultra and Cox. Management has responded by perhaps overreaching for an exceptionally reliable asset in Crimson. This “exchange” for higher-quality comes at a price in the form of dilution and a much lower than expected dividend. Personally, this is where my disappointment lies. However, CORR’s viability was at stake, (going from $45 to $4 demonstrates this) and no doubt that CORR now has much more stability going forward. No question.Here comes the part about where one owns CORR. I started buying small lots of CORR when it started dropping last Feb/March/April and have shares in the low $30’s $20’s and at $17. After watching it stumble over the summer, I bought bigger lots in October and November and again in early January at prices from $3.55 (Nov) and $5 (Oct) and then $6.65 (Jan). For me, those lower price shares will be worth the patience to hold. It appears I may have been wrong in my assumption that the Crimson contribution to the divvy would be in addition to what they already pay, so a 40 cent divvy may be the max that could be expected in the near term (12-18 months). With a cost basis on my lower shares of $4.25, that is a 9.4% yield and something worth holding for, especially since that may increase over time.For my stranded shares at $17 and above, it is not worth holding CORR for the 40 cent divvy and that diminished capital could be better deployed elsewhere. I am fortunate enough to have some gains already this year, and since BAM will be ultimately buying out my BPYU shares at some point this year as well, I plan to sell those higher priced CORR shares over the next year as an offsetting loss and adding those stranded funds to positions/opportunities elsewhere. My position in CORR will drop by about 40% due to those sales. For stockholders who weren’t able to grab shares at the lower levels, I wouldn’t expect CORR to really rebound in price significantly. $8-$12 is probably a likely range for CORR over the next 12 months, so sadly no rally back to higher levels for other longs and my (eventually formerly) stranded shares. But no question now about solvency and cash flow either, CORR will survive. Mixed bag for sure…."
"Given that UPL has rejected the lease and will stop paying rent to CORR from 7/1, I’m surprised this is trading as well as it is. It’s up significantly from the trading halt where they released that news."
The market is telling me there is too much exotic paper issued to do this deal. Will the managements mesh well. I think If they come back with 1.40 dividend the stock price will be higher and they could issue stock to pay down or pay off these various preferred shares and debt. The market did not react well to this merger. It’s down 30c
I'd buy the company out if had the dough. what's the chance of this company being bought if someone makes an offer?
"From Ultra's release:The Company has secured a commitment for financing of up to $25 million from certain holders of the Company’s first lien term loan, which combined with cash on hand and its normal operating cash flow, is expected to allow Ultra to maintain normal operations and meet ongoing financial commitments throughout the Chapter 11 restructuring period. Additionally, all of the Company’s existing lenders under its first lien RBL credit facility have executed commitment letters to provide exit financing in the form of a revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $100 million and total commitments of $60 million.The Company also expects to pay suppliers and vendors in full under normal terms for goods and services and will continue making royalty and working interest payments when due."
"So... Pinedale was the biggest customer, after all. What a BS.Seeking Alpha: CorEnergy Preferred: 12% Yield While You Wait For Your +70% Capital Gain.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4360735-corenergy-preferred-12-yield-while-you-wait-for-yourplus-70-capital-gain"
"outstanding management. we lose 2 of the 3 major assets, considerable stock dilution, and we take on huge debt. Shrewd, very shrewd. Brilliant. and we get a 20 cent dividend instead of $ 3. Clever"
Management negligence to have two customers providing all of your revenues. How long has this management team been promising new acquisitions and not delivered. One of the worst 10Ks I ever had the misfortune to read. Time for a few changes at the top.
"What a disaster. Selling Pinedale for $18M and taking a $147M loss on the asset?!? Ultra F*%^&@'D CORR hard. So much for critical infrastructure ""investing"". CORR and shareholders just took a bath on Pinedale, we'll never see $40 again IMHO."
"10 of the last 11 trading days CORR is DOWN. pretty cool, huh ?"
There’s absolutely no reason for a drop. I see these guys going up￼
"Math plays on the long side. With 2 tenantsthe probability they both fail to pay the lease is 25%the probability one of the two fails is 50%the probability both resume paying is 25%In other words, there is 75% probability of a positive outcome for shareholders."
Hi there. Can anybody tell in nutshell why is such a panic sale taking place? Will appreciate
1 year ago a $ 3 dividend; now a $ 7 stock. a great management team
Is it close to the bottom yet or will it be heading down to five? Any thoughts?
"Similar pattern to 2016, with Chapter 11, with COVID involved this could likely have a much better result and bring the stock back to the $20’ quicklyhttps://investors.corenergy.reit/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/CorEnergy-Releases-First-Quarter-2016-Results/default.aspx"
I have a few hundred of these at a cost basis of a shade over $15. Thinking of holding as long as they pay a dividend but open to thoughts. Should I hold for another year at least to see if comes back up to $15? Or sell my position by the end of the year for tax harvest and reinvest somewhere else? Any recommendations welcome. Thanks!
Going up AH
down 4 out of 5 trading days this week. not bad. great management. way to go fellas
"Sounds like rent is contractual anyway so if there is a bankruptcy of Cox, Corr should be first in line for back payment"
When do you think this will return to 40$
I'll add at $14
I feel that they may be near some sort of announcement since the stock was at one point up about 13%.
I notice that REIT’s are making new highs in this market but not CORR.
This room used to be so chatty; miss the pals here.Anyone has any idea what's would be the new valuation for this stock and what dividends will be like.
"WTI Crude Oil is now trading at $40.12. Should continue to trade going forward this summer in $40’s. Only a matter of time before Cox Oil reopen their wells. Remember, Cheescake Factory did the same thing by closing their restaurants and stopped paying rent. Same thing with Cox Oil, they will restart and start paying rent. Would have to believe CORR and Cox Oil will come to an agreement on back rent that suits them both. Legally, back rent is due and accrues. Expect to see CORR at $25 when Cox comes back online and reinstate at least 35-40% of dividend."
I don’t think Sprint is comparable to CORR. Sprints system was different from all the other cellphone carriers. CORR JUST MANAGED THEIR OPERATIONS POORLY !!
"Wow, Stifel goes from a sell to a hold with an objective of $ 5 .Welcome aboard"
"This company has $10.13 in cash, and the debt situation is not really a situation at all for CORR. The company could pay down 75% of total debt TODAY, in CASH if they wanted to without even diluting shareholders. So.. insolvency or any catastrophic event like that isn't really ont he table.. so continuing on..PP&E had carrying value of $109 MM on the last Q, and leased property was carried at $389 MM. And prior to COVID, investors were paying about a 65% premium on those assets at a $800 - $900 MM valuation.Even if thsee assets are to trade at a discount right now, which there is an argument for, it seems like we have overshot by a long way. Again.. looking at this in the most pessimistic way even, I can't wrap my head around this company being worth less than $300 MM, and even in a mildly optimistic scenario, closer to $450. Any value guys out there want to chime in?"
"Let's review recent events here:- Oil goes through a period of unprecedented volatility- During the volatility, one of CORR's tenants with a history of filing for CH 11 during volatility files for CH 11 -- 99% chance that lease gets renegotiated down some %age points and is paid at the newer negotiated rate when the company emerges (this has happened with this tenant before in recent history)- Also during that unprecented volatiility, one of CORR's larger tenants.. representing ~40% of revenue, says they need to hold off on payments for a month or two.. WHILE OIL PRICES ARE NEGATIVE... yes, ""sorry we can't afford to pay you right now because the main thing we produce has negative prices"".. pretty reasonable- About 1.5 months after that bigger tenant said they can't make rent in April, Oil went from $14 / barrel in April, to negative prices in May, and is now trading at around $40 in June.. and major stock indicies are making new highs....what do you think is going to happen here?? I was jacked OXY since last Friday, and CORR looks like an even stronger opportunitiy to me now based solely on the math of the sum of the parts. I'm Long."
