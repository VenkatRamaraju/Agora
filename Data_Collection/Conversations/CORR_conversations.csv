this company will go out of business .. that is the surprise they are preparing
CORR-PA is down 15.21% to 11.87
"I just read the 8K - if I understand it correctly, Cox had there debt forgiven as part of the deal #$%$ !! I will be selling my remaining stock when the market opens tomorrow. Tis whole deal will attract numerous class action suits and they deserve it."
Hit 18 after hours. Its a rocket - 20 tomorrow?
"Highly manipulated stock ... or rather ""controlled"""
The stock is worth $20 with Cox Energy now restarting rent payment at GIGS.
Good luck to everyone tomorrow. Unfortunately the market is going down because uncertainties.
"I’m going to be honest with you all. I’ve held over 1k shares of this stock since around June of 2020 at an average price of $8.66. Although I have not lost any money, I’ve also have not made any money. Which means my money is better off in another growth stock. If you want to make gains, go into stocks that are highly speculated by the culture. Meaning not everyone is fond by oil and gas anymore, EV and clean energy is the future regardless of what is economically beneficial. So heres my perspective: even if you guys don’t lose money, you are losing opportunities to make money and that is fairly equivalent. You all are in charge of your money and can make your own decisions, but at this point holding is just being fanatically inclined to the company. Lets be realistic here, the only bulls are those who are down thousands."
CorEnergy Infr Trust is up 9.82% to 4.69
Great forecast and results!!!
CORR-PA reached a 52 Week low at 16.71
No news? Suspicious
What’s happened here is Crimson is now public through CORR. Crimson. Management will eventually control and run CORR. The CORR management failed us.
I have a few hundred of these at a cost basis of a shade over $15. Thinking of holding as long as they pay a dividend but open to thoughts. Should I hold for another year at least to see if comes back up to $15? Or sell my position by the end of the year for tax harvest and reinvest somewhere else? Any recommendations welcome. Thanks!
"WTI Crude Oil is now trading at $40.12. Should continue to trade going forward this summer in $40’s. Only a matter of time before Cox Oil reopen their wells. Remember, Cheescake Factory did the same thing by closing their restaurants and stopped paying rent. Same thing with Cox Oil, they will restart and start paying rent. Would have to believe CORR and Cox Oil will come to an agreement on back rent that suits them both. Legally, back rent is due and accrues. Expect to see CORR at $25 when Cox comes back online and reinstate at least 35-40% of dividend."
"Now that oil is approaching $40, Cox Oil should be reopening their wells. I have been saying in next 60 days, but I think it will be getting there soon. Cox represents 46% of revenue. When that happens we will see CORR at $25."
We knew a divy cut was coming. But to lose your primary source of revenue? This could get very lucrative for attorneys
is CORR going to ever see any money from COX ? are these lines up and running ?

Are CORR new pipelines where the Forrest fires are in California
Check the 8k file dated today re: UPL seeking to reject CORRs lease and moving their production off the CORR system to another they own. All in the hands of the court now.
I don't see any viable acquisition since the entire oil market is in the gutter. Might as well put the company up for sale.
"Sad to see this stock go down like this, Dividends are BS if the stock drops 10% each month"
"If you believe that targeted lockdowns are the maximum going forward, then buy CORR. Oil consumption will only rise from here! People are venturing out more and more and they need things to do.US Govt cannot let this one fail, we need an independent oil supply and the gulf is key."
"Very good news about the crimson deal, we should be on the steady up and up!"
Well we lost our profit from yesterday.
All they have to do is increase their dividend back to normal and their stock will rocket back to normal.
"Well whatever the solution, they better get it signed and fast! Pretty common knowledge on the street that the oil bull market is a dinosaur. Nat gas will be around forever but oil will eventually go away...eventually it will give in to solar, lithium, and fusion. Would be nice for them to diversify into solar as a start."
Am I going in wrong path by investing more in this stock?
I'll add at $14
"Natural Gas prices are approaching $3 going out to next winter. Near term months are low, but that is to be expected with summer months. No doubt Ultra can be profitable after BK with $2B of debt off the books and natural gas prices nearing $3/Mbtu. In other words CORR will have a financially sound tenant again with dependable rent. I'm surprised CORR hasn't gone up more on this news? Maybe the market doesn't realize this yet....https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html"
"Almost 8.5% of the float is sold short (1.15M shares as of Jan 15th). Given the Crimson news, there is little reason to be short anymore as CORR is clearly solvent and profitable with the Crimson acquisition. Deal valued at $350M generating $50M+ in EBITDA, with CORR also having the profitable MoGas and Omega assets. Crimson's clients are investment grade with regulated revenue to CORR. Seems like this takes a huge amount of risk out of CORR's shares and adds a lot of value, smaller divvy notwithstanding. Looking forward to the call tomorrow."
here is the Pinedale volumes 2014 - 2019 according tothe 10-K of 2016 & 10-K of 2019:2014 - 184.48 BCF2015 - 261.50 BCF2016 - 256.88 BCF2017 - 256.69 BCF2018 - 264.78 BCF2019 - 237.85 BCFI think it will be hard for Ultra to reduce the costs of gathering for large volumes by using a third party system.
"UPLC, Ultra Petroleum will restructure their debt and pay their vendors from their press release. They did the same thing back in 2016. This represents 30% of CORR’s income. Cox Oil will reopen their wells soon now that oil is trading over $32.50. CORR should be trading at $18.00-$20.00 on this news of UPLC and oil at $32.50. Ultimately WHEN Cox Oil comes back online not IF, stock will be trading at $35.00 per share. This stock is a Strong Buy and should be purchased at these low prices."

"RBC was issuing their downgrade from UPLs filings from last week apparently.If you want to be annoyed, be annoyed with CORR management who decided NOT to update THEIR shareholders re: UPLs most recent filings. Add to that, what we now know, that Pinedale was supposed to be a ...and I quote...""critical asset they cannot operate without"", which we now know is untrue regardless of the ""beliefs"" or opinions of the company. Cause for dismissal of company officers and possible class action IMHOOnly the courts rulings can salvage their reputations now and even then..... MAYBE ! GLTA from a betrayed shareholder."

CORR reminds me of Sprint in 1990s when it dropped from $70s to $7 and never went back up. Wish it doesn't happen the same here.
"Anyone loading up here? I’m thinking the earnings report will be better than expected. I’m very curious what they are doing with the money from the pinedale debacle, have they announced any acquisitions? Any thoughts?"
Interesting to see CG Carlyle group up 10% last 2 days . They had invested into Crimson a few years ago
is the dividend over ?
"CORR stopped free falling. Wondering who's buying. Anyway, even at $2.25 (if we get that) dividend, it's not as bad. It'd just make it average stock as others I have."
I've had my eye on this stock for a while now. The upside potential and security of a REIT made this a great value buy. Maybe a but of a hedge but it's paying off handsomely now
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 6.32% to 5.72
"Why don't they take that 100 Mil they have in the bank and buy a profitable company (any), then hire a competent manager to run it? Time to diversify imho."

what happened Friday? stocks took a dive. can't find a reason.
You need to take the market cap of the preferred stock into account. Still not too cheap.
"up 17% premarket today, GREAT JOB STIFEL!!!! ThANK YOU FOR CALLING THE BOTTOM"
would be nice to get an update soon on leases
CORR-PA is down 23.27% to 12.14

13.86% drop today 10/17/2016. Is the sky falling or what? Is one of the the two major customers leaving? What????
"Given that UPL has rejected the lease and will stop paying rent to CORR from 7/1, I’m surprised this is trading as well as it is. It’s up significantly from the trading halt where they released that news."

The silence is deafening!
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 6.73% to 6.50
"After listening to the call and reviewing the presentation materials, this is definitely a “mixed bag” result for stockholders, depending at what price you own it. CORR has fundamentally changed, they own just 1 of their 3 original assets after 12 months (Omega is a minor 4th asset), after clearly having been burned by the 2 low-grade credit worthy tenants being Ultra and Cox. Management has responded by perhaps overreaching for an exceptionally reliable asset in Crimson. This “exchange” for higher-quality comes at a price in the form of dilution and a much lower than expected dividend. Personally, this is where my disappointment lies. However, CORR’s viability was at stake, (going from $45 to $4 demonstrates this) and no doubt that CORR now has much more stability going forward. No question.Here comes the part about where one owns CORR. I started buying small lots of CORR when it started dropping last Feb/March/April and have shares in the low $30’s $20’s and at $17. After watching it stumble over the summer, I bought bigger lots in October and November and again in early January at prices from $3.55 (Nov) and $5 (Oct) and then $6.65 (Jan). For me, those lower price shares will be worth the patience to hold. It appears I may have been wrong in my assumption that the Crimson contribution to the divvy would be in addition to what they already pay, so a 40 cent divvy may be the max that could be expected in the near term (12-18 months). With a cost basis on my lower shares of $4.25, that is a 9.4% yield and something worth holding for, especially since that may increase over time.For my stranded shares at $17 and above, it is not worth holding CORR for the 40 cent divvy and that diminished capital could be better deployed elsewhere. I am fortunate enough to have some gains already this year, and since BAM will be ultimately buying out my BPYU shares at some point this year as well, I plan to sell those higher priced CORR shares over the next year as an offsetting loss and adding those stranded funds to positions/opportunities elsewhere. My position in CORR will drop by about 40% due to those sales. For stockholders who weren’t able to grab shares at the lower levels, I wouldn’t expect CORR to really rebound in price significantly. $8-$12 is probably a likely range for CORR over the next 12 months, so sadly no rally back to higher levels for other longs and my (eventually formerly) stranded shares. But no question now about solvency and cash flow either, CORR will survive. Mixed bag for sure…."
"Any long timers if earning is this Wednesday or next Wednesday? If next week, it’s going to be chaotic."
CorEnergy Infr Trust is up 34.24% to 16.27
Something seems to be afoot! Maybe finally a positive development or anticiption...
"Lower than 2008 crash, just insane. Interest coverage ratio is 6x. P/FFO is around $2. I've added to my preferreds here and I'm ready to buy the common, but don't want to buy and then have it drop another 50%. Will wait for more confirmation on the market settling down."
How did Schulte get re-elected after what he has done to CORR ? Never reported the vote. This isn’t social promotion like school if you didn’t do well
It look like positive CORR news by mid February plus the dividend announcement.
$13.32 in pre-market. Up +25%
down 23 of the last 28 days. glad i bought at 42
what is the reason for the 15% drop in price today
acquisition is official!!! YAY or NAY??
The stock is now trading lower than the price it hit when the market crashed back in March....painful!
"I like the way CORR stock is acting. It’s telling me oil prices are going up. January futures price is over $45, vaccine is on the way and we will be over Covid in 6 months after everyone is vaccinated and we can get back to normal. Plus company issues will be settled very soon."
CORR came back strong today. I think within 3-4 months we will be back to $35 if not more. Because of that I loaded up today.
We need some news!! Come on CORR give us some!
Prior management needs to go. They took two properties and managed them so that they got 1/4 the purchase price when sold or traded.My hope is that the Crimson manage will eventually take over.
Top U.S. fuel pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline has shut its entire network after a cyber attack that industry sources said was caused by ransomware software. This could be an opportunity for CORR
This looks like a bargain
"WTI Crude Oil is now at $41.50 per barrel. I’d have to believe Cox Oil is looking to restart their Gulf wells and get back to production. They will need to work out a plan with CORR as back rent contractually accrues, meaning they owe millions of dollars to CORR and us shareholders. I would think an araingement to extend lease with a portion payment can be worked out. But more importantly, Cox Oil starts making future rent payments. Based upon this occurring, I see a $25.00 stock price and the dividend of at least $1.00 per share."
any news on why this dropped so much today?
Any good news coming? Too late to sell.
why has the preferred volumes been non existent today?
This is my guess: WTI price went below $40 and threatened Cox Oils profitablity. Will they stop their wells again?
When do you think this will return to 40$
Can anyone answer this question ? Why would any company merge with CORR based on CORR’s operating record.Anybody?
"I really wanted this deal to be a game changer but it is not. Just more of the short sighted poorly negotiated actions we have seen in the past. The real kicker was the dividend sitting at 20c for an unspecified time. I just sold half of my holdings and will wait another week to see if this turns around. My money went into OKE which in my view is more aligned with the future and has a stunning dividend. I lost a bundle on this stock but have a small profit on the 2000 shares I have left. I do have one question for those of you who are still supporting this deal. If these are such great assets, why did Crimson sell them in the first place !"
There’s absolutely no reason for a drop. I see these guys going up￼
it's bargain price now. I am in
"is CORR, more or less, permanently a $ 7- $ 9 stock with a maybe 20 cent dividend ?is there any realistic hope that we could see a $ 1 dividend in the next year or so ?they were sitting on $ 100 million for a "" future "" investment. does anything think they will actually do anything with this ?it seems odd that there has been no insider selling of CORR for the last 5 years, only insider buying was this as much as surprise for them as it has been for us ?any thoughts ? I thought this was a pretty conservative investment, one year ago. $ 3 dividend and $ 40 share priceany thoughts ?"
CORR-PA is up 18.26% to 13.74
I don’t think Sprint is comparable to CORR. Sprints system was different from all the other cellphone carriers. CORR JUST MANAGED THEIR OPERATIONS POORLY !!

Anybody have an idea what's happening to our share price?
"Anyone listen to the CC? This was the best call, information and confidence-wise, I have heard from CORR in many quarters. The acquisition front seems very promising, especially if they get into the renewable energy distribution area, but they also made a strong case for hydrocarbons (something I agree with as I've also been buying XOM here). I appreciate the due diligence they are performing and I do understand that they have to be pretty quiet on the GIGS asset, since they are trying to work something out without pulling the litigation trigger. Next 3-6 months could be very interesting for CORR and we may look back in a year or so and wonder how it ever got this low, IMHO."
something must be up. price keeps rising.
anyone have any have idea weather to keep holding or sell ?
This stock is ready to boom.
I thought COX owed us $ 30 mill. DId we just write it off ? what happened to that property ? can they do that ?

"Stifel Downgrades CorEnergy Infr Trust to Sell, Announces $1 Price Target..Thankfully I have a small position.. I won't sell I'll probably pick up a tiny lot.."
We got NEWS
Management negligence to have two customers providing all of your revenues. How long has this management team been promising new acquisitions and not delivered. One of the worst 10Ks I ever had the misfortune to read. Time for a few changes at the top.
"If Pindale is so worthless, how is it we didn't even know it was for sale and they already secured a buyer? Who got paid on this deal?Anybody else happy about management looking forward to spending our last 100 million?"
"damn, last week was ultra bullish for CORR (or so it seemed) and we nearly broke $10 TWICEHowever, price action has retraced backwards 10-12% so we're basing for another big breakout IF we can get the damn GIGS issue resolved + acquisition.At the same time, oil itself is breaking out slowly and could test $55 soon......The stars are aligning.....For anyone who wants a good risk reward play, look into the $10/12.50 call spreads which pay up to 5-6x your call premium. Feb 19 buy $10 call , sell $12.50 call. Net price is about $45-55 but with gains up to $250 per spreadShort term trade for sure, but you get their earnings + acquisition? announcement so its priced into the premiumIf you want to pay a bit more for the March spreads, you can buy the $10 and sell the $15 for ~$100 and upside up to $500"
Disappointed that we have not seen insiders buying. Environment is better than a month ago. Saudis cut oil production as well as exports. Demand will outpace supply in 2 weeks. When Cox turn on the rigs they have to negotiate April and May rent. I’m maxed out in Corr. Unfortunately it will drift lower with no news.
Is the earnings report after market today?
"It will be interesting to see if we get a bump from the 3 investor conferences this week for CORR, last one is Friday. I checked out the presentation from IR, nothing too new, other than a mention that GIGS litigation is on hold pending settlement negotiations. With $30M in past due rent, any resolution would be favorable to CORR's stock price, which seems to be pricing in the end of that asset. LOL!"
Too much hype: Not enough information on why assets purchased in a state known for its anti carbon stance.Not a good business decision on it's surface
CORR down 12 of the last 14 trading days impressive
1 year ago a $ 3 dividend; now a $ 7 stock. a great management team
Any news about Cox payment? Crude Oil prices seem to be enough high.
Is the $1 forecast from Stifel overly generous ???
shouldn't this be over $15?
CorEnergy Infr Trust is up 12.38% to 8.08
Looks like something is cooking...Price is running up rapidly these past few days (~25%). Some people are in the know...
we are aiming for the 1's and 2's. Im in at 42.
WHen will they ever make an acquisition? I have waiting three years for one.

My purchases started at $33 and ended at $3.65, now with a cost basis of $13.25 on the whole position, I am feeling much better about CORR and even a divvy at half of the past level (i.e. $1.50/yr vs $3.00/yr) I will be getting a yield of over 11% when the dividends return (assumptions notwithstanding). CORR has been my only loser (so far) from my spring/summer COVID REIT load up, so its time for CORR to giddy up."

We get diluted. We pay cash. We give up an asset that owes us cash (in a rising market). We take on debt. What we get in return is a piddily dividend and 1800 miles of headache - California regulated pipelines.

With Cox back on line i feel over feel over the next year or two the stock should be able to get back at least to $30 and pay a decent dividend.

Conference starting at 10 am
great price to average down with. CORR on fire sale!!!
Anyone thinking of voting against the Crimson deal?
This room used to be so chatty; miss the pals here.Anyone has any idea what's would be the new valuation for this stock and what dividends will be like.
Im riding this all the way back to Q1 of 2020 baby
Crimson's California Pipeline is really a good asset with good returns and now Corr is more diversified. Most probably it will return its dividend back in a couple of quaters.
What are the odds that not long after the sale goes through that UPL gets acquired......
$23 in a year. Good news.
is there an unknown bad news? someone's selling out for a reason.

"Held my nose and bought my last batch at $5.72. The ""no news"" has this dripping lower, but at some point the Cox issue will be resolved. One way or another and if Cox can't get their oil out without CORR, this is a different situation than Pinedale. Plus, with everyone cutting production and exploration (will XOM be the last shoe to drop?) oil should steady and even rise. Anyhoo, I can sit on this and be patient."

Who is selling shares? More informed investors? Before the news about Pinedale was released the stock was falling each day with movements uncorrelated to the oil price; I had a feeling somebody was constantly dumping shares.
Anyone else confused by the price action today? Earnings report was better than expected...
"According to my calculation, this stock is worth 16.81 without multiplier ... however, yahoo finance shows it to be overvalued ... what am I missing??"
Why was CORR in the 40s just before covid? Can it get back to $20-30.
Halted
I see NGL is having similar fate with one of their clients going BK. Anyone here owns or has opinions about it?
CORR-PA is up 16.87% to 9.70
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 6.22% to 4.78
I'd buy the company out if had the dough. what's the chance of this company being bought if someone makes an offer?
Can wait to see 2Q earnings come out and find out how much the Crimson purchase can actually help the stock price and dividend.
"So I mailed Investor Relations at CorEnergy and was surprised to get a mail back within the hour. I complained about lack of communication (even though I understand there are some things they cant say), while the stock continues to tank and what about shareholders? Someone called Matt Kreps said, he understands and that was it. No apology, no commitment to pass the mail up the chain of command, nothing. I suggest all shareholders mail them as I did until something happens."
Based on remaining assets to invest. You can forget about a $3.00 ever coming back. Maybe $1.50 might make more sense.I hope they have insurance against business interruption from hurricanes. This price looks very cheap
oil about to cross $50!!
Hi there. Can anybody tell in nutshell why is such a panic sale taking place? Will appreciate
"There are 13.65 million ordinary shares in circulation.Yesterday there were 4 purchases of 100,000 shares = 400,000 shares (~3% of all shares)Total trading volume ~ 12% of all sharesI think a bad forecast merges individual investors, and funds are averaged, most likely this is manipulation.I looked at several early forecasts from Stiefel ... thePrice falls after the negative forecast is released, there are several averaging, then growth.There is a chance of good growth if a deal is concluded in December for a new asset."
"Where you at Tom? I listened to the whole investor call, it seems like management has decided to reduce their risk and increase it's market share. P66 in California is closing a refinery which will add more market share to CORR, too. This deal is robust and also helps to rectify the GIGS/ COX lease nonpayment issue. Not sure why the stock went up 11% then fell to below %5 at the moment. You're words of wisdom are welcome!"
"Interesting option movement.....this week over 160,000 shares bought on Dec 2019 call options at a $50 strike price."
Ex Div date has past....waiting to see what the price action will do today 8/16/19. Volume and direction.
down 4 out of 5 trading days this week. not bad. great management. way to go fellas
"where does this stop ? $ 2 ? $ 3 ? I'm in at $ 40, so thats-that. Dreadful management"
why is stock price not crashing? weird...
Would like to hear something from HQ to prop the price up
We now have insider buying at CORR. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1347652.htm
"Let's review recent events here:- Oil goes through a period of unprecedented volatility- During the volatility, one of CORR's tenants with a history of filing for CH 11 during volatility files for CH 11 -- 99% chance that lease gets renegotiated down some %age points and is paid at the newer negotiated rate when the company emerges (this has happened with this tenant before in recent history)- Also during that unprecented volatiility, one of CORR's larger tenants.. representing ~40% of revenue, says they need to hold off on payments for a month or two.. WHILE OIL PRICES ARE NEGATIVE... yes, ""sorry we can't afford to pay you right now because the main thing we produce has negative prices"".. pretty reasonable- About 1.5 months after that bigger tenant said they can't make rent in April, Oil went from $14 / barrel in April, to negative prices in May, and is now trading at around $40 in June.. and major stock indicies are making new highs....what do you think is going to happen here?? I was jacked OXY since last Friday, and CORR looks like an even stronger opportunitiy to me now based solely on the math of the sum of the parts. I'm Long."
just read how hard CEQP lawyers fought the CHK bankruptcy filing. I wonder how hard CORR lawyers fought UPL bankruptcy filing before giving up all that asset.
why is it tanking?
CORR-PA is up 10.07% to 15.30
Is it close to the bottom yet or will it be heading down to five? Any thoughts?
The market is telling me there is too much exotic paper issued to do this deal. Will the managements mesh well. I think If they come back with 1.40 dividend the stock price will be higher and they could issue stock to pay down or pay off these various preferred shares and debt. The market did not react well to this merger. It’s down 30c

"So just out of curiousity , are we waiting for backpay for GIGS etc..What's gonna move us in the right direction?"
CORR-PA is down 19.26% to 14.30
"they were supposed to buy a new acquisition by the end of this year. no good asset, I guess."
Finally got some solid good news. Tomorrow will be interesting. The entire energy sector has been in fire but CORR hasn’t been
CORR-PA is down 17.40% to 15.05
"why are Chinese ""investors"" telling stockholders it is good for the company to by pipeline assets in CA which hates carbon fuels?"
Is there a default risk? I cannot tell. Can you?
No reason for the stock to be so l￼ow.
"Math plays on the long side. With 2 tenantsthe probability they both fail to pay the lease is 25%the probability one of the two fails is 50%the probability both resume paying is 25%In other words, there is 75% probability of a positive outcome for shareholders."
"Hey REDDIT users: Melvin Capital is short CORR, let's go get 'em! LOL! Seriously, the retail targeting of heavily shorted stocks is like nothing I have seen in my 30 years of investing/trading. Yes, I had GME at $4.30 from last spring, thought I was a genius for selling it at $28 for a 500% gain an look where it is now. Unreal!"
"From Oilprice website.U.S. Pipeline Operators Offer Special Deals To Oil Producers:Some of the largest pipeline operators in the U.S. have started to offer sweeter deals for crude oil shipment to producers as the midstream sector vies to curb its losses and keep its relevance amid the oil demand and production decline. Pipeline companies, including Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Product Partners, and Energy Transfer, have cut shipment rates in contract negotiations or have offered more advantageous rates in current contracts to U.S. oil producers to keep their customers amid a pipeline overcapacity and an overall slump in oil demand and oil production in the United States, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Magellan Midstream Partners has even offered to its customers the option to ship crude on its pipeline only when market conditions are favorable, according to Reuters. This approach differs from the typical take-or-pay contracts between an upstream and a midstream company for moving oil out of a production center. Caught between production curtailments and bankruptcies in the U.S. shale patch and reduced demand for fuels from the downstream, pipeline operators have seen pipeline utilization rates and their revenues fall this year. After the oil price crash in March, pipeline infrastructure companies started to announce deferrals of final investment decisions and start-up dates for planned oil and gas pipelines, especially in the Permian, which suddenly found itself with a overbuild of capacity as production and consumption of oil struggled to recover from the pandemic-driven crisis.The latest announcement of a canceled oil pipeline came from Enterprise Products Partners, which said earlier this month that it was scrapping the 450,000 barrels per day Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline project.Current pipeline capacity in the Permian is exceeding production so much that in a year or two, when pipelines currently under construction are completed, Permian producers could find themselves using just half of the available takeaway infrastructure, according to analysts."

CORR should be trading $15-$17 now while awaiting news. Still very undervalued!
Preferred down 22% but common only down 12%. Go figure.
Well... this hurts
Thats torn it. Another one way conference call tomorrow and no news on GIGS or new assets. What a shower. Time for a management change...
"Since the stock has been making more and more lows, the comments have dwindled to a few.Guess the ""retail"" investor has exited this name for now, until it's back to $20 and paying a hefty 10%+ dividend again.Who's still invested in this company? I'm in with a avg price of $7.75, so down a bit but looking longer term"
Anyone know why the sudden drop? I see dividends are still active and they were only $0.05 off of the quarterly estimate.
"This company has $10.13 in cash, and the debt situation is not really a situation at all for CORR. The company could pay down 75% of total debt TODAY, in CASH if they wanted to without even diluting shareholders. So.. insolvency or any catastrophic event like that isn't really ont he table.. so continuing on..PP&E had carrying value of $109 MM on the last Q, and leased property was carried at $389 MM. And prior to COVID, investors were paying about a 65% premium on those assets at a $800 - $900 MM valuation.Even if thsee assets are to trade at a discount right now, which there is an argument for, it seems like we have overshot by a long way. Again.. looking at this in the most pessimistic way even, I can't wrap my head around this company being worth less than $300 MM, and even in a mildly optimistic scenario, closer to $450. Any value guys out there want to chime in?"
"Q1 Results:CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust (CORR -9.8%) plunges after preliminary Q1 operating results reveal $15.7M in lease revenue and $5.2M in transportation and distribution revenue.But CorEnergy recorded a $30.1M writeoff for deferred rent receivable related to the Grand Isle Lease agreement, resulting in a net loss of $9.1M for the quarter.The company recognized a ~$140M loss on impairment of leased property related to the Grand Isle Gathering System, resulting in a quarterly net loss attributable to stockholders of $164.3M, or $12.04/share.An agreement in principle was reached to sell the Pinedale LGS asset to UPL for $18M, with proceeds from the sale plus any cash remaining at Pinedale LP expected to satisfy any remaining debt at Pinedale LGS and thus eliminate any debt repayment obligations from CorEnergy.CorEnergy says Q2 results will reflect a ~$147M charge for the Pinedale LGS, which could be partially offset by any reduction of debt owed."
"being a small business, looks like they're doing their best in the tough market. I need a tons of patience on this one."
does anybody know if they have enough income coming in from their remaining tenants to pay their mortgages/ debt obligations?
"Looks like RBC was given the information that was released today. No insider information here, SEC........"
"Dollar Bill here,In my opinion, if Cox et al does not want to pay the rent, shut the valve. Constipation will resolve their problems. In the meantime, use your storage tank capacity to buy really cheap oil. Oil will go negative again at the end of next quarter if not sooner.. Hard ball..."
Saudis said the reduced oil output would only be until July. And avg wti price would be around 38'ish. Little below $40 needed for profitability. Will Cox restart their wells sooner than later?
i owned this equity back in 2016 when oil was on the VC verge of extinction with the Saudis attempting to destroy fracking forever. it did ok. better than ok then it is a different game now. personally I don't think America will be like it was for years. maybe forever in my time span. The US economy was built on petroleum. I don't know if it will happen again
"outstanding management. we lose 2 of the 3 major assets, considerable stock dilution, and we take on huge debt. Shrewd, very shrewd. Brilliant. and we get a 20 cent dividend instead of $ 3. Clever"
No news?
Why nothing on Cox STILL!?
any idea why Corr was able to sue Cox in 2016 but not this time? I used that reasoning to buy up Corr.
"well, we knew this was coming; terrible news not unexpected."
oil UP and COR dropping like a stone. do you think someone knows something ? remembering my $ 3 annual dividend less than 2 years ago. they done good
Will the dividend eventually return to 0.75 a share? Thoughts??
Going up AH
"I just don’t see it. Their whole business model is broken! They had to sell one of their most profitable and productive assets to the tenant for pennies on the dollar because the tenant figured out an alternative way to move its product. Most of its other tenants are bankrupt and not even producing at the moment. The product itself has very low demand, and even the big majors are now saying we have hit peak oil and demand is unlikely to really come back. I can understand wanting to play a potential oil/gas rebound for later this year or early next. But I think this company is just not the right one to bet on"
I don't see any red flags. And the price is great but maybe getting even better.

"I've invested in their preferred shares, CORR-PA, and I'm feeling really comfortable with that."
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.93% to 4.30
I took a serious bath on this stock. Fortunately I sold half of my holdings at the top but am still hanging on to 2000 shares. The management team are not doing their job by staying dark on progress with acquisitions. We dont need details but should have some news on progress to help buoy up the share price.....
Profit taking today? New shareholder here.
I keep hoping there’s a way back for this company. They must be making some money on the natural gas. I agree with oil not coming back to anything like previous demand. There are too many electric autos coming in the next few years
CORR is on sale at the dollar store
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.83% to 5.73
"Have a nice day, everyone, the stock performs well at this level. It may be slow, but the reversal"
Has any one noticed how strong the pivot point at 11.10 was on Friday ?? It will be tested at least once again.
"""equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $50.00 per share of the Company's common stock."" Still 10% until the bonds are 'in-the-money'"
CORR-PA is up 16.42% to 18.51
"Hi anyone here. Is it good point to go long at 7,00 or I’m late. I think it’s a still good point to entry."
"just hold 1-3 years, with high inflation and high oil prices this will 2-4x easy."
"I have owned both common and pref'd shares since May 2017 in two accounts, my regular brokerage account and my wife's IRA account. Made some very decent Capital gain and dividend money selling off all the Preferred's lately at $21.59, I bought some cheap at $14.27 and had some just below the $25 par since the beginning of this investment. I figure it was time to sell, swapping for a higher dividend gain. Still own the common shares, dumped 100 shares out of a Roth IRA at a small profit from dividend return. This has been an investment gain over the long run, but still holding at a loss on the remaining common shares. The COVID VIRUS market mess is the entire reason, some of their holdings were financially weak and could not survive the payout. It is hard to find viable deals that fit their structure, as many are good assets, with weak financial strength. My only choice is to hold the common shares and wait for a $12 to $14 price to break almost even."
Seems like this follows the price of oil.
"Since Ultra will be paying rent during BK (just like in 2016), CORR has only lost rent from Cox, and presumably can return the divvy back to 50% of what it paid before, instead of 75 cents CORR should be able to pay 37.5 cents per Qtr, or $1.50 per year, which is almost a 15% yield here. Once Cox gets back to pumping and thus paying rent, CORR should be paying it's full divvy again. Just added the final batch to my position this morning."
60% of float shorted ;)
35% premarket! Will it fall 30% by 10am???
Does lack of oil storage help Corr. Just bought because low bv.
what effect the rising inflation has on CORR and its price?
"From Ultra's release:The Company has secured a commitment for financing of up to $25 million from certain holders of the Company’s first lien term loan, which combined with cash on hand and its normal operating cash flow, is expected to allow Ultra to maintain normal operations and meet ongoing financial commitments throughout the Chapter 11 restructuring period. Additionally, all of the Company’s existing lenders under its first lien RBL credit facility have executed commitment letters to provide exit financing in the form of a revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $100 million and total commitments of $60 million.The Company also expects to pay suppliers and vendors in full under normal terms for goods and services and will continue making royalty and working interest payments when due."
someone or some hedgie bought a 15k block at yesterday's close
"CORR has now fallen 22 of the last 27 trading days. Amazing management. this is extremely hard to do, unless you are Enron"
"Unless there is another shoe to drop, this deal is not compelling. GIGS and Cox debt given away, more debt and more stock issued for pipelines in a state which services refineries specific to their needs while California is accelerating the move to get rid of the ICE. Oh, and oil pipelines in a state known for wildfires and awaiting a major earthquake event. My holdings here are 20k underwater and getting deeper by the minute..."
CorEnergy Infr Trust is up 12.00% to 5.32
CORR-PA is down 14.17% to 10.22
The short trade....When the levee breaks.......have no place to go.
If CORR management resigned and Crimson management stepped in I think that would help the company and stock.CORR management has run their assets into the ground. Crimson management received equity and I think they would want to protect that
some of the larger hedge funds sold shares... see Yahoo article
"That thud you heard was the sound of the shorts getting pounded into dust. It will be very interesting to see the next updated short % of float which had been over 10% for a good long time, now under 4%. GLTA"
CORR is a great company. I am going to double what I have today.
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 6.31% to 7.41
how low will this get? I think it might go to sub 2.
I wonder what Stifel knows that the Chairman of CORR didn’t discuss. They are sitting on 150 million cash.
I notice that REIT’s are making new highs in this market but not CORR.
Have we reached peak pessimism? I think we're close. Looking to start a meaningful position.
"CEO is suffering here as well, look at all the buys in the $30's...no sells. Must be as frustrated as the rest of us with how the market is pricing the stock.https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1107140.htm"
some large owner got tired of CORR and selling it. Down hard today.
"from a $ 3 yearly dividend to SP of $ 5.32. not bad, huh ?"
Loving the follow through on this recent price movement.
"T-minus 30 days on announcement of a new deal. If Vegas had odds on this, I think it would be 65%. It was higher after the conference call and will probably go down by about 2% per day from here. C'mon guys put something on the table that shows your enterprise has a viable path forward."
I feel that they may be near some sort of announcement since the stock was at one point up about 13%.
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 7.08% to 4.07
"Adding to my CORR position here. Market Cap is now $160M, all of their assets were purchased for a total of $598M, so one is getting the assets for 26.75% of the original purchase value here at $11.60 or so."
"Similar pattern to 2016, with Chapter 11, with COVID involved this could likely have a much better result and bring the stock back to the $20’ quicklyhttps://investors.corenergy.reit/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/CorEnergy-Releases-First-Quarter-2016-Results/default.aspx"
CORR-PA reached a 52 Week low at 24.12
Beautiful recovery. Wish I woulda bought the dip yesterday 
"Very bullish price action, reasonably high volume lately"
"Lets get CORR down to a dollar, then we all buy CORR."
Does anyone know why this stock isn’t moving with all the gains on oil?
"Wow, quickest call ever, exactly nine minutes. I didn't hear anything new, but there is some hope that Cox begins pumping oil again since prices have stabilized and CORR is pursuing their back rent in Court. David said they will be looking to an acquisition with the $100M+ they have to ""rebuild"" the business. No Q&A. Ho-hum CC......"
what's happening today? Did Cox restart their wells?
CORR is falling harder than market today. Any new news?
"Wow, Stifel goes from a sell to a hold with an objective of $ 5 .Welcome aboard"
Where is the news?
CORR is down -4.93% to 37.04
"Additionally, we are exchanging CorEnergy’s single-tenant GIGS asset for long-lived critical infrastructure pipeline systems used by a diverse group of investment-grade rated customers"
CORR reached a new 52 Week Low at $33.86
