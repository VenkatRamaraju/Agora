"Held my nose and bought my last batch at $5.72. The ""no news"" has this dripping lower, but at some point the Cox issue will be resolved. One way or another and if Cox can't get their oil out without CORR, this is a different situation than Pinedale. Plus, with everyone cutting production and exploration (will XOM be the last shoe to drop?) oil should steady and even rise. Anyhoo, I can sit on this and be patient."
"After listening to the call and reviewing the presentation materials, this is definitely a “mixed bag” result for stockholders, depending at what price you own it. CORR has fundamentally changed, they own just 1 of their 3 original assets after 12 months (Omega is a minor 4th asset), after clearly having been burned by the 2 low-grade credit worthy tenants being Ultra and Cox. Management has responded by perhaps overreaching for an exceptionally reliable asset in Crimson. This “exchange” for higher-quality comes at a price in the form of dilution and a much lower than expected dividend. Personally, this is where my disappointment lies. However, CORR’s viability was at stake, (going from $45 to $4 demonstrates this) and no doubt that CORR now has much more stability going forward. No question.Here comes the part about where one owns CORR. I started buying small lots of CORR when it started dropping last Feb/March/April and have shares in the low $30’s $20’s and at $17. After watching it stumble over the summer, I bought bigger lots in October and November and again in early January at prices from $3.55 (Nov) and $5 (Oct) and then $6.65 (Jan). For me, those lower price shares will be worth the patience to hold. It appears I may have been wrong in my assumption that the Crimson contribution to the divvy would be in addition to what they already pay, so a 40 cent divvy may be the max that could be expected in the near term (12-18 months). With a cost basis on my lower shares of $4.25, that is a 9.4% yield and something worth holding for, especially since that may increase over time.For my stranded shares at $17 and above, it is not worth holding CORR for the 40 cent divvy and that diminished capital could be better deployed elsewhere. I am fortunate enough to have some gains already this year, and since BAM will be ultimately buying out my BPYU shares at some point this year as well, I plan to sell those higher priced CORR shares over the next year as an offsetting loss and adding those stranded funds to positions/opportunities elsewhere. My position in CORR will drop by about 40% due to those sales. For stockholders who weren’t able to grab shares at the lower levels, I wouldn’t expect CORR to really rebound in price significantly. $8-$12 is probably a likely range for CORR over the next 12 months, so sadly no rally back to higher levels for other longs and my (eventually formerly) stranded shares. But no question now about solvency and cash flow either, CORR will survive. Mixed bag for sure…."
down 4 out of 5 trading days this week. not bad. great management. way to go fellas
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.10% to 4.62
"I really wanted this deal to be a game changer but it is not. Just more of the short sighted poorly negotiated actions we have seen in the past. The real kicker was the dividend sitting at 20c for an unspecified time. I just sold half of my holdings and will wait another week to see if this turns around. My money went into OKE which in my view is more aligned with the future and has a stunning dividend. I lost a bundle on this stock but have a small profit on the 2000 shares I have left. I do have one question for those of you who are still supporting this deal. If these are such great assets, why did Crimson sell them in the first place !"
"Hopefully everyone here added or at least held during CORR's swoon under $5. The SP recovery is on the way, at this rate we'll be back over $10 in short order. My purchases started at $33 and ended at $3.65, now with a cost basis of $13.25 on the whole position, I am feeling much better about CORR and even a divvy at half of the past level (i.e. $1.50/yr vs $3.00/yr) I will be getting a yield of over 11% when the dividends return (assumptions notwithstanding). CORR has been my only loser (so far) from my spring/summer COVID REIT load up, so its time for CORR to giddy up."
There’s a lot of short sellers on this stock. If it pops a dollar it will really start to run when the squeeze hits
"Today, management of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) commented on the oil spill that has been reported offshore near Huntington Beach, California, noting that it occurred on a pipeline not owned by the Company. The Company does not own or operate any offshore platforms or pipelines.The Company has historically received barrels transported by the affected pipeline, at an average of approximately 4,600 bpd over the past four months, equating to average monthly revenue of approximately $98,000 during that time (including the associated pipeline loss allowance). Currently, this production has been shut in and the timing of its return is uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, we do not expect this event to affect our common dividend outlook, which is subject to board approval."
I have a few hundred of these at a cost basis of a shade over $15. Thinking of holding as long as they pay a dividend but open to thoughts. Should I hold for another year at least to see if comes back up to $15? Or sell my position by the end of the year for tax harvest and reinvest somewhere else? Any recommendations welcome. Thanks!
"Let's review recent events here:- Oil goes through a period of unprecedented volatility- During the volatility, one of CORR's tenants with a history of filing for CH 11 during volatility files for CH 11 -- 99% chance that lease gets renegotiated down some %age points and is paid at the newer negotiated rate when the company emerges (this has happened with this tenant before in recent history)- Also during that unprecented volatiility, one of CORR's larger tenants.. representing ~40% of revenue, says they need to hold off on payments for a month or two.. WHILE OIL PRICES ARE NEGATIVE... yes, ""sorry we can't afford to pay you right now because the main thing we produce has negative prices"".. pretty reasonable- About 1.5 months after that bigger tenant said they can't make rent in April, Oil went from $14 / barrel in April, to negative prices in May, and is now trading at around $40 in June.. and major stock indicies are making new highs....what do you think is going to happen here?? I was jacked OXY since last Friday, and CORR looks like an even stronger opportunitiy to me now based solely on the math of the sum of the parts. I'm Long."
we are aiming for the 1's and 2's. Im in at 42.
"Almost 8.5% of the float is sold short (1.15M shares as of Jan 15th). Given the Crimson news, there is little reason to be short anymore as CORR is clearly solvent and profitable with the Crimson acquisition. Deal valued at $350M generating $50M+ in EBITDA, with CORR also having the profitable MoGas and Omega assets. Crimson's clients are investment grade with regulated revenue to CORR. Seems like this takes a huge amount of risk out of CORR's shares and adds a lot of value, smaller divvy notwithstanding. Looking forward to the call tomorrow."
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 7.00% to 4.89
"Where you at Tom? I listened to the whole investor call, it seems like management has decided to reduce their risk and increase it's market share. P66 in California is closing a refinery which will add more market share to CORR, too. This deal is robust and also helps to rectify the GIGS/ COX lease nonpayment issue. Not sure why the stock went up 11% then fell to below %5 at the moment. You're words of wisdom are welcome!"
"well come on, turn around!"
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 5.57% to 5.09
"This company has $10.13 in cash, and the debt situation is not really a situation at all for CORR. The company could pay down 75% of total debt TODAY, in CASH if they wanted to without even diluting shareholders. So.. insolvency or any catastrophic event like that isn't really ont he table.. so continuing on..PP&E had carrying value of $109 MM on the last Q, and leased property was carried at $389 MM. And prior to COVID, investors were paying about a 65% premium on those assets at a $800 - $900 MM valuation.Even if thsee assets are to trade at a discount right now, which there is an argument for, it seems like we have overshot by a long way. Again.. looking at this in the most pessimistic way even, I can't wrap my head around this company being worth less than $300 MM, and even in a mildly optimistic scenario, closer to $450. Any value guys out there want to chime in?"
"The common stock looks like a buy to me, given the price and the cash flows."
"CORR has now fallen 22 of the last 27 trading days. Amazing management. this is extremely hard to do, unless you are Enron"
