"So I mailed Investor Relations at CorEnergy and was surprised to get a mail back within the hour. I complained about lack of communication (even though I understand there are some things they cant say), while the stock continues to tank and what about shareholders? Someone called Matt Kreps said, he understands and that was it. No apology, no commitment to pass the mail up the chain of command, nothing. I suggest all shareholders mail them as I did until something happens."
I have a few hundred of these at a cost basis of a shade over $15. Thinking of holding as long as they pay a dividend but open to thoughts. Should I hold for another year at least to see if comes back up to $15? Or sell my position by the end of the year for tax harvest and reinvest somewhere else? Any recommendations welcome. Thanks!
"Hopefully everyone here added or at least held during CORR's swoon under $5. The SP recovery is on the way, at this rate we'll be back over $10 in short order. My purchases started at $33 and ended at $3.65, now with a cost basis of $13.25 on the whole position, I am feeling much better about CORR and even a divvy at half of the past level (i.e. $1.50/yr vs $3.00/yr) I will be getting a yield of over 11% when the dividends return (assumptions notwithstanding). CORR has been my only loser (so far) from my spring/summer COVID REIT load up, so its time for CORR to giddy up."
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 5.57% to 5.09
we are aiming for the 1's and 2's. Im in at 42.
UPDATE!!! The acquisition is coming!! read today's 8-K on CORR's site!!
Crimson's California Pipeline is really a good asset with good returns and now Corr is more diversified. Most probably it will return its dividend back in a couple of quaters.
"well come on, turn around!"
"There are 13.65 million ordinary shares in circulation.Yesterday there were 4 purchases of 100,000 shares = 400,000 shares (~3% of all shares)Total trading volume ~ 12% of all sharesI think a bad forecast merges individual investors, and funds are averaged, most likely this is manipulation.I looked at several early forecasts from Stiefel ... thePrice falls after the negative forecast is released, there are several averaging, then growth.There is a chance of good growth if a deal is concluded in December for a new asset."
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.10% to 4.62
"Wouldn’t this be interpreted as a rush to settle for the sake of PR. Cox Operating L.L.C Responds to Misrepresentation in Press Release by CorEnergyBusiness WireApril 17, 2020, 10:07 AM CDTToday, Cox Operating L.L.C. delivered the following communication, in substance, to CorEnergy.RE: Notice of material misrepresentations and demandOn April 13, 2020, on behalf of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (""CorEnergy""), you stated in a FORM 8-K that ""Cox Oil has provided notification of its intent to suspend payment of rent, beginning with the April payment, on the Grand Isle Gathering System…"" Furthermore, in a press release incorporated into the FORM 8-K, as Exhibit 99.1, you stated that ""Cox attributed the decision to its plan to shut in production on all of its wells in the Gulf of Mexico….""These statements, among others, in your published communications are false, inaccurate, and require immediate correction. By way of example only and not limitation, the rent-paying tenant in the operative agreement concerning the referenced Grand Isle Gathering System is Energy XXI GIGS Services, LLC, not ""Cox Oil"" or ""Cox,"" as you misrepresent in your public statements and disclosures. Furthermore, reference to Cox shutting in production on all Gulf of Mexico wells is false, misleading, and exceedingly harmful to the business interests of Cox.About Cox Operating, L.L.C.Cox is a privately-held entity that owns and operates assets in the Gulf of Mexico and was founded by fourth generation oilman, Brad E. Cox. Cox has grown through enhanced development of production and reserves in existing assets along with strategic acquisitions.

"CEO is suffering here as well, look at all the buys in the $30's...no sells. Must be as frustrated as the rest of us with how the market is pricing the stock.https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1107140.htm"
"I really wanted this deal to be a game changer but it is not. Just more of the short sighted poorly negotiated actions we have seen in the past. The real kicker was the dividend sitting at 20c for an unspecified time. I just sold half of my holdings and will wait another week to see if this turns around. My money went into OKE which in my view is more aligned with the future and has a stunning dividend. I lost a bundle on this stock but have a small profit on the 2000 shares I have left. I do have one question for those of you who are still supporting this deal. If these are such great assets, why did Crimson sell them in the first place !"
down 4 out of 5 trading days this week. not bad. great management. way to go fellas
"I bought my first 1000 shares at $36 about 3.5 years ago when it paid an 8% dividend. I added shares at $21 ,$18,and finally another 2000 shares at $12 for a total of a little over 5000 shares. With Cox back on line i feel over feel over the next year or two the stock should be able to get back at least to $30 and pay a decent dividend. Remember before the virus we were as high as $49 per share.Good luck to long term holders."
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is up 7.00% to 4.89
It look like positive CORR news by mid February plus the dividend announcement.
"Today, management of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) commented on the oil spill that has been reported offshore near Huntington Beach, California, noting that it occurred on a pipeline not owned by the Company. The Company does not own or operate any offshore platforms or pipelines.The Company has historically received barrels transported by the affected pipeline, at an average of approximately 4,600 bpd over the past four months, equating to average monthly revenue of approximately $98,000 during that time (including the associated pipeline loss allowance). Currently, this production has been shut in and the timing of its return is uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, we do not expect this event to affect our common dividend outlook, which is subject to board approval."
"The common stock looks like a buy to me, given the price and the cash flows."
"T-minus 30 days on announcement of a new deal. If Vegas had odds on this, I think it would be 65%. It was higher after the conference call and will probably go down by about 2% per day from here. C'mon guys put something on the table that shows your enterprise has a viable path forward."
"After listening to the call and reviewing the presentation materials, this is definitely a “mixed bag” result for stockholders, depending at what price you own it. CORR has fundamentally changed, they own just 1 of their 3 original assets after 12 months (Omega is a minor 4th asset), after clearly having been burned by the 2 low-grade credit worthy tenants being Ultra and Cox. Management has responded by perhaps overreaching for an exceptionally reliable asset in Crimson. This “exchange” for higher-quality comes at a price in the form of dilution and a much lower than expected dividend. Personally, this is where my disappointment lies. However, CORR’s viability was at stake, (going from $45 to $4 demonstrates this) and no doubt that CORR now has much more stability going forward. No question.Here comes the part about where one owns CORR. I started buying small lots of CORR when it started dropping last Feb/March/April and have shares in the low $30’s $20’s and at $17. After watching it stumble over the summer, I bought bigger lots in October and November and again in early January at prices from $3.55 (Nov) and $5 (Oct) and then $6.65 (Jan). For me, those lower price shares will be worth the patience to hold. It appears I may have been wrong in my assumption that the Crimson contribution to the divvy would be in addition to what they already pay, so a 40 cent divvy may be the max that could be expected in the near term (12-18 months). With a cost basis on my lower shares of $4.25, that is a 9.4% yield and something worth holding for, especially since that may increase over time.For my stranded shares at $17 and above, it is not worth holding CORR for the 40 cent divvy and that diminished capital could be better deployed elsewhere. I am fortunate enough to have some gains already this year, and since BAM will be ultimately buying out my BPYU shares at some point this year as well, I plan to sell those higher priced CORR shares over the next year as an offsetting loss and adding those stranded funds to positions/opportunities elsewhere. My position in CORR will drop by about 40% due to those sales. For stockholders who weren’t able to grab shares at the lower levels, I wouldn’t expect CORR to really rebound in price significantly. $8-$12 is probably a likely range for CORR over the next 12 months, so sadly no rally back to higher levels for other longs and my (eventually formerly) stranded shares. But no question now about solvency and cash flow either, CORR will survive. Mixed bag for sure…."
"Almost 8.5% of the float is sold short (1.15M shares as of Jan 15th). Given the Crimson news, there is little reason to be short anymore as CORR is clearly solvent and profitable with the Crimson acquisition. Deal valued at $350M generating $50M+ in EBITDA, with CORR also having the profitable MoGas and Omega assets. Crimson's clients are investment grade with regulated revenue to CORR. Seems like this takes a huge amount of risk out of CORR's shares and adds a lot of value, smaller divvy notwithstanding. Looking forward to the call tomorrow."
Will the dividend eventually return to 0.75 a share? Thoughts??
"up 17% premarket today, GREAT JOB STIFEL!!!! ThANK YOU FOR CALLING THE BOTTOM"
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust is down 6.60% to 4.81
"Let's review recent events here:- Oil goes through a period of unprecedented volatility- During the volatility, one of CORR's tenants with a history of filing for CH 11 during volatility files for CH 11 -- 99% chance that lease gets renegotiated down some %age points and is paid at the newer negotiated rate when the company emerges (this has happened with this tenant before in recent history)- Also during that unprecented volatiility, one of CORR's larger tenants.. representing ~40% of revenue, says they need to hold off on payments for a month or two.. WHILE OIL PRICES ARE NEGATIVE... yes, ""sorry we can't afford to pay you right now because the main thing we produce has negative prices"".. pretty reasonable- About 1.5 months after that bigger tenant said they can't make rent in April, Oil went from $14 / barrel in April, to negative prices in May, and is now trading at around $40 in June.. and major stock indicies are making new highs....what do you think is going to happen here?? I was jacked OXY since last Friday, and CORR looks like an even stronger opportunitiy to me now based solely on the math of the sum of the parts. I'm Long."
"This company has $10.13 in cash, and the debt situation is not really a situation at all for CORR. The company could pay down 75% of total debt TODAY, in CASH if they wanted to without even diluting shareholders. So.. insolvency or any catastrophic event like that isn't really ont he table.. so continuing on..PP&E had carrying value of $109 MM on the last Q, and leased property was carried at $389 MM. And prior to COVID, investors were paying about a 65% premium on those assets at a $800 - $900 MM valuation.Even if thsee assets are to trade at a discount right now, which there is an argument for, it seems like we have overshot by a long way. Again.. looking at this in the most pessimistic way even, I can't wrap my head around this company being worth less than $300 MM, and even in a mildly optimistic scenario, closer to $450. Any value guys out there want to chime in?"
"It will be interesting to see if we get a bump from the 3 investor conferences this week for CORR, last one is Friday. I checked out the presentation from IR, nothing too new, other than a mention that GIGS litigation is on hold pending settlement negotiations. With $30M in past due rent, any resolution would be favorable to CORR's stock price, which seems to be pricing in the end of that asset. LOL!"
Who is selling shares? More informed investors? Before the news about Pinedale was released the stock was falling each day with movements uncorrelated to the oil price; I had a feeling somebody was constantly dumping shares.
"Wow, quickest call ever, exactly nine minutes. I didn't hear anything new, but there is some hope that Cox begins pumping oil again since prices have stabilized and CORR is pursuing their back rent in Court. David said they will be looking to an acquisition with the $100M+ they have to ""rebuild"" the business. No Q&A. Ho-hum CC......"
"Now that oil is approaching $40, Cox Oil should be reopening their wells. I have been saying in next 60 days, but I think it will be getting there soon. Cox represents 46% of revenue. When that happens we will see CORR at $25."
"CORR has now fallen 22 of the last 27 trading days. Amazing management. this is extremely hard to do, unless you are Enron"
"Where you at Tom? I listened to the whole investor call, it seems like management has decided to reduce their risk and increase it's market share. P66 in California is closing a refinery which will add more market share to CORR, too. This deal is robust and also helps to rectify the GIGS/ COX lease nonpayment issue. Not sure why the stock went up 11% then fell to below %5 at the moment. You're words of wisdom are welcome!"
"Held my nose and bought my last batch at $5.72. The ""no news"" has this dripping lower, but at some point the Cox issue will be resolved. One way or another and if Cox can't get their oil out without CORR, this is a different situation than Pinedale. Plus, with everyone cutting production and exploration (will XOM be the last shoe to drop?) oil should steady and even rise. Anyhoo, I can sit on this and be patient."
"Given that UPL has rejected the lease and will stop paying rent to CORR from 7/1, I’m surprised this is trading as well as it is. It’s up significantly from the trading halt where they released that news."
"Math plays on the long side. With 2 tenantsthe probability they both fail to pay the lease is 25%the probability one of the two fails is 50%the probability both resume paying is 25%In other words, there is 75% probability of a positive outcome for shareholders."
"Hey REDDIT users: Melvin Capital is short CORR, let's go get 'em! LOL! Seriously, the retail targeting of heavily shorted stocks is like nothing I have seen in my 30 years of investing/trading. Yes, I had GME at $4.30 from last spring, thought I was a genius for selling it at $28 for a 500% gain an look where it is now. Unreal!"
"WTI Crude Oil is now trading at $40.12. Should continue to trade going forward this summer in $40’s. Only a matter of time before Cox Oil reopen their wells. Remember, Cheescake Factory did the same thing by closing their restaurants and stopped paying rent. Same thing with Cox Oil, they will restart and start paying rent. Would have to believe CORR and Cox Oil will come to an agreement on back rent that suits them both. Legally, back rent is due and accrues. Expect to see CORR at $25 when Cox comes back online and reinstate at least 35-40% of dividend."
Have we reached peak pessimism? I think we're close. Looking to start a meaningful position.
There’s a lot of short sellers on this stock. If it pops a dollar it will really start to run when the squeeze hits
