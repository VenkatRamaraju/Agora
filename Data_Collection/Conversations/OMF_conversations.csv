I spent all remaining money in Schwab account on more shares at 55.10.
"On October 28, 2021, the offering and sale of 10,010,208 Shares by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter was completed.Also pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, on October 28, 2021, the Company purchased from the Underwriter 1,870,000 of the Shares that were sold by the Selling Stockholder in the offering, at a purchase price of $53.45 per share, which is equal to the price at which the Underwriter purchased the Shares from the Selling Stockholder, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $99.95 million (the “Concurrent Share Buyback”)."
The market's relatively low valuation of a finance company earning more than $9 a share suggests a perception that its earnings are unreliable. And Apollo's rush for the exit door is strange. Yet my review of the prospectus and other materials suggests plain vanilla credit risk. What am I missing here?
"I know it was discussed somewhere on the board, but I am pasting from today’s transcript on future dividends and buy backs.Doug Shulman -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerYes, I mean, let's let me give you just some thoughts on our capital return strategy. Just as you know, it's evolved over time. It was only two years ago, or two and a half years ago, we actually started returning capital to shareholders after we deleveraged very significantly, we started out with a $1, regular dividend, we then added specials, we've moved that dividend up, the regular dividend now, up to $2.80. We've always said that, we kind of modulate that around our stress tests and because we want to make sure even in a severely stressed environment, that we're able to pay that dividend. So and then we added buybacks at the beginning of this year and you saw we did about $140 million of buybacks in the quarter. So as you've seen, over time, we've put a lot more regularity and predictability into our capital return. And I think people should think about that regularity and predictability. That's the path that we're continuing on. We don't -- we can't give you an exact dividend versus buybacks. I do think we're going to continue to be a high yielding stock but buybacks are now part of our capital return strategy. And we anticipate it being part of our capital return strategy going forward."
"I was ok with earnings enough to participate in buying 500 more shares at $55.50. Really, that big a drop in share price with a slight earnings beat. What am I missing here? I am in this for the income play as I initially got in after exiting a REIT and then added after I sold half of an MLP position to reduce oil exposure. I realize there are some questions on future special dividends but even with just regular we are at 5% yield. Specials are gravy. How do you guys see the future here?"
What did Cramer just say about OMF. Is it too cheap? Only 4 times earnings? What’s wrong with it?
This goes to show that the strategy of special dividends and dilution has an overall highly negative effect on the stock. Management has little concern for shareholder value
Did Apollo have enough seats to influence the special dividend payments?
Apollo must be selling the XC#$ out of this but why? If I was to sell 10M shares I would do it very slowly as to not sell the stock to tatters. By keeping it around 55 a share over the long term would save them about 30 million.....doesn't make sense

"Okiedokie, Apollo will now be in our rear view mirror, a non-dilutive secondary has been issued covering their remaining 10+ million shares. $100 million worth of those shares will be purchased by OMF itself. That should be in the area of 2 million shares, which will reduce the shares outstanding and immediately increase the EPS. I’m very happy to have Apollo gone."
"Regarding Dividends: Per Doug Shulman, COB/CEO, ""We don't - we can't give you an exact dividend vs buybacks. I do think we're going to continue to be a high yielding stock but buybacks are now part of our capital return strategy. And we anticipate it being part of our capital return strategy going forward."" In the last 12 months, OMF has paid out $9.55 per share in regular and enhanced (special) dividends which equated to a yield of 16% based on share price prior to earnings announcement. Going forward, based on their new strategy, though yields as high as the mid-teens may not continue, it appears OMF Senior team is committed to still being a ""HIGH"" yielding stock."
"Apollo is gone. Some of the materials make it seem like Apollo-Varde will still have shares, but that is Varde’s chunk. Looks like they are retaining some ownership, which is fine. They no longer have the right to nominate board members!"
"Yahoo has the short term, mid term, and long term arrows down. We should be good to go."
CEO Schulman should come out and reassure everyone nothing is amiss. This is a real beatdown and needs to be addressed.
"Earnings Whisper number for OMF EPS is $2.37, 3% above consensus $2.30 per share ..."
Appolo sale price will be decided based on today’s closing price. They would suppress the price for obvious reasons.
"Bought another 1k shares @ 53.98, should have bought Fri. Per ER I think the special dividend and any increase will be at least late next year. But I do believe the stock will go up."
Ten year is getting crushed today and banks are getting slammed.
"I am long on OMF and have no plan to sell for years , I think it must be 5 o’clock somewhere. Time to start my weekend."
