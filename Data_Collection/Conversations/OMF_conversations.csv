"I believe Apollo agreed to a 30 day lockdown after the recent sale. I do not understand how they are being allowed to do an additional sale? If someone knows, please respond. I’ll be so glad when Apollo is gone."
How was the cc. Something negative must have been communicated.
Guessing alot of longer term owners are taking the big profit before sleepy Joe gets his capital gain tax increase.
Why is OMF down so much in after-hours trading? Only news I read was old news about the secondary offering with Apollo.
"FWIW, I couldn’t understand how they were doing a second secondary before the lock-up timeframe had expired. Someone much more knowledgeable than me explained it. The pledge is made to the person running the secondary, which was Barkley’s. That pledge is made so that the market won’t be flooded with shares from another secondary before they have time to shed the shares. But since Barkley is also running the added secondary, it’s ok so long as they agree with it, and apparently they have."
"AH one seller of almost 10,000 shares @59.30 only about 800 other shares have traded some at 60 others at 59.50 in that range."
So who thinks we will see the regular dividend raised to $1.00 next week?
If my math is correct Apollo Management will own about 17 million shares of OMF following a successful sale of its shares in coming days. Apollo will no longer be the dominant shareholder and it’s possible they will be gone entirely in six months or so. I am not sure what that means for OMF. Maybe nothing except for some new board members.
What did Cramer just say about OMF. Is it too cheap? Only 4 times earnings? What’s wrong with it?
This was filed todayhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001584207/000114036121027932/ny20000104x11_8k.htm
So happy the idiots sold me all their shares at almost 10% discount. Looking forward to dividends next 3 1/2 months and a return to 60. Close to $5 a share dividend in that time frame. Sell me more tomorrow please.
"Great management, for customers and shareholders ! Keep the faith and read their financials !The best is yet to come."
"James, I just want to get my $13000 losses back and get out of this trap OMF ASAP . when do You think it will be a good time to sell my stocks after getting my dividends to recover my losses? a week or weeks from now?"
"This quarter's results are disappointing, stock down 7+%. Revenue was projected at 878.71M, per yahoo analysis, and it came in at $876M. Not sure how management is going to spin this? Saving grace would be positive guidance for the next quarter."
"Been dead for too long on this board. My bold prediction is that the next run upwards will soon begin. Guessing some minor stock appreciation prior to earnings on 27th. Much stronger run upwards after earnings. I’m not predicting a special dividend in the $1 range, but if that should happen, this one might really rocket. The stock has traded as low as $23.41 today. Let’s see if I’m right or flat wrong over the next couple of months."
"Picked up 3 dividend stocks in early March. Wishing I had picked up 2 and increased my OMF holdings. Great company, great divvies!"
10/8/21 - Deutsche Bank initiates coverage on OMF as buy
When I buy most stocks I don’t care to know its net asset value. If anything I pay a multiple of the NAV. So why does the price of a stock usually fall by the amount of the dividend on the day it goes x-div? Is it just tradition or is it something else. OMF did fall from 61 to 57 yesterday morning and recovered some. This makes no sense to me.
"Question for long term investors of OMF. looks like the time to buy is before the Ex Dividend dates for the $4.20/$3.95 dividends and then sell after dividends are paid, knowing that the other dividend payouts are .40/.70 respectively. Would this be smart to go after other stocks that are paying higher dividends during OMF low quarters."
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8f328097-0f7b-30ea-ab2c-2dca375fe86f/2-stocks-to-buy-with.html
"Are the dividends paid by OMF classified as ""Qualified"" or ""Ordinary""? ""Qualified Dividends"" are taxed at capital gains rates 0%, 15% or 20%. ""Ordinary Dividends"" are taxed at higher ordinary income tax rates.Thanks for your time. I really appreciate it."
"One more comment about OMF special dividends that they pay in February and August IN ADDITION TO their regular quarterly dividend. If you selected to have dividends automatically reinvested with your brokerage firm, those special dividends WILL NOT be automatically reinvested, although the regular dividend WILL BE reinvested. I found that out when OMF first started the twice a year special dividend.So, if you want to reinvest those special dividends you will have to initiate a trade using the cash value of the special dividend once it is credited to your brokerage account on the dividend payment date."
"Excellent finish for OMF to close out the week, up a healthy 3.6%"
Is 4 dollars special distribution or regular dividends? Doe say special dividends? 16 d dividends for 22?
Anyone know when the next dividend payout is?
"Good earnings report! For those newer to the stock let me explain the special dividend. Once the dividend is paid, the price of the share opens at the previous day price less $4.20 per share. It is essentially a wash on the date it is paid. The benefit will come if the stock rises beyond the new share price. You all may know this, but thought it may be worth re-sharing. GLTA"
"So I have been wondering why Apollo Global Management and Varde (Swedish for value) Partners have been selling their 40+% stake on OMF which they acquired in 2018. I don’t think it was Apollo’s call. Based on what I read at Varde Partners website, it looks to me like Varde’s Minnesota-based, liberal, ESG guiding principles probably paid a significant part in the decision to part with OMF while making a profit. Take a look at their website. Tell me what you conclude.Were it not for Varde’s stated principles, my guess and for what it’s worth, Apollo would not be selling."
"sounds like the previous secondary share they did a month ago with Barclays .. no dilution.As before, if the stock stays down because sellers think this is diluation, then this should presents itself as a great buying opportunity of a lower stock price for all the wrong reasons"
All the banks are down after their earnings. Is the same holding true for OMF after their earnings tomorrow?
"Okiedokie, Apollo will now be in our rear view mirror, a non-dilutive secondary has been issued covering their remaining 10+ million shares. $100 million worth of those shares will be purchased by OMF itself. That should be in the area of 2 million shares, which will reduce the shares outstanding and immediately increase the EPS. I’m very happy to have Apollo gone."
"Individual investors hold just .08% of the outstanding shares. I wonder how many of us there are.If you have a long position in OMF, please click thumb up."
of course Cramer said it was too cheap...it should be 60 to 70 a share
I am in need of a financial planner to show me how to spend my new special dividend of $7140. Wow.
When we are @ $72 all these free shares are going to look even better.
A big thank you to all the ill-informed panic sellers today. I've been waiting for this dip since late February. Bring it down a bit more so I can add on the cheap.

Told y’all yahoo turned all three arrows down and up the stock goes. I have been doing all this silly DD and all I needed to do was the opposite of yahoo arrows and Cramer’s advices.
PE ratio and dividend is awesome. Financial stocks fixin to boom as interest rates climb incrementally over next 5 years as economy and inflation rise upward. Excellent value stock!
Everyone who is fatigued by making money should sell me their shares in OMF.
How can this stock be in the red after the knock out earnings report yesterday? It should climb as it approached ex div date of Aug 2.
"Sold OMF at $47.18 for a very nice profit of just over $5.2k. This one worked out nicely. Nothing huge, but a really nice earnings report accompanied by a really nice pop to the upside in stock price. Immediately jumped into NMIH, long 2400 shares at $34.48. Got a really nice fill price just before 12:00 Noon. Stock was trending higher later in the day, but then sold off a bit on the ER, which looks very solid to me. Very low AH volume, and the stock is coming back up now. I think NMIH should be going up tomorrow during the early regular session and I'm confident I can get out with at least some profit tomorrow. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
"I don’t understand this stock. In the last week their have been 8 or 10 articles all calling OMF a buy. It continues to drop on low volume. Last night there was a 200,000 trade at the closing price. I have held OMF for over a year. I am still ahead on the price, but this should be going up."
"I am long on OMF and have no plan to sell for years , I think it must be 5 o’clock somewhere. Time to start my weekend."
"Before anyone gets nervous, yes on Aug. 3 Apollo sold 10M shares to Barclays at $58 and change, pursuant to an underwriting agmt. They still own 25M. Let me know if you need the link to the SEC filing 13G."
"pretty much the expected, dont think there is going to be much of a reaction tbh"
Question. Does this company pay dividends each quarter ??
"If you have dry powder, QYLD has 11.8% yield and pays monthly dividends. The 52-week range is just 3 points. Don't sell OMF though."
Ten year is getting crushed today and banks are getting slammed.
Bought a few hundred at 56.97 
"Zacks current stock ratings carries a Strong Buy (1) and their Value, Growth & Momentum or VGM is graded at A. Doesn't get any better"
CEO Schulman should come out and reassure everyone nothing is amiss. This is a real beatdown and needs to be addressed.
This goes to show that the strategy of special dividends and dilution has an overall highly negative effect on the stock. Management has little concern for shareholder value
The market's relatively low valuation of a finance company earning more than $9 a share suggests a perception that its earnings are unreliable. And Apollo's rush for the exit door is strange. Yet my review of the prospectus and other materials suggests plain vanilla credit risk. What am I missing here?
"Folks, if you don’t like the Q2 report then you don’t need to be in the stock market. I have nothing but the highest praise for this company and it’s management team. Thank you very much for this special dividend of $2 per share. It doesn’t get much better than this."
WHY!?
Did Apollo have enough seats to influence the special dividend payments?
imagine if their earnings were terrible
Now Zack's rank #1https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-ranked-value-stocks-buy-135301715.html
Apollo seems to be selling 10M of its 28M shares. Not goodbeye yet I think. Is this not correct?
So the Apollo / Barclays 7 to 8 million shares have a maximum offering price of $58.13 per the prospectus. It could take several days to sell these shares to investors so I don’t see a price run up beginning immediately (until Barclays sells its shares). Then look for the share price to climb up to around $62 again. I am considering buying some more shares here at $57-58 and selling these shares before Apollo announced it is selling another 8 million shares. A high wire act you say.
"Sometimes I like to look far off into the future to see where an investment could potentially go. As OMF prepares to launch a credit card by 2022, it makes me look at Capital One (COF) which has a market cap of $76B compared to OMF market cap of $7.6B... I like what that represents in future potential while collecting a minimum dividend of $2.80 per share and probably significantly higher dividend given historic dividends. Seems like a great investment to me."
"Earnings Whisper number for OMF EPS is $2.37, 3% above consensus $2.30 per share ..."
going fly new high when announced revenues today
"When you see Goldman, BOA, and other traders making huge profits the SP runup/ selloff is an example of how they play the game."
Is selling over?
I spent all remaining money in Schwab account on more shares at 55.10.
"I’m not saying it will, but I’d love to see it establish $59 as a base before the earnings report. That would set us up well for a move back into the $60’s if the earnings beat expectations."
"My next Pure Earnings play is going to be OMF. Sometime later today I will cover my EPC Short Sell, hopefully for a very nice profit, and going Long OMF. Why OMF?? OMF Long: Excellent earnings history, excellent stock price reactions to ER's, current stock price indicating absolute under-valuation based upon a comprehensive financial analysis. Analysts are generally bullish, offering very good upside potential on PT's. Overall financial situation of company is excellent. Play offers excellent upside potential of 4-7% with very limited downside risk. A safe play for a bull market with many USA consumers having extra cash to spend at their discretion. Upside potential is not quite as high as I would like, but I vary my plays on this parameter. Sometimes I place more value on limiting risk, other times I place more value on upside potential. Later this week, if I choose to go with my TRIP Short Sell, that will be a play where I go to the other side, choosing higher risk in exchange for what I perceive to be higher upside potential. Please note that all Pure Earnings plays are very dangerous. You could easily lose 10-20+% of your traded balance, within a single day. The only good news is, you could also gain a similar percentage. But always anticipate the loss, and make your Go decision only if you can genuinely smile upon cashing out with a 20% loss. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
Not bad sold after ex dividend date made 230 bucks plus got dividend. Easy 2000
Doubled down at 54.5.
"Please read the cut and paste information below. Apollo owns so much of OMF that they can’t just sell it. They have to publish and underwrite.There are no (zip,zilch,zero) NEW shares.The reason I care is that thanks to someone else on the board explaining this last time, I was able to buy shares at $53 a few months ago and am trying to pay it forward to others looking to this board. From business wire: OneMain Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: OMF) (the ""Company"") announced today the pricing of its previously-announced underwritten public offering of 9.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock (the ""base offering"") by an entity managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the ""selling stockholder""). The base offering has been upsized from 8.0 million to 9.5 million shares of Company common stock, which represents approximately 7% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of July 15, 2021. The Company is not selling any shares and will not receive any proceeds from the proposed offering. The offering is expected to close on August 3, 2021, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.In addition, the Company has agreed to purchase 1.7 million shares of common stock that are the subject of the base offering at a price per share equal to the price at which the underwriter will purchase such shares from the selling stockholder in the offering (the ""Concurrent Share Buyback""). The Concurrent Share Buyback has been upsized from 1.6 million to 1.7 million shares. The Concurrent Share Buyback is contingent on, and expected to occur simultaneously with, the closing of the base offering. The Company intends to fund the Concurrent Share Buyback from existing cash on hand. The underwriter will not receive any compensation for the shares being repurchased by the Company."
What y’all think about the tax on stock buy backs
"This is in further response to Jake’s earlier inquiry as to the future dividends and buy backs. I listened carefully to the parts of Tuesday’s presentation. Doug clearly says that for the near future we will see the three pronged approach, meaning standard dividends, specials, and share buybacks. This year the standard will generate about $370 M, the specials about $925 M. From memory we had $150 M budgeted for buybacks and they did the added one million share buy back which added another $55 M, so let’s call that $205 M in total. So the total rerun is about $1.5 B if my math is right. I thought Doug was coy about how that will be spread out in the future and as he should, said it would be a board decision. My hope would be that the standard dividend would be as high as possible, while being sure that they can meet the requirements going forward, because nothing hurts share prices worse than a standard dividend reduction. I’d love to see them raised se that payout to $500 M, that would be a standard dividend of about $3.80. That would leave a full 1 billion to be split between specials and buy backs. Sure would be easy to say, let’s put $500 M in each prong, lol. That’s my position, and I’m sticking to it. I’ve been short term neutral for a while. I’m going back to bullish because I think the presentation was great and I believer this manage team can produce and the credit cards will enhance revenue growth."
"Apollo is gone. Some of the materials make it seem like Apollo-Varde will still have shares, but that is Varde’s chunk. Looks like they are retaining some ownership, which is fine. They no longer have the right to nominate board members!"

"OMF will be presenting at the Barclays Investment Conference Tuesday Sep 14, maybe we will get a further bounce? They obviously have a good story to tell and maybe learn more in the credit card side?"
I bought 45 shares a few months ago a little nervous since I'm in for the dividend. But what is going on???? I just bought 120 shares. This is soo under the radar.
How was the presentation?
This investment is so much better than jepi.
It's nice to see above pre-Covid levels.
"Thank you to the board for quickly explaining that the share announcement was non dilutive so that I could safely count on value here. I have had OMF on my high yield watch list for some time now. I feel super lucky. I had bought a REIT for dividend yield in February 2020, but it was crushed by COVID. Yesterday, that REIT announced a merger so I quickly sold it and locked in a 15% LT gain. With those proceeds, I threw a limit buy order at OMF for $53 to lock in a 14% dividend yield. I was happy with the yield and now share price is up too. Better to be lucky than good I guess."

Baby is going places! The offering is no biggie. - OMF raised the dividend- had a great earnings report - special dividend twice a year - the offer won’t dilute the free float - just buy more or hold your position 70+ by end of May!
Got it in email
"This news about Apollo selling 6 or 7 million shares of OMF is most timely. Now with the irrational share price drop today on that news, our $4.20 per share dividend payable tomorrow, August 13, will buy more shares of OMF! Then, onward and upward marches the price of OMF!"
Ignore the posts from these fake options traders. They want you to sell your shares and drive the price down so they can buy at a cheaper price. OMF is $59 after hours!
This is just rebalancing of Apollo's portfolio.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/onemain-holdings-inc-announces-proposed-202500575.html
"OMF could easily be in the 40s by next week, IMO."
"The constant ""things"" that Apollo does in this stock cause a lot of confusion. I am a believer in the stock, but we all need to keep our eyes on Apollo."
"Will OMF be challenged by the “buy now, pay later” lenders. OMF describes its customers as “near prime.” Is not this the same as buy now and pay later?Also, the recent presentation the ceo indicated that the special dividend is likely to decline. My interpretation is the special dividend was used to pump up the share price for it number one shareholder."
Whisper remains at $2.45 but the “consensus” suddenly jumped to $2.22 from $2.07.Looks like nice weather today.
Nice action today!
I purchased yesterday at 55.10. Looking good today.
so if its going to payout 2.33 a share and i buy 400 shares I would make 2.33 X 400 = $932 am i calculating that correctly or is it not that simple?
Became a shareholder yesterday. Can’t believe how much this business has improved over the last five years. Insanely profitable with opportunity for lower funding costs. Can’t wait for Apollo-Varde to get off the board too.
Magnificent report and a brand new $2 special dividend for a net payout of $2.33. This baby should pop big tomorrow and straight through to ex-dividend day. Congrats Management Team. Attaboy Apollo too!
"Apollo is only selling slightly under one fifth of their position, as they own a whopping total of more than 43 million shares of OMF. No wonder they're selling some. Just thinking out loud, I believe it's a positive that they're selling a ""few"" of their shares (around 440M worth), as you don't want companies to have too much control. I believe we could also see a rise in the PPS as a result of this. I checked and the institutional ownership percentage is relatively high with OMF. My brokerage account claims it's 95%, while Nasdaq shows around 86%. Based on the filing, it looks like different prices can and will be negotiated, so could be lower, higher, or market prices. Just looking at the ridiculously low valuation, and considering institutional investors wouldn't get many shares on the open market without skyrocketing the PPS, we all shouldn't be surprised to see the stock do well as shares are bought up from Apollo. Could I be wrong? Sure, but we're not talking about a high float stock with little interest, and an overpriced valuation. Entities will want in, and possibly big, and this is their perfect opportunity to do so. As Apollo tries to sell 440M in stock, give or take, we also shouldn't forget that OMF just announced a 150M share buyback which could come into play."
"In case anyone wondering, earnings release after close today and conference call tomorrow morning. I just wish that I had bought more shares on Monday. GLTA."
Why is this #$%$ going down to the bottom after paying the dividend?
Why is the stock tanking?!
"I was ok with earnings enough to participate in buying 500 more shares at $55.50. Really, that big a drop in share price with a slight earnings beat. What am I missing here? I am in this for the income play as I initially got in after exiting a REIT and then added after I sold half of an MLP position to reduce oil exposure. I realize there are some questions on future special dividends but even with just regular we are at 5% yield. Specials are gravy. How do you guys see the future here?"
"Question on options trading today: The strike prices of 55, 60, and 65 for puts and calls for all expiration dates are showing 0. In addition, 0 is being shown for numerous other strike prices and expiration dates. Does anyone know the reason for this? I own strike 55 puts for September and there is no price. Thanks for any advice on this."
"Watching the action today, early rise, sharp drop, quick recovery, then trading in a narrow band with a slight gain made me pause to think. What I nearly know is the case is that Apollo is heading out. But it’s the big boys that are buying the 9.5 million shares that Apollo sold plus the under-writer allotment of another 1.4 million shares. They clearly had their eye on the $4.20 dividend, which they will own on Thursday. So with power brokers owning either new or bigger stakes going forward, what should we expect? Factor in that OMF bought in another 1.7 million shares and have plenty of allocated dollars to continue buying in shares. You stack that up, and to me the runway to growth in share prices is as bright as it has ever been. When you have powerful forces owning large holdings in a Company who is buying back their own stick and hitting on all 8 cylinders, and who will have a brand new revenue in credit cards by year-end, what more could existing shareholders ask for? I don’t know if the growth will be immediate, but absent some type of Covid disaster, you couldn’t make me sell a share of this stock. I’m as bullish as I have ever been."
"OMF paid dividend of $3.95 after close on Feb 16, 2021. So the price per share dropped exactly $3.95 per share from $53.79 to $49.84 at the close. Most of the price drop today (Feb 17, 2021) reflects that dividend, which is payable to investors next Thursday, Feb 25, 2021."
Full disclosure -- just took advantage of the after hours drop -- bought 400 shares at $58.30 ( $1.40 less than closing price) on this rebalance
"If it hasn't been announced yet and I missed the news somewhere, ""Brightway"" should be the next catalyst based on some simple searches on Google."
"Just out of curiosity I’d like to do a poll of shareholders in this board. First off, let’s set aside the regular $2.80 dividend, and only consider the historic special dividends. Second let’s recognize that there is a buy-back program in place, and that the current outstanding share count is about 132 million shares. Third, let’s recognize that Apollo was by far the dominant shareholder, and arguably they had significant input in the special dividend decisions, but their shareholding’s have now dropped significantly. Fourth, while many on this conversation board may hold OMF in an IRA, we are small potatoes as the institutes own a huge majority of the shares. Fifth, the tax implications on the $7 of special dividends means they have paid out about $925 M in just special dividends this year, which requires income taxes to be paid by most shareholders. Finally, let’s recognize that very few stocks pay a “special” dividend. Here’s my question: If management decided to use the $924 M as an additive funding to existing share buy-backs rather than awarding special dividends, do you believe that would be a good thing in general for the broad base of shareholders? Please press thumbs up for yes, and thumbs down for no. Obviously any comments in support of your choice would be great."
im trying to figure out what the catch is to me buying right before the ex date? according to what i have learned the stock should drop after that date to offset my profits that i will be getting from the dividend but it looks like the stock could easily rebound and i make double profits from dividend and stock potentially rising
Nice article on Seeking Alpha today. Might be of interest to anyone thinking about investing in this sec...
"Crazy stock, wanted to buy at $56 after divident. Nope. Wanted to buy now after dillution. Nope. Pfff"
"The updated prospectus showing 9.5 million before added shares for the secondary has been posted along with pricing. It shows that after the deal is concluded Apollo will be down to 25.6 million shares and will no longer meet the 20% BOD significant control threshold. The pricing is at $60.29 which I think is very bullish given that huge secondary offerings receive large discounts. Jake, as I was responding to your earlier post I had not seen the updated prospectus. See page S-10 for the share count info. I’m back to very bullish."
Apollo must be selling the XC#$ out of this but why? If I was to sell 10M shares I would do it very slowly as to not sell the stock to tatters. By keeping it around 55 a share over the long term would save them about 30 million.....doesn't make sense
own it by Friday for 70 cent div.
"Ex div is Monday. We will probably drop by a buck or so that day, but that is just the way that this stock rolls."
"Looking at possibly investing in OMF, could someone please clarify the following - understanding that the dividend will be going up 56% to $0.70 per quarter, will management look to continue to pay the special semi-annual dividend on top of the increase?"
"Blowout quarter, increased dividend 56% and 150 million stock repurchase which will drive the price higher. So happy I bought shares in this company"
"I know it was discussed somewhere on the board, but I am pasting from today’s transcript on future dividends and buy backs.Doug Shulman -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerYes, I mean, let's let me give you just some thoughts on our capital return strategy. Just as you know, it's evolved over time. It was only two years ago, or two and a half years ago, we actually started returning capital to shareholders after we deleveraged very significantly, we started out with a $1, regular dividend, we then added specials, we've moved that dividend up, the regular dividend now, up to $2.80. We've always said that, we kind of modulate that around our stress tests and because we want to make sure even in a severely stressed environment, that we're able to pay that dividend. So and then we added buybacks at the beginning of this year and you saw we did about $140 million of buybacks in the quarter. So as you've seen, over time, we've put a lot more regularity and predictability into our capital return. And I think people should think about that regularity and predictability. That's the path that we're continuing on. We don't -- we can't give you an exact dividend versus buybacks. I do think we're going to continue to be a high yielding stock but buybacks are now part of our capital return strategy. And we anticipate it being part of our capital return strategy going forward."
Earnings out?
Average PT for five analysts post earnings report is now $74.

"I just discovered this hidden gem. WOW! Company was founded in 1920. Impressive. I do have one point of curiosity, though. According to their YAHOO charts, it didn't start paying dividends until 2019. That does not alarm me, but it is curious."
OMF making credit card?
"Unless I missed a post, Lobo was the winner of the special dividend amount contest. His guess was $3.30. Congratulations Lobo, you had the best perspective!"
"Actually, I don't care if the stock moves up. With my current investment, I am getting more than 17% in dividends. Planning to hold for a while (or forever as long as annual dividend payout is over 12%)."
"Can anyone from OMF attempt to provide a sensible reason why we just suffered a 8% drop today, on the same day the earnings call was very optimistic?Very , dry disappointing"
EASY money!
"I finally took today as an entry point. Not the entry point that I wanted, but I ent in for 1,000 shares @ $58.74. I am optimistic, rightly or wrongly."
"Why the drop today?After a strong opening, why the drop in SP. Does this mean another secondary is to be announced and leaked to insiders first, as I see no SEC document ?"
"On October 28, 2021, the offering and sale of 10,010,208 Shares by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter was completed.Also pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, on October 28, 2021, the Company purchased from the Underwriter 1,870,000 of the Shares that were sold by the Selling Stockholder in the offering, at a purchase price of $53.45 per share, which is equal to the price at which the Underwriter purchased the Shares from the Selling Stockholder, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $99.95 million (the “Concurrent Share Buyback”)."
13 days in front of earning a $4.20 per share dividend....... people actually SELL? Lunacy!
"Regarding Dividends: Per Doug Shulman, COB/CEO, ""We don't - we can't give you an exact dividend vs buybacks. I do think we're going to continue to be a high yielding stock but buybacks are now part of our capital return strategy. And we anticipate it being part of our capital return strategy going forward."" In the last 12 months, OMF has paid out $9.55 per share in regular and enhanced (special) dividends which equated to a yield of 16% based on share price prior to earnings announcement. Going forward, based on their new strategy, though yields as high as the mid-teens may not continue, it appears OMF Senior team is committed to still being a ""HIGH"" yielding stock."
"Relax folks, the dividend in Feb 2022 will be around $4 and the shareprice at that time will be back in the low 60's."
Can someone explain to me what good is a special dividend when the stock price is later discounted by the same amount. I don’t understand the exuberance here.
"Yahoo has the short term, mid term, and long term arrows down. We should be good to go."
All banks had a bad day due to the 2 year 10 spread flatting. Nothing has changed buy all you can.
$OMF Target Raised by Stephens & Co. Overweight USD 75 » USD 87Target Lowered by BMO Capital Markets Market Perform USD 65 » 60
The next special dividend for this stock will be around August 10 and will pay between $3.50 and $4.00 per share.
"What are OMF holders supposed to conclude from data showing that consumers have dramatically reduced their credit card balances? Does that mean there will be reduced demand for OMF credit products? This is a genuine question. I'm long. OMF is well run, and mgmt interests are aligned with shareholders, so this thing could take off and run to 80. Or slide to 40."
What am I missing here? These shares should be flying off the shelves.Consensus is $2.04.......annualized that’s $8.16 making the PE 6.52.Thought?
Wells Fargo posted div this am. Not e*t or Schwab...
"Stephens & Co (maintains).: OMF to Overweight 10/22/21, price target 87."
"A pure income stock going UP between x-dividend date and distribution date makes zero sense, but I will take it."
"Ok so any gurus savy on the Level 2 tape? There are loads of transactions going thru today for between 55.50 and 55.65, the transactions are in a gray background with black font instead of the typical black background with red and green fonts. Would it be correct to assume these are the Apollo shares? I’m seeing the same thing on STEM today and they recently announced conversion of their warrants to shares."
Crashing into the close. Buy at the close.
The dividend patten is interestingly erratic. Why?
To me this smells like manipulation before the dividend is payed.No logical reason for this otherwise.
"Long 1700 shares of OMF at $44.10. This is a Pure Earnings play, and so far it is looking very good. The ER was VERY good, large beats on both EPS and Revenue. The stock has reacted very well here in the AH session, and I see no reason to think this will turn Red tomorrow. We should see more buyers coming in, pushing this further up. I am looking for a high of day around $50 tomorrow. But of course anything is possible, and you should keep in mind that this prediction comes from someone (me), who just lost twenty-three thousand dollars on a single trade in a single day. (today) !! :-) Sometime tomorrow, I will be selling all my OMF shares, and then my plan is to immediately jump into NMIH as my next Pure Earnings play. This stock is looking VERY good to me, it scores 23 out of 24 points on my comprehensive analysis, which is very, very high. There are a bunch of very good-looking plays on this date, including LAD, CYBR, CVS, CVE, and AKAM. They all look real nice to me for an upside pop, but NMIH looks the best and so I will be going with her. :-) Always do your own Due Diligence in deciding what stocks to buy or Sell Short, and if you are tempted to just follow someone else, I might not be the best choice, because, to repeat, I LOST twenty-three thousand dollars shorting a razor blade stock, TODAY. :-) ""Warning, Danger Will Robinson, Danger. Warning!"""
"Wow, I decided to buy after div but my order did not execute today, good for you guys!"
Hold for 10 days and made 2000 yummy
"I'm trying to understand this stock. Since a strong run up a few days ago, it's dropping everyday, despite being a profitable company with high ratings. It seems like more investors are selling than buying, but why?"
August 13Th paydate
OMF moved up to Zack's #1 rating ...
worst 2 days in a year
"Let’s have a contest to see who gets closest to the size of the special dividend, do not include the regular dividend in your guess. I’ll start it off, my guess is $2.50."
"Annual dividends will be at a minimum of $5.60 while the stock is now near its 2021 low of $55. What is not to like about a 10%+ return?? BUY, BUY, BUY!!"
"Note that this closes on Oct 38, so OMF saves the 70 cent dividend also, yea relatively chicken feed, but more in our coffers."
new $2.80 annual dividend plus $2.00-$4.00 special dividend provides 9-12% dividend rate plus capital gains is all gravy.
I don’t see this as any problem. I have been buying at 60 to 60.5 for the last few days. Out of power in my investment account. Thinking about transferring $ but not sure I need to continue buying. What do you folks think it will go down to after x date.
"Home Run. $3.95 dividend, adjusted earnings $2.77 beats expectations by 35%. Also beats on revenues. I luv this company, they just keep beating."
"Bought another 1k shares @ 53.98, should have bought Fri. Per ER I think the special dividend and any increase will be at least late next year. But I do believe the stock will go up."
"I invested here for dividends and moderate growth, but this volatility is killing it for me."
"As a retail investor, I understand the desire for stock re-purchase...... BUT I find them to be much more difficult to quantify than dividend distribution. Yeah..... I like to keep things simple. My holdings in OMF are in my IRA. Thus........ gains are simple to quantify. Love this holding!!!!"
"This is posted just to get some input from experienced investors. OMF is my biggest holding. Owned it well before the special dividends began. But it’s also the first stock I’ve owned that is paying these large special dividends. My thought is that since Apollo is owning them and constantly demanding cash, that to a large degree we can expect large special dividends twice a year, I think that was confirmed in their last conference call. So, what do y’all think we should expect as an annual total dividend? Obviously the standard $1.32 should be safe. Thus far, since it began them, the lowest single special dividend was $2, or an added $4 annualized. Do you believe we should accordingly expect an annual total dividend of at least $5.32? If so, should this move back into the upper $40’s or even $50’s within the next year? If that logic is flawed, what do you believe is the right assumption to make on forward dividends? Any input appreciated."
Some people hit a COMPLETE WINNER during the heart of the pandemic when they bought this stock. Based on today's divi IF you bought it back then that's a yield of 45%. Wish I saw that and took action....
Earnings report was decent. Why the Huge Downdraft in the stock?!
"Did not drop div amount, it must be love."
Are special dividends here to stay?
"At age 71, if this pricing reaction continues given these great earnings, the guidance, and a knockout dividend, then it tells me it’s time to retire from investing."
the key is that they grew receivables 4% q/q and launched the CC. expenses were about in line with last quarter (adjusted) and the loan loss provision is mostly noise. incrementally positive quarter.
Appolo sale price will be decided based on today’s closing price. They would suppress the price for obvious reasons.
Awesome report! Huge dividend of $4.20 payable on August 13. Knocked it out of the park. This should see $65 easy tomorrow!
