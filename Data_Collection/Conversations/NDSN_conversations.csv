Nordson just let go about 20 employees from the GBS (Global Business Systems). GBS was formed less than 2 years ago. It was some VPs brain child to replace all the support groups that were comprised of older employees. Only problem is they hired young people off the street with no experience so that they can pay them entry level salaries and no pensions. Guess that didn’t work. Now they’re reorganizing GBS. SMH
"To all the ""GOD COMPLEX"" managers.......GBS stands for "" GOOD BYE SUCKER"", do it your damn self...I'M GONE."
