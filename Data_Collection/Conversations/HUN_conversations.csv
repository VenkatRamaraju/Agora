"Wintershall Dea, which is Germany's largest oil and natural gas producer is 66% owned by #BASFY, the largest chemical company in the world. They own 72% taking to account preferred shares. #HUN, just drastically raised product prices because of gas cost. #BASFY, Wintershall is one of #BASFY divisions biggest revenue earners. They and their partner were going to IPO the company this quarter, but put the brakes on it. Do your own due diligence, but this is what competent management does - pulling IPO as future gas pricing could go a lot higher."
Clariant reported that they will be passing through all of their raw material price increases to their customers.Bloomberg
"Starboard - this from Forbes in 2014:The most feared man in corporate America these days is not named Icahn, Ackman, Loeb, or Einhorn, but rather Smith, as in Jeff Smith, the boyish-looking 42-year-old co-founder and CEO of a previously obscure $3 billion activist hedge fund called Starboard Value. In October, Smith accomplished something that even his more flamboyant, better-known activist peers can’t boast about: He took effective control of a Fortune 500 company—Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, which ranked No. 319, with some $8.5 billion in sales last year—while owning less than 10% of the company. Thanks to his success in running a highly contested proxy contest, Smith replaced the entire 12-member board of directors and assumed the role of chairman. Along with his handpicked board, he will soon choose a new CEO to run Darden. Welcome to the new world of corporate takeovers."

"Huntsman #HUN raises plastic ingredient prices Euro $125/ton due to gas increases. #BASF produces 80% of all their own power needs. #BASF, will, I'm sure increase their wholesale prices in line with Huntsman, without incurring but 20% of the nat gas cost. You like #HUN, you'll love #BASFY. gl."
"Starboard CEO out yesterday talking about their recent moves. In regard to HUN he mentioned these highlights:1. Their assets are “irreplaceable” - he called them a moat2. They moved up the value chain away from some commodities and into higher margin products3. They should have much better EBITDA margins than they do - more like 18%4. He said their revenue growth could exceed 5%5. He called it a “compelling investment”He then went on to generally speak about CEOs (he is an activist investor after all) and how the good ones will push to better levels and improvements through Covid, while others might be satisfied with just holding their heads above water.He will be meeting with Huntsman management next week, but did not say if any specific management changes would be suggested."
"DuPont (DD), Celanese (CE) and Huntsman (HUN) are among chemicals companies capable of ""significant"" Q3 earnings beats in an industry challenged by rising costs, KeyBanc said in a research note Monday.Those companies have greater exposure to the auto, electronics and construction markets, ""where a nascent demand rebound and healthy pricing power outweigh the risks of higher costs, KeyBanc analysts said.""However, for many other downstream/specialty companies, the moment when price catches up with costs is likely now further out into 2022, the firm said. ""Overall, we're dialing down risk a notch as the risks from the global energy crunch are far from apparent yet.""MTNewswires"
Jeff Smith will turn this around..................
"Tried to copy a good summary of some more from Wikipedia, but Yahoo swatted me away.From Symantec right through PaPa John’s. Check their 13f filing and you can see just what they still hold. One article cited mentioned that they’ve improved the share price of some 84% of companies where they’ve taken an active interest.It seems they’re here for more than just the smoothies and granola at the Annual Meeting…"

Sold off at end of day to zero out call options
HUN is one of my boring stocks. Has a great chart and terrific fundamentals. I still have to force myself not to sell it. Snoozer but safe.
"Will HUN be able to parlay being a producer of barium sulfate into profits based on the new whilte paint that was just developed at Purdue University that has amazing radiant cooling properties? And, will HUN be able to commercialize its new process to convert normally-flared methane gas into carbon fibers and pure hydrogen? Think of the huge size of the total-addressable-market (TAM) for each of these. We should discuss the implications of each in this forum."
