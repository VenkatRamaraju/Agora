"really strong earnings, balance sheet looks alright. overall decent stock"
Huntsman is up 6.95% to 15.31
Again really bad investment by Peter Huntsman and the board.Investors get nothing and they sell 42.5 million at 2.15. Thanks Peter keep the boys club going and don’t worry about stockholders.We got nothing out of you poor decisions. Own up.

Be patient Grasshopper . It is just consolidating at this level it will get moving north real soon.
"Wintershall Dea, which is Germany's largest oil and natural gas producer is 66% owned by #BASFY, the largest chemical company in the world. They own 72% taking to account preferred shares. #HUN, just drastically raised product prices because of gas cost. #BASFY, Wintershall is one of #BASFY divisions biggest revenue earners. They and their partner were going to IPO the company this quarter, but put the brakes on it. Do your own due diligence, but this is what competent management does - pulling IPO as future gas pricing could go a lot higher."
Someone pleaseAcquire huntsman already
the usual morning sell down before the PM advance. Seems to be an everyday thing.

"Wow, great earnings and the stock goes down ? Anyone here own VNTR ? Td showing that it's selling at under 7X earnings? Peter mentioned in the CC that HUN isn't selling any shares, and Peter himself is purchasing shares personally. May be a good time to throw some money at it."
HUN beats on both EPS and revenue:EPS of $0.86 vs $0.80 estimate (+7.5%)Revenue $2.02 billion vs $1.86 billion estimate (+8.8%)Benziga
the good news just keeps on coming. See the news section.
Hun killed it. Huge earnings beat. This is going to be a great day!!!
It’s a buy. They are on a roll. Nice dividend and big buyback already in place. Disregard the noise.
Huntsman needs a new leader. Peter has not performed. I agree with the other reply that this company needs sold.
Huntsman advanced materials is laying people off and has no sales. And the stock is steadily going up. This is crazy times!!
"While HUN and Chemical sector in general have problems, stocks behavior, coupled with its high beta, suggest a larger macro problem or two for the overall market. Dems take control of House, maybe even Senate, and underestimating Chinese resolve and discipline , which is far superior to US."

HUN bounced off this level back in April. We'll see if it does it again here.
Doubling down today.

HUN reached a new All Time High at 34.58
"Will HUN be able to parlay being a producer of barium sulfate into profits based on the new whilte paint that was just developed at Purdue University that has amazing radiant cooling properties? And, will HUN be able to commercialize its new process to convert normally-flared methane gas into carbon fibers and pure hydrogen? Think of the huge size of the total-addressable-market (TAM) for each of these. We should discuss the implications of each in this forum."
"This company doesn't appear to be too efficiently run.Their sales and administrative expenses seem high compared to other specialty chemical firms in the $7-10 billion revenue range. Last year their SGA expenses were 9.5% of revenue, compared to an average of 6.3% for 4 other firms that I reviewed. This inefficiency is hurting their operating margin and lowering the valuation of the firm. I think the stock would be 50% higher if they could get their operating margin up 2-3 percent. Reducing their bloated SGA expenses would be the way to do it."
Way to run the business Peter!!! There’s a lemonade stand for sale nearby. Maybe they could use your business savvy!!!
"Dudes are up after hours bigly, why?"
Just a question. Long time holder of this company back in 2005. Peter has not increased shareholder value since he took over in early 2000’s. Boy club should end and start looking after shareholders.
HUN is one of my boring stocks. Has a great chart and terrific fundamentals. I still have to force myself not to sell it. Snoozer but safe.
"Hun has been going up when market is going down. , Ex dividend I think soon. Nice to see this rising . Thought last earnings were good and I like the dividend"
Maybe they should put the company up for sale. Question is would there be any interest.

"Have to hand it to Huntsman, great job dumping the VNTR shares out into the open market, instead of giving loyal shareholders who sat through the TIO2 debacle for years waiting for a payoff, instead they spin off the TI portion of the company, then tank it, and shareholders get nothing."

"Here is what I found...""The only thing I found is from Citigroup. Downgraded HUN last week to Neutral and cut the price target from 43 to 30. Higher raw material costs, weaker diphenylmethane diisocynate demand conditions (if you know what that is) emerging in China with not much earnings growth expected next year. They also cited a lack of near-term catalysts for the next few quarters “in the backdrop of a well-telegraphed normalization in MDI profits.”"

Great buying opportunity here. tripling down.
could retest 29.20 before the next leg up. With a PE of 6 and the economy hitting on all cylinders I think it'll be moving up real soon.
14 years and HUN is almost at its IPO price! Good job guys!!
It will never hold a gain today.

"Maybe they they should sell this company, the share price was the same years ago. Doesn't seem to be any path to growth or shareholder return beyond the dividend. Several management fumbles. They probably get stock options for a discount or free and sell them . Buying shares with your own money as a buy and hold has been a disaster. Stock was higher a decade ago"

Seaport Global moves HUN from Neutral to Buy with a $35 price target...
"Huntsman really hung an albatross around the necks of HUN shareholders with this merger. Huntsman stock is in a free fall because it is now tied to Clariant stock. When the merger is complete Huntsman stock will cease to exist and Huntsman shareholders will each get 1.21 shares of Huntsman/Clariant stock. This is basically a 20% premium over Clariant which means we should expect Huntsman to bottom around $24.00 , which is a 20% premium over what Clariant is trading for. Based on forward EBITDA Huntsman should valued at about a 40% premium over Clariant. This merger also should never have been nogotiated before the Venator spin. Huntsmans would have been much stronger after the Venator spin and now with the merger with Clarion, Hunstman will not get to see what value the spin gives and Huntsman shareholders will never see any benefit from it. At this point there is no point or benefit too HUN shareholders by spinning Venator. Instead Hunstman decides to get in bed with a dog with fleas (Clariant) and Huntsman shareholders gets to walk away with an STD."

"If I were a betting man I'd say that this merger will be successfully scuttled by the White Tale Holdings crew. They have >15% of the outstanding shares of Clariant... Clariant needs 66% of all shares out to vote for the merger... the last shareholder meeting only 58% of all outstanding shares voted! They (White Tale) are highly motivated to stop this and the numbers are VERY challenging.So - looks like HUN will be getting a $60MM windfall in early 2018! For many other reasons, the failure of the merger is a good thing for everybody."

15 years ago Huntsman was at 23. 15 years later we are at 13.70. No spinoffs or splits. Great job Peter you are a great leader. Stop saying after each quarteryou care about shareholder value. The Board done a great job keeping you in.
Last few days sucked. Hoping we can get a nice 3-5% push
How can they go from Buy to a Neutral when there is no listing for them ever having HUN at a buy. I think that should say Initiated at a Neutral. I added some more to what I was holding.
The market is anticipating a bad report. I anticipate the same. The stock looks ready to take a big dive.

"Been in this stock, been out. Big fan of true entrepreneur JMH, RIP. The macro headwinds are overwhelming. The investor sentiment is negative. World growth is questionable if not declining.

You say I know nothing about the stock, and this may be true...looks like someone knows something we don't know? Can you elaborate? You mention ""the stock looks cheap?"" Why would it continue to drop day after day? Even when the DOW goes up 350 points, HUN can't hold a gain. We are now down 5%. I predict we close down 10%. This is again, one of those lessons the market teaches over and over again. Fall in love with a stock and get left standing at the altar. I should be ashamed of myself for holding this long, even when I had so called ""financial advisors"" say the stock looks healthy."

"Starboard CEO out yesterday talking about their recent moves. In regard to HUN he mentioned these highlights:1. Their assets are “irreplaceable” - he called them a moat2. They moved up the value chain away from some commodities and into higher margin products3. They should have much better EBITDA margins than they do - more like 18%4. He said their revenue growth could exceed 5%5. He called it a “compelling investment”He then went on to generally speak about CEOs (he is an activist investor after all) and how the good ones will push to better levels and improvements through Covid, while others might be satisfied with just holding their heads above water.He will be meeting with Huntsman management next week, but did not say if any specific management changes would be suggested."
I hope the futures keep pumping so I can dump a few duds tomorrow and load up on HUN.
"PAYO, PSFEMONEY right there guys"
Another support level....broken.
"It's worthwile to watch the video, where Roepers makes his case for HUN (speaking prior to Jim Chanos) ca 6/12 ago. Then, the stock was at ca 30, now it is at 20. Then, HUN's 50%-VNTR stake was worth 900 m, now it is worth 300 mill, ie 600 mill less.If you follow Roepers line of reasoning, one must adapt his assumptions as follows:THEN: He expected FCF generation over the next 2-3 y of ca 3b USD (including the sale/value of the VNTR stake, valued at 900m at that time). At that time the share was trading at ca 30 USD. With ca 240 mill shares outstanding, this translated to FC-generation of 12 USD/share. In other words, ca 40% of the share price (of 30 USD at that time) could be used for share buyback, acquisitions etc during the next 2-3y.NOW: If all other parameters of Ropers assumptions remain unchanged, the reduction in the VNTR value translates into FC-generation potential of 2.4B within the next 2-3 y (600 m less due to lower VNTR valuation). 2.4 B, ie 10 USD/Share (240 mill shares) as opposed to 12 USD/share at the time of Roepers presentation. With a current share price of 20USD this means that 50% the current share price can be expected to be generated as cash within the next 2-3 y. Theoretically they could buy back ""half"" of the company during the next 3 y's. Of course, these numbers can be revised downward, if you think that Roepers assumption of FC-generation were overly optimistic. But even then, the stock looks cheap.During last Q CC, The CEO Huntsman said 2 times that in this opinion there has never been such as disconnect between the SP and the intrinsic value of the company (the SP was around 23, now it is 20).FWIWDr John"

"HUN stock price trend matches other chemical companies like EMN. Nothing hidden in HUN, just getting sold along with the rest of the chemical sector. Question is: Why are chemical companies getting sold?"
The announcement says the combined company will assume Clariant's dividend policy. It's paying .45 chf (Swiss francs). The current exchange rate is $1 in Swiss francs equal $1.03 American. So it appears we can expect a sizable divvy jack.
Strong buy. Great cash flow!

Robert another point Huntsman is still holding 50 million shares of Venitormaterials. It’s now worth 70 million vs a couple of years ago at 1 billion dollars.Another great decision by Peter and company. Good chance they could go bankrupt and the investment is 0. Back 2017 this was design to pay down debt. Again thisBoard allows this guy to continue.
Surprised Huntsman has t been the subject of “being acquired” rumors. Few years backthat it seemed inevitable but now it seems toBe very quiet.
Wow!!!!

Happy to see the $2.1 billion sale. Will ensure a very healthy balance sheet going forward.

Upgrades continue this morning with new consensus target now at $40.38. Company will begin its huge buyback maybe up to $33 or so near term. I think we all need to relax. Great company!
"The question for investors is do you have any confidence in Peter Huntsman to deliver shareholder return. This stock has gone nowhere up in the past almost 15 years!!! They cleaned up the Balance sheet, increased dividend, have bought back stock, spun off their most cyclical division, and still NOTHING!!! Peter needs to either move out or sell HUN to another company that can deliver results!!!!"
They had some interesting insights about HUN on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
HUN stock price is absurdly cheap. The fundamentals look strong. The future looks solid. Management is effective. The balance sheet is strong. The stock price will be at least 50% higher next year.
HUN needs new senior management. Virtually no growth in 14 years. The family must put pressure on Peter to step down.
instinct went from buy to neutral on HUN this morning. probably because of the recent acquisition. I think it was a good move long term.
"Barclays underweight, price target $29"
This company produces EV battery material.
Sold off at end of day to zero out call options
Has anyone given the possibility that Peter knows what he is doing and that he has built a strong balance sheet company with moderate but sustained growth?? What if Hun is worth $40 easy?? I’m in!!
This is starting to look real good.
I expect a recovery after an early morning dip but what do I know?
Did we see the bottom this morning? I added more.
HUN is up 8.43% to 15.82
"Zachs Research reverses their rating on HUN from strong sell (sept 20, 2016) to Buy (sept 24) and price target at 20 by end of year. What a joke with this organization. Jefferies has Buy rating on HUN sept 24, with same price target year end $20. MY rating is Buy on HUN."
"Looks like HUN shareholders never wanted the merger to begin with and White Tail screwed Clariant investors.When this merger was announced, Clariant shares jumped and Huntsman shares dropped. Now that the merger is cancelled, Hunstman jumped big on huge volume and Clariant drops big. I for one called Investor Relations to tell HUN the terms of the merger were terrible, that HUN was worth more than a 20% premium and that Clariant was receiving the benefit of the Venator spin when it should have been HUN shareholders, ether in the form of shares or a huge dividend (preferrably sares). I told them HUN should have completed the spin off first before any merger or acquisition deals, and as the deal was structured HUN shareholder should have got a 40% premium rather 20%.Looks like I was right. The only thing Huntsman did wrong is they should have played chicken with Clariant to get the 60 million fee. The merger was never going to happen after White Tail corporate raiders killed it. No way Clariant had the votes.Given one of the main factors for the merger was to give Huntsman a better corporate tax rate, it looks like the new tax plans under Trump will give them the tax rate they would have got under the merger, so this is a win win for Huntsman shareholders."
Citi raised price target today to 43. Maintains buy rating.

In October, Smith accomplished something that even his more flamboyant, better-known activist peers can’t boast about: He took effective control of a Fortune 500 company—Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, which ranked No. 319, with some $8.5 billion in sales last year—while owning less than 10% of the company. Thanks to his success in running a highly contested proxy contest, Smith replaced the entire 12-member board of directors and assumed the role of chairman. Along with his handpicked board, he will soon choose a new CEO to run Darden. Welcome to the new world of corporate takeovers."
Current HUN eps are with about 20mil shares Less outstanding vs couple of years or so ago as result of buybacks!
"Citi lowers rating , cuts price target to $30 from $43!!!! No upside, only downside. Many better opportunities even in Chem space. Sell this misguided puppy!!!"
What is wrong with this company.....Most companies would die for a balance sheet like this one?
HUN is a very solid value stock in the material sector which is a sweet spot. Target price $34. A lot of room for the upside. Barron’s loves this stock. Buy while it’s still cheap.
But buy
"I completely give up on this stock. The trend is beyond down at this point. Lower lows, lower highs. I can only assume there is something with forward guidance we don't know about."
Company buying back stock !
HUN is up 5.06% to 33.23
Stocks don't drop 6% on no news. What gives here?
CFO leaves - some musings:1. Some fallout from a recent rift btw some within the Huntsman family and the Mormon church regarding giving and use of tithes?2. HUN’s future is really a sale and the CFO just securing his future?3. A personal move around age and/or stage in life?
Bottom should be in. Hun must deal with VNTR and worsening Credit worthiness issues before any sustainable move up is realized.
"Is the stock market revaluing with an expectation for a recession next year?HUN with a PE of about 7 looks like a steep discount, especially considering the earnings report today.HUN selloff since summer is not specific to HUN, rather HUN trended down along with the market and other chemical companies. Very interesting, very disturbing. Buying opportunity? I think Yes! Stock tend to do well in November, especially after a weak September-October."
Target price is $37. Is it time to buy?
HUN reached a new 52 Week Low at $20.90
"Last year Jon Huntsman Sr passed away. He was Executive Chairman of the board. Does anyone think it is remotely possible that he was the true leader of HUN and that when he passed, RIP, the company lost its rudder? I only knew Peter as a small child, but perhaps he is in over his head with nobody to have his back? Not trying to be mean, but Peter has a fiduciary responsibility that he is not measuring up to."
HUN is up 4.91% to 29.48
Coming in now
It’s time for an activist shareholder to initiate a coup. This company has so much potential but it’s stymied by cronyism. We need to demand new management or a sale of the company.
"DuPont (DD), Celanese (CE) and Huntsman (HUN) are among chemicals companies capable of ""significant"" Q3 earnings beats in an industry challenged by rising costs, KeyBanc said in a research note Monday.Those companies have greater exposure to the auto, electronics and construction markets, ""where a nascent demand rebound and healthy pricing power outweigh the risks of higher costs, KeyBanc analysts said.""However, for many other downstream/specialty companies, the moment when price catches up with costs is likely now further out into 2022, the firm said. ""Overall, we're dialing down risk a notch as the risks from the global energy crunch are far from apparent yet.""MTNewswires"
RBC maintains Outperform rating on HUN and raises price target from $36 to $37...
"Mgt. has an opportunity, after selling off a large portion of the business, to reshape the company. Hopefully Peter will have the correct vision and can adequately express to investor community. This will finally be “Peter’s” company!"
And no one thought the increase in home building wouldn’t help HUN?Nice to see...
Down $40% from $33.00. All with virtually no news. Pretty lame situation.
Huntsman is down 10.07% to 16.07
"If you have a 2 to 4 year time frame, now may be the time to start looking at this company. They still have a ton of money to repurchase shares, and compared to other chems, this stock is looking cheap."
the company loves buying back their stock under 30
"Has received very positive treatment on Seeking Alpha (Prati). He expects strong coming performance from HUN, TSE, DOW."
"check that tighenting equalibrium! I believe this bottom is most likely in, a bounce to at least $32 in the next few days is likely. and if we can break resistance start looking to $35"
