Anthem reached an all time high at 435.29
"Market drop today is more correlated to Sanders win in Nevada than the corona virus, just look at the SHCOMP. This is what the democrats will do to your investments. And whatever is left, they'll transfer that to those who won't work or pay their bills."
"That was fun, made bank on the calls stock. Why did this go down to $363 and change today?"
"12:05 PM EST, 01/30/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Anthem's (ANTM) average rating among analysts is a buy, with an average price target of $333."
Anthem reached an all time high at 429.76
"This stock is like a yoyo, up and down up and down. Time to sell now and buy again at $370?"
Is there a leak for earnings or a misprint? Up 13 points in AH.
"Looks like it will be a sluggish day, but to anyone whose here, $CVS is still - down 5.92% YTD ($CI up 13.95% YTD, $UNH up 36.57% YTD, $HUM up $34.22% YTD, $ANTM up 15.24% YTD)- CVS has the lowest PE ratio of all healthcare stocks of 10x to 12x- Coming off consecutive great quarters and going to finish with a great year- new CEO - heavily involved in Vaccine administrationPrice should be ($5.45 EPS ex $2 Div times 18 to 20 times) = $100For those that believe in $CVS, please hold your position and let's make today a good day.Honestly everything else ... energy stock weed stock tech stocks are already overpriced... investors need to recognize the value here and keep $CVS going up today."
Today and for the next 2 weeks when all the weak hands sold this stock will recover back to $310. Strong beat and guidance . Forget Bernie he’s delusional and Medicare for all will never work or ever be close to entertain
"Given that I have to pay $3,000.00 a month to this company for a family of 3 for health insurance, it's no wonder this stock is up."

Blow out YES
Down over $5 in pre market after this report raising guidance to the top end? This makes no sense to me.
$423 is time to sell. Can't believe peeps are not taking profits at this level.

"After this report, I do not understand why ANTM is trading down over $9 in pre market. Bernie Sanders is not going to win the Democratic nomination. ANTM beats and raises every quarter I've been following them. They pay a great dividend which they just increased, and it's a great company to own in your portfolio. Yet you have companies out there like TSLA that have been parabolic for months, and are grossly overvalued. There are many more. I'm not selling here, I'm adding."
Zacks put out a negative spin on the earnings stating that they missed their expectations. Geeeeez
"Anthem Q4 earnings up 120%; non-GAAP EPS up 59%GREAT Q4 RESULTS, GREAT GUIDANCE, REVENUE TOPPED EXPECTATIONS"
"Any body who did not own this stock yet, better do it before this coming Wednesday. it is undervalue and discount stock at this moment. Why? Normally, ANTM and UNH has a price gap around 30 dollars. ANTM has a lot stronger balance sheet. Debt is lower, growth rate both earnings and revenue is higher than UNH. The upgrade from Wall St. comes at the right time. The investors move money from risk security to risk off, it is just so perfect that is why UNH moves up more than 20 points in just a few days. The remaining question will be how high ANTM will go. I guess ANTM should be around 270 with in a month. I recommend CI will go from 166 to 180 by Nov 1st."
still very under-valued stock...
"gives it a few days. solid earnings but no movements means manipulation, if you give in you lose. they are trying to test your patience. I am long so I dont really care for short term movement. it will be back to 300 as soon as hedges flood back in"
Been holding for 3 years and I can’t remember a day like this. Good luck all

Looks like the sellers are in control. It will go back up as soon as they are done. Time to start a small position and lag in over time. Price is $364 and change.
Bought stock and calls. This will be back above $370-$380 range soon. Way too cheap here.
Healthcare plan sector is being affected by CI quarterly earnings today.
"ANTM's PE this year will be around 13.7 and drop down under 10 next year. Next year all the health care will get a big break from the all big drug companies because of the pressure from the Dem. and GOP on the election year. The investors will relocate their assets to the risk off stocks, with dividends and moderate growth. All health care providers will get the wind fall profit from the election year."
"lol, too funny. Here we go again, they will hold it down for a few weeks at most. Bought stock. See you back above $400 soon."
Why the big drop?
Also raising the dividend is reflecting of the company’s confidence. I don’t get it. A small bump in expenses hardly justifies a $10 drop in the stock price. I will never understand Wall Street antics.
"This company continues to beat estimates, and then raise their earnings with strong guidance. If this doesn't trade over $270 today I'd be very surprised, regardless of what you see in pre market."
Oh well the $5 billion buy back is very positive indeed .
Anthem is up 5.14% to 413.97
Should I buy or not ??
15x the 2020 projected EPS of 22 should make a price target of 330.
Thank you Bernie!!
Beat and raised guidance so the stock could drop. Figures...
Why is there no news on all this?
"I am not a socialist, but Anthem is the poster child for why for profit medical management should not be allowed. How many people could be treated, and how much money given for research with Anthem's profits? Congress, on both sides of the aisles is to deep in their pockets."
