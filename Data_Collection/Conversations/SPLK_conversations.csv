Institutional traders are trying to push this stock down to get cheap shares. They all know SPLK's potential in the future. Don't sell yours shares too cheap. This company has domination in the cloud business.
"Next catalyst will be earnings. It should be when they show positive operating cash flow - that is the signal to take-off as it means that operation expansion going forward will be profitable and cash generating after investment is complete. Last earnings call showed negative OCF, but the CFO said this should turn positive and stay there going forward."
Beautiful
"I'm getting more bullish on this. Future quarters are going to start generating nice returns. Cash from operations will turn positive and stay that way into the future. As on-prem business growth plateaus or slows down, overall revenue growth rate will start to accelerate due to impact of cloud ARR growth. Lots to like here. Holding my position for next several years at least, and I think long-term shareholders will be rewarded nicely from here."
"This is on the way up. CFO clearly said that operating cash turns positive next quarter and for the subsequent 4 quarters after that. This will position them to be a FCF machine once their growth slows down (which should hopefully not be very soon). Given the growth rates, solid profitability and the transition to cloud largely done - I'd say this is ready to go up over the next years. Recent price target raises to >$200 could prove too pessimistic."
Theres a gap that might get filled 185 real quick lets go
"Finally this thing comes back, I've been down a long time on it. Hopefully it can keep going."
"Down almost 5% today. No news. Such is the market. Just wait until they start reporting positive operating cash flow. When everyone realizes that SPLK has the potential to be a FCF machine at the end of their growth phase (which is many years away thank goodness), this thing is going to soar. This company is not a ""profitless prosperity"" story. Starting next quarter, look for positive operating cash flows !!"
This company has all the hallmarks of a great value investment. Happily building my position month by month. Will be a very long term hold - there is a lot of growth ahead for this company.

"Incredibly, DDOG and SPLK are almost on par with each other. DDOG 2021 Revenues = $801MM. SPLK = $2.4B. Either one is drastically over value or one is drastically under value."
"Splunk price target raised to $210 from $200 at RBC CapitalSplunk price target raised to $203 from $198 at NeedhamSplunk price target raised to $200 from $160 at Summit InsightsRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised the firm's price target on Splunk to $210 from $200 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst cites the company's ""strong"" Q2 cloud annual recurring revenue growth of 72% as it showed no deceleration from Q1. Hedberg adds that Splunk experienced success across all geographies while its management noted a ""strong"" pipeline and a positive spending environment continuing into Q3."
Been in a small stake since the 113 range. Big fan of companies switching to sub model. Similar to when Peter Lynch bought Mutual banks switching to public on undervaluation in the 80's like to buy companies switching to subscription model on drop based on initial hit to the top line.
200 by dec
$SPLK heading back up even in this crazy #$%$ market. In for $5000 and will hold until they're back to $200. GLTA longs!!!
"I was planning to take my profits at athâ€™s im changing my mind , im holding this as a long term investment, no reason to not go above 300 next year"
I love how SPLK is down on bond yield rises even tho they just closed a $1B debt agreement with Silver Lake. Splunk is doing just fine. SPLK is WAY oversold.
$SPLK should be heading to $185 soon and then to $200 by earnings unless the broader market sells off. They've done everything right with their transition. Hopefully everyone bought when it dipped down to $112 like I did!!! GLTA longs!!!
170 resistance stronger than my whole life :)
Still a growth company. Rev numbers will start to look better this coming quarter more cloud rev comes in.
