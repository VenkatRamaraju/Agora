"Feels like expectations are building in advance of earnings. Some are expecting to see first signs of ""an end"" to the cloud transition. I'm optimistic. Even if not this quarter, then for sure this will come in the next 6 months. Will wait until after earnings to decide whether to build this position further."
"As everyone know, this discounted price is due to negative fluctuation of revenue in last quarters. However, it is just a transition period. When its trend become positive again, this stock will exceed 300$ in a few months."
Splunk will likely be profitable next year. The losses mean NOTHING!
Looks like profit taking after big gains. Should good back up over the next few months if market does not crash. In at $159 after cost avging. Will hold until back in the 170s.
Toxic selling is over and price ready to pop big!https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5630521-microsoft-investment-in-4b-rubrik-cybersecurity-highlights-undiscovered-4m-data443-extremely
Head and shoulders bottom completed and retest of breakout done. Higher prices on the way.
I think we break this 6 month consolidation and head north barring any Fed induced macro mayhem

Pretty sharp move by J Childs to buyback 1.65M shares of SPLK @ Avg price of $139. Good opening move with the Silver Lake $:https://www.thetechnologyletter.com/the-posts/splunk-has-been-a-hot-mess-but-thats-changing-says-cfo-jason-child
UBS lifted the price target for Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) from $137 to $175. Splunk shares rose 1.9% to $144.05 in pre-market trading.
Will close unchanged at market close today
Won't be with you 25th leaving 24th return 27thNot selling before earnings. GLL
"This 15 point gain in 5 days is a gift, but it has me nervous about tomorrow. I pray earnings are just more than expected, and guidance is spectacular."
Yeah market is getting boring how about we make some upgrades:))
Wood bought another 116K shares yesterday within ARKW :)
all cyber stocks have been going off the past year. Splunk will have its moment!
Teeeviiiiiin where are you!!!! those double digits you talking about is finally arrived bro ^_^
Looks like a lot of profit taking going on. Looking forward to the post-consolidation move.
The one thing that bugs me is how quick to sell insiders have been and the minority holdings they have
Within days of NASDAQ listing and $10 million cash from MAXIM. Price ready to pop really big! Comps suggest $4.00 to $50. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5630521-microsoft-investment-in-4b-rubrik-cybersecurity-highlights-undiscovered-4m-data443-extremely
"As of COB Friday (8/28/21) Cathie Wood's Next Generation Internet (ARKW) fund owns 518K shares of SPLK worth $79M. This amount represents 1.38% of the ETF's holdings. I have to admit I cringed when ARK dumped the stock in the $200s when the outlook narrative got muddled. It's favorable to see them back-in and accumulating shares now that clarity is being restored. The institutional ownership list of SPLK is a veritable ""who's-who"" of Smart Money. Adding Ken Hoa to the Board is a brilliant move. The new administrative/executive hires combined with the engineering team that Tully put together before departing is formidable. This is becoming an impressive setup for both the short and long term."
Huge beat! SPLK is back baby! Hopefully NTNX will be similar next week.
Retest of the breakout today. I look for higher prices
"Splunk price target raised to $210 from $200 at RBC CapitalSplunk price target raised to $203 from $198 at NeedhamSplunk price target raised to $200 from $160 at Summit InsightsRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised the firm's price target on Splunk to $210 from $200 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst cites the company's ""strong"" Q2 cloud annual recurring revenue growth of 72% as it showed no deceleration from Q1. Hedberg adds that Splunk experienced success across all geographies while its management noted a ""strong"" pipeline and a positive spending environment continuing into Q3."
"Where is gary lol. I see splunk hitting either 170 or 180 in a month or so. Cathy is also back. Good signs for us,"
"Just waiting for the shift in revenue recognition (from shift to cloud subscriptions) to get done. Then we can see higher growth again, and mgmt. can also start talking of positive operating cash flows."
Picked up some 140S 8-25 Coming.
"This is on the way up. CFO clearly said that operating cash turns positive next quarter and for the subsequent 4 quarters after that. This will position them to be a FCF machine once their growth slows down (which should hopefully not be very soon). Given the growth rates, solid profitability and the transition to cloud largely done - I'd say this is ready to go up over the next years. Recent price target raises to >$200 could prove too pessimistic."
Google and Microsoft plan to spend billions on cyber security. I think Google might as well buy SPLK to complement their cyber security plan
Don’t think these new hires would have happened unless they got some positive indication of recovery....
Christmas is cool but have you ever waited months for a good earnings market seems to be pricing in some good whether or not its true. Almost got margin called to hold my options
"I was holding Splunk for more than a year and wrote many comments on this board.At that time the Nasdaq was up 50%, competitors like Datagdog doubled and SPLK barely moved.Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a great company.But I am not sure it is a good pick right now when the market is that high.In the last quarter after they lost 471 millions, I decided that if they lose more than 200 millions in the next quarter I am out. It's true there were companies in the past losing money and turning to be profitable.But not all companies and even Salesforce which is a huge company never lost that much money in one quarter. Look what happened with WIX. They beat earnings every quarter but because of their losses, the stock is now around 200$ after it was trading at 360$ a few months ago. Good luck longs."
up $6 AH. looks like a narrowed loss. haven't seen revenues yet
Cash left is $100 mil?? So we should expect offering very soon?
"Just waiting to hear what they say at earnings and how much longer the transition to cloud will be. Once it becomes clear that SPLK is ""returning"" to high growth mode based on cloud offerings, this will take off."
"Sold. Last quarter they lost 471 millions, now 384 millions. I don't care if they beat on revenue, this company is losing too much money.Good luck."
"I dont mind it to drop back to low 100’s after earnings , id love to miss all the buying opportunities before hitting profitability"
Palo Alto networks. Great beat. And announced a major repurchase share buyback. Go splunk
