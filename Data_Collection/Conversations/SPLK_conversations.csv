Be ready for dilution
Analysts upgrades will move this stock tomorrow... Just like they did after last ER.
"All the reasons why Splunk is about to fly:1. Splunk reached unreasonably low prices.In 2014 the stock reached 95$ which is only 15% down from the current level. Back in 2014, the annual revenue was 300 million while in 2020 annual revenue was 2.359 billion so basically, revenue doubled 8 times while stock barely moved. In 2018 the stock was trading at 130$ and from that time annual revenue doubled but the stock dropped. Before Covid, the stock was trading at 175$, and even on March 17 when the stock market had the biggest crash, Splunk didn't reach the current level. From June 2020 till November 2020 (6 months) the stock was trading around 200$ so unlike other growth stocks, Splunk's 52-wk high was justified and held for a while. So we can all agree it is very low and you have to ask yourself what happened. 2. On April 14 the stock was trading at 150$ and dropped after CTO resigned and Splunk stock got downgraded by Morgan Stanley to 180$. From that day the stock dropped 25% while Nasdaq down only 3%. Oversold - Oversold - Oversold 3. All growth stocks got a big hit lately but you can't compare them to Splunk.Splunk is a company founded in 2003 and year after year the company kept growing and become the leading of Big Data. If Splunk had an IPO today it was probably getting a market cap of 50 billion like Palantir. Even if Splunk was not a growth stock anymore (and it is), still it is way undervalued. Fsly dropped more than 60% from its 52-wk high but still has a 5 billion market cap with only 200 million revenue, if you compare it to Splunk you have to agree it is still expensive. Splunk also has a 1.77 billion cash flow, unlike other growth stocks that can run out of money in the near future. 4. Splunk has an ongoing growth opportunity.Splunk operates in the Big Data industry, a market on track to grow from $41.3 billion in 2019 to $116.1 billion by 2027.Splunk now has more than 500 large, enterprise-level clients in FY2021, up from 355 in the prior year, illustrating the company's success at attracting deep-pocketed customers. These clients each generate total annual recurring revenue (ARR) of over $1 million.5. Acquisition. At that level Splunk is an acquisition target. Period. 6. Splunk’s Transition Phase Is Almost OverMany bears or skeptics pointed out that Splunk’s transition into a SaaS company is causing the company's growth and current revenue to decline. If one is looking at the company from a short-term perspective, this might be bad news. However, for investors who are seeking long-term opportunities, the recent decline in share prices is only creating more opportunities because switching to a SaaS business model is clearly not a bad decision. Splunk may seem like they are struggling because they are not receiving a one-time big payment from their customers. However, the company is being paid regularly allowing Splunk to easily increase the duration of the contracts, increase the subscription fee, and sell more services. Thus, a short-term decline in revenue is actually a great thing for the company. Once, the transition is complete, investors will start seeing annual revenues grow again, and the stock, most likely, will rebound (SaaS companies are valued higher than other companies as well).Who else says you better buy SPLK ?

Cash left is $100 mil?? So we should expect offering very soon?
"Starting to see lots more advertisements for SPLK, so I’m thinking conversion is almost done. We’ll have to see on next earnings. Just nice to see them getting their name out instead of being a hidden gem."
Splk will be a 300+ stock in 12-18 months.. seems like the transition to subscription is almost over.. Also Cathie is now making a re entry with 183k stocks - that reconfirms my understanfing of why she got rid of splk on its way down..
Earning call was very positive.70% margin in 1 yrRetention rate of close to 100%Most customers moving from on premise to cloud version...This is Google 3.0.
This is a $500-$600 stock in the next few years. Their customer acquisition is amazing!
The one thing that bugs me is how quick to sell insiders have been and the minority holdings they have
Will end green today!
Either retraces to 129 and next leg up would be 165-170 or it would just start the leg up from here ( 132-133 )
Splunk beat estimates... GG longs
"In the Pure Earnings Short Sell game, you are only as good as your next trade. And so each and every day I set out on an epic hunt to identify the singular best stock to sell short ahead of earnings release and hold through the actual release. Right now I am Short DCI and feeling very good about the likelihood this will sell off today, but what is next on the horizon, for the Wednesday AH/Thursday PM reporting period?? Well, this is not an easy pick for me, because I have identified six different stock plays that look really good for this time, but none stand out strongly above the others, and each has at least one negative point that causes me to hesitate in choosing it. My 6 chosen possibilities are:DSGXGWRENTAPSPLKCIENSJMI think there is a 75-80% chance that EACH one of these will go down in response to her pending earnings release. But which one is MOST likely to go down the MOST, with less likelihood to spike up strongly if they deliver a very positive ER??? Well, I am only going to play ONE of the six, and right now, assuming the stock does not collapse early in the day before I can get in, my choice is going to be...SPLK. The SAFEST play in the bunch is SJM, by far. This stock is way overvalued and VERY likely to go down. It has little upside potential even if it delivers a strong earnings beat and positive Guidance. But...I see the downside potential as being limited to 3-6%. On the other hand, SPLK is riskier in terms of upside danger if they deliver an excellent earnings report, but has a lot better odds of collapsing 6-15% if they miss on EPS or Revenue consensus estimates, which I think is quite likely to occur. The one gaping negative I find in SPLK as a Pure Earnings Short Sell is that the stock is nowhere near her 52 week high. In fact she is closer to her 52 week low. But...I think SPLK may be a failed company. And today's upcoming ER may be the ""proof"" the overall market needs to really take her down in terms of stock price. That is my bet on this play, and here are a few reasons SPLK should collapse even further than she already has, in direct response to today's ER:1: Company is hugely over-valued despite collapsing in stock price over the past 12 months.2: Company is not profitable and has no clear or near-term path to profitability. 3: Company is in a sector full of progressive and stand-out companies and is simply being outclassed.4: EPS has gotten worse and worse every year since 2018. 5: Analysts are quite bullish on SPLK, which I think has helped keep the stock price ""up"". Today's ER should be a slap in the face waking everyone up to the very real risk that this company will FAIL. 6: I see very good odds that SPLK will miss consensus on either EPS or Revenue, or both. If this happens, a 6%-15% sell-off from the $120 level, is likely to occur. 7: Overall financials via a comprehensive analysis, are bad. They do not support the stock price, not even at the $120 level. 8: Insiders have been dumping their shares in recent months, including the CEO and the CFO! 9: SPLK has Guided Down FIVE consecutive times, between March of 2020 and March of 2021.10: SPLK has failed to meet consensus estimates on EPS or Revenue, three out of their last four earnings releases. For all these reasons and more, I will likely choose SPLK as my Pure Earnings Short Sell Play of the Day, and go Short with a lot of shares, at some point this afternoon. Good Luck Folks!"
Don’t think these new hires would have happened unless they got some positive indication of recovery....
"I don't know about the rest of you, but SPLK being up big after earnings made me a bit uncomfortable.........:)"
Picked up some 140S 8-25 Coming.
Not even sure why the shares price is dipping…
all cyber stocks have been going off the past year. Splunk will have its moment!
Citi analyst Tyler Radke lift Splunk's target price to 145$ from 125$https://www.barrons.com/articles/three-stock-picks-to-play-observability-software-51625761085So the worst analysis for Splunk now is 145$ with a high forecast of 265$.Current Enterprise Value/Revenue is only 9. This is ridiculous!!! Enterprise Value/Revenue of 14 (which is also very moderate) sets the stock price at 210$ . Datadog's Enterprise Value/Revenue is 48 !
Haven't sold 1 share through the whole decline. Fully confident the market will reward SPLK longs again. I expect SPLK to eventually take out the old highs again. Anyone who says the current price makes sense is clueless.
"breaking: Splunk price target raised to $250 from $200 at RosenblattRosenblatt analyst Yun Kim raised the firm's price target on Splunk to $250 from $200 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Following recent industry checks, the analyst believes the disparity between high spending priority software initiatives and lower priority ones is likely to become larger in the second half of the year and well into next year. Kim continues to pick up signs that large-scale business application deployments remain a lower spending priority and smaller-sized deals with existing customers remaining the norm. The pace of initiatives related to the migration of workloads to the cloud is accelerating and the scope is getting larger, Kim tells investors in a research note."
Bought 145.40
.50c up after beating revenue. Seriously 
"splunk is establishing 145 a share as a base, the work is on to bring in more revenue. I can smell it."
SPLK IS MIA TODAY
This stock is so undervalued at such a low price due to the general sell off in the market. Earnings are amazing and tech will recover soon.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buy-the-dip-with-apple-microsoft-and-these-other-tech-stocks-before-they-fly-way-higher-says-analyst-11614860585

Where are the shorts? Can’t see them posts anymore
Just treading water. 25th will tell the story.

Splunk Ranks First in Both IT and Security Market Share Reports by Gartner....NO Surprise there!
Cloud ARR was up 83% Y/Y and total ARR grew 41% to $2.36B.Customers with ARR greater than $1M increased 44% to 510.
This is a sad stock
"Just waiting to hear what they say at earnings and how much longer the transition to cloud will be. Once it becomes clear that SPLK is ""returning"" to high growth mode based on cloud offerings, this will take off."
Splunk is up 4.98% to 152.31
The stock jumps in a crazy way after market then goes back to normal with the normal sessions its been hapening for the last 2 weeks and i don’t understand it ? Would anyone explain
"breaking: Wells Fargo raises Splunk price target to $250 (from $205)The firm writes that Wall Street ""underappreciates how Splunk is opening up its aperture so that Splunk can be used in more places,"" including ""data in motion, data from any source, and machine learning anywhere.""

Stock will probably head to $160s before earnings later this month unless we see the overall sector dip. Still see $SPLK heading to $200 after earnings as they are DUE! GLTA!
I know some people sold this after ER around 110-112 range. Now its up and trend seems to be bullish. That's why you should not try to time the market. Its not pragmatic decision.
"Splunk price target raised to $210 from $200 at RBC CapitalSplunk price target raised to $203 from $198 at NeedhamSplunk price target raised to $200 from $160 at Summit InsightsRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised the firm's price target on Splunk to $210 from $200 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst cites the company's ""strong"" Q2 cloud annual recurring revenue growth of 72% as it showed no deceleration from Q1. Hedberg adds that Splunk experienced success across all geographies while its management noted a ""strong"" pipeline and a positive spending environment continuing into Q3."
"IMHO if u cannot sustain volatility, SPLUNK is not for you ... it may go UP another $ 20 and it could also drop $ 50 quickly -- sometimes it make sense to take a gain while it is possible -- the rubber band is stretch to the maximum with all the indices at all-time high, I think this is a risky game !"
Discount
This is a 150$ stock
$145 by end of day?
Two words. The market wants to hear. It’s BUY BACK.

+8% pre market any news? Im happy both ways 131 broke like its nothing
"Feels like expectations are building in advance of earnings. Some are expecting to see first signs of ""an end"" to the cloud transition. I'm optimistic. Even if not this quarter, then for sure this will come in the next 6 months. Will wait until after earnings to decide whether to build this position further."
I think we break this 6 month consolidation and head north barring any Fed induced macro mayhem
Were is that ‘ you gotta be drunk to own splunk ‘ guy ? .. guess hes on a hang over 
Increased my position.. bought it at $155 $158 $162 and today at $167.... win win win and expect more returns
Christmas is cool but have you ever waited months for a good earnings market seems to be pricing in some good whether or not its true. Almost got margin called to hold my options

R.I.P shorts!!!!!!
Longs will be rewarded after the company transitions to annual invoicing which will generate strong cash flow going forward.. Do your research and buy this dip while it lasts.
"As of COB Friday (8/28/21) Cathie Wood's Next Generation Internet (ARKW) fund owns 518K shares of SPLK worth $79M. This amount represents 1.38% of the ETF's holdings. I have to admit I cringed when ARK dumped the stock in the $200s when the outlook narrative got muddled. It's favorable to see them back-in and accumulating shares now that clarity is being restored. The institutional ownership list of SPLK is a veritable ""who's-who"" of Smart Money. Adding Ken Hoa to the Board is a brilliant move. The new administrative/executive hires combined with the engineering team that Tully put together before departing is formidable. This is becoming an impressive setup for both the short and long term."
This stock should be your hedge against a market crash :))
"Analyst Actions: Rosenblatt Securities Initiates Coverage on Splunk With Buy Rating, $150 Price TargetBY MT Newswires— 9:47 AM ET 09/10/2019"
Good luck longs. I sold. I might buy back after earnings.
"Added shares. I am hopeful that this earnings report will change the narrative. If Management can get their act together, this stock could fly."
Not much movement
Any reason for this to be steadily going higher even if there is weakness in market?
"Good quarter. Added some big-time clients in Nvidia, Shopify, Okta, Tide, and the US Census Bureau. Management is finally pulling it together."
$200 target by year end. Every analyst recommending it. No competition of Splunk in this space and recommended by 92 of Fortune 100 companies. Most safe bet in IT big caps as it’s 25% below it’s highs.
"Splunk stock gains on Summit upgrade after post-earnings pullbackhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3703729-splunk-stock-gains-on-summit-upgrade-after-post-earnings-pullbackCalling a bottom for shares following last week's post-earnings pullback, Summit Insights upgrades Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) from Hold to Buy with a $160 price target, implying a more than 40% upside to Friday's close.Analyst Srini Nandury says the risks are ""favorable at the current levels"" and the firm believes ""patient investors will benefit from buying the stock."""
Google and Microsoft plan to spend billions on cyber security. I think Google might as well buy SPLK to complement their cyber security plan
Looks like a lot of profit taking going on. Looking forward to the post-consolidation move.
"I Will try to give an objective opinion here - shorts, you win...for now. Looked at the transcript - will probably be more pain in the short/medium term. However, this could be a terrific rebound play early to mid next year. Doug mentioned that they have plenty of big deals in late-stage talks, but customers were nervous about the economic outlook. Unless he is full of it(which is possible) next year could be a big year for Splunk. This is still an industry leader and they are breaking into other markets with their acquisitions. I will stay long, but do not expect any positive price action for at least a few months. As an analyst noted this morning, Splunk will need to earn back investor confidence."
"Red again, let’s get to $150 soon…"
"This is lagging prior to datadog , 200 is still an undervalue for it"
Institutional traders are trying to push this stock down to get cheap shares. They all know SPLK's potential in the future. Don't sell yours shares too cheap. This company has domination in the cloud business.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Multistockalerts.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"Need a rebound over $150, let’s go!"
141.25 was a major resistance level if we close above it its will act as a support going forword and the new bottom
"Not sure what to make of this one. Long-term, should have a good growth runway. Short term could be quite bumpy, and might get a better entry point. Good to build up a position slowly I think."
Up 5% after hours. Someone is buying.
Take a break and deep breath’s for the next leg up *deep breath*
Palo Alto networks. Great beat. And announced a major repurchase share buyback. Go splunk
"Splunk pmaintained BUY and $260 price target at ARGUSSplunk pmaintained BUY and $260 price target at ARGUSArgus analyst Joseph #$%$ keeps his Buy rating and $260 price target on Splunk (SPLK), noting that while the company's Q3 results were ""disappointing"" as some of the quarter's deals slipped into Q4, he remains positive on its presence in a fast-growing market. The analyst has seen Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) move through the same transition from perpetual licensing to ratable licenses and come out as stronger and higher-margin companies. #$%$ further contends that Splunk could become an acquisition target for a larger enterprise software firm."

Wow 1 billion investment and 10% sp increase !
Bail before market close. It’s too late after that
This stock is a keeper. Only good things coming for this company.
won't go over $140 again for at least another 6 mos.
"We could see a fast rally to 165-170$ , volume is decreasing alot"
Is today ‘sell all cloud stocks’ day?
Splunk is up 5.31% to 148.82
"From the IPO until today, SPLK has compounded at ~15-16%. Not bad. Plus, growth should potentially accelerate as we get into next year and the transition to cloud is completed. Just food for thought."
"Road back to 200. I have been saying this was undervalued. Activists could not resist the opportunity here. Great product with lots of potential, but a need for changes in strategy."
"A break of the 151 level is crucial , lets wait and see"
Nice break of the moving average with a beautiful green fat candle to close the week
up $6 AH. looks like a narrowed loss. haven't seen revenues yet
How did splunk manage to stay in red when it’s competitors and broader market is in green
$SPLK > $DDOG
What happened today with every stock I bought?Shhh..
"This is on the way up. CFO clearly said that operating cash turns positive next quarter and for the subsequent 4 quarters after that. This will position them to be a FCF machine once their growth slows down (which should hopefully not be very soon). Given the growth rates, solid profitability and the transition to cloud largely done - I'd say this is ready to go up over the next years. Recent price target raises to >$200 could prove too pessimistic."
Nice start.
Just a few days left to sell at a premium and buy back later at a significant discount
revenue expected to go up 17% (basically back up to FYE2020 levels) and its trading at 50x revenue? I'll pass.
"Don't sell Splunk, you will regret it! I also had WIX on my portfolio and the stock was down already 40% after earnings for the same reason and it recovered much faster than I thougth (30% in the last two weeks). Good luck longs."

Baby is ready for take off
"Today it is a good oportunity to add shares.Not sure there would be many more. The stock is undervalued compared to all other big data software companies (Datadog, Palantir, Elastic) and trading only at 9X times earnings."

"Again all similar stocks are in green, junkie splunkie in red"

Shirts are getting roasted
Buy all you can at these levels. These oversold conditions won’t last. Market should rally fiercely in the next 2 weeks. Shorts will be squeezed like lemons. This is going back over 200.
Huge beat! SPLK is back baby! Hopefully NTNX will be similar next week.
I use Splunk for work on a daily basis (cybersecurity in a major bank).Every month we’re adding dozens of users (i.e. Splunk $$$ licenses).This is going on across all banks and FIs in North America.The cloud adoption is HUGE and the new ML Splunk library is getting more and more popular.My target price is $250+ in a year.It will be even more if cyber tensions with Russia will escalate.A CEO/CTO that doesn’t spend enough on cyber defence will be fired.
"Splunk is moving higher. If you had the chance to buy it at 120$, you are lucky.But now with Silver Lake it's even a better entry point, with much less risk. Looking good, let's see if it can close above 140$ ."
Rip bears 
everyone is happy now that its above the 120 mark...
SPLK had ABC pullback to the Breakout level 142 - right at the 20 sma. Added back Jan Calls. If it continues the pattern from here - looking for move up to UBB approx 159 now -- at least allows retest of the Earnings rally high of 152.88. The base height over last 6 months projects to 170 + by Feb. Fun with charts :)Nice to have a superstar stock to work into year end - into Jan. Go Big Data :)
"Splunk maintained BUY and $235 price target ahead of earnings report at RBC CapitalRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg keeps his Outperform rating and $235 price target on Splunk ahead of its Q4 earnings. The analyst notes that enterprise spending trends have been solid, and he is positive on the risk-reward for the stock given the conservative guidance and the negative investor sentiment. Hedberg adds that he is confident in Splunk's ability to grow and take share in a market called operational intelligence."
Silver lake has performed their due diligence. They know the true value
"Splunk initiated with Buy, $196 price target at RosenblattRosenblatt analyst Blair Abernethy initiated coverage of Splunk with a Buy rating and $196 price target. The company is ""very well positioned"" to maintain and grow its leadership position within enterprise IT, Security and DevOps teams, Abernethy tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes Splunk is widely recognized as a product leader in several ""key, rapidly growing"" IT operations software market segments."
Datadog climbs 8% after topping Q1 estimates and providing a full-year outlook of 880 million (1/3 compared to Splunk revenues). The current market cap is 24 billion so just imagine where Splunk can reach after completing the transition and showing growth.
SPLK up on Q2 earnings DDOG. Make sure to dump SPLK before Q2 earnings call.
Will close unchanged at market close today
Won't be with you 25th leaving 24th return 27thNot selling before earnings. GLL
so somebody takes a 5% position in the company and the stock goes up 11%....hows does that work
"Splunk dropped 50% because investors concerns it is not growing too fast. Well, it is. Datadog was up 8% after release its earnings with Strong growth of larger customers, with 100k+.For Splunk large customers are with over 1 million! Datadog market cap: 29 billionRevenue: 800 millionSplunk market cap: 20 billionRevenue: 2.5 billion"
"Splunk's daily chart looks better than it was a few weeks ago.I won't be surprised if it turns green.There is still a huge upside with Splunk, be patient."
"Ok, so we don't have a price target with 60% upside from Morgan Stanley (the last price target was 210$).But this is such an overreaction...Fair value is 160$ + which is the lowest price target by more than 20 analysts covering the stock. With good earnings, it should get back to 200$ quickly."
Stock is way too volatile. Plummets for months and then skyrockets just because some other company holds a msall stake now?

Nice AM-SPLK was a former leader. Lets look for good news on the 25th.
Watch 143 levels if it breaks this will fly to 150 very quick
Looks like they beat big time all around and projections are being increased - no idea why it’s down after market but I’m buying big time at these prices and again tomorrow
What happened ?
Dropped more than broader market and similar stocks. Not good

Shorts caught in deeply undervalued company. Transition far enough along to see steady uptrend to fair value closer to $300.
"My number one pick the last 4 years, they offered strong guidance for the rest of the year and they are truly best of breed in machine data analysis with 38% year over year growth rate. It's rare when you can find a company whose stock is both growth and value. Should return to 140 by EOY"
"I see SPLK hitting $180 by the year end. I would however, start taking profit from $160 level. It's the most significantly undervalued stock in this segment."
Rami why did you sell?
Back to the $132-$133. I will add some there.

"I view stocks in a very simple manner. You do your research. And, then, you just have to make more than you lose. You are going to make some bad choices and then you are going to make some great choices. Your great choices just need to outweigh your bad ones. Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson didn't always hit a home run when they stepped up to the plate. But, everybody remembers their home runs instead of their strikeouts. It is that simple.I messed up with SPLK. I tried to trade it...but, then I just got stuck with a long position at a loss. It was not one of my home runs and my batting average is pretty good. I don't know what to do with it to be honest. I am hoping that it will turn around, but I am losing faith. It may just end up being a tax right off by the end of the year. I don't know. I wish that I could tell you to jump on board and make money off of this stock, but I can't. I have been sitting on dead money for a while now. SPLK has not been a good stock to own."
"Think about those who bought Splunk at the lowest level, around 115$.If you entered that low, after the stock dropped 50%, you will expect a profit of at least 30%. Don't even consider selling before 150$ and it can get there much faster than you think. I truly believe Splunk will double by the end of the year."

"If you don’t understand technically how well Splunk is positioned to gain with its solution portfolio, that’s fine, but investors, this is an extremely undervalued opportunity given the industry trends in data, saas, and their security solutions. Looking forward to watching them grow."
Bail before earnings? Bad news ahead IMO
It's about to fly
"While post of it's peers are sitting at Price/Sales ratio of over 30, this is sitting below 9. Investors are going to realise soon and push this past 200 again."

"For those who in doubt please look no further than the below statement from the last ER:Splunk ended the quarter with total annual recurring revenues (“ARR”) of $2.37 billion, up 40.8% year over year. Cloud ARR soared 83.3% year over year to $810 million."
"Ok, guys. I have been sitting on this dud at a loss forever. This thing has been such a disappointment. I am no Babe Ruth or Jackie Robinson, but my batting average is pretty good...but, I sure struck out with SPLK. In fact, Splunk is the sound my money made when it fell down into the sewer. I will make you guys a deal. I am going to hold this thing. I have nothing to lose at this point. I will hold it and if it EVER breaks 200 again, then the drinks are on me. But, I don't think that I am going to be buying any drinks any time soon unfortunately."
Another slow start to the week. Going to trend down to mid 130's go it will go above 142 this week ;)
Ark/cathie woods has purchased quite a bit of splunk in the last 2 days. It should strengthen the momentum!
We need big volume.We need it above 150$.
Institution's are obviously selling this stock for some reason.
"breaking: Splunk price target raised to $254 from $203 at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin raised the firm's price target on Splunk (SPLK) to $254 from $203 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. In light of the current interest rate environment, the analyst adjusted assumptions in the discounted cash flow component of his valuation methodology, which drives increased price targets across the software sector. The ""resiliency"" of the sector throughout COVID-19 underscores the ""criticality"" of many software categories as businesses adjust for more distributed workforces and therefore require modernized cloud systems, Merwin tells investors in a research note. With sector multiples at all-time highs, the analyst favors stocks where he sees ""compelling relative value."" Merwin's best ideas currently are ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk, Alteryx (AYX)"
 I just bought Splunk. I’m not into fundamentals but most likely to technical analysis. However Splunk should bounce up because it’s Oversold right now and hit same old support level $151 which is strong one and ut should bounce up tomorrow and this week.If the earnings went good it should back to $180-$200 .
Hope SPLK doing the same as PAWN after earning reports today

I’m average at 141.77 lol

"Breaking: Splunk price target raised to $245 from $195 at Barclays, maintains OverweightBarclays analyst Raimo Lenschow raised the firm's price target on Splunk to $245 from $195 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Digital transformation is ""no longer a marketing phrase, but due to the pandemic, it has turned into a real demand driver,"" Lenschow tells investors in a research note following a virtual bus tour with software companies."
"Maybe the biggest driver in SPLK's price decline has been the large amounts of SPLK sold in the ARKK fund. Another factor is the persistent losses SPLK generates. I have been an owner for seven years and a big fan, but the business model has to turn the corner. The prediction that their client base will buy into the cloud service may be the latest excuse."
"Can’t hold, seems like downward trend"
"As everyone know, this discounted price is due to negative fluctuation of revenue in last quarters. However, it is just a transition period. When its trend become positive again, this stock will exceed 300$ in a few months."
Earnings coming soon. I don't think this will be our big happy quarter but the next one should show some sexy

"I was holding Splunk for more than a year and wrote many comments on this board.At that time the Nasdaq was up 50%, competitors like Datagdog doubled and SPLK barely moved.Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a great company.But I am not sure it is a good pick right now when the market is that high.In the last quarter after they lost 471 millions, I decided that if they lose more than 200 millions in the next quarter I am out. It's true there were companies in the past losing money and turning to be profitable.But not all companies and even Salesforce which is a huge company never lost that much money in one quarter. Look what happened with WIX. They beat earnings every quarter but because of their losses, the stock is now around 200$ after it was trading at 360$ a few months ago. Good luck longs."
Yeah market is getting boring how about we make some upgrades:))
"To all the shorts. Please read between the lines. “The initial conversion price of $160.00 represents a 30% premium to the volume-weighted average closing price of the Common Stock over a 10-day period ending on June 21, 2021.”"
I am holding hard on SPLK! entered at 142.5! I am not worried about my investment long term. Would enjoy seeing momentum upwards! STAY LONG & GET RICH!
"Next quarters, strengten financial results will lead to increase it over 200$ again."

The stock is up as there are rumours on the Street that NVIDIA is building new Cybersecurity framework (Morpheus AI) that will be run on Splunk.At this price Splunk becomes an easy target for acquisition.
"If I am remembering correctly, Q1’s pull back was blamed on the switch too a subscription model but the stock had also run.... In Q2 the analysts were already aware of this change, but it seemed there was confusion to the payment model of a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 resulting in cash flow head winds. Hopefully management will provide more clarity on the call this time around.. but as per the call there may be one more 1/4 of lower cash flow . Does this sound correct? If someone more knowledgeable then me would care too add or correct anything please do. Thanks"

Kaboom
"From May 22 till Dec 01, Splunk was trading between 185$ to 225$. From Dec 1 till today, Nasdaq was adding about 15% and Splunk was down almost 40% from its average price in the above period. Unlike other growth stocks, Splunk is down 40% from the average price it was trading for over 6 months. You can see that all Splunk's competitors such as Palantir, Sumo Logic and Datadog also dropped sharply but from their all times high that last only for a few days or weeks. My point is that Splunk is a stable company with more than $1 billion cash flow over the next year and it still trading for only 10 times from its revenue. I don't care about all the BUY ratings it gets, all tech companies get BUY ratings and many of them with a huge upside of more than 50%. If you believe Big Data is the future, you better choose a value company that is still cheap. Just be patient and you will get a 50% profit in 2021."
Going to be a good week! GREEN PLEASE!
Time in the market is more important than timing the market. Shorts should have cover at 110. More pain is coming for shorts.

"Where is gary lol. I see splunk hitting either 170 or 180 in a month or so. Cathy is also back. Good signs for us,"
Looks like profit taking after big gains. Should good back up over the next few months if market does not crash. In at $159 after cost avging. Will hold until back in the 170s.
