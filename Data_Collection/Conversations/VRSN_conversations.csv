"Let's look at VRSN fundamentals to see what the fair value is right now vs. the market price.First, let's look at growth numbers: Sales up 5.9% over the past five years and sales up 3.7% in the most recent quarter. Earnings are expected to increase by 8% over the next five years and 6.1% in the next quarter. Return on Equity is a negative 38%. This would normally translate into a relative p/e to the market (S & P 500) of a discount as the growth numbers are less than the market, but the stock has a 5 year relative p/e of 134%, meaning it normally trades at a 34% premium to the market. Using the consensus forward earnings estimate next year of $4.72 VRSN is actually trading at a premium of 63%. The S & P 500 has a one year forward P/E of 18 which we will use to calculate the fair value for VRSN:The fair value is 4.72 x 1.34 x 18 = $114Current market price is $139.VRSN's stock price is overvalued and can be expected to drop down to its fair value unless earnings increase substantially over the next few quarters."

"Been a long long time since I posted here (had a super old account that's no long active) as I've owned VRSN since the year 2000 and rode this from 56 to 156 all the way down to the teens and now back here to see things finally back where we belong. Anyhow, good luck to all holders here and looking forward to seeing what we can do this year. The board looks pretty quiet here but does anybody here remember flash and hatedbutright? Those 2 were quite the opposing forces back in the day I can tell ya"

"Verisign reports earnings 4/25/2019. Anyone here thinking they'll report blowout earnings? The consensus EPS estimate is $1.25. But Baird reported that Verisign Inc was up 1.2 pct as their pricing power is projected to lift revenue up to 6% in 2020. IMO, the real surprise with Verisign is that only three analysts cover it - when IT services like these are such a powerhouse and fuel the economy of much of the online business market."
