Any thoughts on what the dividend may be raised to??
And here we go again... oscillating in the $2s
"Warren Buffet likes buying Natural Gas storage and transmission at a 10B valuation. Why is he the greatest value Investor of all time? Because he only buys companies when the intrinsic value of the underlying assets is greater than what he pays for the stock. What is the intrinsic value of cclp's assets? I would think the approximate 15m cash in the bank, the manufacturing facility maybe 8m, the discounted value of the compressors at 900m less the debt of approximately 650m leaves 273m equity for shareholders. 273m/47m units is 5.80 per share. I own many hundreds of thousands of units of cclp. When I see Management either declare a buyback or start buying 50,000 units minimum I will consider doubling my stake. Theoretically, the company could liquidate and I would make over 600 percent. Patience will be rewarded. Warren Buffet knows natural gas is not going away soon. There will be a large run-up which started today as the earnings have to be way higher than last quarter for two reasons, the debt write off and the additional 30m in equipment sale this quarter"
"hopefully CCLP gets a share of this workFeb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. energy regulators said this week that they have given Cheniere Energy Inc approval to build all of the company's roughly $1 billion proposed Midship natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma.In December, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized Midship to build the first 186 miles (299 kilometers) of the mainline pipe and associated infrastructure."
I am going to hold through earnings... anyone else?
"hopefully 2021 will be the year for the new CCLP - without the burden and uncertainty of their mfg business but with solid and consistent income from their core business -- many companies have ventured off into a related business and find that they had to bail out, take their lumps and move on - hopefully learning an expensive lesson."
CSI Compressco is up 9.82% to 1.23
"INTI -- CSI Compressco (NASDAQ:CCLP): Q3 GAAP EPS of -$0.25 beats by $0.08.Revenue of $79.16M (-30.4% Y/Y) beats by $1.65M.Distributable cash flow of $10.5M, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 21.9x."
"CCLP quietly starting to kick into high gear! Their skills and services will be in STRONG DEMAND soon, esp. if Iran unrest brings turmoil and imbalance to the oil markets."
I'm not sure there will be a dividend anytime soon..even after preferred's have settled. natural gas is cheap and they need the price to rally to get more biz.
"Jerome no doubt about it that the communication has been once the preferred was paid the distribution would resume. In the short run very disappointing to those who are after yield (virtually everyone who invests in a mlp). If you go back 5 years you can see the fundamentals have never been better. The only problem is the share count has risen. GP owns way more units than we do. I would argue along with you that they have our best interest at stake. I own more than a couple hundred thousand units and buy more most days. So if I can continue to acquire a company earning 60 percent next year on my entry price why do I want them to triple the price instead if buying back units on the cheap. Clearly it's better for them to spend 30m in buy backs instead of distributions. They understand this now, maybe before they were sensitive to the huge drop in unit price but once the yield went away and short term holders they realized what is best for the holders is to get the outstanding units down. My projection shows 1.50 dcf within 24 months if they hold off on distribution and just buy back. I will retire on this investment."
"Did I miss something? Andysbling. You have misleading people for three years and I do not know if you worked for the company because you have been repeating the same story for years.(Three is plural).You and what his name oh! Jerome. You two have not answer my questions, but I know the true hurts a lot. Related to the company, this the four year with a negative income and you have to add that they are surviving because Tetra is paying the equipment. After the company released their balance its stock fell down like they have fallen down for ""how many years Andysbling? and then, there is a guy hopelessly asking to this company gets a pipeline project. Many of the stock companies put on hold this stock. why?, Maybe because a .01 div."
Great Earnings
lots of pipeline work going on - all that requires compression - cclp should have a very good Q
"Well, another loss. It will be interesting to see what the fleet utilization and the backorders are.Also in question is the free cash flow coverage for the distribution going forward"
"Interesting: Poor quarter due to timing issues it seems. Management reaffirms full year outlook and forecast. If that forecast does hold, the 2nd half of the year could be really strong. Almost done with the preferred. After that, focus on meeting increased demand through increased growth capex, aiming at 4.5x leverage and reinitiating payout at a higher level...all in all, we are still in a waiting pattern but for those who are patient, a $3 unit seems really low one year out from here given underlying strength in compressor market."
How does a company recover from a negative income for many years without going to bankruptcy and executives buying shares when the company is not in the best economical shape?
"So the dividend is announced, unchanged, and the stock right now is 4.81 with a paltry yield of 15.59%.Go figure, Mr. Market."
"CSI Compressco LP Announces Debt Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation[PR Newswire]PR NewswireApril 17, 2020THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- CSI Compressco LP (""CSI Compressco"" or the ""Partnership"") (NASDAQ: CCLP) and the Partnership's wholly owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco Finance Inc. (""Finance Corp"" and, together with the Partnership, the ""Issuers"") today announced that they have commenced an offer to certain Eligible Holders (as defined below) described below to exchange any and all of their outstanding 7.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 (the ""Unsecured Notes"") for newly issued 7.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the ""New First Lien Notes"") and 7.250% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2027 (the ""New Second Lien Notes"" and, together with the New First Lien Notes, the ""New Notes""), upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Confidential Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement dated April 17, 2020 (the ""Exchange Offer"").The table below summarizes the principal economic terms of the Exchange Offer. Principal Amount of New First LienNotes per $1,000 Principal Amount ofUnsecured Notes Tendered Principal Amount of New Second LienNotes per $1,000 Principal Amount ofUnsecured Notes TenderedCUSIP Number of 20467BAB5Unsecured NotesPrincipalAmount ofUnsecuredNotesOutstanding $295,930,0Total $700Consideration ifTendered Priorto the EarlyTender TimeTenderN/AConsideration ifTendered After theEarly TenderTime(2) Total$750Consideration ifTendered Priorto the EarlyTender Time(1) Tender$700Consideration ifTendered After theEarly Tender Time(2) (1) Includes the Early Tender Payment (as defined below).(2) Holders who tender after the Early Tender Time (as defined below) will only receive New Second Lien Notes.Eligible Holders that validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Unsecured Notes in the Exchange Offer prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 30, 2020 (the ""Early Tender Time"") will receive $700 in principal amount of New First Lien Notes or, as applicable and subject to proration as described below, $750 principal amount of New Second Lien Notes for each $1,000 principal amount of Unsecured Notes tendered, which includes an ""Early Tender Payment"" of $50 in principal amount of New Notes per $1,000 principal amount of Unsecured Notes tendered. Eligible Holders that validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Unsecured Notes in the Exchange Offer after the Early Tender Time will not be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment and will receive $700 in principal amount of New Second Lien Notes per $1,000 principal amount of Unsecured Notes. No New First Lien Notes will be issued to Eligible Holders who tender their Unsecured Notes after the Early Tender Time.The New First Lien Notes are being offered as additional notes under an indenture pursuant to which the Issuers issued $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes on March 22, 2018 (the ""Initial First Lien Notes""). The New First Lien Notes will have identical terms as the Initial First Lien Notes, other than the New First Lien Notes are expected to be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the New First Lien Notes and the Initial First Lien Notes will be treated as a single class of securities under such indenture. Because the New First Lien Notes are expected to be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New First Lien Notes are not expected to be fungible for trading purposes with the Initial First Lien Notes and will trade under different CUSIP numbers.The New First Lien Notes and the related guarantees will be secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the Partnership's assets other than certain excluded property and the collateral securing the Partnership's credit facility (such collateral, the ""Notes Collateral""). The New Second Lien Notes will be secured by a second-priority security interest in the Notes Collateral. All untendered Unsecured Notes will be effectively junior to the New Notes and the Initial First Lien Notes as to such Notes Collateral.All New First Lien Notes will be issued before any New Second Lien Notes are issued to Eligible Holders. The New Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer will consist of up to $50.0 million principal amount of New First Lien Notes and up to $168.4 million of New Second Lien Notes. We will not issue more than $50 million aggregate principal amount of New First Lien Notes. In the event that an aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes are tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time such that the amount of New First Lien Notes would exceed $50 million, the amount of New First Lien Notes issue"
"Another day studying the industry in particular AROC. AROC in their last conference call said they are turning away business because of the amount of capital required to service new build demand. AROC discloses like CCLP the amount of new horsepower coming online and the cost of the horsepower. I researched comparable acquisitions of company horsepower and the range is $900 to 1,250 depending on where in the cycle the purchase took place. So I see Moody's rates everyone's debt as B1 essentially junk and think to myself. CCLP is worth north of $7 if the company liquidates and sells all its equipment at $900 per horsepower and pays off its creditors. From my experience dealing with Lenders CCLP's debt is not junk but gold. There is zero risk that the lender is under collateralized"
Interesting how the 2.5 July/October have almost no premium associated with them. I guess they are now deep in the money...almost tempted to punt on the $5 Oct calls...still trading at a very low premium...I think we could see $5ish by the end of the summer once the preferred are out...thoughts?
the recent debt conversion should be very good news - they will be able to issue new debt at a better rate for longer out + still looking forward to the sale of their mfg facility which should do wonders for their financial position
"Not many shares available today, not selling mine till it goes back to at least $12"
"Has anyone considered this.....Cancellation of Debt Income (CODI) is phantom income that partnership unit holders (equity holders) can have to claim on their taxes even though they don’t receive any cash. The simplified version is if a partnership owed $100 million but $30 million of that was forgiven via a debt swap, GAAP requires the partnership to report that difference as $30 million worth of income on their P&L which then become taxable. Assuming 80% of the debt is converted, the highest amount I can imagine given that only institutional investors can convert, CODI could represent $1.50 worth of phantom income per share."
The price ran 43 percent in a few weeks and nobody posted...odd
You have to figure that today was firmly in the blackout period for insiders so today’s action has to come from outside with perhaps some better knowledge of the latest on compression. Given today’s action I can predict this going to $3.90 and above $4 if any news on when they will raise dividends
"A metric I have used in investing for 3 decades may seem very simplistic. Are you ready for my secret sauce? I have bought over 12 businesses and invested in dozens more in the stock market. First observation is how much cash flow does the business enjoy? Second observation is how much do I pay for that cash flow. Third observation is what are the assets that provide that cash flow, and what condition are those assets. Additionally, I want to know about the likelihood that the cash flow will continue. The CFO made a comment on the conference call which was compelling. He mentioned cash flow as a percentage of market cap. As of Friday's close the cash flow as a percentage of market cap is 60 percent. So if you could buy $500,000 of this company theoretically you could enjoy $300,000 in cash flow. What Management does with the cash flow in the short run is accumulate it to retire debt coming due in two years. I have never seen an investment that is returning 60 percent on an annual basis ever. As a CPA I am very comfortable reconciling book loss to cash flow. It's actually a simple process. Management reconciles beginning cash to ending cash with every quarterly report. They provide EBITDA, and they provide the depreciation which you can add back to the book loss. I believe in 2022when Management retires the debt things are going to get very interesting."
My prognostication is the company will report .36 DCF on November 6. Anyone else care to estimate what the Company will report?
"Well, now we know why the stock dropped 50% in the last two weeks. Insiders knew ahead of time the distribution would be cut. It makes sense for them to do this right now. As far as bankruptcy, that's not going to happen. They have other options in the event the free cash flow is not sufficient to cover the operations and debt load. The GP can step in with additional cash or they can private placement additional shares to raise cash. I'm going to average cost buy shares today. At this price there isn't much to lose."
Report and guidance look great and its full steam ahead...cclp will evaluate Divi in 2nd half 2019 and hopefully we will be rewarded for our wait..
Because the competitors have large yields and large dividends we get stuck with a valuation of 2.5x cash flow of the business. Our yield of 1.4% versus 13.5 for USAC explains Analyst valuations of 10x for them verus 6x for us. Perhaps there is a middle ground. Management establishes a market yield of 30 cents payable at .075 per quarter. It tells the public that it has 4x coverage and will reevaluate it's distribution policy based upon market conditions and growth requirements and its stated goal of reducing leverage to 4.5x. Investors are rewarded for waiting and income investors return to capture yield. There would still be plenty of cash to meet the company's objectives.
"I see the share price is currently $3.10I like the stock a lot, but will wait to see if we have a pull back to around $2.60 or so."
It’s about time for a buyout offer. GLTA
Will these stocks get pricey close to the quarterly distribution and full year results (2018) and fall after the release of this information like they have been done for three year in a row or they will keep their price?
"Exxon reported today ""a bright spot for Exxon was oil and gas production rising 7 percent to 3.9 million barrels per day. Output in the top U S. Shale field, the Permian Basin Rose to 274,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 90 percent from a year ago."
Nice...
Nice.. when other OFS companies are testing new lows you might expect CCLP sp to have dropped back down to 2018YE levels. Impressive that it has not. Perhaps analysts are finally starting to understand the fundamentals that drive CCLP performance?
"Recovery is well underway! A great harbinger is the order backlog which continues to grow gangbusters.....steadily improving margins are also key as EBITDA grows, and they have all the financing in place as needed. Watch what happens as stock flies in 2019. It's mostly Permian folks and CCLP is so well positioned there!"

"I expect years of capital expenditure to secure more ""energy independence"" from the US. This should benefit CCLP greatly. This stock is probably one of the cheapest out there. They are done with their preferred stock. Things could get interesting now with debt repurchases, unit repurchases and higher payouts. If it were a C corp, this thing would fly. It is in this no man's land of MLP without decent payout. It could certainly change with payout resuming at higher levels as of year end but I would rather they do unit repurchases first and soak up as many units as possible and only then increase payout..."
"Clearly, we've hitched our wagon to a stump. Company news release and revision of guidance this a.m. I'm holding for now. GLTA"
Just buy it for the dividend.
So Ended in green territory. Manipulation to draw more in or all the downside risk now factored in? We know that Q1 is good due to their order book and new pipelines that are being built to debottleneck permian
CCLP climbing on good volume today -- about time!
Note - FTSI [well fracking/completion company] did fairly well on their recent rpt and jumped from .50 to 1.40 in last two daysCCLP is in much more solid shape with WAY better backlog and revenue stream -
looking forward to the CC in a couple weeks -- sp action is very encouraging
Am really glad I stayed through earnings and now look forward to the distribution in my portfolio mid month!
"Anyone out there? I bought another 10,000 shares after learning about the Elite sale at $953 per hp. That transaction values us at over 1.1B less debt. Elite sells off it's low hp before the deal and the next week cclp files an 8k notifying it's low compressor guy gets a payout if there is a change in control. Can the tea leaves I am reading be any more obvious? Is the investing public so lazy that they can't put 2 and 2 together. Comments please!"
Alright after selling at $3.50 post earnings I just got back in at $2.80. The price is getting too low even if the dist ends up being smaller and delayed to Q2 of next year.
"I will expect Yahoo not to delete what I am going to write as an answer for Luke.You have been mislead people for long time about the CSI Compressco, but If it is your way of life, that's your problem. Luke, you lasted 5 years to give that kind of answer as a signal of victory, five years whoa, but you forgot something, Income loss:12,000,000 and a warning of delisting from NASDAQ. CSI Compressco sold its equipment, old compressors to get these results this correct . Sorry, they are in Survival mode. I am going to finish with beautiful phrase: "" I do not know about yall but I am looking forward to next Q and try to mislead more people"". I am still blaming the CSI compressor people during the company transition into CSI Compressco that made a lot mistakes when they made decisions to try to make this company profitable."
CCLP reached a 52 Week low at 2.13
"Just learning about the company and industry. I understand gas compression equipment is used both in the collection phase and distribution phase. Can someone tell me if CSI's equipment is used for both. I called the company and they said the 800m to 900m of deployed equipment lasts much longer than the remaining 5 year lease. Just invested a 100k, thinking of buying another 100k. Seems like a no brainier when the dividend comes back in q4. I understand from the guidance 59m free cash flow of which 30m is going to retire dilutive series A. So 29m left to distribute at year end. Can someone tell me based on history how much of the dividend is sheltered on their annual K1?"
great acqusition target!
I don't know about yall but I am looking forward to next Q rpt coming out in a few weeks -- should be a new day for CCLP as they have sold the manufacturing facility and all associated burdens and move forward as a more pure play compression and maintenance company with much better contracts than they had in the last big O&G down-turn -- likely will be some big one-time expenses but all other should be positive
"I would like to modify my original thoughts on the company as I have now received more information and invested more time in studying the history of the company. The new information I have studied is various analyst reports by both Wells and Stifel. Management of Publicly Traded companies have a tension between low trading prices and running the business. So what we have here is a business that is doing very well from a business perspective and very poorly from a unit price perspective. The question is how do you try and reconcile the current situation, a company booming in exercising on its business plan with a sub optimal market valuation. I previously thought the company would have large phantom income and would have to start paying a large dividend next year. I no longer hold this opinion. Reports are that 80% of the company's income is tax sheltered. Company's stated objective is bring leverage down from over 6x to 4.5x. This is not going to happen from paying a market rate dividend. It will be achieved from investing cash flow into the business while simultaneously paying down debt. The valuation in this industry is all over the board. You can see 6x to 10x Ebitda. Within a few months the Analysts covering the company modify their projections from 8.5x to a lower multiple. So investors have to decide whether to invest in growth or income. This space is usually where investors seeking income play. Now no real income and a large shift in the business plan to reduce leverage. It seems the GP had to make the investment in capex so as to not disappoint a major customer. Seems like a reasonable course of action. The company's amended credit facility is driving the future of the business along with Management's desire to avert a crazy dilutive capital raise like the last one. I think Investors are going to be patient here and let Management execute on their business plan and reduce the outstanding debt. The stock should increase in value after each quarter as Mangement reduces the book loss and increases cash flow from growth and pricing increases."
"Wait a minute! Per Stifel March 1, 2019. ""Furthermore, CCLP remains committed to reducing leverage to 4.5x or better. We currently estimate over 6.0x leverage (sub 5.5x annualizing 4q18), but estimate a decline to 5.2x by YE 19 (4.8x annualizing 4q10) and to management's target of 4.5x by 2020."" Now per the 10Q Series A Preferred UnitsBecause the Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, the fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 480 ""Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity."" The fair value of the Preferred Units as of December 31, 2018 was $30.9 million. Changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To calculate the estimated fair value of our Preferred Units, we utilize market information related to debt instruments, the trading price of our common units, and lattice modeling techniques. Because the Preferred Units are convertible into our common units at the option of the holder, the fair value of the Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price of our common units, and this increase/decrease in Preferred Unit fair value will be charged/credited to earnings. Because of the volatility of market factors inherent in the estimation of the fair value of the Preferred Units, including the trading price of our common units, the volatility of our earnings may increase while the Preferred Units are outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Preferred Units decreased to $30.9 million, resulting in $0.8 million credited to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.If our debt is 645,940 and we are paying off 4.1m per month of debt on the 8th of each month using Managements upper guidance of 140m EBITDA 4.5x140M=630M of debt we can deleverage to 4.5x by Christmas and still receive dividends next year."
Got my divvie today didn't wait to spend it on csi bonds trading at a 25 percent discount
Needed this
just thinking - when I first bought this stock near the ipo it was paying around 6.5% - and it still is -- what has changed? IMO Mgmt should not get any more option/restricted shares than they got when the stock was in the mid teens -- they should not be allowed to benefit from this terrible sp
I rarely stay through earnings on small and mid caps.. but I just didn’t see how this could be a bad call.. not with the pipeline backlog in the permian
CSI Compressco is up 8.65% to 1.13
hope CCLP got the business on this -- lots of big compressionhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3528299-cheniere-raises-midship-cost-estimate-sees-service-starting-in-april?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha
"Anyone buying at a market cap of $100M? The debt is over $500M...this is a LEVERAGED play on any sort of continuation for this business. Can someone explain to me exactly why they cannot cut the distribution and pay down debt instead? It might actually save them from BK. I am not sure I am seeing a greater imperative than avoiding BK when the business is actually doing quite well (Q3 was very healthy, guidance was too!)."

"latest news. On December 20, 2018, CSI Compressco LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the""Partnership"") issued a press release announcing an update on fourth quarter2018 guidance and providing guidance on total year 2019. The Partnership alsoannounced in the press release that it intends to reduce its quarterly cashdistributions to the Partnership's common unit holders for a period of up to thenext four quarters. The Partnership intends to use the approximately $34 millionof reduced distributions to redeem the remaining Series A preferred units forcash and avoid further dilution to the Partnership's common unit holders. Theredemption of the Series A preferred units is expected to be completed by thethird quarter of 2019, at which time management and the Board of Directors ofthe Partnership's general partner will re-evaluate the distribution policy basedon business conditions at that time.

"Now, CSI Compressco does not have a plant to hit the books. Oh sorry, they have a equipment auction next month, maybe they are going to hit the books next Q. with that money. Just I wonder how many people were layoff, just to see if the have enough people to layoff and hit the books again. How are they going to maintenance the equipment in the field without a truck base if they sold the plant. The entire oil and gas industry is still collapse. Who was the company that bought the plant maybe they can help CSI Compresscoand rent CSI Compressco the backyard to keep the maintenance trucks? I think they are going to be delistedon December. Remember the ""low season"" in the oil and gas industry starts next month."
It’s official. The only thing that moves this above $4... is an increase in the distribution
Incredibly cheap at all time lows. This is a company that just reported very healthy operations. They are buying back debt with all their excess free cash flow. Seems like a steal at these prices...
Yeah there should be a backlog of work with more capacity as they put in new pipelines
"New.., honesty was doing my due diligence and found CCLP.. a little nervous about the the recent news... any advice I’m in at .54 but reading some of these comments have me wondering if this is a pump & dump?"
Should be distribution announcement coming soon. My guess is this week. Hope they do it right.
Qtr report..my take till a smart one follows....good Qtr but it will be used as a rainy day fund to help them thru a slower next qtr and a general slowdown in buis down the road..debt level now down to 5.1×...game plan is to save as much as they can..keep paying off debt..got a heavy debtload in 2022 to cover and then maybe if the industry is churning again..maybe finally raising the Distro...Dunno..things could change between now and then..im staying on the sidelines till further notice...
another big pipe - requiring lots of compressionhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/enable-midstream-plans-interstate-natural-100000074.html
"On Thursday an article published on Seeking Alpha under CCLP's major competitor, AROC makes a STRONG case for the entire gas compression space. Extremely bullish article (I meen - EXTREMELY BULLISH). Please read, then reply to this question; Given the mergers and acquisitions of the NOW top 2 companies, how likely do you think that the NOW #3 (CCLP) COULD see merger (i.e. TTI merging with the remaining 19 million shares of CCLP) OR an acquisition by ?? (undetermined Company, or group of Companies)?"
"60m projected and publicly announced cash flow or after tax cash flow keeps the company and Investors very happy. Negative income is an accounting concept defined as expenses in excess of revenue. This company's major expense is depreciation which is an accounting concept not cash flow concept. President Trump has negative taxable income and pays no income tax as a result of depreciation. It's not income that pays for goods and services, it's cash flow and cclp has close to 60m of it."
looks like they missed by a penny - but are sitting on a boat load of orders and much better financing than they had in the past
No news..nothings changed..wuzzzz up?
"Did a deep dive into insider sentiment for the volumes of natural gas going forward. Everyone was bullish so I bought a substantial amount of CSIs trading volume last week. The company will release record earnings and DCF yet the price is near a record low. They paid 10x EBITDA for Compressor Systems or 825m to become what they are today. This was $961/h.p. Today we trade at $681 per horsepower. The company trades at a fraction of EBITDA, and the USAC and AROC comps on our service business alone would value us at between 537.5 -337.5M. How does a company cash flowing between 55m and 59m have a 95m market value in an industry that quite frankly is robust? It's really quite simple the leverage is high and there is no yield. If you listen to USAC's conference call and listen to AROC's conference call you know exactly what CSI will say on Wednesday. I like knowing what a company will announce before they announce it.1. Customers are being very disciplined with capital allocation. 2. Growth Capex is being cut in 2020 by CSI. 3. We remain positive in future volumes of natural gas. 4. Price increases will be moderate for 2020. 5. Leverage expected to be 4.69 by year end. Only unknown is whether any discussion of capital allocation strategy specifics. Meanwhile I gobble this up at 65 percent return on capital ( next year's DCF/today's market cap)."
going to $4
so they sold their mfg plant for 17M - to hit the books in Q3 + they will cut labor costs via the sale + they still have more inventory sales in Q3 + compression services looking great and customer production waking up = so that seems to be a big burden lifted off CCLP which should result in the sp finally heading back north
"CCLP bonds (7.25% due 8/15/22 - 20467BAB5) subject to an exchange offer. Offer is restricted to 144A holders - BIG holders, million $ holders. Exchange agreement before 4/28: $700 for each $1,000 bond (and in limited upper exchange limits $750). Still at 7.25%. I am not a million $ holder BUT this does not seem a great exchange offer. Anyone else ave this offer and Have an opinion?"
"The concept of Negative income is called ""loosing money"" every year, if you spend more money than your revenues guess what is going to happened?. How did they get the 60m.? Maybe TTI is contributing to the 60m. Less revenue , less cash , less dividends, less everything. You have to thanks TTI.Relate to President Trump, I think he did not check his income before to get into bankruptcy for how many times?. Negative Income is a sign that your are loosing money, not good for the business.Are you working for this company? Because, how do you know that the company and Investor are happy?"
"Just bought more. Go to SA to find very thoughtful recent articles and discussions on this one. Not worth repeating it here. This one is a steal by any metric. Management is soaking up the preferred. No more crazy dilution. Underlying business is very strong. Multibagger potential here. Distribution will resume after Q3 once all preferred are out of the way. They will have enough for distribution and growth. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
CSI Compressco is up 11.48% to 1.36
"This says it all: ""Year-to-date through September, we have received nearly $170 million in new orders, many of which are filling up our 2019 order book already. This is a record for CSI Compressco, and we still have 3 months to go."" ===> There's no doubt equipment buildouts will keep CCLP cranking! The divvy is GRAVY!"
Market down BIG today....CCLP is holding its own!
The rush by infrastructure companies to build/expand new pipelines and other oil transport mechanisms will bode well for CCLP. Producers are even desperate to get old rail facilities back on line to transport oil.
Doubling the distribution would send a very positive message.
"hope CCLP got this job = Three compressor stations totaling 114,650 horsepower (HP)One booster compressor station with installed horsepower of 2,760 hphttps://www.midshippipeline.com/about-the-project/"
Nice bounce back today after some downward movement.....confirms any attempted manipulation won't keep this stock down. It's all upward from here folks.
cclp market cap now higher than tti.
"""The final cash redemption of Series A Convertible Preferred Units will occur on August 8, 2019, after which all Series A Preferred Units will be fully redeemed. "" sooo then they will announce resumption of the dividends"
I assume they are still on schedule for the Q on the 24th - that will be very interesting.
A big Insider buy... first in a long time.
it appears the only eyes on this stock are shareholders pondering when to sell and walk awaymgmt needs to put some positive spin on this thing with a small distribution increase announcementthey have done what they planned with the distribution funds and it is time they bet back to shareholder valueQ will tell us how many shares they passed out to management on the cheap
"Just in from AROC earnings transcript CEONow, let me update our take on the market. The market for US contract compression remains extremely strong, backed by a high-level of customer demand, long lead times for new equipment and strong utilization of compression equipment overall. Conversation with customers regarding their future compression needs together with market forecasts for natural gas production increases give me confidence that there continues to be increasing long-term demand for our services across geographies. This would include in the Permian, the Eagle Ford and Niobrara, Marcellus, and Utica Shale place.Our book of business is robust with strategic customers planning well in advance for their compression needs and placing orders up to a year in advance and at attractive pricing levels. As I've said for several quarters in a row, our customer commitments for contract compression horsepower to be placed into service in 2019, and even extending into 2020 remained at elevated levels. Indeed, nearly 95% of the new horsepower of which we will take delivery in 2019 has already been committed and contracted with our customers.In addition to positive indications from our customers and near-term market forecasts, the long-term macro backdrop continues to support the profitable expansion of our business. US natural gas production is forecasted to increase over 7 Bcf a day or about 9% in 2019. Our production increased for the US for the second -- only to the record natural gas production increase we experienced in 2018. Rising US natural gas production and demand for compression is a result of the sustained structural increase in the global demand for and an expanding use of natural gas. It is not merely driven by commodity price cycles."
"another observation based on some of my other investments- Cheniere is currently the Midship Pipeline [48"" pipe] down through OK -- ENBL has 4 connections to that pipe + several other pipeline outfits - all of this requires large compression units - that are currently being installed - Im just guessing some of that is CCLP --- looking forward to the upcoming QtrlyCC"
Gary: Its been two years. I dont see CCLP making any progress on the debt and there is a looming deadline in August. What do you think now? Will the new partner bail them out?
"This is incredibly cheap. No one is touching it: MLP with poor GP, barely any distribution, and oil ""service provider"" industry. Three strikes you are out...but the underlying fundamentals are as strong as ever. Everything is going right. Paying down the debt is smart. When back down to 4.5 EBITDA, they will do the refinancing and start distributing more...at least that is the stated goal. Huge disappointment a month ago when they said the increased in payouts would be delayed until those events happen. Most people thought: Once the preferreds are gone, dividends go up. Instead, excess CF goes to Capex and debt repayment. I think it is smart given underlying strength (especially in bigger horsepower compressors where they are still lagging somewhat) and debt overhang. Once that is cleared, this firm will be in great shape...$2.33 is a true bargain."
"Sorry for all my typos and grammatical mistakes, not easy to post in bed by a cell phone but you get the gist. Hopefully my analysis is insightful."
Really quiet stock. But the fact that it barely budged when the rest of the market was red is very promising.
Now that Saudis are gonna open the spigots I don't fancy the chances of a CCLP recovery in the foreseeable future. Lots of shale operators will be struggling in a major way going forward.
Dreaming of 17m cash flow and a large international order.
CCLP is up 19.43% to 7.50
"Amazing, they are still giving div. It is looks like the plan is: first, to move shares among the top players to attracts victims.Second, Debt Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation just for specific shareholders to get more time to the inevitable, ""bankruptcy"",and third, just to see if they are still have support from some cheerleaders like Jerome, AndySibling, Luke , etc.It is not the Corona Virus-19 or the oil bust today, this problem started from the CSI management that was in charge when they become CSI Compressco. They were giving Dividends when the situation was not the appropriate in the 2014-15 oil bust."
I will be holding [and adding to] this one while watching them rebuild -- they took a beating in '17 and appear to be recovering at a pretty rapid pace - all metrics are improving and I expect the SP will also improve as they complete repurchase of the preferred units and follow on this fall with their go-forward dividend - I live in OK and see LOTS of drilling and pipeline activity supporting some of the sales and backlog they talked about in the cc
I can see AROC interested if they can do something with the mfg company. They have the balance sheet to do the deal. .
New CEO at TTI (the GP). Long and strong!
I lost confidence in management and their ability to make a profit to pay dividend.
"I’ve been riding this out at a cost basis of $3. Unfortunately, my stop loss kicked in at $3.50. I’d rather make 15% profit than no profit at all. I was really hoping for a solid $4 price to stick, but the earnings call today really hurt. They really needed to use the opportunity to confirm a new dist strategy with all the EBITDA. They failed to do so and it felt more like they would use the funds to pay down debt and increase growth rather than on a dist in the future. I hope their position changes but that’s the main reason for the sell off today. May jump back in if the price is right. Just worried with the current market conditions that this could see $3 again before it sees $4."
Sweeping management changes going on at CSI. Most of the new officers are coming from Spartan Energy. Anyone know what all this means. Bonds say the financial structure is substantially improved.
I know that when cramer recommends a stock it’s like the kiss of death... didn’t realize a recommendation from Zacks would have the same negative impact!
Just bought more at 2.265.
Well..your dream cash flow got to 16..close but no cigar but you got that large International order!...They posted a great quarter and will continue next as well..they at 1st mentioned that over 50% of their extra cash would go to Stakeholders but no mention of Divi increase out of that..waiting for CC...they want to be in a strong position in 2020 to refinance some Debt...
Anyone know if this stock pays quarterly or annually?
Go CCLP. Trump's trade deals should be good in the long run.
This stock looks really interesting. I’ve had good success with USAC and I’m now buying into CCLP at $3. I think this will go to $4 by Sept and I suspect they will pay an 8% dividend at that share price so locking in now might be the best investment I make the rest of the year. Go LONGS!
"CCLP bonds (7.25% due 8/15/22, CUSIP 20467BAB5) are drifting about in recovery territory - last traded today at 95 and Yielding 11.269% to Maturity in 17 months - (FINRA - http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C635989). I cannot believe the powers at Compresso would let this bond default at this crucial time - with oil prices drifting higher. Anyone out there with greater insight???"
Is cclp going to be around in two years?
"Another evening of studying USAC and CCLP. I saw the reports today on both these companies where the debt is essentially rated as junk. I had a credit analyst look at the debt a few months ago. Management has some very important decisions to make regarding the future of this business. On the one hand Investors are looking for yield while on the other hand some investors have a different outlook and time horizon. I think the choices Management are faced with are investment in the long term viability of the business versus creating shareholder value. The decision to crater the market capitalization of the company through distribution cut demonstrates the long term view of Management. At sub $3 per share my belief is that the best use of the companies excess cash is not to pay a dividend but to continue to pay down debt and repurchase units to undue the very costly impact of dilution. Assuming Management could spend 30m dramatically reducing outstanding units you could see DCF go as high as 1.70 per unit like it was back in the not too distant past. The problem is they stay have a business to run and must meet customer demand. We know the cycle is projected to be good for the next 4 years but the tension occurs in 2022 when the fat lady sings and debt becomes due. I think the company could potentially be far better off reducing share count than expanding horsepower. The investment in horsepower and long term risks of doing so may not be better and safer than buying units at a deeply discounted price. I have never seen a clearer situation where the price of the security/unit is simply going to be what Management says it is. If Management decides in the short run it wants a higher unit price it then causes a 13.5 percent USAC type yield. If Management wants to financially engineer it's book value and increase future distribution per unit it buys back units. If Management wants to skirt making an all or none decision it increases it's pricing substantially on new build quotes, delivers to 4.5 Ebitda and pays a below market distribution. We shall see where this all ends up."
USAC Earnings looked good.....
"They told us that they needed to take care of the preferred and needed a year with .o1 dividend quarterly. A year has gone by without an increase in dividend, whats their problem? What a game ? What is going on.?"
"we need some creative restructuring of CCLP and TTI. Merging the companies with a reverse split? Something, because they are being dictated to by sellers. Paying a 30% dividend is not realistic."
CCLP has been climbing fairly consistently over the past 6mos -- particularly the past month -- tons of projects going on and CCLP is getting their share - IMO we are FINALLY going to see our payday this year
this should be very good for CCLP as they should get the compression piecehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/cheniere-apos-midship-pipeline-gets-130801980.html
I have doubled my position on this. Continue to like what I see from USAC and believe this can follow suit. USAC reports earnings on 5/7 which will give us a glimpse of what the first quarter compression market looks like before CCLP reports the following day. Oil looks like it will hover in the $65 to $70 range for a long time.
Looks like the beginning of good things to come for us longs
Here we are again down in the gutters. While TSLA zooms past $500...definitely the wrong stock to own. It will be interesting to see what happens this year. They are generating significant free cash flow and yet trade as if they were on the brink of bankruptcy...this is the market we live in.
Anyone old enough to remember Mr. T and his famous line I pity the poor fool. Why would you sell in the day AROC has a stellar conference call and CCLP is about to announce a 70 percent increase in Ebitda quarter over quarter and perhaps an 800 percent increase in distribution. Last quarter Emilio said he couldn't commit but the company was thinking 50 percent to growth capital and 50 percent to stakeholders defined as unit holders and debt. The series A ironically will be extinguished on the day of the conference call. Call me the eternal optimist but I believe we will get some respect when the yield returns to an industry norm. Driving home today I was trying to quantify all things being equal why cclp would trade at 1.3 Ebitda versus 8 plus. Besides the poor yield it is because UBTI or unrelated business taxable income which retirement plans would be subject to. I think we get dinged slightly being a PTP as opposed to a c Corp but the C Corp loses out on the 199A pass through deduction. I sure like excluding 20 percent when the time comes. Per the AROC call lead times are shrinking on new builds to about 33 weeks and they are cutting growth capital by 50 percent for 2020. If we cut growth capital by 50 percent next year the distribution will soar.
This stock is going to $3 by July. Loading up on this. Oil is getting a strong boost and demand is picking up.
finally
AROC debt offering oversubscribed. They were able to add 100m onto the 400M offering @6.25 percent. Bodes well for us possibly saving 3.25m per year if we float at the same rate.
"It's interesting to watch the volume fall day after day. Often I buy 10 percent of the volume each day but as Dirty Harry once said "" A man must know his limitations""."
big move - big volume -- interesting?? some big pipeline projects in the mill - maybe that is what is providing the boost
this is being bought?
"Own 14,300 remaining shares (have sold several thousand at a loss) with now average cost of $5.32 per share so not a happy camper. Just finished listening to the CC and the company's results are stronger and improving and I suppose for the long term the company is taking a conservative approach to improve its balance sheet and financial strength which is supposed to translate into improved shareholder value/price which is their spoken aim. However, the market is not particularly reacting this way with the stock down today after all this good business news. I think shareholder value, i.e. the stock price is also quite tied to what they will distribute in dividends to shareholders and NOT ONE mention of this in the CC. I come away with suggestion/opinion that the distribution will remain at a token 1 cent per Q and it seems like, despite complete retirement of the pfd stock, the company is going to continue to delever (retire debt) and most of the cash flow will go towards this and some to capex and that any meaningful increase is unlikely until well into 2021 or even 2022 the way they seem to be talking. So good luck with much increase in the shareholder price despite delevering and good business outlook. I wish it would translate into a better stock price, but doesn't look like it. I think they should and could have been a little more generous now with a dividend."
tomorrow will be interesting here and CHK - a similar stuck in the mud situation - Im expecting both to beat estimates
"Wow, garbage now."
"Any thoughts on when the next dividend announcement, and yield?"
Something is starting to smell.
Nice buying volume at the eod today - that don't look so bad...
Slowly walking the dog down. The volume doesn't indicate panic selling or large institutional position selling. This is either the buy of the century or a giant trap on undisclosed bad news from the company.
anyone seeing a reverse split coming?
Why are all the executives quitting?! see the 8k filed today
0.01 dividend. It is a shame that it will probably continue its sideways trajectory for a while yet as everybody seems to be looking for yield these days. At least the fundamentals are strong and they will be able to pay off a greater chunk of debt/commitments more quickly. I am anticipating a div after the next quarter.
I forecasted 35m of Ebitda and see the 32.8 fell short because of a 2.3m impairment. The market continues to misprice this asset. A great quarter gotta love north of 15m cash flow. I was hoping to hit 4.50 today on a distribution announcement. I think we go north of $4.00 today judging by yesterday and the guidance.
Up Up and Away she goes. Crossed the first psychological milestone of $3.50. Now let’s try for $3.75 before the next earnings call.
"Great returns and even greater prospects with LNG being sold globally. As demand for pipelines intensifies, so will the demand for compressors"
"Thanks Gary for all your analysis. Slightly depressing to see USAC hitting new highs almost daily and CCLP stuck at a very low valuation. Depending on the corporate actions they take, the unit price could easily double within the year. Definitely holding tight. Tempted to accumulate more but will wait for fresh news from the firm...even if it means paying a higher price."
Oil and Gas Journal reports historic new energy breakthrough about to impact Energy and Healthcare. Medical radioisotopes first and major energy source for the electric power grid next. Looks like first and earliest buyers will reap biggest rewards.https://www.oilandgas360.com/long-awaited-fusion-energy-breakthrough-finally-arrives/
Potential reverse split. if stock not trading over an average of $3 on or after March 1st then they could do a reverse split so that the preferred redemption works. Right now the current shareholders are being diluted at such a rate its an embarrassment.
CCLP doing great after-hours. This uptrend should continue for the future days or weeks.
huge volume too -- maybe something slipped ahead of the cc?
Is not tti the general partner of cclp. TTI is up 60 per cent for the week
today felt like the last time it climbed right up to $7 before taking a break
