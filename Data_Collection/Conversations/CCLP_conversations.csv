AROC debt offering oversubscribed. They were able to add 100m onto the 400M offering @6.25 percent. Bodes well for us possibly saving 3.25m per year if we float at the same rate.
"Warren Buffet likes buying Natural Gas storage and transmission at a 10B valuation. Why is he the greatest value Investor of all time? Because he only buys companies when the intrinsic value of the underlying assets is greater than what he pays for the stock. What is the intrinsic value of cclp's assets? I would think the approximate 15m cash in the bank, the manufacturing facility maybe 8m, the discounted value of the compressors at 900m less the debt of approximately 650m leaves 273m equity for shareholders. 273m/47m units is 5.80 per share. I own many hundreds of thousands of units of cclp. When I see Management either declare a buyback or start buying 50,000 units minimum I will consider doubling my stake. Theoretically, the company could liquidate and I would make over 600 percent. Patience will be rewarded. Warren Buffet knows natural gas is not going away soon. There will be a large run-up which started today as the earnings have to be way higher than last quarter for two reasons, the debt write off and the additional 30m in equipment sale this quarter"
"Jerome no doubt about it that the communication has been once the preferred was paid the distribution would resume. In the short run very disappointing to those who are after yield (virtually everyone who invests in a mlp). If you go back 5 years you can see the fundamentals have never been better. The only problem is the share count has risen. GP owns way more units than we do. I would argue along with you that they have our best interest at stake. I own more than a couple hundred thousand units and buy more most days. So if I can continue to acquire a company earning 60 percent next year on my entry price why do I want them to triple the price instead if buying back units on the cheap. Clearly it's better for them to spend 30m in buy backs instead of distributions. They understand this now, maybe before they were sensitive to the huge drop in unit price but once the yield went away and short term holders they realized what is best for the holders is to get the outstanding units down. My projection shows 1.50 dcf within 24 months if they hold off on distribution and just buy back. I will retire on this investment."
Doubling the distribution would send a very positive message.
"another observation based on some of my other investments- Cheniere is currently the Midship Pipeline [48"" pipe] down through OK -- ENBL has 4 connections to that pipe + several other pipeline outfits - all of this requires large compression units - that are currently being installed - Im just guessing some of that is CCLP --- looking forward to the upcoming QtrlyCC"
So Ended in green territory. Manipulation to draw more in or all the downside risk now factored in? We know that Q1 is good due to their order book and new pipelines that are being built to debottleneck permian
It’s official. The only thing that moves this above $4... is an increase in the distribution
Should be distribution announcement coming soon. My guess is this week. Hope they do it right.
I will be holding [and adding to] this one while watching them rebuild -- they took a beating in '17 and appear to be recovering at a pretty rapid pace - all metrics are improving and I expect the SP will also improve as they complete repurchase of the preferred units and follow on this fall with their go-forward dividend - I live in OK and see LOTS of drilling and pipeline activity supporting some of the sales and backlog they talked about in the cc
"Wait a minute! Per Stifel March 1, 2019. ""Furthermore, CCLP remains committed to reducing leverage to 4.5x or better. We currently estimate over 6.0x leverage (sub 5.5x annualizing 4q18), but estimate a decline to 5.2x by YE 19 (4.8x annualizing 4q10) and to management's target of 4.5x by 2020."" Now per the 10Q Series A Preferred UnitsBecause the Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, the fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 480 ""Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity."" The fair value of the Preferred Units as of December 31, 2018 was $30.9 million. Changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To calculate the estimated fair value of our Preferred Units, we utilize market information related to debt instruments, the trading price of our common units, and lattice modeling techniques. Because the Preferred Units are convertible into our common units at the option of the holder, the fair value of the Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price of our common units, and this increase/decrease in Preferred Unit fair value will be charged/credited to earnings. Because of the volatility of market factors inherent in the estimation of the fair value of the Preferred Units, including the trading price of our common units, the volatility of our earnings may increase while the Preferred Units are outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Preferred Units decreased to $30.9 million, resulting in $0.8 million credited to earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.If our debt is 645,940 and we are paying off 4.1m per month of debt on the 8th of each month using Managements upper guidance of 140m EBITDA 4.5x140M=630M of debt we can deleverage to 4.5x by Christmas and still receive dividends next year."
CCLP is up 5.63% to 6.38
"Did a deep dive into insider sentiment for the volumes of natural gas going forward. Everyone was bullish so I bought a substantial amount of CSIs trading volume last week. The company will release record earnings and DCF yet the price is near a record low. They paid 10x EBITDA for Compressor Systems or 825m to become what they are today. This was $961/h.p. Today we trade at $681 per horsepower. The company trades at a fraction of EBITDA, and the USAC and AROC comps on our service business alone would value us at between 537.5 -337.5M. How does a company cash flowing between 55m and 59m have a 95m market value in an industry that quite frankly is robust? It's really quite simple the leverage is high and there is no yield. If you listen to USAC's conference call and listen to AROC's conference call you know exactly what CSI will say on Wednesday. I like knowing what a company will announce before they announce it.1. Customers are being very disciplined with capital allocation. 2. Growth Capex is being cut in 2020 by CSI. 3. We remain positive in future volumes of natural gas. 4. Price increases will be moderate for 2020. 5. Leverage expected to be 4.69 by year end. Only unknown is whether any discussion of capital allocation strategy specifics. Meanwhile I gobble this up at 65 percent return on capital ( next year's DCF/today's market cap)."
You have to figure that today was firmly in the blackout period for insiders so today’s action has to come from outside with perhaps some better knowledge of the latest on compression. Given today’s action I can predict this going to $3.90 and above $4 if any news on when they will raise dividends
"60m projected and publicly announced cash flow or after tax cash flow keeps the company and Investors very happy. Negative income is an accounting concept defined as expenses in excess of revenue. This company's major expense is depreciation which is an accounting concept not cash flow concept. President Trump has negative taxable income and pays no income tax as a result of depreciation. It's not income that pays for goods and services, it's cash flow and cclp has close to 60m of it."
Something is starting to smell.
"Own 14,300 remaining shares (have sold several thousand at a loss) with now average cost of $5.32 per share so not a happy camper. Just finished listening to the CC and the company's results are stronger and improving and I suppose for the long term the company is taking a conservative approach to improve its balance sheet and financial strength which is supposed to translate into improved shareholder value/price which is their spoken aim. However, the market is not particularly reacting this way with the stock down today after all this good business news. I think shareholder value, i.e. the stock price is also quite tied to what they will distribute in dividends to shareholders and NOT ONE mention of this in the CC. I come away with suggestion/opinion that the distribution will remain at a token 1 cent per Q and it seems like, despite complete retirement of the pfd stock, the company is going to continue to delever (retire debt) and most of the cash flow will go towards this and some to capex and that any meaningful increase is unlikely until well into 2021 or even 2022 the way they seem to be talking. So good luck with much increase in the shareholder price despite delevering and good business outlook. I wish it would translate into a better stock price, but doesn't look like it. I think they should and could have been a little more generous now with a dividend."
"They told us that they needed to take care of the preferred and needed a year with .o1 dividend quarterly. A year has gone by without an increase in dividend, whats their problem? What a game ? What is going on.?"
the recent debt conversion should be very good news - they will be able to issue new debt at a better rate for longer out + still looking forward to the sale of their mfg facility which should do wonders for their financial position
I have doubled my position on this. Continue to like what I see from USAC and believe this can follow suit. USAC reports earnings on 5/7 which will give us a glimpse of what the first quarter compression market looks like before CCLP reports the following day. Oil looks like it will hover in the $65 to $70 range for a long time.
Interesting how the 2.5 July/October have almost no premium associated with them. I guess they are now deep in the money...almost tempted to punt on the $5 Oct calls...still trading at a very low premium...I think we could see $5ish by the end of the summer once the preferred are out...thoughts?
Up Up and Away she goes. Crossed the first psychological milestone of $3.50. Now let’s try for $3.75 before the next earnings call.
"The concept of Negative income is called ""loosing money"" every year, if you spend more money than your revenues guess what is going to happened?. How did they get the 60m.? Maybe TTI is contributing to the 60m. Less revenue , less cash , less dividends, less everything. You have to thanks TTI.Relate to President Trump, I think he did not check his income before to get into bankruptcy for how many times?. Negative Income is a sign that your are loosing money, not good for the business.Are you working for this company? Because, how do you know that the company and Investor are happy?"
"Just in from AROC earnings transcript CEONow, let me update our take on the market. The market for US contract compression remains extremely strong, backed by a high-level of customer demand, long lead times for new equipment and strong utilization of compression equipment overall. Conversation with customers regarding their future compression needs together with market forecasts for natural gas production increases give me confidence that there continues to be increasing long-term demand for our services across geographies. This would include in the Permian, the Eagle Ford and Niobrara, Marcellus, and Utica Shale place.Our book of business is robust with strategic customers planning well in advance for their compression needs and placing orders up to a year in advance and at attractive pricing levels. As I've said for several quarters in a row, our customer commitments for contract compression horsepower to be placed into service in 2019, and even extending into 2020 remained at elevated levels. Indeed, nearly 95% of the new horsepower of which we will take delivery in 2019 has already been committed and contracted with our customers.In addition to positive indications from our customers and near-term market forecasts, the long-term macro backdrop continues to support the profitable expansion of our business. US natural gas production is forecasted to increase over 7 Bcf a day or about 9% in 2019. Our production increased for the US for the second -- only to the record natural gas production increase we experienced in 2018. Rising US natural gas production and demand for compression is a result of the sustained structural increase in the global demand for and an expanding use of natural gas. It is not merely driven by commodity price cycles."
Report and guidance look great and its full steam ahead...cclp will evaluate Divi in 2nd half 2019 and hopefully we will be rewarded for our wait..
"Interesting: Poor quarter due to timing issues it seems. Management reaffirms full year outlook and forecast. If that forecast does hold, the 2nd half of the year could be really strong. Almost done with the preferred. After that, focus on meeting increased demand through increased growth capex, aiming at 4.5x leverage and reinitiating payout at a higher level...all in all, we are still in a waiting pattern but for those who are patient, a $3 unit seems really low one year out from here given underlying strength in compressor market."
The price ran 43 percent in a few weeks and nobody posted...odd
Note - FTSI [well fracking/completion company] did fairly well on their recent rpt and jumped from .50 to 1.40 in last two daysCCLP is in much more solid shape with WAY better backlog and revenue stream -
"On Thursday an article published on Seeking Alpha under CCLP's major competitor, AROC makes a STRONG case for the entire gas compression space. Extremely bullish article (I meen - EXTREMELY BULLISH). Please read, then reply to this question; Given the mergers and acquisitions of the NOW top 2 companies, how likely do you think that the NOW #3 (CCLP) COULD see merger (i.e. TTI merging with the remaining 19 million shares of CCLP) OR an acquisition by ?? (undetermined Company, or group of Companies)?"
Here we are again down in the gutters. While TSLA zooms past $500...definitely the wrong stock to own. It will be interesting to see what happens this year. They are generating significant free cash flow and yet trade as if they were on the brink of bankruptcy...this is the market we live in.
Sweeping management changes going on at CSI. Most of the new officers are coming from Spartan Energy. Anyone know what all this means. Bonds say the financial structure is substantially improved.
"Just bought more. Go to SA to find very thoughtful recent articles and discussions on this one. Not worth repeating it here. This one is a steal by any metric. Management is soaking up the preferred. No more crazy dilution. Underlying business is very strong. Multibagger potential here. Distribution will resume after Q3 once all preferred are out of the way. They will have enough for distribution and growth. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
Well..your dream cash flow got to 16..close but no cigar but you got that large International order!...They posted a great quarter and will continue next as well..they at 1st mentioned that over 50% of their extra cash would go to Stakeholders but no mention of Divi increase out of that..waiting for CC...they want to be in a strong position in 2020 to refinance some Debt...
This stock looks really interesting. I’ve had good success with USAC and I’m now buying into CCLP at $3. I think this will go to $4 by Sept and I suspect they will pay an 8% dividend at that share price so locking in now might be the best investment I make the rest of the year. Go LONGS!
"Another day studying the industry in particular AROC. AROC in their last conference call said they are turning away business because of the amount of capital required to service new build demand. AROC discloses like CCLP the amount of new horsepower coming online and the cost of the horsepower. I researched comparable acquisitions of company horsepower and the range is $900 to 1,250 depending on where in the cycle the purchase took place. So I see Moody's rates everyone's debt as B1 essentially junk and think to myself. CCLP is worth north of $7 if the company liquidates and sells all its equipment at $900 per horsepower and pays off its creditors. From my experience dealing with Lenders CCLP's debt is not junk but gold. There is zero risk that the lender is under collateralized"
"Anyone out there? I bought another 10,000 shares after learning about the Elite sale at $953 per hp. That transaction values us at over 1.1B less debt. Elite sells off it's low hp before the deal and the next week cclp files an 8k notifying it's low compressor guy gets a payout if there is a change in control. Can the tea leaves I am reading be any more obvious? Is the investing public so lazy that they can't put 2 and 2 together. Comments please!"
"Not many shares available today, not selling mine till it goes back to at least $12"
How does a company recover from a negative income for many years without going to bankruptcy and executives buying shares when the company is not in the best economical shape?
Great Earnings
"I expect years of capital expenditure to secure more ""energy independence"" from the US. This should benefit CCLP greatly. This stock is probably one of the cheapest out there. They are done with their preferred stock. Things could get interesting now with debt repurchases, unit repurchases and higher payouts. If it were a C corp, this thing would fly. It is in this no man's land of MLP without decent payout. It could certainly change with payout resuming at higher levels as of year end but I would rather they do unit repurchases first and soak up as many units as possible and only then increase payout..."
"I would like to modify my original thoughts on the company as I have now received more information and invested more time in studying the history of the company. The new information I have studied is various analyst reports by both Wells and Stifel. Management of Publicly Traded companies have a tension between low trading prices and running the business. So what we have here is a business that is doing very well from a business perspective and very poorly from a unit price perspective. The question is how do you try and reconcile the current situation, a company booming in exercising on its business plan with a sub optimal market valuation. I previously thought the company would have large phantom income and would have to start paying a large dividend next year. I no longer hold this opinion. Reports are that 80% of the company's income is tax sheltered. Company's stated objective is bring leverage down from over 6x to 4.5x. This is not going to happen from paying a market rate dividend. It will be achieved from investing cash flow into the business while simultaneously paying down debt. The valuation in this industry is all over the board. You can see 6x to 10x Ebitda. Within a few months the Analysts covering the company modify their projections from 8.5x to a lower multiple. So investors have to decide whether to invest in growth or income. This space is usually where investors seeking income play. Now no real income and a large shift in the business plan to reduce leverage. It seems the GP had to make the investment in capex so as to not disappoint a major customer. Seems like a reasonable course of action. The company's amended credit facility is driving the future of the business along with Management's desire to avert a crazy dilutive capital raise like the last one. I think Investors are going to be patient here and let Management execute on their business plan and reduce the outstanding debt. The stock should increase in value after each quarter as Mangement reduces the book loss and increases cash flow from growth and pricing increases."
