It appears Cirrus is on sale today. I have opened a position (~$87/share). The price seems like a reasonable entry point after earnings.
"Potential investor - concerned about most of revenue from one client, Apple. Thoughts?"
"Great results, they always play the future numbers for the next quarter less than what they really are . I believe they will do more than 350 million in the up coming quarter so they will beat their own predictions so why sell now ."
"Forty-year-old company, $4 billion market cap, a growing demand for semiconductors, and one missed forecast ER. There's your DD. You're welcome."
"So, is this how market works? Company beating earning estimates, and with good future guidance gets hammered by investor and its price gets wiped out? Does it make sense? ABC of investment says that good news should bring the share price up and not down, Cirrus is going down from the day the announced stellar earnings."
Bought 150 at 39.7 ....let’s go!!!!
I have a feeling it’s already priced in 10% usually Before earnings it goes downI have a feeling that YouTube guy is pumping the stock and people Paying a premiumLet’s see Hopefully he’s right
Apple will be announcing that they will use their own amplifiers. If you are an electrical engineer (like me) you know how designing analog is easy even for small companies why pay a premium while you can make your own? Imagine they decided to make their own CPUs and you know the process defining instructions are not the easiest thing but looks like they are efficient enough that they decided to replace intel. I don't think Intel will lose much but CRUS revenue will drop drastically over years unless they make something new and exciting.
I bet they will have chips that go into the new apple home pods. Chips demands will only get higher.
Why does nobody care about this stock? They said they have a new product coming out with a key customer in the back half of this year. New product in apple phones? My 95 strikes for 22' are gonna print
Good news
2021-02-02 10:09:00 GMT DJ Cirrus Logic Price Target Raised to $110.00/Share From $100.00 by KeyBanc
"The same story been said for over 20 years , until Apple moves to make their own audio chips, CRUS will stay the main supplier to all Apple products which means more money for crus, the stock is undervalued in my opinion and it’s at bargain prices."
"It doesn’t make sense, always down on good news, Apple crushed earnings and future sales strong means CRUS will crush earnings so why selling now."
Way oversold. Upgraded today. Will have big role in Apple Airpod over near future and going forward. Great buying opportunity here!
small float....thinkin 112-115 after earnings AND guidance
"Why do they list Earning (TTM) as $2.77 when the actual earnings for the quaters are; 0.85, 0.81, 1.36, aand 1.59. That adds up to $4.41."
"Half in at $71.78. Will be back in a month or two to see where we are at. Solid company, unjustified drop. GLTA"
"With apple's phone road map looking much healthier, maybe we'll get some trickle down here."
Zacks equity research firm had analysts predicting a miss on earnings. Well isn’t something of all the times they blow it. My thoughts they are looking out for only themselves to benefit in turning the tables and investing the other way. It sure seems that way when I look at the stock movement of this high of percentage.
