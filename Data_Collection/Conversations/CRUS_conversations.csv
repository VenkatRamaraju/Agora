"Based on the chart analysis, CRUS will be $50 in a month, wait to load up."
Whoever sold under $80.00 will feel sorry and regretted fully by tomorrow once it 's moving to higher high as soon as this week...
can't believe it. that was insane. I literally just caused out on my shares yesterday and here we are down 7% today. what luck! I'm buying back in tomorrow
Why does nobody care about this stock? They said they have a new product coming out with a key customer in the back half of this year. New product in apple phones? My 95 strikes for 22' are gonna print
CNBC just mentioned that FB was interested in buying CRUS
And down again with no reason why
Just bought in as a long term hold. Anything below $40 is a good bargain in my opinion considering all the growth vectors for the long term. Let's make some $$$$!
Massive beat on top and bottom numbers on ER. Soft range guidance for next quarter with midpoint slightly lower than the consensus. CRUS sets up to beat next earnings.
Just loaded up 
Boom! Great earnings.....
Opened position today. I believe there is going to be an iPhone super cycle and they could expand customer base. GL to all longs.
"QCOM and QRVO getting beaten down after hours today, tech sell off in the Thursday morning , low 80's buy in opp for CRUS tomorrow."
"CRUS last Wed E/R with VERY GOOD RESULTS and UPSIDE OUTLOOK /GUIDANCEplus GOOG and GOOGL will report their earning results after market closes on comming MONDAY 02/03/20 , so will drive whole NASDAQ once again up very high, and so does CRUS......Load / Buy more shares in today DIP in after hours for great profit on MONDAY , .....BUY,,,,,,"
ok climbing up and slowly
HUGE earnings beat. Hang on!
This is why it's falling - Co now sees Q1 revs of $210-$250 mln vs. $301.10 mln Capital IQ Consensus Estimate. As low as $210 vs previous of $301 ?
No reason this should fall this hard it has a much smaller valuation and yet gets punished more than other high growth stocks
Too cheap
Oversold!in @ $60.85!
apple beat like crazy in sales... a preview on crus earnings
"It doesn’t make sense, always down on good news, Apple crushed earnings and future sales strong means CRUS will crush earnings so why selling now."
Great growth stock for 2018 and beyond.
"its good, we are now upward, the cleansing has been done---"
I've been holding since $55. Sure it hurts but I see brighter days ahead. Holding
Ohhhhhhhhh yeah
"The financials are so strong...just risky having Apple as your main customer (by far), and now Apple is making a lot of its chips..."
Holy smokas
Yahoo has consensus estimates at .28. What's your guess where we come in next week?
5% up amazing
"So what is wrong with CRUS?!! NASDAQ is up 1.97% today, AAPL is up 1.71% and this POC is only up 0.50% after dropping drastically (dropped over 30% within the last six months)!!"
"Ouch, down $5 after hours. Below 40 tomorrow. Next support is 36, if it drops below 36, watch out below (20's)IMHO"
Longs are getting rewarded in the afterhours for enduring the manipulation on crus over the last month.....big earnings beat!!
One of the few green today
Another upgrade at Barclays underweight to equal weight pt 65
"The same story been said for over 20 years , until Apple moves to make their own audio chips, CRUS will stay the main supplier to all Apple products which means more money for crus, the stock is undervalued in my opinion and it’s at bargain prices."
Why is this dropping so much right now
Guess we'll see the mid 60's before this chip selling stops.
Missed EPS and Revenue?
I will not be surprised if I see $60.00 or lower in next 2-3 months . If Apple do not make new gadgets this years then price of the stock will go down to $50.00
"A friend advised me of CIRRUS on Thursday to buy in, glad I took his advice. This has a potential of a 30%-40% increase in the short term. Wait and see."
"Potential investor - concerned about most of revenue from one client, Apple. Thoughts?"
Glad I didn’t sell this stock last week!
"Hello everyone, I used to own this and did well on it, when I saw the huge drop, I had to buy in again. Good luck to all the longs, at this level, this is a steal"
Will pass 100 this year
I think a lot of these companies set expectations for the year based on seasonal shipments. Apple isn’t resetting guidance in fact is bragging that xr is best selling iPhone ever.
crus is the rodney dangerfield of chip stocks...
Selling CRUS like throwing money away
"Aug 2, 2017 this was $63 p/s. Where’s the bottom?"
why cirrus is falling so hard? Tech sector is rallying. What will happen if tech correction happens.
Read the report.....revenues for next quarter are 40% lower than this quarter.

Not a pro at reading financial statements. But how would u rate this company. I think everything looks good except for the fact that total liabilities is much greater than total assets
nice rebounce
Contract with AAPL airpods reason CRUS is higher.
"Great results, they always play the future numbers for the next quarter less than what they really are . I believe they will do more than 350 million in the up coming quarter so they will beat their own predictions so why sell now ."
Way oversold. Upgraded today. Will have big role in Apple Airpod over near future and going forward. Great buying opportunity here!
"Good results , could have been better but I think they being cautious with their future earnings, every quarter they beat their numbers so today’s selling is waste of money"
going to 55
Sold at 42.50 . Didnt want to wait till earnings.
Time to buy
Earnings were good!
Apple will be announcing that they will use their own amplifiers. If you are an electrical engineer (like me) you know how designing analog is easy even for small companies why pay a premium while you can make your own? Imagine they decided to make their own CPUs and you know the process defining instructions are not the easiest thing but looks like they are efficient enough that they decided to replace intel. I don't think Intel will lose much but CRUS revenue will drop drastically over years unless they make something new and exciting.
Cirrus Logic is up 5.17% to 77.75
"Free Technical Advice: CRUS is heading to 50-52 range, if you look at my previous comments here at the board you will see that I was precisely predicting this at 75 level a day before the Q2 report. That was a trap and a fake run up. Chart looks exactly like Oct. 2016 technical, and follows the same pattern. It will test 50 (the march lows) and then will go up to 75."
"Why do they list Earning (TTM) as $2.77 when the actual earnings for the quaters are; 0.85, 0.81, 1.36, aand 1.59. That adds up to $4.41."
2021-02-02 10:09:00 GMT DJ Cirrus Logic Price Target Raised to $110.00/Share From $100.00 by KeyBanc
where are the smarts claiming that the stock is worth 20 because apple will cease the collaboration?

CRUS reached a new 52 Week Low at 48.08
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
Yes!
"Lumentum (LITE) shares are halted this morning after slashing their outlook because of a drastic reduction in shipments to their main customer, Apple. LITE is a facial recognition supplier to AAPL. This is not good news for CRUS at all."
Cirrus Logic is up 4.91% to 90.60
tons of cash no debt and APPL is selling over 220 ml phones.....Cirrus was at 70 one year ago when aapl phones were at the 220 ml threshold for sales AND thats where we are at today....figure that and you will see the value here.....booyah Cirrus is now green!!

Yesterday amd was pressed down after stellar earnings but then came back with astonishing strength. Will the same happen for crus?
Its on sale
CRUS reached an all time high at 85.96
Analyist continue to lie regarding Apple suppliers.....just as bad as the hedgefunds that took this market down in 2008 while repeating themselves in 2018......what a pity and the time to open your eyes and look at the cheap valuation on this darlin of a company.....crus has been around for 30 years and apple is a close friend to crus for 10....armagadeon has been priced into the stock itself... better days coming when the markets settle down!!
Such great performance and prospects
CRUS is the best semi stock; Target $90 in 6 months or so with upside more than 25%
"This announcement should have been released a month ago, beginning of November when many of apple suppliers came out and slashed their guidance, actually crus took a bigger hit then from around $45 down almost $9 per share, my calculations tell me this announcement is already been factored in and the stock is undervalued at this level( $44 )."
airpods max will make this move. continuous use of crus products
"This looks good, low pe and beta"
Bought 150 at 39.7 ....let’s go!!!!
"Geez, that was a quick profit. Thanks. Bought at 50.95, sold at 52.50."
Love the acquisition- could be a case of 2+2=8
Who is here from jermeys vid
"This is ripe for a takeover, at these prices it would be a bargain, debt free and cash rich!"
Why is this up 0.9% when Nasdaq is down 1.98%?
2018 will be flat...2019 doe......look out
"With apple's phone road map looking much healthier, maybe we'll get some trickle down here."
"I going to buy, inflation going up & stock market going up. You money will be worth half in the next ten years."
"I've owned CY,IDTI and CRUS. CY and IDTI were both acquired in recent years. If CRUS is acquired the circle would be complete."

I bet they will have chips that go into the new apple home pods. Chips demands will only get higher.

We back ;)
this puppy about to get some wings
It appears Cirrus is on sale today. I have opened a position (~$87/share). The price seems like a reasonable entry point after earnings.
"Still no volume other than institutions buying on earnings release then selling into strength as it hit that $60. Price. CRUS did retreat back to that 39 level for an entry point after April. But again no volume here equals no conviction. Retail buyers keep pushing it up. But hey good for them with price. PE getting up there again too, pretty rich so growth better be there in next earnings release and guidance. Just saying be careful."
shorts had 3.5 days to cover
So why is this finally moving upwards? What’s the reason just on the back of Apple news? Realistically where will it head in the near future? I wanna bail out of this. Thanks
unfortunately I don't have more money to put in...
Highest close in 5 months. I hope this uptrend continues. They beat earnings by a mile and hit 45 after hours before crashing to 39 the next day. I hope to get 50 by the end of the month. Who knows.
I am buying 1000 @ $ 71!!! All in.
Will have to buy today to celebrate Zack's bear of the day call.Doing well on their Strong Sell rating for MU.
Perfect example of a fall for no reason at all. Go long on CRUS. They will play a big role in AI in the future.
Should start moving higher to catch up with the market.
"Careful ,into earnings. Some negative quantitative analysis is present. One positive is free cash flow but true earnings less than reported when footnotes factored in, return on capital less than cost of capital, price to Economic book value 2.5+,"
"If I was you guys I'd use this as an opportunity to buy more, however the only major risk with the stock is its dependence on Apple, if you dont like that than probably is best to stay away. But with a forward p/e of 9 now, im buying."
Once again Zacks bear of the day pays off
Cirrus starts its run into earnings this week
The $260M in buybacks could account for 10% of the float if the CFO can get an average price under $40.This will be very sweet for those in CRUS for the long term.
Like CRUS and FEYE for a double
"From another message board I follow which makes perfect sense:Here's what I think: First I've been following the opticals for a while (and have taken the lumps). Lumentum supplies lasers (VCSELs) for the iPhone. Last year Apple did fairly big deal with Lumentum competitor Finisar to supplier lasers (VCSELS) which helped Finisar build a new 6"" fab in Sherman TX. The fab was supposed to start supplying product in November with production dedicated to VCSELs for Apple. So I think Finisar is now supplying product and Apple cut orders from Lumentum in response. To confirm that, last week IIVI (two/six) signed a deal to purchase Finisar. Most have been skeptical of Finisar's ability to execute given this was a 6"" fab, but it is very likely given recent events that they are executing and supplying VCSELs.I'm NOT absolutely positive, but it's very possible that Apple's cutting of Lumentum orders are specific to VCSELs. Not sure if Apple is cutting complete BOM orders, if they are probably not to the extent they cut Lumentum order."
Why are people saying this year will be flat but 2019 will be a good year?
LOL JEREMY NOOOOOO
It looks as if the CFO is defending the share price.
"So, is this how market works? Company beating earning estimates, and with good future guidance gets hammered by investor and its price gets wiped out? Does it make sense? ABC of investment says that good news should bring the share price up and not down, Cirrus is going down from the day the announced stellar earnings."
CRUS has a track record for delivering and they always do right?? with that said i am not paying attention to all the channel checks and calls being made by analyist who do have an agenda....ASP can hit revenues but contract revenues are consistent with growth for crus.....patience on this one ~~ thats where i am at!!
"CRUS chips are in high demand, I believe we going to see 110 very soon"
news on apple making high end ear buds may be driving crus today
Satnam is about to get a margin call soon lads ahahahaha
Nice turnaround Crus
it makes money and its cheap
"Forty-year-old company, $4 billion market cap, a growing demand for semiconductors, and one missed forecast ER. There's your DD. You're welcome."
This stock is going back to 40$ !!! Apple making own audio chip
this is my biggest loser since last summer
"Chris we are all still using the old Yahoo format page. In my situation, the new graphics based internet pages lock up more times than they work. Grade Zero"
small float....thinkin 112-115 after earnings AND guidance
"Half in at $71.78. Will be back in a month or two to see where we are at. Solid company, unjustified drop. GLTA"
Wow huge rally and this thing still down..
"I think Apple is not ending its relationship with CRUS but actually planning to take over CRUS when time is right, possibly in Q3 2018."
https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/18/3-ways-cirrus-logic-reduce-reliance-on-apple.aspx
All APPLE suppliers in RED now ! Never rely on Apple !
Idk what more people want. Apple reported great earnings and so did CRUS. I guess this stock just doesn't draw enough interest in general...
Would another company want to buy Cirrus? If not for their technology maybe for their location paying less taxes. Has there been any buyout tries or talks in the past? Just asking.
Going to 30$
Any chance CRUS will pull off a SWKS reaction when they report? Tempted to add ahead of ER.
I hope the CFO kept some powder dry in the buyback... This is a great time for the share repurchase.
the way it's making it's come back could continue
"Does anyone believe this is anything but the company buying?? The numbers were bad, the projected revs for next quarter are abysmal, and the Nasdaq is down 66 pts. 4 Analysts responded this morning with all of them dropping their target prices on CRUS by $3 to $9 per share. Barclays target is now $32 !!Last night the Company said during the conference they'd buy shares to keep the market but they'll have to buy every day because buyers are not rushing in this quarter to buy a stock that missed on EPS and now reduces it's next earnings report revenues by as much as $91 Million."
"Q1 FY21 revenue was $242.6 million and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.30 and $0.53, respectively.Q1 FY21 sales reflect strong demand for certain products shipping in tablets and smartphones.Despite the continuing challenges and adverse economic effects associated with COVID-19, design activity and new product development efforts were encouraging during the quarter."
"Despite the recent price rise this is still a bargain IMHO. With recent great results, a very positive outlook and a P/E ratio of only 26 the future has to be bright.I believe this will be like Dialog (closest competitor) who Apple initially took a bite of about 25% of the company a couple of years ago. More recently they are in the process of being acquired by Renesas. I think the future is a lot rosier at Cirrus as their audio solutions are marketing leading and that alone makes them a nice target for a bigger semiconductor company to complement their existing product portfolio.That all said, I think Apple will seriously eye them up as an acquisition target, if nothing else to protect their position."
"Been doing some research on.this company and very.impressed!!! Market cap is less than $5B so has plenty of room to run. Apple is flying n that will only propel this organization. They're also diversifying their revenues and you.will see drastic revenue and Eps growth over next 12 months. This is an easy double in 2020, but I actually see more. Get in now and accumulate before the street catches up!!!"
finally ;)
what's going on here?
So the market believes CRUS will lose apple. If that ever happens we will see CRUS trading at 20s
"Rhodes statement that the strategic measures would provide growth in 2020, doesn't necessarily bode well for 2019."
"If I had the cash myself I'd buy CRUS out tomorrow. Its hard to watch but it's becoming ridiculously cheap, market will wake up some morning. Patience, GL CRUS holders."
CRUS will be acquired in 21'.....mark this post
Found this interesting to read. I'll be staying long and adding to my position.
"I hate to say it but when Apple vertically integrates their supply chain, Cirrus Logic is a $20 stock."
Buy IQ
CRUS reached a new 52 Week Low at 46.06
This stock is hard to figure. Great volume and strength in the rally over Thursday and Friday. But back in July 2017 things looked pretty good too. And look what happened after that. Slow bleed back to the low 30's. Will this time be different?
CRUS has a strong alliance with the largest company in the world (market cap)......10 years with Apple ~~ let the good times roll and celebrate the dips as an opportunity to buy!!! now green......:)
nice. it's GREEN
"And then God said, ""Let there be light!"""
"Masango 76, this phenomenon takes place many time with this and the market in general. The dated saying, “ buy the rumor sell on the News. Watch for a botomoning Event on the charts. The Debbie downers plant the story that certain product from CrusWill not be in the new apple Phones and or ear Pods etc. it is a very good company."
Jeremy’s gonna make a video abt it
Could a possible apple car also boost this stock? just wondering...
How is it down almost 10 percent am I in the twilight zone
This ain’t no jokas
Every year Seeking Alpha retreads the story that Cirrus Logic is headed for a downturn because Apple may drop them as a Supplier. I'd say its more possible they buy them than drop them.
CRUS currently trying to fill 60 hi level positions across their locations......something big is happening. Read the conference call there is some new technology they would not disclose but are very excited about.
Watch AAOI today. same sector and report 12:30 est
"As a former broker with Merrill and cognizant of technicals and fundamentals, I am still in the camp of the shorts. I have owned CRUS since 1995 with moderate trading. I do believe this company will succeed greatly in the near future, 2020-2021. But look at volume on these up days, nothing there. The funds control the shares so must beware of them selling. Lately, they like the action. CRUS just “melts up” these days. When market corrects and CRUS dips, then a buy, but these levels never held in the past with a PE in 30s. Perhaps times are a changing guys. Anyway, I’m now looking at AMD, ZIOP, T FLR. OK GOOD LUCK EVERYONE."
Bought some calls today
"The **only** good news in this report is that CRUS has $200M left in the share re-purchase program, and they're going to get a lot more bang for those bucks.In Q4, they re-purchased 1.4M shares at an average of $42.20.They'll get a much better price this time around."
how is this not over 90 atleast? we need some pr.
Apple should acquire cirus logic.
I find it hilarious that bad news upon bad news has stacked up against this company and still it holds strong. proud to be a shareholder
Are comments being deleted? Most recent comment 2 days ago?
$40.00 -$50.00 is normal price for such stock ... even $72 is too high ! Never deal with APPLE ! They will always let you down ! That is why Korean companies refused to do Electric cars for Apple .
In at 51. Holding for 1 yr
Someone’s buying big today
Buying more today :)
"On the Skyworks earnings call tonight: ""Unit declines in mobile are expected."" SWKS missed their number on revenue, and warned for next quarter in their lower earnings and revenue guidance, because of weak cell phone business from Apple. CRUS gets over 80% of their revenue from Apple."
"this one needs patience, God bless"
the markets calling a bottom for crus.....now a proper valuation can get priced in.....Apple and its phone is a stable market and money maker for crus.....trust that crus will enter other markets ~~ they have a track record for success and been around for over 30 years!!
It should be up at least $12
Stonk tank. Jeremy effect
don't sell
I have a feeling it’s already priced in 10% usually Before earnings it goes downI have a feeling that YouTube guy is pumping the stock and people Paying a premiumLet’s see Hopefully he’s right
thoughts on the rise the last 2 days?
"I’m short now with options. Keep rolling up. But now sold 36.5 call may 10 weekly.Pulled in 3300 so far rolling up from 36s. Like long term but looking for drop after earnings.. if not, roll on or just deliver my shares. Basis low teens so okay. Ear Pods loss ignored it seems."
"Simple technical basics are you don't get into a stock when the 50 dma is below the 200 dma. 50-Day Moving Average 3 39.91200-Day Moving Average 3 41.29This can bounce as its sitting right at the 50 dma but until that event occurs most stocks tend to whipsaw with little institutional support. I'm compelled to buy a few shares here but I don't like the fundamentals worth a damn. Again, I think MU is a much better bet and has much better fundamentals, pays a dividend and shouldn't be trading as low as it is. Revenue growth is great and not the case with this one. They are trying to dig themselves out of a hole from their 52 week high of $64 its been a spiral down. Just saying. Do your homework!"
It seems there's a lot of worry about iPhone sales:https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/Largan-Precision-shares-plunge-on-report-of-sales-drop
No one talks about Android design win or the fact that the 80% from Apple includes accessories and not just handsets
"APPL moving to create it’s own chips for the MacBook is surely bad news for this stock. With the amount of cash on APPL’s balance sheet, it’s only a matter of time before they bring development of iPhone chips in house. Reminds me of the Warren Buffet thesis that KO should have started making their own bottles etc."
The 7 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy  Check out https://youtu.be/0KMtEGgad14
Zacks equity research firm had analysts predicting a miss on earnings. Well isn’t something of all the times they blow it. My thoughts they are looking out for only themselves to benefit in turning the tables and investing the other way. It sure seems that way when I look at the stock movement of this high of percentage.
"I've owned this stock on and off over the years and the price behavior of this thing at earnings has been a mystery.This is one of the few exceptions , when they beat it normally goes down . Great company but the stock is a weird one."
"mk, Grade, al, etc....... since it's likely and before everyone abandons this new message board, is anyone planning on moving to another message board? Please advise..... there was a great group of folks on the CRUS board. GLTA"
got my shares back 13 pts below my sell one month ago or so.....in at 41.10 as the stock continued jumping as i was buying.....buy when the worst news is out.....crus has been around for over 30 years and has a very healthy relationship with aapl......diversification into other applications is happening and will propel the stock higher sooner than you think.....buy cheap sell higher....:)
This company has zero PR other than earnings.
missed by 15%
Jeremy is the man!!!
Jeremy just mentioned this
this is going to the moon after earnings
Did Cirrus's CEO murder some babies or something? ???
i am a buyer.....cheap valuation is the reason AND i think in a few hours the price paid will be higher!!
What a #$%$ stock. Good earnings announcement and everyone dumps the stock.
pos stock
Holy smokers this ain’t no jokers! Cruzy Doozy to the moon
"Zacks has a standard of a form word for word, just changing numbers and the name when analysts expect a decline in earnings. Research firms as such, and there are many that should have some consistency of being right, should be graded and not allowed to publicize their opinions when badly predicting as much as Zacks does. Due diligence is using research firms as part of the formula before buying or selling. Most of the time it’s not right and SEC should do something."
"Apple will sell a TON of phones this Christmas. Not to mention, CRUS has the new airpods coming out very soon. Another source of income coming in."
not so bad right??
jeremy says to buy
It’s about to break out towards 90
Is it bad that I'm hoping the price falls some more?I know that someone has a budget of $250M for the purchase of CRUS and I want them to get a discount...
long
"nice recover,"
"Nice recovery after ER oversell. But just think, if the Sleepy Creepy ""Big Guy"" wasn't running his piehole, the re-accumulation would be triplefold."
CRUS just dropped 6% after hours on guidance cut
Bailed out at 44.50
"Good to see the stock price going up, given how well the company did and also, its a great company as well. I dont have any position ,but good luck to longs."
Put my short in yesterday @ 96 x 1000 shares. Big miss on earnings coming up on Monday. This gets sliced down.
this stock is amazing
"This thing is ready to run up, cup with handle with a very nice 20% handle"
Sell sell sell. Stock is no good
Tesla doesnt make earnings by 9% and it jumps 11%. Crus crushes earnings by 300% and it fall 8%. What THE >>> is going on?!?!
"At least 80% of CRUS's revenue is tied to Apple. Other AAPL suppliers have already warned about their revenue going forward, and yet CRUS defies logic, trading at almost $40.50."
"Looks like it’s going back north to 90 , after hours I believe crus will crush the numbers and projects much higher revenues for the next quarter and that might add another $11 to 15 on top"
"Assuming a conservative DCF approach, I end up with an intrinsic value around 53-55$. Waiting for it to go below 50 before getting a small position. And we shall see from there..."
Will skyrocket tomorrow
