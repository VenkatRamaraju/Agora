"Ouchie ! Ralph Burchaniti crying while driving around Carmichael circle. Why, why he says why did he buy so much EQT and now loose so much money! Maybe a few more drinks at Solomon's that will help right. Keep drinking Ralph, it helps ease the pain you have a lot of pain. LOL ! ROFLMAO!"
CBFV up $2.85 I don't know if there was an unwinding of a short position .but I doubt it. Look for this bank to be taken over-only a question of time! I see a broker has a $31 target.

"Community bank will be filing for Bankruptcy. Best to get all your money out before the doors are chained shut. Everyone is withdrawing at the ATM on Greene Street . . . There is no saving this bank this time. Too many loans can't be paid back by failing Gas, Oil and Coal companies. Employees are being laid off."
