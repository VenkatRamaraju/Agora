People are underestimating the power of yeezy
"This is not responding to their ""earnings"" report, the negative press regarding the non-payments, etc. I don't care what language they think will get them out of their back rent, etc.....they will have to defend themselves, which isn't cheap, and face masks aren't going to turn this around.No new credit facility, had already said it burned through half the cash on hand, 512.2 percent miss, etc,What am I missing?"
"I read that Gap's monthly rent liability overall is above 115 million per month. Is that correct?Did not pay April. What about May, June, July, Aug.? That comes to $575 MM. Have they paid any?"
The devil my opp !!!
Gap was struggling with cash flow and is now being sued by Simon... What do you guys think?
"Nice dip, adding more  I guess some people don’t understand the power Of yeezy haha he’s gonna blow up gaps market "
Constant delay's for Kanye's Donda album just like the constant delay's for Gap/Yeezy collab. Gap are a joke if they let kanye delay the yeezy collab till next year.
"This will keep going down. Stores are closed. I work for banana republic and yesterday they sent me an email telling me that they will remain closed until this pandemic ends. This goes same to all gap stores. The online sector ain’t selling like they used to so... those are the results, a falling rocket ."
Kanye is the only one going to benefit from this collaboration. investors are happy they were able to get out on friday. gap always get filled. if you look at the 15 min chart it looks like a lot of investors unloading. the last candle stick is a reversal to the downside.
If Macy’s had good earnings gap would have great warnings
They trying to get in for cheap I see….
How many think this will tank after earnings? It did last time. Don’t know how good the holiday sales were but is it enough to be profitable this time around compared to last ER?
Share price will be held in check for the expiring options tomorrow. Next week we'll see big moves down!
Killed all the call options.
IM BUYING ANYTHING ALL THE WAY UP TO 28.75 WATCH TOMORROW NICE SHORT SQ
"GPS ---What a good problem to have..... too much sales on e-commerce....GPS should bring the boxes to the UPS centers to drop off or use Fed Ex, rather than have UPS pick up from their stores....This tell you GPS on line sales are GREAT...Let accumulate more GPS from today's sell off. GPS should bounce back above $22 this week and heading to $24-$26 by end of Dec 2020 YE.BRIEF-UPS Slaps Shipping Limits On Gap, Nike To Manage E-Commerce Surge- WSJREUTERS 11:39 AM ET 12/2/2020 Dec 2 (Reuters) -* UPS SLAPS SHIPPING LIMITS ON GAP, NIKE TO MANAGE E-COMMERCE SURGE- WSJ Source text: https://on.wsj.com/2JAiyaL Further company coverage:"
This stock can easily double itself if the YEEZY line is a success
people rushing to the exits at gps.
FEW DAYS AGO THIS WAS 29.30 SO THIS WILL OPEN OVER 29.30 I KNOW FOR SURE
Keep playing and upgrading companies who refuse to pay their rent! Makes so much sense! Great foundation fundamentals!! Don't get better than that!
"so much enthusiam for gps, so little gain. Will gps end the day red?"
Maybe GPS is dropping as US debacle in Afghanistan hurts US based global merchants?
secured my jacket
I SHORTED HHAHA I SHORTED HAHAHA HAHAH
GPS just mentioned on Mad Money! Cramer not a fan.
GPS wish for the New Year
Expect a 20% jump when good news is announce!
"This is gonna drop like a rock when they cut the dividend. Closing stores, cost cutting, grasping for straws..."
Driving this down below 26 before earning. Then it will even drop more. Before it goes up. Hold tight and wait for your gift
Just wait for the Kardashians to start wearing Kanya's GAP gear. It will be affordable style that will fly off the shelves!
"Just bought this dip might be over, nice price ."
Goodluck to all GPS longs you can deduct your losses off of your income taxes. Going to $10 the deal with WalMart just destroyed GAP brand. Kanye can't save this ship good luck all peace out.
Yeezy Gap aint even drop yet
Y’all realize they paid him in shares also right ? He has all the incentive in the world to grow this company
The potential for Kanye to revive this brand is UNDENIABLE. His influence on pop culture and fashion is unmatched expect by maybe HIS WIFE. If you’re over 35 years old you may not understand this but looking at yeezys impact on adidas makes this quite obvious. That being said I think this stock has gotten a bit ahead of itself and people have started to chase. I’m out but looking to get back in under 14 or so.
Goodluck to all of you GPS longs you can always deduct some of your losses when this GPS goes to $10
Holy mama this will soar tomorrow #DONDA
Price already up
doesn't matter. the new normal will be less stores more online shopping and private shoppers. This will just change the way we are shopping today but wiöl generate more revenue for GAP in the long run. the Kanye Kardashian magic will boost this and eventually all the new collections will becsold begore it even hit the market. people will buy more quality brands thst lasts longer and can be used again and again. GAP will be minimom 30 USD by next year. I won't try to time this and hope to get in lower. i will just add more in case it dips. but overall I believe we will continue higher short and long term.
"The market clearly likes GPS's ""Power Plan2023"" presentation, but I'm finding it pretty bad.For example, ""Return to profitability in 2021"" should have been the presentation title in the press release. Marketing even matters when it comes to stocks."
GPS is CHEAP!!!!!!!! Kanye west has a Midas touch! ￼
Only millennials and zoomers understand how significant this 10yr Collab is.
Kanye gone bring this brand mainstream
Just one word for earnings: “BLOCKBUSTER”
"This shld be higher, not sure why the lack luster movement."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloombergquint.com/amp/onweb/simon-countersues-gap-over-107-million-in-lease-payments
"Before its tumble, GAP was an $18+ stock, now it's trading at $28. How is this company, with their massive retail footprint and mostly failing brand portfolio, worth more post-pandemic than before? And please don't say Kanye."
"Yeezy spring line with Gap comes out late March..., load up, smoke up, and watch all the online Yeezy items sell out in minutes!!!! I’ll stick to my Walmart hoodies and make money off this Chicago hustle! Pay $22.00 for this stock and make $100 +. Enjoy your $400.00 sweatshirt!! My retirement accounts appreciate you! We want YEEZY! . Chi- Town represent!!!"
Huge news with Simone Bilas leaving Nike to join GAP bc Nike doesn’t line up with her values. But movement!!
"Just looked at clothes on website. They are not appealing, especially women’s. They were just pumping Athleta on CNBC. The stuff looks cheap and uncomfortable, is no Lulu. I don’t see this doing well based on fundamentals."
Sorry to all the longs. I had some calls from yesterday and that's why I didn't go up. I bought some out of the money calls 27 strike and it opened up higher and my option went down lol. Never ever has that ever happened for me that a gap higher my call goes down
Yeezy x Gap logo has been licensed
TOMORROW BE A VERY NICE HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE U SEE
"I’m bullish on gap but sold for earnings, will be buying the dip"
"The news is fantastic. They can't pay their rent and their stores are closed. Since their credit rating is so high, borrower, they easily managed to borrow money to refinance their debt. Who in their right mind could deny that GPS is one of the best stock bargains on the planet. A 30% increase should be just around the corner and then to new highs. In fact, the entire stock market should hit new highs shortly given the glorious news from around the country and the leadership of America's greatest president."
GPS will be purchased by private equity and split into 3 companies. In the meantime share buybacks will shrink the float and provide more room for dividend increases.
Gap be Easy Easy Over $29 to $30 tomorrow Look Holidays coming Kids going back to School so People buying online or offline ok from these stores.
The Gap is down 5.47% to 29.31
"I just bought a put on this for these reasons: its traded at double the average as of this post 10mil vs 5mil, they are closing 230 stores, the split of old navy will not happen until sometime in 2020. This will drop significantly by the end of next week as people are going to start taking profits."
one good day on the market and the retail section will soar!! look what happened last week...
Nice segment from josh brown on CNBC about gps! Interesting play.
"When Kanye said about not being on the Gap board, ""That has to change TODAY, or I walk away"", was that a calendar, 24 hour day, or was it a biblical day?"
Fire sale
"ANY 28.00 OR 28.20, 28.30 28.40 BEST BUY IT JUST LOOK AT 5 DAYS CHART NICE CUP AND HANDLE AND GOES TOWARD $29-$30 WATCH"
Bought 500 at 27.40
If you sell this before the yeezy gap colab comes out you should stop investing- just give up and buy some boring dividend
"GPS = GPS will have a good Black Friday online sales with the brand name: OLD NAVY, ATHLETA, it is surprised that the COVID 19'S mask sales accounts for 4% sales across the company's as they are the favorite of younger customers.With today's market close early at 1 PM, GPS's price will perform much better next week at least between $22.75 to $24 . Should start accumulating more GPS shares at this deep discounts value."
I imagine GAP might be the new Champion and Kappa which were also revived in the clothing industry.
Gap Is going over $28.50 over $29 toward $30 tomorrow watch
The Gap is up 5.69% to 27.85
I bet gap are nervous about Biden new corporate tax to 28% and 15% tax on 100 million book profits.
On fire!! Buy buy...
"“On my cell in my cell tonight, don’t have to see you to touch you, this is what Braille look like, it’s on sight…”"
I added more under $29
WATCH AND LEARN BOYS GAP WILL HAVE RECORD EARNINGS AND A GREAT OUTLOOK LOADED 1500 SHARES AT 26.16
Another Cramer fav down the tubes lol
"“Can we get much higher” - Kanye west , and the answer is yes, Mars to be exact "
Bill gates said today next 4 to 6 moths will be worse for the virus.
How is that double upgrade working out for you now?
"Big Rally coming?Nothing but positives.YOY performance points to incredibly positive developments. Stock is up about 30%. Revenue is flat, about 16b. Earnings 30% of year ago, 350m vice 1b. Dying, high overhead business model - brick and mortar. Macroeconomic factors significantly degraded from year ago. Yet, with hopium an FOMO, this will probably hit $50 in next few weeks. Do not let this profit opportunity to slip by you. Just buy."
Earning report today. Any thought? Why this forum is so quiet?
loaded 3000
BYE BYE SHORTS
So happy there's hope in Retail bought at 16 and going for the long ride to 55 by year end 
Excellent earnings are coming. This stock will go to 40
"This is the biggest #$%$ on the street. About to throw in the towel. Everyday, the bears take it lower and challenge the bulls. Nothing but positive news and it simply won?t go higher."
Should be interesting how the gap handles the $15 minimum wages for all store worker it’s going to get passed this year.
Further Downside?
why we are stuck at 13?
"If it gets below 30, I start adding"
"My estimated value of NewCo and Old Navy which I’ll combine into pre-split prices to show you where I think it should trade before it splits.NewCo:The trick here is most all of our value is coming from Athleta. 2018 sales were around $1.1 billion. It is growing at 30%. Has about 9% after tax net margins (assuming their Corporate tax rate of 26%). I estimate it should fetch a realistic multiple of 27.5 X earnings. To be more conservative if it grows at average 22.5% this year and next sales will be estimated at $1.65 Billion in 2020 when the split happens. At 9% we get earnings of $148.50 million. A 27.5 multiple of this gives us a market cap value of $4.1 Billion about. I’m going to go lower on my combined Gap, Banana, Intermix, Janie & I don’t care. The combined of that should conservatively fetch $300 million I believe. I used to be higher on these numbers but have come down and given it an aggregate earnings multiple of just 3X earnings to be on the ultra-conservative side. So you can see I get an aggregate value of NewCo (which clearly should be named Athleta) of $4.4 Billion.Old Navy:I will make this simple. Let’s be conservative and only assign a 8.5 X earnings multiple (which was even lower than Gap’s pre-split announcement multiple). Sales were $7.8 billion in 2018. Let’s say $8.2 billion in 2019. Let’s say 2020 of $8.4 billion. They have fantastic margins, better operating than Athleta. After tax assigning a 26% (their corporate effective tax rate) and assuming margins are at a little above 12% (rather than their 14-15% range they’ve enjoyed), to be safe, that gives us an after tax net margin of 9% (similar to Athleta). 9% of $8.4 billion in sales is a profit of $756 million. 8.5 x $756 million = $6.4 Billion. Though I really do believe it deserves a better multiple than 8.5x because of their great business model, loyal customer base and high margins. But for this valuation I like to play it safe.The isolated market caps post-split I just estimated should bake into the pre-split market value as we get to 2020 when it happens. The combined company conservatively should be $10.80 billion ($4.4 billion Athleta/NewCo and $6.4 billion Old Navy). There are 380 million shares now, they will buy back 10 million easily I believe over this next 10-14 months, so I’m computing final market valuation over 370 million shares outstanding. This gives us a $10.80 billion market cap divided by 370 million shares outstanding so we get a market price of $29.19 under my analysis. At this prices this gives investors lots of incentive to buy Old Navy at a cheap price of 8.5 times earnings and a fast growing company Athleta at P/E’s that are lower than Nike, LuLu but nonetheless the market reward high growers like Athleta with a multiple of that nature.So I am a buyer here and would gladly hold both new companies post-split."
"Considering that the Yeezy&Gap products will be available worldwide there is a huge potential of stock getting 2x the price if not more by the end of the year. Look at what Kanye has done for Adidas after their sneakers, I am holding 240@13.55"
yeezy gap
Earnings report is out. Smashed it.
nothing incredible but perfectly fine numbers
"Kohl's stock off 16% today on drop in revenue, but smaller than projected loss. Same malls, but Kohl's is paying rent. What will happen when Gap reports next week? I believe it will drop much more than Kohl's."
Something is dropping tonight. Check Gap’s Instagram.
"Good news is coming soon , hold & buy."
"All retail stocks earlier sold off i.e. KSS, M, BBBY, etc.... have been in green right now. Expect GPS to be GREEN by the close.Reason: OVERSOLD bounce !!!!"
Keep it 300 like the romans.
Apparently this one likes it slow and steady
Stock is out of touch with reality. They owe over 66million in rent to Simon malls. They have far fewer stores than this time last year and at a 52 week high? They are going down. There are plenary of stocks that have room to push up from the covid shutdown. This one is at the very end of any run it might have had.
"Trading at a little above 9 P/E here. Very good risk reward. Healthy balance sheet. Almost 4% dividend. $1Billion buyback. Management definitely seems to be going in the right direction too. Made a large bet and like it as an investment not trade at these levels. Hedged it by selling the Jan 2020 $30 calls and brought in $1.37 or an extra 5.5% and giving me +30% upside total return between dividends, calls and price gains."
What’s everyone opinion hold or sell before earnings? It can pop up tomorrow like footlocker
Loaded more shares GAP is setting to EXPLODE
"This shld be a 40$ stock by years end, period"
trading for 40% of sales and pays 5.4% dividend. and LULU is trading 7x sales . i guess the market doesn't like value
http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/gap-inc-expands-in-groveport-creating-600-new-jobs
"old navy and it's athletic sales growth very strong,see customers rankings, people very love it,I think GPS can reach$100 per share."
West day ever June 26th
"Conventionally, there is only one way to escape leasehold contracts for the approximately 3000 stores of Gap's 5 nameplates, and that is BK. I don't say that their business is beyond repair, though Kanye will cause more trouble than he could ever be worth. I don't say that stores are bad. But it is clear, that too many stores, and stores that are too big, is deadly. (e.g. Bed Bath and Beyond)"
"GPS is spinning off Old Navy because AMZN is interested in buying Old Navy and this is the best way to determine a fair value for that portion of the business. I speculate that AMZN made an offer to GPS for Old Navy that GPS felt was not fairly valued, the best solution was to spin it off to come up with a fair market value. AMZN is going for world domination an established clothier is on their target list, Old Navy would fit right in."
Doing really well today! Next stop $40
I am a little bit scared of holding. His market wants to drop everything. Gap might drop to 20 tomorrow but long term is a strong buy
Kanye! Kanye! Kanye! What else do you need? Elon Musk to tweet this stock???
"The Sept 12 presentation shows Old Navy with EBITDA of $1.4B and growing at 7%. At 6x EBITDA it is worth $8.4 or $2.4B more than the value of the whole company today. That then assumes all the rest is worthless including Athleta. Thye have $2.3B in debt so we need to figure that in the mix. Old Navy will take some of that. GPS has retired $1B of stock over the last 3 years and continues to buy at a $300M rate or 5% of the stock each year. The dividend, capex of $700M, share buybacks are all funded out of cash flow. It is selling like an emminent bankruptcy at 4.5x EBITDA. The dividend looks safe. The spin off of old Navy may result in no dividend for old Navy but keeping the dividend for GPS in which case the stock would go up 100% and still yield 5.5%. We will see. They have a lot of flexibility."
"They can't pay their rent, but somehow they're worth double what they were worth few months ago? Lol...Amazon is king of the retail jungle."
"The consumer discretionary sector which GPS, KSS belong have come back and currently ranks 3rd in allsectors' performance today. There are money moving into this as many retail stocks are OVERSOLD. KSS has come back 50% from earlier sold off. GPS should be followed soon. Trying to break in $31 resistancelevel. Needs to break $31 level today in order to rise to $33 near term."
GPS is the back-to-school and child tax credit beneficiary!
remember the ESPP plan will buy soon and maybe they want to raise price to get more revenue?I sold 792 shares
Just sold my shares at $17. I bought in at $12 recently. Looks like this is going to tank. If it goes to $12 again I'm back in long.
Kanye is bringing this to the moon- yeezy colab has not even been released yet.
Gap is cool
Sales down 52%.....but lets go back to a 52 week high!
This is going to pop
"GPS: GPS stock will rise to at least $35 as every single teenager will wear this the Yeezy Gap item is called the 'Round Jacket'. Time to buy this OVERSOLD , GREAT VALUE ""GPS STOCK"" WITH NICE DIVIDEND ALSO."
Careful. Which is better. 15% decline or 15% gain. Its your money!
SHORT NOW NO 28.60 NO 28.75 HAHAH SHORT NOW
Ah could be interesting
Did anyone get their Yeezy's yet?
Getting to take off
Kids on tik tok are talking about Gap being a trend in 2021. If Gap catches on with gen z this could soar.
not sure what brilliant minds were buying this last week. did they not read the ER. This will make a new 52 week low. enjoy your loses. $10 stock.
"Hold this Long and Strong baby! Another GAP up in the AM. This will virtually be a stock split. Basically 2 great brands separating to do what they do best. New investors will buy in the NEWCO and old investors will stick with Old Navy and buy more. This is a wonder deal. Combined stocks value will be worth double in less than a year after spin off, minimum IMO. Brands are good, and getting laser focused now. New $1 billion buyback program. Lookout, big things coming for one of the most under-values retailers in the industry, but not for long! BUY for the long-term!"
Investor hype. The Gap hasn't lifted a finger yet.The company will buy back shares at a lower level.
"For those that dont know, Kanye used to work for the GAP before he was famous. Hes been pushing for this since 2013, and he will push this collab hard. For an example of the Ye effect, look at what happened to Adidas in 2015."
"Lol did that Mickey Mouse article actually cause this dip though? That guy is 74 years old, he does not know the influence yeezy has on fashion. And what does he mean it won’t work because Kanye isn’t corporate ?? Is he not aware of adidas? Total boomer moment…"
These recent creative collaborations incredibly increase GPS margins! More innovation programs upcoming in this back-to-school season!
Get ready for Kanye’s surprise tmr! That’s why market makers working so hard today! LOL
If youre smart you would sell today before it tanks tomorrow with the unemploymemt numbers and terible virus cases
"Just looked at a Yeezy tee shirt: $320. If you want them to tear it for you, it will be $465. Now, GAP? I also read that Halston brand was sold to JC Penney's. Both gone. That took time, but what took decades before, now happens in a year or less. Gap was already circling the drain, this deal just makes it more certain."
38 billion dollars expected to be spend this back school shopping season. Hopefully Gap will capture over 3% of those dollars . Looks like I buy signal
Gap was at 18 before the virus started this will bring it back and then some. Hold for the long term folks we have a 10-year ride ahead
"I bought back in April just as a long term gamble, but you know it’s going to jump when once the yzy line is released, which is likely next year. I’d hold it for 1 year and get the maximum profit."
"Got worried seeing this huge rally before the results. Sold off my shares. Hope to buy it back based on the results and stock price after the results, if the valuation looks good"
"Personally I think this is one of the easiest stocks to make sense of. Forget fundamentals, forget economic moats, P/E ratios and all that good stuff. I know Gap owns multiple companies, (Old Navy and others), but this is stock will rise or fall largely based on one man, Kanye Weet. Kanye's (plus his wife's family) impact on culture and fashion cannot be understated. (look at $ADDYY from Jan 2019 until covid hit) If/when Kanye can make Gap ""cool"" and create hype the stock will skyrocket. The good news is Kanye is Elon Musk level genius at creating hype/making things cool. the bad news is Kanye is terrible at following through and completing things."
When has anyone ever told Kanye what to do?
Looks like GAP lost Times Square rent dispute. Must pay!!!
Nice bounce.
I see a pretty mix bag here but more people leaning toward the shorting and over value of this stock and I completely disagree with that. I believe this stock will explode In The next 1-2 years and maybe even more in the future. I think people and even gap are under estimating the sales for yeezy gap cloths. The margins on these are going to be crazy not to mention the hype around it on top of that it will most definitely sell out as soon as it’s out with people buying to resell. I personally see gap following a similar to the rise of the champion clothing brand. If you remember champion started as a discount Retail brand but with collaborations with other brands champion grew to a very popular street wear brand and I think gap will follow a similar tragedy after this partnership with yeezy. Plus gap isn’t just going to stop selling affordable cloths in large quantities just adding a new level to their business. I hold a few shares myself not very many tho if I had more money to put in I would probably buy more gap
Started a position today in Gap at 33.50. Very bullish on this company for the summer
"Fall and winter promise to drive more people indoors and bring about flu season, and experts say Americans need to be consistent in following guidelines. Mask wearing, social distancing and avoiding large crowds will be key, experts say, along with authorities increasing testing as infections surge again.Worldwide, the US dubiously ranks No. 1 in the total number of reported deaths and fifth per 100,000 people."
"Simon Property, and Brookfield are offering to buy JC Penney's out of Bankruptcy and continue to operate them. Know why? Because in some malls, the tenants have a clause in their leases that permit them to leave if the anchor store, (dept. store) closes. Simon Property Group is buying Penney's to hold the smaller tenants, like Gap, to their leases."
I heard about GPS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Be patient everyone. 2022 earning will be amazing. Kanye fans are on another level. Look how quickly the jackets sold.
DONDA
"“Pray 5 times a day, so many felonies.. who gon post my bail, lord help me..DONDA.. I’m with your baby when I touch backroad.. Told him stop all that red cap, we going home!!” “HOVA and YEEZUS.. like Moses and Jesus.. your not in control of my thesis”"
Someone make this pullback I need to buy 10k shares cheaper. Come on!! Someone hear me please
"So if Abercombe and fitch is worth $36, then gap must be worth $60, by far lot more market share internationally, don't believe all the bull about supply shortages. Theirs a lot of container ships parked off the cost of California. NO SUPPLY SHORTAGE JUST DELAY IN GETTING THE SHIPS EMPTIED,"
By Sept- Oct Time this be Over $40 Per Share so Just Think buying 10k Shares u make good amount of Money so Im doing that for Sure
Watch this pop tomorrow
When is GPS expected to be profitable again?
Holding up pretty good with reporting over a billion dollar loss
"Originally bought at 30+ for dividends, made myself stop my losses at around 24. No investment expert here, but IF you think the bull market will continue to run, there are just way too many better companies with clearer identities and better prospects. If you think the bubble is bursting before Nov 2020, I don't see how GPS is a safe bet either."
This is going to 40. Goldman Sachs is never wrong
And it's time to get a chance. Added at $26.60.
Is the Kanye West thing still happening? Won't Gap rocket in sales with that? Kayne has a good presence around him. Spiritual and good.
Yeezy season approachin’…..
35$++ easy tomorrow$$
don't panic sell with ceo stepping down and guidance lowered. art peck had to go a long time ago. gap needs this change up. good things will happen after this. wait and see.
"Buy the trends!!! this is how trends work... media.. media.. media. Celebrity... media. Plug power... media.. media.. Amazon.. media.. Walmart.. media..celebrity.. media. Biden.. media..BOOM ! I also invested in GPS. I understand the power of Media and celebrity... if you want to make a decent return on some play money... buy GAP $GPS.., the Yeezy line next year will make more money for GAP than they ever had in their entire lifetime. Hold for 5 years then sell. Everyone will be tired of YEEZY by then and you’ve made enough money to buy a tank top at Walmart and and rent a small yacht for the summer, Follow the trends... H2 is a trend.. the next new thing won’t be around for another 25 years..,by then you’ll be rich!!! My PLUG is LONG AND STRONG!! Literally and metaphorically."
Gap will most likely be acquired
Up tomorrow
Amazon might buy gap.
I love this stock. It's backed by God.
"I think it's obvious why GPS is down today...they cut their dividend in half. Yes, they announced continuation of buybacks, but shareholders want that dividend."
EPS is negative-0.17. Cash flow negative -295million. Revenue is -18%. Their cash position went up because they haven’t paid rent. I see it as negative result compared to other companies. We will know tomorrow when markets open or maybe in couple of hours.
Athleta alone will carry gap
LOOK AT THE CHART
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"LOCK AND LOAD BABY, GAP IS GOING TO SMASH EARNINGS BOUGHT ANOTHER 330 SHARES AND CALLS ARE FLYING OFF THE WALL!!"
Kanye deal announced to release by end of June
Even Jon Najarian and another analyst (can't remember her name on halftime today) cant move this. Actually -.05 aint too bad for good ole GPS. Didn't they just have earnings recently.
"Drifting off into space........I'm buying everything I can. It is like the algos or someone has the sell button on and are just challenging the bulls to buy it or they will take it zero. Delta variant, when does it end? The media, the govt, and the CDC can't let a good crisis end. Back to school shopping is upon us, following a great retail summer season (which is not over)."
And on Day 7....Green?
"Athleta, a Gap brand, today unveiled its first-ever sleep collection, furthering its growth and reinforcing its position as a true lifestyle brand. Available today, the sleep collection aims to support women holistically and recognizes the importance of rest and recovery in her active life."
"Wow, drops a point off the high as the market melts up, somebody knows something and it aint good"
TOMORROOW AT OPEN THIS BE $29 PROMISE U U SEE
Amazing how it beats and hardly moves. Biggest moves are always PM or AH. Sad. time to move on
"Buying more now. If it opens at 8%, it has a chance to go to 20%. look at Macys, opened 8% and closed 20% up. Gap is stronger company than Macys."
Im Buying More IM Adding to my position I know this going To $35 $40 by End of Sept
"Positive sentiments from Wells Fargo with a $30 price target. Management is consolidating and saving money, that's great news."

Volume is increasing slowlyGrab ur last chance and then we will go on ride its not gonna stop trust meGood company with awesome earning and management!!!
"We will see this week if Josh Brown is correct regarding GPS. I used to shop at Gap, but lately the clothes are really expensive, $75 for a pair of Gap jeans. Are they serious?"
I do think this is a long term investment. There are other good retail investments as well but this one is cheap. The others have already gone up in price. Shorts are pretty much screwed for the next few years if they stay here.
Kohl’s has only 1150 stores. Gaps has 2750 stores. SG&A is not something that easy to manage. More pain ahead.
"I am calling 34 today. Undervalued Oversold. Look at Retail performance since May 1st. Just go the Malls. The Traffic alone. Stick with the proven business models that work, not the fluff hope and dream hype stories that trend in 2021."

"Love the Blue jacket! wow so cool, no zippers or buttons, love it."
I'm confused why anyone would sell because old bag Mickey told Kanye he shouldn't have done the deal? The fact is THEY DID THE DEAL. #$%$ is wrong with people?
Its the beginning of back to school week try hold on and drop some changes in LOTE
Looking at historical data GPS only goes up a few dollars then retracts then goes back up a week later
"@Charlie how's your math?The 2Q 10-Q stated, and keep in mind this is for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, not just 2Q:""an increase of $320 million related to accounts payable primarily due to the suspension of rent for stores closed temporarily as a result of COVID-19"""

Guys what will be a good price point to buys some? LIke $16 or lower?

"The stock of the GAP as well as the market is heading to new highs. The best new yet: the company is running out of money and stopped paying rent, The S and P should hit new highs due to the 26 million unemployed and the prospect of 7.5 million small businesses in the United States being at risk of closing over the next five months (3.5 million businesses are at danger of permanent closure with the possibility that approximately 35.7 million employees of these businesses facing unemployment). Hallelujah!"
"Today was an overreaction. GPS isn't worth $29, but it is a $23-$24 stock all day long. Shorties need to pipe down."

"Vip, not likely as most of their ""attacks"" have been companies on the verge of bankruptcy or at the minimum very weak positions. I think they are using their huge gains from Tesla, Bitcoin and a few other exceptional high fliers as Casino money and just playing the field on Hedge Funds that are heavily concentrated on certain stocks, acting as such in a way that Robin Hood would for beleaguered investors in those companies."
SMASHED EARNINGS
Big volume coming in
"I can't help but shake my head when I read some of the comments here: ""GAP can't pay its rent"", ""bankruptcy is coming"", and so on. I'm long this stock and here's why: (1) GAP survived the pandemic while some of its peers did not and this will have a positive effect on GAP's market share, (2) DB has a price target of $15 and WF $19, (3) for the past three months the trend is up and the longer-term trend puts this stock at $20-23 within 12-18 months, (4) shoppers will spend like crazy once they're able to get out and shop again, (5) Kanye's line will boost foot/online traffic even if people don't buy his clothing. The biggest risk to GAP's stock price is a Biden victory because that would probably pull down the S&P and take GAP with it."
"Ok, so if they had actually paid rent they would have lost $407 million, or ($1.08) per share. Totally fake beat, watch this drop like a rock tomorrow when the market realizes it was actually a huge miss. Gotta read the financials folks, earnings per share figures are just for headlines."
Earnings will be great due to athletes. That alone is worth the market cap of gap
"Bought this at $12.25, I am thinking I bought in way to early. I am not sure what to do with it now, sell or hold. I could sell and take a small loss"

"Lululemon is starting to look like an excellent short.Few reasons:1. Expensive valuation. Market Cap is more than the COMBINED value of $GPS $HBI $AEO EV/Sales > 62. limited growth prospects especially if they don't lower prices. Also seem like a Longshot for them to successfully launch in other product like shoes.3. At risk of becoming too 'cool and rich' for a public backlash it happen before think A&F, Victoria Secrets.4. Increasimg competition in the yoga space. Big brands like Nike are just now getting more serious about stealing lulu's customer. 5. Brands like ATHLETA are successfully growing as they concentrate marketing to all woman. They use models of all sizes, Lululemon uses just female models that under idk under 115lbs maybe, check Instagram. Isn't this the reason Victoria Secret is getting public shame over?6. International Growth won't be enough to keep premium valuation with any weakness domestically (North America).Go ahead please tell me I'm wrong, I don't follow Lulu very close but if it goes to $200 before $100 I'll be having a closer look."

"FBTweetMorePauseUnmuteCurrent Time 0:51/Duration 1:49 ShareCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreen×YOU MIGHT LIKEBEYONCÉ SURPRISES FANS WITH 'ALREADY' MUSIC VIDEO AHEAD OF 'BLACK IS KING' RELEASEKim Kardashian West and Kanye West's future remains unclear.The couple reunited for the first time in person on Monday after Kardashian flew to Cody, Wyoming, to visit the rapper, whose behavior in recent weeks has been increasingly erratic, including divulging deeply personal details about his family and marriage. In photos, the reality star, 39, was seen crying in the car with West, 43, and a source tells PEOPLE she ""feels that she has tried everything.""""She isn't getting back what she needs from Kanye,"" says the source. ""She was to the point that she flew to Cody to basically tell him their marriage is over and to say goodbye.""According to the source, it seems West still wants to work on the marriage — he recently apologized to his wife on Twitter — but hasn't yet taken steps to repair the relationship I apologize for reposting gossip, but I feel strongly that the Kardashian connection is central to Kanye's appeal as a fashion influencer. His brand is totally diminished without the Ks. Similar to Caitlyn's. Since the recent unwarranted strength in GPS is almost certainly based on retail investor's hopes that some design strength is needed at the brands, I see this as the absolute worst deal GAP could have made, and was done out of desperation and poor judgement. It's actually amazing that the divorce of two people who are celebrities only because the public knows who they are, can be the straw that breaks the back of the Gap camel carrying 3000 empty stores. Opinions? Will this potential divorce matter to Gap?"
Are earnings bad?
"Absolutely no fundamentals but its online sales are doing well, I guess you just have to have some 6 degree relationship to technology and your co will fly. What a joke. Time to pay the piper sooner or later."
I own shares up 70 percent still Idk if I should hold or sell for profit
This is gonna rocket soon. Lots a good things with the Kanye West thing.
"Covid-19 cases have been way up, and lots of companies do not provide salary increase or bonus, not sure why retail stocks are still shooting to the sky? Supposedly the new clothes are not essential items to buy in the pandemic."

when will Kanye & Gap collaboration plan to release its design fashions for holiday season or 2021????????????????
Are you guys still in GPS? They just got featured on the watchlist at (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
always short/buy put options just before earning for Gap. it always works.
Buy back helps stock price go up
"My guess is the the GAP knows they'll have to file bankruptcy, so why pay rent to Simon and Taubman?....they'll then have plenty of cash actually on hand after the bankruptcy to start over. The Mall owners will then just be unpaid creditors jockeying for renegotiated (smaller) leases."
Very Very Easy over $30 it might even go to $32
Barely holding on to gain after great earnings and a string mkt day. If mkt drops this will flush. Get out if you have any gain in this
Man did this stock plummet in the last 5 years...might be a good time to buy under 20

Slow bounce back I hope
"Might wait for next week for it to dip, but 2021 will be a great year for gap"

Anyone has any insight as to why GPS dropped so much today?
when is old navy spinoff?
Gap might be acquired by Amazon
"Valuation close to precovid level. Does not reflect loss of stores, brand footprint, loss of revenue, increased legal risk, lower guidance, weaker balance sheet and retired business line like hill city. Gps is pumped to dump and it’s back to $11"
Bullish for Gap loaded every dip and will continue to load every sale price
"GAP... a buy in the middle of a pandamic? The same store that a year ago was a struggling brick and mortar concept is embraced as a growth stock? COVID collateral damage is manifesting itself by adversely affecting the memory, judgement and decionmaking ability of large number of stock marker players. If GAP is a growth stock so is SEARS, JC PENNY, KMART The FOMO Express is departing in 3 minutes on track 12. All Aboard!!!!!"
Reversal starting very soon!
"Longs, put your stops in, this will drop tomorrow. It will go up long term, but once analysts study the notes to financials, the selling will begin. This will be over $20 by next year, but today it's overvalued IMO. Best of luck to all."
I went in Athleta yesterday and was impressed at the clothing choice and quality and the place was packed! Then I asked my 19 year old about the Kanye component and she got very excited because she didn't know about it. Bought some this morning!

"YO Mike I completely agree, GAP WILL SMASH EARNINGS"
This is a $14 stock at best. Current conditions and revenue values this at $11 and that’s if they can keep expenses low. Rent payroll distribution and s&m are crazy expensive
"Gap stock will announce a split by the end of this year, mark this post."
Apparently Universal released Kanye's album without his approval. Most likely due to his numerous delays. Gap should follow suit & release the yeezy collab without Kanye's approval otherwise we will probably waiting untill spring next year.
Tomorrow Gap will open i Say $29 or evern $30 Very good Earning and Outlook watch
I’ve got a bottle of willet rye on standby 
What does the deal look like. Does Gap benefit at all other than people coming on their site to buy clown shoes?
Great company with a awesome marketing team .
JUST LOADED 1000 SHARES GPS IS GOING UP UP UP AND AWAY
Why are we dipping? Did y'all not read the valuation of Kanye's Gap Deal?
Gap said it “remains optimistic” about the future. It expects fourth-quarter sales to be about equal to or slightly higher than a year ago. Analysts had been calling for a decline of 2.8%.
really glad I listened to my son and bought this at 12$$ last year
Is today the day? are we closing green? Yesterday it hit the support right where I thought it was going to and is looking like it will bounce. Let's go!

Thinking about getting some GPS. Never thought that retail stocks could trade like biotechs.

Will go to $9 range tomorrow. Bad earnings report.
I have been holding this stock since May. It has been going up consistently. The Athleta brand and old navy brand online sales are killin it. The funny thing is that I was gonna do a quick trade on this and just kept holding.
This market makers manipulation is the fortune in the making! LOL
What’s everyone’s thoughts on this drapr acquisition? I wonder what they paid for it...
Who’s shorting today?
anybody else think there should have been a much better reaction to earnings? I took a bigger position today because I loved what I heard from earnings but am I missing something?
The Gap is up 5.55% to 30.62
"The movement on this is unwarranted. Another 2% in after hours, really? Do folks really think that they are going to crush earnings and even if they do the stock has already risen 10% in less than two days."
"The Gap brand, which has flailed in recent years as it struggled with an identity crisis, has a new idea for how to finally end its misery: Kanye West. Gap's hope after smoking dope is that West's Yeezy label generates $1 billion in annual sales. Gap’s brand brought in $4.6 billion last year."

The release of 1 yeezy Gap item and it sells out super fast - stock rises 3.65% (at the time of writing this) 1 ITEM we have personably 100’s more coming in the coming months that will surely sell out fast as well this stock is just beginning don’t miss your time to buy before it goes crazy even after a big day this stock is still under valued!!
"GAP will be fine. Since people cannot go to ANY stores, online purchases will naturally increase and GAP is well positioned. They have one of the best online businesses in the clothing retailer space, particularly offering free returns which is hard to come by. The balance sheet is strong with ample cash on hand to weather a downturn and they are taking steps to preserve liquidity. This may go down more from here or go up but at some point in about a year there will be a vaccine and people will be shopping again with no fear. By then it will be too late to get a bargain as this could pop 30 to 40% in a day at its current price."
It's time to close the year Strong...$21's
Started adding today 220 shares.. this is good for a 60percent from here atleast. Adding another 80 shares each week for the next 2months
"Wow.....76C? How did they do that? Nice! And raised the yearly guidance to a higher range. This is a good report. DOn't care how street manipulates, but a well run business. Thank you management."
I dont have to worry about money no more
"New investor, this Yeezy deal is going to be huge! Kanye is single handily dominating the fashion world along with his close friend Virgil Abloh. Celebrity & influence has a major impact outside of fundamentals and analytics. This is just the beginning - 10 year deal! "
"Idk about you guys but I know Kanye is going to blow GAPs market. His stuff always sells, and resellers always want his products. I said screw it got 20 shares at $26. It’ll for sure get past 100 with how successful Kanye’s past collabs have been. Don’t miss out on this!!"
"No stock has gone so low, that can't go lower. In the case of THE GAP, The more you buy, The lower it goes & The longer you hold, The more you'll lose. Guaranteed."
Amazing results. I should have bought more...
"You have to be buying today. Makes no sense and when this occurs, you have to act."
"GPS' bond sales in April went well. They sold 2.25 billion carry an average interest rate of 8.6%. Mostly used to pay older debt coming due soon. On Feb. 1, they had about 1.7 B cash, by May 2 that was down to about 800 MM. They got a new revolver of 2 B at the same time. That would be adequate financing in an economic slowdown, but in a pandemic with unprecedented levels of unemployment and empty malls with 3000 stores to carry, who knows? Be aware, the 2.25 B in new bonds give first priority to the holders to all GPS assets and IP. I calculate this leaves little to nothing for shareholders. Kanye and his equity are worthless."
"So many people sleeping on this, yeezys for the most part are released and sold online, everything they make under the yeezy brand gets sold out. This is what they need to bring huge traffic to Gap’s online store."
Gap is up 7.96% to 27.40
"Worth $10B, just $4B behind AAL! No thanks!"
It's time to go back up to $26's or higher...Lots of Dec 31 $20.5 Calls were bought a few days ago. Some trader know?
https://discord.gg/Ak4Yr7Dy
Dropping. Smart money knows the earnings are fudged cause they didn't pay rent the entire Q2. This will break $15 tomorrow.
Apparently no one in here knows the impact of Kanye... Kanye just has to be seen in something once for it to be a trending high selling item. Once gap clothes have his name on them sales will take off
"They are basically closing down their whole European operation. The EU distribution centre in Rugby will have only 20 workers until December, and they will be totally closed after. ALL the retail shops will be closed, as well as the online store. this is a HUGE blow. The manager in EU announced it today this is a fact, not a rumor, a family member of mine works there."
"In an April filing with the SEC, Gap Inc. – which also owns Banana Republic – said it had stopped paying rent for its 2,785 North American retail stores due to the Covid-19-related costs of closing its stores, and complying with local restrictions since those outlets have reopened. All told, the firm said the rents came to $155 million.Gap appears to be the only major retailer employing this ""pay no rent"" strategy. Others are choosing BK.It is a risky strategy because contract law is well established. Then add on top of the rent, late penalties, and most of all, the enormous costs of litigation all over the U.S. Does anyone know of another major retailer trying this??"

If trade wars between China and the United States are responsible for a 30% decrease in stock value for Gap in 2019 what do you predict this Chinese originated pandemic is going to do to the worlds trade relations with China?
