"Very good news coming out soon , big investors will start buying"
Closing above the 20-day and on higher than average volume. Since corporate earnings have been so positive I imagine that shorts are starting to close their positions. Bloomberg noted today that Gap had a large increase in foot traffic and overall and sentiment is positive. This should get a lift in the next few weeks.
Cramer said on Mad Money last night that $GPS GAP is cheap and a good buy opportunity. I agree!
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"10/11 Monday morning Bummer: nominal GDP of USA is being revised LOWER to around 4% for 2021 and first half of 2022. Its all a guess work, but the red flags are propping up. Lower than expected unemployment report, value of dollar receding, oil and inflation up. All of these factors will have an impact on consumer purchasing power. This impacts consumer cyclical market stocks. I realize Levis, had stellar 3rd quarter earning report.Now to put the nail on my head here comes the 4th wave of Covid 19.Please be like Herbalife and be ""garage qualified"". Go to their store and buy something. Its all being tracked, and spike in store visit will result in a positive perception of the company. Look at Han Seng and iron ore commodity, its pretty much bottomed out."
No more shorting this stock. Up & away
Bought 20k @ 20.05 hopefully this has hit the bottom
It’s gonna gap up after ER. Then sell off and then it’ll start a long period of appreciation as sales boom and shorts close and go elsewhere
All signs this will be @ 26 or above by November . I’m calling it “November Rain”
So is Cramer shorting it now or?
The Gap is up 4.96% to 22.84
"This is some strange activity. When retail sales went up, Gap is holding steady or slightly down. What gives?"
Is there a supply chain problem here? Are they going to be able to get hoodies etc?
"Monday is the day to begin bull , next target is $33, and then $45"
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the GPS board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
This will be in mid 30’s by x-mas. I’m grateful to own GPS @ this price
This is a $30 earnings time!
We filled some of the GAP today...
"I will buy some shares. When the seller is done today, Monday is going to be a new day!"
"Wells Fargo downgraded the stock today , short term it looks like dead ."
"They drove the price down on ￼purpose, glad I didn’t take the bait , did the opposite and loaded up .Happy thoughts"
did not think this was gonna turn negative today
"16B revenue monster, the most undervalue stock on the market"
Kanye sweats already sold out. GPS shld already be 40$ not sure why such a big pullback from 30$$
Selling at $75
"just hold GPS shares and day trade some of it. Soon will skyrocket in the first week of November. Buy M, AAL and some Macys"
"Net sales for the Gap Inc. were $4.2 billion, the highest second-quarter sales in more than a decade. After the report Gap CEO comment that they entering 2 new markets, “Home” and “plus size” which is 330B market"
Only down $1 but that doesn't really say what I have lost. All my other holdings have gone up a lot so this has cost a lot more than one dollar down. Time to move on. Good luck to you holding.
I believe that Gaps management are top notch . I think Gaps started a business strategy in the very beginning of the pandemic to deal with shut downs and chain supply issues￼￼. We will see there management insight to look into the the future this holiday season. I’m very confident in their marketing team as well . MERRY Christmas to Katy Perry & Kanye west.￼
"Last week it was Well Fargo, this week its Citigroup. The hits keep on coming for GPS.CITI downgraded GPS from $32 to $25, with 75% success rate. Bummer to start the weekend.Open up your wallets, time to buy the dip."
December price target let’s get some positivity here I am calling for 26.34-27.93
High cotton prices causing this and other clothing companies to go down . Hold the stock for 6 months
10/27: The short interest has gone up higher now at 13.8%!Some mafia folks got a hit on GPS or something.This is like battling City Hall. You (i.e. me the little guy) just can't win.
Over 23 @ close tomorrow
I didn’t even know GPS had a home furnishing business. Anyone have a GAP couch or coffee table ?
Selling volume is weak and the buying volume strong - don't be fooled by a light day. When the market comes back to consumer discretionary this oversold stock will lift.
Will this ever hit 27 again?
"Might want to buy at this very low price , remember the holiday season is almost here.￼"
dude isnt this walmart partnership old news? why is it having this big of an impact?
Is this what they call: throwing the baby out with the bath water?? Retail apparel sold off today because they were highly inflated and it dragged reasonably valued companies with it. Don’t think the sector rotation out of retail apparel is over yet..
