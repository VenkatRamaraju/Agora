I am a little bit scared of holding. His market wants to drop everything. Gap might drop to 20 tomorrow but long term is a strong buy
Did anyone get their Yeezy's yet?
Apparently Universal released Kanye's album without his approval. Most likely due to his numerous delays. Gap should follow suit & release the yeezy collab without Kanye's approval otherwise we will probably waiting untill spring next year.
Tomorrow Gap will open i Say $29 or evern $30 Very good Earning and Outlook watch
Reversal starting very soon!
These recent creative collaborations incredibly increase GPS margins! More innovation programs upcoming in this back-to-school season!
EPS = $0.7 vs 0.43 (est)Sales = $4.21B vs $4.12B (est)cautionary note: sales beat is no that great.
"Sales must be fairly shrunk in near future due to massive global shop closing, but it will contribute to save expenditure and to get more profits."
What’s everyone opinion hold or sell before earnings? It can pop up tomorrow like footlocker
Amazing results. I should have bought more...
BYE BYE SHORTS
Gap will be 40 dollars in a month or less.
"Just ordered new chinos from banana rep. I’m sorry but this company is golden any talk otherwise is just noise. Buying GIS, GPS, KHC and SAVE."

I heard about GPS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Everyone is loading, did you see the 3 blocks of GAP bought a few minutes ago?"
Finally something green in my holdings
Buy and Hold
"10B Cap with 16B Revenue, more revenue than any 100B cap hype companies"
"Danny, why would you say you doubt buying 3000 shares ? Ive been doing this a long time and have made a lot of money, maybe you cant load 3000 shares but others can"
SMASHED EARNINGS
Imagine if they missed earnings and the market was down today.
I do think this is a long term investment. There are other good retail investments as well but this one is cheap. The others have already gone up in price. Shorts are pretty much screwed for the next few years if they stay here.
"so much enthusiam for gps, so little gain. Will gps end the day red?"
Kanye gone bring this brand mainstream
"boom, gonna pass 30 tmr. Earning beats and even stronger than Q2 2019 (pre-pandemic)"
$40 by end of the year
Earnings will be great due to athletes. That alone is worth the market cap of gap
I’m ready for the squeeze.
loaded 3000
TOMORROW BE A VERY NICE HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE U SEE
"Buying more now. If it opens at 8%, it has a chance to go to 20%. look at Macys, opened 8% and closed 20% up. Gap is stronger company than Macys."
anybody else think there should have been a much better reaction to earnings? I took a bigger position today because I loved what I heard from earnings but am I missing something?
Athleta alone will carry gap

Bullish for Gap loaded every dip and will continue to load every sale price
What’s everyone’s thoughts on this drapr acquisition? I wonder what they paid for it...

"30 soon , buy now"
