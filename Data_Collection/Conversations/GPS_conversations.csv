Will this ever hit 27 again?
Is this what they call: throwing the baby out with the bath water?? Retail apparel sold off today because they were highly inflated and it dragged reasonably valued companies with it. Don’t think the sector rotation out of retail apparel is over yet..
Rebound has started buy now
Athleta’s entry to Canada business will have a significant impact to next quarter results. Nothing reflected in stock price though.
Please! No more good news!!
No more shorting this stock. Up & away
Is there a supply chain problem here? Are they going to be able to get hoodies etc?
"Think long term 25,28,31,43,55"
Amazing results. I should have bought more...
Setting another buy order at $22.75. Hope it triggers. This is so undervalued right now.
"Last week it was Well Fargo, this week its Citigroup. The hits keep on coming for GPS.CITI downgraded GPS from $32 to $25, with 75% success rate. Bummer to start the weekend.Open up your wallets, time to buy the dip."
"Got 190 shares at 23.51. As long as schools stay open and restaurant and bars this will do well. Banana republic is getting a style overhaul, they killed the money suck “hill city” yeezy season for GAP and Athleta got into Canada."
"GPS to rally in September. Re-open trade, schools in session, nice fundamentals...$32 by EOM.Good luck Longs."
Where are at the consumer is very strong. My daughter friends love this retail chain. It seems like it is back in vogue regardless of the drop. Glta today I see what happens to my c and p sold I think it closes on 23 on the money
I am taking the bate 2300 at 23
Closing above the 20-day and on higher than average volume. Since corporate earnings have been so positive I imagine that shorts are starting to close their positions. Bloomberg noted today that Gap had a large increase in foot traffic and overall and sentiment is positive. This should get a lift in the next few weeks.
We filled some of the GAP today...
Buy order in for 200 shares tomorrow. Plan is to sell 500 shares to pay off for my car
anybody else think there should have been a much better reaction to earnings? I took a bigger position today because I loved what I heard from earnings but am I missing something?
CNBC so full of there selves
"Monday is the day to begin bull , next target is $33, and then $45"
Anything under 24 is a buy. You can trade a position but definitely buy a long term long position and enjoy the divs until it hits 40
i feel like this company is insanly undervalued currently
this stock can never keep momentum!
When is the dividend up we go
Athleta alone will carry gap
"Adding more of this one. In a couple of months, this could be at new 52-week high."
Prepare for launch
"They drove the price down on ￼purpose, glad I didn’t take the bait , did the opposite and loaded up .Happy thoughts"
Weekly chart getting close to turn if it turns in the next 3-4 weeks we might get a real nice run.
Please no more good news and this might go up a little
"Get ready for reversal, pile up or average down. Insider option activity has solid bullish sentiment"
Stock desperately needs to cross its 20-day moving average
"Sales must be fairly shrunk in near future due to massive global shop closing, but it will contribute to save expenditure and to get more profits."
Stock price has gotten through two super earnings. How's next?
Market is in the deep red today and gap in the green .
Bought 400 shares here sold the 24 calls
About 8 business days to dividend. Bo yasaaa.
Divine intervention for April the better month for retail my calls should expire soon.
High cotton prices causing this and other clothing companies to go down . Hold the stock for 6 months
Investors coming in huge
Kanye gone bring this brand mainstream
Old people just don’t know the significance. Gap to 100
we got katy perry now? lets go
December price target let’s get some positivity here I am calling for 26.34-27.93
Ready to pop
WHO IS SELLING?!?!?!? I NEED TO KNOW
yeezy gap drops in 11 hours? Gap stores in france were sold? holy bull. ITS BULL SEASON!!!
I don’t think this can trade higher than 27 this year until the eddy the Bear hibernates so in March we should be back on our feet and covid hibernates also
I didn’t even know GPS had a home furnishing business. Anyone have a GAP couch or coffee table ?
Selling volume is weak and the buying volume strong - don't be fooled by a light day. When the market comes back to consumer discretionary this oversold stock will lift.
"If LEVI reports strong ER tomorrow, this could get an additional boost."
What happened the stock went up so nice and fell ? Any bad news or just market overall reaction ?
"This stock is being held down , that means it will go up nicely when it wants to. Fall & early winter this be in the mid 30’s so buy now a wait please, GPS TRIBE"

Added 560 shares sold 24 calls
Run to 50 dma 26.79 area is my guess near term
Nothing can stop yeezy
"Net sales for the Gap Inc. were $4.2 billion, the highest second-quarter sales in more than a decade. After the report Gap CEO comment that they entering 2 new markets, “Home” and “plus size” which is 330B market"
Target 27.84 end of year.2022 target 31.75
This should go up $1 tomorrow and eventually $30 before the quarter.Vietnam issues are overblown
How cheap do they want this thing???
"So if Abercombe and fitch is worth $36, then gap must be worth $60, by far lot more market share internationally, don't believe all the bull about supply shortages. Theirs a lot of container ships parked off the cost of California. NO SUPPLY SHORTAGE JUST DELAY IN GETTING THE SHIPS EMPTIED,"
Imagine if they missed earnings and the market was down today.
classic retail dropping before close
Gap when are you going to release the Kanye jackets you sold for fake revenue numbers
woah nice little volume spike there at the end
"Might want to buy at this very low price , remember the holiday season is almost here.￼"
Huge wall @ 23
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
Stock looks very attractive based on fundamentals and reopening tailwind. Institutions shorted the stock to this level. I don’t see any selling from institutions after yesterday’s morning session. Total profited shares percentage now is 3.78%. Don’t expect anymore shorting in this stock. Expect 28$ soon.
Yeezy is way bigger and badder than 1 gender or 1 race or 1 whatever….Yeezy is bold and affordable for the masses in Gap world. Imagine the youthful draw to The Gap by working with KW.Yeezy is a gold bar. Imagine the on line sales the Yeezy brand delivers for GPS investors. Only way I know for a mere mortal to invest with a human ATM machine.
"Bounce back starting ,bought more .Time to load up now green light"
Apparently Universal released Kanye's album without his approval. Most likely due to his numerous delays. Gap should follow suit & release the yeezy collab without Kanye's approval otherwise we will probably waiting untill spring next year.
When shorts starts taking their profits this will go back up to 30ish.. hold!!
"I’m sure they’ll drive this down any chance that they can . Especially before earnings , that just fine with me .I’ll be waiting and watching closely"
Buy and Hold
$GPS is beyond oversold down here. I'm loading heavy on Monday.
The Rebublican party are stonewalling
let's hope it continues to rise!
Bottoming Wednesday if we drop I will add 10 shares on open and 10syies during the day.
yeezy coming soon rumors
"Potential target of WSB, also, don’t forget Ye saved Nike, then Adidas, Gaps will be the next"
Just loaded the boat...GL Longs
"great, the % of shorts increased to 9% overnight."
"Big news for Athleta and REI...from 5 stores to 135 stores. MM’s still at work for cheap shares, nothing more. You’ll be glad that you own GPS within the next 2 months."
"just hold GPS shares and day trade some of it. Soon will skyrocket in the first week of November. Buy M, AAL and some Macys"
Volume is increasing slowlyGrab ur last chance and then we will go on ride its not gonna stop trust meGood company with awesome earning and management!!!
"Still consolidating, which way will this go?￼"
"Added more this AM, will add more on dips."
This will be in mid 30’s by x-mas. I’m grateful to own GPS @ this price
"go ahead, give me the bear argument,"
"Not too bad -.28. Getting kind of used to this stock, just took me a little while. Could have been worse... set the bar low and you will not be disappointed."
With there guidance raised by the company from 1.90-2.10 this is trading at 12 pe the industry is 17.I think this is where they get the 33-38 a share
"lol ... Macy's, f4 cked both the gap and the nordstrom ... such a huge growth in such a short time ... the managers eat their bread for a reason"
"Love to see GPS only uses 1 year to build up such a diverse spot-on fashion ecosystem!  Thanks to AEO’s earnings report failure, we can load up GPS at such a rare beautiful dip!"
"Launch time, very green on a red market day"
"When you see anf and aro and ges performing better than gps, you know the manipulation is strong"
Reversal will happen. Just be patient. You won’t want to miss it.
"It seems the whole market is slowly falling apart, most of my low Risk stocks have crumbled by 15% or more , in the last month or so . Beware or every Bull will be broke soon ."
Strength in a “red” market. $25+ by end of week is possible.
Jen m bby aeo anf and GPS slowly moving up
Only down $1 but that doesn't really say what I have lost. All my other holdings have gone up a lot so this has cost a lot more than one dollar down. Time to move on. Good luck to you holding.
"Stocks fluctuate, nothing has changed still great company, holding into Christmas season at minimum, we will have a bull run sooner or later"
plz dont sell off at the end of the day like usual!! please!!!
"8B market cap with 20B revenue, holidays season end of the month, gap most sell is on winter collections"
Kohl's downgrade. BBBY big drop. That means GPS gets to tank. What a crock.
"Buying more now. If it opens at 8%, it has a chance to go to 20%. look at Macys, opened 8% and closed 20% up. Gap is stronger company than Macys."
It’s seems that if you’re willing to stick your neck out and bet that the supply chain issues get resolved and that the economy holds up you could probably make decent money on stocks like GPS if you’re right
10/27: The short interest has gone up higher now at 13.8%!Some mafia folks got a hit on GPS or something.This is like battling City Hall. You (i.e. me the little guy) just can't win.
"GAP going to $ 28 EOD, premarket looks good !"
End of day buying for me. 200 shares hopefully cheaper
"Gap looking strong = strength, buy now reversal is here to stay"
did not think this was gonna turn negative today
"Retesting 22.51 , then up from there. Happy thoughts"
What’s everyone’s thoughts on this drapr acquisition? I wonder what they paid for it...
sigh* when will they turn it around? this valuation is so cheap
I am SICK of buying the DIP on this STOCK. WHAT is GOING ON
We can see $38 again next earning mix with holidays and winter season
the time is now. the rally is alive. GAP is forever.
"Can’t believe this low price, buying more when I can"
"Ok reversal definitely here, read my posts & learn . Do your research & $$make money in the Market , so again buy now or $$regret$$"
Sold 20 24 puts for this week and 30 24 calls
Anyone think this will hit $30 this year?
Who is pounding this so hard?
Getting balenciaga vibes from the yeezy jacket. I can see the entire upper East side copping one just to be in-trend but still well styled. I hope Kanye keeps dropping stuff like this
Yeezy season.
So is Cramer shorting it now or?
Dividend countdown
Picked up 30 at 24.48
I believe that Gaps management are top notch . I think Gaps started a business strategy in the very beginning of the pandemic to deal with shut downs and chain supply issues￼￼. We will see there management insight to look into the the future this holiday season. I’m very confident in their marketing team as well . MERRY Christmas to Katy Perry & Kanye west.￼
Selling at $75
What happens when they bump back up divy payout???
dude isnt this walmart partnership old news? why is it having this big of an impact?
is anybody else really confused with this stocks recent performance? they posted an amazing quarter? Any thoughts? bull or bearish?
They had some interesting insights about GPS on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"LEVI killed there earnings, if Gap doesnt shoot up tomorow then im buying as many share as I can"
Money leaving hi flyers should help support this stock to the mid 27s pretty soon dividend countdown !!!!!
Strong buy $45 price Target 
The Gap is up 4.96% to 22.84
I’m back in. Sub-$23 seemed way too irresistible.
I’m ready for the squeeze.
Well let’s see if it closes up or below 24. Either way I have some for the pop
"I will buy some shares. When the seller is done today, Monday is going to be a new day!"
I will be selling outs on Wednesday or Thursday I live Gap
let the battle begin!Shorts got almost 14% stake on the free floating shares.
What’s everyone opinion hold or sell before earnings? It can pop up tomorrow like footlocker
"This is some strange activity. When retail sales went up, Gap is holding steady or slightly down. What gives?"
Finally something green in my holdings
"Wells Fargo downgraded the stock today , short term it looks like dead ."
"Nice volume building going back , will close in the 24’s for sure buy now"
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the GPS board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
Looks like a new pattern forming since Friday morning.
This is a $30 earnings time!
Fade and basing here. Very good sign. All my positions are covered miss the upside but towards the div I think it traded very well
Remember Investment Manager Fees calculated against net asset value the last day of September for the qtr. higher assets they get more commission
Bought 1500 shares here .28
Picked 600 today holding more than yesterday sold 6 24 calls for Friday and sold 5 23 outs for same
LULU’s ER should help GPS if it’s a good one.
Kanye sweats already sold out. GPS shld already be 40$ not sure why such a big pullback from 30$$
"I’m adding on dips from here on out. The pattern reversal is in, and the 6 month chart says BUY."
All signs this will be @ 26 or above by November . I’m calling it “November Rain”
EPS = $0.7 vs 0.43 (est)Sales = $4.21B vs $4.12B (est)cautionary note: sales beat is no that great.
One of the only stocks that is green today
Watching the AH
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Gap will be soaring soon ,even before earning which are going to be incredible . Buy now!"
TOMORROW BE A VERY NICE HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE U SEE
"Now watch some crazy reversal going on, expect EOD close + 4%"
Cramer said on Mad Money last night that $GPS GAP is cheap and a good buy opportunity. I agree!
Bought 20k @ 20.05 hopefully this has hit the bottom
The scariest 6-month chart!
Picked 200 on close sold the 25 calls
Think buy now
Looking at the chart again 15-20 per add today
Have only held this a little over a week and will dump soon if this continues to drop.
I think this valuation is nuts
Yeezy Gap aint even drop yet
"10/11 Monday morning Bummer: nominal GDP of USA is being revised LOWER to around 4% for 2021 and first half of 2022. Its all a guess work, but the red flags are propping up. Lower than expected unemployment report, value of dollar receding, oil and inflation up. All of these factors will have an impact on consumer purchasing power. This impacts consumer cyclical market stocks. I realize Levis, had stellar 3rd quarter earning report.Now to put the nail on my head here comes the 4th wave of Covid 19.Please be like Herbalife and be ""garage qualified"". Go to their store and buy something. Its all being tracked, and spike in store visit will result in a positive perception of the company. Look at Han Seng and iron ore commodity, its pretty much bottomed out."
Yeezy yeezy yeezy just bought a crib in Belgium… yeezy yeezy yeezy I feel so accomplished !
Over 23 @ close tomorrow
Here we go!!!
Not sure who would be selling this after LEVI’s great ER.
It’s gonna gap up after ER. Then sell off and then it’ll start a long period of appreciation as sales boom and shorts close and go elsewhere
Buy order set 23.2 23 22.7 22.4 22. 21.6 21.3 21 20.5 2019.9I but 100 buy orders in for the listed and selling 2 puts for strikes down to 23-22 this week and 15 at 21 ish. Again Thz Walk street
Seems like gap has got supply chain weaknesses too.. the yzy merch restock looks almost nonexistent
Added a little more here in the $22’s.Interested to hear from LEVI after the bell.
Hold.. shorters gonna short but long we hold!!
"Very good news coming out soon , big investors will start buying"
I heard about GPS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"boom, gonna pass 30 tmr. Earning beats and even stronger than Q2 2019 (pre-pandemic)"
Picked up 500 24.26
Dividend count down
Chart looks like it could turn soon 9000 shares
The sale on GPS continues. I’ll be adding more.
"Typical poor performance in the retail sector for September. Loaded up at the discount, will hit a turnaround point soon and outperform come October. This company has been doing everything right lately"

Good news this stock is finally showing strength
"$JWN really needs to focus on the inventory aspect. It’s a highlight of their business. Of course you can’t reach 2019 levels with all of the delays in manufacturing and shipping, unless you have excess inventory like $GPS and $M had. What’ll make this jump is reinstating the dividend and/or announcing buybacks. Which will happen at some point. $JWN is becoming a lean, mean; cash machine. After we have clarity on what the post pandemic world will look like, the sky’s the limit for JWN."
"16B revenue monster, the most undervalue stock on the market"
