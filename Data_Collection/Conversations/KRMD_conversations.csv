Will this get past $12.00 again?
Just I bought 10K shares...GREENNN
Let’s hope we see some significant insider buying to show their faith in the new interim CEO and company’s prospects.
"Q4 2020 Financial ResultsNet sales were $4.1 million for Q4 2020, a 34.8% decrease from $6.2 million in Q4 2019. Net sales were down primarily due to inventory in the channel from the precautionary buying related to COVID-19 in the first half of the year and the large early order placed in the third quarter of 2020, as well as lower international sales and novel therapies sales, which currently includes clinical trial sales. Higher allowances also contributed to lower net sales in the quarter."
some news come out earlier? This thing is flying.
"On 10/3,Joe Manko, the largest shareholder bought 25,000 shares with an average fill price of $7.26On 10/2,Joe Manko bought 6,500 shares with an average fill price of $7.46There is no denying that some of the headlines around the last quarters earnings were negative, being miss-characterized as ""a miss"". The last earnings numbers included a one time non cash payment to settle the expensive ongoing legal battle with EMED.The company's record top line sales of $7.7 million, up from $5.34 million YOY reflects the company's ability to execute. This is where the headlines should have focused. Also this is the reason the analysts are holding price targets of $13/share or higher.Joe Mankos purchases say to me that the company company is doing well and at this price is a good investment."
"It's good they chose a woman that seems to have been in charge of a company like Becton Dickinson. Interesting how so many women in business remain with the ""Ms."" title. There are exceptions like Nancy pelosi, who is destroying the USA and El Salvador, but permitting unrestrained immigration of 2/3 of El Salvador to the US. All that US dollars will leave the USA and be sent to El Salvador to help their families. Even the President of El Salvador is concerned about the loss due to immigration"
"Well gosh... that kinda stinks! After last quarter's one time charge, I stuck around until this quarter, hoping for strong numbers. Guess little ole KRMD just can't put it all together.Sometimes you fish, and sometimes you cut bait. Time for me to cut bait. There are better growth stories out there. Good luck for those sticking around."
$KRMD is a great choice for investing at this time. What a great stock.
"I only had cash available to purchase a few thousand. trying to sell stocks that I really don't want to , but these prices are too good."
Ive got an order in for a chunk... lets see if it fills at $4 even
I am doing good considering I tried to sell this and it didn't get executed for some reason at $4.
"why is this company worth 9$ ?? the total revenue is 25 million $, profit margin in the industry is 12%, that gives 0.06 cent EPS, is that worth 9$ ? or even 5$ ??"
Any reason for the sharp rise today?
"Spoke with sales department, SWAMPED with orders for Freedom60 Syringe Infusion System and Precision Flow Rate Tubing are in HIGH demand as U.S. hospitals and International clinical facilities ramp up for COVID-19 patients. Lead times of 4 weeks is being reduced to 2 weeks due to demand. Upstate NY manufactures scrambling to meet demand."
I believe it went up today because last night Louis Navellier sent out a this stock recomendation as his breakout stock for 2020. he thinks it can go up 500% or more in a few years.
another new all time high was hit today on good volume.
"The impact of the covid-19 on KRMD is not fully understood by the investment community. KRMD stays open because its work is considered essential and will continue to produce product as planned,. Concerns surrounding treating PIDD patient in hospitals and doctors offices will accelerate the movement to home infusion."
stock price is up 12/1 per insider buying on https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2020/12/01/insider-buying-repro-med-systems-inc-nasdaqkrmd-chairman-purchases-21052-shares-of-stock.html
"sell it now, this stock is not worth 2$ even"
sorry man took my earnings and will be back later
Just got upgraded by yahoo finance with PT 10$ time to buy bulls!
"If the stock price can close above $2 for 90 consecutive days then the stock is can be up listed to a major exchange,"
Any reason the sharp upward after hours trade today?
"for the short term/swing traders among you: where march and April horrible for you, or did you make money ? $KRMD"
"RMS Medical Products Receives Favorable Court Ruling CHESTER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Repro Med Systems, Inc. dba RMS Medical Products (OTCQX: REPR) (“RMS Medical” or “the Company”) today announced that on June 24, 2019 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Case No. 2:15-CV-01167-JRG-RSP) issued a decision recommending that RMS Medical’s motion for summary judgement of non-infringement against EMED Technologies (“EMED”) be granted and that the case before it be dismissed. As previously reported, on June 25, 2015 EMED filed a case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas claiming patent infringement on one of its patents by the Company’s needle sets and seeking unspecified monetary damages. This case is one of several pending between RMS Medical and EMED. On June 26, 2019, EMED filed objections to the decision. The decision of the Magistrate Judge serving in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, EMED’s objections and associated documents will be reviewed by the District Judge. RMS Medical believes it will prevail on the merits and the District Judge will uphold the decision of the Magistrate Judge and dismiss the case, although there can be no assurances."
"I had some money from an IRa contribution, so I bought some more"
"OK Repro, I took a long position yesterday.....Make me proud."
Conspiracy theories have become the default position in America. Maybe the CEO was fired for not performing up to expectations rather than some nefarious unknown misdeeds. Let's see how the fundamentals go from here.
"there is a ton of insider buying a few weeks ago . Search ""sec KRMD"""
Lost more than 1/2 of my investment in krmd.Willing to get out if my loss would be increased by 1/3.
"I am planning on buying shares at some point. I think the leadership team is strong and they seem to have a great position in the market. Not sure when. I will wait. Maybe I don't ever buy. My view is this: CEO probably resigned for expectations not being met IMO(Maybe they thought it would just be sales after sales or also disappointed by results during COVID(Over blown on this issue. Why: these people aren't going to the hospital or health care system). I think this stock could go as low as under $2 dollars. IMO 20% yearly growth for awhile, but the market might price in the current expected growth or almost no growth based off last year. This the catalyst for it to go below 2. It is fair value currently expecting 20% growth, but I am not sure the market will see it that way which is why I am holding off."
"On the bright side, if you strip out the one-time litigation expense, KRMD actually earned $.03/share which is an earnings beat of 50%. Guess I'll stick around for another 3 months!"
"This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -200%.Revenues are expected to be $5 million, down 21% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 100% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period."
I should have sold half (2000 shares) into the strength at the close! Here's hoping for good numbers and good guidance!!
"trailr1 second agoCraig-Hallum, which initiated coverage of the company in the spring, has a $5.50/share price. When RMS uplists on the 17th look for money to start coming into the stock"
Did the market sell on the news of because of the news? Q$ numbers were disappointing. No doubt about that. Manangement softened the hit by pointing out that some orders were delayed until January and that the quarter included some one time hits. To focus on Q4 numbers is to see the trees and not the forest. The company has laid out a very aggressive growth plan with management incentives based on executing the plan. The management believes that subcutaneous injections are in the early stage of adoptions for new applications(PIDD and CIPD). Existing drugs are being reformulated for subcutaneous injections. It minimizes lost work time for patient and primary care taker of patients.
Just curious why the huge drop What was so bad about the report ??
Sold out 41k shares today Something smells fishy here
I wonder where this stock will be in 10 years. I will be retired involuntarily :)
"RMS Medical Products initiated with a Buy at Craig-Hallum Craig-Hallum analyst Alexander Nowak started RMS Medical Products with a Buy rating and $5.50 price target. With a trend toward in-home infusion, an overabundance of drugs moving to subQ and a company now focused on the pump partnership opportunity, the analyst believes RMS could ultimately become a much larger medical device supplier.I suspect additional analysts will follow."
"where is this going next couple months? x2 or x3 Lol, i am waiting for their 2021 full year guidance hopefully they can shine a little, but it is definitely a long hold, it is tough to really time the market when it goes down or higher....."

What's going on today? Seems to have stalled a bit!Any ideas?
within a curly hair of 1....and all the commenters are gone ?
scam
super 26 needle set gets fda approval. This is a big deal because the design of the super 26 provides a higher flow rate through a smaller needle. Smaller needle size means less discomfort for the patient.
The company is receiving a tremendous number of new orders. This is the understated part of the conference call. To meet this demand KRMD added a second shift. KRMD is borrowing money to buy new production. equipment. Look at the accounts payable. The company is increasing inventory to meet future demand.
Why is this going down...This has been a Bull...I buy in... down she goes...
two bullish signals 1) insider buying at 7.22) under the 200 day moving average - close to low or near it.

"Repro Med Systems, Inc. (KRMD) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2021. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."

It's a shame they only got $1.20 for their shares MTNB 
no news and -8%?..that sounds like nice entry point
Gileads.Covid19 drug is seen as the likely the best therapeutic treatment. It is infused....That looks good for KRMD
1st year target on yahoo raised from $10 to $11.25. fake news?
So why is there two names for the company? Repro or KORU? how bout pick one and go with it?
I’m in at $5.76. My research is showing that $9.50 is a fair and achievable price.
"Oh well, so I missed my chance. Let's see what they have to say on the conference call."
New news???
Looks like good opportunity here.
Charts up with some profits as well. Impressive
I see tremendous upside here

"Apellis' Soliris rival Empaveli snags FDA approval in PNHby Noah Higgins-Dunn | May 14, 2021 5:15pmMore than a year after Apellis Pharmaceuticals proved its C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan could go head-to-head with industry heavyweight Soliris in patients with the rare blood disorder paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), the biotech is finally getting its shot at the market. The FDA on Friday approved Apellis' subcutaneous pegcetacoplan, marketed as Empaveli, for the treatment of adults with PNH. The disease is a rare, chronic blood disorder characterized by the destruction of healthy, oxygen-carrying red blood cells both inside and outside the blood vessels, known as hemolysis. The destruction is driven by an uncontrolled immune system and defective bone marrow not making enough blood components. Apellis’ C3 therapy, which targets a different enzyme than Alexion's C5 inhibitors, is designed to regulate that excessive immune response."

"The increased inventory says the company is preparing for and believes that strong internal growth will continue. It is seeking reimbursement for legal and court costs. I suspect this is a bargaining chip to help settle the last lawsuit. But I believe that KRMD will get some reimbursement. The CC talked of the new chairman of the board, John Fletcher. He is highly regarded, with a ton of experience and will help maximize shareholder value,"
We should all do what GameStop did!!
On Friday RMS filed a security registration. The registration allows shares purchased @ $1.20/share in the December private placement to be traded. Previously the shares were restricted. The buyers from the private placement are looking to double or triple there investment. Just my opinion - do your own DD and make your own informed investment choices.
Someone spent $1M on 102K shares this morning. That's lots of money.
"There is no justifiable reason for this stock to be trading so high. At $19MM in total revenue TTM, REPR is trading at 7.5x current revenue and would need to grow to ~$50MM in 2-3 years to support today's price. The company has not been able to expand its global business, has not introduced any relevant new products, and continues to lag behind others in their segment. This is definitely a stock to sell now before the price dips."
2.00 in next 30 days

"Q1 earnings to be released Tuesday after market closes with CC the following day before market opens. Stock seems to be trending up on good volume prior to earnings. Same thing happened last quarter and investors were disappointed. This quarter will be different. The one time expenses of last quarter are behind us. Some fourth quarter sales were delayed until this quarter. Look for 20% YOY top line growth, Bottom line looks like a return to profitability. First quarter with new management team at the wheel. This is the first, very early peek at how they are doing.I am crossing my fingers and expecting better things down the line."
"I sold my whole small/medium position today at a very tiny loss, here’s why... I think earnings on March 23 are going to be horrible... I think revenues are dropping sequentially from Qtr to Qtr and something’s not right if that’s the case.

"Interesting to see the trend towards subcutaneous administration of certain therapeutics from prior IV administration. As an example, Daratumumab has an IV infusion time measured in hours. However, clinical studies have recently shown equal efficacy with a subcutaneous delivery within minutes....see below.New Subcutaneous Daratumumab Formulation Overcomes Infusion Barrier for PatientsMonday, June 3, 2019Daratumumab-based regimens have shown efficacy across all lines of therapy in multiple myeloma (MM), but the agent requires a long intravenous infusion time, lasting from three to seven hours.

lot of things have changed here since last post. Stock way over one and hit a high of $1.80. Why? New management team and strengthening of the board of directors. Andy is out. RMS medical is now being run like a real company that is focused on executing and increasing shareholder value. Revenue growing at 15% or better year over year.

"KRMD currently has 80% market share of the PIDD subcutaneous market, RemarkableKRMD is a medical device company that has a razor/razorblade model that enables patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (""PIDD"") to self-administer plasma-derived treatments through subcutaneous infusion. There are roughly 270,000 people with PIDD in the U.S., but only ~70,000 (36%) are currently being treated. The primary reason for this large gap is that PIDD is difficult to diagnose, but awareness has been increasing. As a result, while the population with the disease is growing ~2% per year, the percentage of patients treated is growing closer to 10% per year. However, the story gets better for KRMD. Of the 70,000 patients currently being treated for PIDD, nearly 2/3 of those patients are being treated through intravenous therapy typically with one large dose per month in either a hospital or specialty clinic. This is suboptimal in several ways: it is inconvenient for the customer who has to go to the clinic and then receive a large dose through an IV, it is a high dose of a drug administered all at once (many patients feel sick afterwards and the effectiveness of the drug drops off significantly after a few weeks), and finally, it is very expensive for the healthcare industry since a dedicated facility and nurse are required.This is where KRMD's solution enters the picture. KRMD's subcutaneous infusion pump allows the patient to self-administer therapy at home, typically in smaller doses about once per week. The company currently has ~80% market share of the PIDD subcutaneous market - a market that is growing double digits and offers stable, recurring revenue. KRMD is in a different part of the plasma supply chain, but nonetheless benefits from double-digit secular growth in patient count. The company is undervalued based on its current PIDD and CIPD indications due to 20%+ sustainable revenue growth, 70% gross margins, and significant operating leverage. Moreover, there is a chance that the current management team and board, which is impressive for a micro-cap, can create value by extending the use of its pumps for other emerging subcutaneous drugs, the stock could have multiples of upside from current levels.GO KRMD"
reminder that earnings came out yesterday and a CC is being hosted this morning.

The Company’s common stock will continue to trade on the OTCQX until market close on October 16, 2019."
2x coming I feel it
somehow I manage to buy stocks from companies that are being sued by lawyers. CEO must be guilty of something if he resigned and then a lawsuit was filed.
going up on expectations of Aug 05 earnings report?
Canacord rec. with $13.00 target. That's will be just a start if they sign on more drug companies for their pumps.
"I need good, no, GREAT earnings from KRMD. Let's go Baby!!!"
tomorrow should be a good day for this stock if the monday financial report is solid.
I diversified stocks before. This time I sold one that did nothing and bought 5000 shares more of KRMD. so what if it's going down in price. Insiders bought it at $7 and it's well below 200 day moving average. People giving it away at $6.10
retail buyers coming in. Look for positive pre- earnings announcement shortly
REPR longs unfortunately are riding on the wrong horse.MTNB 
Great few weeks for KRMD. Grifols Xemblify drug has begun to ship. Craig Hallum analysts says between Xemblify and Hizentra KRMD should reach their $50 million revenue goal for 2022. This includes zero upside from any other ew indications between now and then. Cheers to all longs!!
