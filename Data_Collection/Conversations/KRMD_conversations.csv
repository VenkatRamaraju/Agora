Just I bought 10K shares...GREENNN
Analysts rose rates to strong buy
"The increased inventory says the company is preparing for and believes that strong internal growth will continue. It is seeking reimbursement for legal and court costs. I suspect this is a bargaining chip to help settle the last lawsuit. But I believe that KRMD will get some reimbursement. The CC talked of the new chairman of the board, John Fletcher. He is highly regarded, with a ton of experience and will help maximize shareholder value,"
So why is there two names for the company? Repro or KORU? how bout pick one and go with it?
Good Q1 2020 results. What’s people’s thoughts?
The ceo resigned thats your insight on the future of the company
within a curly hair of 1....and all the commenters are gone ?
why does this stock page say this stock is overvalued? https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KRMD?p=KRMD that isn't correct. Is it undervalued.
I suppose I will have to get some more of this. This price is panic selling too low.
"OK Repro, I took a long position yesterday.....Make me proud."
super 26 needle set gets fda approval. This is a big deal because the design of the super 26 provides a higher flow rate through a smaller needle. Smaller needle size means less discomfort for the patient.

Why is the stock down again??
"Repr has been in business long, saves lives, and it profitable. Good stock to keep."
We should all do what GameStop did!!
27.3M$ in cash
Loaded up another 400 @4.40
"Q1 earnings to be released Tuesday after market closes with CC the following day before market opens. Stock seems to be trending up on good volume prior to earnings. Same thing happened last quarter and investors were disappointed. This quarter will be different. The one time expenses of last quarter are behind us. Some fourth quarter sales were delayed until this quarter. Look for 20% YOY top line growth, Bottom line looks like a return to profitability. First quarter with new management team at the wheel. This is the first, very early peek at how they are doing.I am crossing my fingers and expecting better things down the line."
why there isn't anual report yet??
"Repro Med Systems, Inc. dba RMS Medical Products (OTCQX: REPR) today announced that Dan Goldberger, Executive Chairman, will be presenting at the 29th Annual Oppenheimer Healthcare Conference in New York, NY on Tuesday, March 19th."
I see tremendous upside here
I believe it went up today because last night Louis Navellier sent out a this stock recomendation as his breakout stock for 2020. he thinks it can go up 500% or more in a few years.
Nice day to buy
"RMS Medical Products initiated with a Buy at Craig-Hallum Craig-Hallum analyst Alexander Nowak started RMS Medical Products with a Buy rating and $5.50 price target. With a trend toward in-home infusion, an overabundance of drugs moving to subQ and a company now focused on the pump partnership opportunity, the analyst believes RMS could ultimately become a much larger medical device supplier.I suspect additional analysts will follow."
"There is no justifiable reason for this stock to be trading so high. At $19MM in total revenue TTM, REPR is trading at 7.5x current revenue and would need to grow to ~$50MM in 2-3 years to support today's price. The company has not been able to expand its global business, has not introduced any relevant new products, and continues to lag behind others in their segment. This is definitely a stock to sell now before the price dips."
" This is a very Bullish Chart, traders! https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts"
"KRMD to be added to the Russell index as of Friday, the 26th. This means all those ETFs that follow the Russell indices have to include KRMD in their portfolios. Look for increased volume over the next to weeks as buying increases. This usually translates into a 10% increase in share price, just more good news for us longs!!"
I’m in at $5.76. My research is showing that $9.50 is a fair and achievable price.
The company is receiving a tremendous number of new orders. This is the understated part of the conference call. To meet this demand KRMD added a second shift. KRMD is borrowing money to buy new production. equipment. Look at the accounts payable. The company is increasing inventory to meet future demand.
"https://ir.rmsmedicalproducts.com/press-releases/detail/40/district-judge-issues-final-judgment-in-favor-of-rmsCHESTER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Repro Med Systems, Inc. dba RMS Medical Products (OTCQX: REPR) (“RMS Medical” or “the Company”) today announced that on June 28, 2019 the United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas (Case No. 2:15-CV-01167-JRG-RSP) issued a Final Judgment in favor of RMS Medical in the Company’s previously announced litigation with EMED Technologies (“EMED”) before that court. The District Judge adopted the decision of the Magistrate Judge that was issued on June 24, 2019, overruled EMED’s objections, awarded court costs to RMS Medical, and dismissed the case. This case was one of several pending between RMS Medical and EMED.I hope this is the beginning of the end of litigation between the two companies. For RMS medical the litigation has been an expensive diversion of money and focus. Note that RMS will get reimbursed court costs. This should be an inducement for emed to settle any additional cases."
Lost more than 1/2 of my investment in krmd.Willing to get out if my loss would be increased by 1/3.
