Wont matter if kids go in..or stay home..we are coming into the heaviest part of a yearly market ..concerning educational material.. Load. Because its going back up..bank on it
Could be $5 tomorrow.
I'm not selling for anything less than $3.
pre-market ER conference bodes well for HMHC
Clark County School District is 5th largest school district in US. https://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/ccsd-staff-to-recommend-full-time-distance-education-in-tuesday-meeting/article_901a8426-cad5-11ea-a076-7776e3e6fb87.html
"41M students assigned to their online program called Ed as of June 2020. HMH Anywhere charges a $50 annual fee per student that includes teacher licenses for free and Teacher's Corner also included for free. $50 x 41M students = $2B of subscription fees per year for HMH Anywhere and Teacher's Corner. LRN's annual revenue is a little over $1B, their market cap is $1.73B. HMHC's market cap is $284M. If you equalize their market caps with the $2B of potential revenue from HMH Anywhere, then HMHC's share price would be $13.77. Keep in mind they also have the HMH Books and Media business that avg $200M in annual revenues.HMHC are cutting their entire workforce by 18% this quarter."
The pandemic has forced HMH to be a leaner and meaner company focused much more on digital tech. SCHL managed to beat on EPS by cutting costs aggressively. HMH is doing the same thing. This will be over $3 after earnings.
"HMHC has international support, online learning will soar in the next 4 weeks, easy money IMO."
The country will remain in total chaos until the election and then for several months after that. Bottom line is no one will be going back to work including teachers. School starts in 5 weeks and plans must be completed for remote learning programs in the next 3 weeks. This stock will benefit massively from the digital subscriptions on top of the text books which are still needed! It's a win win win!
If u sell cheap the. U lose Don’t cry wen u see the stock go up
"Someone explain this... the average EPS expectation of $0.53 is about same as actual EPS from a year ago of $0.55. However, the stock price is right below 50% of the price from previous earning. Shouldn't this at least double over next few days especially with the planned digital growth?"
"Just ordered 2k more shares , get it while you can"
"I’m in both,HMHC and BOXL...watch for BOXL it’s going to be back in the green along side of HMHC!!"
Wish I could buy more at this price. This is going over $3 again in by end of week
"CEO having a company wide ""Celebration Call"" in 20 min. to congrat and thank the company for the work and sacrifice over the past 5 months. Salaries went back to 100% for all from everyone taking 20% cut. (That was announced 2 weeks ago)---Having this type of call, 20 hours before earnings call'....is a good sign. I'm getting a better feel on my decision to HOLD and not sell late today. I'll come back w reaction."
New to this stock what is it that i need to know? Tryna make that BIG BAG 
My reaction is no reaction. Not sure even with this move that stock will go anywhere at this time. It is to early to tell. Just my opinion.
Where is that brilliant WF Analyst?
6$ coming 100%
How low can she go?
Everyone will catch on soon
Earnings weren't that bad. Don't get the large drop.
Another red day shocking!
Risk reward looks great ...
School's in. I brought my pencil...
You can see the smart big money entering! Awesome
"Dis look bad, but great for HMHC!https://www.wsj.com/articles/georgia-school-district-quarantines-800-people-amid-covid-outbreak-11597157377"
"Good buy, probably 2.4 easily in the hour"
"This has gone from $3.65 after hours yesterday to $2.60 already today. A lot of the PR that brought the share price up was corruptly produced and the company has confirmed that, see the Reuters article. Market makers will take this to $2 today."
PA schools choose HMC
> $3 next week
Dip before the march to 3.5
"As economies take a huge hit, virtual education will cut the educational costs of maintaining schools and other related expenses like busing. We need to streamline our societal expenses. As a world we need to live more efficiently."
Why would their 2020 sales be 50% of 2019? The move to digital should be greater under a school from home environment....
News that schools in Columbus will use hmhc platform for online learning
"Bill Gates recently stated that schools should stay closed for another year, hence virtual education will be the next logical step in our societal evolution. Brick and mortar schools may exist only at a fraction of the size providing room for new educational business development. There would probably billions saved in building maintenance costs not to mention busing and the pollution it creates. Finally, if the student and family was diligent enough they could harness the extra on-task time they would gain from travel time to and from school. We should try, as more pandemics will probably occur."
how high is it going to go
Thank god. Approaching the golden cross!!!!!! I ain't sellling. Thank god I DCAed at 1.6x.

State providing $5.3 billion in education support for the fall. “For distanced learning”
I just enjoy how negative people get when things go down. The company is creating a strong online business with probably the best contact list you could have.
Hello there baby !
"Just thought I would break up the one person monotony of this page. Looking for a run up to $4 before next earnings. After that, I feel its archaic business model will catch up with it again. It will hopefully do well though in the short-term as the teaching model this Fall is pushed toward on-line resources they offer. I got in this @ $2 last time and out at $3.35. Been averaging down and hoping to see that $4 in the next couple months."
"Keeeeppppp going. Hold on, don't let go. There's magic coming...."
HMHC Has been around since late 1800s and is in all California schools plus more plus online covid learning. This is FAR from a pump and dump I’ve been seeing dumb post
California governor has a press conference at 3 pm EST so this thing could explode in after-hours if he says that he is shutting schools down and only doing online.
Just bought 300 shares for 2.05. This is a screaming deal. I understand that with schools in flux that this stock is affected...but this could be overcome with some solid PR. Because without the volume...it's gonna be a long Summer!
Nice chart today. Slow and steady gains on below average volume. I like that.
Good hold. It’s a solid company in a new age.
Fauci testifying right now on capital hill. He said we must keep the social distancing plan in place for an extended time and we do not know when it will end! translation: kids ain't going back to school and will require remote learning...
Just found out that HMHC got alerted by https://shr.link/Beststockalerts. Seems bullish
Breaking news!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Volume is increasing dramatically, significant interest is coming into this stock."
Amazing stock! Definitely going to be huge with schools opening!$6.50 is within reach! Have a great long labor day weekend!
They have a lot of contracts in online schooling so this stock is on sale 
"We need some sort of event or news to renew interest in this company. If next quarter revenues are good and the growth of the new online offerings are good, I can easily see it jumping up to the $5-6 range. Especially if the 15% staff cuts happen. I do hate watching dead money as it just sits there unmoving. Any guesses as to when we might see a catalyst to get this thing moving again?"
"Hmmm nice gain again today, up 13% as we speak but can it Hold it unlike the other day. My order sits below to get in'. I know most here probably have a position already. I trade it trends usually hold for 3-6 months. I do feel this is going to move large on an upside, maybe this is the beginning but maybe just a influx before earnings and a general market up swing. I still feel uneasy on the market in general for the next 3 months so thats my hesitation. I think earnings are going to be OK' that first week of Aug and the outlook 2 years is great. Once again tho', I'm in for smaller duration (but not day trade or 1 week time frames either) time 6 months top. Maybe I missed $1.48 last week and this rolls to $2.25-$2.50 again....that was the type of move I'm looking for ."
This one is ready to blow off some steam!
GREAT ER :)
Fox Business News just said kids twice a likely to spread the virus as much as adults. Back to school in Sept? NOPE! NOT HAPPENING!
Adding another 1000 Shares here at $2.21. I feel like this level....(maybe just slightly lower) will be the POP point or bounce. I'm well positioned now for next week. Good luck all!!
"The ""silverlining"" for investors is that there will be massive downsizing due to shift to Online Learning. This is sorely needed to trim this behemoth of an employer. Going forward, profitability will be achieved on consistent basis. My condolences to HMHC workers."
Keep it up. Imo bargain prices..1 month..i dont think anyone has the patience to double in a month
He issue is the millennials don’t know about this stock. This stock should be $8-$10 based on valuation.
"I spend most of Saturday analyzing HMHC's and LRN's 2019 10-Ks and here are my takeaways:1. HMHC's and LRN's 2019 financials are similar except for the following: A. HMHC has significantly larger Net Sales and larger Gross Profits, but LRN's Sales and Admin costs are less than half of HMHC's. B. HMHC's EBITDA is $50 million more than LRN's C. HMHC has way more #$%$ets but way more liabilities, but their shareholder's equity are roughly equal. Getting rid of the $638 million of long-term debt makes HMHC's balance sheet way better; it's got a lot more depth, but I'm not sure what's up with all the Deferred Revenue. 2. HMHC's Long-Term Debt can be eliminated if they can increase Net Sales by 5% while holding Cost of Sales constant, while decreasing Selling and Admin Expense by 15%, because it would increase annual cashflows from operating activities by $169 million. 3. With the Long Term Debt eliminated, HMHC could eek out a small Gain from Continuing Operations, with positive Cashflows from Operations almost doubling to $473 million and Free Cash Flow up to $333 million. 4. With the elimination of the Long-Term Debt, HMHC will have a better balance sheet and better cashflows than LRN, but not better GAAP Net Income, due to all the Depreciation and Amortization that HMHC expenses.5. Given the above, I think that HMHC market cap can achieve near parity with LRN, which currently has a market cap of $1.91 billion (5.4394 times HMHC's current market cap). If we equalize HMHC's and LRN's market cap, HMHC's stock price would be $15.25, which I think can be the top of HMHC's potential target price range over the next 3-5 years. I think the current price of about $3 is undervalued, but HMHC management has it's work cut out for them."
seems like tough resistance at 2.75. hopefully outlook for remainder of the year that hopefully they will share next week will get us over the hump. Seems like HMHC would a good candidate for PE takeout.
"Unlike normal pump and dumps, this is a company that has been around for a very very long time, has a fantastic balance sheet/cash position, and is well poised to capitalize on Covid. So welcome pumpers. I think many of you will realize that you should not dump! This is a company you invest in for the long haul."
"Boy ole boy.....the Board at HMH just keeps selling their shares. Just waited again for it to pop'....relatively from $4 to $6.50 and then report earnings,...and then they dumped more of their shares. They see it......it's a year away or so still....but....we all see it......."
This stock does not make it easy to hold :(
"HMHC should be renamed The Learning Company. Might as well, I mean from a marketing standpoint, the name HMHC is a dinosaur. HMHC owns the very same company that once was sold to Mattel for $4.2 billion in the fall of 1998: name, trademarks, copyrights, media properties, and all. I see synergy that has not been utilized between their Education and Book & Media divisions. If you look at their Book & Media catalogue, you will recognize names and titles that will impress and excite you. Yet when you look at the Education business, it's not quite as inspiring, actually downright clinical if you ask me. HMHC would be wise to cross-pollenate their two business divisions to jazz things up and drive sales and marketing."
The first of many Municipalities to move to HMHC. This is huge.
HMHC is up 4.96% to 7.40
great trade premarket = 1 share LMFAO
Shorts are relentless. Hold your shares. Squeeze these shorts. Let’s get north of $3.00 today.
Any kind of news..we go to 5
"As it becomes clearer and clearer that Trump will win, these beaten down Covid stocks will return to normal. HMHC has 99% institutional investment and they will force it back up to re-coup any paper losses. Once Trump wins the prolonged shutdown will end in a NY minute!"
"The party is over, time to head for the exits!"
This is just MM-induced movements. This is a dead company. Selling off pieces with a big question market regarding their business model. Going concern becoming an issue. Look at the volume pushing up this stock. Mass exodus by retail investors after last Earnings Report. The recent rise in stock price is a mirage.
This one going to 5-6 in a week or so. News is real
I guess we're waiting for 19M shares to be distributed...
This has almost half the market cap it had 3 days ago? Boy the world sure changes fast
Lots of newbies here lately lol. Welcome all. Few of us have been long for a good while and excited for the pop. Don't sell until it reaches it's value of at least $6!
"3-team play(LRN, HMHC, and BOXL). Keep an eye on these three stocks. When 2 of these go way up, be prepared for a mass dump @ closing on one of these to go into the another. Someone dumped 60K of LRN twice and bought 90K of HMHC twice simultaneously @ 1pm closing yesterday.Hope this helps you guys."
box light sells electronic blackboards for use in classrooms whereas HMHC has the monopoly on school books and soon to have the monopoly on digital curriculums from distance learning. No comparison. Basic rule in investing is always go with the best of breed! Long and strong even without the added COVID bonus!
#NAK undervalue and most talk today...buy nowbefore it will go up
growing now
There are 2 patents filed under $HMHC FUNOMENOL And HMH ANYWHERE go check it out
This gonna be a week hold for me I believe we see ~4.50-5 soon
The entire market is setting up for a tank. It’s going to happen soon....
"When the stock was at $5.20, this valuation analysis said HMHC stock was significantly undervalued by 46%.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-houghton-mifflin-harcourt-142814439.html"
"Once people calm the F down, this stock will settle at $3.15 by end of day. Having said that, the management team did a very poor job of managing investor expectations. I think Jack Lynch is not well-experienced in managing a publicly traded company. If they don't do a better job, investors will just ignore this company and they run the risk of being delisted, unless they cut costs by 15% across the board and actually post a GAAP profit each quarter. My god, this is still amateur hour at the 187 year old business."
Going to $3.50+ in After Hours today
mmm! can we hold above 2.80?
expect it will push highs in the 8-10 range once the back to school pandemic panic really starts!
"On June 8th, 2015, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company was almost $27 a share and was probably the rage in education materials and media. Today, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is a penny stock. We always sit astonished and sometimes dazed at how times change, and Bob Dylan captured the phenomenon and feeling well in his mythical song on the subject.One-time Giants like JC Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond are now either dead or breathing their last breath.My, my how times have changed. They certainly have."
"Does LRN really have that much of a better product? Because LRN's stock price has gone parabolic since March 1 2020, while HMHC has gone down the toilet during that same period."
"Price action is weird, someone is pumping it up then immediately dumping it in bulk, sell volumes are distributed in larger chunks while buy volume is slow with the offers magically disappearing.. very odd"
Adding on the dip. There website seems hosed... can someone paste some numbers here?
"CEO just sold 6000 more shares at $1.27 this week. Think my thoughts are done now, on considering to BUY. The Board sold at ton at $4.00 they don't see a good outlook, so they sold me on the same. Moving on. Good Luck to you all in your trades. You too Marty."
"Calm down jeez , we saw 150% gains in 2 days. Expect a pullback"
52 week low here might be a good time to buy. Balance sheet is fairly strong and they have taken steps to reduce expenses. Business was respectable prior to the virus with cash flow of 115M last quarter.
I noticed that institutional ownership ranges from 94% to 99.8% (depending on the source). That certainly explains the random giant price swings as they pickup or drop giant chunks of shares. Let's hope a few decide to add to their positions as school openings draw closer.
"This thing needs volume, and when it does it is going back over 3.20$"
$NIO $FL $HMHC $AAPL Why sell today when you could sell higher tomorrow? I would buy more instead .
States getting federal emergency money to pay for online curriculums
If you are planning on waiting until the senate and house pass the next stimulus bill on sep 8 you will miss the boat. The stock will be 4 bucks by then. The smart money is loading in the low 2s to get an easy double maybe triple!
"At home learning still requires HMHC books. Teachers Corner, etc are a newly added revenue streams thanks to Covid. Win win situation for Hmhc! The Q3 earnings will reflect this and the stock will trade 6+ by then. Why wait to buy at 3+ when you can get it under 3 now?"
Can’t wait till this is 6-7
Two 20% days in a row. This will continue until it gets into the 3s.

under 2 is a gift and won't last long. buy now or be sorry later. once august comes this goes in to beast mode full on!
volume just came in...Looks some traders are betting on the upside for tomorrow.
"FYI....Teachers across the nation are beginning to quit or ""leave"" the industry, in that this remote teaching is too stressful and just not going well. Unfortunately, I get it and I've seen a few departures scheduled this winter break at our local schools. Hopefully that stops and should when the virus is gone...but that may not be until we loose alot in May June as well. Hmmm**The other thing as for HMH products....the schools/districts are realizing that they are NOT owning the NEW online connected curriculum and are just renting it, compared to the old fashioned books. (you buy...you own)---They are stepping back and rethinking. Which is good, but the Sale'......maybe be more difficult now as they see this. Does HMH have this ""time"" left.....this company is going to be at crossroads in the Summer of 2021."
"Outlook sounds and extremely well positioned for the future. Doesn't sound horrible, but at the same like all companies not great either. Early retirement being offered if over 55 and 5 years in at HMH. Says they are extremely well positioned for the new environment but needs to become leaner, and more focused on Connected products. There is definitely a plan in place and sounds like on the right track. Let's see what the market will do on this news. The future is bright here, but today may be a hiccup. We'll see."

Safe bet this is going to $5 in the near term.
So look at all that interest in 8/21 call options at $5. Hmm that sounds yummy.
Hold tight. It is all manipulation to get cheap shares. This will go up fast.
Now the stock is worth buying. Its unfortunate it took the company so long to pull this off. The virus just sped up what the company needed to do. At least management finally got the guts to do it. Not easy but absolutely necessary.
How's is this going to help if there home schooled. There's maybe something I missed

"New AP announced called ""HMH ANYWHERE"". Available now on Iphones and soon for Android. Allows for you to be online or offline. When back online it updates to the teacher. Also new Assessment measure called ""GROWTH MEASURE"" now up and running. It constantly updates and assesses. Company is well positioned for this new remote schooling. Products are there and ready. They were 2 or 3 years too early -we thought...but now they seem to be in demand. Just needs to expose the Schools and train the teachers on these new products. AMIRA..is another new product it uses Artificial intelligence and is mind blowing!! All this on their new platform called ED'...and transitioning out of ""THINK CENTRAL""."

"Although billings were respectable and refinancing the debt is wise, margins are still inadequate. Further job cuts are required or prices need to be raised to. Not certain management understands the severity of the situation. Making some progress yes, but more needs to be done. On the positive side estimated Q4 sales numbers seem low. Costs however will be inflated due to financing and severance costs. Its a shame they did not go for 15% cuts overall when they had the chance. Need to become more efficient and fast."
"Something wrong here, everything is up today except this."
HMHC quietly filed trademarks for “HMH Anywhere” an app that can be used on computers and cell phone devices.

"This new product they are offering seems to be the real deal. I don't think it is life changing tech like Zoom, but could make some good traction with schools. Definitely a chance for the company to increase growth. Even if sales stay stable, they should get back to their pre-covid $6 share price. We may not spike to $20 to day, but $8 by end of 2020 is certainly quite plausible."
Thoughts on tomorrow? Up or down?
I'm in LETS GO!!!
"Geeze I didn't realize the New product ""Teachers Corner""...which went live today, was going to be such a huge catalyst. It is cool and will be valuable but didn't think that was going to move it that much. It's been talked about and and being developed over the past year, so it wasn't a secret. Good tho. Great move"
how high can this go?
I left. took a 25% loss...can't wait for this.stock anymore
"Why is there so little communication on this board? They have been cutting back cost, going to online, virtual, still selling books, and have cash flow, cash on hand. This should at least be $6+"
"I have seen several school districts opting to give parents the choice of on-line or in class participation for their kids. I figure a sizeable portion will choose on-line if they can. Then, once the school year starts up there will likely be widespread upsurge in COVID cases reported and that is going to create even more pressure to either shut in class totally or if not push more folks to choose on-line. HMHC has lots of business contacts with schools from their normal text book sales. It is an easy to imagine they will get at least some new business from these contacts. On top of this, there seems to be a herd mentality in the markets right now, once the small scale retail crowd gets a whiff of it I can see a spike in the stock price. I have already been placing some bets on this scenario. I figure a week or two into August at the latest...."

Whats a good entry point?
LRN issued $300M convertible notes because it knows it needs reinforcements to compete with the HMH Anywhere.
Teacher here. Solid company and these are bargain prices. Houghton Mifflin is a well-known company in education. Should be trading double to triple what we're at now based on revenue alone.
What’s a realistic price target for this? Down a bit and deciding whether to cut my losses or hold.
Is it advisable to buy this stock in AH?
"Their financials are solid. Not perfect but soid. EBITDA is positive, cash flow is positive. Schools will need to order books for the coming year. The price does not make sense! I see this going back to the $3-$6 range once Covid passes."
this should pick up volumes before end of the day. finger crossed!
Breaking through that ceiling. Love it. Bye Bye shorts.
going up big. buy pm tomorrow and let it rideeeee
Going to $5+
After hours pop?Any idea what that is about?
Just look at the market cap from a year ago. This will still double in the next few weeks. I'm adding a few more where I can.
"Been watching this drop again from the high last month of $2.75. I do want in, because I did miss $1.03 and was watching it when it happened. I did grab some other awesome gains elsewhere, but I think we are headed back to testing that low again. Very few schools have set plans yet, and are wishy washy. Several other reasons....and of course earnings and NEW guidance coming out the first week of Aug. I think as more holders puke out their positions this July, and based on upcoming info.....the IN' ....some of us are waiting for will be revealed.. Too early to have a feel, but looks like the $1.03 may be tested again in the next few weeks. Keep an eye out, this may be an opportunity again, just not here at $1.49. Time to sit back and watch and let it come to us. Good Luck everyone. Remember to cash in when you have good profits going!!!"
so did they beat ER or not?
Lot of buys want to buy cheap
holding or selling before close?
Massive run next week and in to Sept. Books and online offerings. That's the ticket!
Why did their Board sell all their Holdings back at the end of March around $4.00? Something is not right if the Board members are selling their stock? I'm thinking about grabbing a position but I need to know more first. Maybe they should sell off parts of the company.
I wish I would have got in when all the institutions was notified
NICE.......Here we go....get some legs for Monday and the huge rally for next week!!! She is shaving and waxing them for us on this Sexy stock for July. Nice and tan next week!

"The most important takeaway from yesterday's ER was that they are in the process of retiring 18% of their labor force this quarter. I was hoping for 15%, so I'm happy. They have a lot of iconic properties that they need to exploit. This will be at $15 next year."
$4 next week.
The slow and steady climb on tiny volume continues. Not much pressure to sell so any new buyers are driving the price up. Any surprise good news will cause a big spike.
"Headed back to $1.50, you were warned. Sell your shares to new bagholders."
"""The company is launching a product called Teacher's Corner. This online experience will provide educators tools to improve their skills. It includes video series from other teachers, live coaching events, and a place for educators to connect with one another."""
"I have a feeling this is going pop from its $1.60 today. I'm debating on getting in at $1.50 instead of it breaking below, down around $1.20-$1.30...I have a better outlook now on it now, but No Feel on when to get in. I still feel a market meltdown is coming in general in the next month or so. Any body have any thoughts? or feel? Thanks"
I love reading the basher posts from a few days before a stock starts to soar. Very entertaining.
"This was a very easy buy at this dip. The company has been around for so many years, and education (online) is going nowhere."
Adding BOXL on a down day and could finish strong as their online schooling continues to flourish
New to this stock... Question for the people who knows this company..Does this company offering anything to support distance learning possibility in the upcoming school year?
Let’s get to 3.30 AH!
one drop of good news and this has to sky rocket at this point.
"A $250M market cap with over $1B in annual sales. And free cash flow positive. If they pull this reorg off well and manage to pay down their debt, this could be a $10 stock in a few years. I see little reason it can't get back into the $3-4 range before earnings."
I feel the bottom has been established at 2.6. Should close above 3 still.
"In a nutshell, HMHC needs to grow Net Sales by 5% each year while holding Cost of Sales down, and reduce Sales & Admin Exp by 15% and hold them proportional to gross profits yoy. They will then be able to pay off their Long-term debts in 4 years. 4-yr TP should be $15, gapping up $3 each year. I think this company tries to do too many things, and would benefit from breaking up/ spinning off their various divisions/businesses. But they have an interesting portfolio of businesses and intellectual properties."
This company is easily a 2x if not 3x bagger. This will run up right before earnings again. Mark my words.................
"The main issue for HMHC growth is this: given the ongoing paradigm shift from in-person schooling to online schooling in K-12 schools, who is the market leader and how much market share will the numbers 1-3 players get? Is HMHC poised to be a top 3 player in this new landscape? Is LRN capable of becoming a winner-take-all winner, or will they have problems scaling and satisfying everyone in this growing market? Besides LRN, who are the other players? I don't see Chegg as a competitor because i don't think they have built an online platform for K-12 online learning. Are the other competitors besides LRN all fledgling startups like Boxlight? If that's the case, then HMHC is grossly undervalued given that they are growing so fast in the online learning space. The caveat to this perhaps free resources like Kahn Academy may be fulfilling online learning needs more than is being reported in the media."
So how are things going? Looking for anyone else here. Would like to talk. It’s getting lonely lol. How well has this played out so far for hmhc? Could we see above 4$ in the next few days and above 8$ in the next month?
"Great conference call with BMO Capital regarding state of HMHC by CEO and CFO. HMHC has work relationship with 90% of public schools. HMH Anywhere needs just 18% market penetration this year to make $500 Million in subscription fees for 2020. If they increase HMH Anywhere prices by 5% each year and increase their subscription base by 5% each year as well, they will reach $1 Billion in revenue just from HMH Anywhere sales by 2026. https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2020-techsummit-houghtonmifflinharcourt#/"
"Sad Shape. Earnings miss, and looking to sell a chunk of company off, after it just layed off 22%. I guess they have to sell to stay a float, but really....all bad signs here for a while now. Good Luck."
New investor to HMHC. Picked up 1200 shares the past couple day.
"https://twitter.com/mbubss/status/1284629114662658048?s=21 here’s a little dd on the company, helps summarize and show how good this company is. Super under valued and has a lot of potential to return to its levels in February"
"$hmhc listen this was 6$ when schools were in because it’s in the textbook and teacher tools, so when COVID hit and schools got canceled this stock got really hurt , now they have a put together a plan over the last few months and that’s what tonight is about for online remote learning , so school open or closed this thing WILL recover , just hold my ninjas"
"The conference call was a waste of time. The elephant in the room was not mentioned at all by management nor brought up by questions. That item was related to variable expenses specifically for gross margin. What happened to the Feb goal of variable cost of 39% being achieved? Sales up $31M for the quarter Direct COGS up $30M. You would think this would be the only issue outside of billings that should have been discussed. Is this an anomaly or the new variable structure going forward? Was it due to greater implementation costs, royalty expenses, product costing? If this is the new reality then the company better quickly figure out how to save elsewhere and fast. Otherwise the company should put itself up for sale now before the stock price worsens or current reasonable market conditions change. This company had an opportunity to shine this year. It appears their financial or operational planning is subpar or a combination of both is inadequate. Letting sales run amok without proper financial planning is a combination of sales operations and financial incompetence."
Why the drop pre-market? Are ER results out 
"This stock has been on fire since the brief dip to 1.03 three weeks ago. They have been moving to digital offerings during Covid and cut way back to save cash. Even if it only makes it halfway back the roughly $6/share it was at before the pandemic, seems like a safe bet to get a quick 50% return or more..."
This thing jumps in plateaus out in a weird way don’t be scared this thing will jump￼
"Any sign or hope for a vaccine implies a reduced need for Long Distance learning which is the critical factor for both HMHC and LRN. AZN will reveal its' long awaited clinical update and the news is supposed to be VERY good which will carnk up the market but put HMHC and LRN on hold for a day or two. LRN did not go up Monday, in fact went down and HMHC dropped to $2.71 in AH's. Wait for the news and price drop before entering. Just a thought."
"If the stimulus passes and contains money for cities and schools, this is a $4 stock before earnings and an $8 stock by christmas."
too many early sellers this morning. this could easily be over 3 by now if people would chill out for a while with the selling for pennies
Volume today of over 25 Million is super bullish. Could easily double from here due to COVID and schools rushing to online classes.
So that's how it gonna be! y'all wanna playhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw
gonna have to do a lot of heavy lifting to get to those $5 calls friday
Now’s the time to buy. I got in at 2.8 and I’m not nervous one bit. It should run after lunch

Just bought into this hope it grows
"HMHC is ONLINE education and has secret information about this in its website banners to me though this looks like a full online curriculum all the banners have Covid in the text and even the images. https://www.hmhco.com/learningsupport/educator-support Even a guide on mitigating Covid-19 learning loss. Even building resources for how schools can get relief funds.THIS IS BIG for this leader in education - at a minimum this chart alone should $2.40+Last week they Introduced Teacher's Corner, a First-of-its-Kind Online Professional Learning Environment that Empowers Educators in a Remote Worldhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-introduces-teachers-153600128.html"
I get the feeling that the pump and dumpers from BOXL have caught wind of HMHC which explains the unusual pre and post market activity lately.
"I mean seriously, get in early tmrw"
too late to get in? was following from 2.20 
"What could the new stimulus bill include?While it’s possible Senate Republicans ultimately do not offer new legislation, here’s what could be included:$300 weekly unemployment benefits$105 billion in school funding$250 billion in funding for the Payment Protection Program (PPP)$10 billion grant to the U.S. Postal ServiceBefore October 1, Congress will need to fund the federal government for the upcoming fiscal year. It’s also possible that Republicans include a stimulus bill as part of that stop gap funding, or incorporate stimulus bill into discussions with Democrats on broader government funding."
guys im new to stock and bought in at 2.90 hoping it would soar and seeing it now is a heartbreaker. should i sell? is there any hope?
a week of hard fought gains wiped out in 10 minutes. Back to the starting line again.
Great company - price of the stock should be around $6.50
Easy buy at these levels.
Columbus schools select HMHC for their online learning platform.
sub 2 coming? melting ice cube? still there are some good elements to their story...selling at a fraction of rev and at least they have revenues...they should announce plans for an electric car and they would be $10b company
Starting to gain some momentum right now. Hop in if you're not yet! It will take off without you
"GOP's new plan Stimulus plan is looking to add $70 Billion for K-12 Schools...must be at least a hybrid of part time in school and some at home. Funding to get Tablets, chrome books, etc....and new curriculum to support it as well. Wow,...if HMH could tap into just a percentage of this. Either way, there's new talk on how education will be changing not only this year but for the future and Remote'...will be a huge chunk....probably forever now. Example...( if kids are sick in the future...stay home....all week. And when you can, log on and do your work.)"
Anyone know if there is a reason why price is down 12% now besides more selling?
Yup how much of this company is institution owned? How do institutions become that big? Because they know more than retail ..alot more.. so if you feel they are poorly positioned you should sell..if you think it's future is brighter then buy. I will be adding more tommorow. Gltu
"Im in at 3.05, this may be a good point to average down."
"Layoffs next week here at HMH. Part of the plan from covid response. Gave early retirement last month but still needs to become Leaner'. Maybe the cost cut will give this stock a pop some?? Maybe cutting the help'....may just put more headaches on those who remain, and irate customers even more?? A restructure of staff and depts also be arranged for 2021. New products....for remote did ok for the 1st year, but nothing close to Great. Teachers need to be trained. 2021 needs to be ""right on' for this company or deep problems are headed their way, fast. I'm loaded up here as well....any pop' to $2.50-$2.70....I'm out. Good luck."

"CEO making an announcement in an hour or so, on effort to Help- back to school -crisis. Lets see if its anything new or news worthy as a stock holder."
Get ready for a boom
I have been tracking and buying this stock for 2 weeks. 20k shares at avg cost of $1.26. I do not understand the steep decline and this should be back up in the $5 range soon.
"Just so you all know, the $638million of LT Debt that HMHC had on their 12-31-19 balance sheet pertained to their $575 million acquisition of Scholastic's online education program. So it wasn't as if they were racking up debt because they were bleeding money. Their cashflow and EBITDA over the last 3 years (since Jack Lynch too over in Feb 2017) has been solid. They paid off $100million of their LT Debt in 2019 and I think is part of their restructuring plan (pay off over the next 3-5 years) so that they can free up $50million in annual interest expense. They can eventually be profitable on a GAAP basis, but they still have to cut Sales&Admin expense by 15%, but how hard could that be?"
Wow. Alot of bouncing in this range 2.75-3.00...which way is it going to break thru???!!!
Let’s see should buy a few thousand shares
It'll skyrocket now. Chance to Hit $5 this week.
"Thoughts on holding thru earnings? I don't expect the actual numbers to be great, but the forward looking message should be positive...."
Light on fire shorts.. Education... innovative ...in these times? Lol . yup
Great entry here for a week or two swing or long if you want
Doing research on HMHC: does anyone know why did the market cap drop from around $2B in 2015 to about $600M pre-covid in Feb 2020?
Just keeps selling off ...hopefully we get to see 2 bucks or less today as a reward for buying this
