"41M students assigned to their online program called Ed as of June 2020. HMH Anywhere charges a $50 annual fee per student that includes teacher licenses for free and Teacher's Corner also included for free. $50 x 41M students = $2B of subscription fees per year for HMH Anywhere and Teacher's Corner. LRN's annual revenue is a little over $1B, their market cap is $1.73B. HMHC's market cap is $284M. If you equalize their market caps with the $2B of potential revenue from HMH Anywhere, then HMHC's share price would be $13.77. Keep in mind they also have the HMH Books and Media business that avg $200M in annual revenues.HMHC are cutting their entire workforce by 18% this quarter."
#NAK undervalue and most talk today...buy nowbefore it will go up
"The cryptocurrency market is now worth more than the world’s most valuable company after bitcoin and several leading altcoins surged in price. The global crypto market cap is now $2.37 trillion (£1.73tn), overtaking the $2.33tn market cap of Apple, reaching above $58,000 to close in on its record all-time high of $64,000.

"Great conference call with BMO Capital regarding state of HMHC by CEO and CFO. HMHC has work relationship with 90% of public schools. HMH Anywhere needs just 18% market penetration this year to make $500 Million in subscription fees for 2020. If they increase HMH Anywhere prices by 5% each year and increase their subscription base by 5% each year as well, they will reach $1 Billion in revenue just from HMH Anywhere sales by 2026. https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2020-techsummit-houghtonmifflinharcourt#/"
"Volume is increasing dramatically, significant interest is coming into this stock."
I love reading the basher posts from a few days before a stock starts to soar. Very entertaining.
"""The company is launching a product called Teacher's Corner. This online experience will provide educators tools to improve their skills. It includes video series from other teachers, live coaching events, and a place for educators to connect with one another."""
"Someone explain this... the average EPS expectation of $0.53 is about same as actual EPS from a year ago of $0.55. However, the stock price is right below 50% of the price from previous earning. Shouldn't this at least double over next few days especially with the planned digital growth?"

Columbus schools select HMHC for their online learning platform.
"New AP announced called ""HMH ANYWHERE"". Available now on Iphones and soon for Android. Allows for you to be online or offline. When back online it updates to the teacher. Also new Assessment measure called ""GROWTH MEASURE"" now up and running. It constantly updates and assesses. Company is well positioned for this new remote schooling. Products are there and ready. They were 2 or 3 years too early -we thought...but now they seem to be in demand. Just needs to expose the Schools and train the teachers on these new products. AMIRA..is another new product it uses Artificial intelligence and is mind blowing!! All this on their new platform called ED'...and transitioning out of ""THINK CENTRAL""."
"HMHC is ONLINE education and has secret information about this in its website banners to me though this looks like a full online curriculum all the banners have Covid in the text and even the images. https://www.hmhco.com/learningsupport/educator-support Even a guide on mitigating Covid-19 learning loss. Even building resources for how schools can get relief funds.THIS IS BIG for this leader in education - at a minimum this chart alone should $2.40+Last week they Introduced Teacher's Corner, a First-of-its-Kind Online Professional Learning Environment that Empowers Educators in a Remote Worldhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-introduces-teachers-153600128.html"
"Why is there so little communication on this board? They have been cutting back cost, going to online, virtual, still selling books, and have cash flow, cash on hand. This should at least be $6+"
"I spend most of Saturday analyzing HMHC's and LRN's 2019 10-Ks and here are my takeaways:1. HMHC's and LRN's 2019 financials are similar except for the following: A. HMHC has significantly larger Net Sales and larger Gross Profits, but LRN's Sales and Admin costs are less than half of HMHC's. B. HMHC's EBITDA is $50 million more than LRN's C. HMHC has way more #$%$ets but way more liabilities, but their shareholder's equity are roughly equal. Getting rid of the $638 million of long-term debt makes HMHC's balance sheet way better; it's got a lot more depth, but I'm not sure what's up with all the Deferred Revenue. 2. HMHC's Long-Term Debt can be eliminated if they can increase Net Sales by 5% while holding Cost of Sales constant, while decreasing Selling and Admin Expense by 15%, because it would increase annual cashflows from operating activities by $169 million. 3. With the Long Term Debt eliminated, HMHC could eek out a small Gain from Continuing Operations, with positive Cashflows from Operations almost doubling to $473 million and Free Cash Flow up to $333 million. 4. With the elimination of the Long-Term Debt, HMHC will have a better balance sheet and better cashflows than LRN, but not better GAAP Net Income, due to all the Depreciation and Amortization that HMHC expenses.5. Given the above, I think that HMHC market cap can achieve near parity with LRN, which currently has a market cap of $1.91 billion (5.4394 times HMHC's current market cap). If we equalize HMHC's and LRN's market cap, HMHC's stock price would be $15.25, which I think can be the top of HMHC's potential target price range over the next 3-5 years. I think the current price of about $3 is undervalued, but HMHC management has it's work cut out for them."
"This new product they are offering seems to be the real deal. I don't think it is life changing tech like Zoom, but could make some good traction with schools. Definitely a chance for the company to increase growth. Even if sales stay stable, they should get back to their pre-covid $6 share price. We may not spike to $20 to day, but $8 by end of 2020 is certainly quite plausible."
"CEO just sold 6000 more shares at $1.27 this week. Think my thoughts are done now, on considering to BUY. The Board sold at ton at $4.00 they don't see a good outlook, so they sold me on the same. Moving on. Good Luck to you all in your trades. You too Marty."
"Hmmm nice gain again today, up 13% as we speak but can it Hold it unlike the other day. My order sits below to get in'. I know most here probably have a position already. I trade it trends usually hold for 3-6 months. I do feel this is going to move large on an upside, maybe this is the beginning but maybe just a influx before earnings and a general market up swing. I still feel uneasy on the market in general for the next 3 months so thats my hesitation. I think earnings are going to be OK' that first week of Aug and the outlook 2 years is great. Once again tho', I'm in for smaller duration (but not day trade or 1 week time frames either) time 6 months top. Maybe I missed $1.48 last week and this rolls to $2.25-$2.50 again....that was the type of move I'm looking for ."
Just bought 300 shares for 2.05. This is a screaming deal. I understand that with schools in flux that this stock is affected...but this could be overcome with some solid PR. Because without the volume...it's gonna be a long Summer!
This hasn’t popped yet. $6.85 precovid and just today released amazing pr for both online students and teachers
