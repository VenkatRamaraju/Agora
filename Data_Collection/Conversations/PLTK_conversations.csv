"After pltk will publish their er and finanical reports, the analysts will understand their potential, now without this data its very difficult to recommend on this stock....But, and there is a big but, if you understand the bussines and their way to earn you can be sure that they going to above 38-40 in the short term (reports on feb 25), and in the long term i think there is no limit for them even 3 digits."
This company owns 9 of the top 100 highest grossing mobile games including SlotMania. I asked my son an avid player of SlotMania if he knew about the IPO and he did not. Therefore i would expect after this initial shakeup a quick move to the 40’s..It is around 31.39 now I bought some at 32.60 and 31.80..This company makes big revenues profit unlike so many others out there..Glta
not much activity here. how come?
So glad I didn't buy too much of this!
what is it down 8 % in after-hours??
Playtika Holding is up 4.92% to 28.16
Back in 25.31 x 1000
Still says strong buy on TD from 5 out of 5 analysts. Hope we get some news on this soon.
What time will it start trading?
more and more hedge funds are buying PLTK in bulk. so future seems pretty stable. love it
Great news!
How do you guys assess this against Zynga? Both have around 2 Billion in revenue and both valued about 6x revenue.. 12 billion market cap.. What is the growth story here.. I feel this space will grow with MGM online gambling.. Or is this a pure play/advertising stock? Any information helps..
better buy now in the lows before the earnings in 3 weeks when it will probably double itself

I had completed days one through six of the Medals challenge. While I was playing day seven. The app, Poker Heat’s system, suddenly stopped awarding me four medals for every 20-million I won. It malfunctioned. I began sending in messages reporting the malfunction on 7-30-21 at 6:28 PM CST. The system began malfunctioning at roughly 6PM CST. Didn’t notice it at first. Ultimately I did not receive, Was Not Credited, the medals needed to complete day seven while in the game. Prizes completed were for $15 million for completing Day-7. With an additional $233 million for completing the Olympic medal case all seven days. Which I completed successfully!! Prizes earned have not been awarded with no response from your support team.￼￼￼￼As shown in the box. 0/20M chips, was not registering chips earned/gained. Should be any number except for zero in the 20 million box. Poker Heat stopped counting my winnings and stopped awarding medals around 6 PM CST on day seven of the medals challenge. Realized it at 6:18 PM. Which was when I sent in my first message notifying Poker Heat something was wrong.Thanks, StevePS: have attempted to send screenshots which show my status and support the 20 million no longer counting and awarding me four medals for every 20,000,00 won. Your contact us portal only allows the file size to be one megabyte. My screenshots are 4.3 MB apiece, of which I tried to send four. I asked for guidance on how to send the screenshots I want you to see. With no response. I also attempted through email to send Amia Richards the same Screenshots but those did not go through either. Amia had responded to a separate feedback submission before the Poker Heat app malfunctioned."
