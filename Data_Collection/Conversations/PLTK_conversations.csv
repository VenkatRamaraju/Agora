"Next week, after the inauguration, there will be a sigh of relief, and it will be clear what a bargain we are getting here at these prices. China U.S. relations will improve greatly and Today's nervous investors will have some serious FOMO on PLTK. Everyone buying today will be green soon."

How do you guys assess this against Zynga? Both have around 2 Billion in revenue and both valued about 6x revenue.. 12 billion market cap.. What is the growth story here.. I feel this space will grow with MGM online gambling.. Or is this a pure play/advertising stock? Any information helps..
I'm in.This will run to $100 very soon.
"Why would anyone buy this stock? Negative equity, PE ratio well over 50. The company constantly #$%$ of their players. Just about anyone can do online gaming and win real cash. Why play Pkaytika games with real cash and win nothing?"
Playtika yessssss
"Told you all, this is going to Xplode.. Get ready for launch!"
All we need is a tweet from Elon and we`re off and running

"Game stop is pumped like that and this is down??? Lol can someone tell these kids at reddit and Robinhood to pump up this one please??? Or do they only stick with stocks for kids? Amc, game stop. Is there a chuckle cheese stock??"

"After pltk will publish their er and finanical reports, the analysts will understand their potential, now without this data its very difficult to recommend on this stock....But, and there is a big but, if you understand the bussines and their way to earn you can be sure that they going to above 38-40 in the short term (reports on feb 25), and in the long term i think there is no limit for them even 3 digits."

"She is getting warm people hold and gain in a few months, dont sell for pennies"
Playtika issued outstanding financial results this morning and the stock is moving downward. Yet GameStop has #$%$ financials and it's stock is moving upwards. What gives?
I'll buy when it's $11.00 next week!
should pop here
$40 by end of week. Congrats to all who got in !
seems like opening at $55
"The float is 69.5 million shares; only 41 million shares traded so far, so price is likely to go lower before the end of the day."
WHY DO HIGH? ALL THE OTHER GAMING STOCKS $AESE and etc single digits
I got 10 shares whoo hoo
"Comparing this to ZNGA's valuation, PLTK should be $40. The report from ATVI bodes well for PLTK. Candy Crush is still crushing it on earnings for ATVI. PLTK has more popular games than Candy Crush. Buy and hold this gem for the earnings pop."
Great news!
Smart investment
i think this will rise very soon to 36-40 range
"Way to go, NASDAQ on keeping everyone informed as to when this starts trading, I’m certain all the hedge fund managers know when this begins trading because you know, the rich have to get richer..."

Long 2000 shares 24.50. At what point does the insiders stopSelling?!?! Think about you’re holders!!
"PLTK will climb every quarter.... $10B mkt cap is the floor. Next is $25, then $30, then $35. Longs will be rewarded."
There is a good chance it will go up to 45$ even before earnings.People know the ER will be great so they will get in before 25/02.
In 25.65 x 1000
2000 shares now thank you for the free mjney 
Now it’s a BUY at $31
I thought insider cant sell till 90 days?
"Playtika which owns Wooga has drastically made changes to June's journey game which limits on how we can obtain energy. They also have raised the prices for in-app purchases to be out of reach. $20 USD for a tree that last year cost 3000 coins. They have stated that they are trying to get non payers to be payers. There is a boycott within the game for a compromise but they refuse to listen, so therefore, we have stopped playing and refuse to purchase anything."
If I put limit at 30 will I get it
"Wow buy order set for 1000 more at open 30.03 hopefully it’ll fill. Set up for a nice swing trade,!"
Picked up 1000 at 30.00
Glad I sold. 19.00 next stop
This is a stock of 35-40 $.It's a matter of time.
Close $36.00 Plus
All in on this amazing stock!

MUTE all the people who don’t belong here. We are here toDiscuss stocks
"The market has been going up and this stock has been going down, what does that tell you. Everybody that says it’s going to new highs are dreaming. The tape doe not lie and the trend is your friend. Just remember that today’s lows will become tomorrow’s highs."
This stock never fails to disappoint. My worst investment so far.
ZNGA much cheaper
Playtika Holding Corp. is up 17.11% to $31.62
"The secret on Wall Street is to fade Israeli stocks in general as they have disappointed so much in the past. As you can see; it did not get much pop at the opening; albeit on a gloomy day on wall street. Love the Israelis, but their stocks are always suspect. Let's see if PLTK breaks the mold."
Its now a week in a row with upside momentum. First time I think it happen since the IPO
moon baby mooon
"What's going on with trading, must be waaaay too much of an imbalance?"
"When Dashboard had its IPO, it skyrocketed and all the self-proclaimed message board experts said it would tank. When it dropped from ~$160 to ~$140, they felt vindicated. Guess what? A few days later, it's over $190! Moral of the story. Nobody knows whats going to happen. You can guess and you'll have a 50% chance of being right in terms of whether it goes up from here. But all the info is already embedded in the price. So all we can say for sure is it's worth $31.50 as of 2:23PM ET today."
"It's looking like it will open at $34....Who's buying at $34? I'm thinking of waiting a week or 2 to see where this lands after the initial offering, the long weekend and ignoration. Thoughts???"
"I set my limit to 30, fingers crossed. I thought it would commence trading by 9:30 am.Did anyone get into Airbnb day of IPO?"
What a disaster! This was an IBD pick too! Can’t remember the last up day! Can’t believe management appears to have done nothing to change course.
Any new updates on this stock? How much and what time today?
Boring stock..
What’s the market cap at current price?
32.56 x 200
better buy now in the lows before the earnings in 3 weeks when it will probably double itself 
"It's not coincidental that there is such a significant, perpetual drop around the same time drastic negative changes were made in the game, causing players to leave in droves? I don't think so..."
Buy low now and hold stock for long time.
deeply under valued
Will pop 50% on next trading day
"Found it: 412M shares outstanding, 80% held by insiders @ $11 a share. Offered right now 20% @ $27 a share. So Fair Value for PPS would be somewhere around $14!! Do the math!!!Waiting for the dip."
Playtika Holding is up 6.45% to 23.42
AT LEAST WE GREEN TODAY ;;
what is it down 8 % in after-hours??
"""We want to be the bigest gaming company in the world"" says CEO Robert Antocol."
very good results!
"450 shares here at $33.00 avg. Will be adding more Tuesday. 4000 employees, offices all over the world. I see some big acquisitions being made here in the not so distant future!"
PLTK initiated with Outperform at Wedbush Morgan -- $42 targetJust released after hours. We will close at a new high tomorrow.
Interesting company!!
They are going to report full year earnings soon and the world will finally get exposure to the power of this company especially in this year with covid.

Going red today?
"Stay at home, play more games ... United Socialist States of America has just crossed 400K Covid deaths."
"Playtika scores mostly bull ratings as analyst coverage startsPositive ratings are in from Goldman Sachs (Buy), Stifel (Buy), Baird (Outperform), Credit Suisse (Outperform) and Morgan Stanley (Overweight)."
Back in 25.31 x 1000
Any news?? Is it opening today?

"With $ 1.75 billion in free cash flow, I think we still have new games and apps to buy. Hence the growth of the company's capitalization."
I traded this stock 4000 shares today and made 261.00 slow day have a great weeked

"Check out #pltk gonna be huge soon, don't miss out!"
I am hoping this stock can breakout past $36 a share and go upwards from there.
Well ouch
Dont blink ... this is gaining momo as a coiled sprint. High 30s prior to earnings ... 36 to 38 pps
market sell off guys hold tight
OVER PRIZED ---- WORTH $5
Something is cooking finally?
Wait till monday and see this open up huge as players find out about the ipo
Just remember that the numbers are based on the Corona year revenue. 2021 won’t be like that
all the market red today. wait for monday will sky high 50$+ just wait. or sell now and cry
Ok I’m buying more on Tuesday if it goes down more. Or opens the same nah I’ll buy no matter what. I opened a account and it’s like giving someone a hit of crack on payday. Very addictive I was close to spending 5.00 for more chips. Love the Texas holdem. I deleted the app. But I will buy more shares on Tuesday and let the addictive personality crazies make me rich.
Issue is all the debt they have because they actually bought all those games at high acquisition costs
"bought 300 shares at 26.70, going to buy closely the same amount of shares in USD value (20% to 50% more in Roblox than Playtika) of Roblox shares on Wednesday, I am feeling positive, in the medium and long-term, we might see a further fall in share price for the short-term, perhaps Playtika's current financial health (high debt, etc.) is causing the share price to be hammered down, but its future, its growth from the last quarter, its what's making wall street analysts putting in these high target prices is my guess.I think Roblox will be a better choice, but Playtika can be a good alternative, I am considering the current financial health by only putting the portion of money of my portfolio which I usually do for any small cap companies (even though Playtika is a large cap company), but yea, still feeling positive."
PLTK reached an all time high at 35.00
"only a buy in @$25, games and chip makers are doing incredible during the pandemic but will soon slow as life gets back to usual. Still it's a good company to get and hold long term."
This company owns 9 of the top 100 highest grossing mobile games including SlotMania. I asked my son an avid player of SlotMania if he knew about the IPO and he did not. Therefore i would expect after this initial shakeup a quick move to the 40’s..It is around 31.39 now I bought some at 32.60 and 31.80..This company makes big revenues profit unlike so many others out there..Glta
"Very beautiful growing anual charts... this company is good, but stock isn't. At some point stock will align"
"Knew this stock would be huge. Bought on IPO date, sure glad I did!"
I was told the ipo is tomorrow but have been unable to find any details thus far?
50$ really soon
"Great Adj EBITDA, but 2021 revenue of $2.44B, really??? They either are being too humble or do not anticipate any acquisition. For real, they expect only ~2% growth? After having 20%+ annual growth for the past 3 years?"
"""We own some of the most iconic free-to-play mobile games in the world, many of which are the No. 1 games in their respective genres,"" the filing said. ""As a result, we have steadily increased our user base and paying users, and have retained users over long periods of time."""
Sold ah made 100.00 on 1000 shares. I’ll see what happens mkndayb
After ER we will see 50+ easy!!
Ouch. I flip traded 200 shares today and made .25 a share. But I have 500 shares I’m down.... all good long term holder here
Seems like they start to get momentum in the way to the fair 40$ price
"Due to recent changes in Platika's June's Journey mobile game (1 million+ players, soon to be half that), expect a large drop in revenues. Players are boycotting the game and the company. 10,000 signatures on petition that company is ignoring. Expected quarterly and annual results to be impacted. SELL!Just my opinion"
Get in before it explodes..

I think this will rise to 32-33 range in april.
slingshot
Bounce back baby
hold for few months and u will be smiling
Good stocks only go up!
"IBD featured Playtika this week saying that in a sign of market leadership, the relative strength line has already hit a new high ahead of its upcoming earnings report (before market open Feb 25). Playtika delivering 300% earnings growth in 2021."
what is the float????
"Give this a chance , earning should be good and this need some exposure and it will run up , nice resistant line ."
65 by eow
pltk is in hyper growth phase and still profitable.
Playtika Holding is up 4.92% to 28.16
About to U turn!
Well I didn’t think I would be revisiting this stock ever lol. Back in yesterday at 24.83 why the dip??
This will gain momentum around 2 pm
Pure #$%$
No 23.52 average I’m still taking a beating!!
Wasting money
"This IPO will tank ... Why? Because it is already making money. This market prefers companies that lose money, actually losing more as they make more revenues. I have a buy order at $20. It will get there in a week or two."
"Its so funny that there are negative reactions here. This are desperate guys that just want to get in at low price. else, why they bother to post here on IPO? LOL"
Just wait
"Stock will continue to drop, as customer activity and spending drop, reducing profits on the next quarterly report. This is due to customers leaving and boycotting games after major changes by the company to increase spending."
Expected to see a run up with this considering they have a decent cash flow. Hopefully Robinhood traders will become interested when they receive their stimulus checks and are looking for some bargains with potential.
Ohh last trade was a buy. 25.78 x 1000 shares
finally
What time will it start trading?
"This should be way up not GME ,,,"
will get 37 by eow
$27 is an excessive evaluation for their fundamentals.
I can get use to this greenes
"As of today, PLTK stock is now trading on the Nasdaq Exchange.During its IPO, Playtika raised $1.9 billion by offering 69.5 million shares at $27 each.This was above its IPO range of $22-$24 and initial estimates for it to raise $1.6 billion.New investors at this time include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Caledonia and Tiger Global Management.Founded by Robert Antokol and Uri Shahak, Playtika is currently based in Israel.However, Chinese investors Giant Network Group and Yunfeng Capital control the Playtika holdings company.Following the IPO, the holdings company will maintain 80% of the voting power.Additionally, investors should note that Playtika is related to Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR).At one point, a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment held Playtika. However, that unit, Caesars Interactive, sold Playtika to the Chinese investors in 2o16.Playtika still offers the popular Caesars Casino game in addition to names like Bingo Blitz and Solitaire Grand Harvest.For investors, there are a few things that stand out about PLTK stock. Unlike other recent debuts, Playtika is already profitable and produces healthy cash flow.As Renaissance Capital highlights though, two of its top titles accounted for half of its fiscal 2019 revenue."
"Bought 500 at 29.03 sold at 29.58. Holding 1500’shares. Willing to sell 500 at 31.00 the other 1000 gonna forget about ,"
Who thinks the stock will reach $ 45 after the reports?I'm sure.
Can we find a bottom please?
Ok 31.85 grabbed 200 more ah thanks
"god stock for invest, 31.12.2021 - 65$"
always up pre/after market but goes down like roller coaster during regular trading hours.
Can easily see $100 by the end of 2021.
"it will IPO overpriced, like all the rest this year. MM will buy at IPO price and then dump it 12 hours later making 100% profit."
"This is such an awesome company!! Their numbers are incredible, they make a ton of money,creative products, why isn't their stock slamming it? I wished more companies had this kind ofbusiness model. Earnings report this month will tell it all. I'm hanging with these fellas."
"if the chines buy the company PLAYTIKA for 4.3 bilion $ from MGM the now way,to rimind all MGM BAY THE COMPANY FOR 250 MILION $ MGM MAKE A BIG AKZIT. I NOW THE COMPNY MAKE 8 MILIOS$ A DAY"
Is there any bottom to this stock? Since IPO it keeps sinking on one direction. So it is either Yahoo wrong about insiders holdings or people just love to lose money
Sold my last 1000 shares today. Broke even. Open alert at new 52 week low. Seems to be heading that way
I am in
Good news this week end more institutions will buy from gambling industry
Buy at close or after hour. Should bounce on Tuesday
"PLTK makes money ... ZNGA games are junk.For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Playtika reported revenue of $1.8 billion, up 29% from the year-ago period. It reported net income of $16 million vs. $259 million in the year-ago period."
Yahoo shows 52 weeks low as $8. So Yahoo playing short now .
what games are they making
Lol amazing! All good I still have 500 shares for the “ever” hold. But the last 2 days it’s not been gradable now it’s climbing. No more sei g trades here for me it seems. Now I’m on posh
"That's for sure, of all my friends, no one sells this share and keeps it for a long time. According to analysts, the profit from this company will double this year, which means that the cost will also double."
"Just shaken the tree, the volume is lower than usual. There is a good reason that some of the big retail investment firms have buy recommendations on this company. Go figure !!!"
Strong company
Good luck all longs tomorrow.
So how many shares outstanding? 68M or 400M??
here comes another pop
So glad I didn't buy too much of this!
Soooon
"Just completed the valuation. In terms of comparable multiples, current price is fairly reflected, with only cap of $36.9 if Adj EBITDA multiple is used. DCF model shows $28.36. The company has too much debt burden, making it risky bet. The stock may go up, if Daily Active Users increases 50%."
"Facts- Compeny established in 20102011- $54 million revenue after Caesars bought them!2014- $549 million revenue 2015- $725 million revenue 2016 - Yunfeng Capital bought PLTK for 4.4B.And now the company is here, be patient!"
more and more bag holders
Playtika Holding is down 5.18% to 26.09
With actual revenue and with more people spending time playing on their devices this will be a growth stock. Buy it while it’s cheap. When the government releases additional stimulus money a lot of it will find its way into Robinhood accounts where young investors will become buyers.
Broken IPO
Wow the monster is awake ... Here comes the momo on time for the upcoming blockbuster first earnings report
Many analysts said 34 is overvalue... compare with peers e. g. Zynga... anyone think there is still room to go higher?
Here we go
What's going on?
SPCE is probably a better buy!
"Ok I’m back in this stock. I traded this so much from the ipo. Got out days before the offering. Grabbed 1000 shares, may be looking to add another 1000 tomorrow. My gut is telling me that the worst is over."

Not every day you have a chance to put your hands on a very profitable company that aim to be the best gaming company in the world and which just went public.
Back in.25.78 x 1000 shares.
great quarter. very bullish. might buy even more
"WOW!! crazy results, much more then i expected.Its gonna be GREAT day for pltk."
"Too many aggressive changes in some of their top grossing apps that are transparent attempts increase player monetization. As a result, the users are boycotting play and leaving in droves. Check out recent user reviews before investing."
Back to 32.00 not bad. I’m in at 32.50 x 200 shares.
"I think I’m about a 31.00 price average at this point, on 1000 shares. No complaints. Price prediction please this year or next? I’m thinking 75-100?"
Ebon neptBuddah the magnificent
Are we gonna see 50? 
Ok sell order in at 30.50 this morning 1/2 again 500 shares paid 30.36. Nothing for a profit. But time to move on and stop swing trading this one. Getting to tight. Hopefully it’ll fill. Still have 500 shares after. Down in that’s ok.
I’m out. Sold 2000 shares made 400.00. Too much downward pressure
This is following the same path as plantier and wish. I sold plantier a week too soon. And wish 6 hours too soon. This one here I’m gonna buy more next week and sit in it. My opinion it’ll double in less then a month.
3000 shares 24.47
Never short ipo buy buy buy

"The price has been updated to $27 but trading hadn’t started yet, I’m assuming it’ll start at noon"
Playtika stock is stuck between $29 and $30 a share recently.
New SEC filing form 3 and SC13G. Will go down in no time today. Market is red. Let it hit my longtime entrypoint @$25.
"The company will be the latest to benefit from the boom in games that we’ve seen as a result of the pandemic, where people have turned to play to engage in social-distanced fun and distract themselves from reality.For the 12 months ended September 30, Playtika generated $2.29 billion in revenues, $46.1 million in net income, and $815.2 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)."
"409M shares outstanding, average volume 900K. that's probably mean something. value is much higher then the current price."
All the people that think this stock is going to pop. I. Really would like to know what you are smoking!
Wow I’m getting crushed!
I was gonna sell the 1000 shares I just picked up today but I have fingered this company dry. I think I’m gonna hold the shares at this point to see what happens where they go.
Where did those $36 buyers go??

"PLTK should be getting some love.Playstudios Inc., an online game operator backed by casino giant MGM Resorts International, is going public via a $1.1 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company.The Las Vegas-based business, which offers free-to-play online blackjack and slot-machine games, said Monday it’s combining with Acies Acquisition Corp., a shell company founded last year. Acies’s chairman is Jim Murren, former chief executive officer of MGM. Bloomberg News reported on talks between the parties last week.Playstudios’ founder and CEO, Andrew Pascal, will continue in that role with the new company. Playstudios shareholders will receive $150 million in cash and own about 64% of the shares of the new entity.Institutional investors are putting $250 million into the business. Those investors include BlackRock Inc., Neuberger Berman Funds and MGM Resorts, which offers perks like free rooms to Playstudios players to build loyalty. MGM will own about 10% after its additional investment.As with most social online games, customers can opt to purchase an in-game currency to continue playing and reach higher levels. Playstudios’ twist is that they simultaneous earn points in the company’s own loyalty program, which can be traded in for real-world prizes like tickets to shows or discounted meals.The company plans to release a prerecorded investor presentation on Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. New York time.In an interview, Pascal, 55, said he’ll use the money raised through offering to grow the business.“We’ll now have the currency and capital to go acquire other companies and games,” he said."

Does anyone think that PLTK stock can go above $60 a share in the next 3 weeks?
They have over 35 million active users.
How much do you think the stock will reach after the reports are published? I think 45$ by the end of the month.
Sold I do not want to own this overnight. Let’s see what tomorrow brings. Market should be red
My feelings are getting hurt
Al most all shares that have been purchased today and not flipped are now losing money.
Gambling games... I thought it was videogames...
"What is the difference between this and SKLZ? I am not familiar with PLTK. Any help would be appreciated. Like all of us, just trying to make some money."
What a sell off!
This is a fun swing trade stock. But I have 500 shares tucked away that I won’t swing trade. I think I traded 2500 shares today. Waiting to buy again on the next dip. Funny thing is I’m still down overall becaose I refuse to swing trade 500 shares wow. I’m chasing the bottom amazing. I hope it does well.
Some big names cover this stock. Hope upgrades are coming.
Word is out.. next massive bonanza is pltk
Why did we start the day off? After the reports today should be a green day
Google and Apple slash developer payments from 30% to 15%. Will this affect PLTK? Anyone?
I hope to see green next week. I have 2000 shares. 1000 I would like to keep. I’m not down a ton about .40 but I’m swing trading to try to keep up with the decline stock! I hope to see a nice week next week
