You can't tell me this company is worth less than before the Google partnership. Buying May calls on Monday.
Bill Miller just noted ADT as a Top Pick on CNBC! Adjusting for financial risk
"Good call, Stock Trader. You were only one cent off. I feel we have gotten through the immediate resistance and hopefully, 7.50 can serve as support. The chart is turning. It was a good day."
"Load up and hold, wait for Google announcement of new tech implemented into ADT security."
"While Amazon's purchase of ring increases anxiety and I not really sure if it is any bad news for ADT, if it all it is a bad news. I think it increases the visibility of ADT further and as long as it can execute a competitive strategy well, it should benefit out of additional marketing ring/amazon does on this market segment. I am positive on ADT coming out of it stronger than before when all the dust settles.1. Clear Market Leader with Five Times the Market Share of the Next Largest Residential Competitor2. Majority of income is from ""Monitoring"" and related services (which ring doesn't have)3. Trusted by customers since 1874, the ADT brand is synonymous with security. (Not sure if Trust of ring would increase or decrease with Amazon having access to this data)4. Serves commercial customer (I do not think they are buying ring yet)Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703056/000119312518016233/d517732d424b4.htm"
"i haven't been doing this for long, but this was one of the first stocks I bought to go long on because I felt like it was so undervalued. Now that I'm thinking about it, this is a hardware plus subscription based business model which there are TONS of competitors in the market doing the same thing for cheaper. I think amazon's RING has a ""plug and play"" set up where you put the cameras and motion sensors wherever you want then pay $10 a month to have it monitors. ADT is the same thing but higher quality, wired equipment for 4x the monthly payment. It's going to be tough to convince people to not go the cheaper route when it comes to security. I think the play for them is to grow their commercial business and just maintain your residential side. What do you guys think?"
"After speaking with a Morgan Stanley broker.... I am convinced that ADT will be a $13, $15 and later a $19 stock. The reduction in debt, the elimination of the 9% preferred stock and the additional marketing they are doing to add more customers will be very positive for the stock. The results will speak for themselves!! Buy ADT "
"This will shoot up in the near future with its mobile integrated solutions. Has the largest deployment in US, will further extend it foothold with the next release."
"Sent this to InvestorsRelations@adt.com , I urge you to do the same. Please pass this to the Board of Directors:A deal with Amazon will create great shareholder value for ADT. Combining Amazon’s technology, recognition and the new Ring acquisition with ADT’s decades of experience in the alarm and security business will no doubt be a winning combination. Just... something to think about. I currently own 25,000 shares of ADT. Please confirm that this message was received, thank you."
ADT should be a safe haven in this market - stock should be attracting investors left and right. This may be more an indication of poor communications than anything.
"Bought ADT at $7.15 an additional 20,000 shares. Stay the course longs.... good news coming soon !!"
Thank god I didn’t buy it even though I use their services. It is painful to watch even for me. This reminds me of Sprint sometime back when it was in the 2-3.5 in early 2016. I want to see two weeks of stability before I would like to commit.
BOA Merrill Lynch reiterated buy with $10 target. The feeling is that the plan is intact. Adding fire safety capability through Red Hawk will be a win over time. Expecting Amazon Alexa Guard feature to launch 2nd quarter 2019. ADT also planning to launch it’s own DIY self-install offering in a few months to stave off the new start ups offering the same. This investment should work out over time. It should be much more attractive than it is with the strong cash flows... maybe an activist will step in at some point to get this moving....
"The only reason ADT sells Canada Assets is that Apollo needs some cash for other acquisitions. Think about it. Of $550M special dividend to be issued, $470M will go directly to Apollo. Not good for ADT long term and small investors."
Goldman Sachs analyst George Tong raised the firm's price target on ADT Inc. (ADT) to $17 from $9 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares.
bargain at this price
"ADT to jump to $17, solid fundamentals, statistics, millions of subscribers, additional orders in the pipeline, expanding in fastest growing emerging market, people need security ADT is the best."
Millions in debt and stock sinking in a market where almost every stock is up. Sub $11 a share is in its sight.

"$17 next week, time to get in"
ADT looking nice today... I loaded some 1/15/21 9.3$ calls... Google and ADT need to release this new platform for customers and really boost the morale
Revenue is the real thing. EPS is an accounting number.
"Relax longs... it’s not always up up, we might see $8.30 tomorrow."
6 Month chart look like a cup and handle break out.
Just came across an awesome ad for ADT on Zillow about there Free Video Door Bell. Starting to see them ramp up Advertising in the right spots and get the point across that they are the Real Deal - Not just an Internet sensation. The will monitor at any level you’d like and have live call centers with real people that have your back!
I sold a few hundred which means of course that it goes up here...still holding 500
Why is it down?
"interesting... $GOOG buys $ADT but ADT conversations are muted. Good luck everyone on the ride to the sky - something fishy going on with yahoo conversations - $NIO is also doing very well and their boards are muted as well. do your research, enjoy the ride."
Raising guidance. Good news.
It keeps going down. There has to be a reversal soon
We are a spitball away from the 52 week high. New investors will be coming in with the positive chart. Trend is positive and will continue to build as financial results back it up.
Tax selling might be finally over. Upward trend now
"Well I just bought another 5,000 shares... this is a great entry point at $8.15. ADT will soon be trading around it’s IPO price."
"ADT (ADT) NDR Highlights Strengthened Long Term Outlook - Goldman SachsMarch 22, 2021 7:50 AMGoldman Sachs analyst George Tong reiterated a Buy rating and $13.00 price target on ADT (NYSE: ADT) following a virtual non-deal roadshow with CEO, Jim DeVries, and CFO, Jeff Likosar.The analyst stated ""We believe ADT is well positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities, including strong new home construction trends and rising smart home demand, as it offensively steps up its subscriber acquisition costs by $150-250mn this year. With these investments, management plans to deliver accelerated mid-teens gross recurring monthly revenue additions growth in 2021. We expect ADT to increase its penetration of the fast growing smart home category longer-term with this incremental spend, particularly when combined with the ramping Google partnership."""
"Rob 88... I sure hope so. Look at CHK 65% in a month; FOSL 56% in one mint; Twtr 61% in a few months, etc and many more. Definitely I really think IPO price of $14 by end of August, but I hope your estimate is the Realty. Morgan Stanley has to save face with its investors and they will recommend it. Also the fact that ADT is doing well, I see their Vans all over. They are advertising heavy to increase their customer base. Recurring monthly payments is a great way to grow a business."
"What do you all see happening here short term? I like the recent jump, will it hold?"
Capitalisation 7.6BDebt is 9.7BThis is insanely overvalued stock
"Very last comment from Conference Call on Feb 26""So we feel good about the positioning of that business. And as I mentioned earlier, expect 2021 to be a really good year in commercial"" Jim DeVriesand then....this happensADT: SMAIL DAVID W (VP,LO,SEC) Bought (B) 7k Shares of ADT INC for $6.99 on 3/5 3/8/21ADT: DEVRIES JAMES DAVID (PR,CEO,DIR) Bought (B) 143k Shares of ADT INC for $7.13 on 3/5"
"2-3 weeks before earning always goes up and then crashes down, hope this is not the case again."
Wow I just read about all the insider trading activity around this when GOOGL announced an investment (or more accurately before they announced). Looks like they all took the money and ran as the stock is back down to just about where it was.
"CEO on cnbc stating their google intergrated products will be out next year, Google has a 7% stake, that's what the pop was today."
"From this threshold we go up, Uptrend appeared now."
https://discord.gg/bSqYftYb
"This will test 10.25 prior to earnings. It may break over, or stay right under- with the right earnings this can go to the moon."
pretty decent. stock will stay 7 dollars... no movement
"Very strong hold today, added more on the dip., It will fly in a couple of months when ADT/Google announces new upgrade to ADT home security and through 2021 as mentioned."
"Every low volume.... not that many shorts. This looks like a good entry point, purchase 10,000 share at $9.05 today. By next earnings we might see $12.50 to $13.25."
"This sell-off makes no sense. It's disproportionate to the increased percentage of shares. I bought a little more (If I wasn't worried that the market might know something, I'd have bought a lot)."
"Investing in security is a stock position that should definitely be on the rise. Protecting a family in times of crisis is an essential responsibility. In our current state, crimes are unfortunately sure to rise as desperate people take desperate actions. Security is not a luxury, especially in times when entire communities of people are facing desperate times!"
ex-div day today.
"-What a Solid Quarter !! Adt is working on all cylinders... I see it going back to its IPO price of $14 in weeks. And keep in mind that if Apple, Amazon or Google decide to purchase ADT this stock will be a $25 stock. The big boys are competing for the USA  Home . They want to have products in every home. Good luck longs... stay the course hold this baby till it hits $16.50."
if they are offering 5.5% if shares why was the sell off 15% .İt was 11.50 few days ago that's like 20% fall.
I just bought some at $7.62. I always see those ADT logos on the houses in rich neighborhoods. Let's see how it goes.
I am seeing a lot more buyers at $7.47 than sellers !! I really believe this is the reversal we were all waiting for.
ADT is solid company and long term investment. BUY
Buy low sell much higher. That is how anyone make money. Buy the trend. America is unsafe.
1 in 6 people in the US are filing for unemployment. Crime rises in desperate times. Would you rather have an ADT security system designed and installed to alert BEFORE they are inside your home or business or after they're already inside? Common sense says this stock should be on the rise if ADT can be proactive to market.
Can anyone explain what’s going on here ?
Keep saying ADT is going to run to $10. It will be taken private again if it doesn't get there fast. Then we open up to a new class of insty investors and can trade $10-$15. Show a quarter or 2 of improving results and we are trading $15 to $18. Easy to see a path to +$20
Added more @7.50 Thinking long-term on this one. Price target of $15
"Nice to see this finally getting back to where I expected. This is a good company with unique offerings and an infrastructure to support those offerings on a large scale. The lawsuit is clearly just a play by the rich who feel they were cheated out of their monthly entertainment expense since it only applies to people who lost over $100,000. It's called they made a bad investment decision, but no 1%er is capable of that so they must sue and blame someone! They'll show them! To the common investor that's a green light because you won't have to worry about them manipulating this stock since they felt cheated. Hoping for $10 in a month"
price target $15 by RBC
seems like ADT is breaking out.......undervalued stock
"Adt was down on Friday because Apollo Mgmt the controlling company had a small one time loss of $0.30, but yet top line growth was Up. So everyone panics. Earning for this 2nd quarter will beat, top line growth will improve and current monthly subscriber growth will increase. This might be a similar story as with Netflix that as long as subscriber growth is present in every quarter the stock goes up. Stay long ADT... my prediction is that it will Surprise and beat both top and bottom line this Wednesday. Soon it will be at the IPO price of $14.00. Apollo Management is a great company that knows what they are doing. Stay long ADT and you will be rewarded."
"$632 M net loss ? What kind of doorknobs could lose money on a business model with high margins and recurring revenue ? This is a poorly managed company. Flush the Board, and hire new top management."
Acquired largest dealer which increases cash flow for 2020! This could be a big move long term.
The announcement about the cellbounce acquisition closing should be a huge boost for the stock. The 3G sunset is a major issue for security companies because of the labor (truck roll) involved in replacing 3G radios with a traditional 4G replacement. This is a big advantage for ADT to have the cellbounce technology for their own replacements in addition to controlling it in the industry. This should be a big short term boost to the stock and the google product rollout will give it long term growth.
"Yes, definitely a great candidate for short squeeze and can go viral soon. And this company has strong fundamentals, which is why we are starting to see upward movement....."
Does anyone know when they announce earnings?
"Barclays downgrades to underweight, adjusts price target to $8 from $13."
1 words people. Cellbounce
"Yup, day by day. Might drop back down a bit every now and again but feel good that the trendline is heading up"
9 billion debt. classic case of company expanding at any cost to keep jobs.at some point this ends.
Let’s go
I just bought a bunch for two reasons. (A) past history shows that this will not go much lower than this. It might dip further but I betting it comes back by at least 20-30% over what I bought it for. And (B) I doubt that the company is going to go bankrupt any time soon.I think now is a good time to make a profit off of this.
bond yields rise a little. Lemming minions rush to sell stocks and buy bonds. Whackos.
Up .50 pre-market...what's up?
Everyone is buying self installed alarm systems like Ring. No one want to pay adt a monthly fee
I heard from a friend that they are in talks to be bought
"Someone asked me what my price target is for ADT. IMHO, I think it looks probable to close the gap...so $10.50 or so. I am holding."
"ADT will never give up cooking the books. ADT is still using nonstandard metrics that turn its loss into a tidy profit. Just three months after being rebuked and fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its use of nonstandard metrics in earnings, ADT Inc. is still pushing alternative numbers that change a sizable loss into a profit.The SEC fined the commercial and residential security company $100,000 and ordered it to cease and desist promoting nonstandard metrics in its earnings reports in December, after MarketWatch reported that its use of non-GAAP metrics — those that do not conform with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles — were confusing to investors.But the company is still using them and is now encouraging journalists to make a calculation to create a metric that the SEC has banned and that makes a loss look like a profit.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/adt-is-still-using-nonstandard-metrics-that-turn-its-loss-into-a-tidy-profit-2019-03-19"
DUDE Google bought in at an avg share price of $8.22. Let that sink in. Then Apollo raised their SPO at $10.00Can somebody look up what percentage of shares are being shorted in the float? FFS

Had a conversation with a Morgan Stanley broker concerning ADT. He told me to hang on to the stock because it will go up once they show the ability to grow the company. But most importantly he told me that Amazon would be a great candidate to buy ADT and accelerate their home  products. It’s a great fit for Amazon. They can buy ADT at a low price and add 4.3 billion to the top line and add about $1.10 to the bottom line in a years time. The big boys are competing for the us housing market and this is something to think about. Amazon buying ADT !!
I am in Monday for 2K shares. Watch this soar to $20 by end of March. For those in now Hold for gains. You will be glad you did
"ADT IPO price was $14.00 and now it’s at $7.40.... this is bottom. Today when I sell my position after hours in SYMC I will buy an additional 10,000 shares of ADT for long term. My fellow ADT long shareholders, do not panic stay long and by end of summer ADT will be back at its IPO price of $13 - $14. Stay the course !!"
$20 is coming. America is very unsafe
ADT was a great stock at $6.40. Shocked and bought on the way down. Almost back in the money. Thesis still holds - a perfect non-China play. Public markets give a proper valuation or it will LBO again. ADT is a cash machine. Sure there is debt but that is the LBO legacy. It will be paid down.
I have concern on their 10B debt. Where do they spend that money for?
Good luck all I’m in
"ADT surpassed my prediction of closing at $8.30. Folks I study the charts, volume, news and the timing of price increases. It’s was creasing up little by little and it you noticed whenever it went down it recover and marched the previous day high. This simply tells you that there is strong accumulation. Stay the course my friends this pos will make us money ."
Tomorrow is earnings day. Any thoughts?
The company says they are not selling any shares. The shares being offered are coming from the Apollo Group and certain senior individual stock holders. It appears the float will stay the same. Am I missing something?https://investor.adt.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Secondary-Public-Offering-of-ADT-Common-Stock-Launched/default.aspx

New ceo coming! Good news!
Gets scary cheap.. should I buy ?
$9 and Short Squeeze and push over $10 - may be a face ripping move up tomorrow - wonderful for longs that have been buying the painful whole way down - glad that's over!
Security of a building can be part of the PPP loan forgiveness computation. Paying this utility cost will be included in forgiveness amounts and would hope ADT is communicating this to businesses that may be closed or struggling but currently protecting their assets with ADT security.
"How does ADT, and peers like Vivint and Monitronics, survive without local police free-on-demand for millions of their deterrent alarm customers. When ADT cannot deliver as promised, customers get mad and go away, or litigate."
market up market down ADT always down. 50% in 3 mo. What gives with this googl relationship
Any idea why the nice move up at open? I am a patient long and thankful I was able to build a sizable position under $5. Continue to see the stock on a run to $10 for year end. It will be taken private again if it doesn't move.
Earnings for 2021 could exceed $1.00/share if forecasts are accurate. GLTA
Going up when new google collaborated products come up by summer. Mark it.

"Thinking we'll wrap up the week around where we opened today, just over $8. Feel very pleased with that as our start going into next week and wouldn't be surprised to see another $.25-.30 gain next week. It always seemed to rebound fairly slow and cautious but it'll happen"
What a #$%$ company this is. How can they call this company a leader in the industry. I guess they mean a leader in a loosing way. It's time for a new CEO. Maybe they have a job for him in the maintenance department cleaning toilets because that's where he's taking this company
John Rogers on Squawk Box this morning saying they think this could be a double to $16.
I agree. 8.05 on the horizon and pre-earnings levels shortly after. I think 8.20 will spark the rebound
Is it down because of poor earnings? I am not seeing anything yet. Hoping for news on google collaboration.
I hope they confirm when they release new google product. This should be trading at $10 with googl owning 9.9% of company
in at $12.50 who knows...
"I have faith in ADT. The company was originally founded about 150 years ago and still in business with over 20 thousand employees. Look, the stock price is up even though it reported little loss as per Zacks for 2021 Q1."
ADT upgraded at Deutsche Bank on Google solution potential from $8 to $10.
ADT will be over $20 by next year. Very confident about it. Bought 1000 shares today. I buy the trend of unsafe environment across America
Anyone buying before earnings?
Wow... ADT Partners with Confese to provide businesses syber Security!!Excellent combination and that will add to bottom line in the future.
time for a new CEO. the guy is dragging this company down.
"Starting to love the share price of this for initial entry. There are a lot of opportunities on the horizon with ADT both retail and commercial sides of business. Security is a growing concern, and especially after a bad event has occurred at a home or business. People seem to be more and more crafty these days and I think i really takes a security expert to help minimize risk and these guys have been at for a while with a good name an rep. GLTA."
"Guess I was early. There is a lot of resistance at 7.5, but it was moving so nicely, I thought it would break through. Maybe next week."
ANALYST UPDATE: Merrill Lynch reiterates buy with $11 price objective. Any others this morning?
I do think ADT did a great job with their Super Bowl ad. Good for the brand. I'm in the security business and it was one of the first things I've seen them come out with that made me think - YES!
Anybody knows what is going on with ADT in the last 30 minutes of marketclose? Any acquisition rumors? It just jumped over 12%!!!!!
Price action interesting. What gives? 3rd time's the charm???
"I just bought more and now have a lot, for me, of ADT. I am hoping that with the help of Google, ADT can make enough progress to justify $12 or more a share. After loading up on ADT, a friend told me that there is now significant new competition for ADT so buying ADT is a bad idea. Please, someone, reassure me."
"ADT now is GOOGLE 7%. Google is needing expansion business in different field, costumers, etc. ADT have all things google need. Google can buy out ADT at anytime. But I don't expected ADT sell it 140 years old company. For sure, ADT must in double digits soon, possible $20's."
Trading volume picking up with huge short interest here. Something is going on as there has been no real news to justify recent pop in the stock price...
We need some updates on the google partnership and product line
Took a substantial position yesterday and today.
I hope this is the beginning of an uptrend
"With a good ER next week, we can get back to $7.50"
I like this stock and it's business looks solid as I see it. Security is needed more and more and their services are great!!
"nothing to worry about, buy on the dip"
I got a lotta stocks in the 8s and this one performed great today comparatively...AND coming off a huge day...good signs
Expect a Beat and Raise quarter. Probability they blow this is low. Stock will run coming out of earnings. Look to trade through $9 as we move through the week.
"Look closely at ADT this week...it will explode. Mark my words, in the not-so-distant future ONLY positive news for this meteoric company. It is bewildering how suddenly this past year it has made such big moves that can only continue to propel this company into the future. Exciting stuff! !"
https://discord.gg/5ycJFs3
This stock 5 yr chart is really sad. Why buying something that just goes down ?
"Last time ADT made the Google announcement and the stock jumped to $16.... And then, nothing happened. If they keep making announcement like that without follow-up results, it could warrant a slew of Securities Class action lawsuits from investors, so it is a slipper slope in my opinion. This is a dead horse at the current price and I am buying puts on it."
"Buy Buy Buy it’s screaming here,Potential 150% reward with max risk of 25% I wish I could more shares now"
Robinhood is now taking ADT trades
ADT going up and volume increasing !! We might close around $7.75 today.
"Adt might close over $8.00 today. Slowly creeping up, and it should be at IPO price of $14.00 after next Earnings."
14 by next week
"Yep, Google probably helping. Also, stocks with significant short ratios are in favor these days."
15 AH after they report earnings.
"Commercial biz is the future!ADT is rapidly expanding in the commercial security and monitoring market. This has occurred through M&A growth and organic growth. The company has made numerous smaller acquisitions and the larger Red Hawk Fire & Security acquisition. Red Hawk provides a scalable national platform to expand. In this regard, ADT landed its first sales win with large retailer with 1,400 stores. Commercial revenue (not including small business) now accounts for about 19% of revenue. In Q1 2019 organic commercial revenue grew 8% to $142M from $132M on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the company added about $80M of commercial revenue from M&A. Commercial customers have higher installation revenue, greater monthly revenue per site, lower attrition and lower customer revenue payback time periods when compared to residential customers as see in the chart below. It is likely that ADT will continue expanding in the commercial market. This will drive further increases in revenue and cash flow."
"What I see is shorts trying to drive the market down and buyback at low, explains the heavy fluctuation aftermarket."
ADT vehicle monitoring would be cool. Imagine they partner with Tesla? ADT stock would go off the charts.
Seems like this was a pump and dump scheme so far. Share is no where near the original pump price when they announced google partnership
This is alarming
How did ADT accumulate so much debt
Good news today.
Thank you shorts! For allowing me to increase my position with the dip!
Home Security Company ADT Betting on Google Partnership to Build Revenue
"Defenders founder David P. Lindsey and Jessica A. Lindsey received approximately 16.3 million shares of ADT common stock for 100% of their ownership in Defenders, while the remaining $260 million of consideration was paid in cash to retire existing Defenders debt, fund other liabilities, and pay transaction expenses. Owners of Defenders received ZERO cash so it would make sense that they are selling a relatively large number of shares in the open market. Could explain why we are going down and w/o any additional info , a buying op.I added about 20%"
Buy all the dips 
This is the biggest #$%$ I own .
ADT always beats earnings. Expect big this this afternoon. Average price target is still around $12
nice 7 dollars.
I wonder what new products will be coming from the innovation team. A ring type product would give this stock a big boost!
"Mark my word,Before August we will be over $15 for share"
"Beware, new ADT Command and Control System is no where near ADT Pulse. I just had one installed today and it’s junk. Doesn’t have capability to monitor ADT cameras on the touch screen like Pulse. Customer reaction is negative and cancellations are going to increase. I’m done with system. Transition has taken them backwards from a technology standpoint."
"Once ADT eliminates the $750,000,000 of preferred stock in June... earnings for the 3rd Qtr will automatically increase by $0.095 to $0.10 cents per share. Here is what the CEO said:2018 begins with a strong first quarter with positive momentum across all areas of the business. We delivered on our 5 financial targets: increasing revenue by 5% year-over-year, increasing EBITDA by 7%, reducing our payback period on new customers and reducing our customer attrition by 90 basis points, all of which led to free cash flow generation of $187 million. Jeff will speak in greater detail about financial performance in a moment.In the quarter, we continued to strengthen our foundation for growth. Our commercial team had their best month of sales since the P1 ADT merger. This excludes any M&A results. We were also able to expand our talent and capabilities in the commercial space with the Aronson and Acme acquisitions. We also launched our ADT Go app in Q1, extending security from the premise to the individual, and we kicked off our e-commerce initiative to be launched later in 2018."
"Sold all my QS to buy more ADT. Smart move on my part. I actually congratulated myself. Made huge profits on QS and able to buy cheap ADT shares,"
"Another home security company listing sometime this week I believe. ARLO. Could be a potential catalyst for investors to revisit the potential of the security market. ADT could benefit, we shall see."
I can see Google/ADT smart security sentry speakers selling 10's of millions in this De Police era
back down to where we were before paternship was announced. good opportunity to buy back now
"REPLY TO: “America is unsafe….”. “ADT upside potential is undeniable….” Remember, ADT and peers are only one half of a solution.... and the other half is out of their control. ADT market value has been seriously diluted, NOT enhanced. The other half of the solution for millions of deterrent alarm customers is meaningful “site-response” by public or private police… now unavailable for most ADT deterrent systems. For several years the public police have been pulling away from this private service for millions of existing customers. Formally an asset, now a liability. The pandemic, combined with political and social unrest, is demanding the “repurpose” of these 100 year old business models. Source: Lee Jones; Support Services Group"

$15 in a couple weeks
Even without the Google deal this was a $10 stock. Earnings after market should take it higher. But the markets rigged so who knows
"Insider buying, amazing catalyst, and a great product. Should be at 13 as Goldman Sachs says."
"Before election  fear of unrest makes ADT demand up, with Google Next it will be a smarter choice. Fear of Ron Paul suggested recession will create big demand. ADT go up from here."
sold at 11.22. Will by back in under 8
"Great earnings, holding for long term till it goes up to $20, it will go up, little bit of bumps are ok........."
Patnership with google last quarter. New strategic partnership with dish and others expanding their client base. New line of products to offer new and existing clients for home security. Subscription base model. These are the reason I own ADT.
coming back in a year with hopefully $12 + share price
It is amazing how the stock price can be manipulated
"are there any negative news , or shorts just came in that drag it down? while market up 300 points. wth!"
Remember that ADT is not affected with Trade Wars or Other Worldwide Financial Crisis!! Great company to invest during these volatile times. And paying approx. 2% dividend. ADT is a safe bet... we will see the IPO price better the end of summer.
"Hold on to your position until the IPO ends, which is probably Tuesday or late Monday. It will slowly shoot up after that. Home security is necessity these days. There are sure lot's of local competitors but no one is more recognized and reliable than ADT."
I own it for a buyout at 13-15 from AMZN why not they are in the business and have no problem buying scale as in whole foods
"I am happy to have bought in this dip. stock will see 7,000 buy the end of the week."
Good morning to Longs today! Goldman Sachs reiterates its $10 target
CEO WAS ON CNBC SAYING HOME AUTOMATION IS GROWING....
"The games that market makers play... this is sad , that people have to resort to these kind of games ."
"Every time a stock reaches 52-week high some Fund sells their 400,000 then they downgrade the stock, make it drop by 25% then they buy another 500,000 and upgrade it to pocket 35% for the following year. This stock manipulation is getting too old and too obvious."
I bought shares a couple days ago when I saw the CEO on CNBC. They are partnering with Google and will be strongly competing with ring. This is a no brainer. Buy before it explodes.
"ADT is headquartered in South Florida, and with mid-Florida is the fast growing housing market in the country with ADT added to new homes for security and for operation of connected systems."
RING AND NEST HAVE BEEN ISSUED FBI WARNING....... THIS MAYBE GOOD FOR ADT.....GOOGLE BEING A 6.6% OWNER OF ADT WILL HELP ADT IN THIS ISSUE..
"With Democrats in charge, defunding of police and the violence in urban areas from BLM, ADT is going to be a riser. Similar to weapons, ammunition suppliers and other home security stocks, these will go up. I would question how much law enforcement related companies will rise in the current political climate."
Isn’t this one of Bill Miller’s big picks?
"Upside potential is undeniable. Earnings will likely catapult it past 20, foregone conclusion imo"
"IMPRESSIVE: When a customer enables Alexa Guard on their Amazon Echo device and says “Alexa, I’m leaving,” Alexa will notify the customer if she detects the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms or breaking glass while the customer is away."
Love to see 9 by end of the week!
Alot of Volatility today but I really like the investment at these share prices. It’s a long term hold. With a price target of 40. So alot of potential upside. Key is to put out earnings a few times and Give the market some comfort!
This company is in the right space at the right time. Too bad the market doesn't see it that way. Just gotta hold.
Morgan Stanley out with positive commentary on ADT. 84% recurring revenue minimal China impact if supply chain component sourcing becomes an issue - but recurring revenue outweighs on the upside.
ADT - mostly Tariff proof; crime is everywhere; DIY floodlights and doorbells are no replacement for full house coverage and monitoring. And YES monitoring is well worth the monthly fee.
"purchased 25,000 Shares @ 9.15 projected to achieve 15% Return within 48 hours Sell at $10.5 to $11.00 Good luck!"
Wsb reddit is all talking Adt short squeeze
Mark this post... ADT will eventually be pushed to $17 - $20. Read this:https://m.benzinga.com/article/11185083
#ADT Strong Buy!I believe ADT will hit $20 soon after great earning report tomorrow! Very undervalued stock!
Amazed more haven't bought in. Nice dip.
Anyone know the FLOAT....I bought ROKU when it IPOed at $17....Looking for another winner...Thanks
"ADT recommended long term by Bill Miller and Samantha McLemore, Managers of his flagship Miller Opportunity Trust fund which has beaten the market and its mutual fund competitors since the market bottom in 2009."
I think we'll see an uptick.
"ADT is RIPE for an activist. 84% recurring revenue. Put a more effective, OpEx focused CFO and CEO in place and drive cash flow and margins. Easy double. Hope the Board is enjoying sitting on its hands and cashing its checks. The clock is ticking."
Maybe analysts are now understanding the risk/reward of this type of subscription revenue. Lots of revenue projected forward suggests lots of revenue/earnings clawed back to follow attrition... ADT attrition above industry norm.
Great time to buy ADT right now with all the riots and especially since it’s going through a correction
What am I missing here ? A lot of debt ? Looks like a buy at this level.
FB opened at $40.. dropped down to $19... sitting well over $150 now... relax Microwave society 
Oh boy. I sure hope I can buy some puts before the bottom drops out of this
I'm in at $7.27. done my research and its a no brainer. Good Luck everyone
"ADT Needs a new CFO, CEO and IR. They cannot communicate to investors. They have NO support. There is not buy-in on a long-term strategy. There is no perceived value in the business. The RIGHT CEO & CFO would have this trading at a premium. They own the market. Huge competitive barriers. There are countless examples of companies getting it right - look at BBBY - left in the dumpster and a new CEO has been killing it; AMD - on deaths door - went from $2 to +$80. On and On. The ADT team is horrible. Time for change."
GOOD EARNINGS
I LIVE IN A CONDO in Bradenton Fla... Some people are putting ADT systems in their place & the condo association is sending us notices to vote for more enhanced security around the whole place.... There is a movement... I got 2200 shares at $8.07... I think i need to average up....
I work for the company and I got shares at $14. This is only going to go up. When we sold last time is was worth $42 a share.
This Company has no current assets and $13 billion of Goodwill which a significant part will most likely need to be written off due to Company unable to make a profit
..quite the move today from around 7.92 to 8.53 by after hours... cannot find any news as to why
Anyone have any idea what to do with this stock after I lost $2.5 for share keep it or sale it ???
ADT Q2 earnings call today after market closes.EPS 0.29 expectedRevenue 1.25B expected
Love this Company; Think the Stock has far more upside than downside; CFO and CEO have no clue how to manage investors or the Street
I'm new to this message board and entered at $9.52. I'm hopeful that ADT will be at $17 by the end of April.
What’s going on with the premarket rise?
Somebody please call Bill Miller.
What is happening hereCan anyone explain?
So if they defund the police like they want how does that help ADT out if the police don’t show up when my alarm goes off for a break in...
I need it to hit $9 to break even what can this company offer me besides name recognition and a shareholder class action lawsuit?
"""Wall Street expects EPS of $0.29 and sales around $1.28 billion."""
"If we touch $10 today, I take it all back the stuff I said about management and the board"
"We believe the current profile of ADT makes it extremely difficult for Apollo to exit its 75% of ADT, without a big loss. Because “plausible deniability” no longer applies. They now have to disclose the big piece of ADT subscription revenue, existing and future, in jeopardy of high customer attrition related to a legacy liability and negative PR. Such as… low priority or no police response to the alarm site of millions of customers, ie big hole in “security” as trending for many years, but not disclosed in existing SEC documents….”. ADT adding “shiny new toys”, like Dish and Google, cannot hide this important disruption."
Yes.. now is the waiting until the climb. I do believe it's inevitable. Just a question of when
Don’t underestimate the new products coming and Amazon will push ADT to do more bc competition is good for everyone!
Private equity company comes and takes private at $10 a share - then take the cash flow to the bank and lives large
"Great beginning for the day. Hope it sustains.11.060+0.380 (+3.558%)As of 9:57AM EST. Market openWith the ability of ADT to connect/work with Ring, Ring need not necessarily eat into ADThttps://www.adt.com/help/faq/equipment/ring-video-doorbell"
I bought at Google announcement. Only to watch it drop while I consistently averaged down. Sitting on 20k shares at 8.90 average. Not buying anymore. I might average down if it goes in 6 range or if uptrend happens. Risk risk risk
We gone close this week at $8.70
Offering is for renewing the loan. don't be misled.
Bullish long term!
"Here is what the CEO said:“We continue to build momentum and are off to a strong start in our first quarter operating as a public company,” said Tim Whall, ADT’s Chief Executive Officer. “This quarter we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow. Operationally, we continued to execute on our commitment to enhance our customer service capabilities and implement operational improvements. As a result, we lowered attrition to a new all-time low of 13.6% and improved revenue payback. I am pleased with our first quarter results and our management team is excited to continue executing our strategy to drive free cash flow growth and create long-term shareholder value.”"

With this housing boom more and more people will be getting home security systems. And ADT is what people know.
Finally this is going towards its actual price of $15
Time to move up to $10
Bill Miller on CNBC today - positive comments on ADT- says low risk.
You can see $14 tomorrow.
"A filing with the SEC revealed that on Monday, Director Andrew Africk bought 130,000 shares of ADT, for a cost of $7.46 each, for a total investment of $969,921. Hey anyone can buy ADT cheaper than this director’s price."
Just did so myself at 7.07. Seems like a real value buy to me. Even if their reporting was questionable... this is America! That's pretty much how things roll so not sure why anyone would even bat any eye at it long term
Can they finally deliver a good ER in May? We shall see!!!!
