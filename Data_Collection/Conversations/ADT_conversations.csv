Raising guidance. Good news.
John Rogers on Squawk Box this morning saying they think this could be a double to $16.
"JUST SAW ADT HEALTH CARE ALERT TV COMMERCIAL..... So , ADT & GOOG have plans after all...."
I need it to hit $9 to break even what can this company offer me besides name recognition and a shareholder class action lawsuit?
Can't believe even AAA has entered the security market. AAA is more into auto insurance and Tolling but now wants to enter home security market.
"ADT Needs a new CFO, CEO and IR. They cannot communicate to investors. They have NO support. There is not buy-in on a long-term strategy. There is no perceived value in the business. The RIGHT CEO & CFO would have this trading at a premium. They own the market. Huge competitive barriers. There are countless examples of companies getting it right - look at BBBY - left in the dumpster and a new CEO has been killing it; AMD - on deaths door - went from $2 to +$80. On and On. The ADT team is horrible. Time for change."
Goldman Sachs analyst George Tong raised the firm's price target on ADT Inc. (ADT) to $17 from $9 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares.
"Very strong hold today, added more on the dip., It will fly in a couple of months when ADT/Google announces new upgrade to ADT home security and through 2021 as mentioned."
New ceo coming! Good news!
"Defenders founder David P. Lindsey and Jessica A. Lindsey received approximately 16.3 million shares of ADT common stock for 100% of their ownership in Defenders, while the remaining $260 million of consideration was paid in cash to retire existing Defenders debt, fund other liabilities, and pay transaction expenses. Owners of Defenders received ZERO cash so it would make sense that they are selling a relatively large number of shares in the open market. Could explain why we are going down and w/o any additional info , a buying op.I added about 20%"
Finally this is going towards its actual price of $15
"$632 M net loss ? What kind of doorknobs could lose money on a business model with high margins and recurring revenue ? This is a poorly managed company. Flush the Board, and hire new top management."
"Insider buying, amazing catalyst, and a great product. Should be at 13 as Goldman Sachs says."
"Time for a short squeeze on this one, its partnership with google is going to pay huge dividends $ADT"
I bought shares a couple days ago when I saw the CEO on CNBC. They are partnering with Google and will be strongly competing with ring. This is a no brainer. Buy before it explodes.
"Commercial biz is the future!ADT is rapidly expanding in the commercial security and monitoring market. This has occurred through M&A growth and organic growth. The company has made numerous smaller acquisitions and the larger Red Hawk Fire & Security acquisition. Red Hawk provides a scalable national platform to expand. In this regard, ADT landed its first sales win with large retailer with 1,400 stores. Commercial revenue (not including small business) now accounts for about 19% of revenue. In Q1 2019 organic commercial revenue grew 8% to $142M from $132M on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the company added about $80M of commercial revenue from M&A. Commercial customers have higher installation revenue, greater monthly revenue per site, lower attrition and lower customer revenue payback time periods when compared to residential customers as see in the chart below. It is likely that ADT will continue expanding in the commercial market. This will drive further increases in revenue and cash flow."
"ADT is RIPE for an activist. 84% recurring revenue. Put a more effective, OpEx focused CFO and CEO in place and drive cash flow and margins. Easy double. Hope the Board is enjoying sitting on its hands and cashing its checks. The clock is ticking."
The company says they are not selling any shares. The shares being offered are coming from the Apollo Group and certain senior individual stock holders. It appears the float will stay the same. Am I missing something?https://investor.adt.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Secondary-Public-Offering-of-ADT-Common-Stock-Launched/default.aspx
"Well I am back in at $7.95 for a good 10,000 shares. Let’s see what happens."
Maybe analysts are now understanding the risk/reward of this type of subscription revenue. Lots of revenue projected forward suggests lots of revenue/earnings clawed back to follow attrition... ADT attrition above industry norm.
"Every time a stock reaches 52-week high some Fund sells their 400,000 then they downgrade the stock, make it drop by 25% then they buy another 500,000 and upgrade it to pocket 35% for the following year. This stock manipulation is getting too old and too obvious."
The announcement about the cellbounce acquisition closing should be a huge boost for the stock. The 3G sunset is a major issue for security companies because of the labor (truck roll) involved in replacing 3G radios with a traditional 4G replacement. This is a big advantage for ADT to have the cellbounce technology for their own replacements in addition to controlling it in the industry. This should be a big short term boost to the stock and the google product rollout will give it long term growth.
"Barclays downgrades to underweight, adjusts price target to $8 from $13."
"Adt was down on Friday because Apollo Mgmt the controlling company had a small one time loss of $0.30, but yet top line growth was Up. So everyone panics. Earning for this 2nd quarter will beat, top line growth will improve and current monthly subscriber growth will increase. This might be a similar story as with Netflix that as long as subscriber growth is present in every quarter the stock goes up. Stay long ADT... my prediction is that it will Surprise and beat both top and bottom line this Wednesday. Soon it will be at the IPO price of $14.00. Apollo Management is a great company that knows what they are doing. Stay long ADT and you will be rewarded."
"Very last comment from Conference Call on Feb 26""So we feel good about the positioning of that business. And as I mentioned earlier, expect 2021 to be a really good year in commercial"" Jim DeVriesand then....this happensADT: SMAIL DAVID W (VP,LO,SEC) Bought (B) 7k Shares of ADT INC for $6.99 on 3/5 3/8/21ADT: DEVRIES JAMES DAVID (PR,CEO,DIR) Bought (B) 143k Shares of ADT INC for $7.13 on 3/5"
Just did so myself at 7.07. Seems like a real value buy to me. Even if their reporting was questionable... this is America! That's pretty much how things roll so not sure why anyone would even bat any eye at it long term
Is it down because of poor earnings? I am not seeing anything yet. Hoping for news on google collaboration.
"ADT IPO price was $14.00 and now it’s at $7.40.... this is bottom. Today when I sell my position after hours in SYMC I will buy an additional 10,000 shares of ADT for long term. My fellow ADT long shareholders, do not panic stay long and by end of summer ADT will be back at its IPO price of $13 - $14. Stay the course !!"
"I just bought more and now have a lot, for me, of ADT. I am hoping that with the help of Google, ADT can make enough progress to justify $12 or more a share. After loading up on ADT, a friend told me that there is now significant new competition for ADT so buying ADT is a bad idea. Please, someone, reassure me."
"interesting... $GOOG buys $ADT but ADT conversations are muted. Good luck everyone on the ride to the sky - something fishy going on with yahoo conversations - $NIO is also doing very well and their boards are muted as well. do your research, enjoy the ride."
"Investing in security is a stock position that should definitely be on the rise. Protecting a family in times of crisis is an essential responsibility. In our current state, crimes are unfortunately sure to rise as desperate people take desperate actions. Security is not a luxury, especially in times when entire communities of people are facing desperate times!"
"CEO on cnbc stating their google intergrated products will be out next year, Google has a 7% stake, that's what the pop was today."
"A filing with the SEC revealed that on Monday, Director Andrew Africk bought 130,000 shares of ADT, for a cost of $7.46 each, for a total investment of $969,921. Hey anyone can buy ADT cheaper than this director’s price."
Trading volume picking up with huge short interest here. Something is going on as there has been no real news to justify recent pop in the stock price...
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
Anyone have any idea what to do with this stock after I lost $2.5 for share keep it or sale it ???
I'm new to this message board and entered at $9.52. I'm hopeful that ADT will be at $17 by the end of April.
ADT was a great stock at $6.40. Shocked and bought on the way down. Almost back in the money. Thesis still holds - a perfect non-China play. Public markets give a proper valuation or it will LBO again. ADT is a cash machine. Sure there is debt but that is the LBO legacy. It will be paid down.
Going up when new google collaborated products come up by summer. Mark it.
"purchased 25,000 Shares @ 9.15 projected to achieve 15% Return within 48 hours Sell at $10.5 to $11.00 Good luck!"
