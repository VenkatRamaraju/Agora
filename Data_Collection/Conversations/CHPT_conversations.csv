The lower it gets the more I accumulate…. Love it!
Dilution? Nope. Charge point are selling upto 5.7m shares on the market - In other words selling THEIR own shares onto the market which is NOT dilution - FACT.. They could be freeing up money for a possible acquisition. Trust in the management.Feeling more bullish than ever. Hoping for a decent dip so I can buy up more of this gem.
finally get in with 350 share at 17.9. I hope it will never go lower than today.
"So, it is crashing again…"
"This is an excellent speculative long-term play. On paper, no-brainer. Watching execution closely.Got in yesterday @ 19.84 x 1000 shares. Will be watching and adding (or not) appropriately."
"There has been a massive market rotation out of growth for the last couple months. It is NOT only CHPT that has been getting beat down. I watch dozens of lower cap growth stocks everyday and they behave exactly the same since June. This is normal market behavior and it is healthy. If you can position yourself to exploit the upside when the next rotation into growth happens, then do it. I have significant exposure in this sector along with a lot of lower risk value exposure. It hurts me as well, but just average down and exploit the upside. It WILL happen. Just dont get frustrated and bored out of it. Hang in there!"
I threw in 30k today. but I have serious doubts now about the infrastructure bill getting passed.
The future for this company is likely not in charger sales but in fleet management.
Lmdao how is this green?? I own 1000 shares but I can’t help but laugh. It’s my only green stock
I bought some at $18.10
"more charging is not the answer to EV adoption, better batteries are -> ""Most new EVs today go for 200+ miles on one charge - generally much much more than enough for a daily commute. By 2022, the average EV range is estimated to be 275 miles and by 2028, 400 miles."""
It's much better to buy a quality stock closer to ATHs than ATLs... Just FYI.
Reuters rocking down electric avenue article 13 Oct. We know who the world leader is.
"Add before the boom  Debt ceiling raisedInfrastructure bill passes$35+ “Is it too late to buy?” Buy when everyone is fearful, classic market manipulation going on,  loading up"
4th time in the last 6 months that $20 has held as support.
I made a side bet with CantLose a while back I say we see $30 before $5. What you think?
"sell your shares pay your capital gains tax feed a border crosser, beautiful makes you feel warm and fuzzy all over."
"I'm no businessman but when the entire US population is driving EVs in 20 years, I think the companies that charge those 400M+ vehicles will be relevant..."
at least we can all quit pretending $20/share is some sort of resistance level...
CHPT is far too cheap.... never thought I would be buying more at tthis prices.... Thank you CHPT.... got more now please climb...
Incredible buying opportunity today!!! loaded up with 1500 shares for now...
its not overbe patient 
Sept. 26…CFO has recently sold large quantity of his personal shares along with another insider. Hmmm!? Source: Simply wall st.
learn from history short the open
Why falling AH?
Great time to add to position!! With rapid expansion throughout the whole world with or without infrastructure bill stock will rally HIGHER!!
it seems to me the chargepoint officer that sold just about all his shares it's like the captain of the Titanic get in the first Lifeboat out and let all the passengers fend for themselves.
In Toronto today for work. Charge point stations everywhere!
We knew a sale had to come as part of payment for recent acquisitions.
CHPT is now my largest holding because of yesterday's drop. Meaning it had officially surpassed my HYLN holdings and I FN love me some Hyliion. 9500 shares now under $20 average. Let's Go!!!
for those shorties Thank U and will ever thank U again for tanking CHPT coz im buying loads and loads every tume you short them hahahha
"They keep dumping their bags on us , and we're plunging again, there's no impulsion , nothing. might as well leave that sinking ship"
Oh how the momentum has changed! It’s hard to stop momentum once it gets rolling! It also shuts up the shorts! This is just get getting started! Anything under $20 is a steal!
Price target  is 50 $ I’ll never sale before that
still negotiating the bill it will be trimmed but EV Charging will stay intact. You will then buy in at a higher price.
Can someone tell me what is causing today selloff they haven’t voted on the infrastructure bill yet so I don’t understand why were selling off so hard￼
This is just one of the best ways to play the EV sector.This is a steal at these prices!
.........ENDLESS SHARE DILUTION.........
What a great time to buy
$20 we did it boys!! Take that CantLose lol
Lets break through 20 and bulls regain control
What is everyone's average price?
Lots bag holders in the 40s.
This company will be bought out by Shell or Chevron sometime in the future!
"Buying today will be a bad idea , wait until Monday."
get in at 17.9 and got a nice gain each day. I will not leave at least before 36.
"Looks like it could be one of those ""BUY THE DIP!!"" days."
I expect 35 USD upcoming days!!!
Friday is always a good day to remember that if CHPT isnt the worst stock you own you should stop investing. In my 30 years of investing it has never been easier to make $ than 2021.
All EVs are in red except this one. Imagine what happens on a green market day. Glad I bought more earlier this week!
"I think the issue here is valuation. While they have great earnings, they still don’t make the revenues that warrant the market cap of $6.4B. Reality is the future revenues can only be upto $235M eoy. They will first have to prove that they will continue to grow revenues each qtr and then eventually it’s market cap can be justifiable. I don’t see why this continues to tank given a great ER."
"FANTASTIC news... every short, every negative poster is out trying to dish this today...... that means they are worried.... holding my 4825 shares (£71K) of shares and looking forward to this creeping towards $30 per share by the end of the yr........"
Good things will happen soon!!
Back in the the GREEN with CHPT with room to run!!! Now just need to get HYLn going frim alltime lows and I'm golden.
Added 3K more at $19.10.
Can t wait to see Cantlose telling us again why he’s the next Warren Buffet.
guys now I'm losing money. it's not funny anymore
DO ME A FAVOR AND GOOGLE CHARGEPOINT charging station NEAR ME. EV CHARGING STATIONS TAKING OVER BIG TIME. EVERY CAR MAKER IS COMING OUT WITH NEW EV’s AND PEOPLE ARE LOVING IT. GET IN EARLY ON THE LEADING EV CHARGING COMPANY THAT CONTROLS 75% OF THE MARKET SHARE.

The barriers to entry are minimal, chargers themselves require no technological innovation and chpt has few patents or competitive differentiators. the current valuation assumes an exponential revenue growth curve, you are not coming in early with chpt, you are buying into a set of assumptions about the future that are required to actualize to support current valuation (revenue will grow exponentially and that charging needs are linearly correlated to the EV growth curve (and nothing in infrastructure works that way)).i dont think it will play out as assumed. i think batteries will become lighter, cheaper, charge faster and ranges will extend. most will recharge at their homes and ranges will more than support daily commuting. we need more charging, but it will be commoditized, low margine, infrastructure.CantLoseCantLose23 hours agoReplied to a reactionChargePoint Holdings, Inc.@bert i am saying it is ill advised to try and ""time the bottom"" on a declining trend, you will miss the bottom by waiting for an established reversal but it is safer.

Now it going to 16s
Hats off to those who bought the 19.8 dip last Friday!That support level is very strong and it bounced off that level 4 times now.Now let's get this above 21.60 to confirm breakout!
"Infrastructure Bill Thursday, by Friday 25%+ "
Where do people realistically see the share price in 2025?
Cantlose has over 800 reactionsHe is devoted to CHPT
"This just in...CarsTop 20 Plugin Electric Vehicles in the World — August 2021ByJosé PontesPublished 8 hours ago Global plugin vehicle registrations were up 114% in August 2021 compared to August 2020, scoring 516,000 units (or 7.7% share of the overall auto market). That made it the plugin market’s third best month ever, and expect September to be another record month.So tell me how a charging company with 70% market share won't become the most vital cog in the EV industry?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
This company have all the ingredients to be huge. Holding for 10 years minimum. Could be a multi bagger. Maybe 20x if EV really gets going
"It's just the lockup that expires today, look what happend to Lucid after the lockup! To the moon!"
"ChargePoint Leads Charge Across Europe with Strategic Acquisitions, Pioneering R&D Facilities and Growing Team...good article"
CHPT will close above 19-2 today
Losses hurt but at least take comfort knowing that when you buy a SPAC you helped make a few wealthy people wealthier.
"I am confident in this one.... yes pain at the moment but at this low price, with increased growth and increased earnings projection by management then I am happy to hold as things will improve and improve shortly as earnings is not so far away...(one month)"
Added some today. Sure at least bring 25% upside at this price.
If it breaks $22 by November I'm gonna be golden
I really hope you loaded today in the high 19s if you had the cash to do do. The time is quickly approaching where $20-$21 will become a wet dream.
Wow lots of FUD again today. Unfortunately/fortunately CHPT short term price action hinges on what happens with the infrastructure bill. Added 250 shares thanks. Long term CHPT will be a winner.
Hold on tight!! Will continue to run till infrastructure bill passed!!
"Driving a Sustainable FutureChargePoint is now one of the largest charging networks in North America and Europe with more than 150,000 charging ports accessible on its own network. ChargePoint works with the industry to enable drivers to roam across networks in North America and Europe with more than 200,000 roaming ports accessible to EV drivers. ChargePoint is also proud to highlight three billion electric miles have been driven on the network and drivers have avoided more than 120 million gallons of gas, avoiding over 450,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."
Funny this is the only green in my portfolio.
"Everyone who sells today will cry tomorrow. It is not a matter of “if” the infrastructure bill will pass, it’s a matter of when. Senate meeting today, deal is getting done this week. When CHPT is surging in the $35 range keep that same energy!"
of course we bought the dip
I had no choice but to buy substantially more in the low $18.90s.
"to those diamond hands who didnt give up and bought loads during the dip, congratulations this is just the beginning buckle up!!!"
"I should've known once i bought CHPT it would go down!! Sorry folks, I just cant pick a winner!!"
finally rolling in the money have 12 shares up 12 cents you do the math.
MMs want it below $20 for opex.
"Tho it would be nice, CHPT doesn't need the Gov't stimulus."
It still under control of the hedge funds and brokers Not going anywhere
CHPT will be bought out 35 share by end of year.
This stock does nothing but drops every single day.
heeh waiting for 16
All you Fair Value peanuts. Have you ever bought a house? A car? A mattress? A couch? A diamond? A share of Amazon in beginning? McDonald's? A bag of cocaine? Nothing is sold at fair value only preceved value.
is $19 now considered winning? cool. TO THE MOON!!!
Today we will see a new number which is 16s
Joe Manchin and Sinema are problems for green energy and really against climate change it seems .https://www.channel4.com/news/revealed-exxonmobils-lobbying-war-on-climate-change-legislation
Just sell drive it so low that any offering doesn’t make them money Guys saying they need it to create cash lol  Yeh right !!!Ceo insiders be the ones profiting Not investors They announce offering sell everything you got
is this going back to $13??
30k bought at the close
"Green Energy is way up today guys! Soon this sector will be back in favor. There's nothing wrong with CHPT , so dont listen to the daily know it all haters. Today is a nice trend reversal. If there was something wrong with CHPT it would be down today while the rest of the market is up. Can you imagine once the infrastructure bill passes and on market up days how well this will do?Yes, they're not profitable right now, which is fine, their official IPO after the SPAC was March 1st 2021. Right now they need to reinvest as much as possible into growing the business. The future will be great for CHPT. Good Luck to all longs."
So much insider selling going on. Any reason why?
At what price is this rumored secondary being offered?
premarket flux seems to be promising for a 5%+ day.
Why is this up???? It’s been sleeping for months now.
One of the most undervalued stock in whole market. RKT CHPT
"CANTLOSE where are you? HEEEEELLLOOOOOOOO out thereeeeeee!!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLO just crickets. I love it! You talk about how you are the best when the stock goes down, and say nothing on the uptrend! If you have such conviction, then you should be spreading FUD even more during the uptrend! But you dont! WWEEOOOOO"
Bought 2k @19.90 should I be worried?
"5.7M share dilution at $18.39. One would just think that to be a tiny hiccup as it represents a 1.5% dilution at a 7.7% discount. Of course, the market always overreacts."
"Stop buying at these prices, let the stock go down 17s"
"Lots of negative posts out here!! Always are when the entire market sells off!! So like some say we might go to 15 or even 10, just keep buying!! STRONG GROWTH FOR 10 YRS!! 100+"

I cannot find anything about this offering.
Quite the 5 day slide. Wow.
NIO & CHPT best safe EV plays 
Shorts are running for the hills tomorrow
Valuation and competition are the factors affecting this stock.
This stock really wants to break through $20. I also want that.
"All ""Green Energy"" was down today including solar, wind, RNG, EV, and the overall market too, except for Oil and Natural Gas. When your company is going down but its sector up is when you panic, but ""Green Energy"" spiked right after the kid sniffer got elected and a few months later started a strong decline. This is the time you diversify and accumulate across several ""Green Energy"" companies not just CHPT. Soon the market will start buying into ""Green Energy"" again, so there's no need to panic."
Filed 5.7M shares secondary offering.
I told people here many time that 17 was inevitable.
16 dollar wait just for 22 october friday  just wait baby
Man! This was like finding a mint condition Stan Musial baseball card in the 10¢ bin.
This stock is a puzzle to me
sling shot to $22.3
Gotta get 27 to break even this was a high flyer ($35-40) last Feb..
Common CHPT your the only stock I own that has weights tied to it's legs. Let's go!
To the moon 
"h u m m m m m m...... Just a puzzling question: if the shareholders expect this stock to go up to 25 to 30 or more, why would the official who sold Millions of shares sell at the top price of $20.57 instead of waiting a week or two?"
"Seems like it's going down again, CHPT never ceases to amaze me"
"The most fascinating thing about chpt, as a growth stock, is that it only declines. Definitely unique, I can see why longs love it."
Chargepoint getting charged up. Buy buy buy
Why is this so beaten down? The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill provides for $7.5 billion in charging network investments over a five-year period
Oh I loaded up with a ton of shares today anything under $20 is a gift!!Looking for a double by years end
"even with Hidens inflation, independent energy needs continue even morecso."
This is going to fall sharply on Monday ( 16s )

"Is ""Build Back Better"" political speak for inflation, unemployment and falling markets?"
"I address more 200 today and now sitting with 1500. One of the largest position. I believe the future is green, and if business has survived last 10 year , can do phenomenal in next 10 year. Market is going to be big and any business with life necessities like gas and groceries has no reasons but to flourish, at least IMHO."
another day in the life with a democratic government
"should be at least $700 a share like Tesla, they are both EV. To the MOOOOON!!!"
just wait for 22october storm is coming 
"ChargePoint will benefit greatly from the Infrastructure bill, I got back in today with 140 shares at around $19.8X usd per share.EV is the future!"
Here is Ali in Indy 500!!!
"Would’ve added more, but scared to use margin lol"
why try to time the bottom on a stock that has been in a pattern of lower highs and lower lows for 10 months?
"Nice description by Ziptrader on YouTube this evening. He gave a great explanation of the business model.1. Sell the charging unit.2. Sell the software.3. Maintenance of the software and the hardware of the charging units.Once a business buys a charging station, the profit making continues for ChargePoint! It’s like selling and maintaining shovels for a gold mine. Low risk, great return!"
I’m in starting with 5K shares PT $36 … I like it
"Once again, it's not about having 150,000 or 1 million charging stations out there. It's about how much it costs you to make them vs what you can sell them for (profit). If your margins are too low, then so will be your profits. That's why the stock price has been going down for months! The profits, revenue and earnings don't add up to a $6 BILLION MKT CAP!IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO HAS THE MOST CHARGING STATIONS. End of story."
So this is the full aftermath of the infrastructure bill not passing Friday. Burned to the ground. Time to rise from the ashes.
"Bag holders cheerleader chants: Don't panic - hang in there, great buying opportunity, it's because of the lockup, buy the dip/s, backup the truck, after the lockup - to the moon, Wallstreet is dropping the price to let their clients in - them it'll go back up, the smart money has been buying in big time, this is a long term hold, if you sell now you'll regret it 5-10 yrs from now, I'm buying all the dips, this is a gift, never thought I'd be able to buy this cheap, I'll be able to retire on this, sold all my other stocks and put it all into CHPT, it won't go below $20, $19/$18/$17/$16, this is the new bottom, etc etc.FLASH: Earnings, Revenue, Profits and Debt Do Matter!And inflation, $3 - $5 trillion in social engineering will kill this economy and stock market!! Be mindful of what this administration is doing to the country and remember that voting has consequences."
"good work lads, my breakeven is $20.30"
I think I said a short squeeze on Monday sorry maybe tomorrow or Friday to give shorts a surprise. Middle East has thumbed their noses at Hiden. Gas will be 5-6 dollars a gallon under the Hiden Harry Pelosi administration. Oil will cost more then diamond soon.
"Every time CHPT dipped below $20 this year, it rallies the following week.Check the charts!"
This will be an 80$ stonk by eoy
"All longs do not fear. This is a great time to add to your position. So, is this stock a fantastic short term investment, no. If you want quick returns put it in oil and gas which is up almost every day. However, we are a fantastic long term play. CantLose will try to convince you that there's nothing spectacular about EV chargers. Well guess what Mcdonalds makes plenty of money selling burgers and Coke makes plenty of money selling syrup water. Not every product needs to be rocket science to make great revenues. CantLose will ignorantly tell you that ""just like gas pumps nobody cares about chargers"". Well I guess he hasn't heard of ""Dover Corporation (DOV)"" which does build gas pumps and has revenues of 7.34 Billion a year and a 155 dollar stock. Just treat this like a long term savings account and keep accumulating. Not all of us are rich guys who have millions to invest. Some of us , like me, are middle class computer programmers who have to wait every 2 weeks to get our paychecks to invest. So I welcome these lows, to give me time to invest. And in a few years, we will all be talking about when CHPT was only 19 dollars a share."
ready for 16 dollar range guys be ready dont buy today just waitbuying range 16 or 15 be patient
"Not much to say but will keep moving up before passage of infrastructure Bills, both of them! Covid daily infection rate falling like a rock! Vaccination rate way up! Stock market in for a HUGE RALLY! Last time when sleepy Joe stimulated the economy stock market DOUBLED! People conveniently forget that!!"
The bill will pass 100%. Crazy oil prices will make the bills pass
"If you’re long and want to sleep well, download the ChargePoint App. I think you’ll be amazed by how many (1000s) of charge stations there are in the US and Europe. If you are short and want to sleep well, don’t look at the facts."

All you need to do with this stock is to wait patiently until the infrastructure bill is approved.

Prediction - GM will buy CHPT for 30+
Let's see by 2030 30 percent of cars are predicted to be electric!! Where do you think chpt share price will be with 1 million + location
i think this is the most depressing stock i have ever held.... still long... but FFS... about time it rose to some semblance of its true value... my belief is $30
"Blink has 90 employees, and Chargepoint has over 1,000 That should tell you something."
"What is amazing is Blink is consistently running several $$ higher than CHPT with having hardly any market share and a fraction of the revenue. I can't wait until CHPT finally gets its due rewards for leading the market with 70+ market share. I'm convinced, in 5 years, this stock will easily be a $500 to $1000 stock."
"Nice week if you're long and could add... Looks like it's consolidated/found support here, and it always seems to bounce/reverse when it does, especially after an oversell like this. We should also see a run up to the I-Bill passage (Hint: it's gonna happen, either way)."
"today's Motley Fool article is everything I have been saying since I started shorting chpt in the mid 30's, non-differentiated commodity & low margin. Nothing that warrants the valuation."
Im calling the low to be today. I added but have a stop at 17.30. (cuz im wrong alot unlike our friend cant lose)This may well be forming a large descending wedge.
insiders do need to show some confidents even though they do own many thousands of shares each already
GM buy offer will catapult CHPT to 30+
"$25 squeeze tomorrow, 1000 shares added, infrastructure bill getting passed today/tonight. EV charging going to fly."
Simple reason why this stock is down is the interest rate risk. A 0.5% hike will kill it’s balance sheet. Dead money at the moment with the uncertainty.
"Hmmm... There's now about 2% EVs out there today, with an implied 98% market up for grabs (i.e., the ground floor here). And, from a charging angle, just who is best situated to benefit the most from that potential? ...Ya, 'nuff said (and all analysts agree)."
im waiting for 15 range
$CHPT should correct higher!
"im here to announce CHPT is the ""today's PLUG"" for tmr! c yall tmr"
Last chance to get in under $20!!
"Lucky market has been on fire for the last two days, otherwise this would have been sinking fast."
This should hold around $18 until the insider trading is done due to the unlock period. #1 shareholder has been selling per filings. It was done in advance. Should be able to get back in around November before earnings and never look back. Best of luck all
25 after the infrastructure bill passes
back to 20's... thanks for the cheap shares
"Cantlose, where are you? "
This is a good swing and longterm play. Just put a stop loss at around 19.45/19.50 and you are completely fine.
$20 tomorrow
I love this stock!!!!!
They make alot of charging stations but what they dont make is money
This stock could be over $ 25 so fast that it would make your head spin.We have a Bright Future !
TO the moon
What is happening??
"Thumbs up if you think will close above $20 today, Thumbs down if below. i will go first. lets see who is right."
"In a nutshell, this is part of the problem for Chargepoint: ZEV. Companies like this and Tesla are building their own charging stations. ZEV is manufacturing them to work with any Ev vehicle, not just their own. They’ve also got some really large orders, the largest recently came from Berkshire. I’m not suggesting you dump Chargepoint, only you might want to throw some money at ZEV because that’s where the action is headed."
"Im out.bought this for a trade. boy was i dead wrong. and this is dead money. for a loooooong time.buying more dvn. ill make up the losses and then some,gl to the longs. youre going to need it."
"Hard to find a stock that didn't make a nice move up over the last 2 days, but here is an exception. so SPACtacular."
Why so many inside selling ? Anyone knows ..
"For those that like facts instead of fads and rumors, read the Motley Fool article ""Why EV Charging Stocks Could Fall Further"". It describes the reasons why the the three top charging company stocks have been struggling and going down. Oh, I'm not a short. I too made the mistake of buying CHPT thinking it could be profitable. After doing more research, I realized it was a mistake. These charging station companies are really commodity companies and there really isn't any big differences between them. And certainly no wide moats to entry for another company to jump in. Just having more charging stations than the other guy doesn't justify an obsurd mkt cap. It will always come down to the financials, always. Revenue, profits and earnings will always win in the long term. And just hanging in there and a gif of a rocket ship taking off doesn't change the numbers! But hey, if emotions is how you buy stocks instead of real facts, then back the truck up. Also, ask yourself why the insiders have been dumping their shares. I know I'm not the only one that realizes that at some point we'll have to sell, take the loss and move on. Even Buffett lost money on his airline stock bets. The hard part is always facing the fact that you made a mistake, selling and moving on."
