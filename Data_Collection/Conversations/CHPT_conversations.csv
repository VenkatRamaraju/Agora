Just getting beat down Not today Looks like it’s going to fly This month call options Being bought Getting to be really expensive to buy a 23 dollar call lol 
What prevents me from doubling my stake in CHPT is that the majority of their chargers are L2 which is NOT the future. Has there been any discussion or any noise about transitioning to DCFC (L3) by CHPT? Or at least any strategy on evolving from the limitations of L2 charging?
"Buy buy buy and more buy, shorts covering all week  "
"Add another $3 gain after hours, I have a strong feeling "
last earnings report (3 months ago) stock went from low 20's to $36...today's earnings and guidance were better...I'm just saying
Keeps dropping! Any thoughts on a bottom?
huge battle at 23. If it breaks 23 shorts are in trouble.
Going out of business sale?
"Well, its a waiting game. Congrats to those who bought it cheap today. Guess things will get better nearer to earnings' date."
"Big money has been pouring into CHPT, more than 50 new hedge funds in 1 week, looks like there bullish on earnings, bullish on the simple fact that the Infrastructure bill is an upcoming huge catalyst for ev charging, and bullish that this company is particular owns 75% of the market share on EV charging.$35 end of September"
"I haven't looked yet in detail, but the lower profit might be partially from the cost of the acquisitions they made."

looks like market doesn't like Newsom
"To put things in perspective, there are about $1,560 gas stations per capita in the US with about 60 EV charge stations per Capita in 4 states. Saw the Mach E on the road yesterday and it's a beau..."
All electric cars in NY State by 2035.
Millions of vehicles are coming to market in the next several years. If you thought CHPT was a short term play you were mistaken.
"hi CHPT shorts, what do you prefer, a cremation or a burial ?"
I don't know how anyone can claim that this is not manipulated when we are trading almost 35 million shares and we are in such a narrow range. Very uncharacteristic for this stock.
selling puts
After reading Bidens infrastructure plan article I don't think these charging companies have enough money. They stated 100k to build one fast charging station. Does it cost chargepoint that much?
Going back to $10
"BEEM and CHPT are going all the way! Every gas station will be installing EV Charging pumps. They have to! By 2025 EV s will skyrocket in sales! Chevron, Exxon, Shell and independents will be installing EV CHARGING STATIONS/PUMPS. Washington keeps horsing around with the infrastructure bill! But it will eventually get done then oh baby….. LTFF …!!!!!!!"
It will go up on a strong bull trend just be patient very soon
Just purchased Porsche Taycan and the dealer highly recommended charge point at home station.
Ready for a huge run up next week?
Actually compared to many spacs CHPT price still much better. As many spacs went below $10. This company long term definitely a winner. Matter of time. Sure shorts have some time to play.
High short interest + bright future + infrastructure bill push = 100  chpt that's where u get my shares shorty ..lol watch the pain now..
wow

Down $9000 on this… what should I doooo 
I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/htyuzu ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them.
Is my patience finally going to pay off?
The shorts will cover quickly tomorrow!Every Auto Maker is talking about the Electric Vehicles coming shortly.Charge Point has been preparing for this Reality for quite some time now !Reap the Rewards !
$30 by next Friday
Reddits are now talking to take this ER and this opportunity to take this over 100
Sit back and wait for the day trader's and quick profit taking sellers to subside. The stock will go up then down with a steady upward track over time. Just sit back and relax. It's not going to $40 next week or the following. I'm guessing we have a good one with chpt.
no doubt a long term winnershort term may be rocky as they as going to lose money for quite awhile and if the market ever sells off then generally the money losing stocks fair the worst.long term should be fine though
"I expect more upgrades will be coming our way.""Wall Street is optimistic about the long term. Eight out of 10 analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for small capitalization stocks is about 60%. The average analyst target price is about $35 a share, implying gains of about 65% from recent levels."""
"in a tough market feels good to know I can always generate income by shorting CHPT, SPAC joke."
I have options CALL ME $23 YES!!!!
That a gal. 16K shares strong here. Glta.
It will be back to $35 in no time.
We need some news!!!!
TipRanks has strong buy to $35.75. Holding long and green!
We will be seeing north of 23$ today
"Bought 1000 shares @$20.52. ,"
It’s going to break out to the upside !The Way Upside !
Boooooom!!!!
"The whole market is red, it will turn back to the upside very very soon, just have to be patient, it's called a headfake sell to try and get people to sell, and then those a, holes buy it back after you sell for no reason at all."
only insiders preparing to delute shares that all.
how is volume climbing by the millions without a budge in price? can someone explain
"More promising EV news coming from Norway. In August 72% of new cars sold were 100% EV, hybrid EV's 20% and only 8% fossile. Another proof that with government incentives the EV transition is picking up incredible speed. Some people obviousily do not want the stock price to go up but they are a fighting a losing battle."
Expect a big run up today
manipulation will destroy the integrity of the stock market.
I do not think we will be seeing this stock in the low $20s again....
"Just waiting on congress to pass the infrastructure bill, and everyone knows the right and left both want it passed, then it's off to the races ^"
Yep under $21 again so I bought more again.
This is already trading at 3x 2026 expected sales.....
As expected CHPT always bounces when it hits the $20's. It's never failed me yet. Great point to DCA and if it dips further I'll just keep buying.
Buying more if we go to $20………
"question of the day, will the shorts get squeezed today?"
I am a big believer in this company and will keep loading because I am sure it will be over $30 by the end of the year.
All about the sales lets gooooo
Consolidating around 23. That’s a good sign. I’m expecting a growth next week :)
Number 1 trending stock with 10% short float;
"Are all charging stations the same, generic, for what ever vehicle you have telsa, lucid, nio, etc"
Doing great!! Still has way to go before hits $18.00
"ChargePoint's future lies with the success of Nissan, Ford, GM, etc. EV vehicles. The problem is that those companies' EVs aren't doing great compared to Tesla."
Holding strong at $23 
Halt?
how has CHPT not exploded?! i watched the volume increase by 800% since this morning with only an 8% gain in price which was very very consistent through out the day
"Yeah baby, I love the dips. Just added 20k. If you are not invested into the future... Well let's just say Goodluck with that!"
got a long way to go to break even on this girl
"I’m thinking of getting into EV stocks, don’t own any. If I were to invest 1000 dollars? What stocks someone would recommend? BLINK, CHARGEPOINT, or XPENG?"
"Looks like the big boys got the discount they were looking for, time to run."
"Chip delivery is actually improving across the board except your not hearing anything about it from your usual news sources, why? Earnings are great, so are sales"
I'm curious how electric everything will work during hurricane season? Anybody?
"Shorted this pre at 24.5, cashed out 8% in an hr. Easy money."
I finally came back and bought 500 shares of chpt. Well it’s time to buy because 22 is the floor and if it drops blow 20 then I buy the dip. I’m on 60k cash waiting to buy more and more till we hit 
Good buy at the bottom 20$ to 21$....
CHPT long until 2030. Expect 1000% profit from here 
Solid report and outlook. They can short or sell out all they want. I’m holding to next year and confident stock will move substantially higher.
"I think there will be several winners in the charging market. I went with this. Unless it runs fast, I will buy more."
"where did all the ""To the MOON"" peeps go? crickets....."
Thanks for the chance to buy more
We have only just begun

This will go up like upstart! Just hold and diamond hand!!!!!!
Do they report after the bell tomorrow?
Thanks for the discounts.
23today?
be cautious tomorrow. there could be a little slide in the stock as day Traders take their profits in the afternoon. but it should pick up Monday hopefully
"since the low 30's I have been telling you guys, this is a $3-5/shr stock, we are running out of gullible buyers and - as always - fundamentals will prevail over hype."
One big contract and we’re at $50……
At PM shorts are trying to scare people out. But we know this stock is a good to buy and it’ll hit 50$ soon.
Previously bought 200 shares with the intent to hold for minimum 5 years. The games will iron-out after the majority of cars are electric.
"This isn't even the worst of it for companies like CHPT that have no profits. Wait till the 10 -15% mkt correction takes place! The recent drops to $20 - $21 will look great to where it will go. High growth stocks with little to no profits, earnings and revenue will get clobbered. That's reality. With inflation on the rise and this administration's $3-5 trillion social engineering proposals, watch them tank the economy and stock markets!!"

Okay time to start DCA... 250 shares for every dollar it drops...
Bought some CHPT 22.41
"The hell with the shorts, this stock will be $40+ and not too far in the future."
7.5 billion coming soon for an EV charging network.
"Market Correction only concern here, just buy more or ride it out, going to have 20% move in one day coming, don't miss it."
Congratulations all!
"what is today's theme? are we going with the standard ""buy the dip"" or pretending chpt is ""shaking out weak hands""?"
Minimum risk.Hasn’t been under $20 in a year.Usually when stock is lower before earnings is because the big boys are driving the price down.I think we might see a decent beat and maybe $23 after hours.
NY to build largest Charging network in world by 2030. Who will it be? I can tell you this it will be 2 or multiple charging companies. No one company will be able to keep up with the needed pace.
"honestly, if this isnt the worst performing stock in your portfolio you should stop investing"
NICE VOLUME!
bull traps all September long.. $19.6 is target
Was the increased revenue guidance because of acquisitions or was it all organic?
Will bounce up so seriously
Will it get 41m in volume?Lol and stay at 23
WE ALL KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN!!!
I’m expecting some good earnings!
"TheStreet article says it all. SPACS have lost over $75B in value the last 6 months!!! CHPT was listed as one of the stocks. SPACS have been great for the insiders and management, not so good for the average retail investors. VOLTA (VLTA) is another SPAC that's going to be unkind to retail investors. CHPT will be going back to the $20-21 area very soon."
"can't wait for the, Why CHPT went down today article."
so far so good stock is holding steady may be at what they call support or resistance. If stays here at end of day buying more tomorrow
They say timing is everything so yesterday I bought the dip for lotsa shares. Yay me
Nobody ever said it would be easy ?Patience !
I guess the numbers are good?
"Everyone should read the Simply Wallstreet article on ChargePoint Holding on Yahoo news. It's an eye opener on the problems facing CHPT! Especially they cash flow and cash burn. I left realizing that most likely they will do another stock offering, which will dilute the share price fb or existing shareholders. Their European acquisitions and cash burn is a problem and is getting worse. And to the fact that it will be years before they will be cash flow positive, puts this company at high risk. Do your own due diligence and ask the hard questions. Don't invest on emotional feelings or because its related to ""EV""."
It’s breaking out man……..
This was $35 at the end of June and will be back to $35 by the end of Sept…and then all the shorts bears on here will thankfully fall silent.
CHPT goes down $1.19 on no news?? This the largest EV charging co. in the US so what is it that investors don't understand?
Get in before blowout earnings
Long and strong!!!! Let’s gooooooo
“Wussap YouTube”
Stock will be back above 30 by months end
This has potential to be a meme play...10% short float.
27 by the end of the day Mark my word 
Price should go up as we get close to infrastructure bill date. I could be wrong but I don't see any downside pressure for now. Today was important milestone.
It is about to fly to the moon
"It's goin"" to 100"
35 dollar stock in the making.
"You can bet PTs will move higher, maybe tomorrow."
"Never seen so many longs excited to own a stock that, after a 'massive rally"" is still down ~10% in 3 weeks. zzzzzzzz"
"My $Chpt entry yesterdayDate Type Description Categories Amount $08/31/21 Bought 4000 of CHPT @ $21.3853 (Order #20763) Unassigned - 85,541.21"
This ended up being a terrible investment.
"Congrats all CHPT holders nice boost up afterhours as it should be, waiting on conference call now for a bright outlook in the world of EV charging. $CHPT $FSR goes higher today, YES!!!"
"Hey shorters, go buy some lubricant!It hurts a lot tonight!"
ChargePoint is the current market leader by revenue in the electric vehicle charging station industry yet keeps going down do investors do their research or just shorts keeping it down
Lots of positive media coverage coming.
Motley Fool posts contradicting articles about this stock daily
"The market pulled back today, after a strong opening. Most stock's were down today, not because CHPT is a bad company. CHPT actually started the trading day strong, gaining more than 2%, but because the market pulled back. The pressure was too much for investors, If the market breaks this losing streak, CHPT will sore."

Great price to get in. Easy $50 plus
"shorts get a free poster ""HOUSE FOR SALE"" from the bank"
Yippee  Soaring tomorrow!

"CHPT shorts are like coffee beans, grown green and quickly roasted"
Brokers lending just the right amount to keep where they want Tomorrow will drop to where everThey want 18 19 This much volume and it didn’t move all day
So the floor is 21$ shorty. Well if u drop below 20$ I’m waiting to add 1k bring it on or stop playing.

They had some interesting insights about CHPT on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
been holding awhile at 26.15 cost. might sell soon
woohoo
$19 tomorrow. shorts have you hostage for a few more weeks
And it’s all legal 42m shares traded 12 hours ago And it was 23 5m shares traded in first hour And it’s down to 21 Just criminal....
"DO NOT SELL, shareholders going to rush in when market opens, chpts earnings makes BLINK and EVGO look like Boy Scouts. Everyone who’s reading this knows who the #1 EV charging company is to this date. Previous price target $35, now with revenue guidance up 15% EOY, new price targets are going to come in at$40.Yes you read that correctly, this is a $40 stock. Like it or not"
"another day, another bull trap... continue to $19.00"
Sept is always sell off after the labor’s day .. market will pick up 3 weeks of sept .. that is historical trend . Buy on red days to accumulate your position
lock up period the shares were ate up last week.
Bullish flag forming on a 6 month look...strong bounce from $20.
zack predicted disappointed earning from $CHPTI am crossing my fingers hoping $CHPT reporting sale grow...
STILL GOOD PRICE TO BUY .... BUY BUY BUY $23-25
"Taking the gap up from earnings into consideration, it’s common to have a minor pullback for a day or two before the real move upward. Buy the dip. But if you want to be safe, sure, wait until the buying begins."
I have the ChargePoint app on my phone. Happy to be a shareholder. 
Stock will bounce up strong bull trend for next week
this goes to 19 tomorrow be carefull
Shorts will try hard to keep this down. Unfortunately I strongly believe it’s going to the moon.
chpt has a one year Target price of $35.60. it just might make it.
"Stock will be back to $26 very soon, it’s undervalued, ignore the haters on the board. If they are shorting this at $20-21 they had lost their mind. There are so many other stocks which are far better shorters than this. AFRM for example last fridays jump to 126 was a little too overreacted. It was a clear sign for a 10-15 bucks drop. But no, they are shorting CHPT for a buck or two drop and spam here all weekend."
short it at 20.80
 $ very soon
Crushes earnings and back to the year low we go...smh
everybody be afraid of the Delta. help me get my buy price 18.00
"Governments around the world disdain TSLA but they need charge stations to combat climate change. Funding will go to charge point,"
Yes!!! & I bought another call @ the end
market is fragile.. correction will drop growth stocks additional 20%. wait for better price.
"Hey Shorty, When you come at the king you best not miss."
"Stock will not see $25/share again for multiple years, if new competition emerges it will never again reach it. Chargers are extremely simple devices, the only reason competition is sparse is because nobody is turning a profit. chpt has zero patents for a reason, a charger's components are all readily available & commoditized. this stock is a joke. nobody will care in 2-3 years just like you dont care who makes gas pumps."
5.4 million traded AH as of 6:12 PM.
+28-30% at close tomorrow
8% up after market.
50$ coming soon
This should pop
This rally will take this beyond 40. Hold tight. This stock is for the future. 2025 it will be minimum 150$ stock
Gee I thought earnings would be a catalyst up not down. Anyone thing charging market will be saturated with competitors? I'm down 20k on this sure thing.
"Blind longs here have no clue what has happened to the float to date or once fully unlocked. SPAC joke. stock has dropped 40% and mkt cap is around same, doesnt take a genius, wake up."
"I did not find anything, any news?"
"When Nasdaq has the next 5% correction which will happening for sure at some point from now to the next 4 to 6 months or so, you will be able to buy this stock for at least $18.00 if not lower."
we're in big trouble if this drops below $19.50.
BUT BUY BUY !!!! If it can break this at 40m volThan will jump to 26 28
Why so much hate and fuss on this board? When it goes up all next week all yall will disappear
revenue growth. not loss. this is a growth stock. takes money to make money no?
"Recent fleet software oriented acquisitions make plain Chargepoint positioning for major fleet sales. Think Amazon, USPS and others"
New price target 40
i got 50 sept 10 21.50 calls. i need some help please.
Most EVers hit today. Looks like risk off trading compounded by upcoming freeing of millions of shares for CHPT.
BUY NOW BEFORE INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL IS FINALIZED THIS MONTH.
House just passed the budget resolution. Rocket time coming for all EV!!
"I really want to get CHPT because of their position in early stages of EV market, but the valuation for a company that is still years from profitability scares me. The owners of spac and chargepoint agreed that $10/share was fair price based on huge growth potential. Someone please convince me what has changed to make CHPT worth $20/share. Granted, after being almost $50, $20 seems like a bargain."
Mazda offering Chargepoint credits with new 2022 EV models
What happened to $3 up
The US gives 120 billion to oil companies in subsidies Gee if they stop giving them that and invest more than 7 billion Things might seem like they will change but as long as we are giving the oil industry 120 billion a year to keep polluting and keep the same status quo Than this will never go above 30
"the sept 21 PUTS are up 117% today, but longs dont care, they wont wait 5 years and see if chpt can finally make a single $ of profit."
One of the easiest stocks to make money on. So many paper hands. Cheers!!!
Nasdaq falling but chpt is showing strength!
$27 today
"The Dutch EV market is several years ahead of the US. Dutch EV charging point manufacturer Alfen had a stock price of EUR 12,31 (YE18), 16,44 (YE19), 82,60 (YE20) and todays stock price is 100,60. That is +800% in less than 3 yrs. I bet once EV transition gets momentum in the US history will repeat itself also for CHPT. It's all about patience and not getting frustrated seeing many other shares going up almost every day. The good times are yet to come!"
Not up 15% like AH yesterday. But if you consider how bad the past few weeks have been this is a pleasant reprieve from that.
looking good right now.
Glad i sold at 33 awhile ago.
shorts are in big trouble. buying $150k more.
Shares Lockup Period Ended last week and selling will continue for time being. I am very bullish on the CHPT in the long run and it will be an excellent opportunity to buy the dips before the infrastructure bill is approved by the Senate.
This is a 5 year stock . Come back in 5 years .
"ChargePoint introduced the most comprehensive global EV charging solution portfolio available for fleets of all types and sizes. Fleet management software, combined with ChargePoint’s AC and DC fast charging solutions, balance charging costs with operational readiness for light- to heavy-duty vehicles across depot, on-route and at-home charging. In June, ChargePoint partnered with Mercedes to launch the new benchmark in EV charging in North America — Mercedes me Charge — to be rolled out with the all-new EQS all-electric luxury sedan and available in all EQ future mobility products from Mercedes-EQ. Also, in July, the company signed an agreement to acquire has•to•be — an e-mobility provider with a leading European charging software platform. The above series of events is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter."
"This is like buying smartphone stock before everyone had one, Do we all use gas? guess what's on the horizon !GLTA"
Run shorty run.
"nothing said here matters, either revenue is up 125+% on 9/1 or it drops like a rock. last qtr was 23%, blink went 1st and got wiped w/ 100% top line growth. the hype has run its course, all meaningful movement from here is coming from results and guidance."
In what year will chargers really be needed/ in demand?Obviously it is t now.
"sorry to state the obvious, but investing prowess seems light here, good stocks dont lose half their value in ~8 months. hope this helps."
maybe pick some up at 15
Nice showing on a red day I’ll take it
Josh Brown sold his position you don't think he said he'd sell at 20 and do it no he tricked you all said he'd sell if falls below 20 but he tricked you you. BUT should go up on Monday now that he's out of the way.
Just mute the nay sayers !Enjoy !
Best company strong support at $20 will be over $100 in the long run with the EV expansion. Strong Buy 
Let’s go back to 35$ this Friday

"ChargePoint to Announce Second Quarter Financial Results on Wednesday - September 1, 2021 at 4:30 pm EST. Link to the conference call: https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3192631/71BB9CAC03265694BBC9EBA65DB6C7ED"
Stuck my toe in today.
Charge Point is best in breed and they just raised their guidance !
what are the chances for good earning!
Does this earnings even matter? Its the infrastructure bill we care about right? About 7.5 billion is in there for EV charging networks.
Is there any chance TESLA or a major automaker would want to buy CHPT in the next 12-24 months?
the last shorts are now falling from the trees
"Losing steam fast, I guess no one is brave enough to bet on this gem before earnings!"
I see it over 50 this time. The momentum is getting back and the charts r so strong !! Let's play !
Price target raised to 40 It drops .... lol  They all do it as soon as it’s announced big brokers borrowers Buy puts for months out Making share price drop Cause all the shares are lent out While at the same time they are buying at low prices So that when they stop Buying options contracts puts Than switch to buying calls In the same process Now they have at dirt cheap Real shares So now start buying calls Getting shares lent again driving It up It’s criminal That’s all that happening here Look at the volume it doubles Every now and than Just shares being lent out
"Blow out earnings tomorrow. I work for the city of California and they’re installing over 50,000 charging stations"
What is wrong with charge point
stop putting stop orders in you will be taken out. sell if you want to sell but stop selling with stop orders. Without stop orders this should go up.
Why we trending today?
Who is brave enough to at the least buy another 1k shares today at this discounted price!!!
Why is this stock not over $30 by now? Seems to me it was way oversold for the months prior to the last ER.
Just checked technicals again. Downtrend continuation and will test support levels.
Nearly a million shares traded in pre-market and up over 15%.
"Is this a valuation issue or the market has reached its peak? Fundamentals does not count anymore, this just keeps going down and There’s no sight of it turning around."
Strong bull week ahead as I foresaw.
Yesterday 500. Today 150 shares more from dip.
I have $CHPT & BLNK and I see BLNK chargers @ each movie studio lot I’ve been on in CA (which is a lot of chargers) Which will need to be significantly increased cause Cali’s love our EVs. Where are all the $CHPT chargers?
