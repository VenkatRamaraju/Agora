"Duterte pivoted the Philippines into a pacific military alliance with China and Russia. Next will be nationalization of corporations and seizure of foreign assets, starting with U.S. and Japanese interests in the country. I would not want to be a holder of investments dependent on any involvement of the Philippine government. Both China and Russia are salivating in urgent desire to control the natural resources in Philippines. If you own mining stocks, check to ensure they don't have assets in this country. This will turn out to be exactly the same as Venezuela, a case where investments went to zero."

"I don't see the ""steady growth"" that so many keep referring to with PHI. Even looking back 5 years the growth has been undulating at best and for the past year it has been trending downward not ""growing"". Another fact for US based investors is that the foreign tax rate on PHI dividends is 25%! And if you hold the ADR in an IRA you get no US tax credit to offset that very high tax rate. So the biggest selling point for PHI has been that it's a dividend ""monster"". That may be true, but in my Roth I'm getting screwed. Only 75% of dividends passing thru to me, the remainder withheld and nothing I can do about it. If PHI were actually a growth stock, then the reduced dividend rate would be fine. But with a significant reduction in stock price over the past year (I bought in 2020), I'm not seeing much upside now and I'm reconsidering my investment. I need to crunch some numbers but the stock loss is probably exceeding the reduced dividend yield, meaning I'm continuing to lose value in this investment. Thoughts?"
