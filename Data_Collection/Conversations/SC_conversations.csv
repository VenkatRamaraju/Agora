Santander Consumer USA is down 5.04% to 21.68
Hard to believe this POS keeps raising. Their whole subprime auto origination is about to collapse.....
They are a solid company and 2018 net earnings were practically double that of the previous year. EPS is up and the Fed is basically pumping up the banks right now as well. All these factors are optimistic. But those are only a few factors that affect stock price.
Will the final deal terms be announced late tonight? Special committee and SAN have had plenty of time to negotiate this deal.

"$40B in subprime autoloans, ouch. Think of the effect if only a small number of people default. Well at least they can repossess and sell their cars right? Ouch again, the use car market is going to be in the dumps. This stock is down big but you would have to be insane to bet on it right now."

"SC is basing now, but seems to be stalling. They've already produced record earnings, but it's just sitting there floating off of the the recent gap up. I'm wondering if this will hold or if there's some manipulation talking place. I'm expecting this company to do great things. But going to set my sells stops, just in case. Does anyone have any thoughts?"
