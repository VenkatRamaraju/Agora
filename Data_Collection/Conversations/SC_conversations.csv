"Shocked this isn't crashing since they are basically committing fraud with all the junk that is being securitized and stamped AAA by the rating agencies. When everyone is making money no one cares, just like the housing bubble."
$SC is the next $DOGE if you don’t know now you know. Look at their charts. Only difference is SC is not a meme coin.

"Stated income subprime lending the same reason for the 2007 mortgage crisis is now falling rapidly. The company has done a stock offering, running out of cash, as they are lending on car loans where borrowers cannot afford the high cost. $5,000 loan cost the consumer $10,000 how is this legal? Massachusets and Delaware state attorneys have won class-action lawsuits for high-cost loans to borrowers that could not pay the loans. https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3053099&headline=SC-Santander-Consumer-downgraded-to-Underweight-from-Equal-Weight-at-Barclays"

They are packaging complete garbage into asset backed bonds. When the first smoke appears it will turn into an inferno. Stretching out used car loans to 7-8 years to subprime borrowers. Recipe for disaster.

"SC is basing now, but seems to be stalling. They've already produced record earnings, but it's just sitting there floating off of the the recent gap up. I'm wondering if this will hold or if there's some manipulation talking place. I'm expecting this company to do great things. But going to set my sells stops, just in case. Does anyone have any thoughts?"

Fiat-Chrysler likely consolidates financing under Renault Finance after the merger. Renault Finance has 42% penetration rate vs SC’s 31% rate. What would SAN pay for SC if 1/3 of the business goes away?

This is about to drop hard. They have reached into deep subprime. Once the first subprime asset backed bond goes bust their origination will come to a screeching halt. Bankrupt anyone?

They are a solid company and 2018 net earnings were practically double that of the previous year. EPS is up and the Fed is basically pumping up the banks right now as well. All these factors are optimistic. But those are only a few factors that affect stock price.
