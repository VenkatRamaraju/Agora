"I would be anxious in hearing people's opinions of the two companies, Driver Management and Clover Partners who are trying to increase the value of FUNC. Driver, who owns 5% of FUNC is doing it by nominating three directors for the Spring 2020 Annual Meeting. Clover, who owns 22,500 shares has written a letter to FUNC Management, but is short on details on how they plan to increase the share price. Will these two companies be able to significantly move the share price. If so how."

"Driver contacted me looking for support to force FUNC management into looking more closely at strategic alternatives. They know that between us and our subscribers we own a lot of shares. We would like to see a takeover happen as I have written before and it would not surprise me if it is getting closer. Benj Gallander, Contra the Heard Investment Letter www.contratheheard.com"

This dividend is great. Companies that start dividends tend to do better than the stock market for the three years following the implementation of the dividend. This should boost this stock and $0.36 annually is sweet on top of it. Excellent!Benj Gallander
