Bummed that I missed adding to my position when this was in the 7s.
how will Xiaomi news affect Viomi?
https://fintel.io/so/us/viot?utm_source=stocktwits.com
This one should be $40 in 6 months.
pick up at 4.20
Increase in Revenues this quarter is very promising. It is not only related to COVID-19 - can say that by looking at Q1 2019 676M RMB - revenues are now doubled compared to that.
"Soon other undervalued Chinese companies will follow $VIOT! Others where i'm bullish on are $MKD, $BEST and $KRKR! All of these have massive revenue streams and growth and will very soon multiply many times"
Viomi Technology is up 6.30% to 6.49
Can’t imagine what’s going to happen when financial results come out 
going to $6.50 in few days..news are about to come
"in the conference call, they are mentioning a lot about ecommerce and advertising revenue models through ; 21face refregirators , tv screens and washing machine. This might be the next unicorn in few days I guess,they already reached more then 4.5 million customers!!!"
"ok my post was pulled, instead of humor whats the outlook for the future of robotic maids being handled by the IOT sector. Were talking a potential trillion dollar market. The vacuums seem to be a step in that direction. How many years off are we from butler technology then to AI maid robots?"
I guss I'll be a shareholder for a very long time!
Today was a lovely day.
FYI: Q3 Earning on Nov 26th.
Nice reversal in the last 4 days. My cost average of VIOT is now $4.47 after aggressive buying when it hit new low. I believe management has start their buy back (which makes me more confident with management). Double digit sale grow. One of the very few China ADR that is already very profitable. I am holding my shares for the long haul my friend!!! GLTA VIOT Investors
"Whats the problem here? Im interested in this stock, bit something seems strange"
"This is going back to teens very soon, unbeatable entry point"
And now they hit $18.49 in the AH on Friday with no news?
VIOT is up 7.43% to 11.20
Price went up because of Guolao Investments owning more than 5%. https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1742770/000118518521000256/guolaoinv20210220_sc13g.htm
Viomi Technology is down 7.98% to 5.19
Expecting over 8 tomorrow!
"The lowest shares I brought today was $6.0926. Brought back 1/2 of my previous position (Sold them earlier when it went toward $8). With Chinese slowly going back to work, I believe when I looked back at these purchase 2 years from now, I will be happy that I did. GLTA VIOT Investors!"
"This company is China home technology systems, wireless controls through voice commands, futures home, soild revenue at first half year 2018, the Ipo at 9, now 8, to me, this is the opportunity."
Over 10$ does anyone see volume picking up as index funds and such start including this stock in their portfolio?
Let’s run that other 60% :)
"Brought back in for the earning of August 24 based on the rapid growth of 5G development. VIOT is the market leader on 5G appliance in China and at this price, VIOT is a bargain that haven't been discovered yet!https://www.cnet.com/news/5g-will-change-the-world-and-china-wants-to-lead-the-way/"
I am going long here.
"This stock should be trading at $40 right now. At 10.50 it is less than its annual sale. However, anything above 12 is a struggle because money managers and hedge funds in the US have no love for this stock.They and their auto trading algorithm decide the price.The best thing to do for this stock is to dual list it on Shenzen. Chinese retail traders will love this stock more than they love the Roborock stock which has 10x market cap but less revenue and profit. Then 10x is a guarantee. They need to move this ticker back closer to home to gain greatness."
today is a beautiful day sirs and madams :D
Viomi Technology reached a 52 Week high at 8.09
Target price should be at least 15$
"I don't understand anything, the results have been good"
Viomi Technology is up 19.27% to 18.94
What is up with this stock? Zero coverage and it is up over 30% in the past few weeks
Viomi Technology is up 6.96% to 5.38
"Your rightly angry, revenue guidance for Q3 (1.00B -1.10B) vs. analyst estimate (1.82B) is a bad joke!"
"Sold all my shares a couple weeks ago for a decent profit (due to worries about the virus situation). But brought back in some at $7.25 today, just too cheap for me not to bite again even if I have to hold on until it recovered. GLTA Viot Investors"
Viomi Technology reached a 52 Week high at 9.31
"Seems like there is no one following these guys...fast growth, profitable, very low valuation, micro-cap in a fast growing segment...what am I missing? Seems like this company could be a 10-bagger pretty easily. 35% insider ownership and Xiomi adds confidence...so what are the risks? Or has the market just not picked up on this one yet?"
"Not complaing, but does anyone know why is this going to the moon?"
Triple digit growth in revenue and double digit growth in net profit with plenty of liquidity and almost no debt.A sell off sounds right.
If you do your own DD you will find out this was undervalued considerably. Analysts are now saying this stock is worth close to 50. Next week this will continue to rise. GLA
Unique great business model! One of the best 5G stocks on the market now!
Viomi Technology is down 6.65% to 5.90
Nice little bump ^ so far today.......... Good to see some folks getting on board. Welcome!
"I have a lot of VIOT and I absolutely hope it does not evolve into Gamestop.Retail investors in Gamestop are not really investors, they just want to win by making hedge fund shorter to lose. They are zero sum carnivores.Long term investors don't want that. We want to win more money because our invested companies make good products and services and MAKE MORE MONEY. That's the sustainable way for high share price.Down with Gamestop, and day traders casino players. Leave VIOT alone."
Listened to the conference call and added another few hundred shares this morning for the long-haul! GLTA VIOT Investors
Read their last 6k! 142% increase in revenues year over year!
Viomi Technology is down 8.82% to 6.10
"Xiaomi added to the US blacklist of chinese stocks. we know that Viot deals alot with them. However VIOT also has the Smart TVs and data etc. CFO has quit. so as much as I hate to say, this is probably a sell for me for now. Buy it back at 3 USD in a few weeks"
Viomi Technology is up 4.96% to 5.50
Wow.. Billion dollar company for just a shade under 6 USD.. I'll be having some of that
"there was a launch EVENT thus month, anyone got a link?"
This stock will blow up . such a great company
VIOT reached an all time high at 11.13
"Joseph, it's linked to xiaomi getting industrial standard approved by MIIT today"
last chances before take off
Second stage booster kicking in....
VIOT is up 5.01% to 7.86
Viomi Technology is up 7.17% to 5.68
"Yup, buy before it jumps higher."
"Boy oh boy! This stock has been hammered since the earnings report, which wasn't bad at all. I hope there isn't something else out there that they know in China cause I am in! GLTA"
why balance sheet is blank on yahoo?
Sell sell sell !!!
It would be valuable is a few more analysts would cover this company. 1 is not enough to spread the word.
 Top Bullish Charts | October 2021  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"Just a few thoughts I shared on stocktwits...VIOT is seen by the market as an appliance manufacturer and only gross margin is taken into account. But in fact it is a technology company with high growth opportunities and the generation of additional sources of income. If they seize their opportunities and do many things right, Viomi could become something to the household industry like Apple in the cell phone market or Tesla in the automotive sector. But there is still a very long way to go until then.Compared to Haier or Midea, I don't see Viomi as having a technological edge at the moment. But what matters to me is where I see the company in 5-10 years. Even though there is always criticism that R&D spending is so low, I believe in the quality of the R&D people, especially the CEO. He worked for Midea for years and was responsible for the entire product development in the end. Someone like that doesn't just quit his well-paid job and build a new company from scratch, if he's not on fire every second. And that is what I want to see when I invest in a company. I invest in people and what they believe in. The comparison with Apple is mainly about creating an ecosystem and not necessarily about the technological advantage. Because Apple doesn't really have that either, they just create a better user experience.And even if there is no major growth in the coming years, this does not change the fact that the company is clearly undervalued at the current share price. If they reach annual sales of $1 billion in 2021 and a net margin of 5%, with a P/E ratio of 15, this equates to a market capitalization of $750 billion or a stock price of $10.70."
"Doubled my position this morning. I think the market recently is spooked by the new chinese IPOs with high valuation and expectation. I also like the backer and Lei Yun's interest in this company, which I think in a couple of years it will be bought out and consolidated into Xiao Mi. GLTA"
VIOT is down 7.82% to $8.60
This will be in the $20-30 range next year. To be precise I expect around $24-26. current valuation does not make sense. Their products will be the big next upgrade in many households.
"Surely, this company will have to be replaced by a U.S.-based non-subversive substitute which can produce surveillance-free software. No wonder the stock price is bargain-basement."
VIOT reached a new All Time Low at 8.11
https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/these-2-tech-stocks-are-grossly-undervalued-says-needham/
Has the lock up period expired?
Finally some volume. This ole boy may come off life support after all.
"Hold onto your horses we are not going anywhere as this is a friendly place to be invested.VIOT is looking like a $12-$13 stock right now from this last report that I just read.1Q highlights • Net revenues US $191.6M up 64.0% vs: same 1Q in 2020.• Gross margin was 21.1%, compared to 18.8% vs: same 1Q in 2020.• Shareholder value up 173.2% w/US $7.5M vs: same 1Q in 2020.• Non-GAAP net income increased by 106.8% w/ US $10M vs: same 1Q in 2020.• # users 5.1M vs: 3.7M same 1Q in 2020.• Dual product users up 20.4% vs: same 1Q in 2020."
Sold out my position previously and now back in at $4.69. Too busy trading everything else and finally have money to re-invest in this again. Surprise to see that it hasn't bounce back. Most all of my other investments had. I guess everyone is holding for the earning tomorrow...
That's what I am talking about. Selling half to lock in some quick profit and saving the rest for long-term investing. GLTA VIOT Investors
Wow! Up 8.54% today after yesterday's run up. Wondering what news we don't know about. But I am very happy with my shares average of $7.88 currently. Good Luck VIOT investor
new will be out this week..see yaa at $6.50
With Xiaomi having 30% market share in India anyone know how much sales does Viomi have in India?
Time to Buy Again. When investor finally discover this gem - the trend will reverse quickly. GLTA
see you at $6.50 on friday..news is coming any day now
just finished listening to the conference call. VIOT introduced their first 5G TV in China and roll out more product in their AC lines. The toughest Q1 is behind us and revenue still grown versus last year. Still one of the most undervalued ADR in the market! Brought more today. Good Luck to All Viomi Investors
"I just read the outlook part of the report and I am not that optimistic anymore... They did not provide the outlook for the whole year, just the 1st quarter. And they expect only a 17 to 25% growth. I say only, because the 2020Q1 was a very low base due to the corona virus. If there is such a low expectation for this quarter, possible the revenue growth will be lot smaller than expected in 2021. I am reducing my position in VIOT and shifting into QFIN"
undervalued stock. I can see $20 coming

"The start was chilling, that's directly affected my enthusiasm for Chinese stocks"
"Massive increases in revenue, income, earnings, new stores, product lines, etc.Way undervalued.Average target price $11.73"
So another resignation....this time the President... I'm beginning to have doubts here.
"I think this one just needs the trade deal with China to end favorably and it will take off. It is basically an unknown at this point and recieves no coverage. For those that don't know, Viomi is mainly engaged in the research, development and sales of IoT-enabled smart home products, including flagship line of smart water purification systems, smart kitchen products and other smart products. In addition, the Company provides complementary consumable products, including water purifier filters, as well as value-added businesses, including the sales of other products, such as water quality meters and water filter pitchers.Currently there is one ETF, (BOUT) that holds VIOT, a very recent addition, and they thought enough of it to make it their third largest holding at 1.44% of the fund. BOUT is a Innovator Breakout Opportunities ETF. If anyone has anymore info on VIOT, please post it and keep talking this one up^^^^."

"$VIOT and HMI. Two gems, even thougg VIOT has an outstanding future."
Easy forecast - 8 by the end of June. Greedy or fearful?
"Last quarter they gave a guidance for this quarter to be between RMB900 million and RMB950. They then delivered RMB1,255.6 beating their guidance by more than 30%. Either they're really bad at predicting, or are overly cautious. If the second is the case, expect next quarter revenue beat their modest 2.1% to 9.8% guidance either."
"Translated from the Xueqiu report:“ Yunmi (Viomi) Technology also has amazing financial fundamentals, which can be called a depression in the industry. Yunmi’s 2020 revenue is expected to reach 850 million U.S. dollars, while the market value is only 600 million U.S. dollars, and the PS market-to-sales ratio is 0.7, which is much lower than the 10-20 times PS of its peers, Stone Technology, which belongs to the Xiaomi ecological chain. At the same time, compared to at least 2019 Maintaining 30% revenue growth, positive company profits, cash equivalents of more than 100 million U.S. dollars, and continuous support from major shareholders such as Xiaomi Group and Lei Jun have laid the foundation for standing out in the fierce industry competition in the future.”"
can I buy their refrigerator only?
"This stock has a very good potential as we are entering a smart life... smart tv, smart light , etc...."
nice 3q !
Bought xiaomi earlier this year should of bought this stock as well - still is a good time to buy before they expand more in India & South East Asia
This stock is heavily shorted! Days to cover is 5.2 now. Good luck longs!

Viomi Technology is up 8.89% to 6.98
"Does anyone here believe that this company is a fraud? The price is so low, it reflects a near bankrupt company, not a growing one. Yet this stock just drops lower and lower everyday and management doesn't do anything to assure investor after the president resigned. Maybe the president saw the book and resign because this company is scamming and he is too scared of it.When Luckin Coffee scammed investors with fake financial result, did anybody in China get arrested and went to prison?Anybody here with any story and insight?"
"we will see $6.35 in a week , hold tight"
"In Germany they sell a lot of products, especially vacuum cleaners + accessory parts, under Viomi (not Xiomi) brand so their figures should be true.For this reason alone I would have expected much higher revenues, 1B in chinese currency is nearly nothing ($150 million) ..."
This can easily 10x this year! Their revenue will fly through the roof!! Very wel positioned for the future!
Viot is a fast growing and undervalued stock.
"Honestly, what does this stock have to do to rise?! Their earnings are fabulous and its extremely undervalued considering its growth also..."
VIOT is down -4.94% to 7.89
Viomi Technology is up 9.95% to 6.74
Have no idea why people are selling VIOT at these price level. Are the Chinese going to stop buying/changing their viomi water filter and systems (which is one of their biggest moneymakers) because of the coronavirus? Don't forget VIOT is profitable versus a lot of other ADR IPO. This along with their strong relationship with Xiaomi and their affordable 5G IOT products make it easy to invest at this price. Be greedy when others are fearful - I have been buying all morning :) GLTA!
I am very pleased with Viomi's results in the third quarter. I particularly appreciate the management's focus on increasing the company's profitability (closing less profitable stores and reducing production costs). The financial situation of Viomi is impeccable.

"Lol so cheap!! Bought 600 shares, if they continue racking them in (which they will since its a fast growing industry) the stock will go too the moon. Nice underground stock with low volume"

Nice gain the last 5 mins of the day -- 8.68 to 9.23. I hope this is good indication for the rest of the week.
Revised EPS estimate for this quarter is around $0.20. This stock is dirt cheap. This will rocket up on earnings release.
I think management is starting their $50M stock purchase. Also a couple of my Chinese ADR stocks are also green like BIDU and IQ. China is the first to recover and investors knows it. Smart money are flowing in there. GLTA VIOT Investors

"Their accounting is ""Non-GAAP"", they report that their ""Non-GAAP Net Income Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders of The Company"" declined 31.22%, YOY, as of Sept. 2020."
Is most of Viomi sales coming from xiaomi stores and website?
Market really looking at margins for this one... I guess their gross margin was a disappointment... Thinking selling my 1000 shares that I've bought at 6.1 average...

"VIOT is focusing on growth at this stage. It is still a profitable company. But the shift of going into major appliances like Fridge, 5G enable TV (new product) and Air Conditioner has less margin. They also discounted product in the popular 618 event.

Is there anyone who is waiting a higher price of this stock? I missed the opportunity of latest rise and buyed again at 8.15.

Viomi Technology is up 9.12% to 6.82
"Have been trading in-and-out of this stock since IPO. Very low volume stock and therefore share price can go up or down 15% in a single day. But fundamentally, Viomi is definitely getting better and better day-by-day. When IPO, my one worry was its tie with Xiaomi (since they receive a majority of income from them). But ever since then, they have diversified their revenue with own Viomi brand dramatically + their partnering/relationship with Xiaomi is still very strong and growing. Technically it has a pretty strong support at the $8.50 level The way to make profit with this stock is to buy under $9 and sell when it reach $10 (But keep some core position for long-term investing). Good Luck to All :)"
"No news, why moving so high?"
"Great future for Viomi. China's middle class population is booming. One belt & One Road, and RCEP, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and European Union China Free trade agreement, will bring Viomi to the moon."

You have got to be out of your mind to buy this at the all-time high on no news. It was $5 in December.
"The repurchase shows support for shareholders from the board which is nice. However, 10m is too much and this won't las. This repurchase cannot pump the price up for long. This stock is heavily shorted because market makers do not believe in the company fundamental.It will actually be better if they put the money into improving the products they offer so that their earnings can grow instead of temporary pumping the price with repurchase.I am quite certain the price will go down immediately after the repurchase because market makers (hedge funds, money managers, etc) have NOT changed their attitude toward this company. They don't believe in the company."

"The results are still good, but not great. The growth of 25% of revenue in 2020 is good, but the growth in the fourth quarter of 8,5% is not so great. They say it is because of dropping the low margin products. In fact, the profitability went up in Q4, so this makes sense. The best part is, they increased their R&D spending by around 42%, which is now about 4,5% of their Revenues, which is good. If you think what they have achieved so far (so many new products and patents) with their smaller budget, imagine what the R&D spending bring for the future. So in general, not great, but a solid investment. Looking at their margin growth, the profitability will only get better, and with the growing revenue and growing profitability, the stock price will also follow. So I am still quite optimistic and stay invested for the long haul."
Nice 20%+ day on solid volume (2x)...also no day trader sell-off at end of day. Starting to look like VIOT is getting interest on solid fundamentals
"PIR will bounce back very soon, in the meantime check out $VIOT, they are on an earnings call today, perhaps a good time to buy in. What do you think? We are thinking to invest."
soar like 2 weeks ago
More buying today. But due to the low volume of the Viomi Stock. I have been buying 100 shares each time and averaging down. Good Luck VIOT investors.

High volume up day again today! My cost average is $4.47 (my second largest position). High Five on those who brought toward the bottom. I see my investment doubling in less than 2 years and will hold them for the long-haul. GLTA VIOT Investors
"I don’t understand. The company with an annual revenue of $667million and growing at more than 70%, the market cap is in the $300millions. The share price should at least be in the upper teens or lower 20s."
I don't understand how the stock didn't go up after the earning report

"Brought more at $6.05 this morning. Does a profitable 5G related company investing like this look like a company that should be sitting at a all-time low share price (You can be the judge yourself)? The virus situation already stablize in China. This is a super low volume stock, so don't let them scare you out to sell.

"i.e. Should we be looking at companies like DE? There is going to be a strong agriculture market next year (based off this year's futures market), that looks good for both VIOT and DE; or should I say Microsoft and IoT. Both companies can prosper heading forward into the new year. Still hope for cheaper food and fine dining :)"
