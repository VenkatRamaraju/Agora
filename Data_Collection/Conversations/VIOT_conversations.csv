"This company is China home technology systems, wireless controls through voice commands, futures home, soild revenue at first half year 2018, the Ipo at 9, now 8, to me, this is the opportunity."
"in the conference call, they are mentioning a lot about ecommerce and advertising revenue models through ; 21face refregirators , tv screens and washing machine. This might be the next unicorn in few days I guess,they already reached more then 4.5 million customers!!!"
"Browskies, their net income is literally 10% of their market cap!!! With this much growth how is this not trading at 50$..."
"Whats the problem here? Im interested in this stock, bit something seems strange"
"Imagine not repurchasing your shares when they are worth dogpoo on the market, very smart! I will purchase more also"
You have got to be out of your mind to buy this at the all-time high on no news. It was $5 in December.
"And despite rapidly shrinking revenues expenses for selling and marketing will increase compared to the first half of this year (from Q2 earnings call transcript), so I assume Q3 earnings will be bad too ..."
I think management is starting their $50M stock purchase. Also a couple of my Chinese ADR stocks are also green like BIDU and IQ. China is the first to recover and investors knows it. Smart money are flowing in there. GLTA VIOT Investors
Sold out my position previously and now back in at $4.69. Too busy trading everything else and finally have money to re-invest in this again. Surprise to see that it hasn't bounce back. Most all of my other investments had. I guess everyone is holding for the earning tomorrow...
I wonder when investors start pay attention to this amazing company.
"Have been trading in-and-out of this stock since IPO. Very low volume stock and therefore share price can go up or down 15% in a single day. But fundamentally, Viomi is definitely getting better and better day-by-day. When IPO, my one worry was its tie with Xiaomi (since they receive a majority of income from them). But ever since then, they have diversified their revenue with own Viomi brand dramatically + their partnering/relationship with Xiaomi is still very strong and growing. Technically it has a pretty strong support at the $8.50 level The way to make profit with this stock is to buy under $9 and sell when it reach $10 (But keep some core position for long-term investing). Good Luck to All :)"

I don't understand how the stock didn't go up after the earning report
This will be in the $20-30 range next year. To be precise I expect around $24-26. current valuation does not make sense. Their products will be the big next upgrade in many households.
"I don’t understand. The company with an annual revenue of $667million and growing at more than 70%, the market cap is in the $300millions. The share price should at least be in the upper teens or lower 20s."
"Xueqiu wrote a bullish report, claiming they expect a 10x growth this year due to its leading position in the IOT devices market."
What is up with this stock? Zero coverage and it is up over 30% in the past few weeks
"Brought some shares at $4.85 today. Who is throwing their shares out at those prices? But I will take them, thank you."
"Just a few thoughts I shared on stocktwits...VIOT is seen by the market as an appliance manufacturer and only gross margin is taken into account. But in fact it is a technology company with high growth opportunities and the generation of additional sources of income. If they seize their opportunities and do many things right, Viomi could become something to the household industry like Apple in the cell phone market or Tesla in the automotive sector. But there is still a very long way to go until then.Compared to Haier or Midea, I don't see Viomi as having a technological edge at the moment. But what matters to me is where I see the company in 5-10 years. Even though there is always criticism that R&D spending is so low, I believe in the quality of the R&D people, especially the CEO. He worked for Midea for years and was responsible for the entire product development in the end. Someone like that doesn't just quit his well-paid job and build a new company from scratch, if he's not on fire every second. And that is what I want to see when I invest in a company. I invest in people and what they believe in. The comparison with Apple is mainly about creating an ecosystem and not necessarily about the technological advantage. Because Apple doesn't really have that either, they just create a better user experience.And even if there is no major growth in the coming years, this does not change the fact that the company is clearly undervalued at the current share price. If they reach annual sales of $1 billion in 2021 and a net margin of 5%, with a P/E ratio of 15, this equates to a market capitalization of $750 billion or a stock price of $10.70."
"Translated from the Xueqiu report:“ Yunmi (Viomi) Technology also has amazing financial fundamentals, which can be called a depression in the industry. Yunmi’s 2020 revenue is expected to reach 850 million U.S. dollars, while the market value is only 600 million U.S. dollars, and the PS market-to-sales ratio is 0.7, which is much lower than the 10-20 times PS of its peers, Stone Technology, which belongs to the Xiaomi ecological chain. At the same time, compared to at least 2019 Maintaining 30% revenue growth, positive company profits, cash equivalents of more than 100 million U.S. dollars, and continuous support from major shareholders such as Xiaomi Group and Lei Jun have laid the foundation for standing out in the fierce industry competition in the future.”"
"Massive increases in revenue, income, earnings, new stores, product lines, etc.Way undervalued.Average target price $11.73"
"This stock should be trading at $40 right now. At 10.50 it is less than its annual sale. However, anything above 12 is a struggle because money managers and hedge funds in the US have no love for this stock.They and their auto trading algorithm decide the price.The best thing to do for this stock is to dual list it on Shenzen. Chinese retail traders will love this stock more than they love the Roborock stock which has 10x market cap but less revenue and profit. Then 10x is a guarantee. They need to move this ticker back closer to home to gain greatness."
"VIOT is focusing on growth at this stage. It is still a profitable company. But the shift of going into major appliances like Fridge, 5G enable TV (new product) and Air Conditioner has less margin. They also discounted product in the popular 618 event. I am bullish on VIOT due to their 5G enable focus and how they are luring customers into their ecosystem (with short term pain).* Revenue is growing rapidly to 1.6 million RMB (an increased of 45.2%) comparing to same quarter of 2019* Profit Margin is 14.3% (compare to 26.6% in the same quarter of 2019)"

"In Germany they sell a lot of products, especially vacuum cleaners + accessory parts, under Viomi (not Xiomi) brand so their figures should be true.For this reason alone I would have expected much higher revenues, 1B in chinese currency is nearly nothing ($150 million) ..."
"Does anyone here believe that this company is a fraud? The price is so low, it reflects a near bankrupt company, not a growing one. Yet this stock just drops lower and lower everyday and management doesn't do anything to assure investor after the president resigned. Maybe the president saw the book and resign because this company is scamming and he is too scared of it.When Luckin Coffee scammed investors with fake financial result, did anybody in China get arrested and went to prison?Anybody here with any story and insight?"
"From the 6k:"" Outlook For the first quarter of 2019, the Company currently expects:Net revenues to be between RMB660 million and RMB690 million, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 99.5% to 108.6%."""
"Seems like there is no one following these guys...fast growth, profitable, very low valuation, micro-cap in a fast growing segment...what am I missing? Seems like this company could be a 10-bagger pretty easily. 35% insider ownership and Xiomi adds confidence...so what are the risks? Or has the market just not picked up on this one yet?"
"Soon other undervalued Chinese companies will follow $VIOT! Others where i'm bullish on are $MKD, $BEST and $KRKR! All of these have massive revenue streams and growth and will very soon multiply many times"
"Yup, buy before it jumps higher."
"Hold onto your horses we are not going anywhere as this is a friendly place to be invested.VIOT is looking like a $12-$13 stock right now from this last report that I just read.1Q highlights • Net revenues US $191.6M up 64.0% vs: same 1Q in 2020.• Gross margin was 21.1%, compared to 18.8% vs: same 1Q in 2020.• Shareholder value up 173.2% w/US $7.5M vs: same 1Q in 2020.• Non-GAAP net income increased by 106.8% w/ US $10M vs: same 1Q in 2020.• # users 5.1M vs: 3.7M same 1Q in 2020.• Dual product users up 20.4% vs: same 1Q in 2020."
"Pretty bad results though. I see that the company is trying to replace Xiaomi stuff with its own brands so that does make sense. However, they are not selling really good and sales guidance is bad too. How reliable are the figures?"
Viomi Technology is up 7.84% to 5.22
Listened to the conference call and added another few hundred shares this morning for the long-haul! GLTA VIOT Investors
Is most of their sales channel through Xiaomi? I’ve briefly read that Xiaomi stock is doing very well on the Hong Kong market.
"The repurchase shows support for shareholders from the board which is nice. However, 10m is too much and this won't las. This repurchase cannot pump the price up for long. This stock is heavily shorted because market makers do not believe in the company fundamental.It will actually be better if they put the money into improving the products they offer so that their earnings can grow instead of temporary pumping the price with repurchase.I am quite certain the price will go down immediately after the repurchase because market makers (hedge funds, money managers, etc) have NOT changed their attitude toward this company. They don't believe in the company."
"The results are still good, but not great. The growth of 25% of revenue in 2020 is good, but the growth in the fourth quarter of 8,5% is not so great. They say it is because of dropping the low margin products. In fact, the profitability went up in Q4, so this makes sense. The best part is, they increased their R&D spending by around 42%, which is now about 4,5% of their Revenues, which is good. If you think what they have achieved so far (so many new products and patents) with their smaller budget, imagine what the R&D spending bring for the future. So in general, not great, but a solid investment. Looking at their margin growth, the profitability will only get better, and with the growing revenue and growing profitability, the stock price will also follow. So I am still quite optimistic and stay invested for the long haul."
"BAD DECISION by the board. The board needs to realize, they cannot pump the price with repurchase. Company's valuation is not based on action from the board, but the executive team which is supposed to grow the company's earning.Even if they believe they are unfairly valued by the market, they should not buy back when they don't have much cash to begin with. They should try to dual list this stock in a fairer market. Since they went with VIE in Cayman, dual listing this stock in mainland China is going to be very complicated. So they should try to dual list in friendlier Hong Kong instead.If they continue with current strategy, then the hate from market makers in the US for this stock may very well turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy as the company keeps allocating resources/money/capital inefficiently (such as this share repurchase) and thus finally goes bankrupt."
