JD is the only chinese stock to own. Look at how BABA and Tencent is always in the crosshairs
Up $10. This is probably the biggest upwards run in the history of this stock.
They had some interesting insights about JD on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
How many times have I said this. If traded fairly this is easily a $120 per share stock!
"We are in the green, Jelly Bean.Who knows where we'll close, but for right now I'm a big fan of the price action. I fully expected to give back a large portion of yesterday's 14.4% gain. Every time we started getting dinged, someone stepped up to the plate and bought stock. As Ralph Kramden used to say, ""To the Moon Alice, to the Moon!"
Short Squeeze if this rises anywhere close to 72 or 73 today
"I’m glad the ceo addressed the big elephant in the room. CEO says JD has always been compliant, so nothing to worry about on the China crackdown."
Made first JD buy today
JD is showing a lot of relative strength in the sector.
JD is taking market share from BABA and PDD
interesting Cathie bought back JD shares-164k and selling more BABA
I am lovin it!! See you guys at $100.
"Viking Global Investors LP, revealed in their 13F recently released, they took a new stake in JD with adding 8,241,079 shares, currently worth $630,442,543."
"I'm going to buy ALOTTTT of this stock at market open no matter what, 1000+ shares no problem."
"Just bought some more cheap shares, thank you shorts to give me time to accumulate :)"

I added more at $62 and Baba at $154 yesterday. Just wish I added more than I did. Short Squeeze is here. Long and strong! Congrats longs!!!!
load up on those early call options and shares for next earnings gonna be next ride up
"between JD and BABA, if you could only pick one, which do people here prefer for growth, i'm curious."
JD up over 8% in HK. Let's see this trend carry over to US market on Tuesday AM. I think there will be many shorts that will have nightmare tonight and will panic buy in the am to cover. JD will be $120+ in few months as @Jimmy Da Saint said.
"the proposed chinese regulations actually HELPs JD. they are the one player that's be playing the fair game all along. paying taxes, hiring own delivery drivers as full time owners, no ""pick one or two"" , etc. it is very undervalued as well"
JD up another 6% in HK market open and should go much higher. Let's watch this trend carry over to US market on Wednesday. It would be great to see $85 or higher close tomorrow and march towards $100 by next week.Not a good week for shorties.
do you think 74 will hold?
Monster run today guys... we'll see you all in the triple digits here soon where this belongs.
"Opened up earnings call with confidence by addressing China regulation. They said that JD is complaining and will continue to grow. It’s been a tough few months, buying these lows and holding long"
Any news? Why is jd down premarket?
Bears missing? Where are you? Pls join the short so we can get more squeeze for more upside #pdd #jd #tme
"I have been out of JD since the $90s but have recently buying under $70 again. I suspect the Chinese government's recent rush of new policies is a sign things are coming to an end. The coming result may have up or downside surprise because of JD logistics IPO and JD health stock performance. So play safe.The current price is already very near to their HK IPO so I think there will be some support here. Also on the upside watch out for $73.5 (HK$285)and $77.5 (HK$300) - these are major resistance. No major funds are pushing beyond this. If $77.5 breaks, its a sure sign the recent spate of big brother meddling is over."
"Cathy Wood: What China is doing is what USA and EU are doing with big companies and she is optimistic about China. Hear it for yourself. Cathy Wood is loading up on TCEHY, PDD, JDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ssBnF4WN4&t=204s"
"I'm going to clue you guys into how media manipulation works. The china data is as follows : China July industrial production rose +6.4% y/y, (weaker than expectations of +7.9% y/y and the smallest increase in 11 months). China July retail sales rose +8.5% y/y, weaker than expectations of +10.9% y/y and the small increase 7 months.)You are seeing Chinese growth. Growth that would set a record in any other economy in the world. Try and purchase some cargo space on any item coming out of china. Price tripled or more on everything from hot tubs to copper (if you can get it) to consumer goods. I don't know where the bottom is but with every major drop I buy."
Reversal complete. See you at 120 by Christmas.
JD earnings tomorrow will be strong...I reiterate 65-70 close ...then the move back towards 100 year end
"Morgan Stanley revealed in their 13F released today, they purchased an additional 1,504,113 shares of JD."
Cathy Wood has been buying JD! Maybe next BABA!
Money rotating back into chinese stocks congrats longs for buying the dips and bearing the pain for couple of months. $100+ next earnings
"If most analyst targets above $125, why this is trading low? WHo is shorting?"
"Up 10% in Hong Kong trading - will be a 5% translation into markets today - here we go, congrats longs and excited to see shorts cover today."
JD crushed as always - great stock for long term holders- hard to know short side
"After selling Square at $80, I refused to missed out on a similar massive upside twice. My average cost 65$, so supper bullish on $JD. See you guys at $100 soon"
"I sold out of all my Chinese ADRs $BABA $JD $TCEHY a little more than a month ago. I've been so tempted to nibble a little, but I haven't...thankfully... I don't want to short them either. I'm just staying away. It's very tempting to own that growth, but I cannot have the rug the pulled out from me especially when I see it coming. I added to the growthiest (it's a word) and healthiest names in my portfolio... $TCNNF $CRLBF $GTBIF $CURLF $CCHWF and arb in $HRVSF . Plenty of growth ahead. Long runways. Thrives in any economic environment. Regarded as ""Essential"" during lock down. The uplist-related catalysts are massive....access for Robinhoard and the like...and all of the US-based institutions (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley) can finally BUY/OWN direct shares. Always buy and hold what the big boys and girls will be clamoring for. Don't sell it cheap...they'll pay up. The regulatory environment has their hands and feet bound..gagged and blindfolded...yet they continue to outperform. If you look at a 6 month chart, you'll see consolidation. BULLISH. gl2a."
