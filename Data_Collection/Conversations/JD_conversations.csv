Buy meme stocks. They could be heading back This is the time last yearBuy beaten down and short piled stocks those are bottomed outChinese stocks like $JD $PD $BIDu and even education stocks like$EDU $TAL $GOTU are the ones which could make you a ton$AMC $GME consolidation and leg up
This stock it’s supposed to be $150. Per share by now.
"There is a small chance that PBOC will cut short term interest rate tomorrow 9:30am (Beijing time). If they do so, expect to see major reversal of price tomorrow. I tend to see PBOC more hawkish than their US counterpart and I suspect they are also getting uncomfortable with RMB USD rate. Even if they don't, a signal that they would do it in the near future would send the sellers covering their positions."
"Assume every share you own of a chinese company is 1/3 owned by the state. Reduce your US multiple of earnings by 1/3. This is not a free market. It is a communist mercantile state, picking an chosing what ever it wants to do at any moment without consequence or constitution. Be careful. There are no bylaws for the communist state. They run it all and will decide on who wins and who loses and how much a domicile company market share they will allow to control. There isnt a rule book. Be Careful."
JD up over 8% in HK. Let's see this trend carry over to US market on Tuesday AM. I think there will be many shorts that will have nightmare tonight and will panic buy in the am to cover. JD will be $120+ in few months as @Jimmy Da Saint said.
Monster run today guys... we'll see you all in the triple digits here soon where this belongs.
"Warren Buffet: Buy when everyone is fearful. Best time to scoop up china stocks that are having huge dips. When US market crashes, the funds in US will flow to China. By then, china stocks like JD will be all time highs again. It will happen within this year."
"At first quarter's end, a total of 75 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -16% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 90 hedge funds with a bullish position in JD a year ago. When it goes to the mid 50's then buy it!"
"I remember buying $LKNCY when it was just below $2 a share. Lots of people said ""Bankrupt"" China stock"" and so on.Today. over 600%+ I still have it.I look at $TAL and EDU and wonder... Will these be the same? A little more bumps then start its up hill?Are these worth the gamble?I used to have $IQ during IPO and sold it as it flew up. Sad to see it where it is today.I still have $BABA really disappointing to see where that it as well. Also hold $WISH at below $8 a share.Had $YY $BILI $JD $BIDU sold for good profits as well. My question is... Are Chinese stocks worth it at this point? Seems they are hated by not only Wall-Street but their own country as well. Any comments?"
JD crushed as always - great stock for long term holders- hard to know short side
"Some Folks here arguing JD better better - but realize they have two different models. BABA is more b to b, and JD is consumer much like Amazon = a lower profit margin. Just be sure what you are investing in."
It seems like China is going to gradually intentionally erode all the existing Chinese stocks value on the US Stock Exchange & the SEC will set their twirling their thumbs; looking the other way the entire time.
"I thought that PDD's 1.5 billion to Chinese farmers was a masterstroke PR move in today's climate. I wonder if we will follow suit in some fashion....or even if something like a dividend would be viewed by the govt. as a valued form of ""giving back""?"
these large price moves are going to margin call shorts soon gonna be nice run up
Markets will sell off today...JD will follow
Buy the dip and make profit afterward......
To all those who believed in their conviction . To all those who averaged and used the panic to their advantage. Cheers to all of us . We made a killing today
"In case anyone cares, January 23, strike 85 calls are UP, not down. What does that tell you?"
"KEY POINTS • China will continue to allow Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. as long as they meet listing requirements, China's securities regulator told brokerages late Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. • China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai held a virtual meeting with major investment banks on Wednesday, the source said. • Chinese stocks listed in Asia and the U.S. — including big names like Alibaba and Tencent — plunged in the last several days as Chinese authorities increased scrutiny on tech companies over monopolistic practices and data security."
"that their core principle is to give 2/3 away, 1/3 goes to reinvestments and zero to shareholders, actually they get diluted"
"the proposed chinese regulations actually HELPs JD. they are the one player that's be playing the fair game all along. paying taxes, hiring own delivery drivers as full time owners, no ""pick one or two"" , etc. it is very undervalued as well"
Some insights on PDD and the earningshttps://youtu.be/vMupDWAcyNQ$baba $jd $shop $litb $vips
"Yet JD's stock now trades at just 27 times forward earnings and less than one times this year's sales, making it much cheaper than many other e-commerce companies with comparable growth rates. Should investors ignore the constant noise and fear about Chinese tech stocks and simply buy JD, or should they wait for the storm to pass before accumulating more shares?"
Shorting at these levels would be financial suicide. Any positive news will boost $kweb and chinese inet shares by at least 15%. Also seeing a bottom forming. Today's action is pretty bullish for the sector. $baba $iq $doyu $momo $huya $yy $pdd $bili $jd $jfu $wei $lx $qd $bili $qtt $mkd
BABA reports next week so it will set the tone for chinese stocks bullish sentiment
"Good morning all. I haven't been following JD. Can't help to notice almost 50% drop from 52w high. Is now a good time to get in or should I wait a bit more? any input is appreciated, thanks!"
Hong Kong likes the results!
some decent buying action today after being oversold for no reason again
mostly everything Cathie touches turns bad so now with her gone JD can return to new highs
JD earnings tomorrow will be strong...I reiterate 65-70 close ...then the move back towards 100 year end
Now this has become ARKK puppy
I wonder how something like a dollar a share dividend would be received by those in the CPC? Would something like that get the bullseye off our back?
Great figures!
Heavy discount prices
"Got awfully silent here, either because I muted so many $5/h stock bashers or they have bailed themselves. $doyu $huya $baba $iq $qtt $pdd $momo $uxin $kxin $lx $yy $bili $jd $jt $wei $jfu $aihs $qd $bidu"
Forward PE of 4 ........
"Earnings on a Monday morning? That is a bold move, the numbers better be good or else you will have 5 days of red in a week. [Bullish]"
You never know what China gov. going to do.
"Board before it's too late, train is leaving.... "
Could the CCP be shorting China ADR stocks?
it will be in the 50's in 2 weeks then I buy.
"between JD and BABA, if you could only pick one, which do people here prefer for growth, i'm curious."
Heading to right direction after all
"China reporting on $BIDU had only positive things, even reporting that Covid was a boon for their business. Improving business and social value.US reporting on Baidu would make you think the company was going to die. What is going on?$BABA $JD $TCEHY"
Been short this #$%$ since 7/22 @ 75 x 2500 short shares. Monday this #$%$ drops to 50 range or lower as the earnings will miss big. Also chinese crackdowns are hurting these stocks. Will see 40's where i cover. Enjoy the drop like i have.
sell today buy cheap tomorrow sellllllll
"The economics of china is highly manipulated so do all the financial reports of chinese companies. JD has a good fundamatal on paper, but just on paper."
"Some interesting things to note. I think recent moves have mostly been sector wide,meaning all China e-commerce shared moved together. but starting to see signs that JD will pull away from pack. I mentioned that Suning is becoming insolvent. Also regulatory body has issued new draft revelations basically targeting the practices of BABA and PDD, they will have a hard time.moving forward. BABA wouldn't report it's results for 618, but this will show up in results soon and we will see a big divergence in share price"
Jd should benefit from regulations (even though minor). Jd is the smaller of the eCommerce and platform players. Growth is still there
JD to the moon:-)
"It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood! Closed on strength. Up $.92 for the day, and I’m thrilled."
Going Lower todays folks....67ish Another crackdown
Lets start the march back to 100!!
Cathy Wood has been buying JD! Maybe next BABA!
This looks more familiar
"This will be $100 by EOY, thanks for all the discount shares to everyone overreacting to China fear"
I thinK the stock trades much lower tomorrow...Gap down......bull trap today GLTA
"Dodo back in the CCP’s cross hairs! There’s only one safe Chinese play to invest in and that’s JD!You know why? Liu Kang loves Xi and Xi loves Kang…Look it up, theyre good pals!"
We all know this is a 150 stock but with China it could go to zero. I’m a gambler and think long term it’ll hit 300
People are trying to cover the calls at 70 before the big drop.
"Was Wall St/CNBC talking heads calling these stocks ""uninvestable"" the buy signal? I understand they had good reason for their FUD but they may also be knowing things going behind the scenes with respect to China which the average investor may not know. They instead chose to present the worst case scenario to their viewers to dump their stocks and benefit their clients' short positions."
Why is this going down when the big ones ($BABA $JD $TECHY $BIDU) are going up?
This company is highly undervalued on technicals....Should pop back to 100 very soon ....It will happen fast.....Load up
"I'm going to buy ALOTTTT of this stock at market open no matter what, 1000+ shares no problem."
Nice gap fill. Problem now is there is a huge gap to fill on the downside. JD is a stock that seems to always fill it’s technical gaps
Get finv https://finance.yahoo.com/news/finvolution-group-reports-second-quarter-074500422.html
loaded up more going back to 70 soon as usual
Jd just the beginning. Look at seed 3.7 million share float.when their news hits it will be back to over $20 a share again
looks like some buyers finally woke up
Chinese JD BABA JKS are looking good!
"After selling Square at $80, I refused to missed out on a similar massive upside twice. My average cost 65$, so supper bullish on $JD. See you guys at $100 soon"
Green day tomorrow. Let's go!
Made first JD buy today
Crawling back to $80...smooth and steady. Let's go!
"Thanks for the steep discount. Double my position today. Nothings changed, JD has great fundamentals, over 500 million users, doing share buy backs. Been selling online since 2004, nothing is going to change except for more growth. JD has been helping and donating to Areas of disaster in China, they are good standing with the Chinese govt, and will continue to be."
"Opened up earnings call with confidence by addressing China regulation. They said that JD is complaining and will continue to grow. It’s been a tough few months, buying these lows and holding long"
what is the hong kong to Nasdaq equivalence?
"The level of unsubstantiated fear mongering by the media and high level investors emberrasses me. Somehow by implementing procedures to limit fraud and improve income equality, China is now a liability and a monstrous state? Huh, what did the US do in 2009 to address bank fraud? Anyway, JD is about 7x undervalued at the moment. Forget about BEKE and BZUN and VIPS. Those are lightyears away from actual value."
Is this a good time to buy in or should I wait until it goes to $50 ?
"I bought at 84 dollars, kep averaging down. account is blown away. what to do ?"
Price target for this VIE system shell stock is actually zero..the SEC is forcing China companies to disclose that this isnt actually the real stock....oh oh
"LOL at the sudden appearance of bashers just before market open. You guys trying to crash this down at open so you can quickly jump into a good entry price? Look, you missed the runup. Just jump in and don't look back. If you trash talk this to get a low entry, you might accidentally cause everyone to panic sell and then you just burn yourselves."
I see an opportunity... start buying now ...
Short Squeeze if this rises anywhere close to 72 or 73 today
Cathie bought more JD today.
Great buying opportunity....Will be buying shares here....This is when you get rich....Rare opportunityfor a truly undervalued stock regardless of the geopolitical
Can someone explain how this has only 5% market cap of Amazon with just as many customers. Is it all distrust in CHINA?
Great day for JD again guess I'll hold till we reach highs again. Hedge funds loading up each day
I added more at $62 and Baba at $154 yesterday. Just wish I added more than I did. Short Squeeze is here. Long and strong! Congrats longs!!!!
P/E= 14 
I love it...Hope it goes even lower.....Bargain sales gonna make me rich.....building a nice position....Patience is a virtue
JD is looking to get into Europe? https://www.retaildetail.eu/en/news/property/chinese-online-retailer-jdcom-planning-conquer-europe-zeebrugge
You go JD you are a beauty!
earnings on Monday? JD hasn't really been attacked by the government. I am nervous about earnings. but...nice growth company for the price
Back to $110 where it belongs. I’ve Been buying during red days. 
"I sold out of all my Chinese ADRs $BABA $JD $TCEHY a little more than a month ago. I've been so tempted to nibble a little, but I haven't...thankfully... I don't want to short them either. I'm just staying away. It's very tempting to own that growth, but I cannot have the rug the pulled out from me especially when I see it coming. I added to the growthiest (it's a word) and healthiest names in my portfolio... $TCNNF $CRLBF $GTBIF $CURLF $CCHWF and arb in $HRVSF . Plenty of growth ahead. Long runways. Thrives in any economic environment. Regarded as ""Essential"" during lock down. The uplist-related catalysts are massive....access for Robinhoard and the like...and all of the US-based institutions (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley) can finally BUY/OWN direct shares. Always buy and hold what the big boys and girls will be clamoring for. Don't sell it cheap...they'll pay up. The regulatory environment has their hands and feet bound..gagged and blindfolded...yet they continue to outperform. If you look at a 6 month chart, you'll see consolidation. BULLISH. gl2a."
JD ups ups and only ups from here!
9618.HK is up 6.71% to 298.80
"I bought this at 77, going to keep holding - hoping I made the right decision. The financials are great, let’s hope it starts to reflect in the stock price soon."
Ark's bought a lot of JD logistics the last two days. It is at a big discount atm.
This is a $30 stock.
JD is the only chinese stock to own. Look at how BABA and Tencent is always in the crosshairs
$JD should bought JD over $BABA
"Just bought some more cheap shares, thank you shorts to give me time to accumulate :)"
Chinese JD shares are through the VIE system of shell companies to circumvent Chinese law against foreign ownership...the ADR stocks are not the real shares....value equals zero
$BABA $IQ $NIO $JD $BILI $TME $MOMO Nice bloodbath!!
"i had 2 trades today coin plus 1.5% and umc plus 1.0 % both skim trades made about 300$ on 28,000$ trades all done in 20 minutes each trade best way to trade 2% max on any trade try it you wont go back to buy and hold"
Chinese Government now softening their tone realizing that they couldnegatively impact China's Economic Growth and even Public Sentimentif they continue hurting Tech Companies who employ Millions of Chineseworkers. JD who alone has over 1/3 Million Employees is up 9% today.
Up $10. This is probably the biggest upwards run in the history of this stock.
So they think JD is a Fruad now?
Some regulation comin out for tutoring companies unrelated and unaffected to JD thats causing a drag on chinese stocks today. buy the dip!
Holy Schniekes!This is nice. Was a nice sight to see over my first cup of coffee.
Anyone loading the truck?
"Last three days ARKX has added 2,706,600 shares of JD logistics (2618HK) to their fund. Right now its trading for around 35HKD (4.50usd) at a market cap of 215billionHKD (27million usd). Tech-wise one of the best logistic networks out there."
ty panic sellers for cheap shares long term after all the regulation is done rising back to new highs or if US China relation talks end up being good
"Article on zero hedge! Baba is always going to be in the CCP’s cross hairs!It’s time that Liu Kang becomes the face of Logistics in China & a global scale!Jack Ma ""Behaved Too Much Like An American Entrepreneur"" For The Chinese Communist Party's Liking”"
"Panic buying on the sentiment reversal and large short covering will bring us up quicker then we fell... if you dont want to buy great Chinese businesses at these cheap prices, go buy overvalued FAANG which by the way will be milked by the US government sooner or later... I am buying every dip and holding long term, thats the way you play it"
The current price to book value of this is 0.52 . This is so undervalued
"SELL $BABA, BUY $JD."
So many hedge funds have turned bullish now what happend to the regulation issues? lol. These analysts are always wrong and just flip flop to the money making side
Loving this! Diamond Handsssssss! Let’s go JD!
"Huge buying volume in the first 15 minutes, and last hour of trading. I think a large whale has joined us."
Hidden Gem that Xi Ping Loaded a loaded last few days. Now he will ride this elephant.
Alibaba is focussing more on tier 3/tier 4 cities with new business models and lowering cost for their merchants and upgrading the platform. Alibaba is 10 USD below March 2020 low. What about JD?
"Some mildly concerning geopolitical news. First, Chinese economy is contracting. Secondly, China is isolating itself more and clamping down on its people. So just be alert. Also don’t forget KWEB China internet Etf that performs great along with individual stocks."
Bail !!!
SEC just demand all Chinese firms reveal about investors risk.
huge up day and volume is 3 times the average
"This is strange AF. What changed fundamentally from yesterday to today? I’m thrilled the stock is up, but I’d be more thrilled to know the reason why. I realize sentiment towards China and Chinese stocks is awful right now, but we’re talking about the biggest player in the e-commerce segment of the most populous country on the planet that sports a PE of 13 and has perhaps the most sophisticated and efficient logistics network in the world. We might not see this stock reach its true potential next week, next month or next year, but at some point in the future, this stock should soar."
"Wow, what an impressive Q2 report. JD is taking market share away from Baba every quarter. Baba core e-commerce revenue growth shrank to only 14 percent! JD is winning on the luxury front, as LVMH and its companies signed on . it's winning in lower tier cities with jingxi app, with MAU at about same as PDD now. JD logistics added 450 warehouses in a year! I've never seen one company dominate across the board, from high end to low end. it is the largest retailer, logistics, online pharmacy. not to mention groceries, auto, industrial MRO, used goods, property, JD tech etc. Amazon used to be my favourite investment, but this company is just so well run. the regulatory changes benefit JD and hurt Baba and PDD as it cracks down on anti competitive Baba practices (like forcing vendors to choose platforms) and mispricing by pdd. this is a juggernaut that's just starting to flex its muscles"
"Maybe I am off base, but feel this is an over reaction and some manipulation here. I keep reading concerns of the Government taking over these companies but yet, Apple, Nike, and other US companies are growing like crazy in that region of the world. US companies sees this region as where future growth is. I don't think the China government would kill it's own tech darlings and allow US companies to grow. I feel this is more of the government implementing rules to address issues they have seen. There can be more future short term pain, but long term, I see these China tech giants providing a better ROI."
"Why would anyone buying chinese stocks, when the country is in a cold war with US(seems like it) or proxy war?Befriending taliban in afghanistan, Iran, venezuela , Rusia?Does this makes sense to you?"
i bet cathie will buy when this hits 90$+
$JD announced 6 hours ago they increase wages by 14% in next two years probably indication that their performance was pretty decent in last quarter
JD.com is down 5.15% to 66.26
so many shorts here cant wait till the day u have to cover. Big short squeeze when all the china hate and fud gets thrown out
"$70 today , still way cheaper ."
JD stock in America is a shell company stock...not the real stock...China forbids foreign ownership of their stocks...didnt you read the memo?
under $150 $Baba$100 $Bidu $JD $40You welcome!
long term this company is solid and still cheap
JD will go back to 80 again this week.
52 week PT 642$ ????
the more spam we see the more this is gonna rocket 
"JD trading up 11% in HK. I hope it carries over to US. You shorties are toast. For those that could not stomach the big drop and sold, you should have held."
"Chinese stocks like JD, baba and baida are undervalued. Bookvalue and cash per share are lower than the stock price. Easy money..."
good riddance of Cathie for causing the big selloff these 2 days. Now only the true believers buy the dip and hold because china is a world power that will take over US
"As we continue to make acquisitions, at what point might it be prudent for us to start paying a modest dividend...before we get ""too big""?"
it will bounce back
Wonder what fund ran this up with 8 million share purchase. Hint. It's a company that did the same to HOOD. was at 40 went to 80+ and 4 days later back down to 40's.
notice theres no selling volum?
Have always been bullish on JD!
"If most analyst targets above $125, why this is trading low? WHo is shorting?"
Panic sell off - way over done. I would hold now and buy more shares - it’s just a matter of time until this ends and this goes way back up. Just look at historical. I purchased last sell-off at $20.
Xi will crush all the Chines ADR shell company stocks in America.....over 1.5 trillion lost already
Bears missing? Where are you? Pls join the short so we can get more squeeze for more upside #pdd #jd #tme
"I honestly do not understand who is throwing off these shares at such a price, the company has been growing by trembling for the last 5 years, the report is coming soon in mid-August, and there I am sure that everything will be fine. today I will make a detailed analysis of the situation on my blog http://pyatilistnik.org/"
Sell this share is going to 50 -> 40 -> 20.CCP are after JD.
"Morgan Stanley revealed in their 13F released today, they purchased an additional 1,504,113 shares of JD."
"This company has 87usd per share in cash an only 14usd per share in debt and stock is just 65, big bargain"
got some more
interesting Cathie bought back JD shares-164k and selling more BABA
eMarketer report suggests that BABA market share dropped below 50% for first time. JD is continuously taking market share away. the next few quarters will be interesting!
"Oddly enough, while this is excellent upwards price action, JD, in particular has substantially more upside over the next couple of years. I'd be buying this rally."
any predictions for Monday?
"I’ll keep repeating. This is a $100 stock trading at a 30% discount. This is how you make real money! There’s not many of these in the market & not many are aware of this company still! Who knows how much more downside their is, maybe 10 points tops (without a market crash Ofcourse). Still, the upside is too great to ignore at these levels!"
"If you think about it, this has to be capitulation. Trading close to book based on nothing but China fears.... Once DIDI fine comes, all China stock will reverse hard (reverse sell the news).$baba $jd $didi"
Chinese Corruption will turn JD into mush.....Can't trust them...Look what happened to the big coffee company Lukin last year....the Chinese are notrious for cooking the books
really need JD to blowout earnings and stock buybacks to bring confidence back
JD is showing a lot of relative strength in the sector.
"Up 10% in Hong Kong trading - will be a 5% translation into markets today - here we go, congrats longs and excited to see shorts cover today."
The financials are great. What is going on? This is a strong company.
Shorts be like
98 in few days ! Actual PT is 130
What gives!? Let hope they knock earnings out of the park or it may be trashed even more.
A $1 bump on solid earnings 
good volume on an up day in a down market
"As of now, JD is up 4.3% at HK market ."
People who bought China stocks got burned so bad....now its your turn to get crushed
Shorts better cover now
do you think 74 will hold?
Wow I had thought I’d mad a mistake selling between $85-90 range $JD and other Chinese stocks continue to drop I really want to buy back in soon! Pure fear mongering currently
$DIDI will carry us all$TCEHY to 80+$BABA to 240+$BIDU to 210+$IQ to 18+$TME to 18+$HUYA to 18+$DOYU to 7+$BILI to 120+$JD to 80+$KWEB $PDD $YY gunna fly too.
Any news? Why is jd down premarket?
20 PE ratio Tencent or 25 PE JD what do you guys think has more value and is more diversified? I like to hear opinions
"I have 1000 shares with an average of 71, I'm sure we will see above $ 77 per share next week and maybe we will take 80+ ahead of the report due out on August 18th. I will invest the resulting profit in developing my IT blog http://pyatilistnik.org/"
How many times have I said this. If traded fairly this is easily a $120 per share stock!
$BABA $JD $TCEHY $BILI another 20% haircut will be the bottom!!
"The valuation of JD is a function of risk. In this case political risk. As such, the share price must be adjusted accordingly. (This takes into account only one risk factor i.e. political risk.) Nobody on this board can say what is happening in China at the CCP level. Sure, you can always say that this is a temporary situation. And you can say that AIEs are good investments. But an AIE is a Chinese shell. As the US government threatens to investigate and make regulatory demands on Chinese companies, even delist some Chinese 'strategic' stocks, the CCP has countered by destroying the wealth of Americans invested in Chinese AIEs. It is war and don't be so cavalier about your buy low philosophy. Understand what you own. You own a Chinese shell company controlled by the CCP and you think you are going to make a fortune playing the China game. Good luck."
in 20 minutes 8M shares were bought.
"Very few are investing in Chinese stocks no matter how good the earnings are, people don't like the latest developments."
I think JDcom will hit $120 a share by December.
"Viking Global Investors LP, revealed in their 13F recently released, they took a new stake in JD with adding 8,241,079 shares, currently worth $630,442,543."
Good news

Reversal is imminent now. Institutional investors are starting to accumulate slowly in order to not push the price up to fast. $yy $iq $baba $jd $pdd $momo $huya $kxin $uxin $doyu
"Tencent is more diversified, own large chunk of JD even, so good play I think, although they probably have a much higher regulatory risk than JD."
Completely obliterated in Hong Kong again. This thing is beyond dead.
China Tech Stocks Rise as Analysts Turn Positive After Selloff(Bloomberg) -- Chinese internet stocks rallied in Hong Kong on Tuesday after some brokers started to turn optimistic on the sector and said investors were making an attempt to find a bottom in prices after the recent selloff.
Remember..these arent the real shares..thru the VIE system this is a shell company stock to circumvent Chinese laws against foriegn ownership...beware
What a Fn joke this has become!!!! Zero logical reason what so ever for this constant clip!Can’t invest in anything a China anymore. Not even worth this aggravation for the average retail investor. Can’t wait to blow out of this pig when break even & will never look back!US & European companies only for this guy! Done with this political tension & their insane government that’s devouring their own companies!
"Can anyone recommend a good dentist. We're getting our teeth kicked in. Is there a fundamental problem with the company, or is this all driven by the deteriorating relationship with China and China seeming to go after their own strongest companies?"
JD needs to seperate from the other chinese tech stocks driving it lower. No regulatory scrutiny at all
Comrades. No fear making money going excessively shorting Chinese stock especially when Emperor Xi wants stock prices to be lower. Get ready for another weekend of nationalization coming from our Beloved Comrade Xi
If Amazon trading at $3k+ JD can bring us back to $100+ next earnings.
"We are in the green, Jelly Bean.Who knows where we'll close, but for right now I'm a big fan of the price action. I fully expected to give back a large portion of yesterday's 14.4% gain. Every time we started getting dinged, someone stepped up to the plate and bought stock. As Ralph Kramden used to say, ""To the Moon Alice, to the Moon!"
Money rotating back into chinese stocks congrats longs for buying the dips and bearing the pain for couple of months. $100+ next earnings
bullish divergence MACD and oversold ..time to load up..

BABA earnings show a slowing of growth in the midst of a BABA spending spree designed to accelerate growth. Gonna be a bad day for Chinese stocks......AGAIN!
People seems to be shorting what woods buying now. In a bull market her picks were doing so great. Now they are getting hit. Just my observation.
Haha Shorts got burned and now their spamming the board with nonsense. JD to $150
$JD Target Lowered by CLSA Buy USD 110 » USD 102Target Lowered by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 95 » USD 85 Reiterated by Benchmark Buy USD 112 » USD 102
Take a look at the huge amount of calls expiring on october 15 ‘21 (strike 115). A party is going to lose money big time 
Price on Sales 0.13Enterprise value / EBITDA 1.9 (growth in triple digit on bottom line)Buy and come back in a year
"Buy good companies at good prices. That’s this right here. Some regulatory issues, but I believe downside to be very limited at these prices. Sadly, upside as well in the near term. Get yourself some"
Rob suddenly disappeared
$120 stock trading at a 40 point discount. And this is fair value to!!!
"JD is going to make me so much money! Holding since the ‘trade war’ when it was down at $18, next stop $100 after earnings. Nothing can stop this company. The CCP wants China to win and hurting their own companies won’t help them do that!"
A hole Xi's new regulations are sending Chinses stocks DIDI BABA JD BIDU JKS NIO XPEV LI to their best bargain prices!
Remember how US fabricated those stories about JD CEO to drive the stock down? Well it is happening again. This time it's a full market attack
ADDED 120 pieces at 65.80 no regrets.
Stay away from anything that Cathie Woods touches. Every stock ARKK has in their portfolio is down YTD by an average of 30%
"Their core principle is to give everything away, but nothing to shareholders, look it uo"
I am down almost 1200 USD on this stock . Not sure when this stocks will hit 80$
"What happened today:China: We are “discussing” reducing the burden on parents for tutoring and schooling services including mandating less homework and lower tutoring fees. I’m addition, we are discussing moving tutoring corporations to non-profits to reduce the price gauging on the educational system in China to support the disparity in those who can and can’t afford tutoring.USA media ($1T in student debt btw): China wants you to lose all your money, they love it. They will nationalize all companies and make everything free!!!!The media and FUD is insane but typical of US.im 100% in $JD for the long run"
I am lovin it!! See you guys at $100.
"Sol -- yesterday@Dr, it is at the end of the summary, it sais ""1y target est $642.64""Where can I find this summary/report. Can you post the link?"
Earnings on 23rd August. Fun times.
"Cathy Wood: What China is doing is what USA and EU are doing with big companies and she is optimistic about China. Hear it for yourself. Cathy Wood is loading up on TCEHY, PDD, JDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ssBnF4WN4&t=204s"
"I've recapped $BABA $BIDU $HUYA and $DOYU earnings, plus collated all the latest news to do with China here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og7ccmpZyO4 (the news also apply to $TCEHY $JD $YY etc.)I was bullish on China last month, but the evidence strongly suggests that the market is going in the opposite direction. 5-year plan, SEC warnings, bad Chinese economy results. We've seen a lot of legal restrictions put in place and everything suggests that it will get even worse. I'm out of any Chinese stocks for the next few months, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the situation. Thoughts?"
"How does JD compare with BABA ? Holding 400 shares , I find no point in taking a big loss buy selling it . Will things improve for this stock ?"
"wow, the CCP has rattled the china ADR stocks costing US investors probably half a trillion $ for the Q2. If if the CCP committees short the stocks, they must become billionaires. $bidu $baba $pdd $didi $tal. That is the problem when power is in few hands. GL"
Chinese stocks like JD BABA BIDU DIDI JKS are trading at their best bargain price.
think im going to jump in @ 7 am tom. so its prob tanking
China will be the leader over US in a few years with the fast regulation and implementation of its digital dollar. Short term its gonna hurt with all the China fud but will pay off well long term
"I'm going to clue you guys into how media manipulation works. The china data is as follows : China July industrial production rose +6.4% y/y, (weaker than expectations of +7.9% y/y and the smallest increase in 11 months). China July retail sales rose +8.5% y/y, weaker than expectations of +10.9% y/y and the small increase 7 months.)You are seeing Chinese growth. Growth that would set a record in any other economy in the world. Try and purchase some cargo space on any item coming out of china. Price tripled or more on everything from hot tubs to copper (if you can get it) to consumer goods. I don't know where the bottom is but with every major drop I buy."

I just don’t see this being able to ascend higher for the rest of this year. Our political tensions with China has never been worse in the history of our countries & the CCP continues to be merciless on their own as well!Just the worst time to be a China bag holder (Great time to start smallPositions over the course of the rest of the year).
Months ago I thought this would be $100 stock by earnings. So disappointing investing in China. Will probably think of trimming Jd along with a few other Chinese stocks if we get a rally
shorts got caught wit their pants down oops
35% discount on the e-commerce company in Asia. Buy with both hands. GS PT upgrade to $130 in last 2 weeks.
We can forget about Jack Ma and Ant Group now. It's about fundamentals and macro.YTD Price Performance$XPEV -18%$NIO -18%$BABA -21%$TCEHY -21%$JD -29%$PDD -54%
"Love that the professional money managers have to disclose all their moves now, we can see them dumping at 62-64 and then buying at 70+. Ignore the commentary, stick with the fundamentals, value #s > words, you will always be rewarded over time."
So apparently JD is an education company. Hmm here I thought they were an online retail company.
"I have been out of JD since the $90s but have recently buying under $70 again. I suspect the Chinese government's recent rush of new policies is a sign things are coming to an end. The coming result may have up or downside surprise because of JD logistics IPO and JD health stock performance. So play safe.The current price is already very near to their HK IPO so I think there will be some support here. Also on the upside watch out for $73.5 (HK$285)and $77.5 (HK$300) - these are major resistance. No major funds are pushing beyond this. If $77.5 breaks, its a sure sign the recent spate of big brother meddling is over."
added 1k more shares hope this is the final bottom before earnings
all of you selling because of fear need to buy the 500 and not play this game.
"Six months ago, one could have bought Tencent for about $900 billion. Today, one could almost buy both Tencent and Alibaba for the same money. $TECHY $BABA $BIDU $JD $DIDI $WB"
Too late to sell
Expecting to see JD touch $61 today from previous trends
It's going to see new lows. May be $30-32 is reality.
The darkest moment is right before dawn... the best buying opportunity is when everyone is fearful and stocks are heavily oversold. $yy $baba $huya $doyu $momo $iq $qtt $uxin $pdd $jfu $jt $qd $kweb $jd $bili
Dropping in hk. What gives??!!
JD up another 6% in HK market open and should go much higher. Let's watch this trend carry over to US market on Wednesday. It would be great to see $85 or higher close tomorrow and march towards $100 by next week.Not a good week for shorties.
JD getting into cargo airline business and stock still undervalued cmon hedge funds step up the buying
9618.HK is up 5.91% to 258.00
"What doesn't make sense is that other Chinese stocks are in the green (DIDI, NIO, UXIN, etc), but BABA and JD are getting hammered. Why fear for ecommerce stocks but seemingly none for EV/ride share?"
What is going on with this stock. JD is a .
almost back up to my buy price months ago. this will be over 200 in three years.
Not sure how I ever traded without (http://financialdeals.tech)! Their daily emails give me all the info I need to make the best decisions when it comes to trades!
Could be buy opportunity tomorrow. Honk Kong down.
Now the SEC is after the Chinese firms....oh oh
FOMO and TINA around the corner for the chinese tech space. Mark my words... $BABA $JD $TCEHY $DIDI $TSLA HUYA $YY $IQ $MOMO $ BILI $PDD$kweb UP ^DJI ^GSPC ^IXIC DOWN
This is the worst performing stock in my portfolio
"I’m glad the ceo addressed the big elephant in the room. CEO says JD has always been compliant, so nothing to worry about on the China crackdown."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
a close above 77.50 would be great!
I am surprised with the taget now more than 600... does anyone knows why?
"This is a no-brainer! I am just glad for all of that media fud and hedgies, it's helped me collect some cheap shares! You have to be thankful!"
"Analyst opinions! 28 buys, 8 out performs, 2 holdsWhich makes this a strong buy! See you at $100 by eoy"
JD.com is up 8.66% to 71.42
"$lkncy luckin coffee shares trading at +50% since Feb 2021 whereas other ADR's that do have decent accounting standards are being hammered by the US and western media. Nothing but fear induced by a moronic bunch of motherless fools. We are being led astray by the cheap media like never before. All chinese stocks will eventually and EASILY rise 50 - 80% whether on the mayor exchanges or on the pink sheets. It doesn't matter, just build your positions, be patient and wait. The rest is a sideshow they entertain you and control your thoughts, judgement and emotions with$Doyu is perhaps the most undervalued stock atm. Don't let this opportunity go to waste.$baba $jd $doyu $huya $iq $yy $momo $qtt $qd $qfin $lx $pdd $bili $nio $lcid $uxin $kxin"
holy jus woke up to hk price up 15% its a miracle. Hope this trend continues
