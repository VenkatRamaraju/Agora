"Sounds like BD is in having a lot of economic issues! If the company was doing so well the stock would split. Offering $1.5 billion in a stock offering tells me they. Can’t even borrow money which is at basically 0%! Again, sounds like they are having economic issues"
Anyone got any intel?

"Was expecting a rebound today, not looking good"
"I had missed the run up in July, so glad to be able to get in now at sub $260 price. Also sold some $250 puts. GLTA"
This stock seems to be able to find higher ground and beat valuation estimates. They will be key in the delivery of vaccine.
Prepare for liftoff
"BDX is cheap at these levels. Holding for the long haul,"
"Can someone tell me why BDX is going down in price, is it because of high operating expenses, in other words why are people selling, lost $15.00 in three days, April 17, 2018"
BDX reached a new All Time High at 241.85
"I sold yesterday 500 shares for over $100,000 this is not going anywhere"
"I'm not an expert on this, but it appears to me that the attractiveness of this BDX antigen test may be that it gives medical professionals a tool that will more quickly filter massive numbers of patients down to the potentially sicker ones and then run other tests accordingly. any comments are appreciated. thank you."
270 today
"Given the technical issues with their Alaris pumps, I'm not very keen on buying on any temporary highs. This is still a good company, so long term they should be fine."
"Pretty big dip today.....however, volume is relatively low and didn't see any really big trades. I would venture that it's primarily retail investors like most of us here who are taking some profits. I am holding on though, at least till it hits 275-280."
"ACRX will take market share away from BDX. NEW DISUVIA sublingual is proving to be cheaper, faster, safer than IV opiods. Investers here need to look at ACRX. Its going to explode!"
Some late afternoon bets bidding this up....guidance will be important....since earnings have not yet returned to q4 2019 levels.
"but their major income is from surgery equipments more than 50% , with the global lockdown all non essential surgeries are postponed, i doubt if the testing kits could help to ease the interest payment on their scary level of debts."
This is absolute official break out
This company makes Covid tests and ventilators. Why is it down?
this stock not done much in the past year . good solid company hence long on bdx
Longs in BDX taking a beating. This stable old healthcare company's stock is off big today.
This stock is forming a very long base here lol
Where is the bottom? I think this whole issue on the virus is completely over blown. I would appreciate it if the BD management team would explain the thirty dollars drop that all the legal teams are pushing. It would help those of us who are not completely tuned in each day. I know a lot of corporate insiders were selling at a pretty high price so they go out at the perfect time.
Very nice price point off of an over reaction sell off. I may just take a position. 100 long.
And dividend declared !
This should be a breakout quarter we will get a full look at the following year and a better understanding of the spin-off as well I would buy a head of the August numbers I think we're due for a breakout of a 5-year base 290 300 coming
"If their Coronavirus virus test for present and past virus is real and can be mass market produced quickly, it will be a game changer."

"Who sold 100 shares for 229 AH? I would have paid 230. Anyway, there's no news, just the occasional wackiness in low volume AH trading. It won't be opening tomorrow under 230, or 240, for that matter."
Earnings should show double digits growth easy. Next qtr will be the real winner so load up here before 275 break out. With 6 new products reflecting in q2 and q3 we finally have a catalyst for a much higher stock price. Please don't forget we should all be getting some of the diabetes spin off this year as well. Could not be more bullish for 2nd half of the year numbers. Once we get to 2022 we should trading somewhere between 325 to 350 putting in multiple quarters of substantial growth. For this who are holding and have been getting impatient. It's all going to be worth it next 12 months.
Just buy and hold good companies like this for DECADES and reinvest the dividends.
only the big dogs have this stock!
Just a heads up. This stock will be a key player in the distribution of the vaccine. Syringes order left and right. Poised to surge a little bit...
Earnings should be fabulous
#$%$ is it this co cannot do ANYTHING to please the market?Every earnings I hear they BEAT but go down anyway>Can somebody sell me a vowel???
Can't find news. Why the sell off?
"Covid delta variant cases not accompanied by increased hospitalizations/deaths, so that's not it (effect on non-Covid revenue)...I will continue to hold."
hey anyone know how the spin off of the diabetes business is going to work?
"I could definitely see this shoot up, due to the demand of needles that the world going to need to administer this vaccine. Hopefully we can see some deals be struck in the coming weeks! $300c 6/21"
The dog is barking. Sell.
So this is a good buying opportunity? Anyone bought?
"I see 10% up between now and 2/4/20 ER, which I expect to beat and guide higher. Could run up before report. 275 easy. 300 not unreasonable. patience."
What a cheap miserly dividend increase.
BDX a steal at current price. Vaccines starting to surface. Needles are needed to administer. BDX manuf.’s them!
Bought January $270 calls for 4.5 this morning
"Sold 20--BDX--227.5 puts expiring friday 9/18 @ 1.10 That will be the easiest $2200 I'll make this week. So guys, keep it above 227.5"
Someone must know something today. BDX up strong today?
"Nice to see BDX close at the high (or very near) for the day today – for the last few weeks, day traders would sell during the last hour or so of trading and the day’s high would not hold – well it did today! Also, nice runup from the $220’s about 10 days ago to $238 today. Let’s maintain the momentum!"
I buy this and add in all dips. All testing stocks so bullish
"Why does BDX not acquire or ""lease"" newer syringe technology from Retractable Technologies (RVP)? What is the litigation history between these two syringe producers? For half the $1.2B BDX is investing in their worldwide production, they could take out RVP. What am I missing?"
256+ today
"Excellent earnings report! Not only beat the estimates for the quarter, but very refreshing future outlook. Expecting a lot of analysts raise their 1 year target price to ~$300."
"the stock has gone down $40 from its high, why explain someone that has the stock and is selling"
The chart says to buy again at $219.00 there is a lot of downside on the stock to go. I’m bullish long-term
Good buy opportunity here. Opening positions
"Nothing wrong with the business. Covid has forced cancellation of elective procedures and many have delayed procedures, resulting in a drop in demand. As more becomes known of transmission people will become more comfortable and demand will improve. This is a great core holding."
Management is driving this stock down. They have medically critical products with no Board of Director control or management oversight
you can buy 8 times a share with xom and it always provides nice dividend. xom is still low. glad I moved over to xom and away from BDX.
"Sold 8-BDX-220 for 1.35 puts expiring this friday, 9/25...800 shares X $1.35 = $1080. At least I'm picking up a couple thousand weekly insuring the out of the money strike while I watch my shares lay there like a dead mackeral. This has an easy write on these pullbacks. And with the VIX juiced, the premiums are very nice. G.L. longs"

BDX is down over 10% YTD. It has become a loser over even longer terms. I sold half a month ago and now I am selling the rest. Down today in an up strong market. No apparent reason.
"Fired engineer claims BD sparked CareFusion recalls before acquisitionOctober 1, 2019 By Nancy Crotti Leave a Comment￼The BD R&D engineer whom federal prosecutors have accused of stealing trade secrets claims the company is trying to silence him about its own alleged legal and regulatory violations.Minh Quang Hoang worked at BD’s Sandy, Utah, facility from 1988 until he was fired in August 2015. A superceding indictment charges Hoang with 11 counts of stealing trade secrets related to BD alcohol swab packaging, specifications for foam used to protect BD needleless connector caps, specs and usage information for an unnamed polymer, plans for antimicrobial dressings, market research for device disinfection, and more.In a motion to dismiss filed yesterday, Hoang contends that a new supervisor from CareFusion, which BD acquired for $12.2 billion in 2015, retaliated against Hoang for his allegedly BD-sanctioned pre-merger work digging up regulatory violations on CareFusion products. Those violations prompted “large-scale recalls on CareFusion products causing CareFusion revenues to drop substantially,” the motion says.Hoang maintains that a criminal conviction would benefit BD and discredit any revelations about the company. BD attorneys went so far as to draft proposed indictments, proposed complaints, and proposed search warrants for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 2016, after prosecutors dismissed a previous trade secrets case against Hoang, the motion says. Several portions of the motion pertaining to Hoang’s work for BD are redacted.A BD spokesman said the company would not comment on the federal government’s case “other than to say the statements made by the criminal defendant pertaining to BD are completely without merit.”Hoang claims that he was only backing up the BD information the government is accusing him of stealing."
"Exactly, what happen again for the sudden tank with good news!"
"Did the dividend have anything to do with the value of the stock going down, or why is it going down, Jim OB"
"Why is it going down? I assumed with vaccines in full production, it would be on a steady incline"
my worst investment . I thought this would be a good investment in a solid company
"Start up of economy, BDX will not only sell a lot of covid tests but even more medical supplies in general--a recovery will greatly help them which is not yet priced in. This should be up with the market but sellers selling to buy cruise and airlines--a mistake as these industries will not recover as quickly as BDX."
"So the Company announces a dividend increase, and the stock price goes down further. Go figure."
Some price action here. Any thoughts?
"Morgan Stanley raised the target price to $285 (from $248) just a couple of weeks ago, and then lowers it today to $270 – so much for confidence in their own analysis! They don’t know any more than you and I it seems. And Abbott gets approval for its 15 minute $5 Covid test today also, so some investors who were betting on revenue from the BD tests must have decided to jump ship today. We can see the same for Quidel as well (although a little more drastic there!) Decent recovery from the day’s low for both stocks – which is nice. BD did hit a great buy point below $235 today!!!!!!! You should be pretty safe buying at price – specially if you can hold for 6 months. Good luck to all longs!"
will this be hurt now Amazon will be in distribution medicines?thanks in advance.
Lets see if the hedge funds dont take it up 10 today. We could easliy see 240 by end of the month. I was lucky and have taken advantage of 3 bounces from sub 220 to 224 have been rewarded like clockwork. All the best to BDX and shareholders
Govt support with funding is great
Perhaps the numbers used to make the Bard acquisition were either misrepresented (or flawed) or misinterpreted; that can happen when the emotions are used to make the deal happen. I haven't reviewed information surrounding the acquisition. Need to read the last earnings report for some clues.
I agree here as well. low open marking good buying opp imo
extremely overvalued
So Barclay's increased the price target to $300. Other analysts will soon follow suit.
Sold--10--220--puts expiring 10/2--@1.10 picking up $1100 while I wait for my shares to increase in value. Far easier to make money trading options on BDX that owning the shares.....
$BDX will have their divestment of Vyaire complete by the end of the month and gee I wonder where they could spend the $435MM... Anyone say $AKER??
This stock needs to split to attract more millennial investors.
"Good earnings report, trading below lower Bollinger band, going ex dividend in less than a month.I kind of want to go all-in tomorrow morning."
No reason for \BD stock to go down this much when Revenue and expenses are favorable and debt is manageable Jamie
MD just bought 250k test kit worth 7.5m Virginia to follow.
Loaded up at $246 thank you universe....
BDX just got gov't contract to produce covid-19 testing kits
"RVP is a better stock, right time to buy now before it goes up next month."
Down $8+ on earnings report. Wow!! Buying opportunity?
Why the sell off? I can't find out anything that would cause it to this degree.
Has this stock finally woke up?
Guys have absolute no worries about the delayed reaction on the open. This just gave us a chance to clean up 253 adding 259 adding. 110 HOLDING for 330 350.
"Rocket launch - this is going higher, much higher - good to go, Houston"
"What a stock! More good news, and the price gets lowered... Geez"
"The Covid 19 windfall for BD is yet to come.......they very recently got approval for their 15 minute test, so positive impact from that will only come from current quarter and next, maybe for a couple of quarters. The other big windfall is going come from the sale of delivery devices (i.e. syringes and accessories), and that will happen WHEN there is a vaccine to be delivered. Company's legacy business is down due to covid. Hence the disappointing outlook for this FY. I didn't realize that the legacy business was impacted negatively by the magnitude the company reported. I was certainly wrong and unfortunately got hurt by the ~$25 decline on the day of earnings release. At this point, now that I am wiser, I don't think this stock is going to move much higher in the short term. With a $10/share earnings outlook for this FY, I can't rationalize a stock price of >$250 at his point. Unless of course BD does a really good acquisition!!!! Who knows, maybe it is coming soon.However, having said all that, I still think this is a very good company and certainly investment grade if you have a long term horizon. I would buy again if the stock goes down to the $230 level."
healthcare getting nailed. BDX moves higher. would expect move lower from 255
seems as though everytime the market is BDX is down... and vice versa...???
Sold 10--BDX--220 puts expiring 9/18 @ .65 thanks for buying the insurance from me.....+$650
Why such a drop in price when BD exceeds financial targets?
BDX will report a surprise earnings...
"If they split the stock small investors who are buy and hold would not sell and that would, put a floor under the stock."
"hold from buying this, BDX might go down the 220."
Selling all today. BDX's projections and market conditions look poor for the foreseeable future.
Skyharbour Resources Ltd. ( $SYH.V $SYHBF) is trading at just $0.69 despite announcing some great news last week. $SYH has entered into an option agreement with Black Shield Metals Corp. ( $BDX.C ) which provides Black Shield an earn-in option to acquire up to a 75% interest in the Mann Lake Uranium Project. Under this agreement Black Shield will contribute $4.8M over a three-year period to advance the Mann Lake project The Mann Lake Uranium Project located in the eastern Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. It is located just 25 km southwest of the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world.I think that the deal with $BDX.C is a good move for $SYH as the money that they will get to advance the project hopefully to uranium production.https://skyharbourltd.com/news-media/news/news-display/skyharbour-signs-option-agreement-with-black-shield-metals-corp-to-option-75-of-the-mann-lake-uranium-project
"As the stock is tanking there must be some news, but I can't find it. What's up? or should I say down?"
Why dropping? It should be up as it beats estimates and better performance compared to same quarter in prior year.
BDX is down 5.05% to 222.87
What happened? Looks like they met expectations for the quarter.
"Mystery stock....makes all kinds of products, earnings, Covid and non Covid recovery potential, pays dividend, and goes down. I see $260 this month. $300 next."
I am hoping that next week when they report the yearly numbers they will have positive reports in all areas and I think they will. It is time for the C.R. Bard acquisition to show some positive results.
I have a significant position in BDX since 2010. Until this year it was always a slow and steady gainer. Can someone tell me why it is not doing well? Down again today when the market is soaring.
"Did I miss the buy point already? I think this will go to 275-280, but hesitating to pull the trigger now."
"buy the dip! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst David Lewis maintained a Hold rating on Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) And Company on Thursday, setting a price target of $270, which is approximately 6.31% above the present share price of $253.98.Lewis expects Becton Dickinson And Company to post earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98 for the third quarter of 2020."
Jeez I guess they gave us a chance to buy more!
Share price will crash this morning on their false positive news announced by FDA. Not good at all. Get out and into a winner like $SONA Sona Nanotech.
What is going on with BDX? Debt seems high and they just bought another company?
"It is approved in Holland. They bought a lot of tests, so will all countries in EU."
5 days ago I called 260 by Friday
"I seriously think BD should stop being a Covid testing business. So far, they have been having a lot of challenges in that department. Besides, there are plenty of companies out there who have better tests. Although Covid tests are a very small portion of BD’s revenue (and profitability), any bad news regarding its Covid tests results in a tenfold negative impact on its shares. I think BD should just focus on its legacy business/products, and any Covid windfall (and its only temporary anyway!) will come from its vaccine delivery products. Stock price down $8/9 because some of its tests are having false readings? Well, even if BD loses all its revenue from the testing equipment, the bottom line will not change much. As for its other legacy business, we know it will come back in the next year. So I think this is a really good price point to get in – again, this is not a short term play; if you can hold on to this stock for 6 months and beyond, I am pretty confident it will go back to the $260 - $270 range within a year."
BDX product demand will increase even more as hospitals open up for other non-virus health care items.
FDA warning regarding probable long term mortality caution on Bards coated balloons.
this is another buying opportunity. With the pandemic there first quarter earnings will be great. UBS 275 and others to 300.
This stock should be trading back above 260 270 based on earnings and the spinoff should be worth somewhere between 35 to 50. I will be a buyer all day at these levels. Keep selling boys
this is going surge in the next 2 months. very stable stock and poised for growth with vaccine rollout... buy.
selling this before going lower
"Tom Pollen has a lot of work to do! He needs to drain the BD Swamp of the high level do nothing BS you to death management. And there are a lot of them in BD. Cash cow business units aren't producing what they should be! Are technological core competencies an issue as well? I have heard R&D is more about how, than what you are contributing to the business. If true-Such a philosophy sounds like a losing proposition for the company and shareholders. Let's see what Tom does!"

BDX: Great company at great price!
BDX announced that it is filing an offering of $1.5 Billion worth of common stock. Does anybody know at what amount will this stock be offered or when that announcement will be made? The stock is down over 5% the day after the announcement.
Please buy company Great Basin Scientific (GBSNQ)
Exclusive distributor of that BD COVID test is HSIC. cheaper stock!
Must have been something on the Earnings Call as the Q4 results look pretty good.
"What a great acquisition for BDX, they will make AKER a profitable company !"
buffett may like this one
Is this really all Bernie madness?
Is BD being used as a day trader punching bag or what?? Stock should not be up $3 one day and down $3 the next. This company performs!
Appears to be a little oversold. Hold and watch for some rebound. Preparing to sell given the probably downward forces at work over the foreseeable future.
how do you think the $bdx FDA approval will affect us?

Where is this going? It seems the smart money made it and moved on. The quarter was great and same for the guidance.
BD beats earnings estimates yet stock down $9+ a share today. Why?
Will the price bounce back to $250 today?There been no bad news to be found.
"with favorable revenue and favorable expenses and favorfable debet, looks like to me everything is okay, why is members or the Board of Directors ast BDX selling their stock, this is what is making the price go down, looks like they know something we dont know, insider trading"

I haven’t sold one share. Long all testing stocks. Earnings have been great thus far. TMO great today ...
Does anyone know if current shareholders will get any part of the new diabetes company (NewCo) that BDX plans to spinoff next year?
I have held this stock for quite a while. It’s has not appreciated much since I added it to my portfolio. But I know from past history whenever I sell the stick goes up. Also whenever I buy the stock goes down.
"I like this stock. It has been good to me, but I did sell it because it was in the profit zone and I began to feel uncomfortable that daily cases have been coming down. I think cases are down because many people who should be getting tested are deciding not to, due to the turnaround time to get results is too long. I know there are other reasons to get medical tests using BDX equipment, making it a good long term investment, but shor term I think it's overbought based on the investor frenzy with testing stocks. I re-allocated the money into two names that proved to do very well in the pre covid market and crushed in the post covid market."
sold 10--222.5 puts @ 1.10 expiring next wk...thanks for the $1100 BDX will be higher a wk from today.
Biggest manufacturer of Syringes in the world. Easy play
More good news lets see if this does the trick I think so. Breakout is close.
sold--6--BDX--235 puts here @ 1.90 Thanks for the $1140.. .at least I'm making a few bucks while I wait til BDX awakens....
Stock has done nothing in 3 years
Very frustrating stock to watch. Good runups now and then but lots of volatility and never able to hold gains for long. Good company with great future potential but too many investors play with this stock.
Going to buy some at 220 tomorrow.
BDXA reached a new All Time High at 62.98
Good opportunity to pick up a few more shares!
"Just wanted to make sure... y'all understand BDX makes majority of the syringes in the U.S. and supply most of the vaccine (100' of millions) injection purposes, right? Did y'all also realize that the cost of syringe has been climibing up rapidly since early 2020? The latest quarter earning will EXPLODE. Let's hold and all be +20%+++++ on the next earning report."
what are your feelings on the upcoming Financial quarter for bdx?
$219.00 new price target buying opportunity
"What’s causing this drop, given big beats on eps and revenue?"
259 was the technical break out buy point. Finally it's happening. 3 failed attempts we should hit 279 soon
No closing date for Bard acquisition!!???

No more in and out of stocks for me. I am sticking with one for the rest of my life.
"Abbott?s ID NOW COVID-19 test is a vital weapon in this battle. It is a fast, molecular point-of-care test, one that can deliver results in as little #$%$ minutes and cost $5.00.That's a real game changer. BDX has certainly got to get its core businesses going and not hope Covid-19 solutions to drive Rev."
Only portfolio holding with a gain today. May I have another?
Anyone here any thing on earnings whispers. Should be blow out qtr. Like last time. We were right here 259 after earnings should have broke out. Maybe this time it will release 275 285
BDX reached a new All Time High at 239.24
RED? What am I missing?
"Last insider sales I see were in early sept and moderate, though at the top of the chart....today busted cleanly through and past the 245 shelf.....next support is around the $232-$237 area going bach to May-June....unless this retraces to $245 quickly I think we'll see the $232 area shortly.....longer term, no worries...."
"Wowowow. Guidance was the real deal. no more being range bound, will break out. The hedgies have been like clock work in and out 220 to 250. Was easy for them. A close over 270 and some upgrades I think we could easily see 320 to 350 this year. And we getting a nice little Divy. Cant beat it. This stock not going to get pounded down anymore. The wearable injectable they own the space. Next two years of syringes being in short supply. Its almost to easy. Diabetic market to expand 20% to 30% next 5 years."
Bullish
earnings was a home run----
Good buying opportunity today down $9
"Need needles to administer covid vaccines, BDX manufactures them!"
Adding some today. Clear by the chart its near the bottom here because we are not in a recession and stocks overshot to the downside. Great long term buy and hold. Should be one of your top holdings for next 10+ years.
