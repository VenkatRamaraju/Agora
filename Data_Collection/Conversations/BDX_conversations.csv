BDX a steal at current price. Vaccines starting to surface. Needles are needed to administer. BDX manuf.’s them!
"Just wanted to make sure... y'all understand BDX makes majority of the syringes in the U.S. and supply most of the vaccine (100' of millions) injection purposes, right? Did y'all also realize that the cost of syringe has been climibing up rapidly since early 2020? The latest quarter earning will EXPLODE. Let's hold and all be +20%+++++ on the next earning report."
BDX down almost 10% in one day! Long time holder surprised by the poor projections.
Anyone have any idea how exposed BDX is to China business. BSX has already announced lowered guidance because of the corona virus. Their take is that Chinese citizens are putting elective surgeries off until the virus abates.Long shares and synthetically long with OTM puts.
Everybody! Out of the car and push!!
"Good earnings report, trading below lower Bollinger band, going ex dividend in less than a month.I kind of want to go all-in tomorrow morning."
Adding some today. Clear by the chart its near the bottom here because we are not in a recession and stocks overshot to the downside. Great long term buy and hold. Should be one of your top holdings for next 10+ years.
Only portfolio holding with a gain today. May I have another?
"I could definitely see this shoot up, due to the demand of needles that the world going to need to administer this vaccine. Hopefully we can see some deals be struck in the coming weeks! $300c 6/21"
This stock is forming a very long base here lol
"Why the share off reached $249 and then ended up $242, why?"
Just a heads up. This stock will be a key player in the distribution of the vaccine. Syringes order left and right. Poised to surge a little bit...
this stock not done much in the past year . good solid company hence long on bdx
will continue to 275
BDX product demand will increase even more as hospitals open up for other non-virus health care items.
how do you think the $bdx FDA approval will affect us?
you can buy 8 times a share with xom and it always provides nice dividend. xom is still low. glad I moved over to xom and away from BDX.
"Still holding large position...expect even better price #$%$ rotates out of green, small caps, to better plays and leaders, health care suppliers like this one. 275+ or bust I say!"
Some late afternoon bets bidding this up....guidance will be important....since earnings have not yet returned to q4 2019 levels.
This stock needs to split to attract more millennial investors.
who is going to be picking up more shares of BDX soon?
Wow! Why the sell off? I have not seen any reason for this at least not yet.
"If they split the stock small investors who are buy and hold would not sell and that would, put a floor under the stock."
These guys better have a blow out earnings release tomorrow. Need something to get this trending up
Good buy opportunity here. Opening positions

Nice little one day pop. Coming off a significant support line.
"Why is it going down? I assumed with vaccines in full production, it would be on a steady incline"
Whats happening here ?!?
"Nothing wrong with the business. Covid has forced cancellation of elective procedures and many have delayed procedures, resulting in a drop in demand. As more becomes known of transmission people will become more comfortable and demand will improve. This is a great core holding."
interview with BDX CEO coming up on CNBC
So Barclay's increased the price target to $300. Other analysts will soon follow suit.
Why dropping? It should be up as it beats estimates and better performance compared to same quarter in prior year.

I thought I heard today they are coming out with an ap or something that you can test for covid with your smart phone. Does that have something to do with beckon or was it another stock. Tia for info.

Earnings should show double digits growth easy. Next qtr will be the real winner so load up here before 275 break out. With 6 new products reflecting in q2 and q3 we finally have a catalyst for a much higher stock price. Please don't forget we should all be getting some of the diabetes spin off this year as well. Could not be more bullish for 2nd half of the year numbers. Once we get to 2022 we should trading somewhere between 325 to 350 putting in multiple quarters of substantial growth. For this who are holding and have been getting impatient. It's all going to be worth it next 12 months.

BDX at $250 5/20/2020 WTH !
This is absolute official break out
us retail investors are always the last to know
This stock should be trading back above 260 270 based on earnings and the spinoff should be worth somewhere between 35 to 50. I will be a buyer all day at these levels. Keep selling boys
No reason for \BD stock to go down this much when Revenue and expenses are favorable and debt is manageable Jamie
Syringe shortage. Good buy.
"Looking at the 52 week range, I think it has done pretty well!"
"Mystery stock....makes all kinds of products, earnings, Covid and non Covid recovery potential, pays dividend, and goes down. I see $260 this month. $300 next."
"BDX is cheap at these levels. Holding for the long haul,"
Does anyone have a clear understanding of how BDXA the 6.125% preferred mandatory convertible 5/20 will convert? The divy is the same as the common. Is it better to just hold the preferred and take the divy and not convert or convert?
The chart says to buy again at $219.00 there is a lot of downside on the stock to go. I’m bullish long-term
"I'm not an expert on this, but it appears to me that the attractiveness of this BDX antigen test may be that it gives medical professionals a tool that will more quickly filter massive numbers of patients down to the potentially sicker ones and then run other tests accordingly. any comments are appreciated. thank you."
earnings was a home run----
Guys have absolute no worries about the delayed reaction on the open. This just gave us a chance to clean up 253 adding 259 adding. 110 HOLDING for 330 350.

Lets see if the hedge funds dont take it up 10 today. We could easliy see 240 by end of the month. I was lucky and have taken advantage of 3 bounces from sub 220 to 224 have been rewarded like clockwork. All the best to BDX and shareholders
Does anyone know if current shareholders will get any part of the new diabetes company (NewCo) that BDX plans to spinoff next year?
"I sold yesterday 500 shares for over $100,000 this is not going anywhere"
BDX is down over 10% YTD. It has become a loser over even longer terms. I sold half a month ago and now I am selling the rest. Down today in an up strong market. No apparent reason.
Longs in BDX taking a beating. This stable old healthcare company's stock is off big today.
Prepare for liftoff

259 was the technical break out buy point. Finally it's happening. 3 failed attempts we should hit 279 soon
"So the Company announces a dividend increase, and the stock price goes down further. Go figure."
Alas! Don't have any more funds to add more BDX at these prices!
Not sure why its down. But Ricardo seems to have a good handle on this one. EX news is a blip.
Appears to be a little oversold. Hold and watch for some rebound. Preparing to sell given the probably downward forces at work over the foreseeable future.

"Fired engineer claims BD sparked CareFusion recalls before acquisitionOctober 1, 2019 By Nancy Crotti Leave a Comment￼The BD R&D engineer whom federal prosecutors have accused of stealing trade secrets claims the company is trying to silence him about its own alleged legal and regulatory violations.Minh Quang Hoang worked at BD’s Sandy, Utah, facility from 1988 until he was fired in August 2015. A superceding indictment charges Hoang with 11 counts of stealing trade secrets related to BD alcohol swab packaging, specifications for foam used to protect BD needleless connector caps, specs and usage information for an unnamed polymer, plans for antimicrobial dressings, market research for device disinfection, and more.In a motion to dismiss filed yesterday, Hoang contends that a new supervisor from CareFusion, which BD acquired for $12.2 billion in 2015, retaliated against Hoang for his allegedly BD-sanctioned pre-merger work digging up regulatory violations on CareFusion products. Those violations prompted “large-scale recalls on CareFusion products causing CareFusion revenues to drop substantially,” the motion says.Hoang maintains that a criminal conviction would benefit BD and discredit any revelations about the company. BD attorneys went so far as to draft proposed indictments, proposed complaints, and proposed search warrants for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 2016, after prosecutors dismissed a previous trade secrets case against Hoang, the motion says. Several portions of the motion pertaining to Hoang’s work for BD are redacted.A BD spokesman said the company would not comment on the federal government’s case “other than to say the statements made by the criminal defendant pertaining to BD are completely without merit.”Hoang claims that he was only backing up the BD information the government is accusing him of stealing."
Now is the time to buy!
I am hoping that next week when they report the yearly numbers they will have positive reports in all areas and I think they will. It is time for the C.R. Bard acquisition to show some positive results.
What a cheap miserly dividend increase.
Here we go
I have a significant position in BDX since 2010. Until this year it was always a slow and steady gainer. Can someone tell me why it is not doing well? Down again today when the market is soaring.
BDX will report a surprise earnings...
Coranvirus. Causes people to end up in respirators. BDX is a big manufacturer of them. Harvard epidemologist says 70% of world will get Corona. Seems like a growth stock to me!
Glad to see the bleeding has finally stopped! Hope this gets back to a reasonable valuation around $260 soon.
Down $8+ on earnings report. Wow!! Buying opportunity?
Where is this going? It seems the smart money made it and moved on. The quarter was great and same for the guidance.
Sold 10--BDX--220 puts expiring 9/18 @ .65 thanks for buying the insurance from me.....+$650
What happened? Looks like they met expectations for the quarter.
Good opportunity to pick up a few more shares!
"Ok, I'm in. Hopefully not a big mistake..."
Guidance for 2020 $12.50-12.65 lower than expected
"Sounds like BD is in having a lot of economic issues! If the company was doing so well the stock would split. Offering $1.5 billion in a stock offering tells me they. Can’t even borrow money which is at basically 0%! Again, sounds like they are having economic issues"
Buying Opportunity ! Don't miss it..
I buy this and add in all dips. All testing stocks so bullish
what are your feelings on the upcoming Financial quarter for bdx?
Will the price bounce back to $250 today?There been no bad news to be found.
"Tom Pollen has a lot of work to do! He needs to drain the BD Swamp of the high level do nothing BS you to death management. And there are a lot of them in BD. Cash cow business units aren't producing what they should be! Are technological core competencies an issue as well? I have heard R&D is more about how, than what you are contributing to the business. If true-Such a philosophy sounds like a losing proposition for the company and shareholders. Let's see what Tom does!"
"I seriously think BD should stop being a Covid testing business. So far, they have been having a lot of challenges in that department. Besides, there are plenty of companies out there who have better tests. Although Covid tests are a very small portion of BD’s revenue (and profitability), any bad news regarding its Covid tests results in a tenfold negative impact on its shares. I think BD should just focus on its legacy business/products, and any Covid windfall (and its only temporary anyway!) will come from its vaccine delivery products. Stock price down $8/9 because some of its tests are having false readings? Well, even if BD loses all its revenue from the testing equipment, the bottom line will not change much. As for its other legacy business, we know it will come back in the next year. So I think this is a really good price point to get in – again, this is not a short term play; if you can hold on to this stock for 6 months and beyond, I am pretty confident it will go back to the $260 - $270 range within a year."
"Sold 8-BDX-220 for 1.35 puts expiring this friday, 9/25...800 shares X $1.35 = $1080. At least I'm picking up a couple thousand weekly insuring the out of the money strike while I watch my shares lay there like a dead mackeral. This has an easy write on these pullbacks. And with the VIX juiced, the premiums are very nice. G.L. longs"
Just buy and hold good companies like this for DECADES and reinvest the dividends.
"Covid delta variant cases not accompanied by increased hospitalizations/deaths, so that's not it (effect on non-Covid revenue)...I will continue to hold."
This should be a breakout quarter we will get a full look at the following year and a better understanding of the spin-off as well I would buy a head of the August numbers I think we're due for a breakout of a 5-year base 290 300 coming
buy buy buy
$BDX will have their divestment of Vyaire complete by the end of the month and gee I wonder where they could spend the $435MM... Anyone say $AKER??
"I see 10% up between now and 2/4/20 ER, which I expect to beat and guide higher. Could run up before report. 275 easy. 300 not unreasonable. patience."
"Pretty big dip today.....however, volume is relatively low and didn't see any really big trades. I would venture that it's primarily retail investors like most of us here who are taking some profits. I am holding on though, at least till it hits 275-280."
Perhaps the numbers used to make the Bard acquisition were either misrepresented (or flawed) or misinterpreted; that can happen when the emotions are used to make the deal happen. I haven't reviewed information surrounding the acquisition. Need to read the last earnings report for some clues.
Some price action here. Any thoughts?
extremely overvalued
"The Covid 19 windfall for BD is yet to come.......they very recently got approval for their 15 minute test, so positive impact from that will only come from current quarter and next, maybe for a couple of quarters. The other big windfall is going come from the sale of delivery devices (i.e. syringes and accessories), and that will happen WHEN there is a vaccine to be delivered. Company's legacy business is down due to covid. Hence the disappointing outlook for this FY. I didn't realize that the legacy business was impacted negatively by the magnitude the company reported. I was certainly wrong and unfortunately got hurt by the ~$25 decline on the day of earnings release. At this point, now that I am wiser, I don't think this stock is going to move much higher in the short term. With a $10/share earnings outlook for this FY, I can't rationalize a stock price of >$250 at his point. Unless of course BD does a really good acquisition!!!! Who knows, maybe it is coming soon.However, having said all that, I still think this is a very good company and certainly investment grade if you have a long term horizon. I would buy again if the stock goes down to the $230 level."
This has been a dog investment in my portfolio. Hoping to see price appreciate
BDX: Great company at great price!
Google his nameRonald Read
"""Easy Money"" stock as it rolls higher. I always buy those dips into earnings and wait for the move higher as the big boys continue to load up! Will get a nice pop on blow out earnings!"
BDX is down 5.05% to 222.87
Loaded up
So this is a good buying opportunity? Anyone bought?
buffet would buy these guys at $175 in a crash
"I like this stock. It has been good to me, but I did sell it because it was in the profit zone and I began to feel uncomfortable that daily cases have been coming down. I think cases are down because many people who should be getting tested are deciding not to, due to the turnaround time to get results is too long. I know there are other reasons to get medical tests using BDX equipment, making it a good long term investment, but shor term I think it's overbought based on the investor frenzy with testing stocks. I re-allocated the money into two names that proved to do very well in the pre covid market and crushed in the post covid market."
"buy the dip! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst David Lewis maintained a Hold rating on Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) And Company on Thursday, setting a price target of $270, which is approximately 6.31% above the present share price of $253.98.Lewis expects Becton Dickinson And Company to post earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98 for the third quarter of 2020."
Someone must know something today. BDX up strong today?
Anyone with any knowledge about why the big drop today?
"Nice to see BDX close at the high (or very near) for the day today – for the last few weeks, day traders would sell during the last hour or so of trading and the day’s high would not hold – well it did today! Also, nice runup from the $220’s about 10 days ago to $238 today. Let’s maintain the momentum!"
"What’s causing this drop, given big beats on eps and revenue?"
BDXA reached a 52 Week high at 67.35
Is this really all Bernie madness?
Sold--10--220--puts expiring 10/2--@1.10 picking up $1100 while I wait for my shares to increase in value. Far easier to make money trading options on BDX that owning the shares.....
Why such a drop in price when BD exceeds financial targets?
Management is driving this stock down. They have medically critical products with no Board of Director control or management oversight
Where is the bottom? I think this whole issue on the virus is completely over blown. I would appreciate it if the BD management team would explain the thirty dollars drop that all the legal teams are pushing. It would help those of us who are not completely tuned in each day. I know a lot of corporate insiders were selling at a pretty high price so they go out at the perfect time.
Selling all today. BDX's projections and market conditions look poor for the foreseeable future.
$219.00 new price target buying opportunity
Earnings should be fabulous
BDXA reached a new All Time High at 62.98
Share price will crash this morning on their false positive news announced by FDA. Not good at all. Get out and into a winner like $SONA Sona Nanotech.
"This rocket is launched with EU approval for COVID-19 tests now - expect monster moves starting tomorrow as the shorts are crushed - Houston, good to go now."
Anyone here any thing on earnings whispers. Should be blow out qtr. Like last time. We were right here 259 after earnings should have broke out. Maybe this time it will release 275 285
5 days ago I called 260 by Friday
This stock seems to be able to find higher ground and beat valuation estimates. They will be key in the delivery of vaccine.
Why the sell off? I can't find out anything that would cause it to this degree.
my worst investment . I thought this would be a good investment in a solid company
"but their major income is from surgery equipments more than 50% , with the global lockdown all non essential surgeries are postponed, i doubt if the testing kits could help to ease the interest payment on their scary level of debts."
Exclusive distributor of that BD COVID test is HSIC. cheaper stock!
No more in and out of stocks for me. I am sticking with one for the rest of my life.
"Start up of economy, BDX will not only sell a lot of covid tests but even more medical supplies in general--a recovery will greatly help them which is not yet priced in. This should be up with the market but sellers selling to buy cruise and airlines--a mistake as these industries will not recover as quickly as BDX."
Who manufactures the Covid test kits?
"Wowowow. Guidance was the real deal. no more being range bound, will break out. The hedgies have been like clock work in and out 220 to 250. Was easy for them. A close over 270 and some upgrades I think we could easily see 320 to 350 this year. And we getting a nice little Divy. Cant beat it. This stock not going to get pounded down anymore. The wearable injectable they own the space. Next two years of syringes being in short supply. Its almost to easy. Diabetic market to expand 20% to 30% next 5 years."
Conversion date of BDXA to BDX shares can occur on 5/1/2020
"It is approved in Holland. They bought a lot of tests, so will all countries in EU."
I have held this stock for quite a while. It’s has not appreciated much since I added it to my portfolio. But I know from past history whenever I sell the stick goes up. Also whenever I buy the stock goes down.
fda just issue a warning letter ...not good news...have until feb 1 to reply
I did not the earnings report but it appears wall street was not happy so beat BDX down
Anyone got any intel?
Musk is a very smart man so he took the B D test four times. you might as wells flip a coin. cause. the 5th coin flip is the non answer. Verdict B D must be selling aah flim flam to a very high profile person..
Leerink upgrade to 277 price target
"Was expecting a rebound today, not looking good"
"Why does BDX not acquire or ""lease"" newer syringe technology from Retractable Technologies (RVP)? What is the litigation history between these two syringe producers? For half the $1.2B BDX is investing in their worldwide production, they could take out RVP. What am I missing?"
BDX should consider buying or merging with either Quest Diagnostics or Labcorp.
"Morgan Stanley raised the target price to $285 (from $248) just a couple of weeks ago, and then lowers it today to $270 – so much for confidence in their own analysis! They don’t know any more than you and I it seems. And Abbott gets approval for its 15 minute $5 Covid test today also, so some investors who were betting on revenue from the BD tests must have decided to jump ship today. We can see the same for Quidel as well (although a little more drastic there!) Decent recovery from the day’s low for both stocks – which is nice. BD did hit a great buy point below $235 today!!!!!!! You should be pretty safe buying at price – specially if you can hold for 6 months. Good luck to all longs!"
"Did I miss the buy point already? I think this will go to 275-280, but hesitating to pull the trigger now."
only the big dogs have this stock!
this is going surge in the next 2 months. very stable stock and poised for growth with vaccine rollout... buy.
"Sold 20--BDX--227.5 puts expiring friday 9/18 @ 1.10 That will be the easiest $2200 I'll make this week. So guys, keep it above 227.5"
Has this stock finally woke up?
Going to buy some at 220 tomorrow.
Do we think we will see a dip again tomorrow since the news break of some of the test they manufacture are producing false positives?
sold--6--BDX--235 puts here @ 1.90 Thanks for the $1140.. .at least I'm making a few bucks while I wait til BDX awakens....
healthcare getting nailed. BDX moves higher. would expect move lower from 255
I haven’t sold one share. Long all testing stocks. Earnings have been great thus far. TMO great today ...
BDX announced that it is filing an offering of $1.5 Billion worth of common stock. Does anybody know at what amount will this stock be offered or when that announcement will be made? The stock is down over 5% the day after the announcement.
this is another buying opportunity. With the pandemic there first quarter earnings will be great. UBS 275 and others to 300.
Must have been something on the Earnings Call as the Q4 results look pretty good.
Any weakness in this fantastic company is a buying opportunity.
"Excellent earnings report! Not only beat the estimates for the quarter, but very refreshing future outlook. Expecting a lot of analysts raise their 1 year target price to ~$300."
"ACRX will take market share away from BDX. NEW DISUVIA sublingual is proving to be cheaper, faster, safer than IV opiods. Investers here need to look at ACRX. Its going to explode!"
I agree here as well. low open marking good buying opp imo
"Tell us why your stock is going down, whyt are people selling? Dont udnerstand when revenue ils good, maybe too much debt but can be taken care of job"
256+ today
"Certainly testing its $235 support level today. If it holds, I think it will gap up tomorrow. Keeping fingers crossed!"
BDX suffering even on strong day in the market. Skeptical investors.
Announcement coming
Whose running this company?
RED? What am I missing?
Please buy company Great Basin Scientific (GBSNQ)
"with favorable revenue and favorable expenses and favorfable debet, looks like to me everything is okay, why is members or the Board of Directors ast BDX selling their stock, this is what is making the price go down, looks like they know something we dont know, insider trading"
