This stock needs to split to attract more millennial investors.
"Can someone tell me why BDX is going down in price, is it because of high operating expenses, in other words why are people selling, lost $15.00 in three days, April 17, 2018"
Very frustrating stock to watch. Good runups now and then but lots of volatility and never able to hold gains for long. Good company with great future potential but too many investors play with this stock.
Will the price bounce back to $250 today?There been no bad news to be found.
"If their Coronavirus virus test for present and past virus is real and can be mass market produced quickly, it will be a game changer."
"What a great acquisition for BDX, they will make AKER a profitable company !"
"For those into small-cap mining! The stock formally known as, $BDX, has changed its name to Black Shield Metals and is now trading under the ticker $NCLR on the CSE. Additionally, $NCLR has made an option agreement with $SYH to acquire a 75% earn-in option of their Mann Lake Uranium Project. Mann Lake is located just 25 km southwest of the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world, so this deal is going to be huge for $NCLR! $BDX.C ----> $NCLR.C https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/100743/CSE-Bulletin-Name-and-Symbol-Change-Black-Shield-Metals-Corp.-BDX"
"I'm not an expert on this, but it appears to me that the attractiveness of this BDX antigen test may be that it gives medical professionals a tool that will more quickly filter massive numbers of patients down to the potentially sicker ones and then run other tests accordingly. any comments are appreciated. thank you."
"Good earnings report, trading below lower Bollinger band, going ex dividend in less than a month.I kind of want to go all-in tomorrow morning."
"RVP is a better stock, right time to buy now before it goes up next month."
Does anyone know if current shareholders will get any part of the new diabetes company (NewCo) that BDX plans to spinoff next year?
will this be hurt now Amazon will be in distribution medicines?thanks in advance.
259 was the technical break out buy point. Finally it's happening. 3 failed attempts we should hit 279 soon
"Why does BDX not acquire or ""lease"" newer syringe technology from Retractable Technologies (RVP)? What is the litigation history between these two syringe producers? For half the $1.2B BDX is investing in their worldwide production, they could take out RVP. What am I missing?"
This stock should be trading back above 260 270 based on earnings and the spinoff should be worth somewhere between 35 to 50. I will be a buyer all day at these levels. Keep selling boys
Loaded up at $246 thank you universe....
Stock has done nothing in 3 years
Where is the bottom? I think this whole issue on the virus is completely over blown. I would appreciate it if the BD management team would explain the thirty dollars drop that all the legal teams are pushing. It would help those of us who are not completely tuned in each day. I know a lot of corporate insiders were selling at a pretty high price so they go out at the perfect time.
I haven’t sold one share. Long all testing stocks. Earnings have been great thus far. TMO great today ...
I have a significant position in BDX since 2010. Until this year it was always a slow and steady gainer. Can someone tell me why it is not doing well? Down again today when the market is soaring.
"Sounds like BD is in having a lot of economic issues! If the company was doing so well the stock would split. Offering $1.5 billion in a stock offering tells me they. Can’t even borrow money which is at basically 0%! Again, sounds like they are having economic issues"
"I seriously think BD should stop being a Covid testing business. So far, they have been having a lot of challenges in that department. Besides, there are plenty of companies out there who have better tests. Although Covid tests are a very small portion of BD’s revenue (and profitability), any bad news regarding its Covid tests results in a tenfold negative impact on its shares. I think BD should just focus on its legacy business/products, and any Covid windfall (and its only temporary anyway!) will come from its vaccine delivery products. Stock price down $8/9 because some of its tests are having false readings? Well, even if BD loses all its revenue from the testing equipment, the bottom line will not change much. As for its other legacy business, we know it will come back in the next year. So I think this is a really good price point to get in – again, this is not a short term play; if you can hold on to this stock for 6 months and beyond, I am pretty confident it will go back to the $260 - $270 range within a year."
Skyharbour Resources Ltd. ( $SYH.V $SYHBF) is trading at just $0.69 despite announcing some great news last week. $SYH has entered into an option agreement with Black Shield Metals Corp. ( $BDX.C ) which provides Black Shield an earn-in option to acquire up to a 75% interest in the Mann Lake Uranium Project. Under this agreement Black Shield will contribute $4.8M over a three-year period to advance the Mann Lake project The Mann Lake Uranium Project located in the eastern Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. It is located just 25 km southwest of the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world.I think that the deal with $BDX.C is a good move for $SYH as the money that they will get to advance the project hopefully to uranium production.https://skyharbourltd.com/news-media/news/news-display/skyharbour-signs-option-agreement-with-black-shield-metals-corp-to-option-75-of-the-mann-lake-uranium-project
"What a stock! More good news, and the price gets lowered... Geez"
This is absolute official break out
BDX announced that it is filing an offering of $1.5 Billion worth of common stock. Does anybody know at what amount will this stock be offered or when that announcement will be made? The stock is down over 5% the day after the announcement.
BD beats earnings estimates yet stock down $9+ a share today. Why?
"Wowowow. Guidance was the real deal. no more being range bound, will break out. The hedgies have been like clock work in and out 220 to 250. Was easy for them. A close over 270 and some upgrades I think we could easily see 320 to 350 this year. And we getting a nice little Divy. Cant beat it. This stock not going to get pounded down anymore. The wearable injectable they own the space. Next two years of syringes being in short supply. Its almost to easy. Diabetic market to expand 20% to 30% next 5 years."

"ACRX will take market share away from BDX. NEW DISUVIA sublingual is proving to be cheaper, faster, safer than IV opiods. Investers here need to look at ACRX. Its going to explode!"
BDX product demand will increase even more as hospitals open up for other non-virus health care items.
I have held this stock for quite a while. It’s has not appreciated much since I added it to my portfolio. But I know from past history whenever I sell the stick goes up. Also whenever I buy the stock goes down.
"buy the dip! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst David Lewis maintained a Hold rating on Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) And Company on Thursday, setting a price target of $270, which is approximately 6.31% above the present share price of $253.98.Lewis expects Becton Dickinson And Company to post earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98 for the third quarter of 2020."
"So the Company announces a dividend increase, and the stock price goes down further. Go figure."
"Nothing wrong with the business. Covid has forced cancellation of elective procedures and many have delayed procedures, resulting in a drop in demand. As more becomes known of transmission people will become more comfortable and demand will improve. This is a great core holding."

Earnings should show double digits growth easy. Next qtr will be the real winner so load up here before 275 break out. With 6 new products reflecting in q2 and q3 we finally have a catalyst for a much higher stock price. Please don't forget we should all be getting some of the diabetes spin off this year as well. Could not be more bullish for 2nd half of the year numbers. Once we get to 2022 we should trading somewhere between 325 to 350 putting in multiple quarters of substantial growth. For this who are holding and have been getting impatient. It's all going to be worth it next 12 months.
"Exactly, what happen again for the sudden tank with good news!"
