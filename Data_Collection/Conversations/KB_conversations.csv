I like KB and WF. Both are decent South Korean Stocks.
This is positive with Short Ban removed! Interest rates havenâ€™t caught up with pandemic vaccinations and soon public travel and increased tourism. Free print cash has opened up new highs on Stock Prices and kB moving to capture shareholders!
"EPS last four quarters is $ 9,29 (growing from 2018: $ 6,90 and 2013: $ 3,10).Tangible book value per share in 10 years from $ 50,06 to $ 94,35.So almost 9% increase per year.Price to book: 0,44.And pays also a average dividend of 4% (with potential to go a lot higher)So we have a company that has a history of growing EPS, growing tangible book value per share, paying dividends, with a low price to book and with a PE of 4,8.I think Mr Market has to wake up.This stock price has a lot of room to go a lot higher!?"
