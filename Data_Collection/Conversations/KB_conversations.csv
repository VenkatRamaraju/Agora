"EPS last four quarters is $ 9,29 (growing from 2018: $ 6,90 and 2013: $ 3,10).Tangible book value per share in 10 years from $ 50,06 to $ 94,35.So almost 9% increase per year.Price to book: 0,44.And pays also a average dividend of 4% (with potential to go a lot higher)So we have a company that has a history of growing EPS, growing tangible book value per share, paying dividends, with a low price to book and with a PE of 4,8.I think Mr Market has to wake up.This stock price has a lot of room to go a lot higher!?"
