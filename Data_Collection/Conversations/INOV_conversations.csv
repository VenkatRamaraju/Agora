"INOV is laying off employees at a record rate and moral is destructive, read the former employees review at Glass Door. Company is not going anywhere and has 1,5 Billion in intangibles and goodwill and no profits. This company is a zombie"
Just another broken IPO? How do the hedge funds that followed Ron Baron into this stock get out?

"excellently orchestrated virtual analyst day this week, available for replay on their website. You get introduced to the team, shown actual product demonstrations, and told again about the good opportunity and unique positioning of the company. One way to think about it is they own a toll booth on the HC data highway which is seeing a strong trend of rising traffic. It is still early days."

"Stay out of this stock...This is classic wall street scam by all accounts. It's how the street works...Here are some facts to convince you:1. Float = 151 Million shares. How is that? around 64M in Class A shares and 87M class B shares that are hidden and not tracked until they are converted to class B shares, Check quarterly financial report. It's all there...2. Cash position = 712M (cash)-270M (credit line draw)=442M . If you account for around 112M for acquisition in 4Q then real cash position = 330M . This equates to cash position of about 2.2/sh...3. Current revenue has declined year over year to around 427M. MC = 151*9 =1.36 Billion. Not a good ratio for company that is suppose to grow. Forget the hype and size of the maket numbers they are always hyped up to make it look good...4. Growth fund managers are selling this due to negative news and nothing positive to hang the news with ACA being repealed...5. If you must check back in Jan next year...6. Lastly, I expect this stock to trade below % some time next year. Why? The news on client cancelling due to unforeseen events is bad since they are all in the same boat in health care. Things are going to be tough for next couple years with health industry after years of bloated billings...7. Don't be surprised if MMs push prices up to unload shares they bought. Good Luck to all and do your due diligence..."
"Half of the restricted stock is becoming available on April 2nd... Time to get out of the way.

"From the message board and top performing team they fired in Lansing Michigan Inovalon wants the Lansing office to help them make them successful for the first quarter of 2017. However when they close our location down, GOOD LUCK MAKING YOUR SECOND QUARTER SUCCESSUFL!!!! We were a top performing location for this company. They were going to help us find jobs, and have a job board, DID NOT HAPPEN!! This company does not care about it's employees, only the bottom line. Top management will get their raise, and bonus, and not even give a second thought to the Lansing Office Employees. I would not be surprised if Inovalon is around in the next couple of years. Inovalon is a very dishonest company.RIP INOV customers are going with the employees that are getting jobs at competitors"

"new all time high intraday today, high close...going back to 2015 post IPO trading, the only people in the stock who show a loss are shorts. There is a school of thought which says the safest place to buy a stock in when it is in new all time high territory for that reason."

INOV has $6+ a share in cash after debt along with 92 million a year in free cash flow and 40+ million a year in leveraged free cash flow. This customer drop out is unfortunate but a one time event.
