I've never seen a company go public then buy back shares one month later to prop up the price. Definitely a first!

Thoughts? Can we expect any sort of recovery to IPO price & < in the coming weeks?
"Is their corporation AI primarily based around the keyboard as it's primary moneymaker in the future? At some point in the the near future I see manual typing occurring less and less and eventually a thing of the past. It's so last century...I'm also not crazy about a bot coming up with answers for me in dealing with social interaction at this point. One issue is as it gets more intelligent, as of course it will, is that it will attempt to do more thinking for you. I see this being negative on two fronts, one, that you simply won't need to think quite as much yourself on human interactions, and, two, that the thinking programmed in is from a different country, thus a different culture and may not come up with the appropriate at times."

I too jumped in. I suspect the stock isn't moving much today because it's the end of the month as well as the quarter. Institutions will start taking new positions starting next week. I believe we'll see this stock begin to move in the coming weeks and months.
