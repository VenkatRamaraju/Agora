CTK - Touch Pal Keyboard with Talia: https://youtu.be/TUXXerl1PlQ
Shares Outstanding 61.22MFloat 4.38M% Held by Insiders 4.05%% Held by Institutions 1.34%What's wrong with that picture?
I too jumped in. I suspect the stock isn't moving much today because it's the end of the month as well as the quarter. Institutions will start taking new positions starting next week. I believe we'll see this stock begin to move in the coming weeks and months.
at last some action :)
CTK reached a new 52 Week Low at $8.52
I've never seen a company go public then buy back shares one month later to prop up the price. Definitely a first!
"Net revenue of US$105.7 million, from expected $112.16 million.GAAP EPS of -$0.01 from expected -$0.25.The most important notice is the increase of daily active users (16% respect Q3 2019)"
"I have been adding more in my position, it should get to $2 this week or early next week."
"New IPO and no volume, it’s not going anywhere, it will get dried out quickly."
"I got in last week, glad that is moving up now. CTK should be sitting around $2 soon and then move to $4. easy 4x profits!!!"
Earnings pending… buy more?
"what's going on? This company 2021 revenue is about half billion but market cap only 200millions. Also,they are getting to be profitable soon. Why it‘s currently trading under $2 ? So confused."
"Just dipped my toe in here with a few shares. Looks undervalued in many aspects considering the tech bubble. Management looks very good. That being said my main concerns are despite large revenue it’s still not profitable also, can it grow even further? Any opinion greatly appreciated especially from the old timers"
CTK reached a new 52 Week Low at $5.40
I'll be looking for another positive earnings surprise.. Would think we will soon see July prices again.. hehe THE MAX
"why does this company have such a low float percentage? Only 7%. I am a bit mystified, I think it's the first stock I find with such a low float%"
I just went first date raw dog on this stock. The dice have left the hand.
"Bought couple thousand shares because these are my initials. Bollinger bands be damned, let’s get back to $7/sh now."

"Not much attention, low volume but this is going one way only"
I wonder about this stock and many other Chinese. They earns well but continue to drop for some “unknown” reason sometimes.
Heard from son.. all China companies need to pass audit or be removed from market here in US.. anyone know more about this? THE MAX
Will rise up again ?  Which is fair price for this stock ?
"What’s behind this stock dropping? It’s stopped growing, cost to attract/maintain users > revenue generated from ads? Does anyone know if their product is any good"
