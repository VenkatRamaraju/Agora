"I got in last week, glad that is moving up now. CTK should be sitting around $2 soon and then move to $4. easy 4x profits!!!"
Will rise up again ?  Which is fair price for this stock ?
I'm in. Taking advantage of getting this below its IPO price. Too good to pass up. https://www.nanalyze.com/2018/08/100-million-chinese-artificial-intelligence-ipo/
"what's going on? This company 2021 revenue is about half billion but market cap only 200millions. Also,they are getting to be profitable soon. Why it‘s currently trading under $2 ? So confused."
"I have been adding more in my position, it should get to $2 this week or early next week."

"Just dipped my toe in here with a few shares. Looks undervalued in many aspects considering the tech bubble. Management looks very good. That being said my main concerns are despite large revenue it’s still not profitable also, can it grow even further? Any opinion greatly appreciated especially from the old timers"
earnings next monday ??

I wonder about this stock and many other Chinese. They earns well but continue to drop for some “unknown” reason sometimes.
