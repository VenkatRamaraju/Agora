"Hmm, this Baby is down on no news that I can find, even as the market is solidly up. She reports earnings tomorrow morning before the open, and I am expecting a very good ER, beats on EPS and Revenue. Why down today? Earnings jitters among traders/investors?? Maybe. I still plan to go Long in a big way before the close today, because I don't see anything concrete that changes my bullish opinion about the ER, or how the stock should respond to a good Earnings Release, especially if she is down 2% or so today."

"LW is off a measly 0.3% from 52week HI! LW is on my long watch list, and comparing to all other companies, they are by far the least impacted by the recent market slow down. Simply amazing. I first noticed the company this month when they showed daily gains when the ENTIRE rest of the list was in red territory. They repeated that twice this month. Next month will two years since they were spun out of ConAg. They are appreciating quite handily! Twenty four months and they are up 150%. I wonder why ConAg cut them loose???"
"easily can go below 50, support maybe @ 46-47 level"

What!! $#@% Down 5 after blowout earnings?

FAKE SELL OFF
LW reached a new All Time High at 64.94
Love. Love. Love this for long term. Excellent entry price. Cheers to 70’s in 6-8 months
"Still long LW here, I got very lucky on this one, so will try to ride her higher until about...3:45 ET, then gonna jump into CMC as my next earnings play. I am a LITTLE less bullish on CMC than I was on LW. I analyze 24 criteria on every Earnings play I consider, assigning either + or -, negative or positive, to each one. On LW, I had 21 positive and only 3 negative, which is just about the strongest imbalance I have found. On CMC, I see 18 positive, 6 negative, which is still more than enough to convince me to make the play. :-)"
"Yahoo seems to be eating my posts, maybe I exceeded my daily limit. :-) Anyway, went Long 900 shares of LW at $84.07, just before market close. Expecting very good earnings and a nice pop up in price tomorrow. After this on, I will move on to CMC as a Long play, planning to sell LW during the regular session tomorrow, and immediately jump into CMC. But will be doing my manual labor job all day, so cannot monitor the action or overload Yahoo with 50+ posts like I did today. :-) Best of Luck to All!"

"If you study the earnings history of LW, you see that they ALWAYS beat on EPS and Revenue, yet the stock has sold off several times, immediately after releasing very good earnings. This time around, the stock sold off YESTERDAY, just before this earnings release. Interesting to me. Makes me wonder if maybe some ""insiders"" knew the ER would not just be good, but exceptionally good, and so manipulated things so as to be able to get in at a very good price just before the release. Just a thought, no way to know for sure, of course."
Gonna take 2 years for this to get back above $60….

I thought packaged foods and processed food companies were out of favor because people's food choices have changed.
When did they raise the div?

"It looks like good numbers, why down?"
Earnings tomorrow. promising as rest are opening

What a great company. I should have dumped my Conagra and bought more LW.
LW reached an all time high at 87.55
Have held my LW shares since the ConAgra spinoff. Very pleased. LW frozen food forecast should help CAG get to 40 soon. Loading up on more CAG while watching LW grow.
"I am currently researching this stud stock, errr spud stock, as a Potentially Profitable Potato Play (PPPP). LW reports earnings on Jan. 3, and I think there is very good upside potential here, both as a pre-earnings and a pure earnings play to the Long side. This appears to be an extremely well-managed company holding a strong position in a specialty food space. Pretty much all they do is potatoes, BUT they have a very broad, international market, 13 billion $ market cap, and I think potatoes are a great place to be. The potato is a food staple for both the lower and middle class. It dwells harmoniously within the tummies of both vegetarians and meat lovers. It is not the healthiest food on the planet, but it is pretty darn good for you and seems to have avoided most nutritionist condemnation. International cravings for potatoes should remain strong in the coming years, and this company is poised to grow in profitability. Last quarter, they missed on consensus EPs by one penny, some kind of potato harvesting problem appears to have had marginal impact on earnings. BUT, look at the earnings history here, going back TWELVE quarters. They have neatewn the REvenue consensus ALL twelve quarters. And they beat EPS 11 out of 12, only missing once, by that one penny, last quarter. A stellar record! I am expecting a very positive earnings report, beats on EPS and Revenue, and good Guidance on January 3rd. This stock is currently fairly valued. Not cheap, but not expensive either. A pop up into the $90's is likely in response to a good earnings report, IMO, and I am planning to go Long at some point before earnings release, and to hold this through earnings."
"In about 5 minutes, assuming she is under $94.07, I'm going so slap a $94.07 Limit Sell order on this Baby. I want the perfect symmetry of in at $84.07, out at $94.07. :-)"
Who thinks Post will now make a bid for LW?
"It’s just a little glitch, hold on. Looking for $70 !"

"On Aug. 11, the company amended both of its credit agreements. The amendment to the revolver increased its size, to $1 billion from $750 million, extended its maturity and made various changes to the negative covenants. The amendment to the term loan contained conforming changes to the negative covenants in the revolver. Read the full conclusions here: https://reorg.com/lamb-weston-debt/"

Why down today? Earnings and guidance were great yesterday.
"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 4, 2019. This provider of frozen potato products flaunts a splendid surprise history. Notably, the company has outperformed both earnings and sales estimates ever since its spin-off from Conagra Brands CAG. Let’s see how things are shaping up ahead of this earnings releaseyeh"
This has happened the last couple days. Somebody sells a couple hundred shares at a low price to try and panic investors. Should be reported to SEC.
Profitable and RAISED Guidance... Gonna climb back up to $80.00
Lamb Weston is down 8.78% to 55.37
"OVERBOUGHT, Definitely....It should retreat fast to $68's.."

Lamb Weston is down 7.93% to 64.91
What happend?
Hedge funds dump shares then buy back in at lower prices after scaring the small investor out.
"CEO and his team are not to forthcoming on potato quality and the expected cost of this historic poor crop. Potato are the largest input into their products, think they know more than they are willing to release. I don't think some SKU rationalization is going to save the fiscal year. Lots of reactive talking points. Lets see if the CEO can lead through a seriously rough year. Get proactive before the spuds melt in the storages."
"Out LW at $93.83 for a very very VERY nice profit on 900 shares. Potatoes for the Win! :-) Now Long 3600 shares of CMC at $22.27. Working all next week, every weekday, so can only do a lot of occasional cell phone monitoring, but you can be sure I will be checking up on my new Baby on Monday. :-) Best of Luck to All!"
LW reached a new All Time High at $74.66
"Taking a break in the employee cafeteria. So nice to see this is at the $92 level! Must find a potato or 2 or 3 or 4 to eat for lunch! :-) Gonna stick with this Baby for a few more hours, maybe she can get even perkier?! :-) Hate using cell phone for typing, though. My Fat Fingers need a computer keyboard for this! Congrats and have a lunchtime potato on me! :-)"
Getting ready for the bounce back up. Long over 73.29 for a run up to 85.60. http://www.foxchart.com/share/298691402.png
