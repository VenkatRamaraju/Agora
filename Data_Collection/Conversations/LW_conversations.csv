Wow....trading volume over 3 times normal. Revenue & earnings up....guess guidance disappointed. Looks like an opportunity to me.
Love. Love. Love this for long term. Excellent entry price. Cheers to 70’s in 6-8 months
"easily can go below 50, support maybe @ 46-47 level"
"Yahoo seems to be eating my posts, maybe I exceeded my daily limit. :-) Anyway, went Long 900 shares of LW at $84.07, just before market close. Expecting very good earnings and a nice pop up in price tomorrow. After this on, I will move on to CMC as a Long play, planning to sell LW during the regular session tomorrow, and immediately jump into CMC. But will be doing my manual labor job all day, so cannot monitor the action or overload Yahoo with 50+ posts like I did today. :-) Best of Luck to All!"
Why the 2.42 drop this a.m.?
Earnings tomorrow. promising as rest are opening
Worth $8.4bb!
Gonna take 2 years for this to get back above $60….
"Out LW at $93.83 for a very very VERY nice profit on 900 shares. Potatoes for the Win! :-) Now Long 3600 shares of CMC at $22.27. Working all next week, every weekday, so can only do a lot of occasional cell phone monitoring, but you can be sure I will be checking up on my new Baby on Monday. :-) Best of Luck to All!"
"CEO and his team are not to forthcoming on potato quality and the expected cost of this historic poor crop. Potato are the largest input into their products, think they know more than they are willing to release. I don't think some SKU rationalization is going to save the fiscal year. Lots of reactive talking points. Lets see if the CEO can lead through a seriously rough year. Get proactive before the spuds melt in the storages."
"I am currently researching this stud stock, errr spud stock, as a Potentially Profitable Potato Play (PPPP). LW reports earnings on Jan. 3, and I think there is very good upside potential here, both as a pre-earnings and a pure earnings play to the Long side. This appears to be an extremely well-managed company holding a strong position in a specialty food space. Pretty much all they do is potatoes, BUT they have a very broad, international market, 13 billion $ market cap, and I think potatoes are a great place to be. The potato is a food staple for both the lower and middle class. It dwells harmoniously within the tummies of both vegetarians and meat lovers. It is not the healthiest food on the planet, but it is pretty darn good for you and seems to have avoided most nutritionist condemnation. International cravings for potatoes should remain strong in the coming years, and this company is poised to grow in profitability. Last quarter, they missed on consensus EPs by one penny, some kind of potato harvesting problem appears to have had marginal impact on earnings. BUT, look at the earnings history here, going back TWELVE quarters. They have neatewn the REvenue consensus ALL twelve quarters. And they beat EPS 11 out of 12, only missing once, by that one penny, last quarter. A stellar record! I am expecting a very positive earnings report, beats on EPS and Revenue, and good Guidance on January 3rd. This stock is currently fairly valued. Not cheap, but not expensive either. A pop up into the $90's is likely in response to a good earnings report, IMO, and I am planning to go Long at some point before earnings release, and to hold this through earnings."
"It looks like good numbers, why down?"
New 52 week high; management just keeps performing.
Bought some more at this cheap prices 
"On Aug. 11, the company amended both of its credit agreements. The amendment to the revolver increased its size, to $1 billion from $750 million, extended its maturity and made various changes to the negative covenants. The amendment to the term loan contained conforming changes to the negative covenants in the revolver. Read the full conclusions here: https://reorg.com/lamb-weston-debt/"
"Hmm, this Baby is down on no news that I can find, even as the market is solidly up. She reports earnings tomorrow morning before the open, and I am expecting a very good ER, beats on EPS and Revenue. Why down today? Earnings jitters among traders/investors?? Maybe. I still plan to go Long in a big way before the close today, because I don't see anything concrete that changes my bullish opinion about the ER, or how the stock should respond to a good Earnings Release, especially if she is down 2% or so today."
Why down today? Earnings and guidance were great yesterday.
"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 4, 2019. This provider of frozen potato products flaunts a splendid surprise history. Notably, the company has outperformed both earnings and sales estimates ever since its spin-off from Conagra Brands CAG. Let’s see how things are shaping up ahead of this earnings releaseyeh"
French Fries make money. But are boring. That's why nobody comes here to play.
