$60+ coming
why was this stock down on positive earnings beat?
Added Friday lows we'll buy more
Deep sell off with no news?..it is probably going to issue stocks or new debt. That is usually the reason
this current hedge fund buying shares feels like trouble for ceo and directors.which is good as this company has fallen asleep. I'm buying shares and will vote to get these guys out. then stock goes to $75
"Eli Lilly grown company plus Bayer animal health business should be a tremendous force and importantly a stronger proposition for pet health. If you look at what Zoetis has done the last 5 years, it is clear this is a tremendous growth business. ELAN Insiders are acting in tandem with that with their personal wallets.Good luck to all"
"This looks like a great stock to own, but at what price? This company looks like a win win stock, but it could drop based on the fact that it is not cheap based on earnings. However, if they can’t get earnings rolling along it becomes a wonderful takeover/merger candidate for another animal healthcare company. My question is how low can it go on less than stellar earnings growth in the short term?"
Anyone know what percent of revenue soresto collar is? It looks like it might get taken off the market. I am surprised this isn't down more.
ELAT is down 11.05% to 48.37
Wow. Zacks Equity Research wrong again.
"Buying everyday, will support Hedge Fund, $40 soon"
"$ELAN is the next $ZTS they are consolidating the $BAYRY animal health business and will emerge as a big winner. The time is now for animal health, how many people do you know who have recently got a companion pet?"
Is it already listed? Is this stock trading at a fixed price? I'm confused ...
Looks like a potential short squeeze here towards the gap at 22.93 or Quarterly Pivot 23.41
They had some interesting insights about ELAN on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"$14 BILLION market cap, even after the haircut, and no E in the PE ratio ?Didn't this thing get jettisoned by Pfizer 15 years ago ?"
"Pet health. If you're buying $ELAN now, you are buying before everyone realizes the opportunity. So many new pet owners this year, in addition to the average amount rising in what the customer is willing to spend, there is a huge secular trend behind this industry. $CHWY $ZTS"
ELAN is down 5.43% to 31.50
"down on this many shares has to be LLY, then again the LLY ceo isn 't that sharp, hopefully they let the stock breath"
"Wow, not a very active board. Own PETX, which ELSN agreed to buy today. This will be a big for Elan. They will have a marketing majority on medical pet care products. I’m holding PETX shares (purchase agreement = 0.1418 shares of Elan), and buying Elan on dips. GL to all who have stuck with Elan."
When this is going to ipo?
"Now that the sale has gone through, are any of the under water PETX shareholders going to hold onto ELAN shares. Looking at ELAN, it seems like they've been playing second fiddle to ZTS and IDXX with lower margins as well as balance sheet saddled with debt. So is it worth holding shares or just sell and buy the big dog Zoetis?"
This stock should be a safe haven in a down market but its not acting that way. Current share price should be a good buying level IMO.
"Someone bought half a million in calls on this today, someone knows something pre-earnings hmmm"
"Compared to every other Animal Health company this one is struggling. I’ve been studying this company for years and it seems to me they are making it on the perception “animal health companies are a good investment” more than actual good decisions. Zoetis may not have been doing great, at the same point, as a public company but everyone knew they had a pipeline full of products coming. They had manufacturing issues but didn’t have R&D issues. Ive been trying to find out what this place has in R&D and I’m getting nowhere. Their spending on it is minimal so that tells me all I need to know. I’m taking a much smaller position on this as of today. Good luck"
"Elanco is coming back from the dead as a solid, long term hold especially with the Bayer deal completed. Go ELAN!"
Finally the bump (9.64%) we need to make this off to the races. Go ELAN!
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
ceo bought 500k of shares ... good sign.
"Story in NBC news tonight about the purported dangers of Soresto. This stock seems to be teflon on the news. Even if it isn't taken off the market, consumers will be weary of it."
"This stock may not move much till late 2021. By that time, financials shouldmshow how well Bayer acquisition is digested. As of now, ElanCo on its own has been a disappointment as compared to other Animal Health companies. Let's see if Bayer products and people provide any new dynamics."
"Soresto collar user experience, me. When I replaced the collar on my golden last fall within a week I removed 10ticks,which was strange as we,d had none in previous years. We found out through our on line group the Chinese were counterfeiting them. Ours was bought via Amazon. Since then we get them from the vet. It's extremely effective and anyone who thinks they should stop using them should give their head a shake."
"I see the ""ambulance chasing"" law firms are ramping up against ELAN in a weak veiled attempt to extort money due to the recent earnings report. Do these firms ever stop? Most of the time they are like the spam emailers that if they even get a few ""bites"" they make money, so why not go after everybody? The sad thing is that it costs US SHAREHOLDERS - the OWNERS of the company money because the company has to get their legal team to focus on ""stomping out the ants."" Total BS!"
"ER tomorrow morning before the market opens.Will it be blow them out of the water good or head for the hills - Dive, Dive?"
Cramer tonight said to buy.
News out FDA approval
I have begun accumulating shares as I believe the $KIN acquisition will position $ELAN very nicely.
"Thank God I never participated in the offer from Eli Lilly. I don't remember how long ago it was, but it looks as if this thing has done nothing but go down since."
"Seresto, one of the most popular flea and tick collars in the country, has been linked to hundreds of pet deaths. A product acquired from Bayer.This could hurt!"
the company is 70 years old and struggles to make a profit year to year. What is going on here?
