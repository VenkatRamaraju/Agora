Mornin Bulls!
Ortex estimating 9.95Million shares short as of today... LOL
Everyone 'out of the pool' before earnings next week. Thanks again for another great buy opportunity. 
"Way way 2 much oversoldLater this week when people realize what has happened and they overcome their fear, they will jump inHopefully strong personalities who will hold for years to come"
bought 700 shares on this mindless 20% drop
"At sub $15, I can just keep buying more and more and more and more."
Told you 10 is next looks like BATMAN'S prediction was correct it's dropping. 
"vfdvefvf4 days agoEvery single day short sellers collectively pay $60,000 in feesThats .01c per share, if the shorted yesterday their up .40c per share. If the shorted a month ago it cost them .30c and their up $5.00 per share"
"a BLM question on an earnings call, insert eye roll"
"In a wait and see mode for me.Could be a Triple Top reversal pattern forming if price movement starts heading down and tests support level. Of course, then it could be a failed Triple Top reversal if support holds.On the bullish side, it looks like a possible bullish rectangle. Just need to have a breakout of resistance."
it's nice to see this not moving with Tesla. we're independent!
"Know what you have investors. Dynamic Fun EV, in years FUV will be everywhere. Happy to be part of a unique company. Let's relax & revisit for years to come! Today is just a blimp on the radar!"
"Looks like the trading war on FUV has settled into a stalemate between short-sellers and longs around $14 a share, ie market cap of $500M. Everyone is entrenched in their respective positions, and moves in one direction tend to be met with a counteroffensive the following day pulling the stock back to the $14 stalemate. A little bit like WWI: as long as forces were balanced, the Germans, the French and the British were just killing each other with no significant progress one way or another. It stopped being a war of movement, it was butchery pure and simple. Until a strategic shift in the balance of power happened, and that was the US engagement in 1917. After that, it was only a matter of time before German forces collapsed. With FUV, the strategic shift is asymetrical: shorties can only look for some level of catastrophic failure of the company in order for them to win the war. And that is plainly not possible, at least for the next couple of years. Of course, FUV could temporarily disappoint for a quarter, maybe two, but who cares. The only thing that will happen for sure is that FUV will start taking off, at least to some degree. When that happens, the market will always give credit and hope for a bright future. And since the short selling position is overleveraged, it will collapse under the pressure of the moment. Even if FUV long term success is mitigated. Worst case scenario: FUV will peak around $50 a share (that would be about $1.5Bn in market cap) within the next 24 months; best case scenario: FUV stock price will exceed $200 and maybe up to $500 a share (i.e. $6bn = Polaris, to $15Bn in market cap = nothing more than 3 times Nikola today) within the next 5 years. In either case, short sellers hoping for FUV to crash below $5 will loose the war. Being long on FUV seems to be the safest bet today, imo."
Come on let's get back those losses.......
Those who sell will lose.
"Arcimoto Build in The USAA lot of competitor EV's are fabricated in China with huge shipping cost(and going higher)it is cheaper to ship a container with parts then shipping complete build units This company is way ahead on competition And with China closing airports and areas of China this will keep going Good Luck to all, Made in the USA"

"They have products, they produce cars, year over year revenue is off the chart. That is bad? lol."
So you tell me i well get this company for cheaper :) Diamond Hard lets All Hope for citys with fresh ait:)
sheessshhh 10% intraday swing. man I don't even know why I still check the price daily when I have no intention of selling 
The reality is this stock has such low volumes its an easy target for price manipulation without any news or updates specific to the company. These price changes are not a reflection of the business (what the stock market used to be about) but more about the whims of day traders.
"July options market ended today. Weird trading day overall, but FUV his holding its ground well. We move forward!"
Fm Walt88...Marketing= Superb!! R&D=Superb!! AMP2= Hello??
Options market is looking very bullish for us. Much larger call to put ratio  
I remember it was not so long ago when I thought that $24 was an attractive price to buy. I have to thank BATMAN and all the shorties who have allowed me to buy at $9.00: thank you thank you thank you!
Just hold boys & girls Fuv is going 2 be huge in a few years!

"Morning longs, I'm still here."
"Hate to say that I called this, but look back a few posts, John W your exactly right!! GLTA Peace C"
Is the green day run going to end today?
"The longer it stays down, the better it is for us longs. This enables us to load more shares at a discounted price. If your investment horizon is years and not months, this should be considered a gift."
"Looks like we'll be testing resistance again soon around $17.50 areas. Really hoping for a breakout this time around. Thought last time we had a breakout from cup and handle, but that failed. We are still in the handle though. 3 white soldiers this week was bullish as we passed 20 DMA and moved into buy territory in upper Bollinger band. I think cup and handle is still intact??? Not sure on criteria how long a handle can be.I think I may have been misreading tea leaves and hoping others can correct me when I'm wrong. There can't be a double bottom because that only happens in a down trend. It was a double top which is bearish. And now we may be seeing a triple top. Good news is double top didn't signal a reversal of up trend. Bad news is if we test and break support after triple top, that is confirmation of triple top which is bearish. Good volume on strong up day so I'm hopeful we finally break out of resistance in coming week or two."
@Buckporno on Twitter believes they found a leaked video of Arcimoto’s platform 2… looks to have potential!
Out of ammo already shorts?
"Closing near high today would be good. Would form 3 white soldier candlesticks and maybe get interest in some technical day traders. Also, always nice to have more bullish indicators on short term trend up. Maybe have a double bottom forming too?"
Back from lunch  let’s squeezeeeeeee up 
"Yep, big miss on EPS"
"Earnings coming up fast. I'm not expecting any big positive or negative surprises. I doubt production is up by any significant % from previously stated #'s which ultimately equates to sales figures. I strongly think slow, steady pace of existing production is Arcimoto's plan until they can bring their new facility and other mass production online. ATVM loan is significant news that we hopefully will know if Arcimoto is approved or not before end of year."
"very low volume, probably FUV supporters out for Labor Day weekend. As usual, no new news, still a 5% dip..."
What’s more important than squeeze is the future of transportation is this type of American made vehicle. It has a unique space due to size and ease of operation.
This is very upsetting. stock down like $6 per share in 2 tradings days. Mark is not doing us any favors.
Short borrow fee rate update... 27.68%
"Weak hands. That's all. Nothing of the fundamentals has changed, only taking them a little longer to ramp up production. I view this as a positive development. It gives us longs another great buying opportunity. In the long run this is just noise."
"As per Gary Black:""Larger $3T Dems only infrastructure bill will then start which should include $10k EV credit ($7.5K+$2.5K made in America). Mid-Sept timing.""Assuming it extends to 3 wheeled vehicles, I believe $FUV stands to be the biggest beneficiary of the EV tax credit."
"@Green novice, your strategy is is solid. I also have 2 dip buys pending; 1, is a good possibility ( that may go but would only hit and run back up. #2, is a pipedream. But you never know. Making money is the name of the game. My bulk of my holdings is for long term. Very solid co. here, with great potential. 18 close is very doable today IMO. GLTA Peace C"
How does it go up 12% to 2%. Unreal
"Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.23, misses by $0.06.Revenue of $0.72M (+148.3% Y/Y), misses by $1.4M."
"Hmmm...just seems like today is mostly correction as some big tech companies still have to post earnings. A lot that already released earnings beat estimates. Seems like correction, buy the dip before other big tech earnings, then sell on the news. Keeping my buy order at $13.50 open in case it dips that low. I'll be a bag holder after that if price continues to dip past that short term. Not best case scenario for shares I want to trade, but that's why I like trading stocks I'm long on. If on wrong side of short term trade, I just need to wait it out."
"Good recovery in lots of stocks I watch from yesterday's market big drop. None of my other buy orders triggered, but I think I'll setup a $16 sell price for the shares I picked up yesterday at $14. Hopefully we'll see sideways or a bit up for FUV the next few days before next general selloff after more earnings announcements.Totally didn't see breaking support at 20 day SMA yesterday coming, but I don't think it would have happened if it wasn't for the overall market correction yesterday. Hopefully we close around support (~$15) today."
"Hey guys and gals, i just posted a video covering the summer showcase event last week. My YouTube channel is TheBuyinKing"
"Good analysis, watch it, seems like there are some fleet/commercial pre-orders as wellhttps://youtu.be/LFUXoQxfGKI"
Excellent! Up more than %5 after I sold some shares yesterday. I have another sell order for when we hit $17 that will help stock breakout.
"The video they just put up is very effective communication. If it is a preview of the quarterly results, we are going to have a ball in a month from now. Short sellers are on notice, imo."
"Say what you will, earning miss due supply shortage. loading opportunity for me. Short will be short, I'm sure it's at least around 50% interest after today."
we're at new highs in short interest of 11.4Million and the stock goes up. Whats next? 15Million shares short!? Shorts are finally losing control it looks like. ALL of them will eventually be net buyers of the stock to cover their positions.
"I'll be nack with you shortly. Been busy on RDHL which is a covid play. I usually don't post about othet stocks, but I like the FUV longs so decided to at least let you know about it ahead of time. They are about to release results of a ph2/3 clinical study that are expected yo be good. If they are indeed, this will rocket 300% to 500% easily. If not, it will collapse 30-40%. I know I will get a lot of tbumbs down for this post, but I fon't care. Maybe a few of you will thank me later. This post will have zero impact on sp and I'm only writing with a good intent. FYI."
just picked up a few shares at 11.70.
The problem with this earnings call was OUTSIDE expectations that did not get met. The company did produce a lower amount of vehicle than Q1 which is concerning. Could it honestly be a shortage in chips? I don't know. They did post record revenue compared to Q1. I will say market makers put this stock in a very tough situation with high expectations. Mark also did not do us any favors. He sounded more concerned with getting rentals out than getting actual product into consumers hands. He is upping his marketing thought with ads now on youtube. Just very tough spot at the moment.
New high @ 40

Last year FUV went from three dollars to $35￼The real world story here is the rental market. Especially company owned stores.

Stop blaming short sellers, if you didn’t take some profits at 18 bucks, that’s your problem.Reality is we’ve been here before￼. This is probably an excellent time to step in to the fire.

5 consecutive green day closes. Will today be the 6th? Have to take a breather eventually. We tested resistance Monday on huge price up and high volume. Couldn't break out and closed near low of that day (still green though). 50 day SMA bullish crossover of 200 day SMA (golden cross) today or perhaps tomorrow.
They had some interesting insights about FUV on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
When is that big jump in price suppose to happen? To me this thing looks flat to down.
"They have 27 units in rental fleets, ASP in Q2 was $22,000 (an increase QoQ)"
Yikes! Didn't expect my $14 buy order to be triggered today. Overall market taking a big hit today. Still haven't read up on reason. Question is...trend is your friend or buy the fear? I have one more buy order set at $13.50. I may cancel that one until I understand what's going on with overall market.
"yawn, wake me up in 2 years when the stock price is in the triple digits."
Ross Gerber said on a Meet Kevin’s live stream that he owns Arcimoto stock. He said it’s ‘bigger than his Beachbody ($BODY) position.’ But didn’t disclose how much that really is.
https://youtu.be/DkUOWGv1qLs
"What the heck, I'll bite. Buy order placed at $15.10 if it dips that low again today.Thought something like this might have happened after earnings, not before earnings. Feeling like gambling a bit before earnings. Hopefully can sell at profit before close on Monday. Will cry if dips further."
"nice calm day, up a little bit as shorts stay short. Let's get back to fundamentals!"
"Pretty calm today, very bullish long term. ATVM loan, production, partners, and new technologies can be HUGE catalysts in short term"
"Also bought some options for December 2022, very good dip"
"Looks like I snoozed and lost. I didn't do my $10 buy order until after it already dipped below that and was back over it. I would have been able to do a 5% trade in 1 day.Buy order is in now, but I may be a day late and a dollar short. We'll see next week since Feds news overreaction should be over and market sentiment will shift yet again until next ""bad news""."
"Absolutely no news, just short attack before earning call and before the expiry of August 20 optionsBuy the dip and let it run"
Do you think 40% down is correct?what is the fair share price for now?
"In a directionless market looking for meaning, here's a thought: the best hedge against inflation is growth stocks, with growth rates dwarfing any expected rise in inflation. Is there a better investment than in a business that is methodically building and deploying key strategic assets (products, capabilities, partnerships and relationships) and which is at the very beginning of its revenue curve? Going from 100 vehicles/year to 20,000 vehicles/year in 4 years is 275% growth rate per year... It is fair to say that FUV EV will mostly be correlated to its explosive revenue growth for at least the next 5 years, even if the 275%-ish rate is heavily discounted for the purpose of EV modeling over the next 4 years.I do not see many other uncorrelated investment classes available to retail investors fearing inflation at this point in time other than growth stocks, and among them, those that have already eliminated a lot of early stage investment risks (proven technology, proven team, proven product concept, and already at the stage of testing proof of product-market fit). Your thoughts?"
Looks like short buy-backs are beginning! Couple of large ones rolled by.
Let's have a fun week bulls!
Driverless FUV next. Arcimoto rallies after showing off driverless FUVhttps://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3720519-arcimoto-rallies-after-showing-off-driverless-fuv
"Off to a decent start today.Gapped up on opening on good buying pressure, but gap was quickly filled. Initial thoughts are today will be boring sideways trading more or less. Decent uptick in price currently, but it's still early. Bollinger bands tightening is one of my favorite indicators. Doesn't say which way stock will move, but indicates a big move in either direction is likely to happen tighter it gets. Keeping my sell order at $16. That appears to be a resistance level. I hope we close above that though. I just need to lock in profits on my trading shares. I'm fully load already on my long term FUV shares. Will wait until after Q2 earnings to see if I will accumulate more long term shares or wait until Q3 earnings. Will be doing lots of short term trading in the meantime."
"Two important valuation considerations:The Pacific Metals Fab building is STILL OCCUPIED by the seller. The sale was SIX MONTHS ago.This will delay cleaning, retrofitting and volume production into 2023.Does anyone on this board track recalls? They are appallingly high at 61 RECALLS total since inception.The recall frequency has not abated at all. The 2020 and 2021 models of all platforms are involvedand repairs are less than one third completed. (per NHTSA filings)I admit that eventual reward is potential 10x, though the risk of bankruptcy is high."
"Another opportunity day to buy low. As I see it, there is no risk of default by the company, management is very methodically executing on its strategy and effectively so. Each new piece of news reinforces my confidence in them, and in the growth potential of the company. If longs are bailing now, I feel for them but they are giving part of their investment to shorties and market makers for no reason at all. Where is the need for flight to safety? being invested in this business is the safest place to be right now, imo."
My favourite company.
"I think the key here is that their fleet strategy (rentals, service, rapid response) rather than focusing on consumer sales (per se) is what makes this all click. They have a sound business strategy, and a good plan to increase production within their means. The nice thing about this company is that it is all results driven and not hype driven: Here's things we are trying a b c, here's things we know x y z, and here's our near term plan to increase availability. it doesn't have to go to 100...if they can build a new base at 20 (looks like they have a nice base at 14 or so) they can build off of that. The real question is does somebody want to scoop them up and try to expand too fast...which might be exactly the wrong strategy since the demand isn't there yet to meet those dreams)."
"whelp, the good news is if this happens again, it won't impact my portfolio nearly as much. :/"
Last two trading days are perfect example why stop losses are a good idea. I will give it a few days to settle down and figure out my trading strategy. Likely to be a dead cat bounce coming up eventually before stock price finds a strong support level. Shorts that are swing and day traders need to lock in profits if they're smart.
"In Q2, manufactured 74 vehicles and completed sales for 30 new and 1 pre-owned customer vehicle.lol... sold only 30 cars."
"Today's drop brought to you courtesy of hedge funds. If they didn't drop to these levels, there would have been a game squeeze in order to hedge the options in play. No biggy... accumulate!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvPBNwGjIeI Love to see it
"It’s kinda funny that some people are throwing rocks at FUV for lack of deliveries in the middle of a pandemic. Deliveries coming out of a startup manufacturing plant that is truthfully just a proof of concept facility. If you are investing in this company for the production out of this facility, you are missing the point. It’s about the rAMP and all the rAMPs to come. Across the US and around the world."
The owners of arkamoto made a new song telling telling everyone to holdal
Shorts at it again
Really bad figures
"the sentiment of delusional newbie ""investors"", where they are trying to cheer themselves up and persuade one another to buy more, tells me the stock is going to go south. MMs are unloading shares into the hands of a crowd of likes of those who speak of 20´s next week."
"Niche business, will be huge in a few years once they can start delivering & execute!You will see Fuv vehicles at a ton of resorts. Sit back & enjoy the ride. Cheers!"
"Whats your guys thoughts on Q3? Im saying they deliver 110 units to customers ($2.5M revenue), 24cents loss per share, and $100,000 in rentals revenue. I think Q3 will be nice to see despite a miss in analyst expectations of .17 cents loss per share and ~$3.5M in revenues... The short term doesn't matter so much.. But I am hoping that their 2022 guidance for production/deliveries in the Q3 earnings call is significantly more than 2021. Anything over 2,500 units guided for 2022 and I will be very very happy. At and average selling price of $22,000 in 2022 and 2,500 sales which seems reasonable... Thats $55,000,000 in sales while they'll likely grow another 500%+ in sales in 2023 which more than easily justifies and much higher valuation. Next year which is only just a few months away from now is looking like a home run banger for Arcimoto as they scale deliveries, get the ATVM loan, and rentals grow. Im expecting smart money to jump on this soon before the momentum really gets going! If Arcimoto does $55Million in sales next year that means we're currently trading at an 8X 2022 P/S on a company that will likely do around $500,000,000 in 2023 sales with the 2nd factory coming online with a more refined product and at least a slightly lower price."
nice
Huge opportunity to buy back in under 12.Love FUV for a long term play!
"Would like to see a close above $18. Above $18 close, I will consider buying some trading shares with tight stop losses for possible breakout run to much higher highs. Until then, I'm waiting with buy orders for any sizeable dips.I'm starting to believe price going straight up is possible. :) Naw, but nice to see price walked up slowly on low volume instead of the other way around. Not sure where breakout confirmation would be, but mentally I have $18 as a key price close above."
added a bit more at $11.75. buy in little chunks and hold long term
"The good: Rentals big success, record preorders, record balance sheet growth, platform 2 prototype finished, ATVM loan progressing well, hinted Q3/Q4 are looking good, and etc...The bad: part shortages, production slow down, multi week software fix in q2.Look at it how you want, but this appears to be short term fear selling based on things that happened months ago. The future is looking awesome!"

Still @ 24 soon
"I just realized something: by default, I consider that new equity issues are dilutive: new cash brought in does not get to be valued at Enterprise multiples until it is put to work to create new value, hence the short term effect of a new issue should be dilutive. But, in the case of a start-up company like Arcimoto, new cash brought in has an immediate accretive effect, as it significantly lowers the risk of short-term business collapse by padding the balance sheet, thus lowering the applicable discount rate. The effect of lowering the business risk can be very significant on the Enterprise Value of a start-up business, and enough to compensate for the share dilution. In addition, the new cash raise mechanically increases the Market Cap by decreasing further the Net Debt (which of course was already negative for FUV). So, in the end, I believe issuing new shares for cash when properly done is a net positive for FUV shareholders. I think the last 10% increase in new stock should have easily pushed FUV market cap by an additional $50M or so, it added almost a quarter year of burn rate."
My $15 buy order just filled. Switching to accumulation mode. Setting some more lower price buy orders just in case we dip more next few days.
Wants to get to $15+ and hold it
Any news from the event?Any announcement?
I’m under the impression that the shorters soon will be in trouble…big trouble
Shorts have to be worried because we are going to the moon next week.
"Whoa, woke up to a sell order fulfilled at $17 today. Nice move up! Now that I sold more shares, price will go higher. I have two more lots ready to sell at higher price, but at same time I now have funds freed up to buy more for any pullbacks."
Margin calls coming.
"So, clearly, the short sellers are winning this round. Hopefully, this will clear the field and Arcimoto will get a more deserving base of shareholders. Here is my real fear: that these knee-jerk ""market"" reactions drive Mark Frohmayer to look for more reliable and deserving investors. If I were a growth equity fund, I'd go and make a deal Mark could not refuse: take the company private at a favorable price, get rid of stock manipulators and traders incapable of supporting a start-up project, have access to secure capital and go and run the company for a couple of years and reintroduce it in 2023/2024 for $5Bn. If Mark does this, that's where I get really screwed as a long shareholder. People of the Nasdaq, we have a responsibility as shareholders: to support the company, not try to make it weaker or dead!"
"There is no reason for this stock to move down so quickly and so much. This is nothing more than a shake down. To new traders, use this bargain opportunity to build on your portfolio and/or lower your average. DO NOT PANIC SELL!! GLTA Peace C"
I guess im picking up som more today :)
Good week ya'll. Up 17.48% and earnings call just 25 days away. Enjoy your weekend longs!
I Bought this mornings dip!
I've gotten many thumbs down for saying that EV's are our future. Everybody should be aware that manufacturing them does not necessarily produce exclusivity. There will be many players and all of them can be imitated. It's a tuff business and there is much competition ahead.
Buy the dip!

"9,250,000 SHARES SHORT AS OF AUGUST 31ST. Still an absurd number of people shorting"
"Over the last few days, I have seen my little fortune in Arcimoto (temporarily) evaporate enough that I feel entitled tonight to use this blog for a little bit of ""intellectual"" fun. If you find the following boring, my apologies in advance.I am trying to wrap my mind around how much money is actually put at play by short sellers to try to weaken Arcimoto's stock price.Let's play with a couple of numbers. So, about 10 million shares sold short. Say average selling price around $15, short sellers would have captured $150M from ""naive"" stock buyers. Short sellers get the cash first (so it looks like an OPM game, doesn't it?), but now, they do own a considerable risk (until they close their position). How much risk capital do short sellers need to allocate to take such a risk?In banking, capital adequacy ratio for commercial lending (low risk) is about 8%. For speculative business (distressed debt for example), it can go much higher (starting at 15%, and up up up). Short selling is very risky if the gambling is not biased (see later paragraph on short sellers odds of winning or losing). Let's imagine a capital adequacy ratio between 20% to 25% for short selling. To bet $150M, short sellers would need to commit $30M to $45M of their own capital. And they commit/invest this amount of capital for the purpose of taking down Arcimoto? Seems to me that they should consider investing and supporting the company be a huge success instead.Now, what about short sellers' odds of winning and losing ?In theory, the odds to predict stock price correctly in a fair and efficient capital market are 50-50. That's finance theory 101. If short sellers thought they'd play with John Doe's 50-50 odds, short selling could not be a lucrative business as short sellers have costs to cover. First, short sellers have to pay (in theory) the cost of borrowing shares. At 20% annually, say for a 3-month period on average, cost of borrowing would be $7.5M in relation to $150M. So, they must work with better odds. Just to break even on a $7.5M expense, assuming even distribution of wins vs. losses of say +/-$50M over $150M, they need odds of winning of at least 57.5% vs. 42.5% chance of losing. In addition to the cost of borrowing shares, they also need to cover for their own operating costs (cost of genius tends to be very high), and for the cost of capital on $30M to $45M. Bottom line: short sellers must believe that their odds of winning must be in the 65% to 70% range. Finance theory says it cannot happen in a fair and efficient capital market. Finance theory must be wrong! To explain short sellers' faith in such favorable odds, they need to either have lived in the future and come back to the present time with the Almanach of the Stock Market for 2021, or have inherited Mandrake-the-Magician's mind-bending skills, or are delusional/suicidal (but their investors typically are not) ... or they must believe they can play the system: that's basically securing access to superior information and/or having the ability to concentrate or consolidate purchasing power. I cannot explain BATMAN, but I like him, so I'll leave him in a special ""I'm always right"" box (that is the box for 100% winners).Any other interpretation?"

Buying into weakness. Placed buy order at $16 to replace the shares I sold yesterday. Not sure it will go down that low though today.
"Funny day, just gotta stick with a long term outlook and take advantage of the dips if you're still adding. This is a 100Bagger+ stock, so volatility like this is VERY much so expected and part of the pain towards the long term goal."

Naked short selling is not supposed to happen, it is tolerated at low levels, but that is very significant. I don't understand why the rules are left unchecked for this much and this long. Short selling is a good thing when it is done in compliance, this is nuts. How can the system be so silent and not doing its job at all at protecting the regular Joe and the underlying business from this rogue speculating?I am not well versed in SEC compliance matters: has anybody on this board any idea whether this kind of situation should lead to a petition at SEC level?"

"Assuming no big surprises either way on earnings, there's not much indication on which way stock price will go short term.I like the slow steady climb, but the volume is horrible. There's the saying ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" which may come into play after earnings if no surprises on upside or downside. I kinda see the ""short squeeze"" talk as the rumor part. I'm still hopeful for a squeeze, but instead of an exclamation point on price going up, volume is more like a whisper. Maybe may get more buyers that are hesitant and just want news company is still on track or waiting until they get closer to mass production. I'm still bullish long term. I have all the long term stock I want for now. I've unloaded some trading shares to reduce my risk going into earnings. I'll put some stops if price goes down to lock in gains before they become losses. If price goes up, I have a sell order at $20 and another lot TBD because if we hit $20 in next month or two, short squeeze should push it higher. Anyway, that's my game plan for both scenarios."
Very atypical of FUV to move on such a narrow band
Aaaand my sell order at $16 just triggered. Now putting a buy order for $15 in case price dips back down before earnings.Close above $16 would be great.
All this is is a buying opportunity.
"Waiting for shorts to say when is a good time to open a short position. I'll sell some of my trading shares if I agree that's a strong resistance area. Easy to call it after the fact.I don't mind anyone trading short or long side, we're all in the game to make money. At least back it up with some technical analysis or any somewhat detailed analysis. ""Too much competition"" is meaningless without details to back it up. You can say that for every single EV car out there LOL...question is which ones will fail or succeed and why."
"I'm still bullish on this company! It has legs. Just because it missed its production numbers for the quarter doesn't mean that it's time to get out. it's been quite a rough quarter for manufacturing as a whole due to various problems...i.e.: covid-19, supply chains. etc. I just bought more stock because I believe that this is a good EV product that is needed in all our cities and in dense population sites. Stay the course and you will be rewarded in the long run."
"No longs putting any selling pressure on this stock. New short estimates for today are showing 11,400,000+ shares short. All dips are purely artificial selling pressure. Shorts need to buy back their shares eventually! BUY N HOLD is all we can do I'm long and strong "
"Yes, a growth play no doubt. In this case EPS will get squeezed at the expense of growth and there will be some hiccups and setbacks along the way. And there will be a price to pay with the stock price adjusting. Look no further than FUV customer HYRE. HYRE is growing fast and announced record results with a top line beat, but a bad EPS miss and stock lost 1/2 it's value. I'm not saying that happens here but don't think investors only look at top line growth. If bottom line is not growing proportionally there needs to be a reckoning as the break even target is perceived to have changed and the stock needs to be valued accordingly. I think FUV sold off from being spooked by HYRE results."
"The daily trading pattern on this stock repeats itself almost everyday: a relatively quiet start, a push up, and then, around 10.30am-11.30am, a big price drop, not necessarily with large volume, followed an hour later-ish with partial price recovery, some wobbling post lunch time and a closing of the day that often is in the opposite direction of the start of the day (probably, day traders closing their start-of-the-day position). When volume is active, the peak effects seem amplified, but volume is unevenly distributed throughout the day. I'd like to call for your comments. Questions: (a) do you recognize some level of predictability in the daily trading patterns of FUV, and (b) if so, what insights could you share to explain such patterns? In particular, what does explain very large sudden swings in relatively low volume? synchronized trading across large players? effects of naked short selling? Also, can somebody explain if the costs of naked short selling are similar, more or less compared to covered short selling?"
Buying...
"I just paid attention to one more detail in last ER: as of 8/10, Mark Frohnmayer reported that short interest amounted to 7,310,000 shares, a noticeable drop by 2 mil shares since end of July."

Also, 63 vehicles in finished goods inventory, so some of those will be accounted for as sales in Q3. Odds are good that Q2 may have been the low point. Increasing pre-orders and down payments point to this."
no words for this debacle!

Thinking of going all in on Fuv. Currently hold 5700 shares @ 12 bucks . Thinking of upping my shares another 1000 if this puppy drops back to 12 or 11 or 10 & just hold it for 2 years! Feeling good about FUV!

Will be plenty of trading opportunities with a new trading range to be established. Also, will be an inevitable pull back from profit takers."
Nice new article on Forbes.
I started a Discussion on Wallstreetbetsnew to help get the word out about FUV. It is going to take more people to help get the word out about this great company.
"Any chance that FUV launches a petrol or diesel version? It could then compete with the tens of millions of rickshaws on the planet. That's a huge market and although FUV effectively is a fancy rickshaw, it is a hugely expensive one. It could be produced significantly cheaper with an ICE engine and then the company could target perhaps 5% of the world's rickshaw market."

Ah.... sorrry... No short-squeese 2day
Here are the facts. FUV did this a few weeks ago (sell off a few dollars) and came back even stronger. If you are holding it long term like I am then we will be back.
we can move 50%+ in one day. I am not shocked with this movement. long fuv!
sometimes insiders buy a very small amount of shares to show “support and strength “ today we saw true support. Buying 1.3 million shares OF REE by two insiders who already are dip inside with over 10%. This says a lot. I feel much more comfortable even more than what I was before. Love their tech truly the most unique EV play out there. Do your DD. $SOLO $FUV $LCID $FSR
"It's about growth, revenue up 167% from last year. And with supply chain issues. That is what to focus on."
Why today so bad? What is the news or rumor? I’m not really scared as I’ll be buy more but what’s the point for today’s crash?
omg hold till the factories done
Boom! Close above $18. Other caveat is the volume is still low. Really need volume to solidify move upwards. Lower volume increases chances of pullback from any rally or rally won't be as high.Earnings is coming up so all this tech analysis gets thrown out the window if any big positive or negative news.
What was Arcimoto’s delivery goal for 2021? Looks like they manufactured 74 units this quarter. Are we still on track for their goal?

"Put a sell order in for $17 now. If we breakout before earnings and get a nice squeeze, I will have a mental tentative sell target around $20 for my trading shares to sell about 1/2 of them. Will see if can run higher than that for the rest.My play for if don't break resistance at $17 before earnings is to continue to accumulate trading shares. Currently only have buy orders at $15 or lower. Will add buy order at $16 if my $17 sell order triggers."

"Time to start marching higher again. Very interesting trading day, the stock was hugging the $10.50 range like it was super glue"
10.3 million shares were short as of June 30!And then FUV became a threshold stock in early July (as they continued to short it naked)...Latest short borrow rate over 77%...
"For a a super small cap growth stock like FUV, we are holding up so well right now! Considering how insanely shorted this is, inflation fears, etc..., This stock is prepping for epic moves"
There is a pretty good video on YT about Arcimoto and the ATVM loan process. It a little long but goes step by step. I think we stand a good chance of getting at least 50% of AMP1 finances through this program. The doors are important!!
the market cap for fuv is so small that a few hedge funds can work together and easily manipulate the price. my guess is the current drop was to trigger stops losses so they could cover some shares they shorted. there is still a lot of shares left to cover so let's see where this goes.
Everytime I see one of these 3 legged contraptions around town I like to think about what would happen if my S Class blasted into it at 60 mph.....until everyone is driving one...I wouldn't be caught alive in one...
I've got this feeling we will see it shake down a few days prior to earnings. IMO I'm setting some $$ aside just in case. GLTA Peace C Go longs!!
"Haven't added in a while, but picked up a bit more at $16.09. Those shares are off the market for the next 10+ years now."
"Just so you guys know As the infrastructure plan currently stands.... All Arcimoto vehicles would likely have a 10% off consumer tax credit. On top of this, if Arcimoto sells their products for commercial use cases, the tax break is a 30% tax credit. So a $20,000 Arcimoto for example would cost $14,000 after ONLY federal tax credits are applied. Or if you buy a base model $18,000 FUV as a regular consumer the price drops to $16,200 after the 10% credit is applied."
And he can sing too...
has anyone else noticed that share count went up past 37 million from 35.8million from a week ago? Im pretty sure Arcimoto raised money during that 20% dip prior to earnings on that Friday. Im happy with this as they raised at ~$18ish. They should be sitting on $50Million+ cash after they report Q3 numbers.
I think Ross Gerber knows something we dont about arcimoto. Looks like platform 2 will also be able to be outfitted for local food delivery if you check his twitter. Very smart move from Arcimoto if this is true.
Bargain!!!! Load up to $24 soon!
"the last time we had a short squeeze we had 30 mil volume each day for 2 days, to me this is just algorithms or buying pressure from someone."
The chart looks like it’s shaping up a little.
Mini  pattern detected 
"$FUV is the only EV stock that has been green for most of day so far, while every other EV is deep redThis got to tell you something"
all you promoters. this company maybe makes 5M per year. and currently valued at 500M. that's ridiculous by any standard. this will fall back to 6 or 7 dollars min... ... there are so many competitive companies doing similar projects there is no way to justify that valuation. not even in 5 years. good luck. and yes I own shares long. just being realistic.
"focus long term and everything is fine. Focus on 24 hours and you're screwed. Good time to buy the dip again. I haven't added in about a month, Looks like I know what im doing tomorrow"
I said several week ago back down to $8. At the moment way over valued until the end of 2022 when the new Factory comes online. Long term an interesting bet.
"If this turns out to be from earnings, someone is going to be behind bars!!"
"Tomorrow is a big wild card play with the summer showcase event, I feel like few people know about this event imo. Ill be watching!"
"With all this short interest, Can you imagine the effect on the SP if they announce they have landed the ATVM loan? OMG!!"
"Didn't seem to post last several tries. Last try.FWIW, 50 day SMA bullish crossover of 100 day SMA. I think this is considered as a golden cross by some. Some use 50 crossover of 200 day SMA for that criteria.Would have been nicer to cross it today on up day on high volume like yesterday."
Let's see how tomorrow goes. I will be selling into strength at $17 if we hit that tomorrow. I think overall market rebound from drop earlier this week is due to subside and good chance those headwinds will affect FUV IMO.I'd expect traders to lock in profits before weekend with market so jittery so may have some selling pressure. I really would like FUV price to test mid to high 16's tomorrow or Monday. Volume wasn't very much day today on uptick so not feeling confident price movement up will hold.Guessing FUV trading next few days will be in upper Bollinger band for 20 day SMA which is around $14.5 and $16.5. Seeing if can doing some a trade or two before we either breakout of resistance or fall back into lower 20 day SMA Bollinger band.
"Feeling good, looking good, the future is bright!"

"Whoops, buy order I had at $17 got triggered. I forgot to cancel or lower it. Was planning on trying to do a quick trade before earnings. Hopefully earnings announcement will be after market closes and gives me a chance to sell. If not, no biggie. I'm not expecting anything bad from earnings. I just don't want to be holding too many trading shares for too long at any time to reduce risk."

Still very cheap. New Munro Live video on YouTube out this morning on Arcimoto!
They know this will be an easy walkdown with so many robinhooders and 700K revenue in a quarter on a 500 mil market cap..... Really? GME might have been a better buy
"FUV seems to become a ""contrarian"" stock, in particular vs. large caps. I am wondering if it is because it is a genuine growth stock with a huge long-term upside, contrary to large caps stocks whose growth is entirely priced in, or if it is because $13 to $14 a share really makes it a cheap stock in an overleveraged market. Or both."
"Arcimoto updated their stats, actually made 85 vehicles in Q2, vs the previously reported 74https://youtu.be/Tqtv-8X8czk"
EOD predictions?
"This drop was to be expected At the moment there are huge shortages of materials, electronics, watching company video's before earnings on the website they even mention it a couple times and are looking for alternatives like veryone elseLots companies look at the car dealers lots are almost empty, shortages will be going way into 2022 maybe longerI think it is a smart move from FUV to look for alternatives like rentals, it creates steady incomeThese units should be made beach ready and will be fun on the beach Better then a boring golf cartLet it settle and buy back in"
I heard about FUV the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
RUN ARCIMOTO!!!
Long term is all that matters
Any more rockets  being launched this week?
Eventually this is going to just break out and go for a multi hundred % run well past ATHs
Looks like strong support at 20 day SMA. Amazing how much price can get walked down on small volume especially after a big up day on high volume.Hopefully this is one last shakeout of loose hands before testing resistance.I'll likely set a buy order at $14 tonight just in case price is walked down further tomorrow.
lets just blow past $100+ to get rid of the shorts then focus on fundamentals again. WE HOLD!
Nice. Seeing more articles on FUV stock on how price has increased and how it's one of the most shorted stocks. Much better than those bogus law firm SPAM wires.
Showing a 59% borrowing fee right now for shorts. Im not too excited to see the short report from the end of June... But the short report from July 15th which will be visible to us at the end of July will be the fascinating one for sure. Buy N Hold
"It's the whims of the market makers and clearing houses... if this stock breaks into the 20s, they have to come up w/ millions of shares that they agreed to sell at lower prices (call options)... It's all about manipulation so they don't get burned by options... There are no day traders or funds selling this kind of volume (of FUV)... The price is being manipulated down out of the danger zone for next Friday... The hope is earnings will be disappointing enough that the price doesn't recover before Friday's expiration..."
ATVM loan application to be submitted within the next few weeks. 4-10 month process for approval.
This has to be giving shorts some serious pause. The video put out this week is amazing. A close today in the mid $16s could light the fire. And then there’s that ATVM loan approval possibility any time now.
*Yawn* More sideways trading in very tight range. I can't work with that for trading or pickup on shares on dips. Need it to breakout past $12 or dip closer to $10 again.

"Nice end today. Hopefully stock price can stay above the 20 day SMA support now. Volume was about same as yesterday, but shows bears aren't in control. I have sell order set at $16 if price moves up and buy orders in low $15's if price goes down to accumulate more."
".@WhiteHouse: Today @POTUS will sign an Executive Order that sets an ambitious new target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles."
"Oscar walked away today because Q2 cost of materials % (94%) scared him. OK, let's bring some historical perspective here: TSLA in 2010 (IPO year, 1st issue @ $17/share pre-split, $3.40/share post split equivalent):TSLA numbers for FY 2010:* Revenues: $117M* Gross Margin: 26.3% (was negative in 2008 and marginally positive in 2009. Since then, TSLA GP% fluctuated between 16.6% in 2019 and 30.2% in 2011: currently at 22%)* All non-material cash costs (mktg+selling, SG&A, OH, interest expense, etc.) = $174M (yep, 155% of Sales...)==> 2010 EBITDA: negative -$143M (-122% of Rev)TSLA 2010 Market cap (year end): $2.53Bn = share price of $5.33 (+57% appreciation in 6 months)TSLA EV= $2.98BnIncidentally, TSLA 2010 Net Debt: $450MValuation multiples: * let's forget EV/EBITDA... * EV/Revenues = 25.5 ... in 2010, i.e. by far not a ""crazy"" overvalued stock market.TSLA weekly production in the Fremont factory:* in 2012: started at 15 to 20 S cars/week in August; ramped up to 200 cars/week by November* in 2014: about 700 cars/week in January; about 1,000 cars/week by DecemberFremont annual production:* 2,500 cars in 2012, * about 20,000 cars in 2013, * about 47,600 cars in 2016 (the model 3 production started in 2018)Clearly, manufacturing process subject to tremendous learning effects. We all know it, but TSLA numbers suggest the extent to which this can happen. Let's imagine how a similar perspective would apply to FUV:* To generate $117M in sales, at ASP = $22k per vehicle, we need 5,320 vehicles produced annually. ==> TSLA had about 1,000 trained employees in Fremont in 2012 when they generated $413M in sales. I do not have the stats about TSLA labor force in 2010, probably around 300 to 500ish people?==> FUV: has doubled its workforce (200 staff) since last year (about 100 staff). ==> 5,320 vehicles/yr over 300 days of production/year and 2 shifts/day requires 9 vehicles/day/shift. Today, Arcimoto has proved it can do 4 to 5 vehicles/daily shift when the supply chain is working. To double shifts, they might need another 100-ish factory workers? That would lead to about 300 staff in total. Very achievable within the next 12 months.I say Arcimoto can reach this level of production by mid 2022 and reach that target of 5,230 FUV over 12 months by mid-2023. I'll speculate that they will reach an 80% cost of material at this scale of production, and that they will not spend more than $174M (ie about $45M per quarter) on all other cash costs (labor, advertising/promo, distribution costs, non-production supplies, cost of raising funds, cost of management, etc.). In this case, Arcimoto would achieve TSLA's 2010 EBITDA performance of -$143M (from July 2022 to June 2023).I don't see Arcimoto raise $450M in debt to finance 2022 and half of 2023, as TSLA did in 2010: Arcimoto's business model should be significantly less capital-intensive. Most of its financing needs will be to cover for operational losses: most likely natural way will be new equity raise, at least to a large degree. Losses and capital investment are likely to be funded with current cash until mid-2022, so they will need to raise about $200M by mid-2023: expect some dilution by 2023.Once Arcimoto reaches this $117M revenue targe, the future beyond 2023 is what one can imagine for Arcimoto's market footprint and brand potential. 50,000 PI-vehicles on one factory at ASP=$15k = $750M. Add PII cycles, and revenues could reach $850M on one production site. How it will translate in market cap and share price will largely depend on the speed at which the business will grow. If they get to $850M in 3 to 4 years after July 2023 (snail speed by TSLA standards, they did x20 in 4 years...), Arcimoto will be handsomely rewarded by the market, specially if the replicability of the Arcimoto model in other parts of the country and internationally becomes a credible perspective. In this case, I would not be surprised with an EV/Revenues multiple of 10 to 15: on $850M of revenues, that means, by 2026/2027, about $10Bn in market cap and a share price around $200 to $250: x20 vs today's stock price.That is what an EV play is all about: revolution in transport!"
Smarter weasel are slowly covering. 
"Batman is back out of the cave, definitely time to buy again. In March Batman said FUV will be at $5 and going bankrupt imminently. That didn’t age well at all… a shortie & distortie battle royale seems to being going on…"
"Calls for investigation, coordinated manipulation."
"Just checked out Lucid ""vaporware"" Motors stock and looks like a lot of the same law firms that went after Arcimoto not to long ago are after CCIV (ticker for Lucid Motors - went public via SPAC). Fricken stock chasers.If those law firms are going after companies without a good case (""in good faith""), they should be sued."
"Let's rub it in their(shorts and bats) face again, FUV was the only green EV stock This is the final countdown, and you know what is nextPeace out longs, enjoy the weekend"
Mornin Bulls! Excited for todays showcasing  !
"I think the next time we get this stock running again on any catalyst/momentum, there wont be any reversal like we've been having over the last few months. it's going to burst on this upcoming run"
tweet from Mark last night. BULLISHhttps://twitter.com/nardopolo/status/1432205199427264515
Short interest is at 47.6% with a Utilization of 98.3%. This thing could explode but the only thing holding it back is volume and public interest in this stock. word about this stock needs to be spread everywhere!
Nice dip right now for buyers!
"Going to start dipping my toes back in for trading shares starting Monday. Depending on how action goes today, I may start out with buy order at $10. Going to let price come to my strike price. Not gonna chase price this early. Sell off seems to have stabilized with emphasis on ""seems"".Will definitely save funds if somehow price gets back into single digits. If gets to $8 again, I'll back up truck."
"As always, everyone who gets to try a FUV, enjoys it massivelyhttps://mobile.twitter.com/DriveElectricTN/status/1433476077423366147"
nice end of day short seller attack. Buy with both hands at the close. Im adding a bit more again in the last minute of trading
Today is the day
Those shareholders selling at $13.90 need to be rushed to the ER. We could even use a rapid responder FUV to drive them...

"Looks like closing the gap from ~$14 to $12 will take some time. If sideways trading for a few more days, I think closing of gap will happen sooner. My guess is every week will have something in news to push overall market down. This means I think it's more likely $12 is current resistance and $10 is current support which is trading range I'm looking at for trading ops. This is very short term though at best. Not enough trading days since the ""great fall"" or ""great buying op"" or whatever one wants to call it to do any useful TA.Don't have any sell orders and keeping my $10 buy order for now."
Yahoo conversations working? I don't see anyone else posting today.
Slow march to close gap at $13.61.I will be selling some trading shares around that price. Will continue to sell at higher prices if stock continues going higher from there. Not selling any long term shares.
I have kept talking about how short selling gone unchecked is to be combatted. Looks like today what demo day.
yesterday aftermarket this hit below of $10 worst is yet tocome get what you can noworget alotloylesss then 10 soon bevderyvery afraid tolossalotlot moremoney
"To summarize the call, lower production than expected is entirely related to current issues with the supply chain, none of these issues being structural or longer-term, and lower EPS than expected is in part due to the share of production going to rentals rather than sales: i.e. a deliberate choice of increasing marketing investment to accelerate promotion of the brand and the products. My initial disappointment with Q2 numbers is eliminated: I see tactical choices made in the face of short-term issues and priorities, but the fundamental trajectory and company resolve remain intact."
"$FUV $SENS $Mara $NIO I am long on stock The daily trading pattern on this stock repeats itself almost everyday: a relatively quiet start, a push up, and then, around 10.30am-11.30am, a big price drop, not necessarily with large volume, followed an hour later-ish with partial price recovery, some wobbling post lunch time and a closing of the day that often is in the opposite direction of the start of the day (probably, day traders closing their start-of-the-day position). When volume is active, the peak effects seem amplified, but volume is unevenly distributed throughout the day. I'd like to call for your comments. Questions: (a) do you recognize some level of predictability in the daily trading patterns of FUV, sens, Mara, NIO and (b) if so, what insights could you share to explain such patterns? In particular, what does explain very large sudden swings in relatively low volume? synchronized trading across large players? effects of naked short selling? Also, can somebody explain if the costs of naked short selling are similar, more or less compared to covered short selling?I do covered call sell far out with small premium without loosing my share and pocket free money plus I bring my purchase price down. To almost zero in all the stocks I am holding in my portfolio. I do not buy stock if I am not willing to hold for 10 years."
tomorrow one option expired...they try to push down the price...buckle up guys...to the moon...tp 20$ end of this month...
