I've been buying RUN. It is a no brainer. Sales will continue to increase especially next year.
"RUN can never reach its full potential if we do not invest in national infrastructure, as this NYTimes article explains. It is amazing that half of congress is still bickering over a no-brainer proposal to upgrade our electric grid in ways that is necessary for the coming EV and solar expansion, not to mention the survival of our way of life and the planet. Meanwhile China is reaping the rewards of investing in high speed rail, deep sea ports, and investments in education and alt energy tech. Instead of doing anything about it we whine like babies that the world is unfair. Pitiful. Any politician that blocks national big vision investment now is sending us back decades. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/energy-environment/electric-grid-overload-solar-ev.html"
$77 by December
"Investopedia lists RUN as one of the three fastest growing alternative energy stocks. The 40% solar energy for USA by 2035 news 2 days back should have provided swift momentum to RUN. It did not last 2 days. But, today’s premarket action shows market seems to get it. RUN was only a few months back $100. I can’t see how it can’t go above it sooner than later"
Will buy in low 40’s
"This stock has been range-bound for months, but absent a snapback today it may have broken through its support. A little scary."
First things first. We need to get above the 100 day moving average at $47.40. Already nicely above the 50 day. Higher.
"Yeah, buddy!"
"Just watched my neighbor installing sunrun. Panel is LONGi and micro inverter is Solar Edge. Installers are all direct Sunrun employees. Finished the installation in 2 hours and beautifully. They said they are getting freaking busier, 60+ installation in my area just for this week. I am calling Sunrun for my own home."
"What's up with solar today? Sorry, in middle of work day, but watching my solar stocks pop. Was there news I missed?"
see you at $64.27 next week
ENPH great earnings. It’s gonna be our turn.. then we are at $70 for sure!
So I guess this is it. The bull run starts now!
Time to load up people. its might be the last time this stock falls below $50
U.S. trade officials delay decision on new solar tariffs
Climate bill could make this pop 20-30 percent quick
Solar panel prices are rising with supply chain issues. It's done nothing but go down since I bought in.
We need this 42 again if we gonna go up
"can you guys buy ISUN please, that company seems to be lost in the solar business"
any news about renewables today???
"Don't be greedy. If you are at all a trader, take some profits. Keep your core ... this will run again, but take some short-term sugar off the table. This is why you bought the dip at 43 or 41."
I'm getting sick of these shorts driving down the price as soon as the buy volume slows... Time for an Elon style tweet about having middle east investors lined up to take RUN private at $120 / share...
i like the $70 plus analysies .Whats wrong with this stock???
Expanding program with SPAN  big  moves. The rest is fodder
November 60+ 
Would love to see this back at $100!
"Three weeks ago, Needham initiates with buy and target price $75. JPM said RUN can soar 90%.Recent acquisition synergies, declining panel costs and infrastructure bills are all huge tailwinds. Company basically said they're firing on all cylinders and 2021 is growing 30% year over year.Do not give away your shares at discount prices.....big upside coming!"
Run is running good today. JPM target price is $80.
"We can't have electric autos and ever increasing electric appliances, and expect the existing grid to deliver the necessary energy to each household to support this load. Rooftop solar eliminates the need for massive land requisition and transmission infrastructure, and minimizes the distance between the point of generation and the point of use. An electrified future depends on local power generation. That's why Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Truist, Barclays, RBC, Needham, CS, etc. have all these analysts pushing a buy so strongly. Sunrun is not just a panel installer, they are setting up contracts as both a solar utility (but not needing to buy the land and transmission infrastructure to support it) as well as a finance company with a nice spread. Financials show that the customer acquisition costs are front loaded, thus the current quarter performance hits. Listen to ALL of the analysts on this one - it is a massive value accumulation and the price is displaced by a combination of short manipulation and uninformed retail investors. BUY BUY BUY"
should run up to 56ish. if it break the 56 cieling should run up low 60's
"Sunrun pushes higher after BMO Capital initiates overage with Outperform ratings and a $65 price target, forecasting a multiyear boom in U.S. residential solar in the U.S.Noting that Sunrun is the largest U.S. residential solar provider, BMO's Ameet Thakkar says the company continues to drive down its cost of capital, which could results in more free cash flow to equity."
Morning ladies.
"RUN initiated with a BUY at Needham. Target $75Needham analyst Vik Bagri initiated coverage of Sunrun with a Buy rating and $75 price target. Sunrun is ""the leader in the crowded U.S. residential solar industry"" with about 15% share, which Bagri identifies as almost twice that of its closest competitor. He thinks the industry can keep growing at a fast pace due to EV adoption and sees the shares trading ""at a compelling entry point"" with Sunrun down over 50% from its high."
How many of you installed Solar Panels?... If you did not than stay away from this looooser.
thoughts on next Q any chance for a positive EPS
Sunrun is up 7.61% to 56.58
Any one thinks this is the run we waiting for ? Specially earning soon and run usually goes up before
This is just for the long run. Two yearsfrom now we will profit a lot
"Guys, question, do you really think, they will have a good earnings report?"
"Had to sell back in soon, this will be in 60’s in late November"
