"Any thoughts on what ETFs might include Sprott? Certainly the small cap ETFs would get on it. Maybe some financial ETFs like PSCF, or alternative ETFs would include it."

Basel III and Gold...A fabulous read you will all enjoy.The long awaited bull run in precious metals may have just started. This could get very interesting..... https://www.usgoldbureau.com/news/basel-iii-and-gold
The main reason for this jump in price was the super sales pitch in the Dan Ferris newsletter.
"Here’s a re-cap of what I believe will occur in coming days. SII.TO IPO’d PHYS.TO and MNT.TO in 2010, raising the capital and managing the funds. They also provided the gold through gold off-take from a mining prospect.The Internal Capital Reorganization1. The arrangement of amalgamating related parties to unlock capital surplus accumulated over years is called an internal capital reorganization. 2. The capital surplus was termed ‘appreciation of assets under management’ in Q2.3. The capital surplus has been moved onto the balance sheet with the Q2 report, but the at-market capital raise of the physical precious metals trust completes the stated Q2 capital surplus.($3.2b. U.S.)4. In order that the capital surplus not be counted as revenue and subject to taxation, it must be matched dollar for dollar with either an acquisition cost or accumulated deficit. (Probably in the form of financing)5. The paid-up capital of the emerged amalgamated corporation is the same or less than sum of the paid-up capital of the issued shares of the predecessor corporations. Meaning shares of greatly varying value can be amalgamated. The value would be in the capital surplus.(This is not a merger or buyout)“Moreover, on an amalgamation of two or more taxable Canadian corporations, subsection 87(3) of the Income Tax Act ensures that the paid-up capital of the issued shares of the new corporation do not exceed the paid-up capital of the issued shares of its predecessors, immediately before the amalgamation.”https://www.mondaq.com/canada/income-tax/981872/corporate-amalgamation6. The amalgamation can be concluded with an effective date that is not the end of fiscal year. 7. The amalgamation, or plan of arrangement will be a two-step process. First, the mining prospect must be acquired by the special purpose vehicle for one share plus one warrant, and a bowl of blue smarties.8. The special purpose vehicle thus created carrying the mining prospect(accumulated deficit & financing) and the gold off-take(block-caving financing) is amalgamated in an horizontal amalgamation with the parent. That means the sum total of shares of the special purpose vehicle become shares in the parent. 9. Once an effective date is announced, this concludes the internal capital reorganization of SII.TO10. With available cash on hand, retail investors can scoop up the equity in related parties for windfall gains. The entry point is SRHI.TO(SRHIF) and SRHI.WT Recommended that any shares of related parties be placed in a tax-shelter."

PSLV AND PHYS DOWN how does.this go up and I dont see any earnings per EPS? but it pays a dividend .. I am in pslv. thanks
SII.TO reached a 52 Week high at 3.58
SII.TO is up 5.27% to 43.31
Why did it drop so much after market open?
"i'm thinking they need to show earnings of $45m. CAD for the quarter, in order to get the share price up to $70CAD where they unlock capital surplus for acquisitions and close their internal capital reorganization."
What does this rising mean? Economy wise. Or at least beliefs on the economy
Any inisght on this ongoing weakness with SII? Very disappointing despite solid fundamentals

"Called SPROTT today for when Q3 results will come out... they said the announcement for that will be this Friday and their results will be available on 11/13/2020. What if gold gets to $2,500 by June 2021? That should bode well for SPROTT... ehhh?"
Sprott is down 4.99% to 39.57
SII.TO is up 4.98% to 38.12
"There is a wilful argument that no capital surplus exists and could not possibly exist, because the amount of surplus revenue that would require simply could not come out of operations. Fair enough. Let’s rule that notion out completely. Irrespective of whether SII.TO could accumulate capital through its own revenue or not, there have been historic capital raises and capital accumulation through related parties. The capital raised from the IPO of PHYS.TO and MNT.TO amounts to $1b. U.S. and the capital accumulation from 6-7 years of production of GBRIF would be $700m. U.S., which amounts to $1.7b. U.S. This capital remains unused, held at Sprott Private Lending, which was amalgamated with the parent.The recently announced at-market capitalization of $1.5b. U.S. PHYS.TO added to capital raised amounts to $3.2b. U.S., equal to the increase of assets under management with the Q2 report. I presume that $2.2b. U.S. will go to underground development of Minera Tres Valles, while $1b. U.S. will go to financing development of The Laronge Gold Belt. Both related parties $SRHI(MTV) and $GBRIF(Laronge) will be brought in-house through an horizontal amalgamation. This process is called an internal capital reorganization.The entry points to this internal capital reorganization are SRHI.TO (SRHIF) or SRHI.WT"

"Hi LauraFirst time poster here. Just got my user ID and password set up recently. Look forward to posting now and forward to share my opinions. Yes I agree with you. Better to just buy Sprott Inc and ride it up during the next few years as this bull market in precious metals continues to move up. Have owned Sprott Inc over the last 5-7 years and most of my purchases were in the $2.50. Average cost today is $2.70(pre 10:1 split) or $27.50 post split. I have waited all this time because I knew sooner or later this bull market would get going. I saw a huge run up in profits after the recent NYSE listing. Profits were around $120k at peak $57 SP recently. Have given back around $50k in profits on the recent drop in price from the peak. It doesn’t bother me as this is a “buy and hold” over the next few years. With all the money printing and stimulus seen so far and much more to come, we will easily reach and exceed the $57 SP recent highs. Precious metals miners will have more upside however the royalty companies are safer and will also enjoy the ride up. An asset management company like Sprott us a very safe bet to me too.Francis I like your posts on this board too. I loved your analysis on Sprotts $3.2b of surplus Capital they had to work with you mentioned a few times. Can you perhaps elaborate on what the potential opportunities that would do to the Share price here if the maximize those opportunities you provided? Curious to know what our upside here is in price not just for that surplus but also if we get a $2,500 or higher gold price as many are expectingThxRon"
interesting company
Does anyone know the financial health of this company.?
I have considered just copying everything sprott does and buying into as many stocks as I can that he personally owns. Thoughts?
anyone care to theorize on the 20%+ price drop since the beginning of June?
"Oh, and it pays a 4% dividend... :-)"
"My opinion is that the big sell off was profit taking by the new money that flowed in recently. The run up does not help long term investors who are holding for much higher prices down the road. SII on the TSX (in Canadian $s) and SPOXD (In US $s) are tracking well and their prices are equivalent, when you figure in the exchange rate."
"While I was expecting a significant increase in earnings, we are finally seeing the size of the capital surplus, which is a little larger than I expected. $3.2b. U.S. in cash meant to be deployed on acquisitions, such as a mining prospect, a gold off-take, and a mining portfolio."

Question how many shares equals 1 oz of gold?
"I’m ready to dump any notion that there’s an undeclared capital surplus of $3.2b. U.S., and instead proceed with the facts on the Q3 report: My impression about the conference call is that respondents are obliged to closely examine the minutiae on the quarterly statement, since the P/E ratio is extraordinarily high. How on earth will the stock price go up, with the P/E ratio so high? But then you compare with other royalty companies in the space, the ratio is nearly the same.Everything seems in order, the stock price will go up as the gold price goes up.The question to ask, really, is how is the company expected to grow? The company expects to grow net sales and net inflows(this is the first time looking at their MD&A). There are only very few instances of net sales and net inflows using a page search through the Q3 MD&A.I’m very reluctant to continue speculating and more strongly desirous of dealing in facts. This time around. The one fact I do know is that the accumulated deficit at $GBRIF has to be in the $850m. U.S. range. Another fact that I do know is that on amalgamation, the assets and liabilities of the target become the assets and liabilities of the parent.The one fact I don’t really know is the cost per ounce associated with extracting so many ounces(the total ounces is unclear) from the La Ronge Gold Project.If the accumulated deficit strictly matches the capital held in Private Lending LP, then the amounts in the private lending LP being commensurate with this figure would mean that the total number of ounces delivered to precious metals trusts would have a per ounce cost below $300 U.S.This substantially changes my assumptions that the cost associated with gold produced from $GBRIF is $1000/oz. U.S. As concerns this balance sheet, those assumptions of $1000/oz. U.S. are plainly wrong.The capital surplus held within the Private Lending LP IS commensurate with a modified expectation of a lower cost quartile assumption, but this changes my expectations as to the amounts held in the Private Lending LP, or - capital surplus - There is a variance between the $ CAD and $ U.S. so the cost quartile of the mining prospect in $ CAD would vary significantly with a $U.S. figure over several fiscal years.If you go back further in prior fiscal years, amounts held under Private Lending LPs fall under Alternative Investment Strategies, where the actual figure associated with providing doré to physical precious metals trusts becomes obscured.There is a seriously huge net sales and net inflow from the $PHYS at-the-market capital raise, which, once fully subscribed, goes under Private Lending LP.After tossing out my previous assumptions of a huge, unreported capital surplus, the amounts held under Private Lending LPs and the recent at-the-market capital raise would suffice for an amalgamation of $SRHI with the parent once $SRHI acquires control of $GBRIF and a gold off-take from Minera Très Valles is agreed upon.The amounts in question are $900 m U.S. to go to financing development at the La Ronge Gold Project, and $1.5b. U.S. from the at-market capital raise of $PHYS goes to purchasing a gold off-take from MTV. Probably all under the guise of financing.The completion of this whole strategy is called an Internal Capital Reorganization.The growth in question to come will be achieved by concluding the internal capital reorganization in the very near term, and the longer term acquisitions and possible future net inflows from more IPOs or at-the-market issuances. This does not rule out providing financing to mining prospects in the future.There ‘s a very bright future in store based on growth in the business."

"Check out that sweet 5 year chart, go to 52 relatively soon "
We’re at a 30-day volume weighted average price of $38U.S. or $50CAD. This fulfills the requirement that the market value is determined before any form of merger or amalgamation take place. Both the SEC rules and securities laws in Canada are satisfied. A mismatch occurred between the stated increase in AUM and market activity in Q2. What that means is a major development is set to occur.

"The basic foundation of the Sprott business is allocating gold to the mint. The capital raise is done by the ETF. The gold is supplied by offtake from a mining prospect. The advantage Sprott has in the gold space is that they need not rely on futures or spot and wait many years for delivery from markets at market prices to acquire physical, and can obtain unrefined gold at cost, far below market. This is their special sauce. They obtain a huge competitive advantage with this business strategy. Next, they will proceed to bring in-house a gold mining prospect. Growth will come by selling this prospect to a mining company."

"Mostly ppl believe that Sprott, inc. purchases their precious metals from the futures market. They never specifically and unequivocally stated this. But I have. a solution how they may have obtained precious metals during the years-long trough from investors anxious to sell, or perhaps any time there’s a correction in precious metals prices.CanLii- It might interest investors to read the sub-custodial agreement obtained by Sprott, inc. in 2012. Sprott, inc. would have arranged to obtain those precious metals for sale around the world and taken delivery of bullion products during the price correction for several years. Subsequent to this, Sprott, inc. is in development to conclude an internal capital reorganization that would prepay for offtake from mines by capitalizing their development, as these prospects are very similar and have a history over decades of not being able to raise capital in prior cycles. The monies come out of capital surplus raised in the last year at the physical precious metals trusts in the amount of $5.3b. U.S. https://bit.ly/3jG4VXd $SII $PSLV $PHYS $TVC $GBRIF"

Seems like the run up was more than Dan Ferris and The Extreme Value newsletter(which I do receive) this has been touted for quite some time before the run up. Any idea of the real reason for the run up? Cheers all
"The earnings date comes early, right after options expiry. Earnings will establish the company value. But something new will enter the picture, perhaps after earnings. Both physical precious metals trusts(gold/silver) are raising capital to the tune of $2.7b. U.S. SII.TO will then be amalgamating with related parties to unlock this capital in an internal capital reorganization."
why the bump today?
any idea on the current state of assets inflows to Sprott?

"I'm hanging in there for 1 year... great divi, but yeah... of course, price action would be nice too! Looking very much forward to probably another company record setting earnings report... which I think is March 1st."

How eminent is the NYSE listing?
"I would say that ‘The Santa Clause’ business model, where ppl literally believe that billions are being spent in the futures market supplying precious metals trusts so that holders of SII.TO can be paid a dividend, is at risk.The way this company works would be they are the principal in raising the capital at the precious metals trusts, where the capital is then used to pre-pay for unrefined precious metals in doré or concentrate by financing a mining prospect, and then delivered to the Royal Canadian Mint for refinement who produces the good delivery bars. The allocation to the physical precious metals trust is then concluded by changing rooms in the vault. SII.TO gains a huge competitive advantage over the competition by obtaining the precious metals in unrefined form far below cost.There are virtually NO futures market transactions to acquire their precious metals for the precious metals trusts, as they obtain unrefined offtake from mines. Their futures markets transaction may take place when shares are redeemed in the trusts when someone wishes to take delivery.But this means that SII.TO requires an internal capital reorganization to UNLOCK the capital raised. (the capital raised by the precious metals trust in Q4 2020 was reported only in the end of fiscal year annual financial reports, Mar. 22)"
