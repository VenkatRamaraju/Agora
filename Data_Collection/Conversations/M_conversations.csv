Macy is already making more sales before COIVD 19... Its transformation makes it better.It is not just a recovery play. It is a growth company....
"still massively undervalued here folks, especially after Q2 earnings, dividend , share buybacks and raised guidance. Delta shall pass as did the much worse part of covid did last year."
"I'm a bull and am sitting on 9k shares but would someone please tell pumpers like osulinnn to relax and quit spamming this board. We get it. You like the stock too. Just quit making 50 posts a day about it. Also, whoever these spammers are trying to get people to hit their link for Discord(whatever that scam is) need to be banned."

Take us down all you like. $3.60 this year plus the lush dividend will send us over $30 soon enough!
"if they say $27 that means its going to move $37-40 Just imagine amount of toys Macy's going to be selling toward to Christmas. Also they have started giving out dividends back to investors. Yep, They will be taking away toys business from Walmart, Target, Amazon and more. Yep, win win win for Macy's."
"Macy's online store is excellent, easy returns at the store or by mail."
"I wrote previously that I had a Strong Premonition about Macy and that they would declare a dividend. Everything came true. I believe, I said a price of 25. Now hearing the earnings. Sky maybe the limit... Macy is not going to let Amazon and Walmart get away from them. Women love Macy. I know that for fact! Also, I like the Men's department. Quality Clothes Line."
Great News on its way!!!Blow-out earnings and FORWARD Guidance looking better than ever. Small foot print stores ramping up and online sales steady increased
If I buy now can I get the $0.15 per share dividend? I like this company as it has great potential. Expect surge in sales especially during Christmas…
"Macy’s (ticker: M) reported an adjusted profit of $1.29 a share during the fiscal second quarter, far ahead of expectations for 23 cents a share, according to FactSet. Sales of $5.65 billion, up 59% year-over-year, also beat estimates for $5.01 billion. Same-store-sales jumped 61.2%, crushing forecasts for 41.2% growth."
"Let me give you facts. I started in 1995. I closed last night, and the many racks of new receipts were being brought onto the floors. The store is being stocked for the upcoming fall season. There is a lot of stock coming in. Two points, lot of stock coming which will aggressively stock the store for a strong buying trend, and two, THIS IS THE VERY SIGNIFICANT POINT, we are in August, and that is usually a ghost town period, a time when in the past, there was reduced business activity, and we are busy nonstop. If August is busy, there will probably be an even busier fall, and with Christmas being the period where shopping trends are at the peak for the year, this year is going to be explosive, especially if the COVID trends become controlled and reduced. This time is the time to be forward looking rather than cautious. Yeah, don't know the price points to come, but the stock trend is upward for the future, very strongly upward for the future."
Bad day in stock market and M could reach $20.00s. Then bounce around $20.00-$24/25.
No reason for us to be under $30 other than real investors have left the station. The street is now a macro animal addicted to day trading ETFs. Buy.
"In early February, I wrote why M was undervalued at $15. At the time, I said in the long run M was worth $30-40/share. With the current closing price at $22.46/share, I still believe this expectation is achievable with the $40/share target more probable.M’s management has come out of the COVID crisis achieving some amazing results. Over the last five quarterly releases, they have beaten analysts’ expectations by $0.96, $0.60, $0.69, $0.78 and $1.06/share sequentially in each quarter. How can analysts be so far off the mark on this company? They currently have 7 underweight/sells on the stock versus one buy from an analyst at OTC Global. Kind of reminds me of late last year where every analyst was bearish on GME before it took off. Management has already spoon fed analysts that earnings will be $3.41-3.75/share range for FY22 with their recently raised guidance. However, I would not be surprised if they beat that in the upcoming two quarters with monster “back to school” sales in Q3 and huge Q4 holiday sales. Back in early February, analyst were expecting M to only make $0.65/share on average this year, but now the average expectation is $3.68/share, but the stock has only moved up $7.50/share on an additional $3/share in earnings. Can you say “Undervalued”? I contend analysts are maintaining negative outlooks on the stock because a large number of their clients are still short M (36M short as of mid-August). It could present a lush target for retail investors to expose to a squeeze as almost 90% of the float is held by institutional investors and insiders.Over the past three quarters, M has dramatically improved their financial position. They finished the current quarter with $2.1B in cash and $3.3B in long term debt while projecting EBITDA this year of at least $2.6B. Earlier this month they used $1.3B of that cash to buy back debt coming due in 2025 (8.375% interest rate) which will save over $100M interest costs per year and add $0.25 to earnings next year. The remaining debt level results in a net LTD debt/EBITDA of <1. M certainly is not a company that is in financial destress and I would expect the ratings agency to upgrade M later this year. Also, realize that the real estate they own is still worth more than the current market cap of $7B, which adds an additional margin of safety to owning M.With the improved financial position, management was able to reinstate a $0.60/share annual dividend which amounts to a 2.7% yield. They also authorized a $500M buyback program which will allow them to use their strong cash flow to buy back shares. At the current price, they could buy back 22M shares or 7% of the float. So with the dividend and the buyback if executed in the next year, that would equate to almost a 10% return to shareholders which is nice.I still contend M is undervalued when compared to its competitors. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.33 compared with Kohl’s (0.49) or Dillard’s (0.78). One could argue their share price should be selling for between $34-53/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their stronger e-Commerce business which made up 32% of sales in the most recent quarter growing 44% above 2019 Q2 results. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 3.9 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.58), #8 Target (1.25) and #9 Costco (1.07). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $39-85/share. I will stick with my contention that M worth a lot more than $22.46/share. With me now getting paid a solid dividend, I can wait for Mr. Market to realize that M is undervalued. I expect that I will be able to sell my shares for more than $40/share in the next year. I am long M and still buying at these levels."
The collapse of Afghanistan at this time may have little to no impact on Market. Longer term it will be devastating for the entire world. The families that lost loved ones and that were injured my heart goes out to you. To all traders Goodluck in your trading.
How come DDS never get the same hype has M do? They reported better earnings and their Balance sheet is far superior. Dillard’s dominates the South and Midwest.
With reinstating the dividend It replaced my salary and M just allowed me to retire and live off only the dividend. Never selling a single share!
"Return of dividend! increase in rev over 2019, increase of profits in a big way over 2019! Pay down on Debt! This is the straight flush of earnings reports!"
Buy. The 18% short actor(s) is now dizzy from the $3.60 eps estimated. It points towards another $10-$15 upside.
