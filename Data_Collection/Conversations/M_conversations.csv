"I wrote previously that I had a Strong Premonition about Macy and that they would declare a dividend. Everything came true. I believe, I said a price of 25. Now hearing the earnings. Sky maybe the limit... Macy is not going to let Amazon and Walmart get away from them. Women love Macy. I know that for fact! Also, I like the Men's department. Quality Clothes Line."
No reason for us to be under $30 other than real investors have left the station. The street is now a macro animal addicted to day trading ETFs. Buy.
Not even a holiday season yet.... WOW... that is something...
"Analysts will raise price to 50 after this great report.. and yes, it is not a holiday season yet.."
"What say you, now, M haters? You will now have to directly give us longs $6.3 in dividend payments. $80 an M share, here we come! Keep on losing, shorts!"
nice. Bringing back that divi
Brokerages holding us back to allow shorts to cover. Buy.
M should be 50 like KR.. the one that AMMN didn't kill. WMT and TGT and so on.AAPL didn't kill GRMN.. GRMN is traded at 190
I once flooded a Macy's because I made big doughdo and lots of tissue used.
"This year's parade is online, too, for the Macy's brand! Save money!"
Shorts better cover soon..
So wait a minute... their profit was over a quarter of a billion?
$22.19 is the highest you'll see it for a very long time.
Made 1$ per share...Sales growth 60%.. That is as good as nVDA...$200
To $30+ tomorrow!
Put puts on mvst going to the grave yard tomorrow
"Macy’s ON SALE TODAY- thanks to NORDIES “leading indicator” report… very cautiously optimistic… watching for signs that dementia joe’s handlers’ policies start taking hold- and driving aggregate economy down, down, DOWN-"
Just wait until the bandwagon comes they are usually late to the party! This party is only on day one and all the experts are now showcasing M more people will digest the Grand Slam earnings and buy!!
yes. M will follow SIG and GRMN...
"$3.60 estimated this year will drag M over $25 soon, then $30. The Covid reinvented us into a powerhouse."
dip buys at 16 paying off today
I just put in an online order at Macy's to be delivered.
M will hit 30 very quick.. keep adding..
"Oops, sold last year. What a mistake."
Market cap today M - $7.1 BTJX - $91.2 BGranted TJX has about double the sales of M.....but 12x difference in market cap? Both have some cash and debt (albeit M has more debt).
Macys has 2.1Billion cash. Positive Income. Cashflow. Outlook is good. I would have not rushed into giving dividend. Reinvest in the business. I would have opened more smaller stores and even opened target like stores with a couple of coolers in the back with milk and orange juice grocery. That is how they stay open regardless of what happens in the future.
Wait until holiday season... OMG..... this is shocking...
Did I tell you people ?
"Macy’s is an American institution. It has great products and great prices with excellent customer service and a terrific return policy especially for online orders. They give back to the community: think Fourth of July fireworks and Thanksgiving parades et al.Go, Macy’s!!"
Goodluck all longs. Great job M mgmt. Hope you can do same next quarter. If your long keep the faith but you might take a few coins off the table. Delta lockdown is coming there is no choice. The deep state globalist are in charge and there not done yet.
Imagine if this goes up like DDS did. Wouldn't that be nice lol
So that news about early redemption of senior notes... that's good right?

AMZN loss is Macy's gains
when you have comparison of M and JWN...You know M is on the right tract and makes a lot of right move..
AMZN opening two department stores. Could they potentially buy M like Robert has been saying all along? Isn’t that how the Whole Foods acquisition played out?
$30 next week.
Nice pop. Congrats.
This most be the most undervalued retail company in the world.500 million at 20 usd avg = 25 million shares less based on 250 million shares outstanding = 10% buyback!!!This will give serious support in the coming months!!! Very very bulish !!!!Kurt
"Upside galore. Given M's increased and effective online prowess, it warrants at least a 10 multiple putting it at $36. Buy."
TJX $75.. I think Macy should be worth at least that amount..
"If M was smart, after blowing away estimates next week, they should reinstate the full dividend. Buy."
"We are going to $30 by Friday. Forget about covid, supply chain issues, labor issues, stimi, Fed malls will never die just loving some M. Maybe $40 by next week lots of grey hairs leaving nursing homes to do some shopping."
"Macy got smart. First of all the Ladies Love Macy's, because they sell quality stuff. Amazon is a meat and potato store. Macy's does online sales plus brick and mortar sales. I really think (M) will me a bigger winner. My humble opinion..."
"Deutsche Bank increases Macy's Target price from $24 to $27, Nice, Sweet!"
"Macy's Strategy1. To sell Switch, ps5, Oculus and traditional toys at Toys ""R"" Us.2. To eliminate high yield debt as it tapers.3. To take care of LGBT, not to parade in Corona disaster and not to ruin reputation.4. Reduce the number of executives.5. Put electric car chargers in suburban parking lots."
60% growth. Beat and raise the guidance..Same PE at TJX ===> 150
if yahoo deleted my comment about creative accounting tricks in Macy's about selling 1.3 billion and repaying 1.3 billion bonds in two months I think I hit the nerve.
Crazy we're trading under $30 with $3.60 estimated this year. Who's fooling whom?
This company will be bankrupt in 3 years.
"$AMZN should buy $M, it will bring $AMZN significant revenue growth for little cost."
people on here calling for cmg PE have no clue how to trade this stock. if you know anything about this stock is that it ALWAYS gives back the pop.
"Christmas trade upcoming. With $3.60 estimated, we could easily crack open $4. We'll be trading over $30 near term. Any questions?"
Macy’s debt now lower than pre-COVID. I bet divy is coming.
"Macy’s blew away the earnings expectations and unlike so many of its competitors they successfully survive, and transitioned from brick & mortar to online and survived COVID. Huge for Macy’s. Congratulations to Macy’s. JC Pennys, Sears all out of business, but Macy’s not only survived they crushed earnings. This is in,y going higher, jump in. Jump on board now before liftoff"
"Thankfully I stayed strong bought at 6.50, sitting on 4500 shares... only have 150 of Kohls :( .... I've done well with Macy's , unfortunately, It's making up for my stupidity in the COVID vaccine stock that I bet the farm on.. :) TY Macy's"
$100 here it comes
loaded up some more 16.63
This is not even holiday season... $100 is possible.
$6 price average
Macy has real store (and improved one) also internet sales.. It is different now.
"Now watch, after beating it up forever, Cramer will be touting M tonight!"
$25 today?
"PE of 25, 100"
buy buy buy just read an article and the analyst said macys is treading water at best.could you imagine saying something like that publicly
"As a long time holder of Macys share, let's take a moment and congratulate management and employees for their work resulting in the best quarter in years. I will make a short term prediction. There are a number of analysts working for Wall Street firms, you probably already know their names, that hate Macys. These people are going to come out in the next few weeks with comments aimed at diminishing the spectacular results or the company, and ultimately drive down the price of the stock. Their criticism will probably be based on vague worded industry trends, Amazon!, their personal feelings or to conflate some meaningless number in the quarterly report into an horrible dark shadow for the future of the company. Don't buy the garbage they are selling."
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Ports closed in China, Covid on the rise,Inflation on the rise, we are going higher, going to be epic."
Buy. The 18% short actor(s) is now dizzy from the $3.60 eps estimated. It points towards another $10-$15 upside.
Macy's just broke its chains. Look for it to jump into the mid $20's near term.
sell rating out PT 18.. issued at 1:55PM by CFRA
People busy with HOOD.
"crazy volume today shorts still want to battle with bulls after blowout earnings, stock buybacks, and toysrus resurrection. $30 by end of the month"
Shocking that so many analysts following Macy's could be so off on their estimates. They should each be demoted in their organizations.
buy buy buy. not too many sellers with earnings next week a big squeeze is comming with 40000000 short
This should dip back down to 19 today based off the chart.
I buy all my laced thongs from Macy’s
How come DDS never get the same hype has M do? They reported better earnings and their Balance sheet is far superior. Dillard’s dominates the South and Midwest.
Old trading range was around $15 to $20 Maybe new trading range will be $20-$25. This stock is fully priced for now.

Apparently M is eating JWN lunch or someone else..Green by end of day.
… Next step $25. Enjoy the ride 
"Return of dividend! increase in rev over 2019, increase of profits in a big way over 2019! Pay down on Debt! This is the straight flush of earnings reports!"
"Easy $1K made in 10 minutes trading Puts. Enjoy worrying if this is gonna hold, ladies! I could have made alot more but not greedy like you all."
That sales and profit is better than AMD... Imagine M is traded at 120B..
Bad day in stock market and M could reach $20.00s. Then bounce around $20.00-$24/25.
Good point to short
Is it true that toys r us will be using Macy’s stores for sales?
Wall Street beholden banks to the shorts doing their best to keep them afloat. They will fail. Buy.
Macy is already making more sales before COIVD 19... Its transformation makes it better.It is not just a recovery play. It is a growth company....
"based on all the metric comparing M to target..M should be traded at 100. because of smaller cap,, I see 150.."
"Macy moving in right direction North brook Illinois store converted to a hotel. Store on Mag Mile closed, was only busy during certain “events”. Any chance company could be split between a REIT for its massive real estate held?"
Macy is not a MeMe stock yet.. But we missed the internet part of business.$150..
"Quick earning in a few hours,ride the train LOTE and be really happy you got in this low."
$1.29 vs .18 expected? $40 stock comes into view. Buy.
"$25 is imminent, enjoy the ride home "
keep buying.. M will be 150..
Sale growth up 60% better than AMZN..wow.
Went long @19 this morning...think it could easily double from here !
"Will end day Around $20 even, and that is being generous."
Welfare checks revving and filling up our stores. Going to be a Merry Christmas!
M has successfully fused brick and mortar with online. It has done in apparel what AMZN could only imagine doing. Buy.
Seems like Earnings estimates for M have been revised upward the last 90 days.
"I just think that in the near future, Macy will be a big winner. Just a premonition..."
"SIG is a very similar example of what is happening to M. Huge short interest, great fundamentals, and eventually stock rocketed. Check out their five year chart."
wallstreetbets here
"M now projecting $3.60 for the year lol. Not sure the short position here, but fundamentally it is trapped. Buy."
Macy's adding Toy's are Us to their 400 hundreds stores will boost their earning. $30-40 coming very soon.
sque ze !!
Back to 20 on Monday
"Im sorry but i have to laugh. Yes what an Icon, shopped their along with all my family members. Remember Sears, Kmart, Gimbals JC Penney Albertsons. Maybe it survives a bit longer but I am amazed its being compared to Amazon or Walmart. not even close and you will unfortunate see in time. Vintage is great concept but will never hold over time. Sad but true"
30s yea right. in whose life time? Sorry you can rebrand this dinosaur but its the same ole Macey's. They tried it at Sears a few times. Now graveyard material. So much more popular and updated styles out there.
"Macy’s (ticker: M) reported an adjusted profit of $1.29 a share during the fiscal second quarter, far ahead of expectations for 23 cents a share, according to FactSet. Sales of $5.65 billion, up 59% year-over-year, also beat estimates for $5.01 billion. Same-store-sales jumped 61.2%, crushing forecasts for 41.2% growth."
I am pretty sure M should be higher that AMC market cap.. LMAO..
MARKET MAKER cannot handle shorts trying to cover. Macy’s leg up to 23
JWN a gift to covering shorts. Window will close shortly. Buy.
"You'd be a fool to sell after today's earnings crush, dividends and buyback announcement.. M is going to 30 before Christmas."
"Like i was saying as risk goes down, value goes up. Waiting for earnings release and see what's the cashflow. If they manage to have a cashflow of 800 to 900 millions before interest, then we can see prices over 20 ."
Very appealing to shorts right now. Later in the day.... Take profits before you lose them!
Watching the the TV and this laser focus im so relieved.
$20 has come for us once again.
If I buy now can I get the $0.15 per share dividend? I like this company as it has great potential. Expect surge in sales especially during Christmas…
nice to see follow-thru today after the 20% short-squeeze yesterday. This breakout is for real.
I see almost impossible to stop Short squeeze

"Time to Short it, already too high for the day"
Macy has been transformed in both stores and internet opereation..PE of 50 like TJX ==> 150..
Soon... Reddit people come in and push this 100... But I rather slowly rise...My wife favorite store..
Macy is back... My fair lady favorite stores..The survivors take all the sales.
Macy's internet business value is not priced in yet.
Amazon now planning to go head to head with Walmart and Target lol. Look for that sector to go south. Macy's to the moon!
"Let me give you facts. I started in 1995. I closed last night, and the many racks of new receipts were being brought onto the floors. The store is being stocked for the upcoming fall season. There is a lot of stock coming in. Two points, lot of stock coming which will aggressively stock the store for a strong buying trend, and two, THIS IS THE VERY SIGNIFICANT POINT, we are in August, and that is usually a ghost town period, a time when in the past, there was reduced business activity, and we are busy nonstop. If August is busy, there will probably be an even busier fall, and with Christmas being the period where shopping trends are at the peak for the year, this year is going to be explosive, especially if the COVID trends become controlled and reduced. This time is the time to be forward looking rather than cautious. Yeah, don't know the price points to come, but the stock trend is upward for the future, very strongly upward for the future."
Congrats to all the shareholders. Wow!
"price action, share buyback, and dividend are going to squeeze the shorts hard..."
We might see some profit taking around 25 unless we get a good squeeze...No doubt in my mind this will be in the low 30's by years end though !
M is easy to own... Grow 60%.. PE is less than 4..BUY BUY BUY
"Wow, now JPM joins the bull camp. Macy's must be rockin' it out lol. Buy."
Macy's is all about how to keep the cost down and provide a slightly more upscale and comfortable place.
I am confident about M earnings.

"If I pump too much, people angry at me... I try to contain myself.."
I was avoiding M for 6 month. Sold for 17.9 bought back today for 16.7 10k shares. I think it is going to be $25 by the middle of August. Agreed - AMZN loss is huge Macy's gains. Was waiting for this almost two years.
"M sales grow 60% ... 30% from internet... In my book, that is supper good."
With reinstating the dividend It replaced my salary and M just allowed me to retire and live off only the dividend. Never selling a single share!
bye
"still massively undervalued here folks, especially after Q2 earnings, dividend , share buybacks and raised guidance. Delta shall pass as did the much worse part of covid did last year."
A lot of bad news on TV often means the market will head higher.
$150 if it is valued the same TJX
"if they say $27 that means its going to move $37-40 Just imagine amount of toys Macy's going to be selling toward to Christmas. Also they have started giving out dividends back to investors. Yep, They will be taking away toys business from Walmart, Target, Amazon and more. Yep, win win win for Macy's."
JWN's report confirms that Macy is doing exceptionally well...$26 tomorrow...
"Bullish option flow detected in Macy's ( M Loading...Loading...) with 27,679 calls trading, 1.0x expected, and implied vol increasing over 2 points to 65.62%. 8/13 weekly 20 calls and 8/13 weekly 19.5 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 14,000 contracts.When you see this with only a 1-2 day expiration means the big money is buying calls and tomorrow the institutions will jam the common stock higher, sell the calls for a massive profit then bail the shares."
$24 closing.. let me be conservative..
$25 soon !!!
25 or 30 on Friday. i need to know
"It's uplifting to see the street still values cash rather than themes, macro ideas, etc. Buy."
They had some interesting insights about M on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"MY financial advisor thought I was a bit out to lunch, but I bought at 6 about 13 months ago. Wish I had bought a lot more! I think they have put themselves on a great path."
It said the stock worth more than 20.00 a share . Look at the call action at 24.00
21 weekly puts here all in
A transformed Macy is doing a lot better than Nordstorm.. and cheaper too.
"AMZN loss, and PINS dropped like a rock(-18.35 today and after hours), means people are out SHOPPING again!! Great for Macy !!!"
Another day another high.. Making money is easy..
Less department stores operating + success online = A lot higher we go.
I do miss Robert with his Macys & Amazon buyout theory. He deleted 15 days of posts and is creating buyout theories on the RKT message board. If getting to a million dollars is as easy as creating Amazon buyout rumors I'm all aboard.
keep adding.. too cheap..
"MONSTER BEAT- actual $1.29 vs. exp .19… doubled 2021 earnings expectations, $500 M stock buyback, bringing back dividend for 3rd quarter- MONSTER REPORT!!!"

"If shorts think today was bad, wait until the analyst upgrades that are coming in the next week."
2 more hours to sell your shares numnuts it is going down after market!
Short sellers waiting for a dip to cover their positions but just keep seeing their losses pile up. This will just keep getting worse and worse for them and will keep driving the price higher.

"I think Macy will catch KSS stock prices, at least.. But 100 is possible.."
Macy shock the world by soaring 22%...
Unreal earnings . Can’t say enough good things about management. Very happy shareholder!
"Macy's Remains a Tough-To-Own Name Despite Q2 Beat (no place to cover your shorts, if that is what you mean)"
"M seems to always do this. Hit a new high and then retreat to previous support. Just a matter of time to $20.00, maybe over reach to $19.00 and then recover."
You all remember how astonishingly wrong that Yahoo Finance hack Brian Sozzi was on this? Explains why he’s trying to make a living by working on Yahoo Finance.
WIth this kind of growth and profit... we should have the same PE as TJX...
M projecting $3.60. That makes M a 30+ stock at 10 times.
40% clothing at amzn is returned... so wasteful
Sell Macy and buy lucid even swap. You will be the winner
Come on you beautiful $M! Keep climbing!
"Go with a Winner, Go with Macy's and ..........."
I got $3.60 per share an 18% short and a microphone. Let's rock.
Reuters says the problem with Macys is the insider trading!
reading charts is like reading a holy book....everyone sees the story they want to see...nobody knows whats going yo happen next
Take us down all you like. $3.60 this year plus the lush dividend will send us over $30 soon enough!
"See my post from yesterday exactly what happened this morning. They bought calls yesterday. Jambed the stock higher premarket, then dumped both for massive profits at the open. I saw this coming before the reversal and added hedges, short calls and long puts above 20."
Book value per share: $11
Should have bought call’s instead of puts  Oh well…good on everyone making money on M
TJX PE of 50.. Let us do it.
Next qtr and Xmas is going to be better.. Nice..
Out with a nice 25% gain. Wanted to raise some cash but this may go even higher
20 is new support level. Im adding here for dividend and holding above this level.
"Now that's a business that knows how to treat its investors. A straight shooter, When times are bad suspend the div etc. When there's a .turnaround we all share in the fun. Rewards for all; Associates and Investors. Thank you M"

I am M will continue buyback program.. The company is transformed.
M just hits the buy point... Nice.
Sellers here leaving serious amounts of profits on the table. Even Zacks now sees this. Buy.
Stock is too bullish.
Buyback program+dividends+Blowout earnings. I`m in.
by the time that buyback is done.. M is already in 60..
"Technically speaking, this thing is top heavy and the run up today was people FOMOed out from yesterday."
"Macys had a blowout quarter on all metrics, exceeding all expectations."
"I love the latest Zack's article raising M to #1 strong buy. Zack's had an article last week saying Macys was a #3 hold. What changed in a week? The article says nothing other than pop corn fart facts about how Zack's system works and percentages this and that with vague statements. Sounds like an MM is desperate to dump M shares before the earnings disappointment. Disney has already sounded the Delta variant alarm on earnings this week. M went up $3 a share the two days before last earnings because I think earnings was leaked. If M tanks before earnings Thursday, you can could on leaked bad earnings. The reason for the Zack's article for one last push for Macys lemmings. South Carolina doesn't require masks in schools and 10% of students caught covid and are in quarantine. Of course, there's one Macys in SC, because Belk's won and there in bankruptcy."

"By the way, when is the Macy's Tower in Herald Square?I heard they are going to start a leasing business?"
"Wow, this is awful. Across the entire sector, retailers get mauled daily by the bears.....I hate the stock market. My advice to anyone thinking they can outsmart the market, stop what you are doing and go back to work. Forget about the stock market. Trust me, I've tried for 10+ years. The only people making money in the market are the ones that sell you books on how to invest and trade, the brokers, the insiders, and those that have the money to influence the outcomes. This advice is worth millions and I'm giving it to you for free."
Massive beats always lead to massive stock price gains. Any questions?
"Still cheap considering institutional buyers will just be getting in here. Algos will go crazy if this thing goes over $22.30 (52 week high, well was for a few seconds!)ANYONE go to the ToyRus website? It says ""How Geoffrey Made It To Macy's"" This is a big deal people, Since they went BK parents have been scrambling to find things for their kids. Target has made most for the money but Macy's can clean up here. WOW though I would sell on a pop like this but I am jus SO IMPRESSED."
looking steady after market.
so we think nobody is pulling profits tommorow???? cmoooon people are scared and greedy lets see how much my puts pay tommorow at open...
"A lot of us M shareholders are already true longs, not just in M for a quick flip, but now with this stellar quarter report results and shareholder perks being added a ton of more true longs will be joining us in M."
"I bet Macys blames shoplifters and inside larcenies for there up coming earnings miss. Of course, with there creative accounting they could blow out numbers. You can't save your way to profits or close stores to increase cash flow. Unless you cannibalize real estate and put sales cash on the bottom line like its apparel sales."
"How do I get the CEO of Racial equality job at Macys that Ms Felicia Williams holds at $1.1 million a year? It seems like a secretary could crunch the numbers and do this job as a additional duty. At some point Macys will not be able to borrow more money. Why not get rid of this position now and give it as an additional duty? Kicking the can down the road didn't work for Kmart, JC Penney, Sears, Montgomery Ward, Bradlees, et cetera. We can't borrow ideas from the past."
They had some interesting insights about M on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
They're saving on shipping charges as gasoline prices continue to rise. I'm excited for these b&m legends showing amzn how it's done
reading so much bullishness on here calling for 30 40 and 100 makes me much more comfortable that it is going to sell off and might even go lower than before the earnings. The Toys R Us news is that it is bankrupt will have problems with supply chain and will start next year selling at M.

"In early February, I wrote why M was undervalued at $15. At the time, I said in the long run M was worth $30-40/share. With the current closing price at $22.46/share, I still believe this expectation is achievable with the $40/share target more probable.M’s management has come out of the COVID crisis achieving some amazing results. Over the last five quarterly releases, they have beaten analysts’ expectations by $0.96, $0.60, $0.69, $0.78 and $1.06/share sequentially in each quarter. How can analysts be so far off the mark on this company? They currently have 7 underweight/sells on the stock versus one buy from an analyst at OTC Global. Kind of reminds me of late last year where every analyst was bearish on GME before it took off. Management has already spoon fed analysts that earnings will be $3.41-3.75/share range for FY22 with their recently raised guidance. However, I would not be surprised if they beat that in the upcoming two quarters with monster “back to school” sales in Q3 and huge Q4 holiday sales. Back in early February, analyst were expecting M to only make $0.65/share on average this year, but now the average expectation is $3.68/share, but the stock has only moved up $7.50/share on an additional $3/share in earnings. Can you say “Undervalued”? I contend analysts are maintaining negative outlooks on the stock because a large number of their clients are still short M (36M short as of mid-August). It could present a lush target for retail investors to expose to a squeeze as almost 90% of the float is held by institutional investors and insiders.Over the past three quarters, M has dramatically improved their financial position. They finished the current quarter with $2.1B in cash and $3.3B in long term debt while projecting EBITDA this year of at least $2.6B. Earlier this month they used $1.3B of that cash to buy back debt coming due in 2025 (8.375% interest rate) which will save over $100M interest costs per year and add $0.25 to earnings next year. The remaining debt level results in a net LTD debt/EBITDA of <1. M certainly is not a company that is in financial destress and I would expect the ratings agency to upgrade M later this year. Also, realize that the real estate they own is still worth more than the current market cap of $7B, which adds an additional margin of safety to owning M.With the improved financial position, management was able to reinstate a $0.60/share annual dividend which amounts to a 2.7% yield. They also authorized a $500M buyback program which will allow them to use their strong cash flow to buy back shares. At the current price, they could buy back 22M shares or 7% of the float. So with the dividend and the buyback if executed in the next year, that would equate to almost a 10% return to shareholders which is nice.I still contend M is undervalued when compared to its competitors. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.33 compared with Kohl’s (0.49) or Dillard’s (0.78). One could argue their share price should be selling for between $34-53/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their stronger e-Commerce business which made up 32% of sales in the most recent quarter growing 44% above 2019 Q2 results. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 3.9 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.58), #8 Target (1.25) and #9 Costco (1.07). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $39-85/share. I will stick with my contention that M worth a lot more than $22.46/share. With me now getting paid a solid dividend, I can wait for Mr. Market to realize that M is undervalued. I expect that I will be able to sell my shares for more than $40/share in the next year. I am long M and still buying at these levels."
Don't fight this run up... M @ 25 is still a forward PE of 7.
MACY'S will Blow Away the earnings....... Hedge Funds buying up CHEAP SHARES
3 down days! Nice. Let’s see if we can do 4. This thing is eventually going to pop up. People are afraid of the unknown with the delta variant but we are not going back into lockdown. I’m dying to continue buying while I have the chance.
"Record Covid cases, the fall of Afghanistan this week, supply chain across the globe malfunction, is this just not the greatest country ever we are going higher. Goodluck in your trading all."
"Another new high; when we break 26, 32 is my next target."
@Nomanski help we need your unique view on the market and Macy’s place in it. Thanks
back to 15 i can't wait.
$100 year end... Turn around plan works really well.
This should pop 15%. Barely up 5% PM. Forward PE is 6-7. That is crazy. I am buying and holding. This should be $25-30.
if LULU can have PE of 30.. I see no reason why Macy can not have PE of 25
gamma squeeze
"Go to ToysRus website. They are highlighting their new relationship with Macy's. They have to be happy, remember ToysRus is bankrupt so no one will give them any credit to buy anything, having Macy's involved brings their brand back to live and brings truck loads of profit to Macy's. Can't wait to see where this brings Macy's, so many kids beds I purchased from Toys over the years."
The collapse of Afghanistan at this time may have little to no impact on Market. Longer term it will be devastating for the entire world. The families that lost loved ones and that were injured my heart goes out to you. To all traders Goodluck in your trading.
