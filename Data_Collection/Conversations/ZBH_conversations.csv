"What happens in 2021 when Lorecicivant comes to market?https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/conversation-osman-kibar-ceo-samumedSNIP:Take Samumed’s lead program, lorecivivint, which is in phase 3 for knee osteoarthritis. There is no treatment for osteoarthritis that reverses damage to the joint, so doctors focus on managing symptoms: They prescribe exercise and weight loss to improve muscle strength and reduce burden on joints as well as drugs such as painkillers, anti-inflammatory meds and cortisone injections. Some patients may eventually undergo joint repair or replacement surgery. Lorecivivint is designed to fix joint damage, so patients don’t need to go through all that. Samumed expects its phase 3 osteoarthritis study to read out by the end of 2020 and hopes to submit lorecivivint for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2021."
$ZBH Reiterated by Robert W Baird Buy Initiated by Raymond James Financial Market Perform
"Some credit due for the spin the company executives put on a soft quarter. The inability to make meaningful debt reduction is a lingering concern. The company may not financially positioned to combat the never ending litigation processes (lawsuits, recalls, product liability issues) that regularly occurs in this type of business. The debt seems to be manageable, but only if the business dynamics remain positive. High profit core implant growth patterns are concerning. Leary that the new technology platforms being highlighted can add meaningful dollars to the bottom line. Nice technologies to talk about, but time will tell if they play out. Undoubtedly, the current political health care climate will reinstate pricing pressures going forward. Every quarter the company boasts how good their management team is, a little less bragging and a little more growth/profitability would be reassuring. The stock price is favorable because of the overall market, if the market begins to pull back, the price will pull back quickly without some real sales growth. Is the risk greater than the rewards?"
"Increasing the debt, renewed going forward pricing pressures, and the spin off of Dental and Spine (spinning off more than likely means they couldn't find a buyer, not marketable segments) makes the outlook in question. Agree it has been a tough year, but leadership doesn't seem to be reacting accordingly."

"Watching ResultsNot expecting any Revenue movement. Zimmer purchased Biomet, combined Revenues roughly $8B, seven years later, Revenues roughly $8B. Revenue remains flat?Increasing expense ratios. Debt reported past Quarter increased to $7.85B. Did results make enough money to pay notes, or did debt increase again?EPS, past Quarter EPS $1.90 ($.67 profit, $1.23 write offs). Are adjusted earnings still being used to make the numbers work? Lets hope adjustments are turning into profits?Hoping for better results. Not interested in any more ""Pent-Up"" demand talk, or talk about vanity R&D projects."
"Good news sales coming back, bad news where's the money. $2 billion in sales and only $142 million in net. Seems like a big gap. Most of the large joint product lines supposedly have a 50%+ margin. Something seems out of line. $1.90 adjusted earnings, only $.67 in the pocket, versus $1.23 adjusted, company appears to be struggling finding dollars. This is confusing as the margins are supposedly high, and the sales are coming back. Where's the net profits?"
Great results followed by immediate large drop. The norm on wall st it seems.
Anyone know why it’s up 13% after the close today?
"The historical norm for a company in this sector growing high single digits and earnings in line, typically maintains a PE ratio between 20-30. Currently this company doesn't have the sales or earnings to support its 58+ PE ratio. Like the company sector, but not enough upside at current ratios."
