Probably will not see $20 anytime soon
"$CORT make a 80% in few hours. Endo is next? Endo also produces hydrocortisol!!!LONDON (Reuters) - Treating critically ill COVID-19 patients with corticosteroid drugs reduces the risk of death by 20%, an analysis of seven international trials found on Wednesday, prompting the World Health Organisation to update its advice on treatment.The analysis - which pooled data from separate trials of low dose hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and methylprednisolone - found that steroids improve survival rates of COVID-19 patients sick enough to be in intensive care in hospital."
"After a long but patient wait , we are finally getting the reward we deserve ."
"something going on, no? Nice volume"
So funny watching the shorts try an manipulate the order flow with massive blocks of shares that are not real. As soon as you test them they pull the sell order but every now and then you can grab a few shares from them. I could be wrong but I think this is going to close green today.
"Re-posting an old post:When I have time, I will show you CORT has 1) an impeccable records as a growth company (income statements); and 2) an almost perfect Balance Sheet with no debt.The origin for this level of short attacks was from the so-call ""morning-after"" abortion pill, which has similar composition as KORLYM (mifepristone), and the genetic drug companies thought it was free money on the table. We all know a chemical compound, when used for a different indication, should be treated as a new drug if it is under patent protection. Making the story short, the court will decide the patent case within a year, while Teva may not run the risk selling generic version of Korlym although the legal stay just expired on 8/1/20. CORT's new drug for the Cushing’s syndrome - Relacorilant - is a single receptor blocker, as oppose to Korlym being dual-receptor blocker with side effects. Relacorilant is in phase III trials, which will be approved and replace Korlym with new set of patents protection."
Just added another bucket of shares at the close.It appears some good news is on the horizon regarding the Mife patent approval....
thanks god. hope the momentum keep going......
"this stock used to trade at a lot higher price .. now that earnings reports are still in constant uptrends , why is the price NOT doing what it used to .. is the teva problem causing that much weight on the stock price /"
"Anyone see buy yesterday for 466,000 shares at the end of day?"
"Followed this stock for years and yes this is both 1)short covering due to 2)either an offer or simply news of how undervalued this company is (or was until today!). Unfortunately I got greedy and was hoping for another overall market correction due to this crazy bounce-back from Covid, but yes it has a sensational monopoly/franchise in its market and will keep growing and adding products over time. Excellent growth with Korlym, excellent pipeline. Today the market recognized this, and it didnt hurt a director bought a cool $500,000 recently around $12.50. My previous target was $20, I had hoped to get in at $10. If its a short cover primarily then allow this to re-settle and dig back in."
UP or DOWN......Monday should be interesting......maybe a surprise in a positive way!
"SP AH starts to jump around 5:11PM EDT with no apparent volume, but stay there the rest of the day. Still no news at all. Total AH trading volume: 20,885 shares. Will keep digging."
"Folks - there are two companies that filed patent charges against CORT. The one settled yesterday was almost irrelevant. keyword - almost. It obviously would not have been a good thing if they lost.The larger one is with TEVA and will probably come down the pike by the end of the year. And even then, it will certainly be subject to further reviews and appeals by the losing party.The long game here is in the critical advancement of the Relacorilant trials. As long as Corcept keeps piling up the cash and continues to provide exceptional results in the advancing trials, that is where all the focus should be on for anyone investing here.I implore anyone not understanding the difference to do a little more homework. This is probably going to be a stock that continues to move sideways until the goalposts become clearer near the end of the year. In the interim, those who believe in the long term prospects and the Management team's hyper conservative style should continue to add to their positions. I certainly have been and will continue to do so if it reverts back to the $12 range again. ALL IMO!!!!!!!!!"
"I think CORT's SP has settled for now. It's time to play covered call again, but I don't want to lose (be assigned) my shares though.Sold 5/21/21 call options at $33 for $2.00/shares. Today's trade of 225 contracts (22.5K shares) are all mine for a total of $45K. Unless the SP shoot up above $33 by 5/21, my shares will be safe. My risk is forgoing any gain above $35 ($33+$2).I do think the next catalyst for CORT's SP is either the NDA for Relacorilant or positive results from any of the P1/P2/P3 trials for breast, ovarian and pancreas cancers. All are at least more than 6 months away."
does anyone have an opinion on the lawsuit? could that be why the stock price is suffering? I am long but concerned..
"i blame management for overestimating the guidance. they should have kept expectations low,not jacking up numbers after Q1 100% YoY growth. 50-70% YoY Growth seems to sustainable at least until Teva's saga is resolved. Other than that everything is on track. market totally ignored strong data from high doses for rec. let weak hands exit today. Stong reversal in the following weeks after market digest data and numbers which are not bad at all."
"It appears that one of the motions to dismiss was withdrawn and signed by the Judge on 8/1. Corcept filed an automatic extension on Friday 8/3. Lots of action last week on the lawsuit.

This is way over done now as this stock is trading for just a little more than 6x 2018 sales. Even with a generic coming out in 3-5 years from now sales by then should be around a Billion dollars a year.
Coverage initiated with an $18 buy rating. Let's see if we can finally take wings....https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2959568&headline=CORT-Corcept-Therapeutics-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-HC-Wainwright
"CORT is an amazing company with low market cap, low shares, zero debt, over $200m cash, good and growing revenue, positive growing income, increasing cash, good pipeline and progressing, share buyback, good and steady management.Short sellers and TEVA generic propaganda have pushed the price down to current levels but the company released facts about short sellers false information and also got a new patent plus old patents that will shut up TEVA. A new lawsuit is filed against TEVA and obviously TEVA and yellow journalism are bed with short sellers."
Might be some strong buying into the close.
"Today's AH trading is a little different from yesterday. There were 6 trades right around the closing SP for a total of 9880 shares, followed by one trade of 100 shares at $16. So, today's AH SP jump is not real."
"Yes, there were 88.3M shares traded yesterday, not counting AH and PM volume, and lots of talk about bag holders.In fact, in this electronic age, daytraders trade in and out frequently, and oftentimes, multiple times a day, even in an hour. At the end of the day most of these daytraders don't own the stock, but with a creidt or bill to be settled in two days.So folks, with 122M diluted shares outstanding, of which 90% is owned by funds/institutions, there cannot be too many bag holders, while the shorties are real in numbers - 22M of them to be exact prior to yesterday. I wonder how many of those shorties left today, which we will find out in about 2 weeks."
"I couldn't find any other news other than that a director of the company bought $500k worth of shares last night, hows that justify a 55% jump?"
This is so ready to run. Everyone has been looking for a bottom. I bet it closes green and gaps tomorrow.
"When a buyer targets CORT there will be no news.When buying negotiation is competed there will be no news either.However, one morning a news will be out. There will be no chance to but or cover even one share below $20."
Are the Q4 earnings released prior to market open or after close tomorrow?
"The important facts that I learned from CORT's earning releases for Q4/2020:1. Rev growth slowed, and profits saturated (not surprising since Korlim already passed it prime) 2. Cash increased to $476.9M - an increase of $161M YoY, and all clinical developments are self-funded.3. Relacorilant's GRACE and GRADIENT P3 trials are delayed due to pandemic pushing NDA to Q2/2023.4. Major catalysts: a) metastatic pancreatic cancer P3 trial RELIANT to report results in H1/2021, and b) metastatic ovarian cancer p2 trial to report results in H1/2021.5. Management is not concerned about any of the legal challenges from the generic companies.Folks, this is an exceptionally well managed company. The delay of Relacorilant is not their fault. The current SP is fairly valued at about 10x sale of Korlim. Only positive results from pancreatic and ovarian cancer trials will put its SP on the upward slope again, but we're only a few months away from the good news!"
"Spike was due to TEVA's motion to dismiss being denied. My take, initial response was interpreted as whole case being thrown out. Once folks realized it was ""just"" pushing things forward and the trial still needed to take place, the exuberance was squashed.Still, I think this is a big win for CORT. (Operative word is think)... Doesn't this ruling ostensibly safeguard the pipeline for years?Or am I missing something regarding events to come?"

"institutional shares holders are in control,in an attempt to shake weak hands.the stock tested it bottom,and ready for uptrend from here on.got my 5k shares today.glta"
I don’t understand what’s keeping this stock I want toInvest in it but nothing really shows what’s maintain a positive reaction
"P/E 12, PEG under 0.4. This thing is crazy undervalued considering 100% YoY rev growth. Basically trading like Teva is about to launch generic lol."
The short hit worked for those clowns short term. BUT it gave us longs another great spot to add big time AND CORT it spend that $91M they have earmarked to buy back shares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. Sights set long term my friends/ Take care and have a great day
"This was 100% expected news. The Management said precisely as much on the call just last week.Statistically speaking, 85% of these cases are allowed to move forward. CORT's story is ALL about Relacorilant and making it through the next 18 months during this threat of generic launch process. TEVA is ostensibly fighting for table scraps.I picked up a nice chunk of extra shares tonight and will continue to do so in the future if the weakness continues to the down side."
Someone is working really hard to keep this down. Shorts better cover. It moves fast. GLTA Long
Inside trading this week and major movement after hours. Big news coming?
"even though it's up today, all of the large shorts got me wondering"
"I have suffered thru a lot of volatility with CORT. Earlier this yr, some idiot analyst came out with a sell, and a $7 PT. CORT had been at 9+, and of course headed down. Never got to 7, but it was nail biting time.The analysts currently guess that CORT could earn .88/sh next yr. Whatever they earn, the rev will be about $240M. There are few biotech companies with a 50% growth rate that aren't selling for 9-12x rev. I could give you a list.But CORT is a small fry, subject to a lot of short selling. On top of that, there are 2 issues, one, today the bio etfs are all down. IBB off 1%. The other is what effect on drugs distribution and pricing the CVS deal will have.The former will pass, it always has. The latter will play out over time.I sold at 19.50, back in with a lot at 17-17.50. I'm holding tight."
Big blow this resignation... It sounds as if there is a disagreement on the Phase 3 tests start...
Ingalls & Snyder LLC Increased Stake in Corcept Therapeutics INC (CORT) by $15.14 Million
Looks like pretty good support at $13s lvl; anymore potential drives that can cause this thing to double up in 2020?
Hard to find a growing biotech with this type of revenue pe and no debt
Buffet invests in TEVA. He wants to see drug prices drop. What follows is a decline in research and fewer medical solutions. And he thinks he is so smart. He should just keep investing in Dairy Queen.
"yep, been waiting since end of july."
"I think they are accumulating shares. It may take few weeks to months. If there is no significant bad news, it probably can reach $26 or higher this year. Be patient with confidence. I believe It can give very good return."
someone doing panic sell?
"Can anyone tell me when the earnings are coming out? The ""estimate"" is Aug 7. But it's strange that the company has yet to report when earnings will be released."
"Fabulously pumped two day, day trade up 12 percent and 33 percent...but where is the real support level at?"
hitting all time highs today .. nobody cares but me ?
I'll admit. I'm very suprised that CORT has continued to see such high volumes of short interest after we recovered from the earnings fiasco. I thought we would see a slow and steady base built back up.It's a risk. But I'm now tripled down on my position and am holding the most shares of any one stock I own.Good luck longs....
Have been watching this stock for awhile and wonding if its to late to invest in? Shoudlve bought back at $15.77. Any thought?
"I'm curious to get some folks' take on the significant, and consistent downward pressure on the stock over the past months.Full disclosure. I am very long, and have doubled my position at an average cost of $13.50 over the past few weeks.Is the general consensus that this stock is more or less thinly traded and can be be easily manipulated? Is the TEVA overhang really the sole basis for this precipitous drop when any small amount of research should fairly easily allay those fears.I've been around long enough to understand there's no guarantees and the market dictates values etc.... Sure TEVA really could muscle their way into the space.... But given the financial position of this company and their prospects, this drop makes less than zero sense to me. I'm desperately trying to talk myself out of buying more because pigs invariably get slaughtered. But this just seems like an extremely rare opportunity to load up on a tremendous opportunity."
"thought cort will pull back a little today. but, it is not. nice day."
Upgrades coming soon.
need to have 2 more days up....this is a pattern.
"On June 11, 2019, Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (the “Company”) announced that it has received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter advising that SunPharmaceutical Industries Limited (“Sun”) submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(“FDA”) seeking authorization from the FDA to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of KORLYM Mifepristone Tablets, 300 mg (“Korlym”) inthe United States"
shake out of retail investors - gonna end green. do not fall for it - it's a gold mine.
Come on CORT - baby needs some new shoes!!!
"Bought some at $14.55. Earnings, revenue and cash look good. Will add more if the shorts keep pressing it lower."
Any arguments on why you believe this stock will recuperate?
"Two large institution investors( Vanguard, Ingalls & Snyder) added shares recently based of the sec filing."
"So we are a little less than 3 hours into the trading day, the volume has already crossed the daily average and, after a nasty drop at the open the PPS has recovered roughly 70% of its initial decline. So, this tells me that there is demand for the stock at significant volumes. My guess is it recovers reasonably quickly and then moves forward."
Definitely feels good to load up in $15s after Teva's gift. $20s in 2-3 months if not sooner.
"this should be a major buyout target. if I was a big pharma company sitting on billions of cash, I'd definitely be checking CORT out...just saying.....let's make it a $40 buyout price and call it fair"
Having just read an article on Seeking Alpha about TEVA it seems as though they are possibly looking for a cash settlement due to deteriorating financials. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4143170-700-million-gift-will-stop-tevas-slide?li_source=LI&li_medium=liftigniter-widget
Today is the day
Another Friday and another motion to dismiss by TEVA. Is the market trading the lawsuit or the fundamentals
"This guy gets itIf Sun Pharma and Teva fail to launch their generics until after the court actions are finished, then we expect Corcept to have over $550M in cash at the end of Q2-2021. We model a maximum cash burn of $225M by December 2022. Maximum expenditures are driven by a “triple-success scenario” with Cushing’s, Pancreatic Cancer, and Ovarian Cancer. This would necessitate investing for future revenues: regulatory filings and establishing sales teams in the United States (oncology) and Europe (Cushing’s).We do not think any sane investor complains about this ""worst financial"" situation."
"Going up and no one seems to care. Well, I own it and I care. And it is going higher IMO. Was that an echo?"
Very good relative strength again with very good volume.....shorts not doing so well
Very excited to hear more about the updated trial results tomorrow night. What the shorts don't seem to realize very well is the current revenue stream is only a means to fund a much larger end game. This looks like really promising results.
Can someone tell me how the pipeline looks on this stock?
Welcome to the Nasdaq Resort and Casino.
Announces another patent and goes down after hours. makes sense
Good article over at Seeking Alpha...Worth the readhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4207368-corcept-therapeutics-growth-investors-biotech-pick
Up day on Monday
"Check the after hours for 450,000 share buy.....10 minutes after close $18.49"
"I feel like these board is owned why whiners. Cort btw is still about 60% up for the year. You cannot just wake up overnight and see Cort back in $20s again. After such run and Teva ""correction"" stock needs to consolidate for a little bit. I see this as buying opportunity. If you cannot stomach 30-40% decline biotech you should not invest in biotech at all"
When is the earnings? WTH
Not a bad day so far (up $1.21@ 3:04).
This is just outhttps://dbtnews.com/2020/05/20/corcept-therapeutics-incorporated-cort-moved-up-2-56-why-its-important/
"Hmmm. Not sure what happened to my other post. I imagine earnings tonight will be a distant second to any comments they make regarding the TEVA situation.Other than providing a strong statement to their intention to defend the patents, and perhaps some clarity regarding how high the barrier to entry is for the generic, not sure what else we can expect. What do you guys think?"
"It is acting like a stock with good fundamentals,"
"There was over 7,000 sept $12 puts sold today. Thats over 300k worth of options bought in one day.Somebody thinks this going down."
Stock is a big winner!
CORT looking good. Very bullish on this one.
"sgt says, today we will $15"
"Anyone with contrary argument to concluding paragraphs to article published by Motley Fool last night?""Patent challenges fail more often than they succeed, but the situation doesn't look good for Corcept. The 214 patent covers a warning and dose adjustment instructions on Korlym's drug label that physicians would need to follow when prescribing a cheaper generic version.Korlym is potentially dangerous to some patients because it inhibits CYP3A, an enzyme tasked with clearing a very long list of drugs from the bloodstream, including statins. Since Korlym is one of many drugs with dosages that physicians regularly adjust to address CYP3A-related interactions, there's a better-than-average chance the 214 patent won't survive Teva's challenge."""
Apparent Bloomberg note that court hearing today on their drug patent (vs Teva generic) is going well.
no rebound at all?
Just sold...I plan on buying in again hopefully at a lower price.
"Corcept notified investors that Teva filed an ANDA to the FDA, seeking to sell a generic version of Korlym. The Notice Letter states that patents ‘348 and ‘495, with expiration dates in August 2028 and August 2036 respectively, will not be infringed by Teva’s proposed product, are invalid and/or are unenforceable. Corcept intends to vigorously defend its extensive IP rights related to Korlym, and will probably sue Teva for infringement. The lawsuit will trigger a 30-month stay and allow Corcept some breathing room – if Teva is successful in court, a generic Korlym will likely come to market in 2H 2020."
Next price is around $7.
someone is trying to lower the price before it goes up big.
CORT director bought 100k shares and spent over $1.1 m of his hard earned money for CORT shares.
If you guys long I'd not even bother watching this dog every day. Everything at this level is a strong buy for at least 1-2 years hold. In few months this will be in $20s
I’ve been trading for long but never seen any Biotech hold that big spike for long!

Today we are rewarded for holding through a few tough days. Up 8.58% pre-market at 8:44 EST based on preliminary q4 revenues and guidance for 2018. Previously analysts were looking for $240 million revenue in 2018. Guidance is for $275-$300 million. Sweet!
is cort in quiet period b4 er?
This is a biotech not a pharma. The fact that they have a selling product and a pipeline is way ahead. It is difficult to est sales for a drug to treat such a rare disease. Right now there is no debt and 20% of the co in cash and investment.
"Come on folks. Use your noggins here. If the joke of an article cited for today's steep drop really holds that much water, why is TEVA trying so desperately via lawsuits to fast track entry into the market via generics?The writer of that article is named Roddy Boyd. Who is he? I'd check on the credentials of this ""author"" before allowing him to influence your investment decisions."
"if management is assured for 2018 and 2019, I can only come up with mm doing the tricks now."
"Re-posting an earlier post on the other board from 9/2/2020:Hold on to your seat. The current (today) SP just reflects the revenue potential for the one approved drug - Korlym. Kolym's better cousin will be approved next year with IP protection plus other cancer drugs in the pipeline. CORT's SP target should be $30 in one year, and $50 - $60 in 3 years."
Does this much dropped has purely to do with ~ -17% earnings surprise or something to do with the company's announcement of a program to repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock???
finally news everyone needed - stock roars up on it and then all the way back down . guess good news means nothing today
"what do you think the possible reasons can be for the drop on feiday despite good q4 results, apart from short interests and stop loss triggers?"
Shorts or people bailing due to revenue miss? Short squeeze in the future?
"I am nowhere near any form of a chart expert, so take this with the requisite grain of salt, but the current PPS is interesting for several reasons:1. The PPS actually went UP after the administration published its ""shame list"" of complaints about companies allegedly trying to prevent competition by abusing the generic drug system (this list included CORT). I this is really interested because CORT and TEVA are actually locked in litigation about this. I would not have expected this directional reaction in the PPS, but since biotechs in general bounced when the administration announced its plan to lower drug prices, the net effect seems to be that the market does not believe the efforts to push generics as a form of price protection will have a significant effect on biotechs. This is not a political statement, just an observation.2. The current price of $18.56 represents a key level of resistance. Since the TEVA announcement this level as been hit 3 times (Friday being the latest) and it has failed to push past it each time. How it behaves next week and whether it can muster the energy to push past this level will be very important. Actually, if you look back prior the the nice run to $25 that the TEVA announcement crushed, the PPS has moved around the current level for close to a year. With earnings on track this year, recorilant progressing and the TEVA issue moving into the rearview mirror as the slow wheels of litigation turn, the PPS has an opportunity to make nice progress over the next few months (assuming the overall market cooperates). As we get into late Q3 and Q4 we will need and injection of new data and/or better sales to push it still higher, but right now I think it can progress on its current status nicely, particularly if biotechs in general continue to catch a bid. Good luck folks."
This is one of the most undervalued companies I have ever seen on Wall Street !!! Blue Horseshoe loves Endicott Steel and CORT !!!!!!
In the elevator going back up
Welcome RobinHood traders! Be sure you have your sell stops in place.
let's break 19 by end of month
"Wow!- 44% and 67% increase, respectively, in revenue and GAAP income from Q1/2019.- Non-GAAP income increases 70% from Q1/2019- Cash increases from $315.3M to $349M (11% increase from Q1/2019)- Company virtually has no debt, short-term or long-term, period!With these #'s QoQ and YoY, this should be at least a $40-$50 stock. So, why the SP stays in the toilet, and, like a clockwork, vertically drops every time it slowly climb up towads high teens.Here is my two-cents:1) A dark force consists of crooked ""financial journalist"", class-action attorneys, and financiers conspired to profit in shorting by bringing the SP down. It works like this: shorting by financiers then either a bad press of fake stories, or investigation for possible lawsuits, and quickly close the short positions for huge profits. Slowly and surely, the cycles repeat again. CORT's shares outstanding is 114.6M, but its short interests is 22M as of 4/15/20 (20% of all shares are shorted). I have estimated that the dark force causes the ""vertical drops"" in the tune of $3 to $5 about 2 to 3 time a year for the past 3 years. Using $4 and 2.5 times a year, they profited about $200M a year, which, IMO, is the most lucrative business on the planet. Additionally, the dark force has the vested interests in not seeing the SP shoot thru the roof, which will bankrupt their entire short positions.2) Generic drug vultures like Teva Pharmaceuticals challenge CORT in court attempting to invalidate the US patent on Korlym, which is sole money-maker for CORT at the moment. The outcome of the cort battle is not certain, and it will take more than a year before the final ruling. Like everything else, COVID 19 will delay legal activities. When ruling comes, CORT should have the better version of Korlym approved by FDA, which is protected by different patents for years to come. Besides, CORT has a long list of pipeline drugs under P2 & P3 trials, and any of these worths more than Korlym. For the fellow Longs of CORT, hold on to your shares until the final victory (at least $50). In the mean time, I use covered-call option strategy to generate income from my shares, which rides along Dark Force's. I sell (covered) call options when the SP is in the high teens, and either close the position when SP drops or sit thru the expiration date. The strategy generated about $50K to $80K income for me annually for the past couple of years, and I am still holding my 22K shares with no string attached."
Noticed the bid/ask is up this morning. Something is up.
Hey steve. I know this report is 7 pages and more than you normally read but possibly you should read it before you short #CORThttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1088856/000119312519027646/d625461dex991.htm
"If the Korlym patents hold up to Teva's patent challenge, well and good. But if they fall, then next comes the regulatory exclusivity based on the confidential clinical trial data CORT would have submitted to the FDA for getting the marketing authorization. Normally regulatory exclusivity kicks in right after patents expire. Hope CORT highlights this aspect, which may be a mitigating factor for their business."
I will be very interested to hear the company's detailed response to today's news.
Time to hunker down and weather the storm. Selling now is just locking in a loss on a company that is set generate over a quarter of a billion dollars this year.
Not much to this company. I sold my shares a couple years back for over $22. Glad I did
Have yet to address the teva issue which looms even larger than losing sales and why are sales going down?
"Why this sudden drop, without any news? Numbers remain strong, so makes no sense."
And where are all the fan boys?
Absolutely valid points about Cort and Teva's NDAhttp://alanhobbes.blogspot.com/2018/02/overnight-thoughts-on-cort-prta-capr.html?m=1
This is why I never trade with stops on a volatile (or even semi-volatile
bought at black friday prices today :-)
"I just got in, great time to buy"
What's the reason for the huge sell off over night and continue into today?
3-day later. North to above 20
Just bought yesterday. Alright alright alright
CORT and TEVA have delayed the court case 1 week in order to negotiate a settlement at the request of CORT.
does anybody know how much now teva has to pay to cort?
"Corcept Therapeutics to Announce Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results, Provide Corporate Update, Host Conference Callhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/corcept-therapeutics-announce-fourth-quarter-210500081.html"
Director picked up 10K shares at $15.53 on the open market. Insiders definitely know more than retailers. Great buy signal
Will this stock rebound. 24mil shares are short 20.91% of float but probably higher considering insiders hold just under 10%.
"I'm okay, I bought in at 10.00ish."
Year over year EPS is over the roof.
So I haven’t really been following as of late. Why did this thing lose half of its value?
Man I love the color green :)
"i want to know if 25,551,901 shares Short Interest is it make trouble for the prevent selling the company..????"
Anyone have any comments about yesterday's trading bounce up at the end of the trading day.....a glimmer of positivity?
What was that I was saying about a short squeeze..... :) :) :)
Will it wake up for one more push AH ? Who is in ?
Dang! That revised revenue figure is a really bad look. Here's hoping the call calms the wolves down. I think tomorrow is going to be a blood bath regardless....Looks like it's time to back up the truck and buy a lot more manana....
"This stock is a swing traders and day traders dream. I did not play it like that, but the momentum traders both long and short should be making a killing. Hoping ~17.20 breakout keeps rolling to 22-25"
I just checked the 5-year growth estimate on the Yahoo Analysts page. It says -1% per annum!! I remember a couple of weeks ago it said 50+%. This must be due to Teva......
something is fishy....
"I'd like to share a couple of my posts from the other board:1. Had not been shorties and class-action vultures, CORT would have never showed up on my radar screen, which looks for deep values. This is an exceptionally well run companies with almost impeccable Income Statements and Balance Sheets.I strongly believe that it’s SP will be propelled to $50 to $60 range by the results of cancer trials, then it will join the $100s SP club when Relacorilant is finally approved next year.2. When it comes to SP prediction, your models are probably as good as mine. The market is currently rewarding CORT at 10x sale, which is on the high side of the multiples. Korlym's sale is about $300M/y. Relacorilant's GRACE (Cushing) and GRADIENT (Adrenal Adenomas) trials will expand the market of Korlym by 2x to 3x times (including female patients, who are not served by Korlym), i.e., Relacorilant's revenue potential is $600M to $900M. Using the same multiple of 10x, the MC is projected from $6B to $9B, that translate to SP between $51 and $77. The Relacorilant ongoing P3 trials were pushed out to 2022, and NDA/approval accordingly, but short-term catalysts such as trial progress/results are still possible.Cancer drug development is always risky, and it's too early for sales estimate. However, both pancreatic and ovarian tumors are notoriously hard-to-treat, any positive results from the P2 and P3 trials may double its SP this year - adding to valuation independent of Relacorilant."
What's happening post market?
No news out but I see insider buying 45000 shares yesterday
results are good - why are we going down?
"it's hard to understand how CORT could be 19.50 on Th, and today, 2 days later, down to 17.I understand the run to 19.50 was fueled by short covering, and I think the drop is driven by more short selling, but it seems to me that CORT is selling at 20x 2018 EPS (expected), with a 50% growth rate.I can't imagine that investors are selling, so I conclude the shorts are doing this damage."

"The teleconference is TODAY at 5 PM EST - Not tomorrow night. !!!MENLO PARK, Calif., Feb. 19, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) today announced it will report its audited 2018 fourth quarter and full-year financial results and provide a corporate update on February 25, 2019. The company will host a conference call that day at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time)."
Someone is cleaning out a lot of the stops today. Should resume it's upward climb tomorrow or Wednesday.
"In viewing results from the quarter they added a whopping 50 mil in cash and investment from 266-315 mil or 20% of market cap. That is impressive. If new drug comes thru phase 3 well this becomes a major takeover candidate. 375 mil rev guidance, currently 315 mil cash inv. And no debt. Easily worth 20-25!"
"The stock never does what we want it to do or when we want it to. Right now, buyers are scarce and the short position is increasing. The TEVA situation is scaring off some buyers and those who are willing to run some risk want to buy at or near the bottom. During the 2 week period leading up to 3-9 (last date short position was updated) the short increased by 11.5% to 22% of the float, days to cover 8. The shorts rarely consider the fundamentals. They just know TEVA has filed to market a generic for Korlym and they know that creates uncertainty for the longs and the would be buyers. The company responded with very good news about Korlym's potential replacement, but it's hard to be certain the company is as confident as they act. The short's and the weak longs are making it difficult to mount a lasting rally. Over the next 12 months CORT and it's shareholders should prosper, but the stock price will be very volatile with sharp moves up and down. Buy and hold is the winning strategy with this stock, but keep plenty of antacid on hand."
"Great company, pipeline, 0 debt, clear vision. what's not to like??"
Nice upward movement on low volume. Love to see some institutions hopping in soon
Just wait until CORT reports earnings in July and it blows its earnings out of the sky. Should jump to $18 easy.

Dudes do the math. They are making almost 50 mil a quarter in cash now and probably by 2930 year end will have 500 mil in cash or 4.50 a share on a 13 dollar stock. This is a private equity cos dream or this should be a 25 dollar stock. New drug in phase 3. Just lock and load and walk away
The key making money in the stock market is buying when the prices are down not when they are up. This stock currently has a RSI of about 32. It is very oversold and is due for a move upwards any day now.
Is Korlym that expensive that a generic would hurt sales?

"Sold covered call (1/15/21, $17.0) in two bundles for $3.8 AND $3.88, respectively, for a nice income of $86K (225 options) today. So my profit will be capped at $17+$3.84=$20.84 for the next 13.5 months. There are three possible outcomes to my CORT shares:(1) At EOD 1/15/21, if CORT is traded below $17 and my shares have not assigned by then, I pocket the $86K and keep the 22.5K shares with no string attached.(2) If CORT trades above $17 during the next 13.5 months and my shares are assigned, my total proceeds would be $17*22.5K+$86K=$486K for a nice gain of $176K (cost base=$13.(3) During the next 13.5 months, if CORT SP tanks, and the 1/15/21 call option price drop significantly below $3.8, I may buy them back to close my position with a partial profit (difference between $3.8 and buy back price), and the 22.5K shares are sill mine with no string attached."

Strong day for the indexes and strong earnings yet it just didn’t run. Makes no sense
Another faux desperate mass publication of litigation based on the SERF article from last yearHysterical.My humble prediction is we are up big tomorrow. People have finally seen the game for what it is regarding our potential and how ridiculously undervalued we are right now. Any weakness at all outside of normal markets and I’m pounding on more shares.
"Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) today announced it will report first quarter financial results and provide a corporate update on May 8, 2018. The Company will also host a conference call that day at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. I like the sound of that. In addition to earnings, a corporate update. Then a conference call. I hope the corporate update is positive, which seems likely. Maybe an update on development of Recorilant or a positive announcement regarding the TEVA situation. Recorilant seems the more likely subject for an update. Can't rule out other possibilities. Could there be an offer on the table for CORT?"
Oh look I made a good trade today. I bought an extra 400 shares before close!
no news at all.
"Zacks is a joke. Look at this article. They graded Cort as ""C"" and AMRX as an ""A"" in terms of value? I guess they don't know how to read an income statement and a balance sheet.1.

"This AH quote is bogus! Not much AH trade to begin with today, which is pretty much done by 4:22pm, which were all traded around the closing SP of $27.98. Then at 6:43pm, there is a trade of ONE SHARE for $29.71 - a 6.2% jump. I truly think this type of misleading activities need to be banned."
What happened today? Something leaked? I can't find any NEW news.
"What is the business model, how CORT is making money, well I have just read article answering those questions. Who is interested here is link https://finpedia.co/bin/Corcept%20Therapeutics/"
new patent for korlym got approved which makes Teva case more tough
"Earnings out. Q1 revenue 57.7 million (109% increase compared to first quarter 2017);GAAP net income of $0.14 per share, compared to $0.04 per share in first quarter 2017;Non-GAAP net income of $0.19 per share, compared to $0.06 per share in first quarter 2017;Cash and investments of $140.4 million, a $36.4 million increase from year-end 2017;Reaffirmed 2018 revenue guidance of $275 – 300 million;My take - very strong YOY growth and with reaffirmed guidance for the year the company is demonstrating that its projections are real and the business has also apparently shown no negative impact from the TEVA action. The street usually likes to see a beat and a raise so this may not be good enough to wow the institutional investors, but it is certainly very solid. Applying a sales to price ratio of about 10, which is likely in the ballpark for a company like CORT, you get to a market cap of 2.75-3 billion which would imply an upside of about 37%-50% from here, or roughly $23.87 to 26.04 per share, which right around the consensus 12 month price target of $24.67. Of course, this does not really factor in the pipeline value at all, so adjust accordingly."
Argus raised CORT to buy
I see a whole lot higher than $19 coming

"Volume is up only 26 % , the same thing happened to NVCR. It recovered fast and is up big today."
"It looks to me like several insiders took the opportunity to exercise large amounts of stock and sold them into the market on the 12th. Surprisingly enough, they got out at (you guessed it) about $19. It was clearly their large blocks that started it down from that $19. They're required to report the transactions on the SEC Form 4. Unfortunately, they're not required to say WHY the sold them."
I opened an initial position last week. Read the CC and good things are happening for the company. Could be a slow bumpy ride but it should move higher I see a mid-20 stock early next year. G/L
Zacks issued a strong sell for this 2 weeks ago .. good call huh .
Buy the dip
PPS climb seems to have started.
I hope this runs to the 20’s again. The company is in a great place.
It’s interesting that the allegations are baseless. First they quote the sirf article as though it is gospel and second they allege fraud due to lying about revenues now saying only 300 mil vs 315 previous. These are ridiculous and wonder if continued short conspiracy.
Watching for a lower low. Going to add if the price is right.
Shorts are making the money here. Might actually see $12/share today 
Spectacular update on the call. Very exciting times.I am officially adding to my position over the next week on any weakness.Solely my opinion. Good luck to all fellow longs....
Easy 18.xx possibly 17.xx tomorrow. CORT doesn't hold sharp gains well. Hope everyone sold covered calls on their shares to reduce their cost basis...
Lot of options pointing towards $19-$24.
Is anyone watching this?
"Today, CORT only has one approved drug Korlym for Cushing Syndrome with an annual sales about $350M.CORT’s success with Korlym is almost like a miracle. First of all, Korlym’s is the trade name for mifepristone, which is also an FDA-approved drug for terminating early pregnancy known as RU-486. RU-486 was approved in 2000, and its patents are all but expired. Korlym was approved by FDA in 2012, and CORT has seen its revenue doubling every year from 2013 to 2017 (from $10M to $160M). Then its trouble started. Generic drug maker Teva Pharmaceuticals had been eyeing CORT’s success with Korlym, and filed NDA to FDA for a generic version Korlym in February, 2018. CORT immediately fought back in Patent Court defending its 6 patents on Korlum. In June 2019 another generic drug maker Sun Pharmaceuticals join Teva on the challenge. CORT’s SP reverse course in 2018 dropping from mid 20s to teens and stayed there for the next two and half years. In the meantime, class-action vultures and professional shorties all had their field days – with constant lawsuits and at its peak, up to 20% of its outstanding shares were chronically shorted. CORT saw its fortune reverse course again last year: first in September the Patent Court proceedings started, then in November CORT declared victory in the legal battle. CORT’s SP jumped in both occasions to settle around upper 20s today.Secondly, Korlym is a very difficult drug to administer since it is an antagonist (blocker) for 3 distinctive receptors (PR, GR and AR): PR blocker is responsible for abortion; GR blocker beneficially improves the glucose tolerance in Cushing Syndrome patients with type 2 diabetes; and to a much lesser extent AR blocks testosterone. In fact, CORT’s victory against Teva was mostly brought about by the ‘214 patent, which claims the labeling and administering of the drug. Because Korlym interacts with multiple receptors, treating Cushing Syndrome involves carefully administering the drug as well as closely monitoring the patient for a long list of unpleasant side effects – some of them may lead to serious consequences. Due to PR blocking, a significant portion of female population of Cushing Syndrome could not be served by Korlym, and the use of mifepristone is tightly controlled in many States due to abortion regulations. Additionally, many patients taking Korlym have to be stopped due hypokalaemia (low potassium level in the blood).With a MC of $3.2B and sale of $350M, CORT’s SP is fairly priced – maybe with a little upward momentum to push it up to low $30s.In summary, it is estimated that less than half of the Cushing Syndrome patients are currently served by Korlym. So, what’s up next for CORT – Relacorilant is about to take the center stage!The story about Relacorilant is rather simple and straightforward – it is a targeted GR antagonist with much less side effect than Korlym for Cushing Syndrome. This alone should double its Cushing Syndrome patient base from Korlym. Additionally, it is currently being tested for patients suffer from Adrenal Adenomas – a benign tumor in the adrenal gland. The GRACE P3 trial for Cushing Syndrome is to be completed by December this year, and the GRADIENT P3 trial for Adrenal Adenomas is to be completed by June this year. When Relacorilant is approved first for Adrenal Adenomas later this year and for Cushing Syndrome early next year, it will replace Korlym with 2x to 3x revenue potential from Korlym.Next catalysts for CORT includes 1) Completion of Relacorilant P3 trials, 2) NDA’s for Relacorilant, and 3) Approvals for Relacorilant. These catalysts will further push its SP to $50 to $60 range by Q1/2022.The story of CORT does not end with Relacorilant though. There are various P2 and P3 trials for some notoriously hard-to-treat cancers such as pancreatic, ovarian and breast cancers. Development of cancer drug is extremely risky, however, if any of these pans out, CORT will hold the ticket to join the $100-stock club, or be swallowed by giant pharma long before that."
"The drop today is understandable (TEVA filed an NDA for a generic KORLYM). Obviously, if there were to be a generic version on the market, that would certainly be cause for a very significant reduction in CORT's PPS. This, however, is a really major over-reaction, especially at this point in time. Here is why:- Patent Infringement - CORT has patent protection on KORKLM for 10 and 14 years (on different aspects of this drug). Anyone who wants to make a true generic has to wait until those patents expire. Here, a generic is defined as the same compound, or one derived from the patented compound. CORT has already said it will aggressively defend its patents. The patent dispute process is lengthy (years) and will not be resolved before (in my view) at least 2021 or 2022 at the very earliest. - True New Drug - If TEVA has a different compound (i.e. one that is not protected by CORT's patents), then it is really not a generic version of KORLYM at all. Instead it is a competing product. As a competing product, an NDA (new drug application) is not the vehicle to get the drug to market. Instead, TEVA would need to file an IND (investigational new drug) application and proceed through clinical trials.In theory, TEVA could have found something about KORLYM that is not protected by CORT's patents, however I would expect this is highly unlikely. It is almost inconceivable to me that a publicly traded company like CORT does not have incredibly strong patent umbrella protecting all material aspects of its products. This leaves what I think is really going on here: Teva is primarily a generic drug manufacturer but about 20% of its sales come from Copaxone, which is an MS drug that went off of patent protection in 2015. Teva obtained patents on a ""longer-acting formulation"" of Copaxone, but within the last 4 months has just lost most of those patents in a patent litigation fight with Mylen. This has opened the door for Mylen to introduce a generic competitor to Copaxone. I think Teva is trying to use the same playbook against CORT - although I do not believe CORT is situated the same as Teva was. I think CORT is relying on primary patents and is not trying to extend the patent period with spurious ""extended release"" versions. I have even seen pharma companies try to put a coating on their pill and proclaim a whole new patent. Having said that, I have not reviewed any of the patents in either case, so I can't really comment from first had knowledge on the strength of any of the patents at issue. I can, however, say that TEVA is clearly desperate. They have 34 billion in debt and just had to raise $5 billion in new debt to take out some current debt. TEVA lost over 1/3 of its value last year due in large part to its failure against Mylen. My suspicion is that TEVA wants a deal of some sort. Maybe a deal on KORLYM in specific markets. Maybe a deal for CORT. Maybe a cash payment to go away. I think this is a swing for the fences sort of move by TEVA that has a very low probability of success. CORT will no doubt address this in their conference call and with then immediately pivot to the raised earning guidance they have pre-announced. If you are long CORT and have dry powder, this is a good time to add to the position, in my view.Good luck."
CORT share price....IMO it will sit between 11 and 12 till earnings in a month....unless news comes out....opinions???

How to destroy 1/4 of market value - release any BS news about a years-away-patent dispute ... nice
The low amount of interest on this one kinda boggles my mind. Great fundamentals and several key catalysts in the near future. At the very least it's a great lotto play.
"Revenue is double from last year, what happen next couple year if the revenue double again? If they can reach 500mil plus, how much will be their share price by then?"
I don't believe there is a reason to hunker down. The storm has hit and leveled it. This may actually pop soon. Markets are terrible and it keeps bouncing off low 15's. Margin calls should be settled now and shorts would be crazy not to cover after this downward gift. Buy folks!

Too many retail shareholders here. As soon as they manage to scare them out it will normalize. The more convinced retail shareholders are to keep the stock the lower they will send it.
Happy New Year folks.Just dropping in to say I have nearly doubled my position again on this over the past month. A chance to get this stock below $12.00 given the prospects and updates is absolutely insane.I have more on reserve for any continued down side weakness. By Q3 I think we will be ready to start the run up.Anything between then and now is gravy. Happy to keep loading up in the interim.Best of luck longs.

"I copied this from an IV post this week. TEVA is not running over CORT. The plan is to delay the application or the generic Korlym until the next generation is approvedSome news on the legal case: two year patent prosecution & FDA bar in the DCO is Denied.I believe it's another ""small win"" for Corcept as I've been following closely but it seemed that TEVA was pushing hard to include patent prosecution and FDA bar.

Teva seeks to include a DCO provision that would bar outside and in-house counsel who receive information designated as Confidential pursuant to the DCO from participating in patent prosecution and FDA correspondence related to formulations of mifepristone, the drug product at issue in this Hatch-Waxman litigation. (DE 69, at p. 1). Teva seeks to impose this patent prosecution and FDA bar during the pendency of the litigation and for two years after its conclusion, including any appeals. (Id. at p. 2). Plaintiff Corcept Therapeutics, Inc. (“Corcept”) opposes Teva’s proposed patent prosecution and FDA bar. (DE 70). Corcept indicates that it will designate Vice President of Legal Gary Francesconi as its representative under the DCO, and it has represented that Francesconi “does not have involvement with” patent prosecution and FDA correspondence. (DE 70, at p. 5). As an alternative, Corcept proposes a DCO provision that bars attorneys who receive Confidential Information from using that information for patent prosecution or FDA petitions. (DE 70, at p. 2). Corcept’s proposed language provides in part: “All Confidential Information....shall be used by a recipient thereof solely for the purposes of this litigation and not for any business, regulatory, commercial or competitive purposes, including, but not limited to, filing or prosecuting patent applications or any communicating or petitioning activity with the FDA.” (Id.). [A] party seeking imposition of a patent prosecution bar must show that the information designated to trigger the bar, the scope of activities prohibited by the bar, the duration of the bar, and the subject matter covered by the bar reasonably reflect the risk presented by the disclosure of proprietary competitive information. ” In re Deutsche Bank Tr. Co. Americas, 605 F.3d 1373, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Here, Teva has not met its threshold burden of establishing that its proposed patent prosecution and FDA bar is a reasonable precautionary measure. In light of Corcept’s designation of Francesoni and its representation that he is not involved in competitive decision-making, Teva’s fears about the improper or inadvertent use of Confidential Information are speculative at this point. The Court’s denial of Teva’s application is without prejudice. If new, particularized concerns arise about the use of Confidential Information, Teva may renew its request for a patent prosecution and FDA bar. Conclusion Teva’s request to include a two-year patent prosecution and FDA bar in the Discovery Confidentiality Order is DENIED. The parties are directed to meet and confer and submit a proposed Discovery Confidentiality Order, consistent with this Order, by June 11, 2019."
"This is exactly why Cort is only about 6% of my portfolio. Word ""Teva"" makes weak retailers hit those sell buttons very fast. Ppl don't realize that even Teva gets generic to the market within a year ( which is very unlikely) Korlym sales are NOT going to zero. Of course there probably won't be 100% YoY growth but I don't expect negative YoY as well. As of now there is zero value assigned to pipeline. 100% YoY with ridiculous P/E 15.. it's hard to beat this even with Teva overhang. Will be adding below $14 for sure if it ever gets there."
so company has 400 million cash on hand. market value 1.8 billion. so if you buy the company you get the 400 million it seems like an awfully good buyout candidate. thoughts
Really nice to see the upwards momentum. Let’s hope it continues. The shorts have extremely little margin for error here. It would be great to be at the right end of a short squeeze
This stock is way over sold.
Rare breed in biotech and it's a buy. - Amazing revenue growth - Good pipeline with proof of concept - Cash flow positive and no debt- Strong institutional support- Very solid managementTell me how many Biotechs you know in $2-5B range that are actually profitable? I don't know many. Today's pps action and an opportunity to add after yesterdays call. Teva is not a threat
Powerful chart pattern 3 year consolidated base. Breakout looks like it's forming.
Sure is a quiet board for a stock that is up 40% in 23 days.
87 million shares trading .... and you call it just a spike? Seems to me that there must be a more logical explanation
I would buy Teva based on long term growth in generics....
"At this point, with how depressed this stock is, the shorts are truly playing with fire.It will be one of my life's joys to watch them get burned.....https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=921&mn=2527&pt=msg&mid=19169052"
Slowly creeping up. $25 is not that far down there he road. I plan on being here for a while. Patience will pay off in this name.
"The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a decision upholding the validity of all claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,195,214, “Concomitant Administration of Glucocorticoid Receptor Modulators and CYP3A Inhibitors” (the “‘214 patent”). The ‘214 patent expires in 2037. Goodbye TEVA. 25% increase after hours. Today will be a great day for all who is long on this."
This will spend most of the day green. Thursday will be a big day. Institutions will want this at these levels.
"There is clearly a very dedicated group of investors with deep pockets who have shorted this at extraordinary levels. Given that the company is cash flow positive and can fund their own trials through next gen, it makes no sense to me to be aggressively short. The revenue flow at risk should be obsolete in a couple of years. Usually these kind of strong arm tactics are reserved for companies desperate for funding. We (CORT) are nowhere near that boat. If you are in this for a short term gain, you're probably in the wrong stock. It's been my experience that the shorts are usually able to squeeze a story or two out of the headlines to give themselves the opportunity to exit. So it wouldn't surprise me at all if we continued to experience downward pressure. But again, there are VERY..... VERY large votes of confidence coming from the Management team. Options not being cashed, but further invested. Insiders buying at the current PPS and higher.I'm very long this stock and believe in the management team. I continue adding on occasion because I truly believe this price is a gift. There is large risk here. Undoubtedly. But also the prospect of a mammoth upside reward.The shorts have taken this from $25 down to $11 and they still want more. Perhaps they will get it. Perhaps they will get slaughtered. The biggest risk for us longs is it may take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years before we get any significant news. That's a lot of runway for ""bad news"" to pry shares from weaker hands. Stop losses and margin calls...... But good news may come tomorrow. Who knows?At these prices, I'm not willing to risk being on the sidelines. I'm essentially all in and adding more. It sucks to see the paper losses grow, but it feels good to get the opportunity to add to my position at this ridiculous haircut of a price."
