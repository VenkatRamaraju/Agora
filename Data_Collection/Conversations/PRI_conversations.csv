Low P/E with a lot of retirees needing their services....big over reaction to downgrade. Can see this at $130 even in mkt decline.
Amazing Company I’ve learned so much. Primerica concepts change my families life!
is this a good investment at these levels? I herd they are getting back into real estate ..
Primerica reached an all time high at 139.52
understanding what we do is the first step!
Look at the stock price since 2010 AND ALL THE SHORT RECOMMENDATIONS!!! Hilarious!!!
Any advise about being part of this company?
I just got a call from the company. Never applied. They bought my info to try and recruit me. Straight MLM pyramid scheme. Won’t be long until this drops to $20. I put my short order in
