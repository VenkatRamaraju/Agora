"My girlfriend interviewed with this company last week. Pretty clear it’s a MLM scheme/pyramid scheme. Trash company that will fall hard one day. If you can’t give your reps leads, you aren’t a real insurance company. 100% ponzi that’s expanding to be recognized for what it is. Never asked my girlfriend about her experience, simply tried to sell the fact of why she should work for them.... therefore, it’s a ponzi. MLM is never good for any employee. Trash. I’ll short until they get exposed and then I’ll enjoy the rewards of recognizing the trash"
