TO EXPLAIM WHY BUY BUY BUY
Was looking good there for a while.
APOG is down 13.74% to 17.96
I bought 500 shares for $30.70
"I would say that APOG is definitely a defensive stock for the next quarter. Quite simply, millions and millions of dollars of glass has to be replaced, and that is not discretionary spending it’s absolutely necessary.￼ they are a conservatively run company and with this unusual boost in product demand will easily beat estimates. And, this is more of a retail investor stock because of its low average volume. They averaged $.59 over 4 quarters in 2019, and hit $.72 in the 2nd quarter of ‘19, so while the estimate of $.20 considers the covid factors for the upcoming June 25 ER, an investor needs to look at the earnings potential of the ￼August reporting period to to see the real discount in today’s price."

"APOG decent shout here. EPS of 2.32 and a low P/E compared to its previous 5yr AND industry average. If the P/E normalizes up to its usual average of 19, thts a roughly ~$38-40 stock. Thoughts?"
"TRADING HIGHER IN A DOWN MARKET wonder WHY???? Don't all you short give up at one time wait until 80 my PT on APOG. O WY all those fires PIR squeeze nice double in 6 weeks LUCKY sometimes. USG Warren Buffet might know what he's doing you think??? SWKS its not all about AAPL people and CRUS from CNBC the ECHO is sold out.
