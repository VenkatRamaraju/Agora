"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
This has to come down more. 35-36 range
Nice cash position. Dividend to remain the same. See you all back up at $45
How does this CEO have a job ?
"This stock has been all over the map since I purchased it a little more than a year ago. I was in the black just four weeks ago, now about 20 percent in the red. I had seriously been considering selling (while it was up), but I like the dividend and can't think of something else I'd rather own right now. I wasn't going to add to my position, but finally decided to pick up a few shares today to average down my cost basis. Unless things get drastically worse and they cut the dividend, I'll stick around."
URI and UHAL are up big.R is down?
what's wrong with this stock.It is down 3 days with blown out earning.Don't get it
"For claims this is a ""dead"" stock, I'm up 65% in the last 100 days! And I bought more than 10 shares.....though I wish I had picked up more.Like any investment, it's about timing and a little research."
Ryder System reached a 52 Week high at 90.58
dead stock. doesnt even move day before earnings. zzzzzzzzz
"40 straight trading days without a bottom in sight. Market up 2.5%, Ryder down 10% from it's open at $30 tags new 52 week low. Headed to under $20 for sure."
dividends remain and stay !!!!. awesome company..just hold the shares and enjoy the compounded money...
Ryder System is down 4.91% to 86.55
Ryder System reached a 52 Week low at 27.29
R reached a new 52 Week High at 87.68
"I’m in! Averaged in at $35.67. I’m still looking to add a bit more, but I’m in for the long run. Planning on the 6%+ yield to help me retire. I will reinvest the dividend for awhile."
Any thoughts on the recent weakness in share price?
"I find it comical that a company has a very good quarter, in a very difficult environment and is taken to task for it. All anyone hears today, in corporate America, is Diversity/Inclusion/Environment, and a bunch of left wing talking points. To that end, companies pay bonuses to workers, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing (companies need to make this call), but is something that falls into the ""Good"" corporate citizenry of today's politics. It also happens to to affect the bottom line and in Ryder's case lead to a miss. Add in the .38c impact to the .83c revenue numbers and you get an earning beat of $1.21, 27% above consensus. Hilarious! Hard to do the ""right"" thing in today's world."
See Ryder trucks everywhere.
"I am bullish on Ryder1) Supply chains are reformulating back to US. Lots of transport required to carry parts from various suppliers and assemble2) B2B and B2C online transactions grow with the need for physical fulfillment3) Technology will help drive lower operations cost e.g. increase capacity utilization, better alignment with logistics buyer/shipper4) Businesses will continue to outsource non-core activities like logisticsMarket will get around to recognizing the fundamentals soon. In the short term, markets are panicking but even then does not take much to realize all those empty store shelves need to be re-stocked with toilet rolls."
