insiders are selling... they must know something they didn't disclosed... Earnings were great!
I rented a Ryder truck to help move my son-in-law it was a great truck clean ran well. I wonder if Obama will be using Ryder truck to move out of the White House or 2 men an a truck.
Last day of tax selling! (Not that anyone watches R... most boring stock in the index. And three huzzahs for boring! ;)
R is down 9.78% to 53.52
BUY SPCE for large 1000 % returns in the future
"This stock has been all over the map since I purchased it a little more than a year ago. I was in the black just four weeks ago, now about 20 percent in the red. I had seriously been considering selling (while it was up), but I like the dividend and can't think of something else I'd rather own right now. I wasn't going to add to my position, but finally decided to pick up a few shares today to average down my cost basis. Unless things get drastically worse and they cut the dividend, I'll stick around."
R is down 5.10% to 49.46
"Down 47% since January 16 high of $57.38. Would need to rise 88% just to get back to those levels. Price target average is about 54.50, meaning R would need to rise 78.5% just to meet 12 moth price target."
Southbound Train headed for misery. Corporate remedy? Whip the slaves more.
"green day today, bottom is in. look for heavy volume prior to close"
"I am bullish on Ryder1) Supply chains are reformulating back to US. Lots of transport required to carry parts from various suppliers and assemble2) B2B and B2C online transactions grow with the need for physical fulfillment3) Technology will help drive lower operations cost e.g. increase capacity utilization, better alignment with logistics buyer/shipper4) Businesses will continue to outsource non-core activities like logisticsMarket will get around to recognizing the fundamentals soon. In the short term, markets are panicking but even then does not take much to realize all those empty store shelves need to be re-stocked with toilet rolls."
R is up 5.01% to $47.41
Yeah...we have an analyst upgrade today from hold to buy p/t $69...!!!
R reached a new 52 Week Low at $64.98

"Another assault by DB on this fine company, a buy sustained yet a p/t cut. What is this but a downgrade...exactly. Thus we have R down > than $2.50...right off the bat. This all stated around the first wk of Nov with 3rd qt earnings...where some newswires came out with R having missed eps. NOT TRUE, R made the EPS right on the money...no matter, it tanked 10% from $60 to $51 and change based on the headlines. No matter R increased revs and guidance...we are still living in tanksville. A real good company suffering for all the wrong reasons...and I keep averaging down, especially today."
"Ryder has last 5 qtrs of NEG eps growth and next qtr is another NEG eps growth of -22%. It is hitting resistance levels and has a historically high current TTM PE ratio compared to past 2 years. Look at the various technical indicators like RSI, etc which have triggered sell signals. Check out estimize site to see the NEG eps growth data. I recommend selling at this peak and even short it."
See Ryder trucks everywhere.
3 years worth of gains wiped out in 1.5 months because this company is going bankrupt. stay away. no one's buying. this is worth $22 max
Ryder System reached a 52 Week high at 62.72
"Market lost a major part of the gains at the time the helicopter crash into a NY High rise...now coming back and hopefully taking back RVLV....what a strange trade. My other stocks like AMD, ZS, XLNX, TWLO doing fine..even ROKU coming back although sold some."
Quarterly results looked great...I don't understand why it's down 4%? Any insights? Revenue and earnings up impressively YOY.
R reached a new 52 Week Low at $52.51
"I find it comical that a company has a very good quarter, in a very difficult environment and is taken to task for it. All anyone hears today, in corporate America, is Diversity/Inclusion/Environment, and a bunch of left wing talking points. To that end, companies pay bonuses to workers, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing (companies need to make this call), but is something that falls into the ""Good"" corporate citizenry of today's politics. It also happens to to affect the bottom line and in Ryder's case lead to a miss. Add in the .38c impact to the .83c revenue numbers and you get an earning beat of $1.21, 27% above consensus. Hilarious! Hard to do the ""right"" thing in today's world."
R is up 5.18% to 52.83
Wow those were disappointing numbers. Missed by a wide margin. Down over $4 in pre-market. Do we head back to $63-64 levels?
This market just hates value

Ryder System is up 4.91% to 76.02
Ryder System is down 8.85% to 38.44
Apparently a $46 book value has no meaning since Benjamin Graham is no longer with us. We will apparently suffer a 3%-5% drop every day and then just sell the trucks.
R is down 16.74% to 25.72
Back in 2008 this went down to these numbers and I kick myself for not getting any
R reached a 52 Week low at 43.10
My guess is that R is due for a pullback in the short-run. Not sure how awesomeS-TOCKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
Any thoughts on the recent weakness in share price?

"I’m in! Averaged in at $35.67. I’m still looking to add a bit more, but I’m in for the long run. Planning on the 6%+ yield to help me retire. I will reinvest the dividend for awhile."
"Year end and 4th qt earnings will beat current expectations. Why...the price of crude has fallen some 15% in last month to low $50/bbl and these savings go to bottom line. Plus there is a crude glut that is being expanded by the shale drillers in the Permian Basin where b/e is < $50 /bbl. Regardless of OPEC/Russia these folks are keeping up production because it is profitable. In nx 6 months 2/3 ADDITIONAL pipelines from West Texas to Houston are scheduled to be opened. Bottom line, much more crude to the refiners at lower price and BIG savings to R. Count on it !"

"after being taken to the woodshed for the past few trading days after what didn't appear to be that bad of an earnings report and no surprise when reading UHaul's report, it looks like R finally found support and good buyer. What a deal to get R below 38 with a solid 5.9% dividend yield. I see R back to 45s in the next few months."
A very nice day. 70S coming.

My opinion is: CEO spends money without a thought. Lays off people right before earnings to free up cash. RH bloated and run by an impulsive . It's a matter of time! That being said...I can't wait to try their restaurant in the new store.
buy NEE
"Words kill, especially those that are FALSE. Ryder met their EPS expectations, was above on revenues, and increased guidance at 3rd qt report. Yet some newswires got it wrong and stated R had missed EPS. Even SCHW had a miss at 15/100 of one percent, not by using the real consensus, but one from outer space. The result.. new lows then and again today. There is no doubt... the stock market is grossly wrong on Ryder."

"If you ever wanted to see a ratings agency due diligence on steroids...pls ck out R's 2018 presentation on their website. It has more ratios/matrices/info, put together for their bankers for extension of the revolving credit facility (I assume) than carter has oats. Of course such extension was granted. The stock market has it WRONG, on R, as it reached a 2 1/2 year low yesterday...at $51 and change. R may not be a $90 stock it attained a few months back...but it sure is better than $51. Peace out."
"Robert Rushing, I am a very disappointed investor in Ryder but I still own it. I am also a heavy oil & gas investor, much to my recent regret. What I can't understand is your post below that is completely about oil prices? How am I supposed to think that low oil prices are benefitting Ryder in a big way? Have I missed something? This company is primarily a truck leasing company that certainly hopes to get long term maintenance agreements on the trucks that they lease. Do you think that lower diesel prices and gasoline prices will make R more profitable? If so, help me understand?? I am open minded being on the losing side of oil prices right now. Your post below looks like you are typing it to an oil investor not to a truck leasing investor."
This puppy reports tomorrow? Any place is good entry. Pre-market unless market is selling then wait for bottom price during day.

Today last day to get in on divi if that matters to anyone????
"By definition...there can be only ONE consensus ...for R's EPS for the 3rd qt. And that was $1.64. This agreement was backed by Yahoo Finance, the AP, and Bloomberg. Yet just today Briefing.com came out with another ""mixed"" headline...citing an earning miss. R met on earnings...beat on revenues...and increased 4th qt guidance...END OF STORY. The real hurt came last Friday am...with R plunging 10% ($60 t0 $54) at the open...due to these misguided, incorrect headlines. Am sure we'll see $60 in the future...but so far, no soap. This gross inattention to detail...needs some sort of penalty."
Any idea why they're down 5% when they crushed earnings and increased guidance?

This cannot be...nothing but positive items since 8 am on Friday...!! There are NO MISSES on anything for 3rd qt results. I am in shock !!!
