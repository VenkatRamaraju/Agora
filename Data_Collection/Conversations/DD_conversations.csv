"Hey Greg..............you have pointed out some very sobering facts about value destruction under the Breen Leadership disaster. Your $109/share price is spot on for the reverse split that many are forgetting about, then you have to uncover what the DOW INDUSTRIALS have done since the same period. The DOW INDUSTRIALS have risen approximately 43%. Therefore if DD just kept pace with the DOW INDUSTRIALS the current price should be closer to $109 x 1.43 = $155. Here we sit at $70.90 with over 50% destruction in relative value of the once great DuPont Company. What is the Board doing to get quality leadership in place? I can guess that the family is not very happy? With the Dividend cut from what used to be $3.80/ share, I guess retirement funds and retirees are not happy. In summary.....relative stock price down 50%+ and Dividend down 50% I think many would want a do-over with Ellen."
Never did recover from the merger with DOW 5 years ago. Lesson learned Buffett says run on any merger even acquisition. Tighten your stops. My cost based is $98.
in doorknob we trust?! you joking me…. I trust my #DD and my wallet. LONG and STRONG PKK TNT
DD down below 70. The analysts who set a one year price target of 92 must either be related to Breen or on drugs (in my humble opinion).
"This is one stock, no brainer. I buy the dip on my #DD and the fundamentals. Put the technical charts away.. this is about money making and having the courage to have skin in the game, and riding this to the moon and hanging on as tight as you can. If you got the. courage based on DD… I DO… I bought the dip…LOL"
"Q: What does February 7, 2005 and October 18th, 2021 have in common?A: DD stock price was the same at around $72/share.What ""outstanding"" performance by this ""wonderful, well managed, customer focused"" company!"
87 1 year high falling 72 lower a 91 1 year target.
Earning expected to double but that’s what the expert said 5 years ago
No news? Why the move up?
"To those upset about DD being down so much recently, I think it is attributed to many believing that we are in mid-cycle recovery, and not early-cycle anymore. Cyclicals being dumped during a seasonally weak market period, but there is value here. Dupont is able to get through this tough period of pricing, shortages, and inflation and continue to grow its equity. It is only a little of 1x Price/book. Real value here and pricing power"
If DD beats or rises after earnings it would be an opportunity to dump it. After years of trying to beat merger price target has been a failure. Even the present target fails the test.
"DD down 2.5% so far today. So much for the upgrade by JPM. It's hard to make ""garbage"" smell good."
The short report has been a god send and the dip it created was another opportunity for those who have done their #DD and have already locked in massive gains. Love this
"I know what I own.. Ive done the #DD and it is proving why I will most likely be correct as to why I bought the dips (I usually do not buy dips but average up during the up trend cycle)…. but with PKK/PKKFF/TNT… this one, Ive put away the charting.. and based on pure strong fundamentals Im strapping on my moon suit for another ride up to the MOON (AMC/GME moon rider here)… Dont get me wrong. im long on this one."
"""F"" sounds like a ""bot"" designed to ""push"" stocks. Don't be fooled with these so-called ""day traders"". It's a good way to lose your money. Plan on a ""dollar cost averaging"" investing style in low cost index funds over your multi-decade career. You'll be very happy and comfortable when you are retired."
Bought ~1000 more shares today… also bought ~ the same lot # a few days ago when it bottomed. Peak has and is making me money based on my #DD and timing. #MONEYRUSH #p1p #capitalgainer #nobrainergainer
Waiting for at least a 2% yield to start buying
Analysts estimate for annual earnings = $4.30. Shareholders need a dividend increase.
DD has been the dog since the split up into 3 parts.
Very poor performance after the merger my cost based is $98 was that 5 years ago? Buffett said once a merger begins in fighting begins. When that happens investors lose. In this case upper management didn’t care about investors
