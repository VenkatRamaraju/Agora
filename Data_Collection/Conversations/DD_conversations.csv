"If one reads the corresponding articles that were just released about how the ongoing trade war will continue to effect revenue & earnings projections beyond the first quarter, they would also see that this is causing major pain on this one. Holding back the further hike is good, but the huge amount of uncertainty this one had to begin with only exacerbates the concerns. Or we could just float the conspiracy theories, I guess that works for some."
Interesting Seeking Alpha article published yesterday on DWDPhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4236710-2019-spin-offs-unleash-value-embedded-dowdupont
Anybody else notice Cramer avoided talking about DWDP this morning. Funny how he likes to point outwhen he is right. His many misses he doesn't like to talk to much about.
"OK...so let's say you want to look at a 5 year chart...""that gives us a better picture"", right?I'll summarize...DJI - up 91.27%AAPL - up 472.91%DD - down 6.53%Just what the *&$@*& are shareholders getting for their investment. WE know what the leadership gets. Lots of salary, low priced stock, options, performance reviews that DO NOT tie performance to compensation. It's time for Nelson Peltz to come back, not only FIRE Breen but sue him and his minions into oblivion for corporate malfeasance and then just chop us the parts and be done with it. This company will never survive like it is. It's just a slow death and it's painful. This company doesn't attract the best and the brightest anymore, can't understand the markets they are in and couldn't run a lemonade stand in the desert city with 1,000,000 people driving by the street corner they were on. One of their most recent promoted guys...and I have no idea who he is...maybe he's great...now running Water and Protection...hasn't spent more than 3 years in any job and most jobs were about 1 year. There is N O meaningful impact anyone can do -much less be adequately measured by - in one year. This company is a car full of clown!"
My take. It is impossible to value the three new companies created by the split untill they have at least two quarters of performance. This explains why Wall Street and fund managers remain on the sidelines. At least one of the new companies stock should outperform by 2019 year end. I believe Corteva will be a winner.Enough with the conspiracy theories of buy back manipulation. There simply isn't enough interest in owning DWDP until splits are completed and new companies can be analyzed.
getting smoked on good earnings while EV makers with no earnings doubles every few days.
"I'm sure people have seen this type of posting before, but to all of those longs who endured the 2008/2009 meltdown of Dow stock and the accompanied near disastrous Rohm and Haas acquisition, I give you a major congrats at this time. I no longer understand the present valuation of Dwdp from its present financials, but am glad I stuck with it. I have a modest position, but it will certainly improve my retirement. I hope there are many others who can say likewise or have done better. Sorry if this seems like a wasted posting, but sometimes reflection is a good thing."
This is a very Legitimate question so please if you guys don’t mind give a thoughtful response.If you have 600 shares and this splits 3 ways do you have 200 shares of each company?Next question would at the split the shares of the 3 company’s be worth more than the share is for the one company.I have owned Dow for years and it’s done nothing since it merged with DuPont.Now after this sale off I’m concerned that all the effort I have put into holding on to this is for nothing but the little I have gained from the dividend.
Market up 200+ for the first time in 5 days. DD down....as usual. Yawn....
Is there any chance that I can recoup my 60.00 average after all of this is said and done?Any chance at all?Any?
in doorknob we trust?! you joking me…. I trust my #DD and my wallet. LONG and STRONG PKK TNT
"of the undersubscrubed shares, how are they returned to remaining dd holders ? is it a free proportionate distribution, or are they shares offered to dd holders at a price?"
i want to buy but im gonna wait
"So if you have 100 DWDP now then on April 1, 2019 you will have 100 DWDP (with a lower share value) + 33 DOW and some lose change. Market will determine the price of each."
Cramer pumping this one.
Buffett is always right when it comes to Mergers. DD was trading at $109. Amazing failure
"The reverse stock split is subject to stockholder approval. If approved, the Company expects to implement the reverse stock split effective immediately following the Corteva Distribution."
DD disappoints. Same story different day. One thing that didn’t disappoint is Breen’s compensation.
They should be able to get a little pump from the infrastructure bill (I hope)… I know Dow def will
"I added 1,000 shares two days ago. I believe we will see over $80 before the first split!"
"Looking at the article on DuPont website, they expect 142 million shares of N&B to be available effectively converted to IFF shares (1:1). If the stock exchange offer is not fully subscribed, the remaining shares of N&B will be distributed among remaining DD shareholders. That means, if I stay with DD, I may have an opportunity to get some shares of IFF. Based on the price now for both DD and IFF and max conversion rate of 0.7180 shares of IFF per share of DD, it makes more sense to stay with DD if DD share is near or above $84.50. BTW, I will not get time to read through the over 400 pages of paper doc sent to me, so trying to figure out the gist of this."
close to 52 week low.......with market at close to all time highs
$87 to $69 yikes buy loonitoons love it after 4 years
Since the IFF announcement FD stock is down about 33% not to mention the decline to that point from the initial split. Tell me again why Breen is considered a business genius !
"@ bob: as for the answer to your question: Some company analyst wrote an article about DWDP in a favorable light. Don't worry about 2 percent moves up or down. It's market noise. Relax and have a ""non gmo vodka"". it's good for you. Focus on the next two influencers on this company: the earnings for th 4th Q and the spin offs."
"Hopefully later, rather than sooner most will realize the value creation of the three proposed companies. In the meantime, I will be adding to my position and come next year feel fortunate that I did. Good Luck To All !"
We need some upward momentum. All signals are looking good to merit higher pricing!
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM! Oh well, I’m still a believer at these levels!!"
Pretty soon this will be trading like DOW 30/40 under the merger price 98
Bottom? Where will the stock price bottom with the current turbulence?
I bought my kid 3 shares of DowDupont a year ago and it looks like he lost money. Shouldn’t he have gotten Dow stock in the split? I know it’s not the kind of money invested here but I don’t know what to tell him.
87 1 year high falling 72 lower a 91 1 year target.
Former Dow Chemical employees now have until 12/31/2021 to exit any DuPont stock position in the Dow/Fidelity 401k. Debating if this latest run-up is my trigger. Can't wait it out forever anymore. This is barely back to break even from merge/split pricing.
If the performance has been so great how come the price is dropping today after announcements?
To compare the value you had yesterday with today take 1/3 of the price of DOW and add it to the value of DWDP. Comes to about $18 + $37 or $55/share
DD has been the dog since the split up into 3 parts.
"Someone mentioned DWDP's short interest position. I was wondering about that. Those who hold short positions, may have a complex situation to deal with. When you close out a short position, you have to replace the stock. Once DWDP starts spinning parts off, that could become more tricky and expensive for shorts. They will also have to deal with the issue of covering dividends if they maintain their positions. I don't short stocks, but I usually look to avoid messy situations if I can help it with my investments. If I was short, I think I would use this weakness to close out my position. Any thoughts?"
"Nice pop today. Expectations of some kind of trade deal plus the coming split are definite positives. My position is about even, so I will be happy to sit back and see what develops. Shorts will have a lot to think about in the near term. Anyone who kept buying the dip should be sitting pretty."
"Jer X,Over 72% of DWDP stock is owned by institutionalised investors(pension funds, etc.) They would pay big money for your special knowledge, providing they haven't read your predictions from prior months."

Interesting group of investors represented on this site. Management gives guidance announcing 2019 profits will be flat. Stock price won't likely increase because we want it to. Stock up 8% in three days yet some on this site are experiencing the vapors over a 2% drop caused by Corteva guidance consistent with Breens earlier message. Big money on sidelines and very weary of owning all three.
If DD beats or rises after earnings it would be an opportunity to dump it. After years of trying to beat merger price target has been a failure. Even the present target fails the test.
Very poor performance after the merger my cost based is $98 was that 5 years ago? Buffett said once a merger begins in fighting begins. When that happens investors lose. In this case upper management didn’t care about investors
"Can someone please explain to me why the 1 year target for all stocks on Yahoo finance have not changed and remain high? I called Schwab, tears rolling down my face, last Friday as I finally panicked with my portfolio. My top 4 holdings, as I sold 6 stocks to save the gains as I watched them drop, are down on average $14-16/share so I feel stuck holding. Schwab gave me worthless information. Their structure is they get paid a salary, don't care about their customers and read off a script with what Schwab has to offer. How dare they tell me 2 of the 4 stocks I am still holding have A ratings I am asking for serious thoughts only if you feel this is going to go lower into the $40s or do I sell as I bought at $65.50 and move on. I trade in my rollover IRA so there is no paper loss. Previously I sold 25% of my portfolio when it was $57, sorry I didn't sell more then. thank you very much and Happy Holidays to you and your loved ones."
Cramer likes it now what
what is the true dividend of DWDPYahoo says 32 cents and DWDP website 38 cents
I have held Dupont shares for several years (worked for dd for 30 years) the last time dd had a spin-off was Chemours (CC) in June 2015. It spun off at about 16.76. On 2-8-16 cc was around 3.88 per share. on 10-23-17 it was 57.23. On 3-29-19 it was 37.16. My point is these current spin-offs will probably be volital for awhile but hopefully they will turn out the way CC has. Be patient. I will hold on to my shares. My best to all.
"I recently purchased DD shares and may decide to exchange them for N&B shares, but can't find anything on the DD website explaining how I would go about doing this. Can someone explain the process for me?"
So we end up with about .3766 shares of IFF in the end for each share of DD validly tendered if we have tendered 100 shares or more.Those that tendered less than 100 shares will end up with .718 shares of IFF for each share validly tendered for exchange.
Does anyone know what the sum of all the spin-offs and DD are worth in per spin comparison? It seems some are comparing the pre spin and post spin price charts. Are these charts normalized in any way?
I will be buying more...........
Down in pre-market again. What a stock.
We need some good news tomorrow. We are bleeding here. Hopeful that we will be able to scoop up some cheapies and we have a strong bounce. I am hoping it happens with this other one too. http://profiledstockpicks.com/OnDemandDelivery
I am a buyer at 66.55
"This is one stock, no brainer. I buy the dip on my #DD and the fundamentals. Put the technical charts away.. this is about money making and having the courage to have skin in the game, and riding this to the moon and hanging on as tight as you can. If you got the. courage based on DD… I DO… I bought the dip…LOL"
Nice action today on above 30 day ave. volume.
"Look over your shoulders folks. With Liveris now serving the Saudis, I'm thinking that once the old Dow spins, it will look a lot like the parts of Dow that the Saudis coveted. Since Liveris already partnered out the plastics chunk, I'm thinking a bid from Aramco is not out of the question. Given that, the stock buy backs and new debt could be seen as defensive moves. Comments?"
Let me add this was a Valueline dividend pick until the merger. Then they dumped it. So I am left holding the bag. As a trader got to know when to cut losses. I decided to stay on for the Divey. Lesson learned from Buffett run on all talks of mergers
I would like to know what value the shareholders have gotten from this merger. In December 2015 when the merger was announced DuPont stock was trading ~$74 a share
Insiders selling
"I bought DWDP when it was $66 per share. After the split into 3 companies, the combined market value of these 3 cos is 20% less. Does anyone tell me why so and when it might go up?"
Am still wondering what the spin off shares in the new companies will be. Let's say you now have a 100s of DWDP. What do you end up with after everything is said and done?
WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP RECORD:12/11/15: Deal announced --> closing price 53.37.12/11/15: Dow closing price --> 17265Today now DWDP price --> 53.54Today now Dow price --> 25381Results --> Dow increased by 47% ---> DWDP increased by 0.3%THAT IS WHAT THIS MANAGEMENT HAS DONE FOR THE LAST 3-4 years!
Question - when IFF merged with Dupont div- did the share holders at the time receive shares or anything?
I need some help please. I own 150 shares of DWDP and I will receive 50 shares of DOW. We still don't know at what price. What are the next steps in the breakup? I'm sure I am not the only one confused. Thank you very much.
What is DD going to do with the proceeds if it sells one of it's divisions for 20 billion?
"I wish I had free money .... not sure if people caught this tidbit in the call ...""He also said the company, which has global operations and often sources materials locally, does not expect any tariff-related impact on business this year"""
Dan Loeb's Third Point back into DuPont for 2.7 million shares....wonder what he and Breen are cooking up now?
DD: Dupont 's Q4-2020 earnings will be released on Feb 9-2021 before markets open.EPS estimate consensus $0.84. It is likely DD will meet or exceed the consensus estimated.We will see $5 pop at open and we expect DD will make it on Feb 9-2021.
Future Companies and Dividends? Expecting the new Specialty Chemical Co (Dupont). to maintain/increase the current dividend of $1.52/share..the Materials Science Division(Dow) $1.25/share and Ag play(Corteva) dividend..at least $1.00/share...Realistic? Maybe a little optimistic? Thoughts?
The positive news on China trade talks moves Dupont to $54.35 today and higher in subsquent day's as the tariff issue is held or suspended altogether. Both Countries needs this pact
Just a matter of when ... not if... this stock is gonna make it to the $80. range.Sure would be a nice Christmas present!
Can someone answer this...On April 1st you get 1 share for every 3. What is the price of that share and will the price of the old dowdupont fall by that amount. Thanks in advance.
"my next question as I continue to read and am having difficulty understanding this, what,if any, is the benefit of holding onto the shares we currently own? as an example if I own 300 shares will I then own 100 shares of each of the 3 companies value unknown? Is there any benefit to us for holding and not selling before 3/21? The only reason I have been holding is that I own the stock at $63.50 and can't afford to take a loss. any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thanking you in advance."
"Can someone explain, how did this power house become an outhouse? Is it better things for better living... through chemistry or miracles of science?"
"To those upset about DD being down so much recently, I think it is attributed to many believing that we are in mid-cycle recovery, and not early-cycle anymore. Cyclicals being dumped during a seasonally weak market period, but there is value here. Dupont is able to get through this tough period of pricing, shortages, and inflation and continue to grow its equity. It is only a little of 1x Price/book. Real value here and pricing power"
I don't really understand what is happening with the buyback but is there a chance we may see the stock go higher then $65.50 soon? Thank you very much
Can you imagine what this POS stock would have done with a miss?
"I read that in 2019 DWDP will split into 3 companies (Corteva, Dow, and Dupont). I've also read that the spin-off tends to beat the market over the first 2 years. Even pre-split its expected to to earn 16% profit growth with shares trading at 12 times earnings for 2019. I'm considering buying a few hundred shares to hold long. Any advice?"
what will happen to our shares when the company splits into 3 companies?
DD down below 70. The analysts who set a one year price target of 92 must either be related to Breen or on drugs (in my humble opinion).
"dd shares tendered were more than expected, thus instead of a 0.7 ratio of dd to 1 iff it is 0.5 to 1 iff. better to keep dd in hindsight. premarket dropped 8% as a function of this rate, going up because investors understand that dd holders made the better choice."
Here we go again...down 1.87% on no news.
"Hate to lose a bundle, but cutting my losses if this gets back up to 60. Maybe that will happen this year, though I have my doubts. Thought about dollar averaging, but then I asked; why should I put more money into this POS of a company. Can't see this company doing anything positive, especially with the leadership currently at the helm."
"Breen: ""leading an explosion of shareholder value."" Market down 1%, DWDP down 2.25%"
"The Board and top management are accountable to the shareholders. Seems like many changes are needed. Too many people comfortable with their salaries, benefits and other perks."
"IFF conference call - Purchase of DuPont's Nutrition Business sale expected to close Feb 1, 2021, fo $7.3 Billion. What will DD do with this $7.3 Billion? Special dividend to shareholders?"

Stock date/value date/valueDJI 9/1/19-$27.22 9/3/21-$35.39AAPL 9/1/19-$112.01 9/3/21-$154.20DD 9/1/19-$73.54 9/3/21-$72.03Now that's leadership we can get excited about!
Is there an official x date for the breakup and the # of shares one will get for each share they presently own?
Sorry but I am still confused. I own 150 shares of DWDP. on April 1 I will get 50 shares of Dow but will I still have 150 shares of DWDP or only 100 of DWDP and 50 of DOW? thank you very much
"DuPont sold off the food coloring business..DuPont has divested its Natural Colors business, which is part of the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences segment, to DDW, The Color House."

"I would appreciate any views on whether or not to tender DD shares for IFF. Are insiders going to tender shares? Which company stands to grow faster after the exchange? DD will be more of a cyclical chemical company, while IFF is a non cyclical chemical company. DD will be more boom and bust while IFF should be slow and steady.All views regarding tendering for IFF will be greatly appreciated in helping me decide."
Just got 100 shares today. What will i end up with 33 shares at what price?
Turbulence has subsided and stock will be back over $70/share once earnings are released...hope everybody made some money on the dip in price? A Gift Horse...
"Finally !! The philipines do a thumbs up. ..CHICAGO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc has won the final international regulatory approval needed, from the Philippines, for a global launch of a new line of genetically engineered soybeans, U.S. seed industry executives said on Thursday."
"Ed and Mark, I am sure you are asking yourself how Alpha Protec, Lakeland and Other Tyvek(r) Protective manufactures using Tyvek(r) fabric are up anywhere from 20% - 300% in just the last several days and DuPont is down 4% while owning the technology and material/ market channel?"
"Here's the deal: They will give you $107.53 worth of IFF stock for every $100 of DD you give them. Sounds like free money, right? There is a BIG catch. They will only give you a maximum of .718 shares of IFF for every 1 share of DD. As of 12/31/2020 prices that didn't matter, but as of Friday's close, 12/15/2021, DD $82.34 and IFF $117.72, your $100 of DD (1.21 shares) will only get you $102.65 of IFF (.718 x 1.21 x $117.72) and that difference could shrink or even go negative if DD price rises relative to IFF. Large money flows have removed the ""free money"" aspect of this trade by driving up the price of DD relative to IFF. As a small investor I am staying away from this offer. The prospectus came today - a nearly 500 page phonebook! Plus I got 2 copies because I own a few shares of DD in my IRA and in my brokerage account."
I just received my 400+ page prospectus. I wish they would have given me the money it cost to print and mail.
"I took a 63 buck overweight position on DWDP a while back. It has been slightly frustrating from time to time, but at least a paid a decent div that I could reinvest while I waited for the Market to price this stock fairly. It's not there yet, but I think the market narrative on this stock has changed to the positive. I do believe this position will be worth at least 100 combined, within a few months of the 3 company split being complete, It will probably be much higher than that, but I am being conservative. In the meantime, I just keep reinvesting the div"
$109 to $74 Buffett was right about mergers RUN RUN 9/2017 to 9/2020 3 years and far from recovering our $$$$
This company needs better investor communication. It has to do a better job of communicating to Wall Street and defending a higher valuation. Why should this company have a lower valuation post merger considering the significant tax benefits it will reap?
I am a bag holder since the split ! I will be lucky to get back to even. The so called unlocking of value was instead an unlocking of losses for most everyone who bought into the hype ! Financial engineering rarely works!:(
I felt that this was going to happen today. Not sure why the sell off before the 3 companies split. Down so much I have to ride this to the end and hope for the best
Really losing ground post merger. -35% and growing 4+ years out. I saw RS91 but that’s a lie unless something happens quick
How many from the merger?

"Cramer Gives His Opinion On Zoom, AbbVie And Dupont (DD)7:19 am ET February 14, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintCramer would be a buyer of DuPont de Nemours Inc (NYSE: DD) at its current price. He sold his position at $86 and he is buying back right here.ME TOO."

"This thing has turned into the old shell and pea game. We merge two companies, then make three, then do a massive REVERSE SPLIT. Rather quickly my 6,000. shares at $60. will be worth a few thousand dollars. I would like to take all of the board members and do something to them that would have been considered politically correct in the Third Century."
Congrats to DD. If the stock can gain another $.27 it will get back to where it was 5 years ago! What an outstanding accomplishment for Breen and his minions! They should all be very proud of this performance. I hope they all get the compensation they deserve. 
Bought 1000 shares today @ $63.15 / earning will beat and this time we will climb. Look at Monsanto over $100 and we're sitting here at $63 - Come on Man!
My biggest holding and it just can't even keep up with the marked. SAD for me!
Good article in today's Dow Jones News about evaluation of DWDP collectively and individually after the splits are completed. Broker and analyst Nomura values the combined companies at just $60 share but admits to difficulty of evaluating Corteva.
"Hey Greg..............you have pointed out some very sobering facts about value destruction under the Breen Leadership disaster. Your $109/share price is spot on for the reverse split that many are forgetting about, then you have to uncover what the DOW INDUSTRIALS have done since the same period. The DOW INDUSTRIALS have risen approximately 43%. Therefore if DD just kept pace with the DOW INDUSTRIALS the current price should be closer to $109 x 1.43 = $155. Here we sit at $70.90 with over 50% destruction in relative value of the once great DuPont Company. What is the Board doing to get quality leadership in place? I can guess that the family is not very happy? With the Dividend cut from what used to be $3.80/ share, I guess retirement funds and retirees are not happy. In summary.....relative stock price down 50%+ and Dividend down 50% I think many would want a do-over with Ellen."
"At some point, these companies have to provide some reason to buy shares, besides a dividend."
Seems to me that the original DOW and DuPont merger has only worked out to provide for a big pay out to the top executives and Board of Directors of both of the original companies. How this The executives and BOD can face themselves in the mirror is beyond me. The original owner of DOW have now lost several dollars a share and are receiving a lower dividend. Why are the shareholders not voting out the BOD and executives for the results of these poor decisions?
No news? Why the move up?
My cost based $98 at the merger falling hard after 5 years. A real failure telling investors a great move. In reality a terrible move for DD
I bought based on Valuelines Dividend portfolio thinking Valueline a safe bet no stop required. Very wrong thinking.
The eps and target $90 both look far fetched
Time to buy. Call options purchases have significantly increased. A major block of purchases. Suggests stock set for strong rise. Soon.

"I'm still confused. If I do nothing, what do I end up with for my current 85 shares of DD.What would I end up with if I tender them?thanks,"
Breen needs to buy more shares to break $60/share. Not sure why it’s stuck st this level.
"It looks like those two analysts who downgraded this stock this week from a buy to a hold should now upgrade the stock to a buy again since it tanked 8.5% since the downgrade. Shouldn't it now be a buy? Especially since their target price reductions were from $81 to 77 & $78 to 77, respectively. I never did understand how that warranted a downgrade since the target was lowered to a value that was still 7 or $8 higher than before the downgrade. Even with the higher projected raw materials this years earnings have only been revised down a few pennies to $4.13/ share. That is pretty excellent. What gives?"
"I know what I own.. Ive done the #DD and it is proving why I will most likely be correct as to why I bought the dips (I usually do not buy dips but average up during the up trend cycle)…. but with PKK/PKKFF/TNT… this one, Ive put away the charting.. and based on pure strong fundamentals Im strapping on my moon suit for another ride up to the MOON (AMC/GME moon rider here)… Dont get me wrong. im long on this one."
DOW is a better stock for the long term investor. Their dividend is double that of DD
"Q: What does February 7, 2005 and October 18th, 2021 have in common?A: DD stock price was the same at around $72/share.What ""outstanding"" performance by this ""wonderful, well managed, customer focused"" company!"
Analysts estimate for annual earnings = $4.30. Shareholders need a dividend increase.
Think the street already knows the numbers for second quarter will be excellent...
The short report has been a god send and the dip it created was another opportunity for those who have done their #DD and have already locked in massive gains. Love this
"Read THROUGH THIS YOU CAN SEE THE LIE. Promises that DD made out like bandits. IFF flys with the DD spin off. DD after DOW merger then this was bad for DD and Investors. After 5 years DD trading at $98 today $70. Today we can see IFF flying higher. The DD CEO is on the IFF Board. So there is more to this then meets the eye. I suspect DD CEO sold out the company for his friends at IFF. Probably getting a chunk of shares.

"what to do with this position? my cost in DWDP is $70 and i have 100 shares, now i have 33 shares of DOW"
I did read an article DD was a #3 adding to hedge funds. Not a huge position but adding. UBER and Dell 1 & 2
WOW - What an open - drove it down FAST - now recovered and gaining - looks good - maybe they took out some stops
Next earnings call will be interesting. Some reports that wholesale plastic resin prices have recently softened a bit...and couple that with the already known higher spike in Natural Gas prices going into this winter...both of which have seasonally pressured 4Q earnings but maybe just slightly more so this time. And then we have this whole tariffs/trade and global slowdown concerns.
Guess what the price of DD stock was when it closed on 3/7/2005!$77.62. Looks like shareholders are up $.38 since then! Yay!!!!! Now I can get add cheese to my hamburger!
In the summary link it says the analysts are predicting 118.00 one year target date hope they are right? We will all be happy.
Interesting comment:“Evermore Global’s David Marcus believes the combined pieces of DowDuPont are worth at least $100 a share and speculates CEO Breen may further break DuPont into multiple companies.”
EPS just above estimates and rev just missed. Does not seem like justification for down 7%
$98 cost bases at the DOW DD merger 4 years ago.
Never did recover from the merger with DOW 5 years ago. Lesson learned Buffett says run on any merger even acquisition. Tighten your stops. My cost based is $98.
"""F"" sounds like a ""bot"" designed to ""push"" stocks. Don't be fooled with these so-called ""day traders"". It's a good way to lose your money. Plan on a ""dollar cost averaging"" investing style in low cost index funds over your multi-decade career. You'll be very happy and comfortable when you are retired."
"Still love that unlocked value the merger and split provided to us bag holders. Made so much money from it, that I think I will run out and buy a matchbox car."
Bought ~1000 more shares today… also bought ~ the same lot # a few days ago when it bottomed. Peak has and is making me money based on my #DD and timing. #MONEYRUSH #p1p #capitalgainer #nobrainergainer
Forward guidance was just released. All division's revenues are projected to be down from high single digits to low single digits. Farmers are hurting because of floods and low commodity prices.. This stock picked a lousy time to split off. I'll wait until this bottoms in June
"I tell you, whoever dreamt up this merger deal, really stayed up late! Called a broker to see what I’d get for 500 shares of DD, at IFF.. He can’t tell me! Called DD, they can’t tell me, until shares tendered! Nothing but Chinese walls!"
"Just talked to company about Dow sin off...If you had 6,000 shares of DWDP..you will recieve an additional 2,000 shares of Dow. These are not deducted from you original holdings. You still have the original 6,000 DWDP."
"Finally something positive. Huge volume this morning. Sold a few shares prior to this report and bought LVS, AMZN, AVGO AND NVDA with proceeds. This is still my 2nd largest position and happy to see it is going UP for a change. Looking forward to split and further positive developments."
"i bet a lot of people taking a hit on this stock that did not sell when it went up to around $70.00 and did not sell. a lot of the people listened to CRAMER, and held on"
Explain again how stockholders who held on gained from this transaction? 6% hit this morning in it's stock
Never getn back to merger cost based. I sold the other two for gains. Looks like this one got pooped on
"Not a problem...DowDuPont (DWDP) today stated that the impairment is non-cash, reflects the effect of previously reported market conditions, and has no impact on its previously announced financial guidance for the Agriculture Division of DowDuPont for the full-year 2018."
Handwriting on the wall PE7 forward PE14.
when will dupont put news out on seed.only 3.7 million share float
"PE Ratio is decent and they make money, good entry point. Never understand how a company that makes a decent buck trades at a decent value, yet companies that havent turned a dime in profit....err lyft, get all the attention and trade at unrealistic multiples. Great entry point here"
"Does anyone know when this is scheduled to split up and how it would work? Like lets say i owned 9 shares of DWDP, would i get 3 shares of each of the new companies or would i get 9 shares of each of the new companies? thanks!"
"DD down 2.5% so far today. So much for the upgrade by JPM. It's hard to make ""garbage"" smell good."
