"cold is way over valued for a reit, yes it is has essential properties, but it's growth is awful...the good news is they expanded quickly using overpriced shares so they did get some value for that. But, until they can show actual growth and return on investments, this is not a reit to trade at 25x affo....most reits are at 13-20x depending on the payout (which cold is a laggard at 3%)"

"Americold Realty Trust FFO beats by $0.03, beats on revenue Q1 FFO of $0.29 beats by $0.03. Revenue of $484.1M (+23.2% Y/Y) beats by $6.7M. One of the best consumer staples plays you can find. Gets a slice of the action from producers and retailers. An absolutely crucial middleman that is physically impossible to “cut out”. Building a global footprint. Market leader in a fragmented industry."

Is it the cost of natural gas that is dragging this down. My understanding is that natural gas is needed for cooling so if that continues to move higher the input costs are driven higher for COLD

"What I do know about Americold, is that they are awesome to pick freight up from. (A lot of shippers can be a disaster)The employees seem to like their job, they work hard, the facilities are nice, they are always busy and they give out free coffee in Ontario.Oh, they are always on schedule too. Thanks ‘Mericold.I was not surprised to see linear growth."

The bulk storage segment (suitable for storing fruits and vegetables in bulk and extending the availability of other bulk materials) is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.4% through 2025.The main factor driving market growth during the forecast period is demand for automated refrigerated warehouses due to the increase in the trade of perishable products. Cloud technology, robots, truck loading automation, conveyor belts, and energy management comprise warehouse automation. “"

COLD was plugged on CNBC Rapid Fire this morning...tag line COLD is HOT! Lots of positive talk about the company and the cold storage space! Fast Money had a segment on it as well...I was buying this one in the 20s months ago and future growth is going to be HUGE ! Cold should be trading in the 60s soon! Look at my post a month ago on their earnings report. 
Any insight about this company and the industry? I have done and continuously reading about. But people in the field about the workings etc would help. Thanks.
COLD reached a 52 Week low at 26.02
stock will trade 20+ soon!
Everything I read about this company seems good... but why have they missed earnings 4 quarters in a row and what's with the PE ratio?
Can someone explain what's good with this stock?
"I actually work for these guys in Green Bay! They are not bad, but I don’t think I would put money in this at the moment because I don’t know how the cold storage market behaves. But if they add a stock-purchase plan as a benefit I would definitely get on board with that."

"Last day to sell before lockup expiration tomorrow, July 18. It will plunge tomorrow."
"Time to load up. Refrigeration space is in high demand with more and more customers on line ordering fresh food. It’s very hard to setup refrigeration storage and COLD is a few of them in this REIT space. Now it’s good time to BUY and by thdbencbof year COLD should be $45..,"
"why is this down? they missed earning per share estimate by 15 cents a share, they panicked and sold their growth driver - stake in chinese joint venture probably cent for a dollar ( good management would do the opposite, it is not high tech anyway why they sell? just tell you they are a bunch of idiots )that is why it is down right now"

"People want fresh food much more than packaged goods and even if it is delivered by Amazon or stocked by walk in grocery stores, Americold is the best in class facilities network in the US to provide the backbone for this societal change. Plus it pays a dividend! This kind of company is not a trade since it’s not flashy like a Tesla, but it’s solid, necessary and they are very very good at what they do. Look at their website. I will be getting more at this price point and holding long term for financial freedom."
