"So many here just to churn the special dividend... Sad really, there is a good/growing company in which the special div can be re-invested into more MCFE shares once the price settles ex-div date. BTW if you don't know EXACTLY when you need to buy and sell to capture the dividend and play the potential arbitrage you probably shouldn't even try, jmho. GL to those who hold for more than a few days/weeks."
Shorts covering b4 ex div. If this holds past tomorrow.....I’ll b a firm believer that this is now going to $50. Let’s go!!!!!
Can you imagine the upsell possibilities because the needs of the consumers will only continue to expand.
"Question about the special dividendwhat was the correct record day??? on some pages say that ExDate was 12.08. and so RecordDate 11.08.on other pages (also mcafee pr page) say 13.08. was RecordDateso, I haven't received it until nowbecause my broker says that I haven't had share at 11.08.thanks in advance for help"
Well... didn't know this was public AND a special dividend... YES PLEASE! Buying only a few though more to see where it goes in 5 years
"They should take 3 mil out of the sale and pay of the debt, the price of the stock will rocket to $80"
I love shortening this company 
McAfee is down 5.56% to 24.92
McAfee is down 14.43% to 26.75
Cramer has a beef with McAfee himself. this stock will probably go up.
MCFE reached an all time high at 19.98
amazing results
Long term hold for sure 
Opening was moved to sometime after 10 AM
They deposited the money in my account instead of reinvesting which is what I had asked for.
Hoping for above $20 soon!
"The shorts on this board are funny. They act as if MCFE didn't destroy earnings, increase divi and give a special one time dividend. This company mathematically will just keep growing. You must not understand their business model. They lay 5 dollars to receive 15 dollars over two years. Millions and millions of times. This is an annuity not a tech company."
"great day to be long from $15, just sold my $15 and $17.5 calls for Jan at over %300 and %450 :-)"
Cyber security is yuge. Buy and hold !!!
New Year...New Highs
Get ready for a lot of saltiness from impatient bagholders that dumped MCFE at a loss while it was finding support.
McAfee is down 4.93% to 29.13
30.69 nice
MCFE is up 10.90% to 23.50
I give it a week before
That is it. I am all in today. Last train. Waiting for lift off.Every news about this company is good.
Wait for the selling to be subdued and wait for 2-3 days of uptick to buy in. Who knows where the bottom is on this stock. Down over 20% this week and still moving down with no support.
$30&30.36 need to be broken.....excellent results. Congrats all for investing in a solid biz.
"assuming you don't sell, yes"
Is the stock price going to hold tomorrow?
"Almost 3X normal volume today on no news, maybe an announcement on the sale and special div coming soon?"
"Those insider sell was a part of the Sept. 14 block, which drove the share price down big time. It is all clear now. The market as whole is pretty wacky nowadays. Might be some good opportunities to accumulate."
"0,65 EPS vs 0,18 EPS estimated by analysts. Huge beat."
lmao intel sold nearly 6mil shares
good news https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/mcafee-asus-extend-exclusive-pc-135100526.html
is up 7.43% in germany!!
I bet this sale is from John McAfee’s holding.
how many hours into it until you start thinking its a scam just to pay their debt? Good timing for the company
"All this stock really needs is some institutional love + PR. One of the biggies needs to take a 200M position and it's hello 50. Until then, we are nickel and diming from 13 to 18."
4.50 dividends nice … no catch ?
this will hit $35 before ex div
Loading... Keep loading...
Solid quarterly results. Beating estimates on top and bottom line.
End of day run
"This thing should pop Friday at some point, earnings were very good and showed steady growth in revenues, it’s share price is at the low end right now, it’s rated as a BUY by everyone, at some point I’ll buy on Friday and watch this rise to the low $20’s over the coming months..."
60 dollar
"Bought at 18.97, started tanking directly after lmao."
If anyone can reply back to this but what is the mean reason why must of yall our holding onto MCFE?
Watch their Investor presentation. Slide 10: “Assume fully diluted share count of 470 million shares”. They have a lot of Class B shares who might convert to class A. MCFE has 168 Million Class A shares outstanding.
Really good to hold several cyber security stocks including MCFE which is undervalued. Plus A nice 2% dividend on this low priced stock.
"Any actual news on the dividend? I sold about 50% of my position at 28.5 and will buy back in before the dividend, but I'm afraid the dividend will hit and the price will drop back to 22 or something."
"I bought in at 31, so this is a very fun ride to the bottom"
"After McAfee IPO , i guess no one wants to participate any IPO"
What I want to know is WHY they had to announce this like some dilutive sale... why couldn't they have just started selling into the market?
Any way to check if there have been significant block trades done? My understanding is that it does not have to be in the open market?
Nice ER. Happy I held through the storm
Why this stock is still sitting such a low? They have millions of customers in fact every second enterprise uses McAfee. Inwas thinking of buying but wanting people to share their thoughts? When is the right time to get in?
"MCFE is named the leader in cloud security, if i am not mistaken. investor relationships mcafee, just google it"
bullish 60
"Who s smart s gonna short this thing into the gutter on the 13th, thank me later fellow 4pes."
People selling now think this will drop to below 26 after the exdiv day. Don't know. They will have cash and a solid business model. Slow burn upwards.
here we go
I bought 5 $30 calls this morning. I’m up over 100% because people are buying in to get this special dividend. It’s on WSB and a couple of other sub Reddits. But beware as many will sell after to take advantage of the dividend.
Dividend Distribition 1/7/21
I think the float and outstanding shares in McAfee is very small. This thing could fly soon to $25 before next ER report. True and tested mother of cloud security! Let’s roll!
Anyone knows when is the dividend payout? I haven’t receive mine…
So S/P closes @ $31.26 then opens the next morning @ $26.75 so the company sold or what? Thank you in advance.. Holding long anyway.
"MCFE gives you the entire story with how the market prices tech stocks. MCFE is being treated almost as a value stock because they 1. have a real product. 2. have real clients. 3. deliver a dividend. 4. are not new and make real money.An absolute mountain of stocks trading at 1000pe are just repackaged 90's software. They just happen to be popular. Here is a hint for all the people out there: In the tech world, popularity fades, but good tech always wins. I am not saying MCFE has great tech, but they have good, sustainable tech with millions of legacy users. Whales get big eating millions and millions of Kril. I feel very safe with this stock, but it should be higher. In at 15.80 and if it drops again, I'll sell the house and buy more."
Been here done that! Bought for special dividend then stock price drops and takes your dividend gain plus initial investment. no thank you I rather go to Vegas at least I can eat a good dinner
They closed development locations in Israel and Argentina... then they sold their business antivirus solutions. So what is left? Just antivirus software for private customers developed in India?
Hold on for a while and it will rise up 
awesome cup and handle forming. 25 by end of january
How high does everyone think this will go on the first day?
now we're back on the radar...
MCFE comes with every HP and Dell new computer. It's bound to grow. They have teamed up to provide security to the new computerized auto for hacking prevention and slowly but consistently grow.
Down -22% in the last 5 days… ouch!!
I’m in at $20.95 ( buy order placed )
$MCFE. special cash dividend of $4.50 per share
RIP John
"This stock is still a neglected Gem. All it needs is one upgrade from a trustworthy analyst, and off we go from ground level to space."
R.I.P.
$4 special dividend on its way.
I see $38 by Wednesday
"Our headquarters is now sold for $31.6 million. Capital Commercial Investments, Inc. specialities are all cash and 10 day closing. If I was them I would waive the 30 day commercial real estate due diligence. McAfee can easily get 41 million but might have to wait a few months longer. Anyway, there is a good chance that this shows up on Q3 earnings."
MCFE is up 8.94% to 20.95
"Hi All, I purchased some DELL and MSFT shares today, and saw a bunch of MCFE shares show up even though I did not purchase any. Now, I'm trying to sell them but they just won't go away! I'm getting messages that I'm at risk if I sell them, and asking me to buy even more. HELP"
"After doing some research (rolling the 8 ball), using the product (why bother, I use a mac), and researching the industry, I bought in at 15.70. I'll hold or add, but won't sell for at least 3 years."
Nearly time to sell your puts of you're looking to buy shares. This might go back to 16 or 17 at this point
today if we finish in the green it's the start of the uptrend.... here we go...
"One question though, does anyone know whether options strike prices will be adjusted downward since this is a special cash dividend and not a regular one?"
Opening at 950 AM Priced @ 20.00/share —- likely open at 30
"As a result, we are increasing our FY '21 guidance…folks that’s all we need to hear. This is a great company."
i hope stock price shall not go down after special dividend.
mcfee named best end point security company. this is amazing news to acquire new organizational customers
Supply and demand. Keep your computers and stuff safe with McAfee.
"They’re not the worst. They’re￼ tied for ninth in the top 10. US News. A new CEO with a focus on cloud and experience. McAfee is one of the few consumer antivirus software providers that also provides protection to an array of small, midsize, and large enterprise customers, including 80% of Fortune 100 companies, 87% of the world's largest banks, and 54% of the top 50 retailers. Reputation or not they have a huge presence in this industry that will undoubtedly create amazing new and improved versions of themselves in the future soon.￼"
Time to load up!
"Buy the shares by the 11th for the dividend, but its a one time event, and the company is also going to pay down a billion of debt. The TPG Team that manages/owns most of the company doesn't seem to be selling (check insider sales for Mcafee to confirm), which is the best indication of what they think.... Stock is up from $16.69 from year end. I own a decent amount of shares, but was the last person to own a flip phone so don't take my advice on the merits of the company (but i do have an MBA, so what I did write was accurate, but might not be helpful"
volume up. loaded another 200 shares. average buy price of 16.1 not bad
Let’see goo McAfee
Is this stock going under the radar or is it getting ignored
Solid ER report. Time to shine for MCFE!
This won’t fall below $20 imo. Looks dirt cheap right now. Fundamentals remain strong!
the downward movement today was due to loads of short positions being bought . stock will crash on ex dividends date
WSB boys are here!
"The figures and the (future) profitability look very good.Their balance, on the other hand: I can't get my head around it. Does anyone know what 'Preferred Securities Outside Stock Equity' is exactly? Looks like some kind of dilution that can take place. Looked in their 10K but it's not completely clear to me."
Any word on when that special $4 dividend is going to be distributed?
"2 ways to make a boat load of money on this bet ‘ buy this stonk before aug 12 and get the dividends and don’t sell , get wallstreetbets Diamond hands to buy in , and short will be force to cover"
Want to test something...If you are in this stock LT and going to hold AFTER the special dividend like this.if you are only here for the special dividend and plan to sell out after downvote.I'm curious how many people are only here for the special dividend
nice bounce today but struggling getting over $16---buypoint on daily chart is $16.39
MCFE is down 6.66% to 19.21
sheeeesh that pre market is 
No news and it’s up...this is good news!
This is a potential $20-30bn stock. That being said I’m going to wait until we hit $22 before loading up again
Did people seem to forget Intel OWNS THEM ? Do you think Intel would spin this off if it was still a mess ? Get real bashers ... LOL
Guys today is the last day to buy to get the special dividend. Last chance!
I don’t know why people thought this was a good stock. 2010 - Intel bought McAfee for $7.9B2017 - intel sold 51% of McAfee to TPG Capital for $4.2B2020 - ipo worth $8.6BThat means the company barely grew in 10 years. It also continuously failed to make profit for intel. Stay away !
Why it is red again :(
"why'd they even call this ""an offering""? BS."
I bought that at the real price of 21$ per share and a 0 profitability price of 21.11$ I am holding this stock till 25-30$ range minimum
Holding long term! It’s undervalued this stock. It will go up no doubt
Another one!! Neiman Marcus is notifying nearly 5 million customers about a data breach that exposed names and payment card numbers
I think 15.02 is its low--time to find a new high
"if you own the shares at 4pm today you get the dividend, The stock will most likely be down tomorrow by $4.50, hence it trades ex dividend.... I HOPE it goes to $50, because its my biggest position.... traded at $16.69 at YE, and has paid three dividends since then. I listened to the call yesterday, 3rd quarter revenue sounds good"
what was the earnings result???
Looks like all shares sold. Between $21.72-$22.50. Proposed offering was for $26.50 so we have a lot of runway here!
MCFE is up 5.17% to 16.68

Bought 1k @ 28.5 couple days ago. Locked in 4500 in divs sold today @ 28. Profit locked in even with a $500 hit on the stock. Good luck all made my week
MCFE announced that on or about Oct 8th the dividend will be payable $1.15 per share
why is this bumping? I sold covered calls for april at 22.5 - thinking of buying it back if this keeps running.
get ready folks . volume increasing . 800k in first hour . kabooom
"If shares are sold on or after the ex-dividend date, they will still receive the dividend."
"Dude. Who is shorting a virus stock that just IPO'd with solid earnings and rev? My guess is they are making VC vaporware cartel look bad. Sure, your stock is worth 1,000PE, of course it is..."
Hopefully this is it and it'll go north from now on.
lets go up to 17.50 next week
"And for any options holders, I can confirm that my platform is adjusting the strike prices...i.e. if you previously held an option with a strike price of $30, it is being adjusted to a strike price of $25.50"
In @ $18.63
Hi all I have a quick question. So the last day to purchase the stock to receive the dividend is on the 13th. My question is when am I able to sell the stock. Right after market close or is it a few days after the 13th?
This seems like an easy play for short term puts once the dividend date hits
yesterday was the bottom... we're starting the uptrend..
"McAfee latest investor presenation states Q3 outlook: ""Assume fully diluted share count of 470 million shares."". Currently There is 168 mln shares outstanding.Will there be some massive dilution or am I missing something?"

How in blazes is a IT company this old still losing $800m a year?
It must be going public from Hunter Biden's laptop.
Underestimated stock...
TPG sold about 6.5 million shares on Sept. 14 and still own 60 million shares. So it appears that they did get rid of all the 20 million shares at about $21.71. So it is behind now. NORTH!
So who’s selling tomorrow. lol
Buy and hold on way to $30
Quite achiever
Hedge funds are manipulating for entry point . Also retail needs to get in to increase volume .
My understanding is that option holders have to execute prior to the ex date (or sell the options)....like any other option
Anyone else excited for Mcafee to IPO?
"I am wondering why this does not move higher. THey just vented a total waste of a business for $3B! They now have a million upon million stack of easy pickings on the customer base that renews automatically and they can pay down debt and go buy their most tech savvy competitor. I'm in since 15 and I'll be here when the world wakes up to the merger of some of the anti-virus, VPN, SSL and security tech companies."

MCFE is up 6.57% to 20.59
When's the deadline to purchase shares for the dividend? Is it the 13th?
4.50 dividend!!!!
My losses with MCFE are minimum when comparing the losses of Intel and TPG. Hopefully they work on improving pricing.
Nothing to worry here...this will hit its mark and go beyond
"very sad, is it going to grow?"
"Glad I sold at 16.70.There is something someone in the hedge fund world is jealous about the performance of this stock. Someone is SHORTING to deceive the poor souls that run away instantaneous when stock goes down.Beautiful report, beautiful guidance, plenty of cash flow. They even said they pay DIVIDENDS SOON.So, why in the world is the stock dropping?! Buy the IPO price Now!"
im still holding from $15-16 range--I think this is a buy under $20 still
Nasdaq down today. Only reason this is down. Great stock to own. Oh btw earnings coming out. ^^
been holding since 15 with avg buy price of 16.4
"TPG/Intel/Thoma Bravo still own a huge chunk of this company (TPG with the largest piece). TPG's Fund is a 2015 vintage year so I am curious to know what their plan is (PE Fund's usually have lifecycles if 13-15 years). The fact that they haven't really sold anything is a good sign. MCFE will have effectively paid $5 in dividends since the IPO through YE. I wonder if they increase the dividend after the $1 billion reduction of debt (less interest expense).......this company seems to be on the right tract, and Intel didn't manage it correctly (same as with wind river)"
Anyone else here who didnt receive the special dividend?

Why are people selling it off right now?
They nailed earnings. Awesome. Special dividend. Regular dividend. I have nothing negative to speak of. Everything speaks for itself
"I only did a little bit of research, and I appreciate the dividend but MCFE does a lot. I expect their earnings to be insane."
what are everyone's thoughts here cant decide if I want to watch from the sidelines or jump in at open bell
INTEL sold about 10 million shares. So INTEL was one of the SELLING SHAREHODERS in the public offering announcement. They still hold 6 million shares after this.
"2nd IPO, no longer the best anti-virus software, troubled company, simply a brand name, ease of use. It seems as though purchasing anti-virus software is like shopping for a headstone. But will it eventually become antiquated ?"

"why is everyone so concerned with the special divi? It was announced months ago. This company beat earnings and rev, increased normal divi and future reporting shows increases to both going forward."
dividend should be in the next month or so.....transaction closed this week
in at 18.60 lets do it.

why it dropped down? any bad news?

I think this is a sleeper. The 1 month chart shows a steady climb up from here. I think traders will manipulate this as it goes up. McAfee security was on our computers back on windows XP. They seem to have enterprise and PC product lines. They just recently IPO. Their PEG is less than 1. Give it time. Hold. Cyber security is a growing industry.
McAfee? You mean the antivirus company from the early 2000's that turned your computer into a snail and held it hostage? No thank you.
Pumpers out today. Going to create more bagholders above offering price ($22.50). Short any price above $22.50 for quick gain. Then buy!

Just think. When investing. We think about what people need and use. Cyber security is utmost important.
"Sorry dudes, kicked this to the curb at 27. Nice dividend and nice jump, but there is no rabi on top guiding this. the big firms have kind of shunned it."
Boom! Investes the money from dividend. Easy money more shares
"McAfee MVISION Cloud protects data and stops threats in the cloud across SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS from a single, cloud-native enforcement point. A cloud access security broker (CASB) that accelerates business.The future looks great."
impatient holders are selling now and will likely buy back to secure special dividend in 3 months. Not a bad idea if you think earnings will disappoint which they are bound to because MCFE has few institutional backers otherwise this would be in the 50's by now.
no one talking about the new deal with Walmart??? strange. this is huge
Still time to get in on the dividendTomorrow
BOOM!
Do you have to hold stock to aug 27
They are shorting this hard now. Hold for a little squeeze.

"Public Offering of Common Stock purpose is a ownership shift.Here is what S&P Global wrote in regards to future upgrades. ""At this point, the rating is constrained in the near term by financial sponsor control. We would be unlikely to upgrade McAfee further absent additional public shareholding and a reduction in ownership by the TPG-led investor group to under 50% of the firm's equity and voting rights. Continued double-digit revenue growth, improving profitability, and further debt paydown such that leverage was sustained under 2x would all support an upgrade, but would need to be accompanied by further ownership shifts"""
glad i waited a bit this morning just started my position 140 shares at $30.9
I understand why they went low. They will have this sold fast and price will rebound faster.
I can feel the heat..
In order to get the dividend you need to buy by 12th August and hold it at least until 13th August 2021 5:00 p.m. Eastern standard time
If i buy extended hours can i still get ex dividend?
"hey MCFE fam, the AR sector looks ready to pop, NEXCF and IPNFF are the only companies selling AR as a product, huge potential for people who understand , GLTA know what you own"
"spike spking to get that $4.5 dividend. No matter where you buy, you will receive that amount. I think that is how they worded the distribution. That means anyone who wants 4.5 dollars for nothing should buy."
Lot of investors are asking this. “Until when I need to hold stock for the special dividend?” And answer it’s. Until 5pm august 13.
Check the after hours action! Block trading in action. Going north!
Hold boys. You want that $4.50 Not to mention this is a long play actually. As revenue and regular dividends will continue.

I think this is going to be like $PLTR. Trading at a low price now but eventually I expect 23-25 in the next few months.
I feel a lot of people will get burned and will no longer participate in IPO after this
All should have it by Monday. Tuesday the latest. Waiting on $4.5k. Need to get paid come on $MCFe don’t make us bring the pitch forks out.
Cha Ching
Under $10 in a few weeks.
18.61 is not even close to fair evaluation. This is a multi-billion dollar company that is all over the world but its dated and has a bad reputation. This company needs to go back to basics and the share price will reflect it. They have a crazy amount of debt but the industry is growing rapidly. Volume is picking up and there are too many hands in this for it to fail. Not the best stock but always good to diversify. I barely but any money but I am here at 18.85.
crushed earnings!!! Let’s go
Goodbye John.
Last day to buy in for $4.50 div payout on the 27th. Investors buying tomorrow or later will not be receiving divs.
"Ok going for it massive shares,, earnings great hold one month no big dill. I did not see no on coming to rescue"
Almost 20 million in volume and this is just floundering at 18.60.Strong pass
24% beat down in 5 days. -33% in a month. Reminds me of COVID affect a year ago. Sickening
