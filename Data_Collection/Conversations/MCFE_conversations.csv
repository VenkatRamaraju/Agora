"Public Offering of Common Stock purpose is a ownership shift.Here is what S&P Global wrote in regards to future upgrades. ""At this point, the rating is constrained in the near term by financial sponsor control. We would be unlikely to upgrade McAfee further absent additional public shareholding and a reduction in ownership by the TPG-led investor group to under 50% of the firm's equity and voting rights. Continued double-digit revenue growth, improving profitability, and further debt paydown such that leverage was sustained under 2x would all support an upgrade, but would need to be accompanied by further ownership shifts"""
Why it is red again :(
SP falling till the earnings
Any way to check if there have been significant block trades done? My understanding is that it does not have to be in the open market?
MCFE VS CRWD crowd has higher PE lower revenues higher number of shares outstanding trades $388 the only different is MCFE has higher debt go figure why is it $21.00?
"Our headquarters is now sold for $31.6 million. Capital Commercial Investments, Inc. specialities are all cash and 10 day closing. If I was them I would waive the 30 day commercial real estate due diligence. McAfee can easily get 41 million but might have to wait a few months longer. Anyway, there is a good chance that this shows up on Q3 earnings."
This could easily be a $20-30B company (so $45-55 per share). It’s not going to happen overnight but if you’re investing long term than you’re going to bag yourself a winner ;)
"As i said before, love shorting this company "
Wait for the selling to be subdued and wait for 2-3 days of uptick to buy in. Who knows where the bottom is on this stock. Down over 20% this week and still moving down with no support.
"Buyout target, No doubt! Norton and Avast teach... Just a matter of time and MCFE Will be bought for 35 USD at least, this Is the era of cyber crime and cyber security players are the right thing to buy"
Hopefully this is it and it'll go north from now on.
I understand why they went low. They will have this sold fast and price will rebound faster.

INTEL sold about 10 million shares. So INTEL was one of the SELLING SHAREHODERS in the public offering announcement. They still hold 6 million shares after this.
