"Longs: what do you expect in earning tomorrow?And afterward, will price go up? down?"
Multiple upgrades where the stock performance
"I read years ago, common practice of insurers was to automatically deny all claims. Make the insured fight for coverage. It seems to me, this company does the same #$%$ We've reached our maximum out of pocket so now they have to pay everything from here on but no, the bills start coming in, claim denied, no referral from primary care doc. Spent the weekend aggravated. Start digging into this morning and guess what? Referrals were indeed sent to UHC but somehow slipped through the cracks. We're so sorry says UHC. Yeah right! Like I said deny all claims, it's an old strategy. They can say they are endorsed by AARP all they want. This is a #$%$ company, can't wait to go on medicare."
earnings should help big time. isnt this just going down on speculation in politics?
"Why are all the directors exercising options and then selling all? Watch for the Hemsley sale, coming soon!"
adding...
Earnings will beat tomorrow. Big buyback and dividend increase expected. This will be back up 245-250 range end of week.
Look at the UNH chart over the last 10 years. There has not been a drop like this in 10 years or ever. This is either going to 0 or the best buying opportunity in HC services ever.
The company makes profits on the backs of physicians by denying claims payments
Today was to be expected. Hoping to finish the week above 233 tho
Healthcare stocks do better on average from May through September. Why the big drop today? Did universal coverage hearing today cause this 6 point drop???
I am disappointed to see the stock down about 7% from the post earnings bump to $360 following the reiteration of guidance and analyst price target raises. I suspect two possible culprits. 1. Fear over a resurgent virus if the mutant(s) strain takes hold. 2. Fear of a proposal by Biden that will negatively effect the biz model.
This stock is almost BeautifulIt has such nice constant growth ￼With a good dividend and fair valuation. Great fundamental Heath and overall I nice company
Best stock on the markets amateurs dont cares about.Hope we keep under the radar.CHA CHING!
Medicare for All is a pipe dream. The medicare system is already on the verge of running out of money by 2026. How is medicare for all realistic? UNH is a strong buy now. All the way back to 250 next week.
This is one of my buy it and forget it stocks. In my view a real super investment for the long run.
"Largest Health Care Company - 88% held by institutions - 25 points below 200 day moving average - EPS $12 - Dividend for those before March 11 - AOC roles out Green Deal - Republicans control congress minimum 21 more months - Take what you want to buy, make half that purchase today, reserve the other half for a cautionary short term future dip purchase, and go long.This has a 2019 climb ahead."
"Wow, look at those fund managers selling in to strength at every opportunity."
"Buy the best within their industries when they get hit hard. Did that with Facebook, Apple, and have been accumulating UNH up from the recent bottom averaging in. Money comes back to them. Don't go for the value rivals, the market doesn't. Political noise allows us to buy low, happens every election going back many years. UNH still off its highs of 286.85 offers value after posting positive earnings and raising profit forecast for the entire year."
What happened to UNH in 2019. Had a nice steady chart until then?
Get into heath stocks they said. Health is a good sector they said. Whatever.
"I find it amazing that a single person, Bernie Sanders can bring down the entire Health sector by pushing for a single health payer, the government. Market should always dictate the cost/price of anything in a free fair society. More government control equals greater taxes, paid by middle America. I wonder what happens when middle American dries up. We all we know shortly. I wish now I had worked in the Government as they hold all the cards for free healthcare, nice lucrative retirements, great pay (Sanders wealth is in the 1% go of Americans) and void of the laws they pass, they are exempt. Perhaps explains why we are seeing more illegals - it’s about the vote to keep one in office for life. Power money greed in our elected government officials."
Classic...McDonald's and United Healthcare both hitting new highs.

"THIS IS A GIFT-Healthcare is not going to change anytime soon. The target may be big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers but this will not hurt UNH. When drug prices go down, so do our costs. Optum has already announced that rebates will go to patients so we are proactive on that front. What is driving the price is FEAR. In my thirty years of investing I have learned that other peoples Fear leads to great profits. Be brave and ride this out."
"Medicare for all is impacting all the insurance companies. Not to mention all the software providers and any other healthcare segment company that will be basically put out of business by Medicare for All. Problem is Medicare for all isn't going to happen at least not in the foreseeable future. Can you imagine what would happen to all of these companies, the employees, the stock holders and so on. Healthcare is 20% of the US economy. Bernie and Elizabeth are not taking any of this into consideration. Not to mention how many trillions of dollars Medicare for all will cost. So, looks like UNH is going to suffer until and if someone besides this pair are the candidates for president."
"From Barrons: ""The stocks trade for an average of just 12 times projected 2019 earnings. And UnitedHealth, Anthem, and Humana already are generating double-digit growth in earnings per share. “Anyone who has a 12- to 18-month horizon and a value mind-set should be buying,” says Ana Gupte, an analyst with SVBLeerink. She puts only a “generous” 5% chance of Medicare for All getting enacted."" So the bill has only 5% chance and analyst is being generous. ALL NOISE brought by the media creates buying opportunities especially UNH having reported positive earnings beating expectations along with Raising profit guidance for the entire year!"
"As long as folks like Warren and Sanders are still theoretically a possibility, I don't see this coming back until after the election. I only have a token investment at this point."
"For what it's worth Morningstar likes UNH, calling it undervalued, from an article they published here yesterday: “Under one roof, UnitedHealth houses the largest private health insurer, a leading ambulatory care and health analytics franchise, and the soon-to-be second-largest pharmacy benefit manager by volume in the country,” notes Conover. “Cost advantages and network effects generated by the company's size and scope underpin UnitedHealth's wide moat and we think support its ability to serve clients at a lower overall cost than that of rivals. The result is enrollment growth and returns on capital that are nearly unachievable by competing firms.”https://www.morningstar.com/articles/950329/articleLooks like some profit taking today with the health insurers this morning, lets see how it goes..."
any guess of why there's been a significant insider selling over the past 3 months? I don't like seeing the chairman and a Lead director selling this much so close to the Q4 financials results scheduled for early this next Jan.
This is why its down $5 today. UnitedHealth Cut to Neutral From Buy by Citigroup
"UNH ON SALE-Doubling down today, feel downside is far outweighed by upside at these prices. For what it is worth called Mad Money today and am trying to get Cramer's take. Don't know what his opinion will be, but producers seemed very interested in having Cramer opine about UNH on the Lightning Round."
funny how this stock moved up by the same amount more or less yesterday with no big news
Boom! I've been a long term hold for over 10 years. Best decision I ever made.
Hold it forever... Medicare costs inflation coming
"What is everyone’s prediction for today? I’m a big shareholder and I think we open green, go red and finish up 1%"
"So they can't even get single payer passed in liberal states like CA and CO, let alone the entire nation? The Bernie herds may be loud but they are outnumbered by people with common sense."
One of the best health care stock that has consistency in earnings. On October 15 UNH will beat the earnings estimate again by at least 8-12 cents.
"I just read article describing this as ""temporary downward pressure"". Does anyone have a clue what timeframe Temporary implies?"
House Democrats are introducing a bill for Universal Health Coverage for all which would basically shut down all private insurance carriers. This is the reason for the sell off. I am loading up for 2 reasons.1. Universal Health Care for all is unaffordable and will never pass both houses of congress.2. If it were to pass Trump would veto the bill.
"April 18, $250 strike calls have open interest of 2,677. The money is on the market reacting to a good report and strong guidance."
The Bottom LineUnitedHealth stock looks ready to clear 2018 resistance in an uptrend that could eventually reach $500.
What is our catalyst for the next move higher?Analysts mostly agree this is 20% undervalued Medicare FA is in the rear view The recent reporting was solidDoes UNH have Covid?What am I missing?
This will be $300 by year-end
"A friend of mine used to say, ""listen to what the stock is telling you."" It's telling you fund money is leaving the whole group. Who cares if it's rational.........it's happening."
Thank heaven for UNH! I’m taking it on the chin in the broader market but my largest holding is keeping me above water....
"Looks like it will be a sluggish day, but to anyone whose here, $CVS is still - down 5.92% YTD ($CI up 13.95% YTD, $UNH up 36.57% YTD, $HUM up $34.22% YTD, $ANTM up 15.24% YTD)- CVS has the lowest PE ratio of all healthcare stocks of 10x to 12x- Coming off consecutive great quarters and going to finish with a great year- new CEO - heavily involved in Vaccine administrationPrice should be ($5.45 EPS ex $2 Div times 18 to 20 times) = $100For those that believe in $CVS, please hold your position and let's make today a good day.Honestly everything else ... energy stock weed stock tech stocks are already overpriced... investors need to recognize the value here and keep $CVS going up today."
Why is this down $18 in the premarket ?!!!!
"I have had this on a watch list for a while. I think that Monday morning I will be a shareholder. It's on sale, so I'm buying."
We love today’s steadily strong chart! UNH is heading north from here!
"Any thoughts on whether this is a good, long term stock to buy and at this price, with all the uncertainties of the healthcare space? Any advice is welcome."

"I have a sizable position (for me) in UNH built in the $100-$150 per share range. I'm thinking this downturn is only the beginning of a deterioration in healthcare stocks that will continue through the upcoming election and possibly beyond. I am not a Dem but I believe the ""Medicare for all"" stance some of the Dems are pushing will, at a minimum, generate extensive debate re the state of US healthcare. Almost all legitimate research shows that US Healthcare costs far more per capita than services provided in other industrialized countries and delivers relatively poor results. The healthcare industry including many physicians does everything possible to obscure the true costs of providing these services. I can't believe this situation is going to stand up well under a full debate. I am considering pulling the plug on all/most of my healthcare related stocks for these reasons. Anyone else as worried as I am."
Closed at 400.31!!!First ever closed above 400!
I have to say I find it astounding UNH is not up more given this news and the market up 600+ points. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/merck-to-seek-emergency-authorization-for-oral-covid-19-treatment.html
"How do you prove when something isn't a non-emergency? In many cases, you don't know until your diagnosed. I was feeling some chest pains...turns out it wasn't a heart attack, so we no help, lol"
"Buy UNH now because it is still on Sales now. UNH's PE is around 20 with dividends, earnings growth rate is over 25% because of great cash flow management. The most important thing is UNH beats estimate the last two years because of OPTUM."
A perfect combination when a company beats analysts earnings estimates AND raising outlook for the remainder of the year. The positive guidance is a green light to BUY for the investors as daytraders taking short term profits towards earnings release.
"Been a while since I have written but things are starting to look up. Have now built large position in UNH and have cost basis at about 240, so I am dead even at this point. I think this is still a wonderful opportunity and kick myself for not buying more at 210. UNH is best of breed in the HMO space. I have 30 years of experience as a physician and investor and I challenge anyone on this board to challenge me that UNH is not the best HMO. (Speaking as an investor, not as a patient or doctor). No other company does a better job managing care or costs. Period.HMO space has been unfairly punished by the medicare for all BS. Not going to happen. NO WAY. Even most dems shy away from the issue and it won't get past the current House. Political pressure now on Big Pharma, that's good for insurance cos.UNH has blown out earnings and revenue numbers on a consistent basis and raised guidance for 2019. Don't know what anyone else wants. Stock should be at 300 by year end and outperform the major indexes. Challenge anyone to disagree. Would love to hear other opinions and potential pitfalls going forward"
Which of the three have the healthcare knowledge? The other guy's job always looks easier till you try it.
This stock will see $475 before Christmas.
Punished for good earnings?
"Heading down to $391, the 150dma? Last time it broke below the 100dma it went down to and just below the 150dma."
will that after hours $2.25 show up tomorrow?
Crash .
Fundamentally..I don't understand the downturn in stock price
The low into the single digits held it back at the close. Good consolidation around $217. Likely to break through tomorrow.
"Elizabeth Warren has backed away from ""medicare for all"". Now, she's just looking at medicare for any that want to vote for her and that don't want to work with private insurers......that's the reason for the move in the stock price of UNH today.Since the democrats are now backing away from the notion of universality, based upon an inability to make the math work, UNH looks to be quite nicely priced on a valuation basis, considering where the market has moved in the last year and based upon UNH still selling quite below the 52 week high."
adding more...
"UNH to Kick Off What Investors Expect to be a Noisy 3Q Earnings Season on Oct 14th: There has been considerable fluctuation in COVID/Non-COVID utilization since UNH reported Q2. Still, we believe UNH took a conservative approach to 2H21 utilization, and we expect results to track or modesty exceed expectations. As important as Q3 results will be UNH’s commentary regarding 2022. The current 2022 cons est ($21.64) anticipates 15% EPS growth Y/Y, which is within UNH’s LT growth range (13-16%). In 2021, UNH is absorbing $1.80 of net Covid EPS headwinds. Some of this $1.80 headwind relates to MA risk coding, which should reverse next year. Still, given the ongoing COVID uncertainty and UNH’s tendency to guide conservatively initially, the company may take a more cautious approach to initial 2022 guidance. Our Q3 EPS est is $21.25 (14% Y/Y growth)."
"UnitedHealth: A Great Buffett-Style Blue Chip BuyApr. 17, 2019 7:00 PM•UNHSummaryI'm a big proponent of buying blue-chip dividend growth stocks when the market hates them most.UnitedHealth recently crashed to a new 52-week low, due to heightened (but likely overblown) regulatory/political risks.While regulatory/political risk is something all healthcare investors need to be comfortable with, UnitedHealth enjoys a wide moat, excellent dividend safety, and world-class management.Today, this level 11 (out of 11) quality SWAN stock is trading at a 1% to 26% discount to fair value and likely to deliver 13% to 20% CAGR total returns over the coming five to 10 years.Just remember that risk management is paramount, so keep your position size and sector exposure to reasonable levels. I and Simply Safe Dividends recommend 5%/25% position/sector caps for most investors.(Source: imgflip)After five years as a professional investment analyst/writer, I've learned a lot about what long-term investing strategies work well, which is why I've shifted my retirement portfolio (where I keep 100% of my life savings) to a pure undervalued blue-chip dividend growth approach.My specific approach is inspired by Warren Buffett's concept of ""fat pitch"" investing. That means only buying quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks, at good to great prices (estimated discount to fair value and preferably near 52-week or even multi-year lows), specifically when Wall Street hates them most.This helps not only minimize the risk of a permanent loss of capital (""rule #1 never lose money, rule #2 never forget about rule #1"") but also maximizes the chance of earning market-beating double-digit returns over time.(Source: Ycharts)Last week UnitedHealth (UNH) popped up on my watchlist after falling near its 52-week low. I set my limit orders and was thrilled to have one of them fill on Monday, April 15th, beginning a $2,000 starter position. During United's post-earnings conference call 10% collapse two more limits filled, tripling my initial stake while reducing my cost basis to $222.66.I would have bought four limits worth, however, that $6,000 investment in United Health raised my healthcare exposure (elevated after a total of $28,000 worth of healthcare deep value blue-chip buys in the last three weeks) to 21%, above my personal 20% sector limit.Thus, I'm now slightly overweight healthcare and will need to dilute down my portfolio with new buys in non-overweight sectors (anything other than energy, REITs or healthcare).So, let's take a look at why I'm such a fan of United Healthcare, especially now that it's 23% off its all-time high. More importantly, learn why Wall Street is so bearish on this blue-chip now, why those fears are likely overblown, and why I consider UnitedHealth a classic Buffett buy now. That's both under his famous advice to ""buy wonderful companies at a fair price rather than fair companies at a wonderful price"" as well as to ""be greedy when others are fearful.""Why The Market Is Worried About United HealthBlue-chips of United's caliber don't fall so hard and fast without the market being afraid of something. So, let's take a look at this health insurer's risk profile, so you can determine whether this dividend growth stock is a good fit for your portfolio.First, let's discuss the elephant in the room, and the cause of United's (and the entire health insurance industry's) big Tuesday intraday plunge. That was the result of what the CEO said during the latest conference call.The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best. And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs, all without fundamentally increasing access to care. The path forward is to achieve universal coverage and it could be substantially reached through existing public and private platforms. Meaningful progress in health care lives and national and state leaders continuing to work collaboratively with the innovative and proven private sector solutions to achieve the goals we all want, a modern, reliable, informed, and aligned health care system that offers the access, choice, and coverage protections people seek at a fair cost to the individuals and society as a whole."" - David Wichmann (emphasis added)What Wichmann is talking about is Medicare For All, which is the single-payer proposal first outlined by Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential bid, but that's now being endorsed by numerous Democratic presidential hopefuls.The impetus for Medicare for All is the belief that if the US government becomes the sole provider of healthcare then it will be able to extract drastic price reductions, either through bulk negotiations or outright price controls.

Should be back to new highs Bernie will lose big time too radical
Anyone gonna accumulate after Cramer puts target 261?
Well run company....continually beats street for years now. Usually raises guidance. Only 17 times earnings.... (very low). In with the longs!!!!!
"There is no doubt the current US healthcare system is heavily flawed. Americans spend twice as much as any other advanced country in the world for mediocre and uneven results. However, it seems that Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All has a few gaping holes in it. First of all we are talking about nationalizing about 20% of the US economy. Not sure that is something for this country. Also, what happens to the two million employees of healthcare insurance companies that will be out of a job. That is not to mention the companies themselves, such as UNH and the stockholders of all these companies. On top of that if there is only one healthcare system all the technology platforms and companies that drive them out there will be out of business too. Same story on their employees and the companies themselves. Also, cutting the cost of drugs from pharma companies by as much as 70% is bound to have a large negative impact on them. To accomplish this massive shift to a national healthcare system it would take a generation of shift as this could not happen in a short time frame. There are many more areas that would also be impacted that Elizabeth Warren has not addressed with her plan. On top of that it is probably impossible to get her plan through congress."
"This should hit 425-475, good for longer term investment, shorter term-415"
"UNH looks very good to me as a Pure Earnings Long play. I am planning to go Long tomorrow afternoon with a large chunk of hard capital, to hold through Earnings Release. I expect this company to deliver strong earnings, beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, along with positive forward Guidance, and I expect the stock price will react positively, climbing up through the $290's and perhaps breaking $300 on Wednesday. Company has an OUTSTANDING Earnings History. Analyze the past TWENTY quarters of earnings releases. Going back 20 quarters, they have beaten the EPS consensus estimates ALL TWENTY times. And Revenue consensus estimates?? They beat 18 out of 20, and the two misses were absolutely TINY, 0.1% or less on both. Such a record is rare, and speaks to quality management at the top, and excellent financial discipline. I like the sector, and this stock is currently fairy valued. It is not cheap, but if you analyze all financial data, you see the valuation is okay. There is plenty of upside potential to $300+ in the near-term, and every reason to think a very good earnings report can give us a pop very close to if not above $300. Analysts are currently very bullish on this one, and I see few headwinds that could result in a downturn following the earnings release. Risk/reward ratio looks to be EXCELLENT to me, as a Long play Pure Earnings trade, and I am 99% certain I will be making this trade tomorrow. Would love to hear from other traders with reasonable arguments in agreement or disagreement. :-)"
Who here is happy with UNH's 4+% gain this week?Show your happiness...Yeah!!!
Staying long until 4/16. 99% confident UNH will beat estimates again.
Down $40 (over 10%) from Jan. 8. following a solid report and solid guidance. What else can the reason be except uncertainty about what the Dems may do to the business model? Cuz based on the fundamentals the stock should be in the $360-380 range. All the HMO stocks are struggling for the same reason. HUM is $100 below its PT.

What is going on with the share price today?? Why the drop within seconds down over 6 points? Any one have any idea what and who sold shares or manipulated share price out of the blue?
Earnings beating estimates and posting Positive Guidance. Bullish. Good Luck
"All I will say is this... UNH has proven to be BY FAR the best large Health care company at navigating the risks and opportunities presented by legislation and regulation. I get why healthcare is being pummeled right now, but UNH is the place to be in the sector given the uncertainties."
"HOPE THE MARKET GETS ITUNH announced new policy today that as of 2020, all rebates must go to patients. As a physician this makes total sense. Patients more likely to buy and take their meds. This saves UNH big bucks when they can be treated as outpatients and not end up in overpriced hospitals and emergency rooms. This is a smart decision on part of UNH, good for patients and good for the bottom line."
Well i definitely bought this way too early at 227$. It’s fine though ill wait it out a long time

"From Credit Suisse on UNH's exposure to the moron's ruling. 'Specifically, we estimate HIX and Medicaidexpansion together are likely contributing close to 32% of earnings forCNC, 3-4% of annual EPS for ANTM, less than 2% for CI (pre-ESRXmerger), and less than 1% for UNH.""As we know UNH does not participate in the ACA exchange market so once again their exposure is next to nothing. So, while the EPS multiple will naturally come down along with the rest of the market UNH's earnings are not under pressure."

I wish I had sold off my UNH when it was at $265 a couple months ago. When it gets back up there I will. Same with my Fidelity healthcare provider mutual fund. Right now is not a good time to be in this sector. Better off with healthcare equipment and tech. It's a more consistent return in this political climate. I bought some IHI recently.
UNH has price target of $340. Not sure why people aren’t jumping on this now.
"This drop in UNH is way overdone, UNH should easily be $310 if not get back over $320 very soon. If this drop is due to concerns over ACA being knocked down in the Supreme Court is simply wrong. UNH and others will always be entrenched in administration of medical benefits for ACA, Medicare, or any other plan the republicans may replace.I do not think ACA will be dropped by the courts as this has been agreed law, and the payment mandate is already eliminated by the tax plan. The ACA will remain or be replaced by some other plan, either way UNH will be OK. Obviously if dems win, no more ACA concerns. In short, this is a buy down here and a big buy if under $290.....start adding here slowly!"
"Generally speaking I don't believe in accusations about stock prices being artificially manipulated to rip off retail investors. But what happened yesterday, in light on UNH's announcement today of a divi boost, is pretty remarkable. The market was up strong out of the gate yesterday so as a S&P component UNH participated, initially rising about $1.50. From that point it inexplicably dropped about $3.50, going red to the tune of almost $2 even as the market remained positive by around 200 points. Today it's looking to open around $9 above yesterday's intraday low. As they say.........there ought to be a law."

This would imply UNH shares getvalued at a blended PT multiple of roughly 14x.IMO, fear of the latter is why the stock is languishing around $330. CS has a PT of $415 on the stock."
"UNH should report stellar earnings. Quote : ""Strong Fourth Quarter RevenuesInvestors had more than UnitedHealth’s $226 billion in quarterly revenue, up 12% year-on-year, to appreciate. Optum’s revenue crossed the $100 billion level for the first time, helping to add to the $3.10 EPS in the quarter. UNH earned $12.19 a share for the full year, valuing the stock at 20.8 times earnings. Its 2019 EPS outlook for 2019 is even better, with net earnings expected to come in at $13.70 - $14.00 a share. That brings down the forward P/E to 15.3 times.These multiples are noteworthy because UNH’s revenue growth will likely accelerate at a faster rate, thanks to the positive contributions of Optum. In 2018, the unit only added modestly to results. Yet as UNH continues to dedicate itself to improving health and wellness, saving money for the customers it serves, profits will grow.UnitedHealth added 2.4 million more people in 2018. Full earnings grew 7.2% to $9.1 billion."""
Pre-earnings announcement run up now happening.
"Bought at 35 years ago, doing very well for me"
What a great stock. No matter where you buy it you know it’s going up. Seize the opportunity
The government will pay up for Covid visits. They made our largest healthcare system whole. It is amazing.
"UNH was cruising 250's waiting on earnings...and after earnings with the impressive full year profit guidance should've been a green light on its way to new highs. The tabloid media with bernie fantasies interrupted it breifly,... UNH back on course."
UNH has plenty of free cash flow to meet obligations. Analysts I have read don't really know how to analyze a high debt company with a high level of Goodwill to amortize. This is a buying opportunity as the company projects earnings of $3.30 a share for Q3 2018. Buy.
UNH is good to hold for LONG term investor. It is very sleepy if you are option trader.

"Here is what is comical about the medicare for all situation. Even if the bill could somehow pass (which it will not). You think the best run healthcare company in the world, with excellent management will not construct an agreement for a massive government contract? A government run medical system for all would be bad for small medical companies, not for UNH. Look at the defense sector for example. Do the best and biggest companies (Lockheed, Raytheon, Northdrop) not get all the money funneled right to them? Change or threat of change is bad in the market, but this is a homerun play long term, regardless of short term pressure."
Where did this thing close and why did it fall off the table at the close?
Another 52 wk high!!!Let's close strong...on the way to $400 next week.
another 52-week high today...just amazing.
"Cash $22BB, DEBTS $44BB, no thanks, INSANE BUY!!"
"Just another undulation caused by temporary risk off sentiment, and yes, overdue given the state of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with a lack of movement from the gov't on additional stimulus, this move was anticipated by many. Creating a great buying opp for us short term traders. Takes nerves to buy and take a hit, but the rewards come soon enough. The bump in GDP brought on by the consumer spending related to the first stimulus proves that it works for the medium term, and there will be another package coming. Meanwhile stock up on stocks while they are on sale. And don't pay attention to the punditry per the presidential election... unless of course you anticipate taking over a half million in gains, in which case I'd be taking it after the election if Joe wins. I believe there are some insiders at UNH that fit that category, not the least of which is the CEO and former CEO, but their sales would hardly be enough to move the needle."
"This should start to rise soon, just like CI."
UNH is a $500 stock in the next 12 months with a dividend increase from $5 to $6
"Dividend Announced: ""UnitedHealth Group Board Authorizes Payment of Quarterly Dividend to Shareholders[Business Wire]Business Wire•February 27, 2019NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors, at its regular quarterly meeting, authorized payment of a cash dividend of $0.90 per share, to be paid on March 19, 2019, to all shareholders of record of UnitedHealth Group common stock as of the close of business on March 11, 2019."""
"There will be more of this until we finally get single payer. Health insurers are just money changers - taking 20% off the top and doing nothing for it. It's gotten so expensive for ""real"" companies that self insurance saves big money. Add in all the money saved from actually controlling costs (i.e. deny unnecessary tests), and you have a winner."
"THIS MAKES NO SENSE-Nice beat by UNH, guidance was raised, best of breed company. The issue that gov't has with pharmacy benefit managers is that they keep rebates instead of giving them to patients. UNH has been proactive in this respect and is committed to giving the rebates directly to patients. Second issue is risk of medicare for all. As a physician with 30 years experience I am confident that this WILL NOT HAPPEN. Certainly not with Trump as POTUS. Even if democrats win in 2020 would take a 60-40 vote in Senate which is extremely unlikely. If by some remote chance that the bill were ever to pass, UNH will still be in great shape. The fact is that the government does not have the skill or resources to manage the care of 300 million lives. They will do exactly what they do with current Medicare Advantage plans. They outsource the lives to HMO's and pay a capitated payment(dollars per member per month) to the insurance company. UNH does very well on these plans as they can control the doctor panel , hospital payments and drug costs. UNH does this better than any other HMO. I know, as I had to deal with them for 30 painful years. They fight hard to control utilization and costs. At the end of the day, this is a great company with sound fundamentals. Don't know that the market really gets it. If you really think Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren will be our next president than sell the stock but odds of that happening are remote at best."
"From Credit Suisse..........A Favorable Outcome for the ACA in the SCOTUS Remains Possible According toSome Legal Consultants: As noted in the previous paragraph, four of the continuingJustices (Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer) have voted to support the ACA inprevious cases before the Supreme Court. Court watchers (and our key legal consultantregarding SCOTUS decisions) believe that Justice Brett Kavanaugh has a history ofsupporting the concept of “severability,” an approach that seeks to preserve as much of anexisting law, while removing only the flawed aspects (in this case, the individual mandate).ACA Exposure: We estimate HIX plus Medicaid expansion contributes roughly 26% ofEPS for CNC (post-WCG), 4% for ANTM, & less than 1% for UNH, CI, CVS, and HUM.CVS and HUM have no material public exchange exposure. Based on prior disclosures, weestimate low-teens percentage EBITDA exposure for CYH and 3-7% EBITDA exposure forUHS, HCA, and THC..........................................................................They estimate the EPS impact on UNH of a repeal of the ACA to be $0.11 or 0.7%."
"extremely low volume today with this drop, nobody selling at this level, holding strong. Good sign we will get to $310 and eventually new highs very soon. This ER will be the catalyst.......$310 leading into ER season, and great numbers will take this to new high. $330 is my prediction!!!!!"
Markets down on manufacturing decline. UNH not adversely affected by manufacturing decline. Should be considered a safe haven by many and perform contrary to the general market.
"We look for some additional developments around the Trump Administration’s drug price initiatives in 2019. Efforts to encourage greater use of generics and biosimilars are positive for MCOs, as are removing protected drugs and drugs classes, as these steps allow health insurers to negotiate better discounts and rates. On November 26th, CMS released its CY20 proposed rule for Medicare Advantage and Part D drug pricing. CMS is proposing to give MA and Part D plans the option to limit coverage of drugs from formularies in the six categories known as the “protected classes”. One of the tools proposed would be to allow step therapy, similar to the policy allowed for Part B drugs in 2019. This move underscores our view that insurers (and potentially PBMs) are necessary partners in their efforts to lower drug costs. CMS is also considering for a future plan year, which may be as early as 2020, a policy that would ensure that enrollees pay the lowest cost for prescription drugs they pick up at a pharmacy, after taking into account back-end payments from pharmacies to plans through POS rebates. If the industry is given sufficient time to put in place the appropriate bids (implementation after Jan 1 2020) and other mechanisms to reflect the new POS rebate scheme, we believe there would be minimal financial impact to health plans and PBMs. Further, to the extent that Part B converges with Part D, as some Part B drugs are allowed to be negotiated under Part D, it would allow health insurers to bring PBM techniques into the Medicare Part B program (which currently is unmanaged). Additionally, there will continue to be considerable focus in 2019 on any developments out of Amazon’s foray into the pharmacy space, as well as its JV with Berkshire and JPMorgan. Is"
"I've been running stock screens and looking for safety I ran one requiring a 5 Star/Strong Buy rating from CFRA along with an A or A+ S&P Quality Rating. UNH passed the test. It's also rated a 4-star buy by Morningstar and a Buy by Merrill Lynch. Current price of $205.58. CFRA's target is $352; Morningstar's is $304 and Merrill's is $345. Beta is 1.09 and short interest is .93. All looks good as well as safe but maybe not.....my concern is hospitals will be at full capacity but many of those folks may be without insurance coverage - either from getting fired/laid off from this crisis and/or from not having insurance coverage to begin with. Additionally, many smaller and even bigger employers may go under and no longer pay premiums and cancel plans. I'm not sure how big an issue this could be but it is one worth taking into consideration. Also consider many of these hospitalizations may likely be for critical care - ventilator-required, etc. which are typically very high revenue charges but - if the folks are on plans - UNH, Anthem or any other insurers will be strained for profits. I might very well be missing something so comments are appreciated."
"THIS MAKES NO SENSE- I am a retired ophthalmologist and dealt with UNH for most of my 30 year career. As a physician, they were by far the toughest HMO to deal with. They were always managing costs, fighting md's to use generics, etc. As an investor it makes no sense to me why the stock is getting hammered today. We are never going to get medicare for all in the next 5 to 10 years. It won't happen, no chance. Even if Trump loses in 2020 and somehow the Dems get it passed, the government is not prepared to manage 300 million lives!!!! (They can't even run the post office, how are they going to manage healthcare?) The reality of the situation is that if we ever do get medicare for all, the government will be forced to farm out tens of millions of covered lives to HMO's. In that case, they will use UNH. UNH makes more profit from their Medicare Advantage plans than anything else. With earnings just a few days away, only thing I can think of is a leak of bad news. In that case, think the stock is still undervalued at these levels. Reminds me of Fedex. They badly missed their numbers a few weeks ago, and within days the stock was back up. Am I missing something? Please let me know."
I just closed another position last night and decided to put all that money to open a position here. That is a hell of a welcome guys lol.
"MEDICARE FOR ALL is becoming a dead issue. I urge people to look at the polls and projections for the 2020 Senate race. It is almost impossible for the Republicans not to hold their majority. In fact, it really looks like they will gain seats. Worst case scenario would be 2025 for a major healthcare overhaul. In the immediate future, Big Pharma is a risk, not HMO's. Lower drug prices are a PLUS for UNH not a headwind. Wish I had bought more at 210. That was truly a gift. We should go to high 200's by end of the year."
this is why invest in chunks and add when opportunities present themselves; has the business changed? Medicare changes would be years away if even possible. I'll be adding.
PEG still below 2 along with massive moat from Optum given the health insights it gets from patient health habits and healthcare spends. Don't listen to posters who think healthcare for all will happen.

I'm sure we all agree now that the stock has come back a bit.......mostly because the S&P is up over the last 3 days..........that it's time for another negative headline to knock it down again. There must be something out there that can be printed to make the health insurers crater again.
Is this drop really due because just 3 companies are about to start offering healthcare to their employees? That effects probably about .01% of the people UNH look over....if that. Wow.

"The downturn is insane. First, we will not see single payor for at least 6 to 10 years. Second, UNH is best of breed HMO. Third, the most profitable portion of their business is Medicare Advantage.

Fourth, both repubs and dems support lower drug prices which will also create a tailwind for all the HMOs. I am long to the tune of 100 shares but plan to buy 1000 more over the next few days. Think stock could go down to 231 the Dec. 24th low, but there is support at that level. After that predict a trip up to 300 by year's end.

The crooked analyst downgrades UNH today. It is so funny that they downgrade a few days before earnings report. Let's see how the traders react to the news. UNH is very strong and number one in health care sector. It just increases dividends and buy back stock. I probably pick up some if the price going down over 5 points.
"Should i keep this one for the long run, or sell now before market bottoms again?"
I wouldn't be shocked too see unh back @ 250 today. UNH is on sale. Its a cash machine
"Risk is factored in the every stock's valuation. In the market's opinion risk to the biz model has increased and thus the valuation is being reset. Most importantly, as evidenced by the volume spike over the last 5 days, money is coming out of the group.....not in. Buyer/seller equilibrium will be reached this week for the short term but I'm not sure anyone should expect a big bounce. The stock is now headline driven, not driven by EPS."
"Just went Long 300 shares of UNH at $286.85. This is a Pure Earnings play. I am expecting a very good earnings release tomorrow morning, beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, to propel this stock up through the $290's and to the $300 level. Good Luck to All and we shall see what happens! :-)"
"Optum gains offset rising COVID costs for UnitedHealth, driving solid fourth quarter earnings and a robust 2021 profit forecast."
"So, on the one side there are reports that the large insurers are actually benefiting hugely from the cut-back of elective procedures. On the other side they are covering all of the COVID19 testing costs and much of the hospitalization costs and probably the vaccinations costs next year. In sum, will their costs go up or down? There is at least one report that premiums will want to go up as much as 40% next year but I couldn’t find wide consensus for this prediction. To complicate matters even more, the open enrollment period will start in the middle of the next election period and this subject will certainly come up – meaning politicians will buy votes by promising more government freebies (subsidized insurance premiums). UNH and ATHM are my two favorites that I will buy on the next DIP. Your thought"
ERs at capacity in AZ…would assume similar trends across US…high medical costs will impact bottom line just like CIgna
"If you watched last night's debate, Biden confirmed he would not get rid of private insurance, public option would be an addition only. This may not matter since he may not win the election. However, it removes the risk of the election on UNH, ANTM, CI, HUM, etc. And if Biden wins, Medicare Advantage will see large increases in business for UNH, CI, etc."

"Pisani on cnbc says, the Bernie Sanders rehetoric shook 10% off stock price last week but looks to be played out as UNH rebounding Strong 2 days in a roll."

Now what?
"""Why UnitedHealth Shares May Keep Moving Higher From Here""Jun. 11, 2019 7:17 AM ET| Chris Lau""United Health reported a strong first quarter that sent the stock higher since then. Services revenue shows promise of faster growth. UnitedHealth's Outlook, Even after UnitedHealth stock rebounded, investors who missed the rally may still buy the stock at a discount. At an adjusted EPS growth rate of 20% and enough cash flow growth to cover the dividend commitment, the stock has plenty of room to move higher."""
Why all healthcare stocks are down?
"Thank the ""Medicare for all"" goofs. They want higher capital gain taxes and you can see what it will do to your investments right now. Just look at this."
"Out UNH at $297.98 for an EXCELLENT gain of $3.4k. Another very successful Pure Earnings play, this one worked out almost exactly as I had hoped/planned/anticipated. :-) Now, gonna Short AA and go Long WNS. Split the baby in half and see what happens. :-) Best of Luck to All! :-)"
"As a consumer of various HMOs over decades, I can tell you that UNH has by far the best customer services. It made me want to research investing."
Look at a 6 month chart with the 50 dma. It almost always checks back to the 50 dma after a run. Fundamentals are intact. Back to $268-270 before the next report.
Tuesday will be big for UNH with earnings and just as important will be forward guidance. If it can go down $12 in a day it could pop up $12 on good earnings and guidance.
I worked for FHP in 1987 I started to buy at about 21.00 long story short after a number of acquisitions i ended up working for UNH I was able to retire very early thanks to UNH.
Patting myself on the back for adding 75 shares at 409.99 this morning.
Nice plug for UNH in Barrons. Could help start next week off in the right direction. https://www.barrons.com/articles/health-insurers-anthem-cigna-humana-cvs-unitedhealth-stocks-look-like-a-buy-51555698489?mod=hp_LEAD_1
"XLV down 1.5%, IHF down 1.17%, UNH down 2.27%, HUM down 1.71%, ANTM down 2.91%, and the S&P was flat. I invite anyone to explain why a sector with reliably growing earnings would be down in a defensive market."
"Sold 500 share Friday @ $288.50. Was in about 6 weeks, buying in for $224. That's a $64.50 per share profit, or ten bucks a share per week. Over 32K profit. Some taunted me for buying too soon right before the recent lows, and no doubt some will question the wisdom of ""selling too soon."" But I do that often and somehow my account is higher that it has ever been... go figure. I will likely buy back in on another dip. GLTA."
Tuesday is the day that hedge fund managers typically call the Snow Clown for advice. This week the Snow Clown recommended UNH.
Shares have been moving based on geopolitical situations impacted overall market direction and with earning 1/15 and reports seeing upside revisions should see $310 in very near future and $320 by Q2.
"We already have healthcare for all if you are 65. That system is going broke. The entire health care universe has to be addressed and corrected.Other countries pay considerably less and have better healthcare than the US. 20 years ago h.c. was not a problem. What changed? Executive compensation and corporate governance. All aspects of the hc system in the US are overpriced: doctors, hospitals, drugs, equipment, technicians, elderly care, hospice, ER care, ...."
Any bag holders?
"Doubled my position at $240, to have a cost average of $250. I believe this is oversold, and I will go down with the ship of I'm wrong."
Just curious: Won’t corona claims dry all profits?
"There is some commentary from CS I saw on the research page of my Schwab account saying there are questions regarding Medicare Advantage due to all the confusion over the pending legislation and what will get passed. That's my guess as to why the stock can't can't any traction. This likely accounts for the strength early today. SVB Leerink Starts UnitedHealth Group at Outperform with $480 Price Target8:46 AM ET, 09/27/2021 - MT NewswiresFrom CS.........Investor focus on Medicare Advantage: A big focus from investors has been around Medicare Advantage, and the question of whether rate cuts could be used as a funding source for the bill. Mr. Siegal noted that Medicare Advantage enrollees have increased markedly since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, and those enrollees make up a sizable contingent of the voting population for certain key senators, making any public cuts difficult politically. However, Mr. Siegal could not rule out last-minute cuts to Medicare Advantage as a way to fill funding gaps if the savings from drug-related provisions falls short of the total funds needed."
