"What a surprise all my posts on UNH misdeeds have been removed.Investigators at the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have said they're concerned that insurers with Medicare Advantage health plans might be using the risk assessments, in particular, to game the system.Whistleblower lawsuits have alleged that UnitedHealth Group and others have wrongly used data from chart reviews to boost Medicare payments — an industry-wide concern also raised previously by OIG.In September, an OIG report found 162 Medicare Advantage health insurers collectively received $9.2 billion in risk-adjustment payments based on two questionable methods companies use to document the health status of enrollees.Of all the insurers, investigators found that one company stood out from the rest — a company that covered 22% of all beneficiaries enrolled in the health plans at the time, yet received a disproportionately high $3.7 billion, or 40% of the total payments based on these methods."
"Eric, quit spamming the hell out of the board with your ""ideas."" Seriously, go get some help."

"UNH to Kick Off What Investors Expect to be a Noisy 3Q Earnings Season on Oct 14th: There has been considerable fluctuation in COVID/Non-COVID utilization since UNH reported Q2. Still, we believe UNH took a conservative approach to 2H21 utilization, and we expect results to track or modesty exceed expectations. As important as Q3 results will be UNH’s commentary regarding 2022. The current 2022 cons est ($21.64) anticipates 15% EPS growth Y/Y, which is within UNH’s LT growth range (13-16%). In 2021, UNH is absorbing $1.80 of net Covid EPS headwinds. Some of this $1.80 headwind relates to MA risk coding, which should reverse next year. Still, given the ongoing COVID uncertainty and UNH’s tendency to guide conservatively initially, the company may take a more cautious approach to initial 2022 guidance. Our Q3 EPS est is $21.25 (14% Y/Y growth)."

"It is shameful that health insurance companies are for profit !!! How do they make their money???........by declining claims??? Same with tobacco companies. It is immoral to be investing in them, period."
"Keep adding puts, all my out buys have been above 457 and some above 460. The dow is up every day hundreds of points so of course this is up too.Dow will crash next week. So will this. It will lose 20.00 next week"
"Any thoughts on whether this is a good, long term stock to buy and at this price, with all the uncertainties of the healthcare space? Any advice is welcome."
"An editorial in Anesthesia and Analgesia described aspirin for COVID as, “An old, low-cost therapy with a strong rationale.” And right on cue, it’s time for aspirin-bashing to commence."

Expecting analysts to adjust targets upward next week……$525 anyone?
Time to split?
"There is some commentary from CS I saw on the research page of my Schwab account saying there are questions regarding Medicare Advantage due to all the confusion over the pending legislation and what will get passed. That's my guess as to why the stock can't can't any traction. This likely accounts for the strength early today. SVB Leerink Starts UnitedHealth Group at Outperform with $480 Price Target8:46 AM ET, 09/27/2021 - MT NewswiresFrom CS.........Investor focus on Medicare Advantage: A big focus from investors has been around Medicare Advantage, and the question of whether rate cuts could be used as a funding source for the bill. Mr. Siegal noted that Medicare Advantage enrollees have increased markedly since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, and those enrollees make up a sizable contingent of the voting population for certain key senators, making any public cuts difficult politically. However, Mr. Siegal could not rule out last-minute cuts to Medicare Advantage as a way to fill funding gaps if the savings from drug-related provisions falls short of the total funds needed."
"UNH finally getting its day in the sun today, outperforming MOH ANTM CVS HUM WBA. Lets see where it goes from here."
I thought there'd be more follow through buying than this. Something is out there holding the stock down. Does anyone have any knowledge on whether negotiated Medicare drug prices hurts Optum? I think that proposal is dead in the water anyway.
this will be in $70 range in 5 years- buy and hold for long you might be able to retire.
"Some how, some way, eric must have bought/sold UNH at the wrong time and lost money."
Little opening pop is good opportunity to add more puts.Stock will see 440 in next 4 days
