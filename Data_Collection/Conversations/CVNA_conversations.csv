"Thoughts on HERTZ and CARVANA partnership ... the first was recently bankrupt, the letter will be soon bankrupt"
"Has anyone else seen the news that Ford is dropping their credit score level required to purchase a vehicle on a 72 month note, so basically a Drivetime/Carvana secondary credit customer can buy a new Ford now ""if they can find one "", this will have some affect on used car companies servicing the less than perfect credit score customers, I would think."
Some people successfully kill the puts at $280 and $285. It would be down day Monday. That is what my crystal ball says
"In an administrative hearing, the DMV accused the company of “failing to deliver titles to DMV, selling a motor vehicle without a state inspection, and issuing out-of-state temporary tags/plates for a vehicle sold to a person in North Carolina.”"
"Really starting to ""break down"". if some of the big institutional holders try and get out this thing could drop like a rock. In my opinion $30 is where Carvana should be trading and that may even be too high. Question is when, not if, it gets back under $50 a share. Just my opinions."
"Carmax needs to learn some tricks from Carvana! KMX beats the pants out of revenue estimates yet tanks over 10% because they dared spend too much on advertising and investing in AI and software stuff... If CVNA missed on EPS that way, they'd go up 10%!"
The good old weekly Friday pump to kill options traders on puts.
"Here is some simple math. I am using the top domestic used car sellers by UNITS listed for SALE. Units for sale. Carvana is way down on that list. I refuse to use units sold because much of Carvanas ""reported"" sales are to Daddy's companies. I do not think related party sales should count when comparing companies that are legitimate publicly traded profitable used car sales companies. #1 CarMax 396,181 units and 103 dealerships / service centers #2 Auto Nation 171,094 215#3 Penske Auto Group 129,652 145#6 Group One Automotive 70,475 100I have no idea how many cars Carvana has for sales because I do not trust any of FFFF's numbers.So here is the listed 4 entities profits per share for the past year and their CURRENT market capitalization:#1 CarMax $ 7.10 per share 11.46 billion #2 Auto Nation $11.46 23.0 #3 Penske Auto Group $12.00 7.8 #6 Group One Automotive $28.17 3.3Four used car sales companies with a combined per share profit of 55.87 per share, have a combined market capitalization of 44.5 billion Carvana, which just reported it's first quarterly profit since 2012 because of related party sales to its father's company......has a market cap of 56 billion. A large percentage which belongs to the company that Carvana sells cars to......Drive Time and FFFF."
The funds and their analysts and their $400 plus price targets at some point have to offload this on the retail investor. With all the bad press it's getting to be a tough sale!
must be playing ping pong again today between computers today
"Ahhhhhhhhhh.... So carvana is up on some smoke and mirrors story about how carvana is going to sell Hertz used cars.....At least they should have a title on these.......What a joke. This is not going to save this amateurish, terrible used car seller.Hertz Global Holdings Inc., fresh off a blockbuster order for 100,000 Teslas, reached an exclusive agreement to supply Uber drivers with electric vehicles and signed up Carvana Co. to dispose of rental cars it no longer wants"
I still see a 90% drop from this level ($300) to get close to fair value. Just my opinion.
"Wow. Stepped out of the mobile and went to buy gas and groceries. I keep being told the economy is reopening and that things are going to be in short supply. The only thing in short supply is my cash after buying gasoline, fruit, milk and eggs. When did the price of eggs double? As a result of seeing inflation clean out my wallet, I have decided not to buy a lemon from Carvana 20% over blue book value. I know it is tempting to buy from Carvana because you do not have to pay for state registration without a title from Carvana. But I do not see how I can pay for this overpriced vehicle."
"Carvana has had to pay many fines and penalties for not delivering titles to cars it filps for months. The fines have been significantly more then FFFF paid in his conviction for Financial Fraud in the Lincoln Financial fraud scandal. Carvana is now buying back cars for which it can not produce valid titles. I have always questioned carvana's financials as suspect, not transparent, misleading, and boarding on fraud. It will be interesting how they disclose and report the repurchase of cars they have failed to properly sell and title. Guess they will belong to drive time at the end of the quarter."
one hour 1/3 the volume who is buying from the seller it is not retail
""" A large"" numbers of puts on coming Friday are at $280 and $285. Some forces maybe collaborating to make those puts worthless. If the theory is true, there will be decline on next Monday."
"CNBC has an article about BBB complaints about CVNA. It talks about out of state license plate in CA and NC. The bad news is catching up. The only thing uncertain is how the market will interpret next ER. Tesla just gave a bad report but the market thought it was great. The stock rocketed. In the movie of Dumb and Dumber, the girl told the Dumb that he has one in a million chance to be with her. The Dumb got so excited about the chance. There are so many dumb and dumber in the market. That is why this thing worths more than Ford."
"This easily could be a double set up. Yes, the short interest is high. Supposedly one of the highest. But we can not get that information real time. But the crooks that control the trade have that data. Plus they have computer trading monitoring the option activity. And that is just a corrupt. I had a list of calls I wanted to sell, but the bid and ask action was just ridiculous. And you can not fall in the trap of chasing prices on options. That is for Robinhood gamblers, not investors trying to make money. And the most critical problem is all the institutions working together to manipulated the bid and ask on a very thinly traded stock. While this 60 point downdraft is tempting, do not get trapped, because the multi billion dollar traders can make a call and bid and ask this up or down to ANY price they want. No one is looking to dump this crooked stock. It has been crooked for years.....They are just looking for the next opportunity to rip off retail traders. You and me. I think the convicted Federal Financial Fraud Felon is on vacation and the hedge fund traders are at the Hamptons or down in the islands and that is why the stock is down 60 bucks in 15 trading days.....They could come back any day.....CVNA will one day trade at 50 or 60.......but they will make billions in the mean time. Hold your cards close because FFFF still holds all the aces and the institutions hold all the face cards......We are just playing fish with what is left in the deck."
I think this is a trap. The funds will run up the stock tomorrow like they did last Friday. But will fall again next week and eventually much more. Don't buy the puts expiring tomorrow.
"I did a quick, unscientific review of options expiring today. In my range comparison we are looking at 5400 calls against 5000 puts. The concentration of calls in in the 340 to 342.5 and the put concentration is in the 310 to 320 range. So, I am going to guess that this crooked manipulated stock will close right around the 310 to 315 range today. It has nothing to do with the fact that this company may be worth 50 to 60 dollars a share, and it has to do with the manipulation of the thinly traded stock by the institutions. Note: the high end of my price target for CVNA ($60.00 a share) is based on the projection that the 28 vending machines Tonka Toy Boy has put together like lego kits, will be sold and be transformed into koi fish farms."
"Yahoo shows CVNA ""Imied Shares Outstanding"" as 172.58M under the ""Statistics"" tab.Yahoo Footnote 6; Implied Shares Outstanding assumes the conversion of all convertible subsidiary equity into common"
Amazing. carvana stock up 5% after an article questions wildly fraudulent books and records. Gotta love the stock manipulation on wall street by hedge funds and institutions.

Was driving down the road yesterday and saw another Carvana truck picking up a recently sold SUV side of the road. This is the second in almost a week. What is going on?
"""Carvana"" search word trend on Google peaked at early June at 100. Now, it dropped to 85 this week,15% drop. It may not have a good quarter even in Sales. We will see."
"i have a 2021 cvr maybe crv honda 12,000 miles just offered 30,000 trade in paid 28,500 FEB trading for a 2021 Acura plus 11k what do you guys think should i do it cars are getting scarce"
Bad news hit the wire on the weekend… their customers aren’t getting cars paperwork some have to wait 6-8 months . I read somewhere that CVNA is probation in 5 different states.
"Found the Michigan article. Will try to post a link soon. They keep deleting my messages today. Especially the one about the BBB reviews.Consumers have filed dozens of complaints with state regulators and hundreds with the Better Business Bureau about issues that include incorrect paperwork, delays getting titles and registrations, and other troubles with the purchasing process. At least four states have disciplined Carvana or are investigating the company for violating vehicle-sales rules.In Michigan, the company is on probation after admitting to violating state laws including those governing title transfers and vehicle registration, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The company has been assessed $10,500 in fines in Texas for paperwork issues, according to a state website. These actions haven't been previously reported."
"I believe that articles going against common sense and reality, are just paid pumps. Carvana is not a top seller of cars yet it gets undue credit for being an on line techno wizzardy site. EVERYONE has on line presence and up and coming companies such as Vroom, TrueCar, Carguru, and others are doing a much better job then Carvana and do not have all the negative customer reviews that Carvana is building up. But, here comes daddy to drop a few million for positive press. These articles and Barrons are nothing more then advertising expenses to these stock sellers. Car sales are dropping off hard. I think the chip shortage is a joke. I drive around and there are cars everywhere for sale. Are the lost full? No and as long as you do not want high in demand modles, there are plenty of cars. The manufactures are trying to blame chips for their bad management. Speaking of bad management. The Carvana CEO every day looks more like a goof ball than a CEO. Good thing daddy is around to protect him."
"I am worried that this is a trap. The hedge funds do not give up tens of millions of dollars that easy when they completly control a thinly traded stock. I have showed the math before that for a small fraction of their holdings they can run up the stock and make 500% return on the net, net, net trades between other institutions and hedge funds. Be careful here. This is one of the more crooked stocks I have every followed."
"I have to question the writer in the latest Baarons CVNA article. I suspect he is bias to say now that internet traffic is running high. I read a recent article that contradicted this due to high prices and being now is not a time to buy a used car & the growth expected in the EV market. I am not qualified to write for Barron's but have to ask why the writer signals out CVNA internet activity when KMAX also has a fast emerging internet platform & everyone in auto resales is increasingly using the internet for marketing (Bias?)If one agrees this is a declining time to be pursuing used autos, how can one comment that increasing internet activity is a + signal for CVNA maybe I could have believed this 4 months ago.Due your own due diligence."
LAD up 25 bucks today good earnings looks like i shorted that one to early maybe CVNA will surprise one more qt and have good earnings
"Yes. Carvan is notorious for posting positive reviews. They have a PR director (Amy) that is responsible for not only posting to their self serving reviews on their web site, but also for posting positive reviews to outside sites. You can tell the paid reviews. One or two sentences and just gushing about how wonderful the process was. In turn the negative reviews are very specific and detailed about how bad Carvan is about delivery, warranty, returns, refunds, customer service, misleading presentation of vehicle condition, title problems......and the list goes on and on. This is the area to pay most attention to. If tonka toy boy can not sell enough vehicles to maintain cash flow, this will be the failure of carvana. I look at the numbers and do not understand how any fund or institution can say this stock is worth over $400 a share which would make it more valuable then multiple used car companies that are legitimately profitable. Last quarter, the FFFF financials claim that GPU jumped significantly to $ 5120. This is up $1464 PER car in just one quarter!!! Think about that......If the average car price is 24,000.....And remember, they spend $519 per car in advertising......How are they making over $5000 on each car sold? The numbers are impossible. This stock is a total sham. FFFF - you are a brilliant criminal."
"According to Google Trend, CarMax is search 30-40% higher than Carvana over last 12 months. CarMax search has been flat since the peak of March. Carvana search has been trending lower. It is 30% lower now than its peak around June. With all other information, we could speculate that the current quarter(Jul-Sept) could be weak."
"I thought you might like this from the largest non-Garcia institutional owner of Carvana... (see link below) note they are looking for $40 billion of revenues and 7% net margin by 2030.... that's $2.8 billion of net income, presumably, per year almost 10 years from now... at let's say an aggressive 20x P/E ratio, that's worth $56 billion in 2030!!!! And right now at $320 per diluted share, the market valuation is already $56 billion!. Does Baillie Gifford make a business of holding stock it believes won't appreciate for eight plus years?!? https://insight.bailliegifford.com/documents/institutional/ltgg-stock-slides/ltgg-stock-slide-carvana-ins-ps-9656/?name=ltgg-stock-slide-carvana-ins-ps-9656"
Fighting over it after-hours! 3 shares traded at current price!!
"Nice 50K share dump at the close. Sure it wasn't a hedge fund or MS trying sell before ""earnings"""
I noticed thousands of put contracts for Dec and Jan around the 100 strike price. Is this the funds hedging thier positions?
"Where do they get these numbers !?!?!? Carvana can not make a profit selling cars now, so in the third quarter of 2022 they are going to take Teslar cars that were rented by uber drivers for 334 a month and sell them for a 100 million dollar profit. How do they think anyone could believe this horse drops??? From the very start....I do not see 50,000 uber drivers paying 334 a month to drive a tesla that will have to be charged up constantly while they drive around for 10 house strait. Wells Fargo estimated that around 100,000 of Hertz's vehicles will be available for sale on the used market each year. Assuming Carvana sells half of these, and generates financing and other revenue of around $2,000 per unit, Kadem expects Carvana to reap some $100 million in incremental gross profit annually."
"this joke is so entertaining! trading share from one desk to another, writing and killing puts, but whenthe music stops look out!!!"
"Broader markets all down in the pre-market, but not CVNA it's up $5 in pre-market, all those retail buyers can't wait for the market to open to get their shares cheap at $287 HAHAHAHAHA"
"Someone MUCH bigger than Garcia II is getting out, at least partially, and they're fighting to keep it from tanking. End of day will be very telling"
"Here's my quick take on pricing: Looks like in August, used auto prices declined about 1.5%... meanwhile, wholesale prices continued to inch up. That's simply not great for Carvana although I guess it does mean they'll benefit more from purchasing directly from clients rather than on wholesale markets (where they can sell the lower value cars they purchase direct). But overall I just don't see how they come close in Q3 to the retail GPU they obtained in Q2... and unless they pull off a close to $1 billion more in securitizations before end of quarter (which is still a distinct possibility), their 'other GPU' probably won't be anything like the second quarter either. Not to mention that overall volume in the auto sales market has declined in recent weeks -- another trend that doesn't look great although it's possible Carvana could overcome that somewhat whit its huge advertising spend. So if supply constraints in the auto industry resolve themselves and new car volume production picks up (August PPI showed some softness, I believe), while consumer sentiment remains lower, then we could see some real declines in used auto prices... In meantime, all this rational talk doesn't appear to matter for CVNA stock price as it's at the whim of the traders... as evidenced by this morning's upside despite the negative CPI figures (though perhaps not as negative as some had expected)."
On Fidelity's order book there is a wide moat between the bid and ask. Bid now $285 and ask at $322.Is this indicative of the price discovery process that a larger freely traded float brings to the market?
"More bad news. If the activity of daddy FFFF does not run this sham company in the ground, the way they operate and the failure to have any sense of customer service and Secretary of State laws should. This guy made the mistake of buying a car from carvana in January. Dixon says Carvana stopped issuing those temporary, out-of-state tags in July of this year, but now, he’s having issues with Bridgecrest, the finance company he used to purchase the car.“I called Bridgecrest and they said they had no record of me. I couldn’t make a payment at all. Now Bridgecrest is calling me telling me I’m 60-days late for a car with no title, plates, or registration,” Dixon said.These alleged actions by Carvana violate state law, prompting the Attorney General’s office, on behalf of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, to file a lawsuit in Wake County resulting in a settlement agreement with Carvana earlier this year.“The department of motor vehicle oversees car sales in North Carolina and my office, the Department of Justice represents the DMV when they take enforcement actions against car dealers. The DMV had heard complaints from Wake County residents that the Carvana Raleigh was selling cars but not delivering title and tags, that’s against the law,” Stein said.The settlement agreement details several violations committed by Carvana, including failure to deliver titles in a timely manner. The agreement also characterized its practice of issuing out-of-state license plates an “unfair method of competition or unfair deceptive act.”"
just covered shares shorted at 312 the way the market is being pumped up cvna could go to 400
"Another try.....Had some down time, so did some shopping on the vending machine site to check inventory and prices. Little E had talked about electric cars and how he has to make sure the battery is charged up before delivery. EV is a big part of the future, Earn said. They have 377 electric cars listed out of over 26,000. Better plug them all in !!! So I used blu book to check the prices. Of the cars I checked today, every Carvana car was 17 to 24% over BB price. The on line average dealer price. Now it is great that they claim their profit per unit went from $2300 to $5000 in just one single quarter after being flat for 4 years......But I am looking at cars between $17,000 and $22,000. How they can possibly claim and get investors to believe they make $5000 on each unit sold. This claim is as trustworthy as felon dad."

"Every day......The institutions and bag holders come in and bid the stock at the open with a couple thousand shares and hope the false run up sticks. It is not working anymore. I am beginning to think there is nou much support for this crooked stock. You have to figure they will report a SURPRISE profit again to try to save this outrageous valuation, but I think it is nearing the end of its manipulative run."
"When Carvana could no longer legally issue a Florida temporary tag to Johnston after 30 days, he was sent a temporary tag from Arizona. That got him pulled over twice by law enforcement, who issued him a warning and told him his car needs to be registered to the state in which he lives. Johnston said Carvana offered to buy back his Infinity SUV and couldn’t tell him when he would get the title, despite the company continuing to promise “a few more weeks.” Johnston said no to the buy-back offer.“Due to your interaction with Carvana, I was able to get a legal temporary tag,” he said. “They have refunded me some of my money I paid toward two payments on the car because the car sat for 60 days unusable.For months, our Better Call Behnken investigation has exposed Carvana cars without proper titles and registration. Florida law mandates dealers provide titles within 30 days of purchase.We’re now hearing from consumers in numerous states with the same issue."
"The frustrating thing about carvana's shady financials, is that you can not check anything. There is absolutely no transparency or way to cross check numbers. And I now think that is by design. I am a big cash flow guy. I think that is the most important metric. But every time I try to cross check numbers for this company, I hit dead ends. Accountants tell me that with public companies, the accounting firms have to follow GAAP and the law. Hogwash. They make their fees by doing what they are told to do because there is very little risk in breaking GAAP. You can not tell me if FFFF tells them do do what they are told....that they do not do it. And that my investing friends, is the bottom line. A convicted Federal Financial Fraud Felon is running the show and I am convinced he actually does not know how to do it any other way."
"I'm going to call FFFF a total fraud. Seems he has figured out how to get Yahoooooo to block negative articles on his son's failing company. Hedge funds can control the price, but the complaints and bad reviews are piling up and Tonka Boy has no idea what he is doing. Seems there is a big problem in New York. New York requires that when a car is delivered, the title must be delivered. Carvana does not do that. It plays a temporary tag game. New York customers have been being instructed to accept delivery in New Jersey. Often times they are telling the purchaser to take an Uber over to New Jersey to meet the delivery driver. This has got to stop. And guess what? You see none of these title problem articles on Yahoo. I guess when you have cashed out BILLIONS in stock in your sham company, you can pay analyst for price targets and news services to surpress all the bad articles on your sham company."
"Remember I told you about a 3 year old Toyota with 70,000 miles on it that was listed for 17,000. I just got a message saying the price has been dropped to 16,590. Remember, I looked up the sticker price on this car and it was just over 19,000 brand new. This is why carvana has to sell cars to drive time. I advise everyone to try to sell their car to Carvana. My neighbor sold his leased Suburu to them and they gave him 5100 over the lease buy out amount. Tonka Boy will NEVER make a dime selling cars retail. Good thing daddy and Drive Time are there to buy all these overpriced lemons."

"A new deal is being touted by the bag holders of carvana stock as brilliant!!! Carvana, with the guidance of its partner in crime (litterally) prime time - drive time, has entered into an agreement with the Bank Robbers Association of Mexico (BRAM) to provide get away cars. The carvana CEO stated in a jail release, ""we are the perfect high techo wizzardy company to provide cars with no title that can not be traced for months and sometimes years"". Flood damaged cars and those with damage we can not cover up, provide the perfect get away vehicle for bank jobs and 7-11 Slurpee heists"". Little Ernie added, 'we will deliver the next day in Mexico even though we do not have a license because that is what we did in California, because we just don't care about laws. Daddy taught me that!"" EG2 added, ""even if you get caught, they ain't gonna do much. What's a 50 dollar fine when you are stealing millions"". Expert bag holders estimate this new deal will add 100 million dollars to the bottom line of carvana."
An article confirming what we all know. That the accounting practices and the financials of carvana are most likely fraudulent. How they operate with no cash is impossible. Daddy FFFF feeds cash from stock sales to make sure sonny boy thinks he is a CEO. GoooooogleCarvana: A Likely Earnings ManipulatorThe company is most likely an earnings manipulator according to the Beneish M-score and total accruals
"Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, et al working desperately to get Tiger and Rothschilds out (Spruce House)...."
"Carvana has a substantial negative operating cash flow (-$1,572.4 million), but yet it reports a lean operating loss of only $82.4 million. This suggests that the company has recognized 1,917% as many accruals as cash that has arrived, which beckons the question of whether it’s realistic to fill that gap.Even if one could trust its financial statements, how does it plan to make up those accruals and $154 million in accounts payable?"
"Retail sales report: Auto dealer sales down 3.9% from July after July was down 5% from June... not a great trend overall... much likely due to supply constraints, but when combined with previously reported decline in price, not exactly a positive sign for Carvana... particularly at a time when folks aren't just sitting behind their computers to shop."
"Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, et al need to keep it pumped past earnings so they can sell equity in order for CVNA to pay interest expense between now and January. $70 billion company. What a world..."
"It is likely a rally related to Tesla. Tesla rally is pulling up tech and interesting enough, this piece of stuff is deemed as tech stock. :)"
"This is what is frustrating about the paid pumping of stocks. Carvana has been on probation in the State of Michigan since MAY of this year and I have not seen one article on the negative news until last week. This is a joke company valued at 50 billion and manipulated by hedge funds and T Rowe Prices.Carvana on Probation in Michigan Since May After Settling 7 Sales Violations, Regulatory Documents Show Carvana Could Face License Revocation or Suspension in Michigan, Similar to North Carolina Sanction, Regulatory Documents Show"
Blockbuster expose on insider relations etc. on Carvana again from the Wall Street Journal. When an article like this is published in the wsj on how the owners Father made 3.6 billion on share sales it can and probably will start multiple closer in depth investigations on questions of just how Drive Time and Carvana interact. This is huge because it strongly suggests some type of interactions between insiders and company were not fair to the shareholders. More scrutiny is sure to come and when the finances are closely looked at the stock price could suffer greatly. Why the sudden halt of the fathers sales right before this article?
"An open question to Arcadia. You have accountants and investors here. We don't get paid by anyone, and we do not cow tow to any firms or CEO's or their fathers. I have to think other also have done significant research on CVNA. I personally do not trust ANY analyst to tell the truth, because that is not how they make their money. But I digress. Carvana, after 15 months of working up to $2000 GPU, in one quarter claims it went to $5000 GPU. Carvana reports what we call, questionable profits from their car loans. The reporting method is even questioned by their accountants in the financials. Constant, daily, BILLIONS of dollars of insider sales. None of these issues raise any concern for you? This is a 50 billion dollar valuation. More then the top 4 profitable companies in this sector combined. The father, a convicted financial fraud felon, is now the richest man in Arizona from selling the stock of a company that has not been profitable since going public. He sold 3.6 billion in one string of daily sales. Auto Nation has a market cap just over double what he took out of Carvana in one month of selling 60,000 shares of CVNA every single day!!! Auto Nation made $11.48 in profit just last year. Garcia, in my review of SEC Form 4's has cashed out over 17 billion. Plus he has dozens of shell investment companies and Drive Time and other companies he owns charges rent, fees, and what every he wants to service Carvana and manipulate the expenses and bottom line. Its a scam. And if you trust the analysts, tell me none of these issues are of concern to you."
Great opportunity to own one of America’s strongest and most honest family business startups at a Great Price!!
"Carvana the Attorney General, SEC and the FTC are getting ready to all meet. I am not sure why?"
Congress' action of increasing is a definite win-win. Deadbeat nation can pay its bills and social entitlements; dead beat CVNA car buyers can make their car payments. Why should this stock not go up today?
"Carvana is not giving out titles on Florida cars, either:https://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/better-call-behnken/four-months-after-buying-suv-from-carvana-riverview-man-still-has-no-permanent-tag-and-registrationhttps://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/better-call-behnken/tampa-bay-area-carvana-buyers-stuck-with-cars-they-cant-drive-after-dealer-fails-to-fork-over-titles"
"I reviewed Car Max's results keeping in mind that Carvana is in the same sector and how would their quarter effect the quarter for Carvana. Carvana has many of the same expense issues. But they have shady accounting and many related party transactions. Carvana posted its first profitable quarter and claimed profit per vehicle unit soared by 250%. I do not see it, and I believe it to be impossible to accomplish.....but you have daddy doing the books for Carvana. Here is what I see. Carvana is advertising heavy. They have new commercials with the working group and have seemed to move away from the techno wizzardy garbage. TV commercials are up and they now have a noticiable internet presence with those interrupting web commercials that pop up all the time. Carvana was WAY overpaying people to build inventory. They are continue to expand into markets that are small, they have been aggressively been hiring, they bought additional property and land......Their cash flow has to be negative.....And yet no additional funding has been mentioned. I think daddy is laundering money back into Carvana. Remember, he was cashing out 60,000 shares a day. What is a couple hundred million back to keep sonny boy thinking he can run Carvana. Bottom line......Carvana should post a true operating loss. But with daddy's accounting system, related party transactions, huge profits from bad car loan paper......You can not trust their financials or FFFF running the show."
"This is as of the end of the second quarter: Tiger Global Management LLC held the most valuable stake in Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), which was worth $1918.1 million at the end of the second quarter. On the second spot was Spruce House Investment Management which amassed $1196.3 million worth of shares. CAS Investment Partners, D1 Capital Partners, and Lone Pine Capital were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position CAS Investment Partners allocated the biggest weight to Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), around 42.43% of its 13F portfolio. Antipodean Advisors is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 33.66 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to CVNA."

"In Michigan, the company is on probation after admitting to violating state laws including tose governing title transfers and vehicle registration, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The company has been assessed $10,500 in fines in Texas for paperwork issues, according to a state website. These actions haven't been previously reported.Carvana didn't respond to questions about the state actions.Carvana declined to comment on specific customer complaints.This year through September, the Better Business Bureau has collected 899 complaints from Carvana shoppers reporting problems with the experience. That compares with 411 complaints recorded for rival used-car seller CarMax Inc. CarMax sold more than three times as many cars in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in February, as Carvana did in 2020. Carvana's sales pace has accelerated in 2021, but still lags behind that of CarMax.Carvana customers have filed dozens of complaints with state officials in Ohio, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, state records show. Many of the complaints are from buyers like Ms. Simmons who have been waiting months to receive a vehicle title, which is necessary to transfer ownership and register a car.""You always make mistakes here and there,"" he added. ""And we're built in a way to be able to absorb that as well when we're properly staffed for the volume that we're seeing, and today we're behind."""
Question: Could have yesterday's move been a manipulation to kill the $300 Puts?I have no experience in the options market.
"Leading car retailer in the world. Larger than Ford Motor Company, Stock hasn't traded in 20 minutes. Unbelievable fraud."
News !!! It’s bad CVNA is on probation in Michigan.BBB has collected 899 complaints from Carvana shoppers thru first 9 months this years .
"Sell off on very low volume , my fellow shorts , stay on your toes, I smell a possible trap ."
Watch Seth Basham interview yesterday on caravana and look at his face. He is reading from the screen. There is no conviction in anything he is saying. He started the campaign for stage managing the coming quarter results. According to Seth caravana will have better profitability per car than any other competitor because they buy 60 percent of their inventory directly from consumers unlike KMax etc. who buy wholesale at auctions. Then why is it that Kmax is a profitable company and caravana has been loosing money except for small positive last quarter that too because selling their loan book and not from actual car business. He raised from neutral to out performer and increased the price from 350 to 360. He Is hand in glove with hedge funds and Carvana management to fool the retail investors.
"I am guessing that it will only be a matter of time that these guys jumps ship "" The Shareholders Foundation, Inc."" I am only assuming that they are some very large holders or influence."
Dealerships in Michigan said no full lots of cars until 2022 fall
"In less then one year; after 15 consecutive quarters of selling cars for a loss, Carvana stock was up 135% from 160 to its high of 376 (August 10, 2021). More then doubled in less then a year. In two months, it has dropped 25% or 97.00 from that high. It had to create a profit last quarter after daddy made the NYP for selling 60,000 shares a day for a net of almost 4 billion dollars. Daddy seems to have stopped selling Carvana stock directly, but no one knows how many shell companies were created to hold shares for the felon. Down 25% in two months........What is next for this overvalued stock? Back to 160? Where it was one year ago? Still worth more then the top three used car sellers in the country selling cars for a profit and not creating the profit from selling car loan paper and lemons to drive time."
"I just put in a call to the Big Guy at the North Pole to make sure this Seth Basham guy is put on the naughty list. He would be better at delivering Carvana's eulogy then pumping up it's already overvalued stock. I think the highlight of the pumping came when he was asked about all the insider selling. He said, with his dry delivery, that it was all due to owner DIVERSIFICATION. Sure, from a sham stock to Florida real estate and Camen Island off shore bank accounts. So Seth Basham is now on the ""naughty"" list. And his book will never get released because like carvana, it will never have a title."
Does anyone have a theory as to why FFFF has pulled up on selling his CVNA stock?
"Schwab shows a before hours trade of 114,640 shares at $285.76, same as closing price; an unusually large pre-hour block. Other smaller trades indicate a $2+ opening."
"WOW this is huge, excerpt from the below linkThat’s not the only remarkable feat of corporate governance. As an analysis yesterday from Probes Reporter relays, Carvana disclosed a “voluntary request” from the Securities and Exchange Commission in an unrelated 8-K filing early last year, seeking information on related party transactions and accounting policies, including procedures for loan sales. The SEC confirmed on Sept. 2 that an “active and ongoing” investigation into the company remains open, though Carvana has remained mum on the topic. Probes Reporter John Gavin minced no words in assessing the situation.We are used to companies using clever wording and leaving things out when they disclose their SEC investigations. We [are] also used to them providing cut-and-paste repeats of earlier disclosures in place of substantive updates on SEC investigations. We see it all the time.But we cannot recall another instance where we saw a company make a stealth disclosure of SEC investigative activity; say nothing further about it for 18 months and then engage in massive insider selling during much of that period.We see images of rats fleeing a sinking ship. Holy smokes this makes sense now, beware people"
Jim Cramer said he likes Carnava when he talked about the next week's earning about Auto Nation. What he is smoking?
bigger market cap than Ford and can't even trade 1 million a day HAHAHA
"Any theories as to what is going on? FFFF has pulled up on his 60,000 share a day selling and the institutions have seemed to have stopped supporting his trades with bid ups on the stock. The stock is down $57.00 in 14 trading days (17%) and the analyst and all the pumpers putting a price target over $400 on this sham seem to have gone into hiding with FFFF. Any theory as to what id going on? Is FFFF done ripping off the market so it is time to get out of this stock, or is there something else going on?"
"Under the Uber agreement, drivers will pay a starting rate of $334 a week to rent a Tesla with unlimited miles, plus expenses for recharging and incidental damage. This is a joke. No one is going to be able to make money driving a rented Tesla for 334 a week. And to trust Carvana is a big mistake. Carvana has nothing but problems and is a very poorly ran company. The only thing carvana does well is insider stock sales."

"I do not see these big holders dumping their holding. This is a very thinly traded stock. You can not just dump a million shares in a given day. They instead will do their best to support the price with bid and ask manipulation of the trade. That is much easier for them to accomplish. They are stuck, they are really holding the bag and I truly do wonder if they are nervous as the bad press, the bad news, the problems they are having with titles and bad paper, are finally coming to a head.

"I was curious to see how Hertz, TSLA, & CVNA reported details on their Investor Relations - New Release. I could not find on any. I have no doubt on validity of partnership since Bloomberg reported. Just surprised not on 3 PP unless I overlooked.My guess is an overall positive to move from #2 to #1.Profits to CVNA? I understand commission to CVNA to use their platform. Was curious if commission type deal may lead to Hertz competing with CVNA's not Hertz inventory?"
"This looks like day 11 since CVNA has traded a mil shares. No retail volume at all, just the funds hoping to hold this up."

"I do monitor their prices. They are 2000 to 4000 more then competitors. I also do not think there is as huge a market for high risk credit customers looking for a car, which is Carvan's bread and butter customer. I am not getting as many ""we lowered the price on a car you viewed"" messages either. I think Carvana's inventory is way over values and over priced from an amature CEO thinking he can run this company. Drive time is going to have to buy alot of units to keep the profit farce going."
500k shares to drop $5 and only 100k shares to move it back up??????
"Stuck, you want a Yahoo Webush farce. The article""How Carvana will achieve profitability in 2023"".What analysis supported that title. Demand is good and they are hiring for reconditioning of Autos? My critique would be the title was intended to intentionally decieve & mislead."
"If there's an accounting scandal at Carvana, I wouldn't be surprised if it related to their inventory and cost-of-goods valuation... seems like easiest area for them to toy with. Gain on sale of loans is the other questionable area..."
Used car prices down for 2 months in a row.-1.5% in August and -0.7% in September. Given that data GPU profitability for 3rd quarter should suffer.
"CarMax post big increase in Sales(volume and higher price) but lower profit(even higher acquisition cost). We can speculate Carvana will do similar on the Sales side(to related part or not, haha). What about the profit side? Can they make another miracle or magical quarter?"
"Another thing I do not understand is why Florida continues to permit carvana to constantly break the law.Joshua J. says he grew tired of driving around the Tesla he bought from Carvana because it had a temporary Arizona plate. He turned to Better Call Behnken for help. But Carvana, he said, is now planning to buy back the Tesla and pay him $3,000 for the tint and audio system he put in the car."
"You can write a book on this sham. American greed will run a special when they expose Carvana and all its related sham companies created by FFFF. You have drive time billing carvana and manipulating carvana financials, you have Bridgecrest ripping off people that do not have good credit and have to buy from carvana to get a car. You have Silver Rock as a vehicle warrant program which has a one star rating and more complaints that you can shake a stick at.....And what do all these terrible companies have in common. A billionaire that is a convicted federal financial fraud felon. Just be patient as Sonny boy runs Carvan in the ground, but guess what.....FFFF will still be a billionaire."
Been a watcher of this company and this board for a few weeks now. I agree with a lot of the posts that something doesn't add up with the numbers. My only problem is why hasn't it blown up yet? What I mean by that is if we have all been duped and this is nothing more than scam and it is obvious than why does the scam continue to persist? Why is it that the news releases are still being released that the company is still trying to grow and purchase properties etc... You would think that buying properties adding payroll would only cause a scam to implode quicker and cause insiders to lose stock value faster.

"The bottom line on the Hertz deal is Carvana will deliver the vehicles in one of their broken down delivery trucks (I just saw one the other day and the side was torn off). Hertz has a better cleaning service then the one daddy's drive time supplies to carvana. They might make a slight profit on the delivery but I think not. Carvana has too many expenses to cover. Now if the finance and insure the car through daddy's companies they can resell the notes for huge profits, but who is going to buy an EV car that came from Hertz after an Uber driver beat the heck out of it? If uber drivers really agree to pay 334 a month just to rent the EV."
"""In May 2020, a lawsuit was filed against certain directors of Carvana. The plaintiff alleges that Carvana is controlled by the Garcia family. The plaintiff said that Carvana’s CEO, Chairman, and President, Ernest Garcia III, is the son of used car mogul and billionaire Ernest Garcia II, and that they together control more than 92% of Carvana’s voting power.""The SEC should file legislation that any company 'going public' should mean just that. At the IPO, controlling interest of over 50% should be in the hands of 'the public'. It is all so obvious, they are using the retail investor, with a small percentage of the outstanding shares, to create an overvaluation in the share price. They then proceed to gradually unload their shares for billions. It's all documented in SEC Form 4 Total buys 100,602,708 versus total sales 4,728,905,030."

Got dangerously close to that $300 mark . If we break thru that floor we are probably heading to low $200 soon . The sad thing is I was short 600 shares at $345 area and got paper hands and closed most of that position for a little profit when if I had just held firm I could have made a way bigger one.

"They knocked out some options this week. Easy money for these wall street thieves. All bad news, and the stock finishes the week up from $297.59. If that is not manipulation of a crooked stock, I do not know what you can call it.

But yet the institutions still support it and control the bid and ask all day long."

They found they couldn’t legally drive their vehicles, even though they were stuck making payments for the car and for insurance.“I’m paying every month,” said Michael Johnston of Treasure Island. “But my car is completely useless.”Wesley Chapel man says decorative curbing company damaged sprinkler system, falls short of finishing repairs Johnston turned to Better Call Behnken, fed up that after four months, he still could not register his new Infinity SUV in his name.The hold up? Carvana had not located and sent the title to the state of Florida.When Carvana was no longer able to legally issue Johnston another Florida temporary plate, he says the mega car dealer emailed him a copy of an Arizona plate and told him to tape it in his back window. That led to Johnston getting pulled over twice by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office.“When he pulled me over, I gave him all the paperwork. He ran this and said it’s not valid,” Johnston said of one of his traffic stops. “[The deputy] doesn’t even know why they would give this to me. It’s not legal either to have it in Florida if I am a Florida resident.”Johnston is the latest to turn to Consumer Investigator Shannon Behnken for help figuring out how to get their Carvana cars on the road legally."
"For a 50 billion dollar company. CVNA has the most crooked financials of any company in the market. 50 billion dollars and a 20 line income statement. That is because they hide everything and are not transparent at all. Drive time charges them rent, fees, charges, car detaliing and delivery......and they adjust the charges to control the bottom line. Company was never designed to be profitable. Company was created to make FFFF a billionaire. And guess what, he pulled off another financial fraud and the institutions support it. Thanks wedbush for letting us know you are part of the paid pumpers."

"After all the bad press and the exposure of the manipulated financials and the control of FFFF over this sham company, they are instigating a short squeeze. Just when you think reality will set in and the stock will fall, the big boys park their BMW's and begin trading it back and forth to run it up again. Manipulation is real and thriving with carvana stock."
$70B company. Largest auto retailer in the world. Doesn't have enough cash on its balance sheet to pay interest expense beyond Jan. 1.
"Just sayin maybe Ernie stop selling because he knew a down period was coming & subsequently anticipated short squeeze knowing this be the largest shorted stock. Wait, wouldn't some consider that insider trading on insider info?Do you think Ernie may have had some artificial help in pumping the price during his exit?Do you believe the reported finances & shortfall in disclosers of CVNA?Hey auditors: segment reporting is required if a business activity accounts for at least 10% of your profit. How about that securitization reported on receivables as a segment & yet recognized up front?"
Funny how yahoo leaves up a trade that PRECEDED other trades at much lower levels. Almost like it's deliberate.
"Carvana reported a magical profit last quarter where 34% of the profit was NOT from selling lemons, but was from selling bad car loan paper. Auto Nation reported a REAL quarterly profit. This techno wizzardy sham has a valuation over 50 billion so FFFF can sell shares daily. Auto Nation, which sells 4 times as many cars as carvana sells lemons has a market cap of 9.5 billion. AutoNation reported quarterly earnings of $5.12 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $4.20 by 22%. This represents a 115% increase over earnings of $2.38 per share from the same period last year.AutoNation reported quarterly sales of $6.40 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $6.31 billion by 1% percent. This is an 18 percent increase over sales of $5.41 billion in the same period last year."
"What drove this fraudulent company to such a high value ? I mean there is vroom and karmax doing similar business, why is there such high expectation from carvana ?"
"With all the questionable financial issues with Carvana and all the financial belefits afforded the garcias'......lets take a look at a very simple number. Since they started ripping off investors by going public and selling shares to themselves at a discount......Carvana started out claiming to make $1,000 GPU. Since going public in 2017 they were able to double the GPU to $2,000. Please note: this is assuming you believe their smoke and mirrors fiancials.....Now, in the last quarter, GPU is now $5,000. Talk about techno wizzardy. It took them years to double GPU. Then magically, in one quarter they up GPU by 250%. Amazing."
"Stuck: that article about Carvana being an earnings manipulator is interesting. They highlight how cash-poor they are yet Wall Street remains bullish. To me, that means equity offering likely ahead..."
Carvana just broke below $300.00/ share. I am not a technical person but is this significant?
It only takes 1 fund to decide they need to get out. Who's going to be left holding the bag?
"Warning: Carvana has become one of the top three shorted stock in the market. Fundamentally, it is a correct call. But when the stock is totally controlled by hedge funds and institutions that have billions at risk, this is a very dangerous short. The company is worth 60 a share assuming vending machines are worth a half a billion each.....but I smell a set up. Please be careful. It is a sham stock. No way it is worth 45 billion.....But it is a manipulated stock."
"I do not understand why any company would do that. First, 7 years is a long time to expect someone to pay on a car. If you are a high risk credit, you are a high risk driver and I bet you really do not take care of your vehicles. I know I am being whatever you cal it but this is a terrible idea for Ford. 7 yeas of car payments???It's not clear what the specific nuances of the deal are just yet, but if you're willing to take on a long loan term – 84 months or more – you no longer have to worry about a minimum credit score if you finance through Ford Credit. This means shoppers looking for a new Ford car, truck, or SUV may have more options than before, especially bad credit borrowers."
This manipulated stock was just upgraded by wedbush??? Based on what? Stock price manipulation by the institutions. Insider sales by employees and a greedy felon father??? How can they possibly upgrade this highly overvalued stock? There are so many issues in the financials. Just the fact that the father owns the accounting system should be a huge red flag.
CVNA is been on my radar for a while now.. I don’t like the fact that they purchase autos. Inventory has many risks and downfalls. EXPI is very similar to CVNA in the real estate world but they do not take possession of the house. If CVNA could model their business like EXPI they would have a winning formula. It’s working fantastic in real estate.
"WOW. I used other search engines such a Goog, and you get all the negative coverage and bad articles on Carvana. There are many and they are growing as this title issue and the condition of carvana cars decline. But when you use Yahoooooooo, you do not get the negative articles. Which is hard to believe.....well maybe not with FFFF.....but I used the same search and Yah is blocking all the negative carvana coverage."
"Interesting trading today. Opens way up and then drifts down all day with a sell off into the last two hours. Interesting. Can not seem to get any positive movement despite the trading of the institutions back and forth. Also, There was 8 SEC Form 4's filed on October. Including one from the CEO. Lets see if I can get away with calling him Tonka Toy Boy here. Rumor had it the owner of the Financial System of Carvana gave him permission to sell to buy a vending machine and a now Tonka Truck. Techno Wizzardy costume too for Halloween."
Carvana / ROOT same announcement as weeks ago (???) $126mm investment
the more some of these hedge fund guys talk about a market crash the more they pump up the market and have a bear trap us poor shorts are playing in a rigged market
is it me or is it used car inventory getting bigger in my town a couple of dealers look like they have more used cars if that is true does that mean business slowing up
Here is a warning sign. FFFF stops his daily selling.......and the stock starts to decline. 57.00 dollars it has fallen. Do you really think that him not selling and the stock going down is just a coincidence? I am more inclined that the down turn was part of a plan and FFFF is part of the plan. I think he works with the funds and there are kickbacks. Why else would they ignore him selling BILLIONS of dollars of stock while they hold the bag and artificially keep the price up so he can cash in at higher prices ever single day.
"Info on the ongoing Lawsuit https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2020/05/29/carvana-ernie-garcia-billionaire-lawsuit/?sh=69c1907a3b5fThe billionaire father and son behind online used car seller Carvana have been accused of insider trading in a lawsuit filed in Delaware by shareholders. The suit, first reported by Bloomberg Law, alleges that Ernie Garcia II, and his son, Ernie Garcia III, engaged in self-dealing, using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to buy shares at “bargain basement” prices even though they knew Carvana had “a strong balance sheet.” The suit was filed by pension fund shareholders in St. Paul, Minnesota, and also names the company’s directors and investment firms controlled by the Garcias"
"So they run the stock up 305.99 (up +14.43) base on the announcement that carvana will deliver the used cars sold by Hertz after Uber drivers rent them for 334 a week? Think this out.....So maybe in two years.....If all this really happens and Uber is still around after losing millions, carvana might deliver a hertz car in 2023.....If carvana is still aound......You just gotta laugh at this hype up story."
Who woke this sleeping dog today?
"Check this: CFO & COO were each granted 1 mil shares B convertible to .8 A at no cost, 200K A immediately vested & 13.3K of A each month. If held 4 Years @$320 = $256 mil each.Say 5 year hold & not so bad $50 mil per year each for COO & CFO in add to salary & perks.Now take Ernie II & III and we have multi billions in stock.$1 mil in stock per year was good for COO & CFO vs. $50 mil.A shelf registration could have added over $5 Bil at same dilution & raised $5 bil+ for co. & shareholders.And yet Drive Time has priority to operational income.OMGI trust this was adequately disclosed. Could have TR & MS overlooked this?"
Can you imagine the level of fraud occurring as the auditors prepare CVNA's quarterly numbers this quarter? Staggering.
us short are not going to make any money when it does crash we will have small positions or to scared to get back in
The smart money is going out. Now the question is if it will be an orderly decline like the last two weeks? Or we could see some stampede at some point. Its accounting department is probably in high stress now. Is the CFO sleep well? :)
"54,000 in volume on that last 1-minute candle and it's still headed south. That would have immediately moved the price +2-3% a couple of months ago."
"I am shorting again today, It is very clear that this company will crash and burn. The question is simply, when?My point of view on the stock price is that the people handling the market making for this stock have massive floats either directly in their portfolio or indirectly acting as a proxy for institutions or the Garcia family. In that vein, they uniquely hold the line and drive the pricing up from time to time. Sometimes corresponding with negative stories. When the price drops on news, it is usually short lived due to low volumes allowing the manipulation to continue. I am quite certain that as the ""brows are raised"" We are nearing 1 or more events that will torpedo this company. 1. SEC pressure or anouncement of a case.2. Bad quarter numbers which are due soon enough3. intitutions start to exit with NO VOLUME to suck up their stock to sell, this can be catastrophic. I think the institutions who were duped into buying this baaaad company will come to the realization that there is very little they can do to exit the position without destroying the price. 4. The unknown unknowns....I look forward to enjoying a nice $50 point easy slide down or worse in the near future. Volatile Stocks and futures usually tick up hard just before dropping even harder. Blessings to allLastly, I am terribly disappointed in what I believe this company is, it truly is changing my plans for a growth strategy for my own company. I suspect the amount of financial destruction and detritus this company will wreak on the marketplace will make it very difficult for a good startup company, like mine to find capital in equities or the bond market. Sadly."
just for fun i checked out the price of a used 2019 honda accord ex on carvana and compared it to a brand new one. guess what i found out? the brand new car is cheaper than the used car. unbelievable.
"All this terrible news about carvana. Dirty, damaged lemons, no titles, going to various states for temporary plates for customers. Customers getting pulled over, not able to drive lemons.

"One of these weeks, could be soon, I think we could see $100 down draft. Probably a reason the largestshareholder(founders dad) just got done selling something like $3.6 billion of stock. Just my opinions.Last opinion.... this could be a $25 stock in 6 months."
"And the hits just keep on coming!!! I purchased a car from Carvana it was delivered on 09-18-21. At the time of delivery, there was damaged noted in addition to the damaged they disclosed prior to sale. I was asked to take it to an auto body shop and the estimate came back almost $9,000.00. I had 7 days or 400 miles to return this car with no obligation. After I received the estimate I contacted them to have them pick up the car and refund my money. After hours and hours on the phone they are stating it could take up to 50-70 days to do so. I will be required to make payments on a vehicle I have notified them that I want to return it ASAP. They refuse to pay of this loan, return the check to the credit union and want me to return the car and then they will repay my loan. I feel all of this is very unfair and unjust. They failed to disclose almost $9,000 of body damage on this vehicle which I feel is dishonest business. This process is keeping me from buying something else and possibly without a car to drive"
I have no issue with Garcia selling his shares on schedule nor the fact he increased his automatic sales quantity. He did it legally and above board. The issue I have is that this should be a huge red flag that Garcia knows that selling is the smart move at this price point (just like GME and AMC floating new dilutive shares at inflated price--a gift I tell ya). Yet wall street keeps upping the price estimate and people keep paying up for a bloated money losing venture. Hope the shorts can stay solvent until the voting machine halts and the weighing machine takes it's place.
A year and a half ago Carvana was losing $2k per car and running out of cash. They did a secondary and on the next QTR announced that the loss per share was better than expected. The loss was actually bigger but divided by more shares. These same savey/sophisticated houses came out with strong buy recommendations. With the math I learned in 3rd grade I knew this was a scam. Since then the Quarterly reports have gotten more and more deceptive and the price targets higher and higher. Obviously trying to bet against this has been difficult so far......... I do believe the day of reckoning is soon!
Look for some anomalous block trades this week. Especially at the close. Likely Rothschilds (Spruce House Investment) exiting final position. Tiger Mgmt next.

"I have had a change of plans. If you can not beat crooks, you have to join them. I am going to take a job in the Crvana promotions department. And I have a new slogan which is peachy keen !!! And it fits with the times. To replace the Techno Wizzardy campaign, I have matched up the company with its product!!! In light of their inability to sell a single car for a profit unless it is to Daddy, and to reference their current vehicle inventory, I have come up with my new Carvana Slogan.Here it is:Carvana is here for you. Our cars are underwater so please buy one that has been underwater. And pick it up in one of our really cool vending machines!!!"

"So, I am doing a study on the inventory of Carvana and its partner in crime (literally) Drive Time. I think there are issues with the reported Carvana inventory. I was in Central Florida last week and noticed there are 21 drive Time locations in Florida. TWENTY-ONE !!! I had no idea how expansive fraud is in the Citrus State. There was a Drive Time near me, so I went to check it out. It was eerie. Although there was a handful of cars on the lot, I could not find any activity on the property. The building appeared shuttered. As I got out my vehicle, there was a strong smell of lemons...... But there was no smell of a Garcia vehicle sales person. Very odd. I found the same thing when I went to the Brandon, Florida location. I will continue to reconcile the Drive TIme site with the super techno wizzardy site of Carvana. This may be the biggest 60 billion dollar fraud ever. Get ready American Greed !!!"
"Going into manipulated losses for the quarter, I have upgraded carvana financials from suspect, to fraudulent."
