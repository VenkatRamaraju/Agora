"What drove this fraudulent company to such a high value ? I mean there is vroom and karmax doing similar business, why is there such high expectation from carvana ?"
"I have to question the writer in the latest Baarons CVNA article. I suspect he is bias to say now that internet traffic is running high. I read a recent article that contradicted this due to high prices and being now is not a time to buy a used car & the growth expected in the EV market. I am not qualified to write for Barron's but have to ask why the writer signals out CVNA internet activity when KMAX also has a fast emerging internet platform & everyone in auto resales is increasingly using the internet for marketing (Bias?)If one agrees this is a declining time to be pursuing used autos, how can one comment that increasing internet activity is a + signal for CVNA maybe I could have believed this 4 months ago.Due your own due diligence."
"Where do they get these numbers !?!?!? Carvana can not make a profit selling cars now, so in the third quarter of 2022 they are going to take Teslar cars that were rented by uber drivers for 334 a month and sell them for a 100 million dollar profit. How do they think anyone could believe this horse drops??? From the very start....I do not see 50,000 uber drivers paying 334 a month to drive a tesla that will have to be charged up constantly while they drive around for 10 house strait. Wells Fargo estimated that around 100,000 of Hertz's vehicles will be available for sale on the used market each year. Assuming Carvana sells half of these, and generates financing and other revenue of around $2,000 per unit, Kadem expects Carvana to reap some $100 million in incremental gross profit annually."
"This looks like day 11 since CVNA has traded a mil shares. No retail volume at all, just the funds hoping to hold this up."
"Thoughts on HERTZ and CARVANA partnership ... the first was recently bankrupt, the letter will be soon bankrupt"
is it me or is it used car inventory getting bigger in my town a couple of dealers look like they have more used cars if that is true does that mean business slowing up
Let's do some math ;)$ROOT $CVNA partnership x$CVNA stake in $ROOT x$HTZZ $TSLA deal x$HTZZ $CVNA partnership =$ROOT x 50

"A new deal is being touted by the bag holders of carvana stock as brilliant!!! Carvana, with the guidance of its partner in crime (litterally) prime time - drive time, has entered into an agreement with the Bank Robbers Association of Mexico (BRAM) to provide get away cars. The carvana CEO stated in a jail release, ""we are the perfect high techo wizzardy company to provide cars with no title that can not be traced for months and sometimes years"". Flood damaged cars and those with damage we can not cover up, provide the perfect get away vehicle for bank jobs and 7-11 Slurpee heists"". Little Ernie added, 'we will deliver the next day in Mexico even though we do not have a license because that is what we did in California, because we just don't care about laws. Daddy taught me that!"" EG2 added, ""even if you get caught, they ain't gonna do much. What's a 50 dollar fine when you are stealing millions"". Expert bag holders estimate this new deal will add 100 million dollars to the bottom line of carvana."
CVNA teamed up with HERZ .
Was driving down the road yesterday and saw another Carvana truck picking up a recently sold SUV side of the road. This is the second in almost a week. What is going on?
"And the hits just keep on coming!!! I purchased a car from Carvana it was delivered on 09-18-21. At the time of delivery, there was damaged noted in addition to the damaged they disclosed prior to sale. I was asked to take it to an auto body shop and the estimate came back almost $9,000.00. I had 7 days or 400 miles to return this car with no obligation. After I received the estimate I contacted them to have them pick up the car and refund my money. After hours and hours on the phone they are stating it could take up to 50-70 days to do so. I will be required to make payments on a vehicle I have notified them that I want to return it ASAP. They refuse to pay of this loan, return the check to the credit union and want me to return the car and then they will repay my loan. I feel all of this is very unfair and unjust. They failed to disclose almost $9,000 of body damage on this vehicle which I feel is dishonest business. This process is keeping me from buying something else and possibly without a car to drive"
An article confirming what we all know. That the accounting practices and the financials of carvana are most likely fraudulent. How they operate with no cash is impossible. Daddy FFFF feeds cash from stock sales to make sure sonny boy thinks he is a CEO. GoooooogleCarvana: A Likely Earnings ManipulatorThe company is most likely an earnings manipulator according to the Beneish M-score and total accruals
"In Michigan, the company is on probation after admitting to violating state laws including tose governing title transfers and vehicle registration, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The company has been assessed $10,500 in fines in Texas for paperwork issues, according to a state website. These actions haven't been previously reported.Carvana didn't respond to questions about the state actions.Carvana declined to comment on specific customer complaints.This year through September, the Better Business Bureau has collected 899 complaints from Carvana shoppers reporting problems with the experience. That compares with 411 complaints recorded for rival used-car seller CarMax Inc. CarMax sold more than three times as many cars in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in February, as Carvana did in 2020. Carvana's sales pace has accelerated in 2021, but still lags behind that of CarMax.Carvana customers have filed dozens of complaints with state officials in Ohio, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, state records show. Many of the complaints are from buyers like Ms. Simmons who have been waiting months to receive a vehicle title, which is necessary to transfer ownership and register a car.""You always make mistakes here and there,"" he added. ""And we're built in a way to be able to absorb that as well when we're properly staffed for the volume that we're seeing, and today we're behind."""
"I do not understand why any company would do that. First, 7 years is a long time to expect someone to pay on a car. If you are a high risk credit, you are a high risk driver and I bet you really do not take care of your vehicles. I know I am being whatever you cal it but this is a terrible idea for Ford. 7 yeas of car payments???It's not clear what the specific nuances of the deal are just yet, but if you're willing to take on a long loan term – 84 months or more – you no longer have to worry about a minimum credit score if you finance through Ford Credit. This means shoppers looking for a new Ford car, truck, or SUV may have more options than before, especially bad credit borrowers."
Amazing. carvana stock up 5% after an article questions wildly fraudulent books and records. Gotta love the stock manipulation on wall street by hedge funds and institutions.
Question: Could have yesterday's move been a manipulation to kill the $300 Puts?I have no experience in the options market.
"It is likely a rally related to Tesla. Tesla rally is pulling up tech and interesting enough, this piece of stuff is deemed as tech stock. :)"
Used car prices down for 2 months in a row.-1.5% in August and -0.7% in September. Given that data GPU profitability for 3rd quarter should suffer.
must be playing ping pong again today between computers today
$70B company. Largest auto retailer in the world. Doesn't have enough cash on its balance sheet to pay interest expense beyond Jan. 1.
"""In May 2020, a lawsuit was filed against certain directors of Carvana. The plaintiff alleges that Carvana is controlled by the Garcia family. The plaintiff said that Carvana’s CEO, Chairman, and President, Ernest Garcia III, is the son of used car mogul and billionaire Ernest Garcia II, and that they together control more than 92% of Carvana’s voting power.""The SEC should file legislation that any company 'going public' should mean just that. At the IPO, controlling interest of over 50% should be in the hands of 'the public'. It is all so obvious, they are using the retail investor, with a small percentage of the outstanding shares, to create an overvaluation in the share price. They then proceed to gradually unload their shares for billions. It's all documented in SEC Form 4 Total buys 100,602,708 versus total sales 4,728,905,030."
"How about this one - ""well now that we have this shiny new deal with Hertz, we need another billion in funding to pay for them"" (since we're pretty much broke), don't put it past them"
"I was curious to see how Hertz, TSLA, & CVNA reported details on their Investor Relations - New Release. I could not find on any. I have no doubt on validity of partnership since Bloomberg reported. Just surprised not on 3 PP unless I overlooked.My guess is an overall positive to move from #2 to #1.Profits to CVNA? I understand commission to CVNA to use their platform. Was curious if commission type deal may lead to Hertz competing with CVNA's not Hertz inventory?"
"This is what is frustrating about the paid pumping of stocks. Carvana has been on probation in the State of Michigan since MAY of this year and I have not seen one article on the negative news until last week. This is a joke company valued at 50 billion and manipulated by hedge funds and T Rowe Prices.Carvana on Probation in Michigan Since May After Settling 7 Sales Violations, Regulatory Documents Show Carvana Could Face License Revocation or Suspension in Michigan, Similar to North Carolina Sanction, Regulatory Documents Show"
just covered shares shorted at 312 the way the market is being pumped up cvna could go to 400
"Carvana has a substantial negative operating cash flow (-$1,572.4 million), but yet it reports a lean operating loss of only $82.4 million. This suggests that the company has recognized 1,917% as many accruals as cash that has arrived, which beckons the question of whether it’s realistic to fill that gap.Even if one could trust its financial statements, how does it plan to make up those accruals and $154 million in accounts payable?"
Fighting over it after-hours! 3 shares traded at current price!!
"Carvana reported a magical profit last quarter where 34% of the profit was NOT from selling lemons, but was from selling bad car loan paper. Auto Nation reported a REAL quarterly profit. This techno wizzardy sham has a valuation over 50 billion so FFFF can sell shares daily. Auto Nation, which sells 4 times as many cars as carvana sells lemons has a market cap of 9.5 billion. AutoNation reported quarterly earnings of $5.12 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $4.20 by 22%. This represents a 115% increase over earnings of $2.38 per share from the same period last year.AutoNation reported quarterly sales of $6.40 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $6.31 billion by 1% percent. This is an 18 percent increase over sales of $5.41 billion in the same period last year."
"There were two big sales today of 26.5K shares. I do not know if daddy is back to selling shares. Remember, I think he has several investment shell companies he uses to sell shares of carvana in additions to his SEC Form 4 sales. Still wondering why he stopped selling 60,000 shares a day after cashing out 3.2 billion in August alone. I also think he bills the $$$$$ out of carvan through drive time for rent, property, car detailing and anything else he can steal. All that is probably laundered off shore. I have calculated that he has cashed out over 17 billion in carvana stock but the institutions let it go because they have also made billions on this sham company. The option manipulation help pay the monthly BMW and tesla car notes and the weekends in the Hamptons."
"The bottom line on the Hertz deal is Carvana will deliver the vehicles in one of their broken down delivery trucks (I just saw one the other day and the side was torn off). Hertz has a better cleaning service then the one daddy's drive time supplies to carvana. They might make a slight profit on the delivery but I think not. Carvana has too many expenses to cover. Now if the finance and insure the car through daddy's companies they can resell the notes for huge profits, but who is going to buy an EV car that came from Hertz after an Uber driver beat the heck out of it? If uber drivers really agree to pay 334 a month just to rent the EV."
"i have a 2021 cvr maybe crv honda 12,000 miles just offered 30,000 trade in paid 28,500 FEB trading for a 2021 Acura plus 11k what do you guys think should i do it cars are getting scarce"
"Found the Michigan article. Will try to post a link soon. They keep deleting my messages today. Especially the one about the BBB reviews.Consumers have filed dozens of complaints with state regulators and hundreds with the Better Business Bureau about issues that include incorrect paperwork, delays getting titles and registrations, and other troubles with the purchasing process. At least four states have disciplined Carvana or are investigating the company for violating vehicle-sales rules.In Michigan, the company is on probation after admitting to violating state laws including those governing title transfers and vehicle registration, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The company has been assessed $10,500 in fines in Texas for paperwork issues, according to a state website. These actions haven't been previously reported."
"Under the Uber agreement, drivers will pay a starting rate of $334 a week to rent a Tesla with unlimited miles, plus expenses for recharging and incidental damage. This is a joke. No one is going to be able to make money driving a rented Tesla for 334 a week. And to trust Carvana is a big mistake. Carvana has nothing but problems and is a very poorly ran company. The only thing carvana does well is insider stock sales."
"So they run the stock up 305.99 (up +14.43) base on the announcement that carvana will deliver the used cars sold by Hertz after Uber drivers rent them for 334 a week? Think this out.....So maybe in two years.....If all this really happens and Uber is still around after losing millions, carvana might deliver a hertz car in 2023.....If carvana is still aound......You just gotta laugh at this hype up story."
"They knocked out some options this week. Easy money for these wall street thieves. All bad news, and the stock finishes the week up from $297.59. If that is not manipulation of a crooked stock, I do not know what you can call it. The financials are a total joke, and if you read the notes FFFF has put in the financials, you have to say, ""no way"". But yet the institutions still support it and control the bid and ask all day long."
"I really thought this balloon would pop, but it appears the air just may slowly leak out ."
