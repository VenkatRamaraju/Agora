Time for Sunpower to cash in those Enphase shares I think. Strike. ow whilst the world is in the midst of this energy crisis!!
"SPWR weak volume on Friday, taking a pause on the 200DMA support before ER's next week...Guessing Monday will bring bigger volume and then...Its been another great week, cheers and GLA LONGS!"
"SA piece on why solar names have been strong recently:• The gains came even after Senator Joe Manchin told the White House he would not support the Clean Electricity Performance Program in the Democrats' spending package that would encourage utilities to shift to clean energy sources.• Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne tells Bloomberg that other proposals that are facing less pushback on Capitol Hill may be seen as more important to investors.• Declining support for the CEPP ""doesn't appear to change any of the other initiatives at play,"" such as extensions of wind and solar tax credits, incentives for energy storage, and support for electric vehicles.• Solar shares ramped up last week after Chinese President Xi Jinping outlined plans to boost development of large-scale solar and wind projects"
"Well, SPWR is at least on ENPH and TTE payroll. Looks like smooth sailing. Averaging up with this chart. It is looking very healthy"
A break back above 200DMA @28.60 on decent volume could begin the journey into the $30’s…a bit of resistance and consolidation after a run up of of the 50DMA support range was expected…energy is in play! SPWR GO TIME!
Heading to fill gap open... sold everything at $33... will buy back on the gap fill...
"Well, I expected the commercial sale to push this to $30. Once that happens, its anyone's guess as to how high this trades. At least to RUN valuation, a double from here."
"The enphase numbers prove one thing....demand is huge. When a product has just 2.5% national coverage, the room to grow is exponential. Add to that the energy uncertainty created by politicians at home and abroad and it's just a breeding ground for continued success!!"
You realize it's just the beginning right?
Great to see SPWR getting real traction over the past month. Market likes the focus on home solar and divesting the commercial business. Let's see what happens with the ENPH call tomorrow. Big news today about the IQ8 finally available for pre order. I'm guessing SunPower will be a big early customer!
"SPWR resting, reTesting 200DMA and besting the opportunity to buy LOCK STEP into ER! Consolidation Creating sustainable support for next leg up…it just needs significant buying volume to get this running to fill Up Gaps headed to $35 range…"
Gaps are gonna get filled UP…and Patience Pays again…Where’s Doomboy now?
"SPWR owning 3.5 million of ENPH is large, $770,000,0000. large"
I've been long here since it was around $5 but have not bought new shares in ages. Have decided to buy more today with the company fully committing to home solar as a strategy. I think the market will like that as the commercial space has lower margin and lots of project delays etc. Also I think there are more chances to sell additional services for recurring revenues like VPP software etc. Following in RUN's footsteps here.
"Daily Reminder that the chip shortage situation is already priced in. It's been marketed as the largest fear factors for 6 months. ER will be solid. Like every other one so far, Q4 guidance will be the determining factor after all is said and done"
You'll get analysts revising price targets in the coming weeks probably to $45-50
Can you imagine the pop we get when a buyer for the C&I business get's announced!!
"Sunnova reported after the bell $69M rev (vs. SunPower consensus at $360M), 38% rev growth (vs. 32% for SunPower guided), $0.22 loss per share on negative operating margin (vs. SunPower at $0.05 profit per share consensus). Both have a market cap right around $5B. That checks out.."
"Big money is rolling in and SPWR is about to see asignificant run to fill those GAPs up as 2021 comes to a close... Strong move off of the 200DMA (potential ""cup and handle"" formation), but despite that strong underlying fundamentals about to be reported with Q3 and ramp up of the SunVault Added Storage side of Residential Solar installs due to EV adoption, rising cost of electrical bills due to high cost of burning fossil fuels, energy independence, an popularity of ESG investing...Basically SPWR is about to explode! In it to win it , PUMPER #1 Long Term Investor happy be holding large bag and 'patience' has been a blessing that has paid off very well...ENPH/SPWR/MAXN ""Solar Trinity"" (P.s. the Santa Rally gonna be lit!)"
"thedoomplayer keeps complaint about Spwr and it keeps rising from 20 to 34! Haha, please keep crying!"
Welcome to the alternative energy (universe) space where Tesla deserves higher prices and SPWR’s fundamentals leave only a squeeze to explain higher prices
"From an excellent new article on Seeking Alpha about SunPower: Read it quickly before it goes behind the firewall:ConclusionSunPower’s decision to let go of commercial and industrial solar and focus on the domestic rooftop solar PV market comes at a time of considerable anxiety about power supply. With the world embracing solar PV and wind power to exit fossil fuels, there have been hiccups in the transition and these won’t go away for a while. Having the capacity to self-produce power is attractive as is seen from the Australian experience where now one in four homeowners have installed solar PV on their rooftops and solar is making major contribution to domestic power generation. This also comes at a time when two further huge transitions are getting started. Firstly, home batteries extend the utility of self-produced power, while the looming electrification of transport means a further storage/access capacity (in their BEV battery) is coming for homeowners. There is an industry coming to help homeowners manage and optimise their power generation and use. Grid providers will almost certainly become part of this emerging transformation.The stars are aligning for SunPower. After a big runup at the end of 2020 and early 2021 when SunPower hived off Maxeon, SunPower has been in the doldrums until the recent announcements concerning the focus on residential solar. Over the past month the SPWR share price has risen 27% to trade above $28. There is huge anticipation about solar PV becoming the dominant means of electricity generation. This is perhaps best exemplified by Fatih Birol’s (Executive Director IEA) recent statement “I see solar becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets, …. Based on today’s policy settings, it’s on track to set new records for deployment every year after 2022.” Birol’s statement, taken together with the experience of householder solar PV making a major contribution to Australia’s power generation, why wouldn’t one get excited about SunPower’s new focus on waking up the US householder solar PV market?"
"idk but it seems like analysts consider sunrun to be better than sunpower, I strongly disagree. just a quick look at the books should make my reasoning obviously clear. lol. sunpower is growing revenue and profit margins, they own stock in enphase too (this reflects great on management). With sunpower focused more on its more profitable residential solar installation business, I foresee big beats on the upcoming earnings call."
My 100% gurantee is the low $40s gap from earlier in the year will fill in due time probably sooner rather than later!!
"ENPH has good growth, sun power has not yet hit that stage. If they show earnings better than expected it should go stable off hear and slowly move up as it grows. I have read that will not be the case this quarter. Next year is the game changer..."
Solar and home charging for all Electric Vehicles. SPWR is in the sweet spot.
JAN 11 2021 it was 31. JAN 18 2021 it was 47. So we know the potential exists.....
Let's see if SPWR Sunvault systems are also sold like ENPH.Pretty nice 2 weeks with lots off fun!
First solar hit a new 52 week High today. Let’s hope this helps SPWR to continue moving towards its 52 week high.
"Guggenheim Partners downgraded four companies in the sector; First Solar (ticker: FSLR), SolarEdge (SEDG), Array Technologies (ARRY), and Shoals Technologies (SHLS) were all downgraded from buy to neutral by analysts at Guggenheim. “We believe that risks to 2022 revenue and earnings outlooks are rising, notably in utility and large-scale commercial solar!!!No big deal..."
Eye on the prize...low $40's gap then new 52-week highs then $80+ next year!!
"Okay noobs listen hereI work for sunpower in California sunpower was known for their panels. Meanwhile, Enphase is it's own seperate company & is used by ALL solar companies. Now forget enpase (that's another topic/investment) In August, 2021 sunpower split into 2 companies. Maxeon & Sunpower. A head from sunpower became the CEO of this new 2nd company Maxeon. So if you owned sunpower before the merge, you got broken off with Maxeon dividend stocks. Maxeon now focuses on Solar Panels only. Creating panels only. Sunpower is now focused on the commercial aspect of sales only. They have been #1 in commercial sales since 2017. Lol before the split. Sunpower is also international yall. You need it in Canada, okay boom.Maxeon panels are made in Malaysia & Philippines but assembled in Mexico & France. So the panels are there for purchase too. There's jobs like crazy available in the states too"
New Enphase price target of 248 and it'll drag the entire sector with it. Sunpower will hit 50 before year end!
"Everyone here who is a serious long should listen to the Enphase call. Most bullish I've ever heard Badri. Demand for storage is huge and growing. And the IQ8 is a game changer that completely changes the calculus a home owner needs to make around buying a battery, something I had not fully understood. With the IQ8, if you live in an area where grid outages are pretty rare, you can buy a much smaller less expensive battery backup that will give you the resiliency you need at a much lower price point - and that is even more true now that you can add a generator as well. What I want to hear from SunPower is their strategy around the IQ8 and how it will change their storage strategy and options. If SPWR has the same strong growth in storage that Enphase is seeing, their revenues should increase materially. Not sure what the profit margins are on their storage solution. Anyone know?They are a close partner with Enphase - so how will they leverage that relationship with the IQ8? Enphase is doing great work on their software solutions for permitting, design etc. and these products are seeing strong growth amongst long tail installers. Does SunPower have competing software? Enphase is ""laser focused"" on the user and installer experience. Is SunPower?"
SPWR short interest up 1.3 million shares to over 16 million. The highest since April 30th.
"I have owned SunPower for a long time well before the split of SunPower and Maxeon. The things I still don't understand about Sun Power. If Maxeon makes SunPower panels and third parties install the panels .. then how does SunPower add value to the process such that they can make money? I know that they are starting to initiate value add services. But for now most of their business is installing panels.Also I know that commercial/industrial has lower margins. But if Maxeon panels are as good as they say (and getting better both from an efficiency and lower cost to install standpoint) then isn't fair to think that margins could get better. SunPower might see lower margins but they are the market leader with commericial/industrial. And again, they don't make panels and they don't install panels .. so how would staying with commercial/industrial slow up their increased focus on residential?Finally, since SunPower appears to be a ""solid"" and valuable brand name in the industry, what happens to the name when another company buys the industrial/commercial part of the business. It can't also be called SunPower. They will be loosing a valuable brand name with commercial/industrial. I hope Maxeon buys the commercial unit. It would ensure an outlet for Maxeon output. If SunPower margins on commercial are low, the Maxeon would be higher as they make money on panel manufacture. It makes the most sense. Or maybe Enphase. Just some question/thoughts. Any comments?"
"SPWR GAPS GONNA GET FILLED UP! $40's will be here for the ""Santa Rally"" Ho Ho Ho! (GAP to be filled $43.50 left from 2/18/21)"
"EnPhase - chip shortage significantly improving in Q4 vs. Q3. Expecting trend continues into Q1. Then, as soon as logistics bottlenecks are resolved, they will be able to fully meet (huge) demand."
Huge beat for enphase. That means two things. 1) SNPW will most likely follow and 2) all those shares that they still own in Enphase are now worth a whole lot more. Happy Days!!
After hours is still today last i checked..and guess which way shares are headed tomorrow.. thanks ENPH!!
