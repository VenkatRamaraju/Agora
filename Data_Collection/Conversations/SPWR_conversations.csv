"When Spwr finds a buyer for its commercial and manufacturing components, it will undoubtedly balloon in share price, just like it did when Maxeon came about. Focusing on the profitable aspect of the business, residential, is a huge, smart move. It should pay dividends, and so should Spwr, in the near future."

"""4.00% debentures due 2023"": - $425.0 million in debt - SunPower plans to pay off the debt until October 15, 2022 (a date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of ""4.00% debentures due 2023""), so the maturity date is January 15, 2023 - 2.5M of ENPH shares left as of now. - As per history of selling ENPH shares, SunPower can sell 2M of shares until 09/30/2022, and 0.5M after 10/01/2022. Looks like SunPower is allowed to sell every six months, starting from August 9, 2018 + a six-month lock up period. - To cover the debt, SunPower needs to sell 2.5M per $170 of ENPH share. Yet they have some cash, they will get some cash from selling CIS business (interesting for how many $m ?), and they will earn some money until October 15, 2022.August 9, 2018 (received 7.5 million shares of ENPH): 0) a six-month lock up period 1) (0.5 year) 04/01/2019 - September 29, 2019: sold 1 million of shares for $20.6 million 2) (0.5 year) 01/01/2020 - March 29, 2020: sold 1 million of shares for $43.7 million 3) (0.5 year) 04/01/2020 - September 27, 2020: sold 1 million of shares for $73.3 million 4) (0.5 year) 10/01/2020 - January 3, 2021: sold 1 million of shares for $117.0 million 5) (0.5 year) 01/01/2021 - September 30, 2021: sold 1 million of shares for $178 million 6) (0.5 year) could sell another 1 million between 10/01/2021 - 03/31/2022 7) (0.5 year) could sell another 1 million between 4/01/2022 - 09/30/2022 8) (0.5 year) could sell left 0.5 million between 10/01/2020 - 03/31/2023"

"SunPower Announces Acquisition of Blue Raven Solar call - https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/jo8cbs5hAs per Manu Sial: - Resi: great booking quater, good top of the final activity, they have managed the supply chain, executed well, business is strong. - C&I: business is lumpy, this is the primary driver of the variance of 3Q21 guidance, probably be in the range of $2-4m lower than the low EBITDA guidance.3Q21 EBITDA guidance was $21-31m, so it's excepted to be reported $17-29m..."
"SunPower CEO Peter Faricy said the acquisition was a natural fit for several reasons, including that Blue Raven’s customer-first approach aligns with SunPower’s motto. Additionally, more than 90% of Blue Raven’s customers are in 14 states that account for just 5% of SunPower’s sales. In other words, the acquisition expands SunPower’s footprint in places where the company has struggled to seize market share.“From a strategy point of view, this transaction is an example of something that allows us to serve consumers much faster than we would have otherwise,” Faricy said, adding that the deal will be revenue and EBITDA positive from day one.SunPower will gain more than 20,000 customers from Blue Raven, adding to the 376,000 residential customers it had at the end of the second quarter.The total transaction value of the acquisition is up to $165 million, with the cash required to close the deal standing at up to $145 million. SunPower used cash from operations to fund the acquisition, with the majority of the money raised after the company sold 1 million shares of Enphase Energy."
"Regardless of where this closes, still an awesome day on high volume. May give a little back but the trend is our friend."
"If we break 22,80 next stop is just under 30, knowing SPWR, when that happens, combined with all the news surrounding climate change and the two infrastructure bills I can see it rise up to 40 by 2022. Higher afterwards, possibly reach 70 if Democrats gain senate control in the mid-terms. A miraculous House win for democrats might send it to 80 even"
"Wellington has significant positions in both SPWR and MAXN.""Climate change “is a mega-trend that if you take advantage of it, and get ahead of it, it’s going to be an alpha generator for the next 30 or 40 years,” CalSTRS Chief Investment Officer Christopher Ailman said Wednesday at CNBC’s “Delivering Alpha.” “If you don’t pay attention to it, it’s going to be a negative alpha and you’re going to be stuck with a low-beta return.”Wendy Cromwell, vice chair at Wellington which had $1.4 trillion in assets under management as of the end of the second quarter, echoed these comments, saying of climate change that “investors need to study it, and companies need to be prepared for it.”""$MAXN"

SPWR still doing commercial and doing very well.
"$ENPH $SPWR From Barron’s :Of the various niches within solar, SunPower clearly sees the most opportunity in residential sales. The company gets its best margins from residential, and sees the potential for the market to grow from about 3 million homes to 100 million in the U.S. Plus, it seems clear investors want the company to focus more on that niche. We agree with the company’s tightening of its focus and look forward to additional strategic strokes to strengthen the company’s direction,” wrote Baird analyst Ben Kallo, who rates the stock at Outperform with a $34 price targetThe move offers investors another pure-play bet on rooftop solar, along with Sunrun and Sunnova Energy International (NOVA). But it makes it more clear that novice investors won’t have one dominant player to bet on."
It was this time last year the stock really started to take off..will we see a repeat?!?!
"Our good friend at BAC had this to say yesterday - Monthly U.S. solar panel imports hit their low point for the year in July, down 22% from a year ago and 18% sequentially. Year-to-date imports from South Korea are now down 31%, while Thailand imports are down 17%.Smith said the July slowdown is largely due to COVID-19 production shutdowns in Malaysia, Vietnam and other areas of Southeast Asia. Shipment holds and delays of utility scale projects are also contributing to the slowdown.“We find the import trend alarming – July YTD data in terms of MW is -5% y/y, whereas the overall US PV installations were expected to grow at +30% compared to 2020 levels (on a GW level),” Smith wrote in a note.So far this year, module imports are lagging their expected growth levels by about 67%."
"No end of day pullback, strong finish. This stock chart is really looking good. Tons of press and interest is growing."
Cash & cash equivalents at the end of Q2'2021 were $140 million. We can assume that SPWR sold 1 million ENPH shares to fund the $145M cash that were needed for the acquisition. That means that SPWR only has 1M ENPH shares and yet they are going to need $450M in 9 months. Good luck with that without an offering and dilution....
"Agree, under valued company, but very volatile/heavily traded. Future 10%+ bump days, if infrastructure ever gets done, when commercial side is sold, if ER is optimistic, any upgrades from ""analysts"". Future 10% drop days would be any random day for no apparent reason. Good luck everyone. I have a 6 kwh system on my house, live in cold northern climate and it makes total sense here, break even point ~10yrs. Combine that with an electric car, its like you have a quiet oil refinery on your roof. Solar growth is totally untapped."
"Not sure if that true statement as there is no any quote of Peter Faricy, saying about lower Q3 guidance.The company said in an update today (Tuesday) that its Q3 key guidance metrics are projected to be below the low end of the prior guidance ranges, primarily due to CIS project schedule delays and costs as well as the performance of its light commercial business.https://www.pv-tech.org/sunpower-mulls-sale-of-cis-unit-bolsters-residential-solar-position-with-blue-raven-deal/"
Hopefully some shorts get smashed by this. Remember it could dip at open but we had a pt of 27 put out before the new news....
"Enphase, Tesla ec. were long time underestimated by analysts. Their ratings should not be overestimated! The reorganisation will be completed by the end of 2021.

"I am guessing we are at max pain for the day, so I added 100 shares @$27.45 just for fun!I anticipated a minor pullback to mid-$27, possibly more pain tomorrow but patiently waiting for that break above the 200DMA."

Some good news finally. I am glad I added some shares about a month ago and put some trust in this company. Would have bought more if I could have.
"what happened, a 10% swing from up 6% to down 4%???"
"The difference in this uptrend, is not only profitable, partners with ENPH and a significant sale of commercial. This should take out $30 rather easily."

"Why SunPower Shares Are Rising3:48 pm ET October 12, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintShares of several solar stocks, including SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ: SPWR), are trading higher on continued strength amid energy supply shortages, causing a potential increase in demand for alternative energy sources.Shares of clean energy stocks have been volatile following the Senate passage of a US infrastructure bill, as clean energy and EV charging have been seen as beneficiaries of Biden's economic and infrastructure agenda.SunPower is a vertically integrated solar module manufacturer and systems installer. The company's modules derive from crystalline silicon technology and possess the industry's highest conversion efficiencies."
"Another great day, enjoy the ride."

"If they can't pull it down, it will go up!"

"Once again I feel the need to respond to idiotic quotes and so called ""articles"". As pointed out by the guy who had to make multiple accounts to manipulate new investors to sell, Motley fool pointed out, falsely, that ""management"" has said that the third quarter will be weaker and under the bottom of the projection.I've gone through EVERY interview and press release and found NOTHING of the sort. While I don't see ""management"" going out of their way to inform Motley Fools of anything. At the end of the day, they kept the acquisition of Blue Raven a secret for so so long.I, instead, found the exact opposite. This is a direct quote from a few days ago from CEO Peter Faircy regarding the supply shortage that was supposed to lead to lower results:""Faricy noted that SunPower has remained largely insulated from the chip shortage, saying that the company has visibility through the end of the calendar year. That said, he acknowledged the difficulty of securing components, saying supply chains are a “lifelong challenge.”Or in words this dumb dumb will understand: the chip shortage won't affect them untill 2022 but it is taken seriously and seen as a challenge. Just cover your short position, you'll be broker but it's not like your petty comments could avoid that in any sort of way"
Doesn’t Spwr officially join the s&p midcap 400 tomorrow? Could that provide a 2nd pop?
"The coming squeeze will be wonderful, terrible, and destructive to some! Keep on shorting, I love short term and excessive profits!"
"BAD NEWS: SPWR to miss Q3 estimates...""Management said this week that third-quarter 2021 results will be below the bottom end of guidance ranges because of delays and higher costs in commercial and industrial solar projects. This is nothing new for SunPower, which has seen its commercial and industrial segment generate low-single-digit gross margins for years. And it doesn't seem like the trend is getting any better.These projects are often very competitive, and the financial justification can be weaker than that of residential projects because commercial customers pay lower per kW-hr rates and more fixed costs through demand charges. To focus entirely on residential solar, management may just want to sell the business and move on. """
"I noticed a huge buying of shares on October 1st and 4th. Maybe 3-4X the normal volume was going on. I guess because of it got put on the S&P 400. That's good for us long-term holders. Anyway, I think SPWR is doing things long-term. I am glad I've added shares twice over the past 3 months."

"Finally! Some decent action here thanks to the Evercore upgrade:• SunPower (SPWR +5.5%) surges after Evercore ISI analyst Sean Morgan initiates coverage with an Outperform rating and a $27 price target, believing the company will close the valuation gap that trails competitors for now.• ""SunPower has a lower multiple than most of its peers, but it is levered to the same long-term secular tailwinds,"" Morgan writes.• The company has focused more on residential customers than on utility customers, which Morgan thinks should help increase margins over time, and it is building partnerships to make it easier for homeowners to add battery storage packs and charge their electric vehicles with power generated by solar panels.• SunPower also has transitioned more of its business to leasing solar panels to customers as opposed to selling them for cash, which provides a predictable cash flow stream that Morgan believes investors should value at a higher multiple.• Yesterday, SunPower announced it will exclusively provide solar technology to Toll Brothers homes and communities across California."

Love letter to @Doomboy Posted by @RobertN 15 days ago:SPWR broke above the 50 DMA at $22.67 and now needs to hold above this week on heavy volume and then will be hunting the 200 DMA and ready to test $28 range by end of OCT...$23 here we come!

"SPWR : Business leaders warn of supply chain collapse, solar tariffs delayed • 4:19 AM • Things appear to be getting worse, not better, along the global supply chain, which was upended by the coronavirus pandemic over a year ago. That means entire companies and industries are going to have to deal with more extremes for the foreseeable future, making business investment a shaky decision that compounds the original problem. The volatility and uncertainty also destroy demand as prices become too high for consumers. The phenomenon, called the ""bullwhip effect,"" could end up damaging the economy in the short-term, with violent swings in a range of goods. Seeking Alpha discussed the possibility back in May, but it looks like the situation is now in play.• Warning bells: In an open letter to the United Nations General Assembly, business leaders from the International Chamber of Shipping, IATA and other transport groups (that account for more than $20T of annual global trade) sounded the alarm on the risks of a supply chain meltdown. ""We are witnessing unprecedented disruptions and global delays and shortages on essential goods including electronics, food, fuel and medical supplies. Consumer demand is rising and the delays look set to worsen ahead of Christmas and continue into 2022. Our calls have been consistent and clear: freedom of movement for transport workers, for governments to use protocols that have been endorsed by international bodies for each sector and to prioritize transport workers for vaccinations... before global transport systems collapse.""• Some of the effects were on display this week as three more U.K. energy companies were pushed out of business by sky-high natural gas prices. China is also considering raising power prices for factories as an energy shortage there has unleashed turmoil in commodities markets and prompted silicon makers to dramatically slash production. Over in the U.S., the Commerce Department delayed a decision on solar tariffs with the price of panels set to rise, while Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) said it would sell more items above $1 to offset cost increases on a range of goods. • Do something! This time around, higher prices have put central banks between a rock and a hard place. Inflation is traditionally fought off by raising interest rates, but that might not be effective at the present given the supply chain issues taking place across the globe and the stage in the economic recovery. On the other hand, if easy monetary policy is left in place, price pressures could be compounded and result in a reduction in purchasing power or lead the economy to overheat.• Related: First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), V"
"We filled the HIGH of the gap open day (which was $23). However the 4pm CLOSE GAP is still open at $22.68. I usually don't pay attention to the 4pm gaps (I'm perfectly fine to just look at the day high gap close) but the fact is that SPWR has a history of closing those gaps as well. But there is no guarantee that it will. But at least be aware of that $22.68 gap open, especially because of how fast this market is collapsing... Good luck..."

"Not sure why everyone sweats the ""short"" term ups and downs. Things need to settle down: afgani, whatever the 3.5t budget will be, booster shot for covid, feds interest rate managment. SPWR markets and installs green. Anyone think there is no future in green... They are profitable - not like some other green. They will go up and down, but in the long term - 6 months from now, one year from now, 24 months from now, they will be alot higher. Tax incentives will continue or get bigger - battery break throughs are happening in amazing ways. These battery break improvements will drive SPWR BIG TIME! Don't worry - be happy. You own it:) And you will make money - this is one of the safer green bets around. It is not a question of making money, it is a question of how much you will make. Sit back, relax, it is going up."
where is the volume?...taking a breather after a nice pop!
"I am not a fan at all of people who short stocks. They're taking huge risks trying to keep this down when there will be a considerable demand for solar power. Hopefully, an infrastructure bill will be passed. If so, that would help us burn those shorting this who will be left holding the gab. Hoping to see this back at $57 next year."
It may test 30 in this week.
"Fund managers, pension planners are loading up for the 4th quarter, so they do not look like they missed the boat. I had buys in around 22.60 for tomorrow, those look like a no go."
"First big move for Faricy. On CNBC this morning - Shifting the company's focus to individual consumers is perhaps a natural fit for Faricy, who took the helm of SunPower in April. He was previously CEO of global direct-to-consumer for Discovery Inc., and also served as vice president of Amazon Marketplace.And while commercial and industrial solar offer alternative growth avenues, the majority of SunPower's revenue comes from residential operations.Full-year 2020 sales from residential and light commercial totaled $848 million, while the commercial and industrial unit brought in $254.8 million. The residential unit is also more profitable. Gross margins per watt jumped from $0.19 in 2019 to $0.66 this year, while margins from the commercial and industrial division declined from $0.25 to $0.06 during the same period.""The facts are the residential business is larger, it's faster growing and it's more profitable,"" Faricy summarized. ""[Residential] is the right place for us to focus on as we move forward, and I think we expect it to be well received by investors.""Looking forward, SunPower wants to be a one-stop shop for consumers. Rather than having a one-time customer relationship when the system is installed, the company is adding energy storage, electric vehicle capabilities and a host of digital products including energy management systems."
"Still way way undervalued, we're talking about a company with 1b+ revenue. Get back in before the bull  run!!"

"From a recent PV Magazine article:In Parts 1 and 2 of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels, and inverters. Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger."

"I have owned SunPower for a long time well before the split of SunPower and Maxeon. The things I still don't understand about Sun Power. If Maxeon makes SunPower panels and third parties install the panels .. then how does SunPower add value to the process such that they can make money? I know that they are starting to initiate value add services. But for now most of their business is installing panels.Also I know that commercial/industrial has lower margins. But if Maxeon panels are as good as they say (and getting better both from an efficiency and lower cost to install standpoint) then isn't fair to think that margins could get better. SunPower might see lower margins but they are the market leader with commericial/industrial. And again, they don't make panels and they don't install panels .. so how would staying with commercial/industrial slow up their increased focus on residential?Finally, since SunPower appears to be a ""solid"" and valuable brand name in the industry, what happens to the name when another company buys the industrial/commercial part of the business. It can't also be called SunPower. They will be loosing a valuable brand name with commercial/industrial. I hope Maxeon buys the commercial unit. It would ensure an outlet for Maxeon output. If SunPower margins on commercial are low, the Maxeon would be higher as they make money on panel manufacture. It makes the most sense. Or maybe Enphase. Just some question/thoughts. Any comments?"

"If whales wanted to take it up, they would have already after market yesterday, I don’t see much of up atm. Ill buy at 21 and hold for long term next time it goes down. SunPower is great company for long term"
"From an excellent new article on Seeking Alpha about SunPower: Read it quickly before it goes behind the firewall:ConclusionSunPower’s decision to let go of commercial and industrial solar and focus on the domestic rooftop solar PV market comes at a time of considerable anxiety about power supply. With the world embracing solar PV and wind power to exit fossil fuels, there have been hiccups in the transition and these won’t go away for a while. Having the capacity to self-produce power is attractive as is seen from the Australian experience where now one in four homeowners have installed solar PV on their rooftops and solar is making major contribution to domestic power generation. This also comes at a time when two further huge transitions are getting started. Firstly, home batteries extend the utility of self-produced power, while the looming electrification of transport means a further storage/access capacity (in their BEV battery) is coming for homeowners. There is an industry coming to help homeowners manage and optimise their power generation and use. Grid providers will almost certainly become part of this emerging transformation.The stars are aligning for SunPower. After a big runup at the end of 2020 and early 2021 when SunPower hived off Maxeon, SunPower has been in the doldrums until the recent announcements concerning the focus on residential solar. Over the past month the SPWR share price has risen 27% to trade above $28. There is huge anticipation about solar PV becoming the dominant means of electricity generation. This is perhaps best exemplified by Fatih Birol’s (Executive Director IEA) recent statement “I see solar becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets, …. Based on today’s policy settings, it’s on track to set new records for deployment every year after 2022.” Birol’s statement, taken together with the experience of householder solar PV making a major contribution to Australia’s power generation, why wouldn’t one get excited about SunPower’s new focus on waking up the US householder solar PV market?"

"Note how this correlates to SPWR's recently-announced program. ""COMMUNITY SOLAR: The Energy Department wants to make solar more accessible to everyday homes, with a new goal to expand community solar power to 5 million households by 2025. The initiative aims to create $1 billion in energy bill savings and reach out to households that are financially unable to afford solar power, including renters and homes without suitable roofs.The initiative would offer free technical assistance to members of the National Community Solar Partnership, which includes solar developers and local governments and has already distributed $1 million for technical assistance. ""Community solar is one of the most powerful tools we have to provide affordable solar energy to all American households, regardless of whether they own a home or have a roof suitable for solar panels,"" Granholm said in a statement.Democrats in the administration and on the Hill have been pushing solar access as both a climate and environmental justice issue, with expanding low-income access to solar power as a way to free vulnerable communities from high-polluting generation. Ossoff is pushing two bills to bolster domestic solar manufacturing and rooftop solar deployment, with the support of Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden for inclusion in reconciliation. Granholm lauded the legislation during her Georgia trip with Ossoff, calling it ""essential"" for reconciliation."""

"it's typical Friday, Shorts will be forced to cover on Monday."
Back above $24 - shorties better cover. C&I sale or spinoff could be announced any day.
I can't believe the Toll Brothers announcement did not generate more volume and gains. Toll Brothers website states it currently is delivering new homes in 24 states and the annoucement said that the agreement discussed expansion into other states. Most of the homes that Toll is building in California are priced way over $1 million so I imagine the top of the line system will be used with storage.
"200DMA Resistance today after a very nice run up $28 was the target by end of OCT. needs to break above and hold on consistent above avg. volume, but probably not without a minor pullback to mid-$27 range before goes to $30range...let's see what the end of the week brings?"

Huge green day tomorrow!!
"There's practically guaranteed growth ahead in this industry, and SPWR is under 9 P/E? Buying more."
$25…100% Guaranteed this SPWR Is a beast so now take me to jail …DOOM and Gloom is crying to his mommy!
"JUST IN: Poly spot prices skyrocket. Panel manufacturers are squeezed from every direction, especially Maxeon that depends on poly, wafers and cells from 3rd parties. As solar is very price sensitive in the whole chain from consumer to manufacturer, I expect warnings galore once Q3 earnings and Q4 guidance comes out. Stay tuned..."
Great start to the week. Will we get news on a C&I deal?
"SunPower will replace Cimarex Energy Co. in the S&P MidCap 400 index before trading begins on Oct. 5, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices."
"Bound to be some profit taking after 2 strong up days. Overall, can't complain at $27 with a BRIGHT future!"
"Excellent volume today after a nice piece of PR ""Toll House Bros"", long base has formed during a healthy consolidation over last few months...Bollinger Band Squeeze ready to pop and take out 50DMA @~$23.60...hopefully will then run up to test 200DMA in the $28 range by end of Oct."
I would like someone to explain why they think this stock is worth over 30 ps.

"very good news today re. Ca. residential deal. Putting all the pieces together, Solar panels, Storage and charging station."
For a guy who impersonated others and made multiplie accounts just to manipulate others you do have loads to say about the legality of things...
"SPWR/ENPH/MAXN ""Solar Trinity""...all have taken a beating an. On Sale now!... ready to GO!"
"I am sure DOoom boy is calling for me to be a jailed loser SPWR junk garbage Pumper #1!lol$28 was expected and will be temporary resistance as profit takers swap with new buy in as the whole solar sector takes off with looming energy crisis.SPWR TA: 50 DMA @low $20s was a strong support as consolidation took place post significant pullback ~%50 over a few months...Bollinger band squeeze broke free starting new upward trend on good news and great VOLUME...now hunting the 200DMA @$28.50 range finding temporary resistance at $28 today. Already Hit the target of $28 by end of OCT. strength into end of year with potential Santa Claus Rally, could send this in to $30s and beyond. Patience pays time and again, invest stay Long add on dips.SPWR #1 Pumper"
"Don`t expect extremely good Q3 numbers. Restructuring takes time! But a good outlook and more details the ""residential market strategy"" about could push the ""SP"". Nevertheless, 2022 should be our focus. Subsidies, less chip shortage - we will see a solar boom!"
Tremendous volume today particularly near the close and I guess related to the S&P 400 inclusion news..let's hope this indicates some big bounce for tomorrow!
Rocket ships SPWR and MAXN had all systems check green today...ready for launch next week!!
"SHORT INTEREST SEP 30, 2021 = 15 million shares short or DOWN -70% FROM A YEAR AGOSHORT INTEREST OCT 15, 2020 = 42 million shares short or 52% of float shorted"
Upgrades will soon follow for this and MAXN..all sytems check ready for launch!!
Being added to mid cap index.
"Bought the pullback, now holding tight. Hard to not take profit, but this will keep on going up soon, do not want to be left out."
"Where was this published this week? First I heard of it was in the MF article - ""Management said this week that third-quarter 2021 results will be below the bottom end of guidance ranges because of delays and higher costs in commercial and industrial solar projects."""
On 1/11 SPWR opened at 28 and by 1/29 it hit 57. I don’t think that is going to happen here but it’s been a nice breakout.
"This Solar news was on the INTC board.

I see a lot of downward pressure tomorrow from options expiration. The MMs will want to drop it below $25. I'm hopeful that it'll tough out the storm though.
Wow - nice AH gain! Should be an interesting day tomorrow with the addition to the S&P MidCap 400 index
For all those that don’t use TA…50DMA CONSOLIDATION BOLLINGER BAND SQUEEZE and now the POP…no on saw this coming right? All doom and gloom.lol SPWR will hunt the 200DMA now around $28 range by end of OCT.
"Just goes to show, woke news is no news!"
"10yr yields ripping higher, something to keep an eye on."
"This global energy crisis, might #$%$ the markets short term, but long term it can only be good for SPWR. The solution is localized renewables in conjunction with energy storage. I expect the stock to trend back to the 30's pretty soon."
Upgrades coming I bet!
Dina what price you buy at?
10 p/e + 18% short float + upcoming infrastructure spending = $50 per share for SPWR
"Low volume, seems waiting on news."
"Wondering at what price they sold the 1 mln ENPH shares? Still 2,5 mln. remaining. Exactly the amount to pay of the debt."
"REASON FOR TODAY'S SOLAR EUPHORIA: Speculators expect more solar M&A (mergers and acquisitions) ahead, and bumping up valuations...."
Sunpower still undervalued. It should reach 60 $ ++. This is the real price  before market dropped It deserves 60 $+++
"The ONLY thing that could make SPWR go higher is much higher EPS and much higher margins. Current earning estimates are coming DOWN, they are not going up... 90d ago EPS for 2021 and 2022 were 38c and 65c.... now they are 30c and 54c or DOWN -20%.... 12 month analyst targets are still average $25... and the targets won't go up till profits go up, not down...."
I've been long here since it was around $5 but have not bought new shares in ages. Have decided to buy more today with the company fully committing to home solar as a strategy. I think the market will like that as the commercial space has lower margin and lots of project delays etc. Also I think there are more chances to sell additional services for recurring revenues like VPP software etc. Following in RUN's footsteps here.
evercore $27 PT
"I hate buying when it’s green. But this stock is so undervalued. So I might as well scoop up some more before it gets back to where it should be at, around the 28-35 area. I still believe it will be over $80 in the long run. But as for now it should be sitting in the high 20’s or low 30’s."
"To me the last few days have been a very good sign. We moved up 6% independently from the NASDAQ which means it's not just people buying and selling Nas shares, it's people very intentionally buying SPWR. AND we held strong yesterday to keep the dock rope on 23!"
looks like a third day with more than 5% gains.
With the continued strength in volume SPWR could easily see $25 before end of the week and will hunt that 200 DMA at $28…by end of month should see new news execution details which will push it back into $30’s
Now I can breath.... finally I am above the water. Feel so fresh. Continue to hold to enjoy the fresh air.
"Doomboy wants to cast doubt and use nothing but trash talk to do so...100% Guarantees are always and never guaranteed...with that said TA is a very valuable resource when looking to get in and out or add, Fundamentals are the foundation for even considering the investment. Nothing criminal about TA not working out in the form of a BULL run, last time I checked Paid Analyst often post information to manipulate SP in the favor of the people that pay them, haven't seen anyone go to jail yet!...So shut up already DOOMdumaZZZZ!"
"The fact that SPWR announced intent to sell the commercial side, sure makes it look like there is already interest. I expect that announcement in October."
Remeber that the time to buy is when everyone is selling..same goes for MAXN.
A more significant flow of buying volume would be nice...SPWR typically fades the end of day without. Regardless GREEN is GREEN!
"WOW!! Get rid of commercial and industrial and only focus on residential after buying a small solar company that does residential??? HUH???? The consumer is,tapped out and housing prices may drop......HUH??"
"I’m back was here a long time ago at 6-7 range when everyone on this board said sell this company going bankrupt, I think 20s is a great buy point"
HF .....?!! would you let this go up to it's real price..It should be 60$ ..Rules must be up dated to stop this 
"Just read this on Marketwatch and could see this same strategy helping SPWR retailers...Hedges need to get checked and obviously SPWR is a highly manipulated. ""Since being knocked out of January’s short squeeze by online brokers trying to avoid margin calls, retail investors have been seeking alternatives to their multi-front war on short selling hedge funds, and after months of research they appear to have found it.Cutting the brokers out altogether.In recent days, an increasing number of retail investors have swapped their torches, pitchforks and TD Ameritrade accounts for direct registration platforms like Computershare CPU, +1.24%, which have seen an influx of business from the meme crowd."""
Still undervalued...real price 60 $
"As iPhone13 suggested below that MAXN buy the C&I business, why the negative sentiment? If MAXN builds the US plant, and if MAXN sells the industrial project products under their own name, wouldn't it be compelling to MAXN, Total, or other major investors to take over this line of business? Just wondering...$MAXN"
"Sure has been more volume lately. Hopefully more stable shareholders, funds etc."
YTD 10% again time to sell? Or believe another squeeze will happen?
"MORE BAD NEWS: SPWR with a huge miss on Q3 earnings, PE has skyrocketed from 68 to over 80.... SPWR is now 6x more OVERVALUED than Apple...."
SPWR broke above the 50 DMA at $22.67 and now needs to hold above this week on heavy volume and then will be hunting the 200 DMA and ready to test $28 range by end of OCT...$23 here we come!
"@iPhone13 We had launch in January when SPWR and MAXN hit $58. Sorry you missed it, and thanks for your money... ROTFL"
"Looks like we are breaking out to upside, good vol, sector strong.The fundamentals still concern me, but that didn’t stop RUN from a monstrous move when it acquired Vivint, taking advantage of synergies which still to this day I doubt reached 90mil."
"With >14M shares short, it takes at least week to cover 1/3 of the short, assuming 1/5 of day-trading from the short covering. Cheers."
"Overall market volatility creates noise...SPWR currently testing 50 DMA @~$22.60 support, hopefully holding above with continued buying volume through the rest of the week as Sept. ends and Oct. begins. Bollinger Squeeze building up more pressure to pop the top!"
"Sunpower became part of S&P midcap 400 as of Oct 4, 2021. That alone is a significantly positive event for Sunpower stock price. And, Sunpower's P/E =10.3 is a calming factor if trend reverse. That is not all. Democrat's clean energy policy is a big plus for the stock. Energy price is up and up these days. And, people turn their eyes to alternatives. Eventually, all US residence having solar panel on their roof top or back yard is ideal as lasting energy solution. Question is how far Sunpower stock will go up. In high energy price environment, energy can be a huge bargaining tool. When I checked the Q2 top 10 institutional ownership on SPWR, I found they increased the stake in SPWR. Personally, question I have is whether SPWR pass $ 60 ."
