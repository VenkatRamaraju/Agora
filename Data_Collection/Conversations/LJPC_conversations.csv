tangs never look at the rear view mirror its in the past
"More Giapreza/Xerava licensing agreements will be announced (Asia, Australia, MENA, SoAm)US FDA Approval for Giapreza around the cornerStreet will up PT (strong buy!)Institutional investors will flockQ1/2021 - $10 (min)"
"Number of shares purchased by TCP: 10,048,224Amount paid for shares purchased by TCP: $66,153,260Average price per share: $6.59Still holding!!!"
no movement. Stagnant in the water. that's a shame
slowly selling small lots for micro profits. Not worth the wait.So sorry Tang and eddie
"Traded 70% of float thus far. Let's hope shorts will cover completely this time around, which means with continued positive news and we can move towards to 30's. I am holding until then, I am not smart enough to trade."
"June 27, 2018. The day bottom slides out of LJPC. Game Over."
Great earnings
"Speculations:1. First 401 Interim results are much, much better than originally thought2. 501 numbers are getting better3. 501 Europe approval is coming this month, maybe indicated done deal?4. Maybe Tidmarsh and Tang are entertaining the sale of the company, hopely over 1 billion"
It's coming!
"Bet LJPC-0118 progress is just around the corner, hence why Tang keeps buying up all the shares. Remember this (below) from 2yrs ago? Wonder how they're doing now? Can you imaging what would happen to LJPC share price if FDA grants EUA? POW!!!!!In the meantime, KT/LE much more patient than us, guess we'll just have to wait and see!!!https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/24/1808817/0/en/La-Jolla-Pharmaceutical-Company-Announces-U-S-FDA-s-Grant-of-Breakthrough-Therapy-Designation-for-LJPC-0118-for-the-Treatment-of-Severe-Malaria.html"
Tang at it again?! Sure we'll see another Form4 for LJPC later this week with TCP buying up more shares.
The market has been going south for a solid month. it's the worst reduction since the Great depression. The only question now is when to start buying more.
Day trading? Price has barely budged for them to salivate
"An earnings surprise of 184.62% this quarter!!!!!!! Shouldn't we be up? Like way up? And only 52,187 shares traded today (as of 10am Pacific). WTH?! ------------La Jolla Pharmaceutical (LJPC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.13 per share. This compares to loss of $0.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 184.62%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consnsus EPS estimates three times."
Only algo's trading between themselves few shares. No one is selling.
Dec. 11 at 6:48 PM ilvbiotkkkk$LJPC WOOF WOOF shorts TRAPPED AGAINahahahahahahah
"Edward's job to grow revenue and not Tang. Tang probably has lot more issues with his other holdings. If both drugs sells, even not that well, the revenue will go up 2X, 3X even if US stays or growths slightly."
Confidential Treatment?https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920465/999999999718003881/9999999997-18-003881-index.htm
if i was short - i get out now. big hedge fund or jpmorgan short - i take this up to 45 and get out now. or else they may not be able to get out until 60 to 90? 90 would be 3 billion price tag fully diluted 33 mil shares
We have a news from China Partner Everest Medicines Initiates.I’m sure we don’t get any news from LJPC
"Hedge funds want to get all retail investors shares, this always happens with almost all biotech before the sp goes up . Tang know he would need to buy at 9 to 15 sp level to push the sp to mid 20 before accepting a buyout offer I personally don’t think anything less than 1.4 billion or 55 a share would be acceptable by ljpc board , the company will not last long … it has no reason if ljpc can sell 50 millions in us market with 120 employees , big pharmaceutical would sell easily 150 million with 88000 and that no counting Europe of the far east. Patient is the key here ."
"Traded this for small gains early this year. Happy for all the longs here! I'm glad someone is making money. I'm in oversold divi play SMLP and I'd be excited to get half the gains you guys have gotten today. Anyway, Congrats longs and make a ton!"
"La Jolla is expecting to hear from European regulators about a go/no-go decision on Giapreza in the second half of the year. If the regulatory decision is positive, the drug's addressable market opportunity could grow by more than half, so this remains a major catalyst for investors to look forward to.If you're bullish on Giapreza's potential and think that European regulators will give it the thumbs-up, then right now might not be a bad time to consider picking up a few shares."
"Hold off selling till mid February. All the insiders sold large number of Jan and Feb calls at mid 30s.Once Feb options expire, you will see JP Morgan upgrade this to ""Strong Buy"" and slap on a 70 price target.Just another day in the market to pick pockets of retail investors."
"PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION - In the S-3 filing they disclose it might be shares, warrants or debt, and that they may sell them directly or through brokers or underwriters. That is all boilerplate, but what jumps out is that they did not announce an underwriter. So as of this moment it seems there is no immediate sale of the shares. They were just registered to be sold. I dont know what their intentions are or if they might start selling share At The Market (ATM) meaning just selling shares. The cap on the dollar value is $150 million so there is no fixed price and no set debt obligation or interest rate etc. Maybe we will get an announcement later. Maybe they won't sell any of the shares (though that seems unlikely)."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here , they keep the sp down and then from 4 to 20 in few days , this is a solid investment at this sp , I have added few thousand shares today’s from the profits of other biotech, ljpc turn will come soon and it’s going to be epic proportionate I truly think this will reach 45 in few months, but do you own research before going heavily here Iam at 28k share and will add some more tomorrow , very soon they will not be able to hold the sp down any longer, paion should start selling both drugs by July estimated sales peaks is 80 - 120 million annually and that’s Europe alone."
Form 4 Tang bought almost 400k shares last two days.
forward expansion that's all tangly delicious u see yourself in mirror u shall see doubter. lemon grass chilled with bomby mmmm. slice of lime mmm
"We need EMA approval on 501 (plan and status of potential pharma partner), need some clear numbers on 118 revenue, clear 501 US marketing plan for increase promotion and sales (with new guy), and 401 projected sales (implementation phase and full phase). However, T's have 0 project planning (forward action) skills, we may be lost in a phone booth with Bobby, Robbie, and T's."
Baker Bro's upped their position significantly
"People laughed when i said to sell at 10 and buy back at 6. The reality is here. Over the next 4 weeks, we will see the stock price push up to 9 (beware of Feb 15 options).If you are short on the retail side, be warned. All the institutional shorts have covered. Perceptive is gone. Tang had his revenge. Again, retail short, BEWARE the Ides of Feb."
"9.8 million (3 month LJPC and 2 months Tetra) == full Q Tetra probably @ 11 million.If revenue growth develops as Tang is hoping for 2X the current, we could hit 100 million and positive earnings ... could go for the price he is looking for!"
$LJPC is running for the top on coronavirus treatment news. Here's what you need to know: https://alphastocknews.com/la-jolla-pharmaceutical-co-ljpc-stock-rockets-on-covid-19-news/2820/

"Yeah, looks like Tang bought almost 3 mil additional shares at around 6 bucks. Wow. That's a confidence."
SNaidu can you be honest and tell us how much you are underwater in LJPC? You go around asking people about their personal stuff so I thought may be you are all about sharing your personal details. We might be a more accommodating and empathetic if we know what you are going through. So tell us how much you lost in LJPC and your total stake. Do you have other stocks and assets? List them and their value and if you have a mortgage or loan from your parents.... list them here. It's a beneign ask so dont think it would be a problem for you cupcake.

HC Wainwright put out a $91 price target last week. Estimates are that they make money in 2019. So do the traders know something we don't or are they trying to shake out the little guy?

"Tang bought last 3 trading days 278,369 more shares."

Market cap 120 millions. Cash 82 millions. Good pipelines. I can't be more bullish.

"This will close on green today , ljpc became a small cap and very easy to manipulate , it’s just a game they play have nothing to do with the performances the company which never had any leak of info before , an announcement of partnership with good sales it will go from 6 to 20 in a day"

"La Jolla to provide GIAPREZA for emergency medical program for septic shockLa Jolla Pharmaceutical Company announced that it is providing GIAPREZA for an emergency medical program in patients with septic shock due to COVID-19 at the Centre Hospitalier Interregional Edith Cavell Delta Hospital in Brussels, Belgium. GIAPREZA is being made available for emergency medical use based on a request from Professor Daniel De Backer, M.D., Head, Department of Intensive Care, CHIREC Delta Hospital in Brussels, Belgium. According to Belgian law, authorized medicines can be made available prior to commercial availability in order to fulfill special patient needs. GIAPREZA has been recently approved by the European Commission but is not yet commercially available in Europe."
"Looks like the beginning of a short squeeze. It took 1.4 million shares to bring price down $4 in one day. We now know Joe bought 175,000 of those so shorts did not cover in nearly half of the available liquidity that day. Now it is up $2 on a mere 70,000 shares so far. Shorts have a real hard time from here on out."
tang know
They announced today annual share holders meeting July 21st They didn’t have any last year.It’s a good news better than nothing.
tang say buy people .
Sales Increasing ...... No Debt ....... and cash in the bank. Need to continue to increase sales and reduce expenses. so far so good. Long LJPC
"I don't believe LJPC is a $300M company today but it will be. In the only article I could find on Giapreza in actual use, it is credited with saving the life of a retired coach in Michigan. With only about 300 hospitals stocking it according to the article I read. As more hospitals add it to their inventory, the results will multiply. This also adds to the likelihood of EU approval next month."
"Simon - yes it is worrisome, albeit it did get that prelim acceptance one year ago. Tyrant CEO has not mentioned EMA or vocal about it in the recent press releases. It was only in the footnotes."
"Giazpreza is going to be the new standard of care for septic shock:In the final rule concerning Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2019, CMS states that: “Based on the data provided by the applicant and consideration of the public comments we received, we agree with the applicant and the commenters that GIAPREZA represents a substantial clinical improvement over existing technologies because it quickly and effectively raises MAP while allowing for a reduction in other vasopressors.”"

6.7 million shares short 1/15/2019! Down again. Good news for longs. Shorts diminished.
"From last filing, Tang at 9.8M Shares. Earnings coming soon."
Absolute Buy Here.This Company Has Zero Debt.LJPC could stop all Research & Devolopement today and make $28 million per year and never look back. Thats just with Giapreza!
"Last story to Robbie - ""true story"". About 4 years ago, I called LJPC guy (CFO) to ask a question, somehow I got Tidmarsh. This is still early stages since LJPC took over a previous shell company so they actually answer and/or returns calls. I asked Tidmarsh a simple question about something (I can not remember). His response was very shocking and unexpected to me. He said if you don't like what we are doing, you can just sell. I did not sell at that time because of their inaccurate 501 sales projection, the stock seemed to be in progression as you put it Robbie. That is why it did not surprise me, when I read the earnings call transcripts, that the way Tidmarsh handles or interact with the analysts."
"Last chance today to buy the $28 call option for tomorrow's closing. This thing will fly over the weekend. Buying a in the money call optin today will give you a free ride over the weekend.When the stock open at $34 on Monday, you get a free ride. :-)"
"Technically - no more shocking stuff from Tidface and continued good fortune, next stop is $10, then $16, and then $22 -- higher."

I told ya $5 is our floor now. Grab anything that goes below. The stock just got de-risked with the news.
"Drug is effective but Shorts have choked off the float. It takes about 12 months for hospital formularies and EMRs to adapt. Nothing mgmt can do about it. Assuming drug continues to perform well clinically (no half-life issues, adverse events), revenue should tick up. If revenue exceeds $40M per quarter, company can break-even, valuation is secure and shorts will exit slowly. Mgmt has no incentive to go for a quick buyout. Better for them to wait for revenue growth to accelerate beyond $40M and control their own destiny after that. The risk of failure is entirely on shareholders, not on mgmt. And that's why the stock is so low -- chances of failure are still high. But it will be proved out one way or the other in the next few quarters."
"Rumor is, Tang hiding NDA Application for Malaria in the bad news, to sell priority review voucher to Big Pharma+the rest of the assets (Cash, approved Medicine, ...).

"The story here isn't that complicated. A lot more information to be released this week.Anupam Rama graduates from Boston University and moves to OH looking for analyst work.

Perspective Capital makes money as the stock travels both ways. Along the way, these guys run into Tang, an analyst who is moving onto bigger things. The Edelman-Rama duo gets miffed with Tang.Fast Forward 15 years.Perspective buys big into Tang's company. Edelman finds out when the FDA approval is due. At the right moment, Edelman creates huge short position against is own holdings. Rama berates the stock at the right moment. Edelman forces the board to dilute. Edelman covers. FDA approval comes out, the stock barely recovers. Having restricted the company's cash flow, Edelman pushes for another dilution. Tang digs his heels and makes a loan deal. Edelman wants another shot at the short/dilution cycle. Rama is exposed and JPMorgan has him on warning.Edelman is now short against the box, essentially neutral on his stock position. Perspective is on the board, but being neutral, they have no upside. In a desperate attempt, Perspective tries to make another run at shorting. JPMorgan gets inquiry by authorities who are looking into Rama's activities and offshore investments.JPMorgan forces Perspective's hand by reducing the number of days to cover. Short positions start to shrink. From Edelman's perspective, the light at the end of the tunnel may be a freight train.

Guys.. I am buying.. npow.. See it go up and thank me..
"$PRTK is valued at $200mil based on anticipated 2020 annual sales of $83mil. When buying a house or stock, one likes to look at comparatives before valuing that specific asset they want to purchase. Well here's a very simple and unmistakable comparison for you... a recent transaction WITHIN the antibiotics space was the acquisition of $TTPH by $LJPC. $LJPC will pay in total $59mil of compensation for $TTPH ($43mil upfront and $16mil in future). $TTPH only has one drug (XERAVA, an injection only, one indication drug) with anticipated 2020 annual sales of $7-10mil. Using simple math, PRTK should currently be valued at least 10x the value of this acquisition based on sales figures, thus valuing the company at $590mil. Thats by me using irrefutable mathematics comparing one asset to another. Throw in some soft characteristics comparisons like PRTK has 2 approved FDA drugs, one of which is owned by them, the other licensed off. The one owned and marketed by PRTK, omadacyline (Seysera) is approved for 2 indications, soon to be once daily oral or intravenous for both indcations. Not to mention the contract with the US government and the potential for many more purchases throughout the years moving forward. It is abundantly clear to me, this asset is significantly undervalued. Time for the investor base to wake up and smell the roses."

"Zacks: Brokerages Expect La Jolla Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:LJPC) Will Announce Quarterly Sales of $6.90 Million, Posted by Shanna Eddington on Aug 16th, 2019Equities research analysts expect La Jolla Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:LJPC) to announce $6.90 million in sales for the current fiscal quarter, Zacks reports.

I see a steady climb in the weeks and months ahead.
such easy money.This is a cycle over and over again with LJPC. Sorry buy its true.Look at the history and prove me wrong. I believe in the possibility of a buyout but not for many billions.maybe 2 or 3 at most which would be fine for my long position but it's too easy to go short almost weekly on this one wants she starts trending down. They just aren't selling the Gia and the abx has too much competition for large revenue for many many years..Show me differently
"Unless ljpc report less sales for 2q I don’t see any a reason why the company-shouldn’t be sold for 20 a share ... less than 500 mil . Tang now is the ceo and basically he is only assisting in the sales of Gia and maybe dealing with sales rep directly , he own 33% of the company so no one have more interest to sell the company than him ,Europe gia approval should be worth at least 150 mil , I don’t know what happen to successful ljpc 401 phase 2 but should be included in the sale , plus the newly bought antibiotic drug , I hope to see something happen in weeks or few months only ."
Merger or buyout?

"Hedge funds own 44% of the shares and they control the direction, the same hedge funds also have a short position, they need to take this red to cover that.

I think the consolidation will last a couple more days, average down as much as you can."

"I am extremely bullish on LJPC -401. Haemochromatosis is iron overlad, and is toxic to the body. Left untreated, Haemochromatosis will lead to life-threatening diseases. Heart disease, Liver cancer, cirrhosis, Endocrine disorders, including diabetes, different cancers and infections. Haemochromatosis is the most common hereditary disorder in the world. 1 in 9 is a carrier, and more than 16 million Americans suffer from iron overload. LJPC -401 had tremendous results in phase one and is expected to have great reaults under the current patient study. Most investors are unaware of the seriousness of Haemochromatosis and the size of the population that is at risk. In conclusion, LJPC has two drugs that will create huge revenues that will justify much higher prices on the stock."
"> LJPC-0118 (I.V. artesunate) is La Jolla’s investigational product for the treatment of severe malaria. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in LJPC-0118, artesunate, was demonstrated to be superior to quinine in reducing mortality in patients with severe falciparum malaria infection in two randomized, active-controlled, clinical studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Orphan Drug designation for LJPC-0118 for the treatment of malaria in April 2019 and July 2019, respectively.< So how about this as a potential coronavirus drug if it's better than other anti-malarials out there? Hope they're looking into it"

Anyone try calling Tang about changing LJPC status and way to sell 501?

"Around 10 is first threshold level, then it is 16, then 22, then around 32 to 34. We need 501 approval in Europe with a good distribution partner (Big Pharma hopely). Then some good positive sales numbers in US rest of the year. Then we should hit over 30 or possibly 40 by the year end. Holding."

"Thursday (6/14): European Hematology Association Congress, Stockholm (4 days). La Jolla Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:LJPC): Phase 1 data on LJPC-401."
Cowen analysts said LJPC has 400 - 500% upward potential with 2 approved drugs.
"A broker told me that LJPC is on their NTB “no shares available to borrow” list, and that is a rare thing. . I checked at another broker, they say there are 150,000 shares available to borrow. It is still a small number next to the total of 8.4 million shares short.Why don’t the large owners put a hurting’ on the shorts? Maybe they will after the Q2 earnings. Tang and Edelman are both 10% holders so they may have to wait until after a quiet period to buy more, if they are even going to buy more. Either way this is a potential powderkeg. If the Q2 revenues show strong Giapreza sell-in there is no telling what may happen. It would be even better if they had some guidance showing good sell through in July. LJPC is trading at a market cap of apx $800 million, which is low for a company with a new drug that will save 100,000+ lives a year. Gia is a potential blockbuster but trades for less than a developmental stage biotech. How many people even know about this company? LJPC only has 26 million shares outstanding, but the top 30 funds and institutions hold 27 million shares. Tang Capital holds an additional 4.1 million shares. George Tidmarsh owns more than 1 million. I also found a fund by the name Consonance Capital that reported to the SEC a 2 million share position, which would make them the 5th largest holder of LJPC – but for some reason the reporting bureaus didn’t list them as a top holder. Skimming the filings I saw that there are a number of medium sized hedge funds based out of New York that have significant holdings in LJPC. I wonder if they are “related” entities or share ideas with each other. Anyway add all that up and it comes to 34.1 million shares held by the largest investors. Since there are only 26 million shares outstanding, subtract 26 million from the 34.1 million in the hands of the top holders and we get a sum of 8.1 million. That is pretty darn close to the total number of shares shorted. It leaves 300,000 left over. But shouldn’t there be many other investors, funds and groups that do not report their holdings? Wouldn’t you expect there to be more than 300,000 shares held by non-reporting investors? So this stock continues to confound me. But if the stock cannot be shorted anymore, then some of the shorts might fail to deliver which in theory would force them to buy back in. Buying in obviously gives the price life. If we get great Q2 numbers that spark a rally in the share price coupled with the inability of the shorts to short any more, and possibly a requirement to buy-in their shorts… wel the stock has potential to move by big leaps and bounds. Even if the Q2 numbers come in poor, which I doubt, all these shorts will give some buoyancy to the stock as the shorts use any pullback to cover."

Is this a right time to sell LJPC stocks? What does the future of the company look like?
"Bob Sharma (Seeking Alpha) interprets latest trial results:""One of the key news was the survival benefit shown by La Jolla Pharmaceuticals' (LJPC) angiotensin II formulation Giapreza in a posthoc analysis in patients with distributive shock (which is commonly septic shock) and acute kidney injury, AKI who required renal replacement therapy. Despite showing successful phase 3 results in the ATHOS 3 trial in distributive shock, bears have always been skeptical about the commercial potential of Giapreza (although it helped achieve the target blood pressure at 3 hours in significantly higher number of patients vs. placebo), the reason being that the ATHOS 3 trial failed to show a difference in mortality between the drug arm and the placebo. The NEJM paper publishing the ATHOS 3 data clearly mentioned that the trial was not powered to show a mortality benefit. The stock has doubled in last year, still, bears have always been skeptical. Hopefully, the data from today will silence the bears. AKI is very commonly seen in septic shock (53% incidence as per this paper). About 89% of these patients with AKI and septic shock may require renal replacement therapy (like dialysis or hemofiltration). The data released today showed higher survival in these patients at day 28 of follow-up (53% vs. 30%, p=0.012). Additional benefit seen in AKI subgroup could be due to the homeostatic effect of angiotensin II in maintaining glomerular filtration rate. The data could increase the commercial adoption of Giapreza."""

"Too brilliant to be missed! Amazing DD @nickpd @R8Plus LJPC ended its fiscal year of 2019 with a bang, seeing its Giapreza revenue jumps 74% year over year compared to 2018. Much of these rev were the delayed reaction to its sale campaign since Critical Care Congress in 2019 where it was one of major sponsors. Hosts of new discovery about the use of Gia have steadily popped up in clinical literature and talks among practicing clinicians...Like any new drug, the launching process is typically an exercise of patience and perseverance, especially for a small bio co to go-at-it alone. With multiple tail winds 2020 such as Priority Voucher award ($90-$100M+ of nondilute financing), the pending FDA approval of artesunate, EU launch of Gia, Surviving Sepsis Campaign high probability of guideline’s inclusion for Gia, and more cardiac usage in CABG, vasoplegia, etc, we expect share price to appreciate considerably as more events unfold in days ahead. We are long in LJPC.https://writer.zohopublic.com/writer/published/bnmzk9998173e21714a869d9db6d4ca47a5cc"
"Okkkkk ... so the brought it down for new ceo to have a buy options of 400k share for 3.89 and lowered a little more next day to cover that they did that ! , after all .50 cent for 400k share is 200k dollar , but now what are they going to get their act together and think that they have a shareholder or they are going to continue to act as if this is privately owned company, the company should be at 600 million market cap and it’s at 90 million and it seems like no one cares , worst case scenario Gia will sell 35 million in USA , the new antibiotic drug should sell over 20 million for 2021 according to their sec filing, now Europe should come to the arena with at least 35 million annually, the company have only sales rep the monthly cost should be 1 million or so only , and again this company is not a success story but I think if they prove that they can maintain over 100 million in sales annually, I don’t see any reason why big pharmaceutical companies won’t buy it for a round 1 b , which is around 45 a share"
I increased my position at 5 29 today. we will see $7 by the end of next week.
"Don’t like how is management handling things and very reserved in giving information that help share price such as what’s going on in Europe, l know if Tidmarsh offered $50 a share he will decline that offer , Iam doubling down again and I know this ljpc will reach $70 a share in a year or so"
There are two news posted under publication. Tang is destroying this company.
Institutional ownership is very impressive. A lot of recent accumulation and the statistics I’ve seen point to at least %90 holdings by big names.

"You Betcha - Understood! You bought all your shares below $10 and you are happy. Before being critical of others, please put yourself in their shoes. Sincerely, what you may think Simon and I are not the same person. I am sure Simon is a good guy on his own but I so not want to be him as well as he would not want to be me. I believe we just have common feeling that Tidmarsh has done a horrific job and did nothing to help or enhance the marketing of 501 when it was apparent. He has done a terrible job of planning of 501 commercialization (he must never taken a business course of project / product planning)."

"This is huge news. Price is no longer an issue, sales should increase greatly:The CMS NTAP program provides additional reimbursement to hospitals beyond the Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group (MS-DRG) reimbursement for specific products that meet strict criteria for the treatment of Medicare patients. The amount of the NTAP is equal to 50% of the amount by which the covered costs exceed the MS-DRG reimbursement, or 50% of the cost of the drug, whichever is less. The NTAP for GIAPREZA is effective for the CMS 2019 fiscal year, which begins on October 1, 2018, and is expected to continue for a period of up to two or three years, after which the MS-DRG payments will be adjusted based on hospital-reported costs and utilization. The NTAP program is only available to new drugs that represent an advance in medical technology that substantially improves, relative to technologies previously available, the treatment of Medicare patients."

"Just had my 3rd bagger stock since Aug.

I did all this with some portion of the funds coming from selling 100% of $PLX... the company I recommended in Dec 2016 that became a 3-bagger in less than 4 months. Still waiting on that dilution event for Protalix before looking at possible re-entry. We'll see what happens first... more dilution or some kind of great news drop to drive the price higher from here."
 u.will see. lol tang master...
I am assuming most on this board are long. Shorts are most likely getting their research somewhere else. Why did you invest in LJPC? Did your initial rationale for investing in this stock pan out?
