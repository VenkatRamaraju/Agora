 tang cruises the coast off laguna Beach eating lobster  and sipping dom peron thanks...
I see a steady climb in the weeks and months ahead.
The market has been going south for a solid month. it's the worst reduction since the Great depression. The only question now is when to start buying more.
"Technically - no more shocking stuff from Tidface and continued good fortune, next stop is $10, then $16, and then $22 -- higher."
"Traded this for small gains early this year. Happy for all the longs here! I'm glad someone is making money. I'm in oversold divi play SMLP and I'd be excited to get half the gains you guys have gotten today. Anyway, Congrats longs and make a ton!"
"Just listened to CC. They are very pleased with formulary approvals (exceeded their expectations), and optimistic about hospital interest, especially given the new medicare supplement payment to hospitals. I'm definitely long."
I increased my position at 5 29 today. we will see $7 by the end of next week.
"The selling has completely dried up. A close above $10.00 will signal a technical break out, and the stock will run."

"I am extremely bullish on LJPC -401. Haemochromatosis is iron overlad, and is toxic to the body. Left untreated, Haemochromatosis will lead to life-threatening diseases. Heart disease, Liver cancer, cirrhosis, Endocrine disorders, including diabetes, different cancers and infections. Haemochromatosis is the most common hereditary disorder in the world. 1 in 9 is a carrier, and more than 16 million Americans suffer from iron overload. LJPC -401 had tremendous results in phase one and is expected to have great reaults under the current patient study. Most investors are unaware of the seriousness of Haemochromatosis and the size of the population that is at risk. In conclusion, LJPC has two drugs that will create huge revenues that will justify much higher prices on the stock."
short interest dropped to 8.5 million (by more than 1 million on 12/20/2018).let's hope a lot more recent days
"More Giapreza/Xerava licensing agreements will be announced (Asia, Australia, MENA, SoAm)US FDA Approval for Giapreza around the cornerStreet will up PT (strong buy!)Institutional investors will flockQ1/2021 - $10 (min)"
I like the future prospects here.
"Around 10 is first threshold level, then it is 16, then 22, then around 32 to 34. We need 501 approval in Europe with a good distribution partner (Big Pharma hopely). Then some good positive sales numbers in US rest of the year. Then we should hit over 30 or possibly 40 by the year end. Holding."

"Hedge funds want to get all retail investors shares, this always happens with almost all biotech before the sp goes up . Tang know he would need to buy at 9 to 15 sp level to push the sp to mid 20 before accepting a buyout offer I personally don’t think anything less than 1.4 billion or 55 a share would be acceptable by ljpc board , the company will not last long … it has no reason if ljpc can sell 50 millions in us market with 120 employees , big pharmaceutical would sell easily 150 million with 88000 and that no counting Europe of the far east. Patient is the key here ."
Guys.. I am buying.. npow.. See it go up and thank me..
SNaidu can you be honest and tell us how much you are underwater in LJPC? You go around asking people about their personal stuff so I thought may be you are all about sharing your personal details. We might be a more accommodating and empathetic if we know what you are going through. So tell us how much you lost in LJPC and your total stake. Do you have other stocks and assets? List them and their value and if you have a mortgage or loan from your parents.... list them here. It's a beneign ask so dont think it would be a problem for you cupcake.
"Okkkkk ... so the brought it down for new ceo to have a buy options of 400k share for 3.89 and lowered a little more next day to cover that they did that ! , after all .50 cent for 400k share is 200k dollar , but now what are they going to get their act together and think that they have a shareholder or they are going to continue to act as if this is privately owned company, the company should be at 600 million market cap and it’s at 90 million and it seems like no one cares , worst case scenario Gia will sell 35 million in USA , the new antibiotic drug should sell over 20 million for 2021 according to their sec filing, now Europe should come to the arena with at least 35 million annually, the company have only sales rep the monthly cost should be 1 million or so only , and again this company is not a success story but I think if they prove that they can maintain over 100 million in sales annually, I don’t see any reason why big pharmaceutical companies won’t buy it for a round 1 b , which is around 45 a share"

"Zacks: Brokerages Expect La Jolla Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:LJPC) Will Announce Quarterly Sales of $6.90 Million, Posted by Shanna Eddington on Aug 16th, 2019Equities research analysts expect La Jolla Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:LJPC) to announce $6.90 million in sales for the current fiscal quarter, Zacks reports.

"Unless ljpc report less sales for 2q I don’t see any a reason why the company-shouldn’t be sold for 20 a share ... less than 500 mil . Tang now is the ceo and basically he is only assisting in the sales of Gia and maybe dealing with sales rep directly , he own 33% of the company so no one have more interest to sell the company than him ,Europe gia approval should be worth at least 150 mil , I don’t know what happen to successful ljpc 401 phase 2 but should be included in the sale , plus the newly bought antibiotic drug , I hope to see something happen in weeks or few months only ."
"La Jolla is expecting to hear from European regulators about a go/no-go decision on Giapreza in the second half of the year. If the regulatory decision is positive, the drug's addressable market opportunity could grow by more than half, so this remains a major catalyst for investors to look forward to.If you're bullish on Giapreza's potential and think that European regulators will give it the thumbs-up, then right now might not be a bad time to consider picking up a few shares."
"9.8 million (3 month LJPC and 2 months Tetra) == full Q Tetra probably @ 11 million.If revenue growth develops as Tang is hoping for 2X the current, we could hit 100 million and positive earnings ... could go for the price he is looking for!"
"Simon - yes it is worrisome, albeit it did get that prelim acceptance one year ago. Tyrant CEO has not mentioned EMA or vocal about it in the recent press releases. It was only in the footnotes."
no movement. Stagnant in the water. that's a shame
"Tang needs 3 to 6 months to mesh together the two companies, then sell it to a buyer."
We have a news from China Partner Everest Medicines Initiates.I’m sure we don’t get any news from LJPC
"They are building the company from the ground up , they will not sell it cheap, it might take a while and a rocky road to 50 a share but they will get it there , they will get the sales for up 80 million a year in the USA and Europe should be evaluated the same , I think in the way up tang capital will make over 200 millions just from sp swings, the company is very low capital and sp is very easily controlled and manipulated . 1 q of 2021 sales will determined the true evaluation of this company, I think 2021 is the year ljpc will be sold .ceo has option to buy 400 k share at 3.85 so he is going to do what ever possible to build the company the right way and improve the sale , Basically he have a chance to make 20 million in a year . it’s just a matter of time , I expect sp swings of 40% up and down while going up ,"

"$PRTK is valued at $200mil based on anticipated 2020 annual sales of $83mil. When buying a house or stock, one likes to look at comparatives before valuing that specific asset they want to purchase. Well here's a very simple and unmistakable comparison for you... a recent transaction WITHIN the antibiotics space was the acquisition of $TTPH by $LJPC. $LJPC will pay in total $59mil of compensation for $TTPH ($43mil upfront and $16mil in future). $TTPH only has one drug (XERAVA, an injection only, one indication drug) with anticipated 2020 annual sales of $7-10mil. Using simple math, PRTK should currently be valued at least 10x the value of this acquisition based on sales figures, thus valuing the company at $590mil. Thats by me using irrefutable mathematics comparing one asset to another. Throw in some soft characteristics comparisons like PRTK has 2 approved FDA drugs, one of which is owned by them, the other licensed off. The one owned and marketed by PRTK, omadacyline (Seysera) is approved for 2 indications, soon to be once daily oral or intravenous for both indcations. Not to mention the contract with the US government and the potential for many more purchases throughout the years moving forward. It is abundantly clear to me, this asset is significantly undervalued. Time for the investor base to wake up and smell the roses."

"Last story to Robbie - ""true story"". About 4 years ago, I called LJPC guy (CFO) to ask a question, somehow I got Tidmarsh. This is still early stages since LJPC took over a previous shell company so they actually answer and/or returns calls. I asked Tidmarsh a simple question about something (I can not remember). His response was very shocking and unexpected to me. He said if you don't like what we are doing, you can just sell. I did not sell at that time because of their inaccurate 501 sales projection, the stock seemed to be in progression as you put it Robbie. That is why it did not surprise me, when I read the earnings call transcripts, that the way Tidmarsh handles or interact with the analysts."
 tang at Chilli  festival Hatch New Mexico its fun...
It's coming!
"Drug is effective but Shorts have choked off the float. It takes about 12 months for hospital formularies and EMRs to adapt. Nothing mgmt can do about it. Assuming drug continues to perform well clinically (no half-life issues, adverse events), revenue should tick up. If revenue exceeds $40M per quarter, company can break-even, valuation is secure and shorts will exit slowly. Mgmt has no incentive to go for a quick buyout. Better for them to wait for revenue growth to accelerate beyond $40M and control their own destiny after that. The risk of failure is entirely on shareholders, not on mgmt. And that's why the stock is so low -- chances of failure are still high. But it will be proved out one way or the other in the next few quarters."
"Adam Feuerstein 2014 @RossKlos $GALT and $LJPC only cos. working on Galectin inhibitors (fruit pectin) for fibrosis, cancer, etc. $GALT is just as scary."
"Now whatIt's always a little silly when analyst estimates -- nothing more than predictions and forecasts -- wreak such havoc on a company's share price. The analysts were wrong, not La Jolla.Either way, the company is now valued at around $150 million. Is that a fair price or is the business undervalued? Well, La Jolla Pharmaceutical exited 2018 with nearly $172 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. It expects to use no more than $94 million in cash during the course of operations this year. That means the business could make it to the middle of 2020 before it needs to raise additional capital. There will be at least three significant updates from the pipeline between now and then, with two slated to occur in the second half of 2019.Therefore, while this company has a lot to prove before investors can decide it's a viable long-term business, it may be a good one to watch this year."
Anyone try calling Tang about changing LJPC status and way to sell 501?
"Had a call yesterday morning from the medical line. They wanted demographic info because they thought I may have had an adverse reaction. I told them to forward my enquiry to investor relations. Sandra Vedrick, director of investor relations and Human Resources sent me this via email...”Hello, Mr. ——— Thank you for your interest and support for La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company. We have recently addressed investors at the JP Morgan conference,you can find the replay on our website under investor relations.”So not much of an answer, but a callback and an email for the faithful here. Thought I would share...GLTA..."
"Looks like the beginning of a short squeeze. It took 1.4 million shares to bring price down $4 in one day.

"PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION - In the S-3 filing they disclose it might be shares, warrants or debt, and that they may sell them directly or through brokers or underwriters. That is all boilerplate, but what jumps out is that they did not announce an underwriter. So as of this moment it seems there is no immediate sale of the shares. They were just registered to be sold. I dont know what their intentions are or if they might start selling share At The Market (ATM) meaning just selling shares. The cap on the dollar value is $150 million so there is no fixed price and no set debt obligation or interest rate etc. Maybe we will get an announcement later. Maybe they won't sell any of the shares (though that seems unlikely)."
"Hold off selling till mid February. All the insiders sold large number of Jan and Feb calls at mid 30s.Once Feb options expire, you will see JP Morgan upgrade this to ""Strong Buy"" and slap on a 70 price target.Just another day in the market to pick pockets of retail investors."
Cowen analysts said LJPC has 400 - 500% upward potential with 2 approved drugs.
"This will close on green today , ljpc became a small cap and very easy to manipulate , it’s just a game they play have nothing to do with the performances the company which never had any leak of info before , an announcement of partnership with good sales it will go from 6 to 20 in a day"

 do the tang tango and watch your money rise if you get out now your in for a big surprise 
such easy money.This is a cycle over and over again with LJPC. Sorry buy its true.Look at the history and prove me wrong. I believe in the possibility of a buyout but not for many billions.maybe 2 or 3 at most which would be fine for my long position but it's too easy to go short almost weekly on this one wants she starts trending down. They just aren't selling the Gia and the abx has too much competition for large revenue for many many years..Show me differently
Tang at it again?! Sure we'll see another Form4 for LJPC later this week with TCP buying up more shares.
"I don't believe LJPC is a $300M company today but it will be. In the only article I could find on Giapreza in actual use, it is credited with saving the life of a retired coach in Michigan. With only about 300 hospitals stocking it according to the article I read. As more hospitals add it to their inventory, the results will multiply. This also adds to the likelihood of EU approval next month."

"> LJPC-0118 (I.V. artesunate) is La Jolla’s investigational product for the treatment of severe malaria. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in LJPC-0118, artesunate, was demonstrated to be superior to quinine in reducing mortality in patients with severe falciparum malaria infection in two randomized, active-controlled, clinical studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Orphan Drug designation for LJPC-0118 for the treatment of malaria in April 2019 and July 2019, respectively.< So how about this as a potential coronavirus drug if it's better than other anti-malarials out there? Hope they're looking into it"
Just my opinion but that take down yesterday might have been short sellers. The partnership news is big!!!! Hopefully we will keep running.

"You Betcha - Understood! You bought all your shares below $10 and you are happy. Before being critical of others, please put yourself in their shoes. Sincerely, what you may think Simon and I are not the same person. I am sure Simon is a good guy on his own but I so not want to be him as well as he would not want to be me. I believe we just have common feeling that Tidmarsh has done a horrific job and did nothing to help or enhance the marketing of 501 when it was apparent. He has done a terrible job of planning of 501 commercialization (he must never taken a business course of project / product planning)."
"We need EMA approval on 501 (plan and status of potential pharma partner), need some clear numbers on 118 revenue, clear 501 US marketing plan for increase promotion and sales (with new guy), and 401 projected sales (implementation phase and full phase). However, T's have 0 project planning (forward action) skills, we may be lost in a phone booth with Bobby, Robbie, and T's."

"The story here isn't that complicated. A lot more information to be released this week.Anupam Rama graduates from Boston University and moves to OH looking for analyst work. Joseph Edelman of Perspective Capital shows him the ropes of biomedical investments money dealings. After working with siphoning investors of few biotechs, Anupam Rama starts to make money for JPMorgan investment analyst team.Edelman feeds insider information is to Rama, who then manipulates the stock ratings via JPMorgan. Perspective Capital makes money as the stock travels both ways. Along the way, these guys run into Tang, an analyst who is moving onto bigger things. The Edelman-Rama duo gets miffed with Tang.Fast Forward 15 years.Perspective buys big into Tang's company. Edelman finds out when the FDA approval is due. At the right moment, Edelman creates huge short position against is own holdings. Rama berates the stock at the right moment. Edelman forces the board to dilute. Edelman covers. FDA approval comes out, the stock barely recovers. Having restricted the company's cash flow, Edelman pushes for another dilution. Tang digs his heels and makes a loan deal. Edelman wants another shot at the short/dilution cycle. Rama is exposed and JPMorgan has him on warning.Edelman is now short against the box, essentially neutral on his stock position. Perspective is on the board, but being neutral, they have no upside. In a desperate attempt, Perspective tries to make another run at shorting. JPMorgan gets inquiry by authorities who are looking into Rama's activities and offshore investments.JPMorgan forces Perspective's hand by reducing the number of days to cover. Short positions start to shrink. From Edelman's perspective, the light at the end of the tunnel may be a freight train. Rama is essentially a mute puppet watching this show from the sidelines.Tang may have a wide smile before the end of this week."
The Broadfin filed today sold all their shares. I hope we start going up now.

"On January 12, 2021, La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including La Jolla Pharma, LLC and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, “La Jolla”), entered into an exclusive licensing agreement (the “License Agreement”) with PAION AG and its wholly owned subsidiary (“PAION”) for GIAPREZATM (angiotensin II) and XERAVATM (eravacycline) in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (the “Licensed Territory”) whereby La Jolla will be entitled to receive an upfront cash payment of $22.5 million plus potential commercial milestone payments of up to $109.5 million and double-digit tiered royalty payments. PAION is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize GIAPREZA and XERAVA in the Licensed Territory.The foregoing description of the License Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the License Agreement, a copy of which will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to La Jolla’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020."
Institutional ownership is very impressive. A lot of recent accumulation and the statistics I’ve seen point to at least %90 holdings by big names.
"Speculations:1. First 401 Interim results are much, much better than originally thought2. 501 numbers are getting better3. 501 Europe approval is coming this month, maybe indicated done deal?4. Maybe Tidmarsh and Tang are entertaining the sale of the company, hopely over 1 billion"
"Giazpreza is going to be the new standard of care for septic shock:In the final rule concerning Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2019, CMS states that: “Based on the data provided by the applicant and consideration of the public comments we received, we agree with the applicant and the commenters that GIAPREZA represents a substantial clinical improvement over existing technologies because it quickly and effectively raises MAP while allowing for a reduction in other vasopressors.”"
"Too brilliant to be missed! Amazing DD @nickpd @R8Plus LJPC ended its fiscal year of 2019 with a bang, seeing its Giapreza revenue jumps 74% year over year compared to 2018. Much of these rev were the delayed reaction to its sale campaign since Critical Care Congress in 2019 where it was one of major sponsors. Hosts of new discovery about the use of Gia have steadily popped up in clinical literature and talks among practicing clinicians...Like any new drug, the launching process is typically an exercise of patience and perseverance, especially for a small bio co to go-at-it alone. With multiple tail winds 2020 such as Priority Voucher award ($90-$100M+ of nondilute financing), the pending FDA approval of artesunate, EU launch of Gia, Surviving Sepsis Campaign high probability of guideline’s inclusion for Gia, and more cardiac usage in CABG, vasoplegia, etc, we expect share price to appreciate considerably as more events unfold in days ahead. We are long in LJPC.https://writer.zohopublic.com/writer/published/bnmzk9998173e21714a869d9db6d4ca47a5cc"
$5 will be the new floor. Learn how to read the chart kids!
I am assuming most on this board are long. Shorts are most likely getting their research somewhere else. Why did you invest in LJPC? Did your initial rationale for investing in this stock pan out?
"why would you sell, how much more bullish info do you need than the huge amount of skin in the game Tang just did?"
8.7 mil in drug revenue for the Q is low compared to 11 mil last Q? Hope this will improve this Q and this year. Hope we get a lot revenue from EU and China going forward. Hope Tang can get $15+ by end of this year.
26+ million shares outstanding with 14+ million share float on LJPC.9+ million shares shorted. Time for shorties to get out while they can!
"Bob Sharma (Seeking Alpha) interprets latest trial results:""One of the key news was the survival benefit shown by La Jolla Pharmaceuticals' (LJPC) angiotensin II formulation Giapreza in a posthoc analysis in patients with distributive shock (which is commonly septic shock) and acute kidney injury, AKI who required renal replacement therapy. Despite showing successful phase 3 results in the ATHOS 3 trial in distributive shock, bears have always been skeptical about the commercial potential of Giapreza (although it helped achieve the target blood pressure at 3 hours in significantly higher number of patients vs. placebo), the reason being that the ATHOS 3 trial failed to show a difference in mortality between the drug arm and the placebo. The NEJM paper publishing the ATHOS 3 data clearly mentioned that the trial was not powered to show a mortality benefit. The stock has doubled in last year, still, bears have always been skeptical. Hopefully, the data from today will silence the bears. AKI is very commonly seen in septic shock (53% incidence as per this paper). About 89% of these patients with AKI and septic shock may require renal replacement therapy (like dialysis or hemofiltration). The data released today showed higher survival in these patients at day 28 of follow-up (53% vs. 30%, p=0.012). Additional benefit seen in AKI subgroup could be due to the homeostatic effect of angiotensin II in maintaining glomerular filtration rate. The data could increase the commercial adoption of Giapreza."""
hoping to see this stock double from today price of 4.21 within 6 months or beforelong term investor.
if i was short - i get out now. big hedge fund or jpmorgan short - i take this up to 45 and get out now. or else they may not be able to get out until 60 to 90? 90 would be 3 billion price tag fully diluted 33 mil shares

"$LJPC $ONCS $INO LJPC will have quite a large market in Europe with these doctor requests for Giapreza and word getting out as the superior drug for septic shock. The U.S. is sure to follow. I'd be surprised if they don't get attention from a Big Biotech for a BO eventually.They would be able to manufacture Giapreza on a large scale and utilize their own sales force. Check out ONCS, another company involved with Covid-19. They are working with INO and Providence for their products to be used with their vaccines."
Formulary approval by 500+ hospitals by end of year. 1000+ by this time next year. The loss today is just on paper - hang in there.
"Just wondering this tidsah is not ashamed of him self , many investors holding for above 30 for many years to be rewarded of 30% drop . While he still making millions a year and surely in that conference he don’t like to talk about money (he is above that ) he will pass the micro to someone else to talk about money ."
"Beware of ""Marc "" who repeatedly claims that LJPC will be bought out. If you look at Marc's prior posts, he also claims to be a research analyst for a large hedge fund. I hold a large position with LJPC and am long, but talk of a BO is pure speculation. If you're looking to invest in LJPC, research their drug Giapreza and it's increase of market share."

"Just had my 3rd bagger stock since Aug.

I did all this with some portion of the funds coming from selling 100% of $PLX... the company I recommended in Dec 2016 that became a 3-bagger in less than 4 months. Still waiting on that dilution event for Protalix before looking at possible re-entry. We'll see what happens first... more dilution or some kind of great news drop to drive the price higher from here."
Market cap 120 millions. Cash 82 millions. Good pipelines. I can't be more bullish.
Only algo's trading between themselves few shares. No one is selling.
"Tang is the only one with the real inside information, retail investors are in the dark (European partner!, is Gia sales improving in a big way or just a small increase quarter after quarter, do ljpc have a joint team for the sale of the antibiotic drug and Gia , how much is ljpc 401 successful phase 2 is worth , ) he will share some information with biggest institutions investors (I’am not sure if that even legal) but he will do it either way ."
"A broker told me that LJPC is on their NTB “no shares available to borrow” list, and that is a rare thing. . I checked at another broker, they say there are 150,000 shares available to borrow. It is still a small number next to the total of 8.4 million shares short.Why don’t the large owners put a hurting’ on the shorts? Maybe they will after the Q2 earnings. Tang and Edelman are both 10% holders so they may have to wait until after a quiet period to buy more, if they are even going to buy more. Either way this is a potential powderkeg. If the Q2 revenues show strong Giapreza sell-in there is no telling what may happen. It would be even better if they had some guidance showing good sell through in July. LJPC is trading at a market cap of apx $800 million, which is low for a company with a new drug that will save 100,000+ lives a year. Gia is a potential blockbuster but trades for less than a developmental stage biotech. How many people even know about this company? LJPC only has 26 million shares outstanding, but the top 30 funds and institutions hold 27 million shares. Tang Capital holds an additional 4.1 million shares. George Tidmarsh owns more than 1 million. I also found a fund by the name Consonance Capital that reported to the SEC a 2 million share position, which would make them the 5th largest holder of LJPC – but for some reason the reporting bureaus didn’t list them as a top holder. Skimming the filings I saw that there are a number of medium sized hedge funds based out of New York that have significant holdings in LJPC. I wonder if they are “related” entities or share ideas with each other. Anyway add all that up and it comes to 34.1 million shares held by the largest investors. Since there are only 26 million shares outstanding, subtract 26 million from the 34.1 million in the hands of the top holders and we get a sum of 8.1 million. That is pretty darn close to the total number of shares shorted. It leaves 300,000 left over. But shouldn’t there be many other investors, funds and groups that do not report their holdings? Wouldn’t you expect there to be more than 300,000 shares held by non-reporting investors? So this stock continues to confound me. But if the stock cannot be shorted anymore, then some of the shorts might fail to deliver which in theory would force them to buy back in. Buying in obviously gives the price life. If we get great Q2 numbers that spark a rally in the share price coupled with the inability of the shorts to short any more, and possibly a requirement to buy-in their shorts… wel the stock has potential to move by big leaps and bounds. Even if the Q2 numbers come in poor, which I doubt, all these shorts will give some buoyancy to the stock as the shorts use any pullback to cover."

"June 27, 2018. The day bottom slides out of LJPC. Game Over."
"Prudential sold out 90% of holding (3.3 million shares).3.3 mil Prud, 3.3 mil Jennison, 1.3 mil Perceptive - 8 to 9 million shares out. Let's see how much of that shorts took?Tidmarsh has to deliver with much, much better 501 revenues than his estimated projection!"
6.7 million shares short 1/15/2019! Down again. Good news for longs. Shorts diminished.
"Now we know why it was down the last 2 days, someone knew about the offering.I was really hoping for a quick buyout but the stock will likely be more successful with LJPC producing everything plus they have over 300 employees so needed the money"
If Tidmarsh announces Tuesday that he have a partner in Europe (hopefully Roche) stock will double few weeks later and anther announcement for the 3rd quarter sales of 7.5 mil + and the stock should go anther 50% and we are back to the normal of $35 a share
"Should be NO more cash crunch going forward, and concentrate on increasing revenue in US and may make deals in Asia, S. Korea? Tang is one his way to sale this company! Great news for us long long suffering longs."
"Last chance today to buy the $28 call option for tomorrow's closing. This thing will fly over the weekend. Buying a in the money call optin today will give you a free ride over the weekend.When the stock open at $34 on Monday, you get a free ride. :-)"
"Edward's job to grow revenue and not Tang. Tang probably has lot more issues with his other holdings. If both drugs sells, even not that well, the revenue will go up 2X, 3X even if US stays or growths slightly."
"We need a little bit of luck, even a miracle, to have 501 revenue to accelerate. Need EU approval and a partner. We need these to come to fruition. Need 30 to 40. Will unload 75% at that point and see."
