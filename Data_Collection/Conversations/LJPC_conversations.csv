"Rumor is, Tang hiding NDA Application for Malaria in the bad news, to sell priority review voucher to Big Pharma+the rest of the assets (Cash, approved Medicine, ...). FDA Priority review voucher IS TRADABLE. Happened in the past, can bring between 68-300Mill. $+ ... more than current mcap. Would explain as well, why Malaria was NEVER really mentioned and talked about company wise, and in no presentation. And now the news hidden in the ousting of CEO.Im speculating Tang selling LJPC 20$+ soon. Wait for news of priority review from FDA ...ALL IMO"

"Bet LJPC-0118 progress is just around the corner, hence why Tang keeps buying up all the shares. Remember this (below) from 2yrs ago? Wonder how they're doing now? Can you imaging what would happen to LJPC share price if FDA grants EUA? POW!!!!!In the meantime, KT/LE much more patient than us, guess we'll just have to wait and see!!!https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/24/1808817/0/en/La-Jolla-Pharmaceutical-Company-Announces-U-S-FDA-s-Grant-of-Breakthrough-Therapy-Designation-for-LJPC-0118-for-the-Treatment-of-Severe-Malaria.html"

"9.8 million (3 month LJPC and 2 months Tetra) == full Q Tetra probably @ 11 million.If revenue growth develops as Tang is hoping for 2X the current, we could hit 100 million and positive earnings ... could go for the price he is looking for!"
"Just listened to CC. They are very pleased with formulary approvals (exceeded their expectations), and optimistic about hospital interest, especially given the new medicare supplement payment to hospitals. I'm definitely long."
"Hedge funds own 44% of the shares and they control the direction, the same hedge funds also have a short position, they need to take this red to cover that. They are trading giant blocks to each other to drive this down. Buy all you can and steal from them on the way down. I think the consolidation will last a couple more days, average down as much as you can."
