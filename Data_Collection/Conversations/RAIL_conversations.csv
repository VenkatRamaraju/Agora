Railroads have been flourishing through this pandemic. The need for new equipment is on the rise. Insider trading is on the rise on this stock. This one is going to go parabolic once the market realizes this hidden gem.
FreightCar America is up 9.03% to 4.59
becuz they just moved to Mexico to avoid lazy high waged union loafers.

"The railroad car manufacturing has been under pressure for some time. Meyer took over in July 2017 as the decline increased. Low cost manufacturing from China and such cut into production and profit margins bringing us to declining freight shipments which were moving to the trucking industry. Throw in a pandemic and Rail is on the ropes. Meyer and company were making plans of moving production to lower cost and the pandemic hastened the decision. Bringing some new thinkers such as Rogers, (CFO), has helped Rail get on better financial footing bringing us to now. New lower cost manufacturing site, increasing backlog of orders, new building lines to double production in a year plus with the added tax benefits offered for removing old and building new rail cars, things are looking pretty good.Its not all rosy for Rail, but these sp levels good be a great spot to take a postion. Just my take on this old company. Who knows, at these levels, Greenbriar or others might be looking to pick up a bolt on to help with their increasing backlog. GLTA>"
I found this stock on the site (help://pickaloser.con) It's a very eye opening service that gets it.
"IS RAIL a SCAM stock..HOW do you lose 75% of your Revenue in 3 years, in a relevant business ??Revenue $100+m from $400+m.. That's the kind SCAM, as if Management are stooges, agents working for shorts, intentionally sabotaging, or bigger players scamming..?I still feel like buying 2000"
Must be close to resolving the infrastructure issue.
"I agree RAIL has potential, but you should also check out NTP. If October 8 court ruling is in favor of activists and full value can be realized gains would be large."
"RAIL has a long history of being a $20 to $40 dollar stock, but the bottom fell out in the summer of 2018 and it's never recovered. Can someone provide a little historical background on why the stock fell so badly in 2018 and has never recovered? Was there some sort of bad merger, acquisition, or scandal that so badly damaged the stock?"
