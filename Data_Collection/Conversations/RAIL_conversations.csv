"RAIL almost $150 mil backlog. Castanos Mexico margins should prove to be extraordinary in 2021 and 2022. 2 analyst firms cover it. Under promise, over deliver. EPS crushing 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q"
Thinking of taking some profit on 1000 shares today then buying on a dip next week... This stock so volatile.. What do you guys think?
railroads haven't started ramping up to meet demand. orders for rail cars will come

Told you 4 hours ago what it would do-if everyone bought and held on.knew it would break that $6 barrrier..
IF you go to company profile item 8.01 the company disclosed that in April it received 10 million dollars for PPP under the Cares act and most importantly the whole amount including interest was forgiven in its entirety on July 14th balance owing ZERO
looking good hovering around previous day highs... potential for morning spike if markets are good... GLTA
"GBX - 1.33 Billion MC. TRN - 2.74 Billion MC. Just read quarterly transcripts and both companies are going to be maxed out for capacity soon. Building, rebuilding, repurposing railcars, scrapping... all segments seem to be expanding. Rail is looking to add 2 more lines to keep up with the demand they are seeing. Steel prices are a problem for all but seem to have no trouble passing increases on to protect profit margins. I think GBX had like 650 million on hand with another 250 million revolving credit line. I wonder if RAIL has a price tag on it. Mmm. Just some thoughts."
How many more times will @RAIL go up 10% or more then drop right back down 10% or more like I said before maybe I should start talking advantage of this pattern.
This is a 20 dollar stock on the business and financials. It is a 400 dollar stock if Reddit stock pickers pick this as the next place to burn a hedge fund.
On a site note All Whiners will be banned from This Board!
The 50 is about to cross under the 200. Not good.
I definitely bought more on this Dip now let's climb up with earnings in 5 days
"Check my posts. I have never cried that a stock is being manipulated.I believe this one is, but I'll trade it anyhow once my charts reveal the underlying psychology- FYI. that's all charts really do."
"Wow Jim Meyer said he is seeing a potential m#$%$ive turn this year and they are ready. They had a gross profit of 9% from a negative -16 last year. They are seeing increasing orders and inquiries and are ready and preparing for a huge possible ramp in orders. This call was one of the best I have heard in the last 3 years from any company I have stock in. They are gonna kick some rail car #$%$ and are totally prepared to do it. The only thing they have to figure out is the doubling in steel costs, but they are better at engineering and profitability than any other rail car company. They are gonna rip the cover off the rail car tops by the second half of this year. It is going to happen, they are doing a fantastic job. This is a $20/ share stock by the end of this year."
At first glance the report looks pretty good all things considered. Have to check out a copy of the call tonight and see if this ship is really turning around.
"RAIL is going to be over $3 a share by Christmas, great time to buy. They are setting themselves for a big year and own all their own production."
cn $30 billion bid to acquire kansas city huge demand shipping up economy opening growth infrastructure rail is at crossroads of all growth railways need to service existing railcars they need more railcars they need them now rail will have to operate at 100% capacity for next few years to keep up with demand
"RAIL and XBIO gonna breakout next week. Maybe starting today! Watching NVNXF, HIMX and BGFV."
Price Target Set at $ 29.00-3 days ago...Huge upside...solid company. For all penny flipping retail investors-you have to realize how to actually manage your portfolio and do yourself the most good..Let your moneyride up at least a few dollars-not a few cents..before you panic and sell..With a companylike this you'll be happy you did..This is NOT DOGECOIN..
FreightCar America is up 9.11% to 4.91
Now that Castellanos Mfr is in place and running full ahead the focus should now fall on the back log of nearly 2000 freight cars and how quickly they can deliver. With positive margins now assured thanks to lowest cost production and no tariffs Company can focus on manufacturing and filling its orders. Ultimately the cash crisis has been solved with new $40mm financing in place.Shorts are covering - see short interest has been halved in the past month.PIMCO stake of 20% shows they have the institutional endorsement in their business plan and backing needed to move the stock higher.
Timber....that didn't take long to take 50% haircut.
"Hi All,I am not a stock prognosticator. The value of the stock is $5 as far as I can tell right now from the options expiry. Enough of us believed that the stock is worth that much at least to defend it like we did on Friday. Options expiry is a clearinghouse for price discovery. That is why the option market exists as it helps in price discovery. Obviously some of us felt that the stock is worth $5 and that's how we traded. I had no position going in but now I do because if anyone wrote naked puts on it then they must cover.For those who were with me on that trade, we would probably buy puts at $10. I don't know that the stock is worth more than that.IMHO. Maybe. Not yet. But it is worth more than $5, and we said yes and put our money where our mouths are. That is what options are all about. Options expiry is clearing the house on price so to speak.Friday was a perfect example of free market trade. For you new folks, study what happened and understand why it happened. Make sure that you understand options expiry dates on stocks and especially so if you are going to try to trade them.You've noticed that I don't comment on other stocks and that I have a new account. I created it for this stock alone. This is a good stock for new investors/traders to learn on because it has value and is a real company and has a very low float. I can't tell you what the price will do and you'll never hear me say something like it's ""going to the moon"". It's not going to go to the moon nor should it."
Shorts are panicking. This come was 35% YOY sales last year. Have revised the delivery to double he amount of railcars delivered last year
"Provides second half fiscal 2020 outlook to deliver 750 to 1,000 railcarsAnnounces start of production at the Castaños, Mexico joint venture plant"
they need sales to sustain this move
"Lee, I've looked at the cosl cars report and sales have been ticking upwards since December, so WRONG!!! Loading up."
When it breaks $7 it is going to fly!!
Load up! Easy money to be made.
6.70 is previous high.. We've been trading in that range for a while.. Consolidating.. Could be a nice spike tomorrow
I suppose they'll need more freight cars to move that oil thanks to the keystone shutdown.
The July calls around 7.5 and 10 tell me someone is shorting and hedging their bets or someone sold some options because they don't think the stock will hit 7.5 or 10.
"Never seen a chart for a solid company like this-play such games. UP .40 then down $1.00 minute by minute it seems-every day. How does this happen? 50% of the float is held by institutions and insiders -so they aren't trading. Guess it's the shorts and retail investors playing havoc with the stock price. The company is 100 years old, has a backlog of orders, great financial outlook..go figure.."
Company is a major beneficiary of the infrastructure bill. Move to Mexico was well known and enables RAIL to compete as the lowest cost producer of Rail Containers. New direction propels this much higher. Really a great turnaround story.
"Thanks Joe-for thee kick in the teeth today..who voted for this guy?""The Labor Department reported the consumer price index jumped 4.2% year over year. This was above economists' forecast for a 3.6% increase. It was also the highest inflation rate since September 2008""."
SO MONDAY WE TRADE 3 MILLION SHARES BETWEEN 5.25 AND 6.00 AND THEN EVERBODY JUST DISAPPEARS?????
"IS RAIL a SCAM stock..HOW do you lose 75% of your Revenue in 3 years, in a relevant business ??Revenue $100+m from $400+m.. That's the kind SCAM, as if Management are stooges, agents working for shorts, intentionally sabotaging, or bigger players scamming..?I still feel like buying 2000"
"Oh I told them buy this one an sell that one. Mumble, Mumble, Mumble"
"I’ve been in since .77 and have a huge lot. This was $30 10 years ago. Rising in tandem with steel, polycarbonate, copper stocks. Same set up as 2007-08"
new orders will drop right to bottom line huge growth ahead even if competitors beat out rail on a few large orders they cant handle the huge growing demand for rail cars RAIL will be a key player in expansion of railways capacity to meet growing demand for next several years
Something is brewing unless funds are dumping. Volume highly unusual again. Stock is still up less than .10% for the year.
This one is now on the Reddit & Robinhood hit list.....hold to yo hats folks......
"building position here railways require 10's of thousands of railcars and are in great environment for infrastructure rebuild and economy reopening shortages in everything pent up demand everything is on a railway at some point need more cars, more maintenance, one large order for rail could triple current stock price on such a low float low priced stock company"
huge $30 billion dollar railway takeover bids gives you an idea from the inside of the forecasted growth in this area
Told you the last few days were a False Bounce. Now let the Plunge Continue!!
where are the sales
I believe earnings to prove strong due to covid 19 virus. Why? Because companies usually to busy to sideline a railcar and have had the opportunity to get them repaired or replaced during the slowdown.
Projections is that RAIL will grow 24% this coming year!
what do you guys think I've only been trading for the past five months. I've noticed that every time rail goes up 10% or more it shoots back down the next day. So do you guys think it would be wise for me to sell on a day like this lock in profits and try to buy back in on Monday if it goes down but I'm nervous to do that because my average is less then $5. So Should I put a stop loss a little bit below SP or sell all and hope it goes back down and buy back in for cheep all advice is welcome and thanks my fellow Rail family.
"Heavy volume day, would nice to have a good earning for once. God knows it has been a long, long time."
no available shares to short... https://fintel.io/ss/us/rail
To other investors in this stock: I'd like to explain to you that this was options expiry Friday. Some of us are not new traders. We noticed a large amount of puts being built against this stock so we backed off and let the price drop. Until today. There was no way we were going to push it over $5 though.If you don't understand that is OK but you won't have to worry about this again for at least a little while. This had nothing to do with the value of the underlying asset. This was about trading.
It goes down in 1-3 days because people are buying with margin. So it's a great way to start short when there's a gain. Hedges do it all the time
"Volume 31,039,911Avg. Volume 1,239,793Kinda says it all doesn't it.If my maths are correct, we had 30x average volume traded on this stook yesterday.Impossible to maintain."
Anyone telling you RAIL is going to pull back with two weeks until a positive earnings announcement is trying to steal some cheap shares. We should see $10 maybe Monday then we move steadily up from here just like in the past 12 months. Infrastructure is getting lots of political attention and will continue to do so throughout the year. The super low float of this stock has already changed hands between 5.50 and 7.00 once and now again between 7 and 8's. There is no one willing to sell at a loss and no shares left to trade without moving the price UP. All in my humble opinion but this week we shall all see.
Seems to be shorts are forced to cover. It used to be in teens in end of 2018. Added in mid 2.00 and hoping for the best. Good luck to all
"Why RAIL Rev dropped to 135m from $400+ million 2017..??What on earth happened, what caused the Revenue wipeout.??Thanks in advance"
Must be close to resolving the infrastructure issue.
I heard about RAIL the other day on the site (http://pickalooser.com) it's what got me interested here!
"Tons of HF selling today..man their algorithms are tough to beat..This is a greatstock as all have commented but just like #RAIL, another great stock with fabulous ERthese HF just continue to short the hell out of them killing momentum. Hoping for a comeback tomm"
This was expected. Bridge's and Highways hasn't happened quite yet. I take this with a grain of salt and look to future cost effective revenues. That was the whole point of the move to Mexivo to cut out the pork belly of wasteful spending.
"Lots of profit taking today plus a red market day.. Still very bullish.Backlog of orders, agriculture season coming which means morerailcars and tons of shipping now between Mexico to Canada.With gas prices going up-RAIL is the most efficient way to ship.."
"This one is deflating. Sell Mumble,Mumble, Mumble."
Stock is overvalued. Expect it to trend back down to about $3.
I dropped all my $tkat to get into $Rail .... the trian is leaving buddies
Small O.S. thinly traded= highly volatile. Wild swings but super upward trend. Infrastructure baby!
They are expanding in January. Just a matter of time now.
crazy volume...doesn't make sense?
whats up y'all I just started a small position yesterday morning in the beginning of the pop in sp but I'm holding for at least a year I think there's a lot of tail winds Rail can ride up we'll see
I wonder why folks are in a rush to sell when it adds another dollar? so many paper hands... SAD!
"Missed $0.16 but this was probably expected with the move? Delivery outlook looks good.The company is successfully ramping up the new manufacturing footprint in Castaños which will support a 2021 delivery outlook of between 1,400 to 1,600 railcars, or nearly double last year’s total production."
Rail is a good investment story now. They have gotten the factory in castanow up and running. 1500 rail cars for 2021. Bookings of 134M backlogs. Wednesday first phase of infrastructure bill unveiled. Would be patriotic to support our country and companies. Go RAIL.

"A few weeks ago this traded about 5O million shares over a 2 day period. this classic ""sell the news"" thing today is meaningless. this is likely a multi year turn around underway"
Back above $6 today
Looks like this ends up being a smart move to recovery. A wholly owned company with lowered cost margins.
A lot of talk Sunday morning on infrastructure. Go RAIL!!!
"This is a very Bullish Chart, traders! https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts"
RAIL stock price moving up more than likely due to renewed investor interest as the recovery for RAIL gets underway for the foreseeable future.
When is there quarterly release?Today?
becuz they just moved to Mexico to avoid lazy high waged union loafers.
up today Somebody Nose Sumptin.
Took a look at the call and a couple things came up that will keep me on the sidelines. 1) No new orders since July. 2) Breakeven as a company is improving but no clear indication where that is or if it will ever be possible at current volume. 3) A lot of hope that this is the bottom of the market.
Major Fund Pimco just took a 20% stake in them thats why
This amazing day is what happens when investors don't sell for pennies..Great job everyone!!!
They had some interesting insights about RAIL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Holding strong... Patience shall reward those who ride this tiger.
"Projected earnings Report on May 10-make this stock $ 15-20 minimum.Getting in under $10 on a stock that used to be $50 plus is a gift. As infrastructuregets built-iron, steel, ore etc will need to be transported and it wont be by Amazon..."

"any news today,15 millions shares changed hands,there are not that many shares outstanding?"
"Terms and Structure of this $40M loan? From what they say the loan is conditional upon approval of shareholders and is fully secured by all assets of the company except working capital. If approved the lender gets a warrant for 23% of the company's outstanding shares at a $0.01 per share. So it's a loan, therefore p&i... so what is the interes?t, or is it the 23% of the company they're giving away? Somehow shareholders here seem to be getting screwed once again by this company... even when it's ""good news"".... the share price somehow isn't impressed and always seems to tank. The way this company's been run a 5 year old with brain damage could've done a better job."
this company was one of my best stocks to swing trade  looking to get back in but u guess a day to late anyways good job the ones who gave this
Railroads are going to be the only way to get goods to people!!
"$10 plus stock masquerading as a bottom feeder. Have to pick some up here at 1.26, and thank you very much. If people only understood how much rail cars and rail freight move product and resource in this continent you wouldn't hesitate at grabbing a block of shares and holding onto them."
GBX is overpriced and RAIL should be $25-$35
Very light volume post Easter Monday-it will be lucky to hold $6.00 today-but still very bullish..
No news. No volume. Hold tight. We're fine.
rail is tough to do technicals on with little action in pre or post markets and low float and often very low volume just before explosive upward moves on high volume
These guys never cease to disappoint on earnings. Future looks a little better but watch the MM play this stock down to $ and back up thru out next 60-90 days
Guess what Stocks go up over Time! Real one's I mean. Real estate goes up over Time too. Duh. If you don't know that you can go over to the time a ninny.con board and Worry.
Railroads have been flourishing through this pandemic. The need for new equipment is on the rise. Insider trading is on the rise on this stock. This one is going to go parabolic once the market realizes this hidden gem.
16 million shares outstanding. 25% held by insiders. 25% held by institutions. 16 million shares traded on Friday with 8 million shares of float. Churn!
"The railroad car manufacturing has been under pressure for some time. Meyer took over in July 2017 as the decline increased. Low cost manufacturing from China and such cut into production and profit margins bringing us to declining freight shipments which were moving to the trucking industry. Throw in a pandemic and Rail is on the ropes. Meyer and company were making plans of moving production to lower cost and the pandemic hastened the decision. Bringing some new thinkers such as Rogers, (CFO), has helped Rail get on better financial footing bringing us to now. New lower cost manufacturing site, increasing backlog of orders, new building lines to double production in a year plus with the added tax benefits offered for removing old and building new rail cars, things are looking pretty good.Its not all rosy for Rail, but these sp levels good be a great spot to take a postion. Just my take on this old company. Who knows, at these levels, Greenbriar or others might be looking to pick up a bolt on to help with their increasing backlog. GLTA>"
More volume than the total number of outstanding shares if I am reading this right??
With the reopening and the bottleneck at the Suez Canal we are skyrocketing this week!!!!!

Holding until at least May earnings And I’ll go from there￼
So I was thinking about trying to learn to swing trade a couple positions I have but the problem I have a lot of times is I don't pull my profits out in time. So the ? I have is should I follow the stock that is going up with my stop loss set a little behind it so I can keep some of the profits if it comes back down because most of the time when it runs up it comes back down the next day or two and I miss out on I profit so that's why I was thinking I should set my stop loss behind it a little bit so if it goes down I could take out my profits

"I don't own any RAIL, but I might if I find a good entry. I do not see how this once $70 stock can be this low. RR is the only realistic means to transport large quantities like coal, livestock, automobile parts, , etc for long distances and the main way to recover imports form China and elsewhere. Driverless trucks do not have the capacity (at any cost) to move massive freight long distances. With the USMCA and China (supposedly) buying AG, it seems like this stock should not be so disliked by fund managers."

Why would they not liquidate the company at this level? Cash is @ $5/share and I’m sure even at scrap prices the equipment/land/building is worth $1/ share. If you are forecasted to lose money and have lower revenue from here on out why hold on just payout shareholders and shut it down.

Melinda Gates is now the biggest shareholder of Canadian Nat Railway. Great unintended consequences. And large owner of AutoNation. You gotta ship by rail and you need railcars to do it.
"RAIL has a long history of being a $20 to $40 dollar stock, but the bottom fell out in the summer of 2018 and it's never recovered. Can someone provide a little historical background on why the stock fell so badly in 2018 and has never recovered? Was there some sort of bad merger, acquisition, or scandal that so badly damaged the stock?"
