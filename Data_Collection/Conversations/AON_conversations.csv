"Aon ""India"" isn't too happy either -Below is a recent posting from Glassdoor dot com Doesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Aon (More than a year)ProsNo pros in configuration work. You are dead in IT if you do such a work even as a fresher. They are making fresher's sign bond now lol as experienced people don't join them and fresher's also leave in frustration because their life is made miserably hell using continuous bombardment of emails.They pay some experienced people a little more so that they do not get other job as they won't already as skills accor… Show MoreConsSeniors if biased from you irritate people to an extent that they are mentally tortures, if the person still copes it up,they kick people off using Improvement plan wherein they kick off people in 1 month if they do not improve. Obviously they don't improve.If you don't work 12 hours u are not working good, if you work 8 hours i.e syandard time your performance is zero according to them.Advice to ManagementGo to hell you managers.. who are eating Aon from inside since past 10-11 years.. these people are very old at AON and in ground reality their job is to irritate most of the subordinates to show their performance."

Another restructuring program justlike last year.The numbers were good, but stock price was upBut those expense items still had to be cut.So he called in dear Christa, a woman of fact to find out new ways to trim down the fat.""The Payroll is down through workforce reductions, eliminating many redundant job functions.We've cut here and there, and cut through the night, wiped out whole departments, yet nothing is right.

Comments by most reviews on Glassdoor - employees are under-paid and generally leave after a short stint- just learned that one of my old colleagues from more than a few years ago (six figure income) got tired of the Case BS rules and jumped ship in 2015. You do not do that unless things are really bad. BTW - what the hell is the hockey team doing for revenue?
This company is a hot mess. Been trying to get thru to customer support and the number does not work. WHAT A WRECK OF A COMPANY! BEEN DISCONNECTED THREE TIMES BY THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT! I WOULDN'T TAKE THE STOCK IF IT WAS OFFERED FOR FREE!

Aon is now one with itself. Aon has retired the Benfield and Risk Solutions brands to be just....Aon.kinda reminds me of.....The Borg - We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.
The fake news on buying Willis Towers Watson made someone a huge amount of money.All large trades should be thoroughly investigated for a connection to this fraud.

You KNOW it's Christmas when........Aon announces another layoff. Yep....Aon just advised the employees of the recently acquired firm of Stroz Friedberg who's losing their job. Naturally...it's the lower level IT help desk of Stroz Friedberg that's going first.

So...a friend of mine that works for Stroz Friedberg told me that they just found out about the Aon buy-out.Told him....Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated. Welcome to the Borg.

"This is a strong company that is stable and always growing. The dividend is low, but its a safe place to put money especially as new tax laws threaten inheritance, wealthy people will be flooding insurance companies to buy whole life insurance policies and other financial instruments to protect generational wealth.

"Black Thursday AnniversaryToday marks the 10th anniversary of Black Thursday, otherwise known as Joe's Big Lie. Ten years ago today, Joe Propati walked into the Houston office and announced Aon was closing the Houston ACS - after promising twelve employees from LA, and twelve from NY who relocated there to keep their jobs with Aon that ""Aon has no intentions of closing the Houston ACS"".And...Joe and Aon made no effort to make sure these twenty-four employees were given jobs elsewhere in the Houston office.That's how good Aon treats their employees."
