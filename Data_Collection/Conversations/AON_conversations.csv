"Written more than a few years ago --- and still true.HOW THE CASE STOLE CHRISTMASEvery colleague at Aon liked Christmas alot.But the Case, who lived just north in Chicago, did not.The Case hated Christmas, the whole expense driven season.Oh Please don't ask why, I don't quite know the reason.It may be because his belt was too tight.It may be because his head was McKinsied all right.But I think that the most likely reason of allWas that that it meant Holiday Bonuses, not small.But whatever the reason, his belt or McKinseyThe Case stood there Christmas eve hating the whimsy.For tomorrow he knew they were all expecting to see Quite rather large paychecks expressly from ME.Of writing those checks he could not allow.Of that he was certain, the problem was HOW.Then a thought came along, an evil idea. Another restructuring program just like last year.The numbers were good, the stock price was upBut those nasty expenses still had to be cut.So he called in dear Christa, a woman of fact to find out new ways to trim down the fat.""The Payroll is down through workforce reductions, eliminating many redundant job functions.We've cut here and there, and cut through the night, wiped out whole departments, yet nothing is right. Thousands are still on the books, don't you see. We've got to get it down to a count of just three.""So the very next day at the quarterly call, the Case made an announcement ending it all.""The jobs here are gone, we'll offshore the lot, to India and China and maybe Bangkok. Of here there is nothing, and once overseas, it's cheaper and faster and better, you'll see.""And with safe harbor statements legally binding, the Case closed the call while others were findingThat if Christmas carried slightly less cheer ... they could afford to be patient, there was always next year."
"What are your thoughts about the DOJ's beef with the AON & WTW merger? The uncertainty is playing havoc with Aon's stock price IMHO, and the late November trial date is no help. I'm not sure whether to hold, sell or even possibly buy the dip right now. Thoughts?"

"Black Thursday AnniversaryToday marks the 10th anniversary of Black Thursday, otherwise known as Joe's Big Lie. Ten years ago today, Joe Propati walked into the Houston office and announced Aon was closing the Houston ACS - after promising twelve employees from LA, and twelve from NY who relocated there to keep their jobs with Aon that ""Aon has no intentions of closing the Houston ACS"".And...Joe and Aon made no effort to make sure these twenty-four employees were given jobs elsewhere in the Houston office.That's how good Aon treats their employees."
"Do not forget that each and every Holiday season, there are 176 open spots at the tables of those families whose loved ones never came home on ""that day"" some 16 years ago."
The fake news on buying Willis Towers Watson made someone a huge amount of money.All large trades should be thoroughly investigated for a connection to this fraud.

"Nobody comments here, guess Greggie has all Aon staff too scared to post."
"This is a strong company that is stable and always growing. The dividend is low, but its a safe place to put money especially as new tax laws threaten inheritance, wealthy people will be flooding insurance companies to buy whole life insurance policies and other financial instruments to protect generational wealth. This stock will only continue to go up."
