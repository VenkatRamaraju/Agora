Why no required Nasdaq filings yet? What is it they are trying not to make public?
Next up $17
Looks like Shorts slowly being Margin called to cover losses. Big short squeeze coming
A significant increase in forecasted expectations today. This stock and company have come a long way in the past year.
I am really looking forward to some great earnings reports in the near future. I believe they are currently well undervalued.
a business completely dependent on low gas prices. hmmmmm
RV show in Tampa over the past weekend. Appears LAZY may have picked up some new investors. Hopefully a great earnings report can get this moving.
Omg! Another one! This is seriously big! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lazydays-rv-announces-airstream-dealership-133000545.html
"Where there is one roach thee are many... What's the real story behind this company? What's goin on? Why the late filing's. Action's like these, not always, but generally/usually precede some form of cooked books, that always ends up with a greatly reduced stock price. And, rightly so!"
"Market Cap of $176M, yet $63M in bank and almost $800M in revenues....just doesnt make sense, feels like I am missing something.....Rev and Earning increasing year over year by a sizeable chunk, I know this had a massive run last year its still feels like its digesting before moving higher....Woudl have thought todays news would have sent this over $19 for good"
Do we think this will go to $30 ?
"I live near Lazydays HQ location. Compared to CW, LAZY is like Target whereas CW is like Walmart."
"Hitting some resistance here at resistance level 1 @15.13, but it’s trying to break above it and test R2 at 17.42 on daily charts Weekly is a blue sky breakout still Be nice to see a flagpole develop at 15 to 13.50"
Nobody on this board? 6m float and great fundamentals... could go to the moon
Does anybody think gas prices will sink lazy’s sales
What a news past days! To the moon!
anyone else averaging down on this dip. have to believe it's up from here.
I am Jonnyboy. Buy another 100 shares thus week
So that’s why they were stalling the earnings report !!
Yuuge volume today. 122
ANDA about to double ? video at STOCKTRADEVIDEO (Google them)
Jonny ? You buying @ 8.80 ??
They had some interesting insights about LAZY on http://Bestplays.uno. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
tomorrow 20+
worth trying to trade the recent Hikkake? from inside day? looks like it tried breaking otu today but failed due to low volume. could be a sucker move to make shorts confident or it could be a false breakout....time will tell
Hope we can reach a level over $25 and keep it for over 20 days so the company can force the conversion of the 6MM Preferred Stock and we can get it over with. This stock deserves to trade much higher but its hold up by this overhang of shares. Suck it up and move on!!
"Still to undervalued at this point, market cap should be around the 400M at least, and that's without potential grow included. 400M market cap would mean a stock price of $ 42,50 more or lessGL to everyone"
I’m surprised at the lack of conversation in this one. RV sales seem to show no sign of slowing down. I’m bullish.
Read the comments on Yelp about there customer service.. we are in trouble here folks..
What time is earnings coming tommorow pre or post
"In 2023, investors will look forward by a year and assign a 7.5x multiple on this $8.60/share in EBITDA, for a value of $64.50, discounted back to today at 12% and LAZY should trade at $49 fair value."
Should have bought this in March. How much of a run could be left?
1st high volume down day! Showing some cracks at this level But today’s earnings show over 60m in cash on hand now !!!! And market cap is a little more than that . So company and sales and profits almost prices at nothing
And into the 5s we go..
To $20+ yeah!!!
I thought Earnings were being announced last Friday? Anybody??
Nice pop today
"If it goes down, just a buying opportunity. Holding for longer term."
I am ascribing a conservative two year price target of $40 based on multiple expansion to the 8x EV/EBITDA range and a price target of $60 if LAZY gets included in the Russell 2000.
Moving in a good direction
Insiders buying today though @ market.
"If you want value and growth, you've come to the right place)))"
"LAZY is above the cutoff for Russell 2000 index inclusion next month, with index reconstruction in June which is less than two months away."
"Q2 earnings per stock expected: 0,85.Q2 earnings per stock realisation: 2,43!"
they are a total buying spree
"my thoughts on this one - they are selling lots of RV's - BUT the secondary market will see sales of new units drop off in the coming years... research RV's a bit to see what I mean. There is also going to be lots of 'bad press' on RV's as to cheap-made because folks don't understand how to use them or that they are made to be light-weight. Add covid camping demands - lots of new units were rushed out in bad shape.I LOVE camping/glamping - we were 11 years in a pop-up and just got our ""new"" camper (a 2019 build - BEFORE covid bought on consignment)... But I am wary of this one - IF tey make all/most revenue from new sales..."
"This may be the beginning of a nice journey, much like Camping World."
LT LAZY
And into the 6s we go

Just heard that LAZY got alerted at (http://tradenow.xyz). I hope it pushes us higher!
If they could handshake with an electric vehicle company to build an electric powered unit.. I could very well guess this would double in the matter of a couple months.. hehe THE MAX
So what’s the deal with the warrants ? Are they worth the price at $3.55 ? I own the stock. Thinking of buying some warrants. When do they expire ? Imagine buying in back in June. Wish I knew. I’m a new investor here at $12 range looks really promising. Thanks for any info on the warrants good luck this week.
Hello 20's!!!
Earning per share now for last 12 months is .80 . So stock feels like value still here
"This is stupid cheap ! Good growth too.Only question is how do a gage RV demand, when i know nothing about RVs??"
Anyone buying on this pullback? Just added at 12.35.
"Withdrew the share offering, don’t see that every day. ""The proposed offering price did not reflect what we believe is the underlying value of the Company,"" stated William P. Murnane, Chairman and CEO of Lazydays. ""We have a very strong balance sheet and are willing to raise capital only if it is in the best interests of our shareholders."
I WALKED INTO LAZYDAYS TAMPA LOCATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 14 YEARS (WORKED THERE FOR 7 YEARS WHEN THE COMPANY WAS PROFITABLE) SERVICE AND PARTS DEPARTMENT LOOKED NEGLECTED. THEY HAD AT LEAST FORTY EMPTY SALES OFFICES. THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN RUN INTO THE GROUND AND MANAGEMENT HAS NO ANSWERS ON HOW TO TURN THINGS AROUND. THERE ONLY INTERESTED IN BUYING OUT OTHER DEALERSHIPS AND LINING THERE OWN POCKETS.
"I’d LAZY a buyout candidate at this low valuation? Sells at a significant discount to CWH. Would have to nearly triple to catch up to CWH price to sales. Based on LAZY size, it seems the growth trajectory could be very steep, with the new popularity of rv’s."
Up a little high after hours... Someone release earnings early?
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3606180-lazydays-reports-rise-in-july-preliminary-results?utm_campaign=twitter_automated&utm_content=news&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter_automated
Why the steep drop today?
"Volume completely dried up . Taking some profits here at 13.55Got in at 9.98 so taking the 35% , I’ll hold some to see if it can keep going but think we test 11 before hitting more new highs . Thinly traded so best to take some profits and not see them evaporate in a flash . That said still like the value here"
Day traders in & out daily ?
I see my $LAZY is on the move today.. should be more like $35 sitting around $20 for now.. hehe THE MAX
"How strange the chart fluctuation of LAZY is. The rises are fully deserved, this stock should have been trading around $ 20 + by now. But constantly after a deserved rise for good reason, the stock falls back to the start of the day in 30 minutes or sometimes lower. After which, in about a week time, the stock slowly climbs back to the level of the rapid and short rise before."
New high after hours ???
"Net income first quarter 15M. Now we are entering into the industry's busiest quarters...The Company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $79.5 million, up $16.0 million from December 31, 2020.Marketcap only 250M!!"
When I read news from LAZY again...
"Marketcap 235M. Net debt 24M (Lt debt 128M -./- cash 104M), EV = 259M.EBITA Q1 en Q2: 69M * 2 = 138M on yearly basis.EV / EBITDA = 1,87!"
