Hope we can reach a level over $25 and keep it for over 20 days so the company can force the conversion of the 6MM Preferred Stock and we can get it over with. This stock deserves to trade much higher but its hold up by this overhang of shares. Suck it up and move on!!
"Shares of Lazydays Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LAZY) moved higher by 4.5% from the previous closing price. Murnane William P filed a Form 4 with the SEC on Monday, November 23. The insider bought 2,500 shares at an average price of $13.25. After the transaction, the executive's stake in Lazydays Holdings Inc. moved to 205,999 shares."
Earning per share now for last 12 months is .80 . So stock feels like value still here
Should have bought this in March. How much of a run could be left?
"Net income first quarter 15M. Now we are entering into the industry's busiest quarters...The Company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $79.5 million, up $16.0 million from December 31, 2020.Marketcap only 250M!!"
They had some interesting insights about LAZY on http://Bestplays.uno. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I see my $LAZY is on the move today.. should be more like $35 sitting around $20 for now.. hehe THE MAX
a business completely dependent on low gas prices. hmmmmm
Nice pop today
"Withdrew the share offering, don’t see that every day. ""The proposed offering price did not reflect what we believe is the underlying value of the Company,"" stated William P. Murnane, Chairman and CEO of Lazydays. ""We have a very strong balance sheet and are willing to raise capital only if it is in the best interests of our shareholders."
"Q2 earnings per stock expected: 0,85.Q2 earnings per stock realisation: 2,43!"
And into the 6s we go
"I’d LAZY a buyout candidate at this low valuation? Sells at a significant discount to CWH. Would have to nearly triple to catch up to CWH price to sales. Based on LAZY size, it seems the growth trajectory could be very steep, with the new popularity of rv’s."
Just heard that LAZY got alerted at (http://tradenow.xyz). I hope it pushes us higher!
Next up $17
"I live near Lazydays HQ location. Compared to CW, LAZY is like Target whereas CW is like Walmart."
"In 2023, investors will look forward by a year and assign a 7.5x multiple on this $8.60/share in EBITDA, for a value of $64.50, discounted back to today at 12% and LAZY should trade at $49 fair value."
worth trying to trade the recent Hikkake? from inside day? looks like it tried breaking otu today but failed due to low volume. could be a sucker move to make shorts confident or it could be a false breakout....time will tell
Hello 20's!!!
Anyone buying on this pullback? Just added at 12.35.
"Volume completely dried up . Taking some profits here at 13.55Got in at 9.98 so taking the 35% , I’ll hold some to see if it can keep going but think we test 11 before hitting more new highs . Thinly traded so best to take some profits and not see them evaporate in a flash . That said still like the value here"
"Market Cap of $176M, yet $63M in bank and almost $800M in revenues....just doesnt make sense, feels like I am missing something.....Rev and Earning increasing year over year by a sizeable chunk, I know this had a massive run last year its still feels like its digesting before moving higher....Woudl have thought todays news would have sent this over $19 for good"
"Where there is one roach thee are many... What's the real story behind this company? What's goin on? Why the late filing's. Action's like these, not always, but generally/usually precede some form of cooked books, that always ends up with a greatly reduced stock price. And, rightly so!"
"If it goes down, just a buying opportunity. Holding for longer term."
Insiders buying today though @ market.
A significant increase in forecasted expectations today. This stock and company have come a long way in the past year.
"If you want value and growth, you've come to the right place)))"
I thought Earnings were being announced last Friday? Anybody??
Omg! Another one! This is seriously big! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lazydays-rv-announces-airstream-dealership-133000545.html
anyone else averaging down on this dip. have to believe it's up from here.
I WALKED INTO LAZYDAYS TAMPA LOCATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 14 YEARS (WORKED THERE FOR 7 YEARS WHEN THE COMPANY WAS PROFITABLE) SERVICE AND PARTS DEPARTMENT LOOKED NEGLECTED. THEY HAD AT LEAST FORTY EMPTY SALES OFFICES. THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN RUN INTO THE GROUND AND MANAGEMENT HAS NO ANSWERS ON HOW TO TURN THINGS AROUND. THERE ONLY INTERESTED IN BUYING OUT OTHER DEALERSHIPS AND LINING THERE OWN POCKETS.
"This is stupid cheap ! Good growth too.Only question is how do a gage RV demand, when i know nothing about RVs??"
THE MAX has bought here.. hehe
Why the steep drop today?
Do we think this will go to $30 ?
"my thoughts on this one - they are selling lots of RV's - BUT the secondary market will see sales of new units drop off in the coming years... research RV's a bit to see what I mean. There is also going to be lots of 'bad press' on RV's as to cheap-made because folks don't understand how to use them or that they are made to be light-weight. Add covid camping demands - lots of new units were rushed out in bad shape.I LOVE camping/glamping - we were 11 years in a pop-up and just got our ""new"" camper (a 2019 build - BEFORE covid bought on consignment)... But I am wary of this one - IF tey make all/most revenue from new sales..."
When I read news from LAZY again...
ANDA about to double ? video at STOCKTRADEVIDEO (Google them)
Moving in a good direction
I am ascribing a conservative two year price target of $40 based on multiple expansion to the 8x EV/EBITDA range and a price target of $60 if LAZY gets included in the Russell 2000.
And into the 5s we go..
I am really looking forward to some great earnings reports in the near future. I believe they are currently well undervalued.
"This may be the beginning of a nice journey, much like Camping World."
"Marketcap 235M. Net debt 24M (Lt debt 128M -./- cash 104M), EV = 259M.EBITA Q1 en Q2: 69M * 2 = 138M on yearly basis.EV / EBITDA = 1,87!"
"Hitting some resistance here at resistance level 1 @15.13, but it’s trying to break above it and test R2 at 17.42 on daily charts Weekly is a blue sky breakout still Be nice to see a flagpole develop at 15 to 13.50"
"From yesterday SEC: If any good news. On September 9, 2021, Lazydays Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) received notice that Wayzata Investment Partners LLC (“Wayzata”) intends to distribute its holdings of the Company’s common stock that is held in the funds it manages (the “Funds”) to the Funds’ general partners and limited partners on or about September 16, 2021. The Funds hold approximately 2,359,905 shares of common stock of the Company, and the Company understands Wayzata intends to distribute all of these shares. On September 13, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $25 million of the Company’s common stock through December 31, 2022. These shares may be purchased from time-to-time in the open market at prevailing prices, in privately negotiated transactions or through block trades."
New high after hours ???
What time is earnings coming tommorow pre or post
they are a total buying spree
"Congrats to all the LAZY peeps on your latest news of up coming increases.. I'll have ta some day soon get over to see youz guyz, as It's that time in my life, been thinking about downsizing.. less is more you know.. hehe THE MAX"
So that’s why they were stalling the earnings report !!
1st high volume down day! Showing some cracks at this level But today’s earnings show over 60m in cash on hand now !!!! And market cap is a little more than that . So company and sales and profits almost prices at nothing
Up a little high after hours... Someone release earnings early?
Read the comments on Yelp about there customer service.. we are in trouble here folks..
"I'm expecting over 50% gains to get to true value in these companies.. $NINE 57%, $UFAB 59%, $GNW 63%, and $LAZY 52%... this IFMK.. I'm looking for $1.05 to be at mid value but could go more.. That would be around 19% gain.. I'm all about value.. Gotta luv a Bargain.. hehe THE MAX"
Yuuge volume today. 122
So what’s the deal with the warrants ? Are they worth the price at $3.55 ? I own the stock. Thinking of buying some warrants. When do they expire ? Imagine buying in back in June. Wish I knew. I’m a new investor here at $12 range looks really promising. Thanks for any info on the warrants good luck this week.
"LAZY is above the cutoff for Russell 2000 index inclusion next month, with index reconstruction in June which is less than two months away."
"So, not to leave my compadres hangin.. I've since moved onto greener, less known value plays.. $SGMA, $AFI, $NINE, $UFAB, $GNW.. these others.. although still very valuable.. have a little less ratio than the first listings.. $LAZY, $HRTG, $NEXA, $IFMK, $BWEN, $AMPY, $DVAX, $JOB... IF YOUR LIKE ME.. you look for peeps who put up their short list and then do my own research on them.. If you don't do the R&D of your own list and loose money, it's yer own darn fault.. hehe THE MAX"
To $20+ yeah!!!
tomorrow 20+
Nobody on this board? 6m float and great fundamentals... could go to the moon
Why no required Nasdaq filings yet? What is it they are trying not to make public?
RV show in Tampa over the past weekend. Appears LAZY may have picked up some new investors. Hopefully a great earnings report can get this moving.
LT LAZY
I’m surprised at the lack of conversation in this one. RV sales seem to show no sign of slowing down. I’m bullish.
"Still to undervalued at this point, market cap should be around the 400M at least, and that's without potential grow included. 400M market cap would mean a stock price of $ 42,50 more or lessGL to everyone"

I am Jonnyboy. Buy another 100 shares thus week
"How strange the chart fluctuation of LAZY is. The rises are fully deserved, this stock should have been trading around $ 20 + by now. But constantly after a deserved rise for good reason, the stock falls back to the start of the day in 30 minutes or sometimes lower. After which, in about a week time, the stock slowly climbs back to the level of the rapid and short rise before."
Looks like Shorts slowly being Margin called to cover losses. Big short squeeze coming
Jonny ? You buying @ 8.80 ??
What a news past days! To the moon!
