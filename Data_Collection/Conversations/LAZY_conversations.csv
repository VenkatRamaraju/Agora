Conversation
I WALKED INTO LAZYDAYS TAMPA LOCATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 14 YEARS (WORKED THERE FOR 7 YEARS WHEN THE COMPANY WAS PROFITABLE) SERVICE AND PARTS DEPARTMENT LOOKED NEGLECTED. THEY HAD AT LEAST FORTY EMPTY SALES OFFICES. THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN RUN INTO THE GROUND AND MANAGEMENT HAS NO ANSWERS ON HOW TO TURN THINGS AROUND. THERE ONLY INTERESTED IN BUYING OUT OTHER DEALERSHIPS AND LINING THERE OWN POCKETS.
"I’d LAZY a buyout candidate at this low valuation? Sells at a significant discount to CWH. Would have to nearly triple to catch up to CWH price to sales. Based on LAZY size, it seems the growth trajectory could be very steep, with the new popularity of rv’s."
Insiders buying today though @ market.
"Q2 earnings per stock expected: 0,85.Q2 earnings per stock realisation: 2,43!"
When I read news from LAZY again...
"How strange the chart fluctuation of LAZY is. The rises are fully deserved, this stock should have been trading around $ 20 + by now. But constantly after a deserved rise for good reason, the stock falls back to the start of the day in 30 minutes or sometimes lower. After which, in about a week time, the stock slowly climbs back to the level of the rapid and short rise before."
"LAZY is above the cutoff for Russell 2000 index inclusion next month, with index reconstruction in June which is less than two months away."
RV show in Tampa over the past weekend. Appears LAZY may have picked up some new investors. Hopefully a great earnings report can get this moving.
I am ascribing a conservative two year price target of $40 based on multiple expansion to the 8x EV/EBITDA range and a price target of $60 if LAZY gets included in the Russell 2000.
And into the 5s we go..
Do we think this will go to $30 ?
Should have bought this in March. How much of a run could be left?
1st high volume down day! Showing some cracks at this level But today’s earnings show over 60m in cash on hand now !!!! And market cap is a little more than that . So company and sales and profits almost prices at nothing
"This may be the beginning of a nice journey, much like Camping World."
Does anybody think gas prices will sink lazy’s sales
So what’s the deal with the warrants ? Are they worth the price at $3.55 ? I own the stock. Thinking of buying some warrants. When do they expire ? Imagine buying in back in June. Wish I knew. I’m a new investor here at $12 range looks really promising. Thanks for any info on the warrants good luck this week.
"Still to undervalued at this point, market cap should be around the 400M at least, and that's without potential grow included. 400M market cap would mean a stock price of $ 42,50 more or lessGL to everyone"
Nobody on this board? 6m float and great fundamentals... could go to the moon
"Withdrew the share offering, don’t see that every day. ""The proposed offering price did not reflect what we believe is the underlying value of the Company,"" stated William P. Murnane, Chairman and CEO of Lazydays. ""We have a very strong balance sheet and are willing to raise capital only if it is in the best interests of our shareholders."
I’m surprised at the lack of conversation in this one. RV sales seem to show no sign of slowing down. I’m bullish.

"Where there is one roach thee are many... What's the real story behind this company? What's goin on? Why the late filing's. Action's like these, not always, but generally/usually precede some form of cooked books, that always ends up with a greatly reduced stock price. And, rightly so!"
Anyone buying on this pullback? Just added at 12.35.
they are a total buying spree
Jonny ? You buying @ 8.80 ??
"If you want value and growth, you've come to the right place)))"
"Market Cap of $176M, yet $63M in bank and almost $800M in revenues....just doesnt make sense, feels like I am missing something.....Rev and Earning increasing year over year by a sizeable chunk, I know this had a massive run last year its still feels like its digesting before moving higher....Woudl have thought todays news would have sent this over $19 for good"
"my thoughts on this one - they are selling lots of RV's - BUT the secondary market will see sales of new units drop off in the coming years... research RV's a bit to see what I mean. There is also going to be lots of 'bad press' on RV's as to cheap-made because folks don't understand how to use them or that they are made to be light-weight. Add covid camping demands - lots of new units were rushed out in bad shape.I LOVE camping/glamping - we were 11 years in a pop-up and just got our ""new"" camper (a 2019 build - BEFORE covid bought on consignment)... But I am wary of this one - IF tey make all/most revenue from new sales..."
a business completely dependent on low gas prices. hmmmmm
Why no required Nasdaq filings yet? What is it they are trying not to make public?
Nice pop today

"Hitting some resistance here at resistance level 1 @15.13, but it’s trying to break above it and test R2 at 17.42 on daily charts Weekly is a blue sky breakout still Be nice to see a flagpole develop at 15 to 13.50"
To $20+ yeah!!!
I see my $LAZY is on the move today.. should be more like $35 sitting around $20 for now.. hehe THE MAX
"Marketcap 235M. Net debt 24M (Lt debt 128M -./- cash 104M), EV = 259M.EBITA Q1 en Q2: 69M * 2 = 138M on yearly basis.EV / EBITDA = 1,87!"
If they could handshake with an electric vehicle company to build an electric powered unit.. I could very well guess this would double in the matter of a couple months.. hehe THE MAX
So that’s why they were stalling the earnings report !!
"If it goes down, just a buying opportunity. Holding for longer term."
Looks like Shorts slowly being Margin called to cover losses. Big short squeeze coming
