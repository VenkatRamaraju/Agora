Revenue and earnings beat! Up 4.4% AH. I didn't listen to the call yet - did they talk about Lyme and Crohn's milestones?
"Technical, daily spinning tops (indicate trend change);1. Had several mid-August, then up 30% in two weeks.2. Have the third in one week today, if close is about 32.5 today.Events ahead, ER Nov-03. Runup into Nov-03 would not surprise."
"This was supposed to have been the Tech Play of the Year, according to tech guru Jeff Brown."
Adaptive Biotechnologies is up 8.36% to 40.72
"ADPT capital raise is pathetic. Management sold all their shares 15 days back, and now they are doing capital raise. they should be fine as an insider trader. The market regulator should take action on ADPT management for cheating with investors. if they have not sold there shares it would have not been a problem"
"Cathy woods.isnt it gambling with these kind of stocks.viac,pfe,wmt,cvx they pay a dividend.how about seed for gambling,they only have a 3.7 million share float.and will be feeding china and india"
"It’s up today because the Canaccord analyst for Illumina thinks ADPT is a potential buyout candidate. It certainly is at this price! Regardless , it makes no sense to sell the company, which is banking on a singular blood test that can eventually find every pathogen known. The science is for real but the trillions of sequences necessary to find signals takes a lot of time. Five or six years from now, when an intermediate test is out giving the company earnings, the discussion will change to how many $billions of revenue will come when 300 million people get their yearly Adaptive blood test by 2030-2035? By then, the stock is over $200 a share going to the moon.FWIW, a buyout would never occur since Chad and Harlan have enough money and have no need to sell. If it did, there is no way it happens under $120 today.A lot of people don’t realize how difficult it is to value spectacular companies years away from having a reliable income stream. One of many metrics is what the company is worth if bought out. Another is its extreme value price, which would occur if someone comes out with a better technology (highly unlikely in this case). We probably hit the low for the decade."
"Adaptive has filed comments in the FDA Docket for the FDA Advisory Committee which will discuss Covid19 vaccines Oct 22, indicating the need for understanding of vaccine serology and T cell responses to vaccines."
"ADPT is no start-up. It's had a name change and been out there floating around for for 5 years. Still, there are big names putting big money into this outfit. There will no doubt be many people holding their cards here because of that, after many have already folded."

"cnbc said in the history of ipo's it's beyond meat and this stock, that have shot up and doubled in value. Microsoft backing, and excellent tech for genetical level dna med treatment. Im not selling. Im holding, everybody is holding. So price is beyond meat level. Beyond meat stock. Basically this is a beyond meat stock, but worth trillion times more."
we will be at 50 in 30days or less mark my words
In a few years if a company does not want to run a clinical trial with Adaptive technology the 'FDA will want to know why. The pace of adoption is about explode as Abbvie recognizes how valuable Adaptive technologies is. Calendar 2020 folks will be very impressive as real world data starts rolling in.
Down 6% and not 1 post?
Any thoughts on the where the bottom is for ADPT?
any dip in share price of ADPT is a buying opportunity...
Bought $38.00
What does this company do again?
Sec Form 4s: early March around 1 million shares divested by insiders. Looks like it was an 18 month lockup.
"Nice- anybody wants to check it out: The thread is very heartening if you have a position in ADPT:Simon Barnett@sbarnettARKOnce Adaptive Biotech launches T-Detect Lyme, and inexorably more autoimmune indications, it may be the only molecular diagnostic company that can add new ‘products’ solely through over-the-air (OTA) software updates.7:35 PM · Aug 19, 2021·Twitter for iPhone"
"So today this stock had very low volume, dropped 3 percent, fluctuated all day with very low volume then popped 10 percent in literally 30 minutes."
"Insiders sold almost 100,000 shares in June @ $40 or less. If YOU thought the stock was going to mid 50's or 60 in a few months, would YOU sell? How many people on this board have bought shares this year? Insiders bought ZERO... Someone should tell these mental giants what SMART investors really do."
According to their balance sheet.. total assets 789 millions. Total liabilities 538 millions. Those who talk about bankruptcy are stupid ..probably short sellers.
Received this Sat Oct-02 from the company: highlights of PDF cover Lyme and COVID reported this weekend.If I was a patient or doctor I'd want to know that a natural infection can be distinguished from a vaccine responseReal-world data show T-Detect COVID can detect prior SARS-CoV-2 infection nearly 12 months after initial diagnosis in some patientsNew research demonstrates T-cell testing using T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire characterization can distinguish natural SARS-CoV-2 infection from COVID-19 vaccine responseLate-breaking data show TCR repertoire characterization is nearly two times more sensitive than the standard two-tiered testing (STTT) at identifying Lyme disease
45-47 today...will support at 55plus
100 % specificity is unprecedented “This is just the beginning “ from the release is an understatement. T cells are the future. Well done Adaptive and Microsoft. Would love to see MSFT acquire ADPT so they can focus on their mission and not worry about investors.
what dose the article published today about ADPT concerning hedge funds mean.It mentions ADPT is good buy now but dont hedge funds short stocks.

I am afraid the SEC left the seeing eye dog in the locker...

"Disappointing: Use of T-Detect for research rather than to clinics (In addition, Adaptive recently inked an agreement with Moderna to use its ImmunoSeq T-Map COVID technology to measure the T-cell response to Moderna's second-generation COVID vaccine and Zika vaccine).

"10% dilution, no proceeds to the company. Sale by certain shareholders. I've seen this before in other companies I've owned, namely TTD. The share price was not hurt by that. Management said the sellers were early backers, before IPO."
$100 stock by the year ended?
Yesterday's 16% decline really should be investigated....but unfortunately the SEC left the seeing eye  in the locker.
There is buying by big pockets below 30.

"T-Detect anybody!This is so crazy- because antibody levels drop after 8 months we need a booster - makes no sense. Antibody levels drop after vaccination or infection as time passes. Basing decisions on serology in 2021 is just not right. Look for specific T cell responses. Delta Variant or any other variant needs to rejig the vacciine but looking at T cell epitopes will help us. ADPT needs to TALK. Rod Wong, MD@docrodwong·Jul 288 months post 2nd-dose, pfizer phase 1 antibody levels have dropped by over 75%. that doesn't mean protection drops to that degree because we don't have good ways of measuring immune memory. that said, good news a booster dose takes antibody levels ~4x higher than peak."
good earnings (forecast)!

"After doing some research on Adaptive I finally came to the conclusion: this could be THE NEXT BIG THING! Their tech on gene sequencing is absolutely revolutionary and indispensable, especially in the treatment of cancer, in the years to come. Benefits for patients and the healthcare industry will be so big that it is really difficult to put an adequate price tag on this right now. If it drops to or below 25$ I will accumulate as wisely as I can! But I don't think that lock-up ending will necessarily put too much pressure on the stock, as it has already sold off heavily. Come 2020 and beyond I mark this stock as a winner!"
Shouldn’t the Illumina partnership be seen as a positive??

"Yesterday we got preprint of from SciLifeLab (Science for Life Laboratory) in Sweden (Uppsala): It was long read sequencing (using PACB) vs short reading sequencing in single cells. The cells selected were T cells, the cells which ADPT looks at. Results show that LRS reads were superior and they detected more than SRS could do. ADPT uses TXG for single cell genomics- to look at gene rearrangements in TCR (T Cell receptor)- this is how T cells induce adaptive T cell responses. So the tools for studying TCR gene rearrangements have gotten better. Good for T Cell Biology - here for ADPT."

"Flow cytometry studies are used to identify and quantify the cells of the IMMUNE SYSTEM and to characterize hematological malignancies. I remember from the conference call at Cowen there was discussion of ClonoSeq vs 'flow', with the statement of ADPT CEO that ClonoSeq is much faster and more accurate. I also heard on NPR about Flow Cytometry use at this time for diagnosis of Coronavirus."

The importance of the news is its 97% detection and 100 % specificity That’s amazing!It’s late to the game and I doubt is a big revenue enhancer but it’s a confirmation of the focus on T cells as the Holy Grail of diagnostics. Think long term.

"Their ability to sequence and characterize the state of the immune system is absolutely amazing. It should be mentioned that they did have a competitor called Sequenta. However, Adaptive bought them out a few years ago to become the only one left in this area with extensive patent protection. They essentially have a monopoly in immune system sequencing. Every human disease state involves the immune system. I think their technology will become the standard of care around the world in the near future."

Adaptive received $300 million in an initial upfront payment in February and is eligible to receive around $1.8 billion in additional payments upon reaching certain milestones. Under the terms of the deal, Genentech will also pay Adaptive royalties on any sales of products commercialized under the agreement."
"Got a hunch about this company, hyper bullish. Don't want to jinx it with a prediction."
Is it correct to assume that Adaptives great rebound from the corona low can be attributed in large parts to Bill Gates talking about the virus age in his TED talk appearance a few years ago (incredible how he foresaw the events of now!) and MSFT now taking action on the matter in conjunction with ADPT?
"With the groundbreaking technology this company possesses and the partnerships they have established with the likes of Microsoft, Amgen, and Genentech to name a few..... the possible return on investment to those buying shares at these levels in the next 3-5 years is mind boggling."

Adaptive Biotechnologies is down 7.54% to 58.44
I'm going to love waking up to a buyout one morning soon....No way another healthcare company doesn't pull the trigger on this gym sitting at an INSANE valuation at this point in time. Asset RICH but CASH poor has created this unique situation...ADPT will make for a VERY tempting takeover target
what's going on ah?
ADPT is the best losing stock in my portfolio (thank you Jeff brown and Whitney Tilson).All of the ADPT losses in 2021 will mitigate my gains this year.
10% in three days not bad
ADPT is a monopoly in T and B cells immune sequencing area. And the field entry is extremely high. It is the dominant player in this field for a long time if there is ever a competitor. It does not like any other biotech companies.

"1. Thin float (eg. Viking owns over 30% probably bought at $10)).2. Success or failure will be several years from now.3. At least seven other firms chasing same goal with Grail (ILMN spin-off) in big lead with thousands of people tested and FDA breakthrough designation.4. Over $50, the market cap is pretty crazy at nearly $7 billion (about equal to GH’s that is also ahead of them).5. Maybe a big payoff for a few of these companies, but way too early to be ‘betting the ranch!’"
"RV, I see no studies for 'Vaccibody' AND 'Sars-CoV2' infection at Clinicaltrials.gov."
nice pop this morning. anybody here have any news?
"I've now listened to the Goldman Sac's interview with Adaptive's Chad Robbins half a dozen times. I guess the reason I find the talk so interesting is that it provides a complete explanation of how the company should be able to transform medicine all the way through infectious disease (including viral and Lyme), up through immune (Crohn's, celiac, colitis), and finally through cancer with accurate diagnosis, efficient therapies, including greatly reduced cost for the patient, clinics and payers. This is a little difficult to appreciate for two reasons, but it's finally starting to sink in."
"the way it danced under 39 was extremely frustrating....then it broke through like a champ, 40-45 by today or tomorrow"
In at 39 yesterday and out at 47 today. I'm happy. Probably will get the opportunity to buy back lower.
"Be greedy when everyone is afraid and be afraid when everyone is greedy. Today is a good day to purchase ADPT. It also might already seen the bottom. Once this stock turns around, it will be back to $50"
"What does everyone think about the long-term (5 to 10 years) prospects for ADPT's valuation. I do not see any effective competition for ADPT. Given that the market opportunity is $50 billion and a conservative valuation of 5X sales, this would result in market cap of $250 billion, which is 50X times the current share price. This would result in $2,000 per share. This assumes that they are able to continue to execute flawlessly. What does everyone think? I am thinking of plunking down more money for a decade or more. I can definitely see their technology impacting almost every known disease since the immune system is involved in everything health related."

"New to board, but invested on recommendation of a guy named Jeff Brown vouched for by a Whitney tilson. Advice was to buy as long as price was below $50. This effing stock has been in the 30’s for the 3 weeks since I bought. I won’t lose money but cashing out next week. If you get advice from brown or tilson, BUYER BEWARE."
"Big ABC down since late June. With all these variants, more money will connect the dots. Morgan Stanley has."
What is happening that could explain this 6.4 % down ?
"This stock under 50$ again? You gotta be kiddin'! This will see 200$ still this decade, not too bad an investment at this point I'd say..."
Anyone buying? Huge open wow!
Adaptive Biotechnologies reached an all time high at 58.00
Important to remember ClonoSeq MRD is used in most blood cancer trials as The Primary Outcome Measure
I can't believe that analysis from Jeffries didn't see this. A target price of $77 back in Q2! An average shmoe like me noticed this. Now his target price is $13. Go out on a limb why don't cha? This system is still rigged. Stocks are still not for the common investor.

"I recommend the Cowen Interview with the ADPT CEO. It's available at the ADPT website under the events tab. I don't understand all of it yet, but it is clear the company's tech is unique and will grow at a high rate. Several indications are or will be in the approval stage this year, Minimal Residual Disease will be the way clinics quantify the number of cancer cells in heme cancers. The database of antigens will become the basis of accurate cancer diagnosis. All other disease categories are applicable to the technology, including infectious, neurological and more. They covered a lot of ground in only 31 minutes."

this will go back to 50$ in no time
T-Detect is a sensitive and accurate method to establish history of immune response to COVID. Our immune systems much better at recording infection status than anti-body tests.
"Correction; Deferred revenue on the cash flow statement is $276 million, no $232 million, so there's an extra 44 million for the next periods."
"ADPT needs to market T- Detect NOW!Best story about COVID 19 variants and Vaccine- written by a very good journalist in NY Times The studies may soothe fears that immunity to the virus is transient, as is the case with coronaviruses that cause common colds.CREDITCHRISTOPHER CAPOZZIELLO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMESImmunity to the Coronavirus May Persist for Years, Scientists FindImportant immune cells survive in the bone marrow of people who were infected with the virus or were inoculated against it, new research suggests.15h agoBy APOORVA MANDAVILLIBut no mention of T detect! Why- because 99% of MDs and most of ID Specialists do not know or have heard about use of T cell epitopes. Time for ADPT to reach out with megaphones to educate them."
"Simon Barnett@sbarnettARKReplying to @wolfejoshYes, also ending the diagnostic odyssey for Lyme, and potentially dozens of autoimmune diseases with a simple, one-and-done blood test. https://investors.adaptivebiotech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adaptive-biotechnologies-launches-national-clinical-trial…Current tests are highly inaccurate, resulting in lengthy diagnostic journey An oral medication being developed by a California biopharmaceutical company is in phase-one trials in people.

Valneva signed a deal with Pfizer last year to commercialize what it’s calling VLA15."
50$ let's gooooo
Trying to learn about this and confused as to what does this test really add. Open to knowledgeable answers and discussion(instead of dislikes). Looks like if this test can’t differentiate between current and past infections then this is not the test you want to get if you have covid like symptoms.
This company looks like a perfect T/O candidate
"You can have all the science- and you get lucky because you can show your science- but use for society and as business strategy lies in commercialization & execution. FDA approved this medication nearly 3 months back: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the T-Detect COVID Test developed by Adaptive Biotechnologies.Mar 5, 2021"
ARK will add more.
I have 44k worth of this stock in my brokerage account. how do I get my money back?
