Received this Sat Oct-02 from the company: highlights of PDF cover Lyme and COVID reported this weekend.If I was a patient or doctor I'd want to know that a natural infection can be distinguished from a vaccine responseReal-world data show T-Detect COVID can detect prior SARS-CoV-2 infection nearly 12 months after initial diagnosis in some patientsNew research demonstrates T-cell testing using T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire characterization can distinguish natural SARS-CoV-2 infection from COVID-19 vaccine responseLate-breaking data show TCR repertoire characterization is nearly two times more sensitive than the standard two-tiered testing (STTT) at identifying Lyme disease
