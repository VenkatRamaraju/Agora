"I get email, it will be called"
I am new to this ponze scheme. Before Oct 2018 rgey paid a divy of .45. Had a 1:3 split and still continued to pay a divy of .45 Who let them get by with that. Fust sayn
AINV is down 11.08% to 5.37
AINV is up 9.52% to 6.56
how high can this go this year. Making higher highs is a good sign IMO
Apollo Investment is up 7.04% to 11.56
Nice part about fiscal report is NAV went from $15.70 to $15.88 and a special dividend of .05 was declared along with a .31 regular quarterly dividend.
"I own AINV for many years the buy back, and the 1for 3 reverse split is a concern ,book value or NAV may be high now to market value but management is trying cover up problems with some of their holdings which will cause future NAV lower that is my feeling mangament does not buy enough itself on the open market and they should be paying a monthly dividend just like PSEC and MAIN"
AINV monthy dividend is needed for this go nowhere fund/BDC
Apollo Investment is up 5.22% to 8.67
AINV is down 6.63% to 9.44
I have held this stock for a lot of years including the reverse split. My cost average is around $17.00 plus dollars and I like the dividend and the little extra that it pays. I am reinvesting the dividends now to bring my cost averaging down this is working for me. This is a good investment so hang in there for future growth.
Come on Apollo let rocky win
AINV is down 10.81% to 6.02
Never heard of this company until reading that they would be buying for the rights of dying media businesses Yahoo and AOL. Its also interesting to know that this company has strong ties to Jeffrey Epstein. .. so its probably a good business for the wealthy and shady investors.
Just bought inAdded this to my BDV portfolio Nice dividend
The NAV for AINV is fake this close end fund is a fraud MAIN is the only one that pays monthly and holds its value in the last 3 years better than PSEC ARCC and AINV
AINV is down 10.99% to 9.96
AINV is up 9.02% to 5.92
Thinking of selling.
Can't continue to pay out at this rate...
This is a $15 stock come June 2021. Plus a great dividend. Can't miss on this stock. With huge deficit spending by Federal Government and huge National Debt...rates have to go up in 2021.....and that will propel this stock higher.
I firmly believe this is a junk stock. Much better buys in the market and better yield plays than this dog...

So AINV beats estimates by almost 30% yesterday and citigroup downgrades it to sell today? Uhhhhh.....what? Someone please explain to me the reasoning behind this because I don't get it.
Why has NII been declining so much?
"What just happened this past Friday as the stock drop.50 and today again down .46? The company also reported a positive earnings and gave a dividend of.31 with a special extra dividend of.05, that should have given a increase value of this stock."
what's with today's weakness?
Down to 5.56 today. A 35% drop today. Anyone know why?
"Barclays just raised AINV to $18 following the reverse split. The split is nothing but an accounting trick, but in this case is a good thing for shareholders. AINV's stock price now allows institutions to buy in: many institutions are not allowed to purchase stock below $10/share. This action by the company removes that limit. The buyback is a cherry on the cake. They're finally moving in the right direction."
I'm liking this dividend
They are spending less and less on information. The smarter people have left as all the relevant information. This has turned in to a POS!
I just got my dividend of .31 and another .05 dividend that was a surprise and how come?

"This company like mule perform lousy in both good times and bad times. I never understood why. It has best management in the industry, yet disappointing performance most of the times.Go figure!!"
"""most often after the company splits with a newer higher price... eventually it goes back down to the original price before the split"" --- I agree with this on condition that the management is the same."
Hit a low on 12/26/18 and has been going up since then. Not a barn burner by any stretch but definitely nice to see a (possible) upward trend developing.
Quiet board - anyone still holding this
"Debt to equity, at 1.75, is quite high. When NAV declines in the second quarter they will be up against the debt cap. The covenant requires that are attached to secure debt may become and issue, driving the sale of assets such as the stocks they just bought back."
Ex Dividend day
What happened this morning?
"Bought lots of AINV around 14.8 Yesterday based on:45 cents div is coming soon. Ex date is 12/19, need to own it at 12/18.at 22% discount to book valueCompany announce buyback not long agoGood Luck to long!"
$50 million more buy-back fire power added. Earnings looked pretty good too. This ship appears to be on the right course.
Needs to break $9....then smooth sailing to $10.50
Good pre-market movement
AINV is down 4.95% to 12.85
It’s up 4.5%?
Better than a stick in the eye.

"Repurchased 1,286,565 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $11.62, inclusive of commissions, for an aggregate cost of $15.0 million during the quarter"
Why is this up so much
"It sounds like they have finally turned the corner and doing better with the new top leaders of AINV. They have a buy back policy and seem to be doing better with the bottom line. I have held this stock for a lot of years and am still below what my cost bottom line is , but I like the dividends they are paying."
Apollo Investment is down 4.92% to 13.90
"CITI strikes again! Lowlifes. They downgrade other companies when they themselves were on the brink in the late 2000's. Oh well, I will buy more shares. They downgrade another of my stocks not too long ago. It dropped like a rock but has recovered to a higher price."
anyone tell me why this stock has dropped so much today
AINV is up 6.04% to 8.25
I'm in this for the dividend… But it would be nice if it could at least exhibit a little bit of growth in the next year and maintain levels like $15 to 20 A share￼
So the dividend was just slashed by two thirds............. 20cents

Midish $13 a share makes this a definite buy. Has a NAV of $15.88 with a yield near 9pct.
Is Apollo (parent company) or AINV buying Aspen?
Average down?
Looks like the uptrend has been established. I just hope the momentum sticks. Will be interesting when they announce earnings.

They also have a higher return than NLY which has been higher for a LONG time. So the BDCs are finally outperforming the REITs though I believe both have a legitimate place in any decent portfolio. I think AINV has done a great job in derisking their portfolio of holdings even though the analysts aren't necessarily fans. I prefer it over the highly hyped BX which is near its 52 week highs and is overvalued at this point with only half of the yield of AINV.
