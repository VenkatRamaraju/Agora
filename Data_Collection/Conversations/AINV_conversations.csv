AINV reached a 52 Week low at $14.30
well. not good. they fell of the COVID cliff and not coming back. Is this the same Apollo who took Rackspace Inc. private a while back and RXT got IPO'd yesterday?
Just dumped mine. That 9.30 at 4:04 was me. tired of them constantly cutting the dividend. Maybe i'll come back in after it goes under 8.

How about that reverse stock split they did a few years ago......is another coming?

"This is huge,On March 12th, 2020 Apollo Global Management Announces New $500 Million Share Repurchase AuthorizationApollo Global Management, Inc.

Doesn’t look like Wall Street likes the buyout news of aspen
Apollo Investment is up 13.35% to 10.36
AINV is down 7.14% to 8.43
"Barclays just raised AINV to $18 following the reverse split. The split is nothing but an accounting trick, but in this case is a good thing for shareholders. AINV's stock price now allows institutions to buy in: many institutions are not allowed to purchase stock below $10/share. This action by the company removes that limit. The buyback is a cherry on the cake. They're finally moving in the right direction."
This is a $15 stock come June 2021. Plus a great dividend. Can't miss on this stock. With huge deficit spending by Federal Government and huge National Debt...rates have to go up in 2021.....and that will propel this stock higher.

any estimates at price after Nov 5th earnings? I'm worried it's heading to $5. I'll be interested to hear their explanation.

"Why does it show N/A for Dividends? They do pay one, don't they? EPS?"
AINV is down 6.63% to 9.44
They also have a higher return than NLY which has been higher for a LONG time. So the BDCs are finally outperforming the REITs though I believe both have a legitimate place in any decent portfolio. I think AINV has done a great job in derisking their portfolio of holdings even though the analysts aren't necessarily fans. I prefer it over the highly hyped BX which is near its 52 week highs and is overvalued at this point with only half of the yield of AINV.
a leveraged bet on a bunch of craps...
does this stock send out a k1 at tax time?
Why dropping today?
kkr and carlye better
