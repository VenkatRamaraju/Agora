"Good Volume in Slb overall recently , MM appear to be Slowly accumulating shares with up tick in volume a price, BUT very soon i think a big jump in volume is coming into Oil Stocks especially SLB , i also think theres a Whale or Two out there considering going in Large on Oil and SLB, if so, it should be very soon, no Whale thinking of coming into SLB, is going to sit by and watch SLB run up to 40 before he BUYS in, we all know when and if SLB does take off it, will blow thru 45-50 in price, if oil hits 90-100, so timing is everything, and Whale or no Whale, INVESTORS thinking of coming into Oil Sector and SLB, will start coming in Thru 4th quarter and into 2022, so BUY BUY BUY, lock in on dividend, Barclays liking Slb to 50 range....opinion only g luck folks"
"see you guys down the road Sold out 20k shares at 34. Made 100k+ Why sell? Because of div increase which translates to ""we are very uncertain about the future"" I too had once thought SLB would go to 40, and they probably will someday, but not until much further down the road. 2022 earning est. to be @$2,00. 2Ã— 20 multiple is $40. Without a divy this stock trades between 25 and 35 for the foreseeable future. goodbye and good luck to one and all."
SLB fair value is $55. These prices are a steal. 2022 SLB will gain 50%.
"I told you back in May to sell at $34, then I told you to buy aggressively at $26 a couple of months ago. I am neutral on SLB at $34 again, but keep in mind - we are in a bull market for oil stocks for at least 2 more years so use any dip and selloff as an opportunity to accumulate more. Most oil stocks are still at half or less of where they traded during the last bull market for oil so there is plenty of room for price appreciation. To recap - long term bullish on SLB, short term neutral."
"Dam cramer! He called a top in oil on his show Tuesday referencing the ""larry williams"" charts. We'll see."
"The argument for neutral inshort term is it's hard to be bullish oil prices due to supply issues and also bullish oil services. Hard to say where the upper range will sit, but feels like we are almost there considering the underperformance vs. sector. However, itt may be one of the best LT sector investments and is popular among the normie PM looking to add oil exposure"
"MarketEdge Second opinion upgrades SLB, FTI to strong buy"
"ANyone knows if SLB earning report will be pre market, or post market on the 22nd?Thanks"
Oil is not going away and service of equipment and rigs has been put off for 4 years with cheap oil prices the time comes when you got to drill new and repair what you have. SLB is a good bet
"fyi......BUY BUY BUY before blowout earnings, get SLB under 35 while you can, after blowout earnings, this WHALE of a stock is going to pop up FAST to the 37-40 plus range, i wouldnt want to be short slb into earnings this week, HAMMER TIME, opinion olly g luck"
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while SLB barley does anything at all."
"It's two steps forward, one step back. Don't hate on me but it could pull back to around $30, at which point I will buy more."
"""Income 39 cents a share (adjusted earnings per share more than doubled to 36 cents from 16 cents, compared with the FactSet consensus of 36 cents). Revenue grew 11.2% to $5.85 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $5.15 billion."" This is an earnings beat, or meet on adjusted. The numbers also show a revenue beat. That means 2 for 2...this is a buy."
Tomorrow there should be a good report with super profit - most likely they will return the dividends!
"Listened to the conference call. Business sounds great for at least a couple of years. I like owning energy stocks as they are so out of favor and serve as insurance in my portfolio. What I do struggle with is that in an increasingly ESG driven world, many portfolio managers will be unwilling to own these stocks. As they sell, energy weights in the indexes drop, so passive buyers have no incentive to buy. Seems like a vicious circle. Anyways, good luck to all."
Target $47 by Morningstar Equity Research! Wish they make the right bet.
Barclays adjusted SLB price target this morning from 38 to 48. You'll see it in your brokerage news feed
Earning up & forward guidance is strong so why is it down on PM??
"Exceptional multi-year oil &gas industry capital spend expected going forward, by necessity. That's my takeaway from the call. Half a billion debt reduction from FCF. Couldn't ask for better buy signals and large big potential returns next year. $40 isn't too far away imo."
Oil is still over $80/per share!
