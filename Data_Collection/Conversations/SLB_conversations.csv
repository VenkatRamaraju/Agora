Huge upside in the making. July could be volatile so don't panic. Demand will exceed supply since capex within the industry is stagnant (meaning less invested in infrastructure to produce more) while the world reopens(increase demand). Delta variant seen as a headwind for now but I look at it more from a macro noise standpoint than an actual threat. It will have some impact which should also keep OPEC from supplying more than whats currently needed. OIH which is a proxy for the services industry has never traded below $400-$600 when oil prices are at $75. Therefore we have a lot of catching up to do and we should get there when the big guys recognize the FCF monsters these companies have become. Long. Patience. GL.
This is the best of breed in oil services and will be a survivor and I for years looked at it and did not want to pay the price it sat. God Bless and stay well.
Waiting for that massive short covering to begin in OIH. Strong rally ahead. Delayed due to covid headwinds.
(http://financialdeals.tech) has been the best thing that’s happened to my portfolio! The stock picks are top-notch and well researched. I highly recommend them for any trader out there!
"Don't buy apple, facebook or Tesla. Traders took huge profit on those overpriced stocks and sold oil stocks like SLB to offset the profit. This will come back."
Is there a reason the dividend hasn't been restored yet? Is there rather a repurchase under way?
Well if the company can't put dividend yield over 2% maybe the market will!!
"did anyone receive their April 12, dividend yet? I am on ETRADE and they said they have not yet received the dividend from SLB yet."
"I'm long SLB as well. I've got hopes for the Schlum, closing last week out (7/16/21) at 27.87. They seem to be forward thinking, and spending money on R&D. They paid too much for Cameron probably, and CEO transition probably hurt, as did COVID. Might need a couple more years to show their value but I think the R&D gives them a leg up. This feels like a good entry price. Also excited to see what their New Energy division does, and promising to see them working with the likes of Pansonic Energy on the lithium front.Looking at 2yr insider transactions is a little disappointing. Would appreciate if the executives showed their belief in the company, but probably not going to see much of that these days in this industry."
$0.22 EPS vs street expected $0.17. Nice jobs.
I'm not a shareholder but the dividend seems to be sustainable given this huge free cash flow...
"A Problem Developingfor people with an EV car during a power outage. If you don't have a second car that is gas powered you could be without transportation. Until our power grid is updated with the new demand for power, we can expect more power outages."
Congratulations SLB nice results nice cashflow!
"I told you not long ago to ignore the pumpers and sell at $34. Now I bought some more SLB at $26.6 in pre-market - telling you to do the same . We have a capitulation here. Oil stocks are oversold. The fundamentals both for oil and oil stocks remain strong. That's a great opportunity for a potential 50%+ return over the next 12 months on a solid company like SLB. Some other stocks will double from current levels, if only oil remains above $60."
"Oil up $1.1 and is back at multi-year highs above $75 - oil stocks are... down. God forbids tomorrow oil will pull back by $0.20 and you will see a massive selloff, if judging from recent price action."
What an EXCELLENT earnings report! Beat both EPS and Revenue GREATLY. PLUS Dividend and GENERATE FREE CASH FLOW OF MORE THAN HALF BILLION $. It will go much Higher than 26.
"I was expecting a big down in SLB today, but it is showing strength atleast as of my writing. when oil is bleeding more than 10%, slb is down less than 5%, I call this strength.i don't know if it makes sense to anyone else.."
"Higher oil prices = higher gas prices = more oil companies drilling for profitable oil= more demand for services that SLB offers, even as their business model expands to alternatives."
Hard to believe that this once grand company with all its technology trades at a valuation equivalent to a tech start up in silicon valley that makes apps for phones.Management sure has saddled this with a whole lot of debt ...which looks to be coming to the forefront with Moody's review. Hope they can shed costs enough to save the equity here.
"No bear market, just hedges selling at opportunity when Powell gets on tv. oil draw in us is 7.5 mill barrels. I expect a good run next week"
"My it is so quite here. ""The Schlumberger of tomorrow will not be the Schlumberger of today,"" Le Peuch said in pledging that improved returns would take priority over revenue growth. The reason I love this company is because there is so much to work with. A great company, pays well and stellar benefits. So in a depressed industry, why are we not moving people around the company in areas that are needed, from areas losing money. Why are we paying for ((1))single hour of overtime? This is the root cause of a digital/ A I future. Failure to manage cost. So very much to do..."
Cowen raises SLB TP to $32. Wish they are right. It sounds good for long term investment.
Push down!
My biggest investment disaster in the last 3 years. I’m stuck with $50 average. I never thought things thing will drop so much
SLB should be $30–$40 we are so undervalue
"This went out on Reuters today. Schlumberger expects to ''materially grow'' margins and cash flow in near to medium term - CEOBY Reuters— 9:38 AM ET 09/08/2021DENVER, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Schlumberger NV, the world's leading oilfield service provider, expects to materially grow its margins and cashflow over the medium and short term horizons, Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said on Wednesday.The company expects to reach adjusted EBIDTA margins of 25%, or a 500 basis point expansion from pre-pandemic levels, over that period. It expects to continue generating double-digit free cash flow margins and restore return on capital employed to double digits in the short to medium term, Le Peuch said.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Denver)"
I'm buying more. There is no reason for this strong downturn
One of those who bought and now holding forever.. What are you all's buy /average price ? Mine is 54.
"Folks, i recently posted, Slb was at 36 plus weeks ago, its going back to 33 soon, and should tier up to 36-38 , opinion only, g luck"
People are selling like oil just hit $30 / barrel...
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014. The average pump price Thursday was $3.14 a gallon, according to auto club AAA. 2021 Bloomberg L.P.$CLR $RIG $OXY $COP $VLO $HFC $NOV $HP $RES $MUR $XOM $CVX $BP $KMI $MRO $DVN $PXD $HAL $BKR $SLB $MPC"
I would think that if the oil companies are not using them to drill additional wells they would be making their existing wells more efficient.
Buckle up
I finally bought into SLB today. Did I make right decision?
What was the market expecting? Profits?! How is this report received so badly? The loss was very small when taking account the state of this industry
I think we are witnessing a turn in sentiment in oil stocks. In the past 3 months a rally in oil prices barely budged oil stocks whereas a small pullback caused a selloff. Now it's going to be the opposite: a pullback in oil prices causes a minor pullback in oil stocks whereas a small up move in oil prices will cause oil stocks to rally. The market is saying: enough is enough. The outlook for the oil sector is still positive with continuous improvements in business fundamentals.
Don’t invest in 19th Century energy stocks. No future as oil obsolete in a few years
Load up at this price before earnings it’s going back over 30 next few daysG luck
Lower divi for a year allows them to pay down debt. Maybe 12 more months of pennies dividend but stronger balance sheet
Not sure if anyone else read the actual report. It is great to see the tech company approach SLB is taking. They entered the tech industry with class. Energy also needs tech giants! Very smart and relieving to see SLB chop its goodwill down by 20% last year. Good year: way to go! I like the light asset approach.
Big boys keeping prices down while they load up.
Aramco spending more on production. Go $LB...
If the company is so organized and remarks suggest the $60.00 range why when the market has risen and gas and oil stocks have had a nice run is SLB sitting stagnant? It's extremely frustrating. The stock should be at $37.00 imo by now. Ugh.
"the underrated company, the best service oil company in the S&P500."
"Jefferson may be a disgruntled long. Can you really blame him? We have have positive earnings for years and although we are in the greatest bull market in the history of bull markets, the price has continued to decline."
I buy all I can below 27. there's been strong support at 26/27 all year long.
"Good earnings, dividend is safe oil up. Slb will rise but need to listen to call at 8:30 am"
8 year low?
"Slb was at 36-37 just weeks ago. , look for Slb to get back to 33-35 plus soon , capitulation upwards, and stay in 30-40 range , or better, next 2 quarters , opinion only g luck"
"I am so behind on this one, its sad. I bought at 60 and some today. Avg cost is 57. Long way to go.. But , hey, we got dividend :)"
A 1.6% yield. Most inventors roll the payout onto the shares removing shares from the market. The stock has zero appeal at these levels. Higher dividend or lower price..
$32 by end of month
SLB needs to reinstate the dividend to pre-pandemic levels!
"If I had a pile of cash, I would be buying SLB and ready for a huge gain. Instead, I will wait. QE4 and ARAMCO IPO are the stock props of 2019. Methinks."
"Good signs of a bottom forming. No massive selloffs on a $0.5 decline in oil price, people buying on the dip. Many oil stocks already pulled back 20 - 40% in the last couple months so that may be enough correction for the current still bullish environment for oil and oil stocks."
"Lot of folks bullish on exploration and production. But not on services since shale is cutting back on capex. Any opinions? My only thought is that oil services still can do PLENTY of business outside of the US, and sooner or later US shale will come calling"
I wouldn’t short $SLB. This company has made serious structural changes last three years. It’s going to $70 or higher. Oil prices and higher oil patch activity is on its side.
"In my many decades of investing, I find that usually when the news is out. The stock has already priced it in.So when the demand gets back to normal, this stock will already reflect it.So buying it now gives the investor a better chance of a gain then waiting for the news that the market has recovered to previous levels."
"@sandorclegane Ahhh so you're a trader where most are investors. They have the same opinion on SLB but you play the swings. You can't call long term holders ""pumpers"" when they take a long term view, ride out the volatility but end up at the same destination. Same opinion different strategy doesn't equal a ""pumper"". See you in the $40s."
"From what I understand OIH has the highest short interest (EXCLUDING March 2020 pandemic) since 2012. I believe OIH was restructured in 2011. So historically speaking the short interest is high, not by definition, but specifically for OIH based off of past data. Could we see a squeeze in the near term?"
SLB Just mentioned on cnbc halftime report as a top pick for oil on its way to $80/barrel
Green in a sea of red today. That rotation is looking stronger and stronger. Can't wait for the institutional investors to wake up and pile in. #reflation #reopening
will be over 30 in few
Oil up SLB down. Oil down SLB down. Stock is toast.
"Revs below 2019(expected from pandemic) but operating margins higher than 2019, meaning more money is hitting the bottom line. Revs and margins will continue to increase well into 2022. Operating leverage increasing substantially. If oil heads into the $80s then we will see future revs blow out consensus estimates. Upward & Onward! Remain patient."
"People need to realize that the entire market is coming down. It’s not just one individual Stock. Remember when stocks start to rebound then tend to rebound hard the first few days for big gains. The best of the best companies will be be the ones to first rebound. Slb is one of those companies, revenue at about $35 billion a year, this stock at current price is a joke. This is all short selling and end of the year tax loss selling. 5% dividend while you wait I think is well worth the investment. I have to say I got in at 56.90 1250 shares. Sure it doesn’t feel good to be down as much as I am but it’s not something that I will lose sleep over. Don’t need the money anytime soon, I collect the dividend and know that recovery will happen and eventually tide will turn and an uptrend will happen. Remember the entire sector is down. Good luck to all."
(PE)PURE ENERGY MINERALS LIMITED / (SLB) are they entering into a joint venture NEOLITH?
"Oil went up last week by $4 - oil stocks did nada. Oil goes down $1.5, oil stocks crash..."
"Headline after headline about climate problems and oil consistently vilified and yet demand is going to surpass it's all time high soon. Why is there never an industry counter argument? Why does everyone in oil hide instead of stand up and call it what it is: Without oil, world civilizations would be plunged back into the stone age. Period. No commerce. No flights. No trucks. No plastics. No cosmetics. No petrochemicals. No medicines. The list is endless."
Refreshing to see for a change oil stocks up when oil price is down. Maybe we finally turned a corner on this nasty bear market in oil stocks and people started putting things in perspective: $68/bbl oil is not the end of the oil industry... many oil stocks are flat or only slightly higher ytd despite a 50% increase in oil price and improvement in capex spendings.
Oil supplies coming down Oil Price going upEvery one has there price.what price would it be before even you consider drilling. When there is money to be made oil services will be required.The boom starts now.
The analysis on SLB values it north of 40$. Any thoughts on hitting that number prior to the end of the year?
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."

Record travel during 4th of July weekend will take oil prices towards $85+
"""Street ViewCitigroup analyst Scott Gruber remains bullish on the stock. “Schlumberger remains our top pick in oilfield services given their leverage to recovery abroad, margin expansion prospects, and free cash flow generative business model,” he wrote in a client note cited by Barron’s."
"SLB is arguably the best in its field.....but SLB’s customers face some difficult times ahead. Oil is soft with little reason to believe prices will get much higher anytime in the next several years. It was impossible and illegal for the US to export oil just a few years ago. Today the US exports are some 2 million barrels per day. The Saudis are going public at least in part because oil prices are low and there appears to be no upside in putting off their ipo. Cashing in before prices drop further?Eastman Kodak was once considered the most successful company in the history of the world. Technology changed and Kodak didn’t keep up. Today, there are Milenials for whom the name Kodak is no more familiar than Montgomery Ward.....I AM NOT and advocate of electric cars (yet) but they are coming and coming fast. BMW, VW, Mercedes and Volvo are all planning or building electric car facilities in the south. Ford is designing pick ups. GM is planning numerous models and just announced a JV battery facility with LG.SLB’s customers are oil producers. Oil producers, as a group are seriously in debt...debt that is currently 10 X profits while there is LITTLE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OIL PRICES WILL RISE ANYTIME SOON. Bankruptcies cannot be far off. Seven months ago, SLB took a first step into Lithium, the product that many believe will replace oil in powering automobiles. In the seven months since that first step, SLB has done almost nothing toward taking a second step. By comparison, in those same seven months, Apple has released three new iPhones and their wireless EarPods that are expected to generate more that $2 billion in the next several months.SLB needs to decide quickly whether it wants to follow Apple or Kodak.JMHO"
Why should SLB be down after such excellent earnings report? I could Not believe it at all. SLB IS A GREAT SOLID COMPANY. IT SHOULD BE IN THE $50'S.
"Folks might be your last chance to BUY Slb in the high 20s, Slb should hit 30 soon , on its way to 35-37 range,BUY now or youll look back saying should of bought at 29 range, opinion only g luck"
SLB must increase div by 50% to backup claim that the outlook. is good. Also because oil industry not viewed by the street as a growth industry. SLB needs to buy back stock.
"Keep loading up on Slb going back to 35 fast, then tier up to 40sOpinion only g luck"
Historically SLB should be crossing above $40 with oil crossing above $65. Wait for it.
"Nice move today. Crude looks to be going to 45 then pull back at year end, then up towards 50 Q1. I'm holding SLB until at least $35."
"Getting ready for the bounce back up. The RSI is strong in the bullish zone and the MACD is trying to cross back up, according to daily chart at foxchart."
Yesterday druid oil was up 2 % Today cruide oil down 0.2% We came with good Earning market up from yesterday and today 400-500 point and we are down I guess we need a very bad news so we can go up
"I remember 1986 meeting wise old man in library while researching stocks. He explained to me about buying quality companies with PE of 12 or less....simpler times back then of course, but some things still hold true. PE of 12 or less with 4.5% safe dividend will Always be a true value buy. After our conversation I went out and bought #SLB (which he recommended at the time) and made a lot of money over the years before moving on from that stock, but his wisdom still resonates in my long term buys. Even in Market downturns, a few select stocks should be held as core holdings, while trading any extra capital for the swing trades. #VZ fits this almost to a T.....and that doesn't mean AT&T."
"Hope this move helps - Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE: SLB) has promoted Olivier Le Peuch to COO, effective immediately, according to a Feb. 8 press release."

"Jefferson- I agree that oil is getting beat up but it’s never going completely away. We still need gas for cars, oil to heat our homes and businesses, not to mention oil is used to make many products today."
this held up pretty nice today comp. to others. Risk on names got hammered
"I never considered buying an oilfield service company stock, because of uncertainty of oil prices, until I saw SLB at $13. We all know what its earnings potential is with ""normal"" oil prices and demand, so on that basis I bought 2,000 shares. Essentially, my bet is that within 5 years, normal will return and I'll be collecting a nice $1 per share dividend. $2 dividend would be really sweet."
Irresistible. Introduced a new posn in my portfolio.
Great earnings report It should go up to $30's.
The financial times reports an existential crisis in the oil sector: they don't know wether they should enjoy the massive increase in earnings or not....this sector is run by Jr. High school level moralizing .
"It will be interesting to see if SLB will become a Lithium brine well developer now that the test resultsfrom the Clayton Valley well have been released on the Pure Energy property. The well SLB drilled is an 8"" well potentially ready for Lithium brine extraction. (PEMIF) partnership with SLB could be a new direction for the company. Clayton Valley is approx 200 miles south of Tesla/Panasonic Gigafactory."
I live by the airport. The planes have started to come/go just like in 2019. All my co-workers booking vacations at far-off destinations. Traffic is back on our freeways. Lack of investment in oil production is going to jack-up prices big time. In CA gas is $4.00+ per gallon. Do yourself a favor and buy this or some other oil stocks so you don't feel so bad each time you pay $60+ to fill your gas tank.
After reading all the marvelous opinions I started a position today.
"If you want to invest in Energy, SLB should be on the top of your list, Great management, Excellent technology, great balance sheet. I am a buyer at these levels under $30."
"What price does oil have to go to for this stock to reach 40? $85,$90 or $100 per barrel?"
"Morgan Stanley’s Connor Lynagh upgraded Schlumberger to Overweight, while keeping the price target unchanged at $51."
Next week should be good with oil poised to go back above $70 and oil stocks extremely oversold / undervalued after a 3 month bear market which took them 25% - 40% down on average. We just need to break this ugly trend.
"this price is a gift to buyers, Shorts taking what they can before great earnings come out soon, Slb will be around along time as they also Transition towards the future, Slb is a top oil company in the oil sector, and will climb back to 35 plus soon, dont let the Shorts fool you, stay long and strong, squeeze coming soon, BUY BUY opinion only g luck"
"We’ve been in a bear market since 2014, SLB has enough free cash flow and cash on hand too continue paying the dividend. It’s the waiting game boys."
Moving up slower than Oil price. Time for Dividend increase and $30. Any hope guys?
Can the oil stocks hold steady with spot falling?
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company just awarded SLB with a $381M contract. Earnings next week should give us a better free cash flow understanding.
"FYI, market cap ytd , has gone from ,25b to 40b ruffly, this stock under $30 is a HUGE gift, especially oil sector starting to rotate up up up, so BUY SLB , LOCK in on Compounding Dividend, and AFTER you BUY your SLB Shares, Put in a SELL order at $75 tie your shares up, and if already long , put in a sell order as well, opinion only , g luck"

Halliburton reports tomorrow morning. Could be a catalyst here. Just saying.
and Morgan Stanley with a buy and PT of $51. upside looks good. Div safe and will be maintained per new CEO. We shall see. I am betting on it!!!! Good luck longs. If this old best of breed bird straightness out we will be very happy.
"this is what happens when algorithms do the trading, they sometimes way overshoot and give us excellent buying opportunities."
Just bought more at $26.03 for average cost basis of $26.5 (sold a couple of months ago at $33 so can't complain). Oil is taking a nasty dip today but I believe it will recover - demand is strong and the likelihood of covid-like lockdowns is close to zero. This is just the best buying opportunity since early last year when covid hit.
Who is selling?
"Folks take this delta variant correction, which will be just a bleep, almost 70% vaccination now, everyone much more knowledgeable now on virus bs, not scared of the unknowns anymore, so take advantage of this drop and BUY BUY BUY, remember how quick Slb popped up to 36 just a few weeks ago on oil news, now opec stabilizing, so less unknowns about oil futures now looking forward, so Slb will start climbing back to 30-35 pretty quickly now, big hitters will start rolling in this stock now it’s been beat down 1 too many times, Slb is one of the giants in oil sector, and they also are converting things over looking towards future energy prospects and ventures, take the horrible Compounding dividend…they need to raise it even if only slightly, anyhow lock in on the dividend and this low Gift price today, opinion only g lick"

"Volatility building for a positive swing when stimulus gets passed. Expect a big pop and price upgrades in the near future! Huge positive cashflow for SLB; no way this company is going under!!!!! Don't be afraid, as Wall Street says."
I'm going to wait and see if the dust settles at 25 or so. Plenty of oil stocks cratering now before earnings.
Oil will be going up as these hurricanes start coming
"Huge MC, Huge revenues , and cash flow, Under 30 is a Huge chance to Buy SLB at a great discount, opinion only g luck"
"Upside for SLB share price is big. In 2018, the oil price is about the same as it is now, SLB was traded over $70. By IEA, OPEC+ recoverable oil has gone down by 9% over the last year only. The world will see a huge oil shortage in the next couple of years (once COVID threat is under control), which will boost the oil price exponentially."
Why falling?
Capitulation $38 will mark the bottom. Mark this post. Company will be around next 100 years. Buy now come back next year this time and see your money doubled. Be patient.

"Anyone still works at SLB here? In my brief HAL stay, SLB was always considered a better place to work as it was less cut throat and people were not shunted around so much. This is back in in 2012-2013 time frame. So what has changed?"
Oil will outperform the stock market this year.
When are next earnings coming out?
Load up under 29!!!This is a Huge Buy under 29 look for Slb to pop up into 32-37 range next few weeks$Opinion only g luck
Why is SLB lagging its peers in this Oil recovery? Big time lagging. Like by 25%.
Schlumberger's 37% equity stake (33.8M share) in Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT) last fall has increased 60% in value since the deal closed. Nice move!
Patience.. it had been depressed for a while. There is not much room left downwards. Upside is just huge... I am loading a lot
When management is buying shares I’m buying shares! $SLB
Cramer said don't buy so it is time to slowly back up the truck and loadup.
Best time to buy an umbrella cheap is on a sunny day.Best time to buy a stock is when it's raining.Conclusion: Accumulate 
"Typical for SLB great earning and short institutional owners dump shares short to crash retail and make a bundle. The new norm buy the rumor of great earnings expected and then sell the news and trap new bag holders. Oil up, Dow up. SLB fantastic ER and ran up to 28.70 and then crashed. Algo's and games. Good buy I think at 28.00 range. Oil is pricy and will stay high."
"As predicted, even the slightest pullback in oil prices causes a selloff. We're back in a bear market in oil stocks, even though oil prices are at a 5 year high!"
"June 3rd, Schlumberger announced higher guidance of revenues, ebitda, and margins for 2021. On that day, the stock rose 7% to $35.45Fast forward 6 weeks, and I expect that theme to continue. Today's price is a gift to those accumulating shares."
This is it!. This stock shall rise from here. Congrats to those who stayed the course. The No.1 service company will come out victoriously and we all will profit.
"You would think oil was selling for $50 a barrel. I believe the company has made major operating changes over last several years, So oil over $60 is a great moneymaker. But market determines the price even if it is not logical."
This should head to $55 by March. It will consolidate around this price for a little but then start to trend higher. We should get some good pre announcements going into second quarter earnings earnings.
i am an slb employee... and believe me...the company IS the king of oil services... so just hang on there ... it will come back...not now but in the very near future... my advice : ACCUMULATE!!
I think the shares would pop 20% if Paul was replaced
Earning not doing squat for the share price today
"I'm long SLB, but don't stick your head in the sand about what's going on today.(Bloomberg) -- Oil headed for the biggest weekly loss since mid-March as a resurgence of Covid-19 threatened the outlook for global fuel demand demand.Futures traded around $72 a barrel in New York, and are heading for a weekly decline of 3.5%. The fast-spreading delta variant is triggering renewed restrictions on movement as it sweeps across the globe, eroding fuel consumption in several Asian countries that had buoyed the recovery.At the same time, crude markets face the prospect of extra supplies from the OPEC+ coalition, as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia repair a rift that has stymied the group’s decision-making process. A stronger dollar has also dimmed the appeal of commodities priced in the U.S. currency this week."
Schlumberger and Panasonic are partnering on SLB's lithium production pilot plant. If this works out as planned it should be a game changer in the lithium battery business. Imagine every EV powered by Schlumberger/Panasonic batteries! The future looks very bright!
"Do you all forget that earnings will be out tomorrow morning? The estimates appear to be easy to BEAT, considering the oil price has almost doubled in the last several months. Likely to see $28's tomorrow..."

"Slb is more then a oil play it’s a technology stock now in many ways with new innovations in the oil sector and beyond.You can own this massive company Slb in a beat down sector But every time oil heads to 70 plus Slb hits 30-36 range plus dividend SLB is a HUGE BUY as Delta scare fades , opinion only g luck folks"
"Hurricanes are crimping demand and supporting oil prices, while creating work for the oilfield servicers."
"oil investors know, SLB is a 40-70$ dollar stock all day longoil has been beat down too longwe saw how quick slb jump to 37 just weeks ago off oil prices and news, and rest assured, after this DELTA speed bump, cars planes will be rolling FULL speed, id argue they already are close to full speed, just a Delta speed bump, but economy is opening fast with or without mask, as soon as Delta passes, next few weeeks,SLB and oil will roll, look for SLB to test that 37 level soon, opinion only g luck"
"And here we go... Our new leader has exited the field of dreams and has seen the darkness for what it is., Cutting to reality,, always more to cut, more to trim.. You know that term Digital, keep that in mind as all these high skilled positions go automated. Regrettably, things change and in order to thrive, survive, a company must sometimes change direction and refocus. Way more to come...Long and strong for the rough ride to come.. GL2A"
Earnings tomorrow...Thoughts?
"If the market foresees the market 6 months in advance, oil will be over $70 and SLB be over $40."
"$27 - $28 should be a good entry point. We are not far from there. We're in an extremely bearish sentiment right now, even though oil prices are high historically. It will turn at some point. The industry is still recovering and improving by the day. Keep your heads up and don't let the shorts take your money!"
I would hope that the write downs the company has had over the last couple of years would have made it lean enough to handle $50+ oil prices.So $60+ WTI and $65+ Brent would be a moneymaker.
oil at $74.5 - oil stocks still selling off like there's no tomorrow.
"Wait for the ""short squeeze move"", the shorts have been correct on stock price, and have made alot of money on this stock and other XLE stocks. How much more do they want, they have ""Buy To Close"" their short positions sometime. I' ve seen it before in SLB, a $1 move up, is many times followed by a $1.90 move up the next day.Hedge funds have a strangle hold on XLE and SLB, make sure you 7/31, and some 1/15 Call options, they can manipulate it for a few days more. The EU threw a nice curve ball today, against the ""shorts""."
"Moody just came out with a stellar report about Schlumberger. We already knew about solid balance sheet and great management. Now with oil prices higher and consumption tricking upward, just a matter of weeks before SLB will be in the 30s range. Great time to buy."
21.15 was weekly high.as long as we close above 20.5; we could see 25-27 with some luck.. IMO within few month or so.
Give me more at these prices. These are the steals to be found.
"Whether the price of oil is low or not, when you lose half of the value it's time for a leadership change! It takes bold leadership to make unpopular moves to drive the stock price higher. Cameron was a bold move, but not the right one. It's been a downward spiral since the acquisition. Do something bold; reduce the headcount by 10% (layoffs, early retirements, hire freeze), sell (or kill) non-performing units and property (lease back). Lastly, change leadership..all of it!"
I see a double bottom on back to back days almost to the penny. And if U go back to July 19th another bottom almost to the penny. Monday is huge for SLB. If it can hold I think it has a run up coming. Of it can#$%$ next test is 24.50.
it looks like oil stocks are trying to break some #$%$ record of 10 down days in a row...
Big earnings beat incoming
"Go HIGHER starting tomorrow...XOM, BP will report earnings premarket...."
Energy sector portfolio weighting is approximately 3%. It can go as high as 16%. We will feel the floor move below our feet when the largest institutions put their money into the best performing sector thus far. There will be a flood of dry powder entering the space over the next year due to the economy expecting 3-5 years worth of travel over the next 9 months. $OIH $XLE
I bought a bunch of shares along with OIH shares. Oil stocks are goi g to go off in the second half of the year.
"As long as OIL goes down, SLB will go down as well. The weird thing is that when OIL was $25 few years ago, SLB was around $60. Now OIL is $45, SLB is $35. So now I guess the lower stock price of SLB is more as of result of short sellers rather than fundamentsls."
Sure feels like capitulation. Started buying at $27.85. Ready to add.
"Never made any sence whatsoever. Copied but a great read....Roughly 20% of electric vehicle owners in California replaced their cars with gas ones, a new study shows.The main reason drivers made the switch was the inconvenience of charging.The findings suggest new challenges facing the growth of the nascent electric vehicle market.See more stories on Insider's business page.In roughly three minutes, you can fill the gas tank of a Ford Mustang and have enough range to go about 300 miles with its V8 engine.But for the electric Mustang Mach-E, an hour plugged into a household outlet gave Bloomberg automotive analyst Kevin Tynan just three miles of range.Related: Inside the $170K solar car that drives 500 miles on one charge>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<"
"Looks like oil is heading into the 80's. Don't know how long it will take but it seems almost inevitable. There's been massive under-investment in exploration and oil production in the past year and a half. With all these stories about the EV revolution and peak demand being behind us, it's no surprise that very few were willing to invest in oil E&P and even now with oil in the 70's, oil companies are very hesitant to invest. So now even if OPEC puts back its entire capacity on the market, it may not be enough, given that a lot of supply destruction occurred - some of it for good - as a result of under-investment and there simply isn't going to be enough supply. Triple digit oil is a distinct possibility. All of this is great news for oil stocks."
In case y’all missed it - one major analyst has dropped coverage and Tudor Pickering has set a sale sign on with a price target of $35...
"Only reason this is under 30 is Delta What a joke, yes it for a short time slows some travel but delta runs it’s course for 4-6 weeks This stock is going to mid 30s very soon … opinion only g luck"
They need to raise the DIV. Big Time. Are going to lose retail investors if they don’t. 1.5%? Really?
I told you back then to sell at $34. Now $28 would be my entry point which will leave you a potential of 20%+ return over the next 12 months as the price target of $35 is realistic.
"we can post all day long on here, BUT bottom line is....Smart Money needs to pick there spot to come into Oil Sector again especially SLB a giant, you can still by this under 30?????Ive been posting back the truck up. load up on SLB UNDER 30, Smart money has to know SLB is not staying under 30 MUCH longer, oil tipping 70s-100 possible, Oil Sector and stocks, ready to Cycle back into Favorwith investors, SO , Dont Bottom Fish, you snooze youll lose, Big Money and Volume coming into SLB soon, going to 30-40 Range very soon, opinion only g luck"
"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"

"No need to guess what the near term holds for SLB. They just told us:Schlumberger expects to ''materially grow'' margins and cash flow in near to medium term - CEOBY Reuters— 9:38 AM ET 09/08/2021DENVER, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Schlumberger NV, the world's leading oilfield service provider, expects to materially grow its margins and cashflow over the medium and short term horizons, Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said on Wednesday.The company expects to reach adjusted EBIDTA margins of 25%, or a 500 basis point expansion from pre-pandemic levels, over that period. It expects to continue generating double-digit free cash flow margins and restore return on capital employed to double digits in the short to medium term, Le Peuch said.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Denver)"
"Why is this falling? The numbers are correct,company is doing good.."
Tesla dropping as they missed recent sales forecasts due to reduced tax credits. It has cut prices across the board on all of its vehicles to try and stimulate sales. The idea for its brand seems to be fading as its tax supports disappear. That oil is with us for the long term appears a solid bet. I’ve always wanted to own SLB and glad I bought in at less than $36/sh. On pure value buoyancy pressure this stock should pass $40 within the next 30 days.
Great Report! Listened to the call. These guys have a firm understanding of where they are and where they will be in the short and long runs. Buy the stock and enjoy the ride to $40 or higher over the next 12 to 18 months
"There it is, a new high!!!! Energy demand looking strong for several years to come since alternatives are limited and lack the ability to meet demand like traditional oil. Oil going to $80+ over the summer but these companies can do just fine in the current price range. Remember you have to be positioned to reap the benefits of the most significant growth days. When will those days be, who knows but being that we are lagging in price (OIH) they're coming so be prepared in order to be significantly rewarded in this space. Don't trade, hold! GL"
Will crash to the bottom! Grow profit that’s a laugh
Does anyone know why SLB is going down? I don’t see any news.
"This is the time in a market cycle where undo global issues have affected the oil industry. It's a time when small fortunes are made. SLB's prospects from here-on are enormous. Still, the real fortunes will be made from outfits like SM Energy, Transocean and Whiting Petroleum."
I have 1250 shares $56.70
Morgan Stanley increase SLB PT to $40 from $32 this morning.
Let’s be real here this stock is way under valued when demand for oil picks up and the oil operators decide to bring oil wells back online who do u think they are employing. It will be slb an Hal. These stocks are easily going double
In the next several years the company well diversify into non-oil and gas fields. They will also will pick up more opportunities from the majors in drilling and completions.That is why I believe the company’s stock will get back to the 60’s in the next couple of years.
Slb reports on the 23 rd should be through the roof hold tight. The shorts are going to fry.
"Oil going up, trading volume down. Sellers are diminishing."
"Did oil drop to $60. With being down 5%, one has to wonder!"
With oil at 75 this should be at $50 or more
"Stephanie Link on CNBC likes SLB at this price. Said they have a good balance sheet. She's often right with her calls, she got the banks right several months ago."
"Wake up, oil is up 2% !"
holding this on a long term.. very good upside.. on risk to reward... buying it everytime it goes lower... electric will never really replace oil... planes can't be flying with batteries lol
"Jul. 15—U.S. oil-field services and equipment companies added thousands of jobs in June as oil producers continued to bring more rigs online to meet recovering demand for petroleum products.Employment in the sector, dominated by companies like Halliburton ( HAL), Schlumberger ( SLB) and Baker Hughes ( BKR ), rose by an estimated 8,000 jobs, or 1.3 percent, in June, the fourth consecutive month of growth. Texas accounted for more than half of the job growth, estimated to be more than 4,400 jobs, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics analyzed by Houston trade group Energy Workforce & Technology Council."
"Big thanks to Stephanie Link on CNBC,, great call to buy SLB at 21, 25,... I'm still buying..."
Guys you really need to start attempting to be more informed SLB share price is more correlated to the expected growth of the fossil fuel marketplace than it is the spot price of crude. The EU announced plan for achieving carbon neutralality is what is spooking the market.
"Oil up by $10 /bbl => oil stocks yawn. Oil down by $0.20 => let's sell everything, the end is near!!"
So do i buy XOM or SLB if i want to wait for the uptick in the oil market ? I patient it will go back up. Just wondering which play would be better.
I bought a few shares at $51 and a few more near $50. It was shortly thereafter I knew I had made a mistake. Long term chart shows $40 to $45 minimum. There is absolutely no reason to rush into this dog and I'm glad I just nibbled on a few shares.
"In my last post I said to expect SLB to hit $40 within the next 30 days. I did not think it would hit $40 this soon but I guess I was right, just not more clairvoyant. Shale output which has kept SLB down in 2018 faces market doubts that it can supply the increase to keep up with north American demand in 2019.This situation plus two others, the negative sentiment agains Tesla and its segment as well as the economic news of American employment hitting all time highs tells me that there are just to many uplifting vectors for SLB. Add in its valuation and divvy buoyancies andI think this equity will be forced up to the $50 level in short order. Key to this outcome and a possible pullback (a buying opportunity in my view) will be its quarterly ER coming later this month."
"Conjecture only......now if today isnt enough to get MM and Brokerage firms and Big Buyers to start coming into SLB and the oil sector, when is a good time,,Powell said enough to assure folks today, as well as oil going up to 70s soon, Delta is only a speed Bumpso Lock in on SLB at this LOW UNDER 30 BUY Price, and compounding dividend, opinion only g luck"
I love the service guys but am trying to make a short work him about 3500 at 15.57. I think I will cover Monday. In 45 days I think this is above 17-18 and crude is 44 ish in its way to 49-53 next year opec is in control again. Buying banks on dips only
I don't know about you guys but I'm turned on by this earnings report!!!!!
"When the world is completely reopen and the threat of Covid is minimal (India, China & US) we could be looking at 2014 highs in a very short period of time. We are literally coming out of over a decade long bear oil market and entering an oil bull market that has some legs to it(covid has severely depressed valuations). Reflation! Looking for oil to take out the $68 resistance level over the next few weeks and start to push towards $80."
Bought at 60.91
div cut + bad earnings + terrible outlook = great buying opportunity
Cramer doesn't like this stock so I guess it's a buy then

"I bought OIH near the top so dollar cost down by buying SLB, which is 25% of OIH. I think this has plenty of room to run."
"If the stock goes down tomorrow, double down - buy more. it is a good company, good cash flow. Oil is cheap due to Trump politics. By summer time things will be better. Oil will go up."

"Oil prices are recovering yesterday's losses. Will oil stocks do the same? If judging by recent price action, oil can move up by $10 with oil stocks doing nothing, yet a $1 decline in the price of oil causes a selloff.."
"Just what Ive been waiting for, buying a little at a time. Wow, never thought I’d be able to build SLB shares into my portfolio this early. SLB has entered into the batt grade lithium market. Extraction Tech is the new game"
Good earnings call. Very upbeat about the coming quarters. Divestitures coming soon to enhance margins and shore up the balance sheet. Seems a steady stream of positive news for the stock in the coming months. Hopefully pushing us past that elusive $30’handle.

anyone else like this for long term. Next 5 years. Core holding.
Oil was $26 a barrel in early 2016. Anybody know what the price of SLB was? About the same price it is now. Very strange indeed!
"This is one of very few oilfield services comanies i am comfortable investing in now a days. The balance sheet strength and earning power is there. Free cash flow generation good. If they are hard pressed they will reduce dividends , but overall the company is on strong footing."
Is SLB in some kind of financial distress? I did some research but have not found anything that would suggest that they cannot service their debt in the near term. This is the granddaddy of all the oil services companies ....one would think that they can weather this. Thank about this ...SLB market cap $20B ...Tesla market cap $90B???
Bought 5000 shares at 15.7. Try to buy more at 15.5 but was unsuccessful. With vaccines on the horizon this should be higher in 1-2 months. Suspect the earnings will be good this Friday given the CEO bought the stock recently. If it falls tomorrow I’ll buy more.
Easy quarter beat!
"This is how a REAL company operatesRDSWe are stepping up our shareholder distributions today, increasing dividends and starting share buybacks,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement. “The quality of Shell’s operational and financial delivery and strengthened balance sheet have given the board confidence.”"
"SLB wants to test 30s again, Just needs some SUSTAINED BIG BUYING VOLUME days and oil Hit 70s, no doubt theres a BUNDLE of Money/MM looking to come in SLB, and timing is everything,the LOW LOW volume /Shortys the only reson SLB not up over 30, it was around 37 just weeks ago,when oil news and oil popped over 70s, SO BUY BUY BUY , SLB plus dividends, DONT BOTTOM FISH, the LOW VOLUME days on SLB are going to CHANGE FAST and Shorty will be BUYING BACK SHARES when BIG VOLUME MM come in BUYING BIG VOLUMES OF SLB, GO LONGS.......opinion only g luck folks"
if OPEC is expanding production that's good for SLB business. These announcement s are net-net positive to me.
"HAL poised to drop under $5, yikes! Nobody remembers the Great Depression because most of those folks are gone. 85%-95% declines in even bellwether stocks were not uncommon. HAL is down 83% from its year high. HAL is not the exception to the rule. It is the base case, and maybe not just for oil service stocks. There are going to be an astonishing number of bankruptcies as a given for most small companies (see the Russell 2000 almost cut in half already with a long way to go) and more than a few in the S&P 500 as well. Survivors will be virtually debt-free and self-funding. They may be the only survivors, other than ones bailed out. But even the bailed out will probably have to financially restructure and wipe equity. We have not even begun to feel the economic impact yet, aside from a shortage of toilet paper."
"Buy at this level and dip, Slb was at 36 range just a few weeks ago and will hit 36-39 range soonWhen Slb increases its dividend , even slightly, this stock will climb steadily time for a dividend increase !Opinion only g luck"
"Judging from the options activities, it will be above $24 by the end of next week. Mark this post."
They had some interesting insights about SLB on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Bought at 22,23,34,27 Avg about 27. Sitting pretty . I will sit on this position for about 5 years. Looking good."
