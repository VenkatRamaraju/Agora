zts having a crash out of the blue? looks like market control of big hunk of shares. pets no longer big business? animal drugs no longer profitable?
I have always wanted to buy this stock but keep missing it. I know we are up big today. Buts what a good entry point?
"we had a really good day, and nobody owns it, or what?luck"
"$ELAN is the next $ZTS they are consolidating the $BAYRY animal health business and will emerge as a big winner. The time is now for animal health, how many people do you know who have recently got a companion pet?"
Amazing company. Congrats to those who bought this years ago.
92.8 close today. nice rebound off 86.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking.
this is a nest egg investment. just look at the chart. if I was rich I'd go all in in Zoetis
"Librela - How big can that become for ZTS? There is rought 90M pet dogs in US and the same goes for Europe. That is 180M pet dogs of which 40% is expected to suffer from osteoarthritis and Librela has been a real miracle cure that is coming up a lot now in the pet owners discussions. We have 4 dogs and already two of them are on this drug plus in our near family there is also a dog enjoying the benefit of this drug and I have heard from many others how amazing the reaction has been to this drug. It costs around 50 euros here and it is recommended to be taken once a month. Now I am not aware how much sales this drug is already bringing overall and I do not know if it's been disclosed as I am a newbie on ZTS, frankly I got interested in ZTS just because of the Librela craze.If anyone has more info on the sales, that would be interesting - thanks!"
"Wow, revenues. up 9.3 percent with companion animal revenues up 18.9 percent. This is one of my favorite companies/stocks right now. Add more on pull backs"
Nice surprise. Earnings and revenues jumped. Plus their patients don’t sue!
Could we see 20% up tomorrow?
hoping for a dividend increase but i will believe they have better use for their profits and thus not be concerned :) no complaints to date so won't change now
Why the nosedive???
$ZTS 105 price target by mid-May. Let’s see what earnings bring.
ZTS beats the estimate. Yayyy
big time pet product growth
"JUST HOLD THIS STOCK ""ZTS"" 40% A YEAR FOR YEARS TO COME ZOETIS IS A GREAT COMPANY"
