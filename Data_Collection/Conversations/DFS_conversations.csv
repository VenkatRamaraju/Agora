"What is a reasonable price target for DFS, say by July 1, 2021 and Dec 31, 2021?"
"If you take a look at the 8-K DFS filed yesterday, they acknowledged owning over 26M shares of MQ currently valued at roughly $800M after MQ just went public. DFS will report this stake and its value as of 6/30 in its next earnings report. This will add roughly $2.60/share in additional EPS above and beyond what they are already doing in the business. That's going to be bullish for the share price."
I think its time to buy DFS.Strong company at a big discount. Buy a dollar for .75 cents!
$46 Friday?
Woohoo Got in at 27.62 in April - but only 100 shares
Time to buy bank more - Thank you fed $BAC $JPM $AXP $C $DFS - gold mine
"The last time DFS traded at this price was in June of 2012!Book value per share: $36.42Price per share: $37.12Cash per share: $22.46People are still using credit cards from home and DFS is pretty much an online business. In my subjective personal opinion, this stock is quite undervalued, given a long term perspective."
Big EPS helped substantially by release of prior quarters loan loss reserves. Nevertheless a positive quarter. Maybe a dividend boost later in the year.
anyone use their high yielding savings account? thinking of making the switch
just picked up 100 shares of DFS to get started. lots of room left more than V
Lots of strength around 37.20 & 40. Looking good for daily gain.
"Alex Alex , it may retest 37-38. patience my man. long term baby and just enjoy life"
I tried to warn you. $22
Bought 1200 shares today
just a quick thought. is noone scared of a global recession. i have been buying cheaply priced stocks but I think this is all going up way to quick
"Great stuff, already plus 10 points off my jan 27 add. happy i had the chance, Onwards!"
what's the deal on the drop?
solid play. slow and steady rising.
One of my better one day trades... I’m excited for the long term
"People are ready to get out and charge. People live off of debt---this will not change anytime soon. Discover fell much further than Amex, Visa, MC....so the bounce will be better as can be seen with the bounce today. Either way, it is a buy for the long run. A year from now it is likely that this will have revisited the previous highs. The risk reward over a year to 2 years is very very positive"
Any idea why the significant price drop on DFS today?
See how V reacted today--DFS is one of Goldman's top 12 financial picks in a strong financial/banking group!
Why the big drop?
"RSI of 28 --yea, this is WAY oversold."
"This definitely was one of my better moves, loaded up around $57 per share."
A 35 million dollar fine from 2015 cause for lawsuit?This “hurt” Discover?Seriously ?
Any input on how would DFS stock perform in negative oil price and PPP depletion.
"Bought in today before earnings. Should have bought a while ago. Worried this is another case of buy the rumor, sell the news."
"Boom! Crush job, stock just keeps getting cheaper, hoping they raise Divy too"
"Have had a Discover Card since 1985. I bought this stock last April $43, because of their great customer service. Should have bought it a long time ago!"
$49.37 Average cost per share... Only problem with the massive gains is that now DFS is such a large part of my portfolio. It still sort of looks like a buy too..... should I sell any before next earnings or just hold this thing forever?
This price point hasn't been seen since 2012 and is a steal in my opinion. Hopefully we'll see $50 in nine days.
"Bought this Chrismas Eve, has been the most relaxing stock in my portfolio of 30 holdings."
"Oversold, back to $130 soon"
"if sustain above 94.5, then we will soon see 105."
Backing up the truck on this one today great buy!!
Obvious profit taking from funds buying at lows this week. Unless I'm missing something on their earnings and outlook I have to believe that we may get upgrades soon and the stock rebound. This market is so manipulated so who knows!
"Discover Financial Services EPS beats by $0.24, revenue in-line"
"If you look at the PE ratio, this stock is still at a great price to buy."
very nice close above 40$. love this stock. every dip I will take a piece of . this will be my largest holding if it stays in 30s next couple of months
No new threads... no one is interested in such a valued investment. currently at 57.08 on 9/28. Look back after December 2020 and see what you have missed.
Look at the financials. DFS is a cash cow. One of my highest conviction holdings.
"Dear Valued Shareholders, Stakeholders, and Potential Investors, We are very excited to let you know we will be making a big announcement next week, which will accelerate the course of PHI Group and is expected to have a tremendous, long-lasting impact on our company’s future.BIG NEWS!!!!! Ticker(PHIL)"
Seaport Research Partners (whoever that is) starts with neutral rating
"Apr. 23, 2020 8:00 AM ETQ1 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call"
Alex I'm think this thing may revisit. in the next week or Soo. just a gut feeling.
Undervalued
why todays hit?
Will people pay their bills? Doesn't discover take that risk on like a bank ?
Either the company goes bankrupt or you make money buying the stock.
Morgan Stanley price target on DFS is $90 share! Great earning today!
"Stock buy back, raised dividend, Then they cut interest pay out from 2.10% to 2.05% in the money market they offer. Did not see any head lines on this issue. Some one had to lose (the savers)"
"I suppose we'll get more clarity on the 22nd, but I like that DFS revenue is the same as last year, unlike WFC which is down around 4 Bil year over year. DFS was a money printing machine before covid. Yes, it is lamer than MA and V, but how this isn't the best bang for your buck blows my mind. The question I have for DFS and the banks: Are the loan loss provisions actually losses? they are posted as expenses, but is money actually going out the door? If not, these stocks will be sandbagged for a big boom if layoffs and the economy don't turn out as bad as expected this fall. WFC predicts heavy unemployment and they are accounting for it, taking a big hit to the dividend and the stock. I own DFS probably because i'm in love with it, lol, but I'm keeping wfc on the watch list. WFC was a dominant bank not to long ago, but in the last few years has definitely created problems for itself."
this is a very well run company and I have been a user of their products and services for over 20yrs with zero complaints. I am confident the stock price will rebound. #Long
So excited! Just added Discover @ 27.82 to my stocks.
Zacks gives it a stay away and the stock goes up 6 points
25 % upside in 6 to 12 months......collect that nice dividend and enjoy !
This is AWESOME. I'm so committed to DFS that I really don't even look at it - I know it's a long winner. Pleasantly caught off guard by the jump though.
What's not to like about those numbers? IT card appears to be bringing in new business.
Way oversold. Great play on financial stocks.
"The fact that this stock is not trading at over $60 just amazes me. They performed better than AXP in the FED's stress test, they are still paying the 0.44 dividend... Their balance sheet looks great, and they have the cash on hand to withstand defaults.. According to the FED they had enough cash on hand to be able to continue their dividends even if the unemployment rate was at 19% for an extended period of time. FOR SURE adding more..."
The concern is credit default. JPM took out nearly $6b in reserves to account for loan losses. However they also had a great quarter for credit account openings.
"Discover Bank is a well run company and its balance sheet without a doubt is pristine. However I have traded in a couple of downturns (2000 & 2008) and with all sincerity and candor implore all longs to, at this time, stay off of margin. Full disclosure, I am bearish and in cash. I personally believe the SP500 is going to test 2,600 If you are in right now, I am not saying to sell. In fact if I were you at this point I would ride the storm out and collect your dividend, which is very safe. However if you are new to investing and wondering what a good entry point is, my take on the situation is that because of uncertainty of loan losses the financials won't bottom until July. I am not saying that DFS will lose money, what I am saying is that the market hates uncertainty. 2ndly: DFS interest spread is being hurt by the FED lowering rates to zero because, if you think about it banks will be lowering the prime rate which is what CC companies base their rates on. And 3rd: DFS will close out a fraction of their lines of credit, and when combined along with the charge offs they will probably have, DFS will take 2 or 3 years to build up their assets to what they were pre-covid. Which means it is going to take 3 years after the recession ends to start earning $9 bucks again. I am holding out till late June when it becomes readily apparent that many of the PPP eligible small companies wont be viable or be able to higher back everyone. Its at that time many mom and pop investors will grasp that financials are going to have a 3rd quarter with earnings worse than the 2nd quarter. IMHO if the SP500 does retest the 2,600 area, then DFS will be around its low of $25. And if the SP500 retests its March lows of 2200 then DFS will become a teenager. Once July earnings season gets here we will all know more. Good luck to all, both longs and shorts, it takes both of us to make a market here in the greatest country. Mr.schnieder"
I got in around 57 per share. Definitely one of my better moves. Anyone getting in now on this current dip I think should do ok
I’m ready to get more. This is so easy. LOAD UP. Great dividend and growth.
Sold all of my AXP and bought DFS
$50 end of May.
Discover Financial reached a 52 Week high at 94.00
Why so red today
"I'm so hyped I got in at $34. This is a diamond in the rough. How can this company be worth 2012 prices. They have beefed up loss reserves, and prepped for this downturn for years. Do not miss this under $40; this is not a cruise line or airline."
"Buying back $1.1B in shares, that’s great news."
No surprise. The the world is in shutdown.. stock already lost almost 60% if it goes down great buy
"On the news that HSBC is going buy one credit card company in US, DFS or SYF?"
"got in today, the first time in the market in approximately 5 or 6 years or so. I am very happy with getting a 5% dividend that I personally am confident of keeping for additional income for years to come. I still have 10% in cash to deploy when we see the employment numbers normalize down the road."
the ceo said that the company is well positioned for 2021 so the outlook is good probably just profit taking
around $40 is probably our new low
One of the quietest boards I've ever seen.
I missed out in 2008 buying financial stocks and lost big opportunities. Not doing that again. Buying small amounts on every dip.
"Curious, anyone have huge position in here? Either before or after the fall?"
"If you back out the reserve release, the Q2 earnings were around $4.50/share, or $18/share annualized, meaning DFS still only trades at a P/E of around 7."
Cheers everyone that bought in the last 2 months. This <50% gain feels real good
quiet board I started a position and will keep adding as we move lower
Added good position yesterday so finger crossed  hopefully 15% upside today and more to come next week as US market is going open for business. Discover $ here.
"Not bad - Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) today reported a net loss of $61 million or ($0.25) per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020, as compared to net income of $726 million or $2.15 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019."
"I’m this has been one of my best performers, why is Morningstar bearish in it?"
"Awesome!!!! Discover Financial Services EPS beats by $1.66, beats on revenue, announces buyback, raises dividend"
This thing is getting ready to trade above $100. All that is needed is a couple of substantial up days in the overall market.
What’s taking so long lol
where do we think this will be end of next week
"Regarding signatures, I am glad to see Discover move away from that.However, I think everyone should be required to have a pin for the credit card.That would make it two form factor and make the credit industry more secure."
Any estimates as to how much Discover will increase their dividend? I say at least 6 cents per share on a quarterly basis.
"When every company cuts its divid, DFS will pay div which tell us they are so strong, and investors like that so this is going up even q2 will be bad"
Is Discover debt safe in this market?
"Okay, so a good buy would be 22 an even better buy is at 1, realistically I think that getting in at anything under 29.99 is a great play. Long term spending will come back quickly and strong, looking for 100 in 5 years. I am long and I’m looking to lower my cost basis. The cheaper the better."
Did they forget today was supposed to be ER day
"With a PE of 29 and market cap of $29B, DFS has a ton more room to grow. It's very cheap."
"yup, $75 soon! Christmas= $85 IMO."
All about a billion dollar reserve built which is reflected in earnings.This is not a total loss but an accounting change for potential writeoffs
"Long term investor, but first time posting. Considering a position in DFS since Visa is now +2% YTD and DFS is still -52% YTD and are both are heavily credit card based. DFS is stuck at around $41 which represents a ~46% drop from $75 (which was the price after previous earnings) which is also coincidentally equal to the revenue drop indicated at Google and Yahoo (shows 46% revenue drop for Q1). I looked into DFS most recent 10-Q and do not see a 46% drop in revenue as it was $2.398B (inline with previous year). I do think there's either an error or Google and Yahoo are reporting a post provision adjustment #. Either case, looks like DFS is getting over penalized."
The number of common shares outstanding has gone from 544 million in May 2011 to the current 306 million in the float. They should be looking at how quickly they can announce and begin an increased amount of buybacks at bargain prices. I love the yield from the growing dividend. Added more today.
Long.
Earnings growing in leaps and bounds as earnings date nears !
There we go.. Right pick at right time.
"CONSUMER BEWAREDiscover dropped my credit line 85%I had a zero balance and paid my statement in full for 5 years. 55 of 60 months paid in full, and over 37 months in a row leading into the decrease.My credit utilization on credit cards is only 10%The Discover card was already one of the lowest credit lines I had open.After the decrease I tried multiple times to get it restored. I cancelled the Discover card after complaining through email to top executives multiple times and the corporate office.They are obviously in a world of hurt if they are cancelling cards and lines of credit to their most credit worthy customers.I would be very wary to do business with Discover in the future. CONSUMER BEWAREYour credit line could be the next to go."
if crosses 84 than 94 is the new stop.. just stay strong.. 5x multipliers in upcoming years.
lot of insiders are buying and hope you do the same. this is a no brainer - buy buy buy
Eps beatrepurchase of shares...upward and onward from here.. proud be a part of Discover family
Want more...? VISA down $8... B of A down $2...Capital One down $11...CITI Down $3..Wells Fargo down $5 all in last 5 days...all credit card comp.
I’m up 202% in one year...very happy. Where does this go from here? I think I will stick around for the upcoming dividend increases....
wow.. great results.. net profit of 2.45 per share
really good to company to hold long term for 2x.
I should have bought nothing but $discover. unbelievable
unemployment benefits ran out. people are going to stop paying bills
DFS had a fantastic quarter. Hard to believe it's not up big this morning. You just never know with earnings releases. I own DFS and Visa and DFS is a much better value (single digit forward PE) and is crushing it.
We won’t be looking back...
"DFS is cheap compared to V, MA, and AXP. Discover isn’t the leader or main innovator in credit cards but neither is AXP and they have twice the PE ratio"
Bought DFS last year when it had fell to around $42/share. Have made a bunch of money on this great company! Thank you DFS!
Discover Financial reached an all time high at 96.89
What is happening to this share?
I am expecting this great company's shares to trade between $103- $107 per share by the end of April.
DFS and AXP holding strong.. love those two. MA and V are over priced imo.
In at $30 during the height of the pandemic. Only wish I had bought more than 30 shares but all I could afford at the time. Can't complain about 300% profit though. Will hold on as long as I can
"I've been building up a chunk of KHC down here too. Like the dividend, like the chart."
funny how 2400 stimulas check and higher unemployment benefits for 2 to 4 months means no one pays their rebt or car payment or min. credit card payments??COME ON!! Are we a society of DEADBEATS? If so...im no longer a PROUD AMERICAN.........and Bernie Sanders wins....
Love discover glad I buy when it was in the mid 40s. I could only afford 20 shares but hey its something
New to trading. DFS is one of my first investments. Invested a week ago at about 35.20 a share. Guessing hold? Probably going to dip and then come back up considering well below for earnings? Would love to hear thoughts/suggestions.
23 Billion in liquidity and 40 Billion in credit line10 Billion mkt capThis is a coiled spring on recovery and an investor sees it and a trader is just that
Please increase the dividend. Give me a reason to hold forever.
I have a student loan and a credit card with discover. Customer service is awesome and everything is so simple and easy.
Worth $90. Wish they were still doing BuyBacks!
$60 stock soon then 80 again and then 100 in a year.
76 shares at $28.75..... let's hope it goes up!
"Watch the chart, possible pull back. Don't be a bag holder or buy in high unless you're L.O.N.G.."
This is an opportunity to buy more for less per share for the long term hold.
"I’m so positive on this stock, hold forever!"
Anyone thinking this will dip after drastically missing earnings?
so many good news. just stick with the stock for long term and 2x to 3x ur money in coming years. revenue will increase by the end of second quarter.
Great buying opportunity! Buying 2x for every $2 it drops
share buybacks and dividends alone make me confident in this one
Started a position today at $37
"Bought 100 shares AH 33.15Dividend is still on table, cost reduction in place...."
I got in last May <$40 so I’m taking profits. I held on for the dividend but just too low now. I’ll hold a core position but shedded some now and looking for value elsewhere. Overall love DFS.
"Cash per share a little over $22, market cap $25.25, book value in the $30's. Who here thinks this company will go bankrupt because of Covid19? I seriously doubt it, especially if they meet their impacted customers half way. I feel comfortable dollar cost averaging in small tranches for a good long while now to lower my cost basis."
Triple digits!?
wheres the gap up?
"No surprise. Like all stocks, was already sold off huge in anticipation of losses. I bought at $33 recently and I will only add. It’ll be double in 4-8 months."
"Was contemplating buying in earlier on Friday but decided not to, and then I got FOMO.Easily hitting $55 for ex divi"
"According to Discover’s history, it has paid 0.44 per quarter for the last 4 quarter showing how it most likely is set for a dividend increase. But with the new article, the fed is telling big banks to retain the same dividend and not increase to save capital. Anyone know if DFS will be following the big banks and will not be aloud to increase even though they can?"
Thanks to the sellers Thurs am who thought earnings were bad. That's called acctg 101Will be a bumpy next few months but this is a long term no brainer as we re-open the USI appreciate the added shares I bought that are up over 10% sinceKeep hoping for a better entry price
I feel this thing has been unfairly punished been adding all the way down guess we'll see
their balance sheet is excellent. I feel safe with this one long term
"Discover Financial Services today reported net income of $771 million or $2.45 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020, as compared to net income of $770 million or $2.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019.. Direct Banking pretax income of $917 million for the quarter was $26 million lower than pretax income for the prior year period..."
This company is not going anywhere. I will keep adding on every drop. Will never get opportunity
one of the most under appreciated stocks there is
I have 65 shares in IRA what would be an entry point for a pullback. I would like to buy 10-20 more shares. Who old 110-116 be a good place to pick up more? Thanks everyone.
this dog needs to be taken out and put down..downgraded to neutral..charge offs rising...out of 9 big bank analysts 1 is bullish 2 are somewhat bullish and 6 are indifferent on DFS...covid issues are maxing out credit cards and the coming mess is going to take this mutt back to 50's..you watch..!
it seems that the announcemen of a quarterly dividend indicates management thinks future prospects look good.
Anyone see 10% profit today when small business application loan hets approved - $DFS
"Sold about 3/4 of my position. Hoping for a gap fill at around the 70 level. If it drops to 65, I’m doubling my original position. Solid long term hold, just hoping for a small consolation for technical’s sake. GLTA"
60S on the road 
"ooof , tough for sorts but longs that buy as things change will be rich. They're saying 1st/2nd quarter going to be rough but 3rd/4th rebound will be like nothing we've seen."
The weekly manipulation is here trying to drive down the price with asks spaced 0.03 apart all the way up to 41. trying to force this stock down so they can buy in low and explode the price. Buy in before it goes to the moon this week.
is the dividend safe?
The only positive i see today is the percentage fall is on par with the blue chips and not 15% like in the past few weeks..
"Down 10% due to missing revenue estimate by $10M -- extreme negative response, seems to me. Revenue up 5% to $2.94B missed expected $2.95B is a 0.3% miss. Looks like investors liked AMEX revenue growth of 9% perhaps selling DFS and buying AMEX."
"$AXP, $COF, and $DFS are all winners. This dip will rebound to normal figures by Wed."
I think discover will be the credit card in the future. I am in college and almost everyone that has a credit card has a discover card.
This isn’t SQ it actually makes money and pays a nice dividend. Rotation is coming here this thing is going to 75 soon.
The number of common shares outstanding has gone from 544 million in May 2011 to 338 million in September 2018. Impressive!!!
DFS going to 65 - 70 short term.........don’t miss the boat.....
Their last earnings reports had a lot of strong guidance for this year sure enough turned out to be accurate. Surprises me how many people don't seem to have a clue about companies they invest in.. READ THE EARNINGS REPORT valuable information in their!
good buy no doubt. Balance Sheet is incredible. could be a buy of a lifetime right HERE
"I’m seeing more and more people posting that they are muting those such as #Simplicius, #DancingWithWolves and #DFS. Love reading that! For as long as I’ve been on this message board, I can assure you that the faster you mute those types of people the better off you’ll be. Happy Friday & let’s keep this steady XXII climb going."
Mastercard stock down $17 in last 5 days...get the picture yet...? credit card company's NOT the place to be...! and do NOT buy on the dip...its going to get worse....
mid 70s? nice
"Look at the past two months. This stock has gone up and down 30%+. I think it will rally today and then start to decline to the mid $30s. I have ridden the wave twice, unfortunately I got out too early on this past rally. Will buy again on the dip."
in long on DFS .. long calls as well as stock . 45$ calls may 01 are up 2800% unreal
talk about strength in a sea of red
Reasons to buy DFS:1. Valuation FWD EPS < 102. Growth of DFS and this industry3. Dividend over 2% and growing4. Share buyback program5. Potential for accelerated growth outside of the US.6. Quality products and services
Great company.
"I have been a customer since 1987 and this is why I bought their stock. Discover (DFS) walked away with top honors among credit card issuers, with a trust rating of 91.6. Based on participant responses, the survey identified the six most important trust attributes and weighted them by importance to compute the overall Trust Index. https://www.investors.com/news/most-trusted-credit-card-issuers/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo"
"CEO also bought but 5X more than CFO and Chief legal officer, I also think this is a good sign, LONG DFS"
I am desperately wanting to add more DFS shares into my portfolio. Do you guys think we might see lower levels?
This feels good
"30% profit margins 2% dividend with 20% payout ratio Huge margins and huge room for dividend growth and the company’s market cap is almost lower than the cash it holds, BULLISH"
y wud it sell 5% after awesome earnings ...profit taking maybe ?
"add here, may finish green"
DFS is basically a guaranteed double your money in 6 months buy. I wish it was always this easy
$2.59 per share - has a history of selling off on good earnings.solid quarter.Better look after conference call tomorrow.
"My 2 cents... DFS is Covid-19 proof in following1. No increase in operational expenses due social distancing or any other Covid-19 procedures2. Staff can work virtually 3. Changing habit of shopping physically to online may be a positive for the company as cash sales will be converted to credit or debit sales, so may be there is an increase in revenue"
"if stock drops after earnings, I will buy more on the dip, otherwise I'm holding"
great day trading stock at the moment. huge swings with this thing
"in 6 weeks reality will start to set in. at that time there will be more clarity on viability for those taking sba loans, and whether recessionary type numbers will be creeping into the next quarter. by mid july earning season will start giving us further color."
DFS a clear and consistent winner....I am a new and small time investor. I purchase 6 shares back in May for $38.19....wish I bought 600
"The best stock, so sad I sold it at $92."
Unreal. Got my 10 shares of core position started. Anybody got in at 23.57 just 2 months ago?
"Since the company acts as the bank for the credit card it is getting treated as a banking stock. That part is a little unfair as the fees on charging and the margin on the debt is much higher than that of most standard bank products. The second issue is the risk of percentage of receivables past due could spike. The last time that I mentioned this someone pointed out how low the delinquency rate this company has. The problem with that is that we have just come out of the high spending season for most cardholders and this is the time when the debt would be getting paid down. Instead large numbers of people have lost their income and many young people have lost their ability to continue paying their college debt. The ratio of delinquent and bad debt will absolutely rise, but so should charges by financially stable accounts as they use their card to ride out the current situation.As long as this lock down only lasts through June and the economy comes back to just 85% strength within a year this appears to be a cheap stock. That being said I am willing to wait a little longer hoping for more clarity on the economy and seeing if the stock retests it's lows. If I miss the very bottom and miss a little of the run I will be finw with that."
"Well this got a breakout above the 200dma. I’m gonna buy up some tomorrow morning. Promising stock movements, just look at the 5yr chart"
$TBT $C $JPM $GS $AXP $DFS keep an eye on treasury yields. Long end looks to rising while financial stocks diverge. Could make for a good entry.
CFO and EVP bought shares yesterday. A good sign moving forward.
