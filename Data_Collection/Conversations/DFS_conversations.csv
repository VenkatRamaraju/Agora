Why the dip on such good news?
Mastercard stock down $17 in last 5 days...get the picture yet...? credit card company's NOT the place to be...! and do NOT buy on the dip...its going to get worse....
I missed out in 2008 buying financial stocks and lost big opportunities. Not doing that again. Buying small amounts on every dip.
it seems that the announcemen of a quarterly dividend indicates management thinks future prospects look good.
Seaport Research Partners (whoever that is) starts with neutral rating
DFS a clear and consistent winner....I am a new and small time investor. I purchase 6 shares back in May for $38.19....wish I bought 600
"Oversold, back to $130 soon"
"Awesome!!!! Discover Financial Services EPS beats by $1.66, beats on revenue, announces buyback, raises dividend"
DFS is down 4.91% to 116.98
"Dear Valued Shareholders, Stakeholders, and Potential Investors, We are very excited to let you know we will be making a big announcement next week, which will accelerate the course of PHI Group and is expected to have a tremendous, long-lasting impact on our company’s future.BIG NEWS!!!!! Ticker(PHIL)"
"Next week, we will have another ""earnings beat."" This one could be a WHOPPER!"
Love discover glad I buy when it was in the mid 40s. I could only afford 20 shares but hey its something
I’m not stressed. Every stock I buy and trade I do so knowing full well the market could and should sell off at any moment. This is why dividends are important.
Want more...? VISA down $8... B of A down $2...Capital One down $11...CITI Down $3..Wells Fargo down $5 all in last 5 days...all credit card comp.
"Discover Financial Services today reported net income of $771 million or $2.45 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020, as compared to net income of $770 million or $2.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019.. Direct Banking pretax income of $917 million for the quarter was $26 million lower than pretax income for the prior year period..."
"If you look at the PE ratio, this stock is still at a great price to buy."
"Have had a Discover Card since 1985. I bought this stock last April $43, because of their great customer service. Should have bought it a long time ago!"
unemployment benefits ran out. people are going to stop paying bills
Pretty sleepy chat board for a stock that’s up 250% in the last 15 months
"With a PE of 8, beating the street, increased sales and revenues, $DFS is still a great buy and has tons of room to grow before catching up to $V, $MA, and $AXP. Could easily be a $300 stock today. With this small pull back, it's a great opportunity to get in."
Look at DFS rally!!! I expect DFS to smash their revenues and earnings today!!! GO DFS GO!!!
Beat Earnings and crashing?
"Since the company acts as the bank for the credit card it is getting treated as a banking stock. That part is a little unfair as the fees on charging and the margin on the debt is much higher than that of most standard bank products. The second issue is the risk of percentage of receivables past due could spike. The last time that I mentioned this someone pointed out how low the delinquency rate this company has. The problem with that is that we have just come out of the high spending season for most cardholders and this is the time when the debt would be getting paid down. Instead large numbers of people have lost their income and many young people have lost their ability to continue paying their college debt. The ratio of delinquent and bad debt will absolutely rise, but so should charges by financially stable accounts as they use their card to ride out the current situation.As long as this lock down only lasts through June and the economy comes back to just 85% strength within a year this appears to be a cheap stock. That being said I am willing to wait a little longer hoping for more clarity on the economy and seeing if the stock retests it's lows. If I miss the very bottom and miss a little of the run I will be finw with that."
Our EPS is more than DOUBLE our PE. How many stocks can show that?
"The last time DFS traded at this price was in June of 2012!Book value per share: $36.42Price per share: $37.12Cash per share: $22.46People are still using credit cards from home and DFS is pretty much an online business. In my subjective personal opinion, this stock is quite undervalued, given a long term perspective."
THANK YOU LORD FOR THE DEEP DISCOUNT TODAY FOR DISCOVER CARD BOUGHT IN BELOW $117 SEE U ALL AT $123 PER SHARE
"Long term investor, but first time posting. Considering a position in DFS since Visa is now +2% YTD and DFS is still -52% YTD and are both are heavily credit card based. DFS is stuck at around $41 which represents a ~46% drop from $75 (which was the price after previous earnings) which is also coincidentally equal to the revenue drop indicated at Google and Yahoo (shows 46% revenue drop for Q1). I looked into DFS most recent 10-Q and do not see a 46% drop in revenue as it was $2.398B (inline with previous year). I do think there's either an error or Google and Yahoo are reporting a post provision adjustment #. Either case, looks like DFS is getting over penalized."
"Hmm. Someone is making money. BRIEF-Discover Financial Services Reports Q3 EPS $3.54 (Oct. 20)BY Reuters— 7:53 AM ET 10/21/2021(Corrects EPS estimate at the time results were reported to $3.53, not $3.33, in third bullet) Discover Financial Services (DFS):"
"Discover Bank is a well run company and its balance sheet without a doubt is pristine. However I have traded in a couple of downturns (2000 & 2008) and with all sincerity and candor implore all longs to, at this time, stay off of margin. Full disclosure, I am bearish and in cash. I personally believe the SP500 is going to test 2,600 If you are in right now, I am not saying to sell. In fact if I were you at this point I would ride the storm out and collect your dividend, which is very safe. However if you are new to investing and wondering what a good entry point is, my take on the situation is that because of uncertainty of loan losses the financials won't bottom until July. I am not saying that DFS will lose money, what I am saying is that the market hates uncertainty. 2ndly: DFS interest spread is being hurt by the FED lowering rates to zero because, if you think about it banks will be lowering the prime rate which is what CC companies base their rates on. And 3rd: DFS will close out a fraction of their lines of credit, and when combined along with the charge offs they will probably have, DFS will take 2 or 3 years to build up their assets to what they were pre-covid. Which means it is going to take 3 years after the recession ends to start earning $9 bucks again. I am holding out till late June when it becomes readily apparent that many of the PPP eligible small companies wont be viable or be able to higher back everyone. Its at that time many mom and pop investors will grasp that financials are going to have a 3rd quarter with earnings worse than the 2nd quarter. IMHO if the SP500 does retest the 2,600 area, then DFS will be around its low of $25. And if the SP500 retests its March lows of 2200 then DFS will become a teenager. Once July earnings season gets here we will all know more. Good luck to all, both longs and shorts, it takes both of us to make a market here in the greatest country. Mr.schnieder"
what's the deal on the drop?
"Ah. Manipulation at it’s finest. All the payment companies have the same graph. Look at the options. The premium to sell puts is low but the premium to buy calls is high. No worries here. I’m long 1,000 shares since $28.15."
Why the big drop?
Look at the financials. DFS is a cash cow. One of my highest conviction holdings.
Great company.
"RSI of 28 --yea, this is WAY oversold."
this dog needs to be taken out and put down..downgraded to neutral..charge offs rising...out of 9 big bank analysts 1 is bullish 2 are somewhat bullish and 6 are indifferent on DFS...covid issues are maxing out credit cards and the coming mess is going to take this mutt back to 50's..you watch..!
"My suggestion to DFS to move higher quickly!- Create your own crypto coin. Call it the ""Discover Coin"" and begin using and accepting it around the world.- Announce you will buy 100,000 Teslas $TSLA and let customers go out shopping with them and use the Discover Coin- Announce that Discover Cards can be used as solar shingles to power your Tesla- Announce you are starting your own video streaming service and you won't make all the garbage that Netflix $NFLX and Amazon $AMZN are putting out. Not completely tulips but getting close.Now seriously what is wrong with people piling into stocks with bloated valuations or buying crypto when we all know they are just a legal pyramids (for now). All the while, the ones making money like DFS, Intel, GM etc are declining. I just wonder where this is all going? Are we headed for a major ""Tulip"" crash?"
why tho
Strong balance sheet and wonderful financials. Wish I owned more…on second thought I’m gonna buy another block
