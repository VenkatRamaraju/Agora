"$AXP, $COF, and $DFS are all winners. This dip will rebound to normal figures by Wed."
Eps beatrepurchase of shares...upward and onward from here.. proud be a part of Discover family
"People are ready to get out and charge. People live off of debt---this will not change anytime soon. Discover fell much further than Amex, Visa, MC....so the bounce will be better as can be seen with the bounce today. Either way, it is a buy for the long run. A year from now it is likely that this will have revisited the previous highs. The risk reward over a year to 2 years is very very positive"
Added good position yesterday so finger crossed  hopefully 15% upside today and more to come next week as US market is going open for business. Discover $ here.
Did they forget today was supposed to be ER day
Anyone thinking this will dip after drastically missing earnings?
"Discover Financial Services today reported net income of $771 million or $2.45 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020, as compared to net income of $770 million or $2.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019.. Direct Banking pretax income of $917 million for the quarter was $26 million lower than pretax income for the prior year period..."
"Discover Bank is a well run company and its balance sheet without a doubt is pristine. However I have traded in a couple of downturns (2000 & 2008) and with all sincerity and candor implore all longs to, at this time, stay off of margin. Full disclosure, I am bearish and in cash. I personally believe the SP500 is going to test 2,600 If you are in right now, I am not saying to sell. In fact if I were you at this point I would ride the storm out and collect your dividend, which is very safe. However if you are new to investing and wondering what a good entry point is, my take on the situation is that because of uncertainty of loan losses the financials won't bottom until July. I am not saying that DFS will lose money, what I am saying is that the market hates uncertainty. 2ndly: DFS interest spread is being hurt by the FED lowering rates to zero because, if you think about it banks will be lowering the prime rate which is what CC companies base their rates on. And 3rd: DFS will close out a fraction of their lines of credit, and when combined along with the charge offs they will probably have, DFS will take 2 or 3 years to build up their assets to what they were pre-covid. Which means it is going to take 3 years after the recession ends to start earning $9 bucks again. I am holding out till late June when it becomes readily apparent that many of the PPP eligible small companies wont be viable or be able to higher back everyone. Its at that time many mom and pop investors will grasp that financials are going to have a 3rd quarter with earnings worse than the 2nd quarter. IMHO if the SP500 does retest the 2,600 area, then DFS will be around its low of $25. And if the SP500 retests its March lows of 2200 then DFS will become a teenager. Once July earnings season gets here we will all know more. Good luck to all, both longs and shorts, it takes both of us to make a market here in the greatest country. Mr.schnieder"
This company is not going anywhere. I will keep adding on every drop. Will never get opportunity
Our EPS is more than DOUBLE our PE. How many stocks can show that?
This thing is getting ready to trade above $100. All that is needed is a couple of substantial up days in the overall market.
share buybacks and dividends alone make me confident in this one
Woohoo Got in at 27.62 in April - but only 100 shares
"Not bad - Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) today reported a net loss of $61 million or ($0.25) per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020, as compared to net income of $726 million or $2.15 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019."
"Curious, anyone have huge position in here? Either before or after the fall?"
talk about strength in a sea of red
Look at DFS rally!!! I expect DFS to smash their revenues and earnings today!!! GO DFS GO!!!
"The fact that this stock is not trading at over $60 just amazes me. They performed better than AXP in the FED's stress test, they are still paying the 0.44 dividend... Their balance sheet looks great, and they have the cash on hand to withstand defaults.. According to the FED they had enough cash on hand to be able to continue their dividends even if the unemployment rate was at 19% for an extended period of time. FOR SURE adding more..."
around $40 is probably our new low
lot of insiders are buying and hope you do the same. this is a no brainer - buy buy buy
wow.. great results.. net profit of 2.45 per share
"Cash per share a little over $22, market cap $25.25, book value in the $30's. Who here thinks this company will go bankrupt because of Covid19? I seriously doubt it, especially if they meet their impacted customers half way. I feel comfortable dollar cost averaging in small tranches for a good long while now to lower my cost basis."
"If you look at the PE ratio, this stock is still at a great price to buy."
"Next week, we will have another ""earnings beat."" This one could be a WHOPPER!"
Will people pay their bills? Doesn't discover take that risk on like a bank ?
"ooof , tough for sorts but longs that buy as things change will be rich. They're saying 1st/2nd quarter going to be rough but 3rd/4th rebound will be like nothing we've seen."
$60 stock soon then 80 again and then 100 in a year.
Bought DFS last year when it had fell to around $42/share. Have made a bunch of money on this great company! Thank you DFS!
"This definitely was one of my better moves, loaded up around $57 per share."
"Alex Alex , it may retest 37-38. patience my man. long term baby and just enjoy life"
I think discover will be the credit card in the future. I am in college and almost everyone that has a credit card has a discover card.
The weekly manipulation is here trying to drive down the price with asks spaced 0.03 apart all the way up to 41. trying to force this stock down so they can buy in low and explode the price. Buy in before it goes to the moon this week.
y wud it sell 5% after awesome earnings ...profit taking maybe ?
"My suggestion to DFS to move higher quickly!- Create your own crypto coin. Call it the ""Discover Coin"" and begin using and accepting it around the world.- Announce you will buy 100,000 Teslas $TSLA and let customers go out shopping with them and use the Discover Coin- Announce that Discover Cards can be used as solar shingles to power your Tesla- Announce you are starting your own video streaming service and you won't make all the garbage that Netflix $NFLX and Amazon $AMZN are putting out. Not completely tulips but getting close.Now seriously what is wrong with people piling into stocks with bloated valuations or buying crypto when we all know they are just a legal pyramids (for now). All the while, the ones making money like DFS, Intel, GM etc are declining. I just wonder where this is all going? Are we headed for a major ""Tulip"" crash?"
"Bought this Chrismas Eve, has been the most relaxing stock in my portfolio of 30 holdings."
All about a billion dollar reserve built which is reflected in earnings.This is not a total loss but an accounting change for potential writeoffs
"I've been building up a chunk of KHC down here too. Like the dividend, like the chart."
"Sold about 3/4 of my position. Hoping for a gap fill at around the 70 level. If it drops to 65, I’m doubling my original position. Solid long term hold, just hoping for a small consolation for technical’s sake. GLTA"
"Awesome!!!! Discover Financial Services EPS beats by $1.66, beats on revenue, announces buyback, raises dividend"
"Stock buy back, raised dividend, Then they cut interest pay out from 2.10% to 2.05% in the money market they offer. Did not see any head lines on this issue. Some one had to lose (the savers)"
"RSI of 28 --yea, this is WAY oversold."
Any idea why the significant price drop on DFS today?
Please increase the dividend. Give me a reason to hold forever.
"Oversold, back to $130 soon"
mid 70s? nice
Cheers everyone that bought in the last 2 months. This <50% gain feels real good
"The best stock, so sad I sold it at $92."
"DFS is cheap compared to V, MA, and AXP. Discover isn’t the leader or main innovator in credit cards but neither is AXP and they have twice the PE ratio"
"add here, may finish green"
"No surprise. Like all stocks, was already sold off huge in anticipation of losses. I bought at $33 recently and I will only add. It’ll be double in 4-8 months."
In at $30 during the height of the pandemic. Only wish I had bought more than 30 shares but all I could afford at the time. Can't complain about 300% profit though. Will hold on as long as I can
Unreal. Got my 10 shares of core position started. Anybody got in at 23.57 just 2 months ago?
"The last time DFS traded at this price was in June of 2012!Book value per share: $36.42Price per share: $37.12Cash per share: $22.46People are still using credit cards from home and DFS is pretty much an online business. In my subjective personal opinion, this stock is quite undervalued, given a long term perspective."
$2.59 per share - has a history of selling off on good earnings.solid quarter.Better look after conference call tomorrow.
The number of common shares outstanding has gone from 544 million in May 2011 to the current 306 million in the float. They should be looking at how quickly they can announce and begin an increased amount of buybacks at bargain prices. I love the yield from the growing dividend. Added more today.
"If you take a look at the 8-K DFS filed yesterday, they acknowledged owning over 26M shares of MQ currently valued at roughly $800M after MQ just went public. DFS will report this stake and its value as of 6/30 in its next earnings report. This will add roughly $2.60/share in additional EPS above and beyond what they are already doing in the business. That's going to be bullish for the share price."
THANK YOU LORD FOR THE DEEP DISCOUNT TODAY FOR DISCOVER CARD BOUGHT IN BELOW $117 SEE U ALL AT $123 PER SHARE
"Buying back $1.1B in shares, that’s great news."
"Down 10% due to missing revenue estimate by $10M -- extreme negative response, seems to me. Revenue up 5% to $2.94B missed expected $2.95B is a 0.3% miss. Looks like investors liked AMEX revenue growth of 9% perhaps selling DFS and buying AMEX."
"What is a reasonable price target for DFS, say by July 1, 2021 and Dec 31, 2021?"
good buy no doubt. Balance Sheet is incredible. could be a buy of a lifetime right HERE
I got in last May <$40 so I’m taking profits. I held on for the dividend but just too low now. I’ll hold a core position but shedded some now and looking for value elsewhere. Overall love DFS.
The number of common shares outstanding has gone from 544 million in May 2011 to 338 million in September 2018. Impressive!!!
Zacks gives it a stay away and the stock goes up 6 points
"Dear Valued Shareholders, Stakeholders, and Potential Investors, We are very excited to let you know we will be making a big announcement next week, which will accelerate the course of PHI Group and is expected to have a tremendous, long-lasting impact on our company’s future.BIG NEWS!!!!! Ticker(PHIL)"
This price point hasn't been seen since 2012 and is a steal in my opinion. Hopefully we'll see $50 in nine days.
Pretty sleepy chat board for a stock that’s up 250% in the last 15 months
Mastercard stock down $17 in last 5 days...get the picture yet...? credit card company's NOT the place to be...! and do NOT buy on the dip...its going to get worse....
What’s taking so long lol
I’m ready to get more. This is so easy. LOAD UP. Great dividend and growth.
Anyone see 10% profit today when small business application loan hets approved - $DFS
"I suppose we'll get more clarity on the 22nd, but I like that DFS revenue is the same as last year, unlike WFC which is down around 4 Bil year over year. DFS was a money printing machine before covid. Yes, it is lamer than MA and V, but how this isn't the best bang for your buck blows my mind. The question I have for DFS and the banks: Are the loan loss provisions actually losses? they are posted as expenses, but is money actually going out the door? If not, these stocks will be sandbagged for a big boom if layoffs and the economy don't turn out as bad as expected this fall. WFC predicts heavy unemployment and they are accounting for it, taking a big hit to the dividend and the stock. I own DFS probably because i'm in love with it, lol, but I'm keeping wfc on the watch list. WFC was a dominant bank not to long ago, but in the last few years has definitely created problems for itself."
Discover Financial reached a 52 Week high at 94.00
$TBT $C $JPM $GS $AXP $DFS keep an eye on treasury yields. Long end looks to rising while financial stocks diverge. Could make for a good entry.
The concern is credit default. JPM took out nearly $6b in reserves to account for loan losses. However they also had a great quarter for credit account openings.
Bought 1200 shares today
I have 65 shares in IRA what would be an entry point for a pullback. I would like to buy 10-20 more shares. Who old 110-116 be a good place to pick up more? Thanks everyone.
"When every company cuts its divid, DFS will pay div which tell us they are so strong, and investors like that so this is going up even q2 will be bad"
"According to Discover’s history, it has paid 0.44 per quarter for the last 4 quarter showing how it most likely is set for a dividend increase. But with the new article, the fed is telling big banks to retain the same dividend and not increase to save capital. Anyone know if DFS will be following the big banks and will not be aloud to increase even though they can?"
This isn’t SQ it actually makes money and pays a nice dividend. Rotation is coming here this thing is going to 75 soon.
"With a PE of 8, beating the street, increased sales and revenues, $DFS is still a great buy and has tons of room to grow before catching up to $V, $MA, and $AXP. Could easily be a $300 stock today. With this small pull back, it's a great opportunity to get in."
I have a student loan and a credit card with discover. Customer service is awesome and everything is so simple and easy.
"Since the company acts as the bank for the credit card it is getting treated as a banking stock. That part is a little unfair as the fees on charging and the margin on the debt is much higher than that of most standard bank products. The second issue is the risk of percentage of receivables past due could spike. The last time that I mentioned this someone pointed out how low the delinquency rate this company has. The problem with that is that we have just come out of the high spending season for most cardholders and this is the time when the debt would be getting paid down. Instead large numbers of people have lost their income and many young people have lost their ability to continue paying their college debt. The ratio of delinquent and bad debt will absolutely rise, but so should charges by financially stable accounts as they use their card to ride out the current situation.As long as this lock down only lasts through June and the economy comes back to just 85% strength within a year this appears to be a cheap stock. That being said I am willing to wait a little longer hoping for more clarity on the economy and seeing if the stock retests it's lows. If I miss the very bottom and miss a little of the run I will be finw with that."
Backing up the truck on this one today great buy!!
Great company.
DFS had a fantastic quarter. Hard to believe it's not up big this morning. You just never know with earnings releases. I own DFS and Visa and DFS is a much better value (single digit forward PE) and is crushing it.
"I'm so hyped I got in at $34. This is a diamond in the rough. How can this company be worth 2012 prices. They have beefed up loss reserves, and prepped for this downturn for years. Do not miss this under $40; this is not a cruise line or airline."
really good to company to hold long term for 2x.
Why the big drop?
what's the deal on the drop?
I think its time to buy DFS.Strong company at a big discount. Buy a dollar for .75 cents!
"got in today, the first time in the market in approximately 5 or 6 years or so. I am very happy with getting a 5% dividend that I personally am confident of keeping for additional income for years to come. I still have 10% in cash to deploy when we see the employment numbers normalize down the road."
"Have had a Discover Card since 1985. I bought this stock last April $43, because of their great customer service. Should have bought it a long time ago!"
Strong balance sheet and wonderful financials. Wish I owned more…on second thought I’m gonna buy another block
"On the news that HSBC is going buy one credit card company in US, DFS or SYF?"
Time to buy bank more - Thank you fed $BAC $JPM $AXP $C $DFS - gold mine
Obvious profit taking from funds buying at lows this week. Unless I'm missing something on their earnings and outlook I have to believe that we may get upgrades soon and the stock rebound. This market is so manipulated so who knows!
The only positive i see today is the percentage fall is on par with the blue chips and not 15% like in the past few weeks..
Want more...? VISA down $8... B of A down $2...Capital One down $11...CITI Down $3..Wells Fargo down $5 all in last 5 days...all credit card comp.
"If you back out the reserve release, the Q2 earnings were around $4.50/share, or $18/share annualized, meaning DFS still only trades at a P/E of around 7."
unemployment benefits ran out. people are going to stop paying bills
New to trading. DFS is one of my first investments. Invested a week ago at about 35.20 a share. Guessing hold? Probably going to dip and then come back up considering well below for earnings? Would love to hear thoughts/suggestions.
if crosses 84 than 94 is the new stop.. just stay strong.. 5x multipliers in upcoming years.
One of my better one day trades... I’m excited for the long term
"30% profit margins 2% dividend with 20% payout ratio Huge margins and huge room for dividend growth and the company’s market cap is almost lower than the cash it holds, BULLISH"
"Bought in today before earnings. Should have bought a while ago. Worried this is another case of buy the rumor, sell the news."
25 % upside in 6 to 12 months......collect that nice dividend and enjoy !
Morgan Stanley price target on DFS is $90 share! Great earning today!
No new threads... no one is interested in such a valued investment. currently at 57.08 on 9/28. Look back after December 2020 and see what you have missed.
"Apr. 23, 2020 8:00 AM ETQ1 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call"
Thanks to the sellers Thurs am who thought earnings were bad. That's called acctg 101Will be a bumpy next few months but this is a long term no brainer as we re-open the USI appreciate the added shares I bought that are up over 10% sinceKeep hoping for a better entry price
Look at the financials. DFS is a cash cow. One of my highest conviction holdings.
it seems that the announcemen of a quarterly dividend indicates management thinks future prospects look good.
"Discover Financial Services EPS beats by $0.24, revenue in-line"
DFS and AXP holding strong.. love those two. MA and V are over priced imo.
I’m up 202% in one year...very happy. Where does this go from here? I think I will stick around for the upcoming dividend increases....
No surprise. The the world is in shutdown.. stock already lost almost 60% if it goes down great buy
"Ah. Manipulation at it’s finest. All the payment companies have the same graph. Look at the options. The premium to sell puts is low but the premium to buy calls is high. No worries here. I’m long 1,000 shares since $28.15."
I missed out in 2008 buying financial stocks and lost big opportunities. Not doing that again. Buying small amounts on every dip.
Love discover glad I buy when it was in the mid 40s. I could only afford 20 shares but hey its something
What's not to like about those numbers? IT card appears to be bringing in new business.
Why the dip on such good news?
Why so red today

"I’m seeing more and more people posting that they are muting those such as #Simplicius, #DancingWithWolves and #DFS. Love reading that! For as long as I’ve been on this message board, I can assure you that the faster you mute those types of people the better off you’ll be. Happy Friday & let’s keep this steady XXII climb going."
23 Billion in liquidity and 40 Billion in credit line10 Billion mkt capThis is a coiled spring on recovery and an investor sees it and a trader is just that
"Long term investor, but first time posting. Considering a position in DFS since Visa is now +2% YTD and DFS is still -52% YTD and are both are heavily credit card based. DFS is stuck at around $41 which represents a ~46% drop from $75 (which was the price after previous earnings) which is also coincidentally equal to the revenue drop indicated at Google and Yahoo (shows 46% revenue drop for Q1). I looked into DFS most recent 10-Q and do not see a 46% drop in revenue as it was $2.398B (inline with previous year). I do think there's either an error or Google and Yahoo are reporting a post provision adjustment #. Either case, looks like DFS is getting over penalized."
great day trading stock at the moment. huge swings with this thing
"I’m this has been one of my best performers, why is Morningstar bearish in it?"
"if stock drops after earnings, I will buy more on the dip, otherwise I'm holding"
"Look at the past two months. This stock has gone up and down 30%+. I think it will rally today and then start to decline to the mid $30s. I have ridden the wave twice, unfortunately I got out too early on this past rally. Will buy again on the dip."
"Great stuff, already plus 10 points off my jan 27 add. happy i had the chance, Onwards!"
$49.37 Average cost per share... Only problem with the massive gains is that now DFS is such a large part of my portfolio. It still sort of looks like a buy too..... should I sell any before next earnings or just hold this thing forever?
I got in around 57 per share. Definitely one of my better moves. Anyone getting in now on this current dip I think should do ok
"With a PE of 29 and market cap of $29B, DFS has a ton more room to grow. It's very cheap."
CFO and EVP bought shares yesterday. A good sign moving forward.
their balance sheet is excellent. I feel safe with this one long term
Lots of strength around 37.20 & 40. Looking good for daily gain.
why tho
"Okay, so a good buy would be 22 an even better buy is at 1, realistically I think that getting in at anything under 29.99 is a great play. Long term spending will come back quickly and strong, looking for 100 in 5 years. I am long and I’m looking to lower my cost basis. The cheaper the better."
Either the company goes bankrupt or you make money buying the stock.
Undervalued
this dog needs to be taken out and put down..downgraded to neutral..charge offs rising...out of 9 big bank analysts 1 is bullish 2 are somewhat bullish and 6 are indifferent on DFS...covid issues are maxing out credit cards and the coming mess is going to take this mutt back to 50's..you watch..!
the ceo said that the company is well positioned for 2021 so the outlook is good probably just profit taking
This is AWESOME. I'm so committed to DFS that I really don't even look at it - I know it's a long winner. Pleasantly caught off guard by the jump though.
I tried to warn you. $22
DFS a clear and consistent winner....I am a new and small time investor. I purchase 6 shares back in May for $38.19....wish I bought 600
DFS going to 65 - 70 short term.........don’t miss the boat.....
Seaport Research Partners (whoever that is) starts with neutral rating
This feels good
I’m not stressed. Every stock I buy and trade I do so knowing full well the market could and should sell off at any moment. This is why dividends are important.
DFS is down 4.91% to 116.98
I am expecting this great company's shares to trade between $103- $107 per share by the end of April.
just picked up 100 shares of DFS to get started. lots of room left more than V
Reasons to buy DFS:1. Valuation FWD EPS < 102. Growth of DFS and this industry3. Dividend over 2% and growing4. Share buyback program5. Potential for accelerated growth outside of the US.6. Quality products and services
this is a very well run company and I have been a user of their products and services for over 20yrs with zero complaints. I am confident the stock price will rebound. #Long
Beat Earnings and crashing?
"My 2 cents... DFS is Covid-19 proof in following1. No increase in operational expenses due social distancing or any other Covid-19 procedures2. Staff can work virtually 3. Changing habit of shopping physically to online may be a positive for the company as cash sales will be converted to credit or debit sales, so may be there is an increase in revenue"
"Hmm. Someone is making money. BRIEF-Discover Financial Services Reports Q3 EPS $3.54 (Oct. 20)BY Reuters— 7:53 AM ET 10/21/2021(Corrects EPS estimate at the time results were reported to $3.53, not $3.33, in third bullet) Discover Financial Services (DFS):"
Any estimates as to how much Discover will increase their dividend? I say at least 6 cents per share on a quarterly basis.
