"My experience with Potbelly - I don't own the shares. I was at Tampa Airport last Friday, thought I trying a PB sandwich, but it was Horrible to eat and it was so pricey too. And now I fell sick, I don't know the Viral Fever caused by this Sandwich / sort of food contamination.It is a horrible experience, next to it was Panda Express and other nice Restaurents, would have been a better choice.I promise never to visit that place or any Potbelly joint again.GL!"

"I'm lucky I sold out. at $10 a a share 4 years ago thinking it be the next Chiptole. They have a great product. I don't think it was a bad thing they took PPP money, they'll go bankrupt without it and probably could've had a chance to turn around with it. Too bad because a lot of jobs will be lost especially in Chicago."

"Q2 same store sales down 4%, inclusive of a 2% per order increase? 2Q Marketing spend and costs all up. Q1 sales decrease blamed on weather and government shutdown. No explanation provided for 2Q continued underperformance and reduced EBITDA. Why the continued momentum in losing market share from the turnaround specialists? Board has to worry about their fiduciary duty to this company if this team does not meet its own Q3 EBITDA target."

"I have been following this for a while and wanted to find a compelling reason to buy due to the price decline, however, after some research..-Losing streak for multiple years-Even lost $ LY in awesome economy-Their numbers are rebounding like other restaurants but if couldn't make $ LY???-Renegotiated most of their leases (10Q said these were inconsequential - likely deferments, not concessions)-Getting kicked out of Company HQ (owe landlord $900k)-Lost their new VP of franchises after 1 year (he bailed to a competitor)-CEO was given the boot, new CEO was unemployed so it is not like he was wooed away (good experience though...)-Legal council/head of HR is leaving after 14 years-Rumors of layoffs coming-Rumors of closing 100 locations down to 30 (a positive)-Bank line of credit renegotiated 3x recently and was cut from $40M to $30M (they opened another for $10 due to PPP loan for $10)I used to be a retail analyst and the overhead of the lease payments is what is going to kill them. The snowball is rolling downhill. I would recommend to longs that you take advantage of this surge and get out. Be thankful you are not a commercial landlord and seeing your fortune revalued by CV19 and the internet.BTW, their RSI is high, indicating the stock should trade lower soon.Best of luck to all."

"Not sure what bulls see in this company. Strong competition for quality and price everywhere. Chicagos' Lincoln Square location is empty Fridays and Saturdays. Maybe there was a lunch rush but we have saturated food choices. Jimmy Johns, Subway, Taco in a bag, Chubby Weiners, Costellos (closed recently) and others. Company still losing money, right?"

"Hand out PB cookies in front of stores with an offer inside for a free in store pick up of another cookie when they register and order online. If someone walks by the store regularly, they should be encouraged to pop inside for a sandwich pick up. The menu is fine, people stopped coming in when the ongoing menu changes slowed up the lines. Gotta get them back in (and out quicker). Think Starbucks!."

JAMES' Junk Stock is $13.32 up 2.5% today. Just my ignirant personal opinion...I think it a bit too early here to see 14s but what do I know? I see the stock as perfectly valued fine in low to mid 13s and overextended much beyond that until we get another earnings report or 2 in the books showing more improvements made on the balance sheet. Perfectly happy either way as a long.
