"Seems weird the day potbelly has news about new executive,they get some 12 year old to do a YouTube video on how potbelly is high on the bankruptcy list singling them out three times,sad"
I passed two Potbellys in Chicago. Empty parking lot and deserted srores. Warning since $22/ share. Avoid.
Is there a bad print? $3.10 new low today...need to check time and sales.
PBPB is up 5.46% to 12.55
JAMES' Junk Stock is $13.32 up 2.5% today. Just my ignirant personal opinion...I think it a bit too early here to see 14s but what do I know? I see the stock as perfectly valued fine in low to mid 13s and overextended much beyond that until we get another earnings report or 2 in the books showing more improvements made on the balance sheet. Perfectly happy either way as a long.
Jersey Mike's is eating Potbelly's lunch.
6 month chart PBPB is higher.Year to date chart PBPB is higher.1 year chart... PBPB is higher.S&P 500 today up .58%You know the drill... PBPB is higher up 1.39%
Trying to understand the negative reaction to the appointment of the new CFO. Anyone with any insight?
"On no, new low."
little nervous with pbpb... own at $2.78..
"PBPB has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. check out https://pennystockplatform.blogspot.com/, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
PBPB is going down soon. Look at their sales!
"Potbelly has experienced higher lows on dips if you go back to late April to present. With the 52 week high recently the stock has a 6 month+ higher low higher highs chart which is long term bullish. Unless earnings surprises to the downside, Potbelly is flashing long term bullish signals here."
"I'm lucky I sold out. at $10 a a share 4 years ago thinking it be the next Chiptole. They have a great product. I don't think it was a bad thing they took PPP money, they'll go bankrupt without it and probably could've had a chance to turn around with it. Too bad because a lot of jobs will be lost especially in Chicago."
what happened to this company?
PBPB is up 6.01% to 12.35
"too much competition and sandwich boutiques. They are a fabulous place to eat as is Subway, SCHlotzskys and jersey mikes and so many other places"
any reason PBPB doesnt rally like every other food/restaurant stocks?
"Yes, baby! YES BABY! We're back! The ""on-going concern"" warning has been removed. Look at that growth, even with covid-19! This should be trading MUCH higher!"
make sure I understand what's going on here the stock seems to be bit up heavily in the pre-market only two he stopped midday
KaChing folks
"Hand out PB cookies in front of stores with an offer inside for a free in store pick up of another cookie when they register and order online. If someone walks by the store regularly, they should be encouraged to pop inside for a sandwich pick up. The menu is fine, people stopped coming in when the ongoing menu changes slowed up the lines. Gotta get them back in (and out quicker). Think Starbucks!."
Potbelly is up 9.69% to 8.49
"Anyone who knows good sandwiches would NEVER enter a Subway, but if they can prosper then surely PBPB can recover. BTW, the new menu combinations are excellent. But, they sure did blame everything up to an including global warming for their recent earnings miss. Good grief..."
"I have been following this for a while and wanted to find a compelling reason to buy due to the price decline, however, after some research..-Losing streak for multiple years-Even lost $ LY in awesome economy-Their numbers are rebounding like other restaurants but if couldn't make $ LY???-Renegotiated most of their leases (10Q said these were inconsequential - likely deferments, not concessions)-Getting kicked out of Company HQ (owe landlord $900k)-Lost their new VP of franchises after 1 year (he bailed to a competitor)-CEO was given the boot, new CEO was unemployed so it is not like he was wooed away (good experience though...)-Legal council/head of HR is leaving after 14 years-Rumors of layoffs coming-Rumors of closing 100 locations down to 30 (a positive)-Bank line of credit renegotiated 3x recently and was cut from $40M to $30M (they opened another for $10 due to PPP loan for $10)I used to be a retail analyst and the overhead of the lease payments is what is going to kill them. The snowball is rolling downhill. I would recommend to longs that you take advantage of this surge and get out. Be thankful you are not a commercial landlord and seeing your fortune revalued by CV19 and the internet.BTW, their RSI is high, indicating the stock should trade lower soon.Best of luck to all."
"I am out.. bought at $2.75.... $5,46 aft hrs"
Timberrrrrrrrrrrr
Anyone done profitability by restaurant analysis for PBPB? Curious how profitability by restaurant changes among different vintages (i.e. profitability of new restaurants opened in 2014 vs. those newly opened in 2017)?
"Taking the PPP money will be bad for their image. They should have tapped private equity markets instead of taking money meant for main street. Average loan was $50k, so they took 200 companies worth. PR disaster for them."

This will be the next Pump stock. Wsb called it
After a solid gain yesterday Potbelly up .58% so far a solid beat of the S&P 500 index.
"Competition is fierce in the Chicago market. Jersey Mikes is garnering a corner on sub market. $pbpb Going concern maybe, but not really a growing concern."
Big news Wendyâ€™s exec is coming on board Hopeful he can grow a great product
"Not sure what bulls see in this company. Strong competition for quality and price everywhere. Chicagos' Lincoln Square location is empty Fridays and Saturdays. Maybe there was a lunch rush but we have saturated food choices. Jimmy Johns, Subway, Taco in a bag, Chubby Weiners, Costellos (closed recently) and others. Company still losing money, right?"
"They have a wonderful product but corporate does not know how to run/support the stores. Very little guidance and quality is not the same from store to store.,"
"Q2 same store sales down 4%, inclusive of a 2% per order increase? 2Q Marketing spend and costs all up. Q1 sales decrease blamed on weather and government shutdown. No explanation provided for 2Q continued underperformance and reduced EBITDA. Why the continued momentum in losing market share from the turnaround specialists? Board has to worry about their fiduciary duty to this company if this team does not meet its own Q3 EBITDA target."
"Pizza companies have thrived during this pandemic. I feel like a nimble, low overhead business like a sandwich shop should do the same. Anyone know why it's not recovering?"
James' junk stock is up 6.27 percentile.
