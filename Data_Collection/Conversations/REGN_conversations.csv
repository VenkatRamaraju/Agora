"Sams, I've been in this company for close to twenty years and done very well but it is completely manipulated. I always say to myself to sell half my position when we get these amazing runs upward because institutions just sell it in waves. I cannot believe how much they act in concert with one another. Still, over the long haul, regn rises. But it is definitely manipulated and I think more than most."

"#6 From the COVID Plan:Getting Life-Saving Monoclonal Antibody Treatment to Those Who Need ItThe United States government shipped an average of approximately 100,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies per week across July and August. The Administration will increase the average weekly pace of shipments of free monoclonal antibody treatment to states by a further 50% in September, continuing to accelerate the federal government’s efforts to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 treatment. Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. As hospital systems experience increased COVID-19 cases, many have identified monoclonal antibody treatment as a key tool to improve health outcomes, prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on overburdened hospitals."
Regeneron owns the exclusive rights to Intellia's CRISPR technology for liver therapies and currently has over 20 preclinical programs that are being evaluated for further research. Specifically look at their siRNA drugs. When people talk about Regeneron's pipeline they need to factor in these partnerships. They aren't just a monoclonal antibodies company or an oncology company. Covid forced them to delay pipeline advancement
"The WSJ indicated there are currently 150,000 cocktails being administered every week right now. Doesn't that give REGN a monthly cocktail run rate of $5B? I based that on $2,500 per infusion.REGN wasn't doing $9B a year in revenue prior to CV."
wait for 500- something....see this movie before.

Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison maintains Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) with a Equal-Weight and raises the price target from $576 to $606.
A stock split might send a signal of management confidence and boost the PE.
$REGN is there to stay for the long term!https://youtu.be/Dj8cjp95G3Q
It can't go higher until moderna stops tanking. regn is bundled into too many similar funds with it
It's getting close to its pre covid price before emergency use treatment was anticipated. i don't see how you can make a convincing argument it has the same value before it sold a dollar worth of covid monoclonal antibodies than after it sold multiple billions worth of it and will likely still see a billion in annual revenue from it.
"Just provided an update on Regeneron, the largest position in my million dollars portfolio. Let me know what you think. I'm here for the long term, really like the company (NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE).https://youtu.be/sqxqNM5ijRY"
Regeneron has 9 major drugs in phase 3 trials. Phase 3 drugs are passed 68 % of the time. Some of these trials are in the later stage. You have all these revenue generations about to enter the market while the ones active now are finding off label uses. Cancer drugs are hard to get to phase 3 and are very lucrative once they enter legal use status

Waiting for the government to order more COVID-19 antibody cocktails! REGN has much more upside left.
I saw Ron Desantis on news last night saying Florida is now buying GlaxoSmith Klein (GSK) cocktail as they can’t get enough of REGN cocktail. Sounds like good news for REGN if they are selling everything they can make and it’s still not enough
"If you don’t think a stock will produce above-market returns over the next twelve months, you shouldn’t buy it. If you think it will outperform the market, buy it and hold it. If your investment horizon is shorter than twelve months, you will most likely miss out on part of the returns of a stock in an uptrend, or realize part of the decline of a stock in a downtrend. Focusing on a twelve-month horizon will most likely be more profitable, as well as less stressful."
REGN being painted with the COVID brush. But the company’s core business and source of growth is unrelated to COVID. Buying opportunity.
"I remember several months back news that Regeneron was quite far along in making their therapy available in pill form. After that, I didn't see any more about it. Does anyone have any information? If it's going to happen, let's have some news."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now .

"Thanks to Regeneron executives for deciding to sell 1.4 million initial doses of monoclonal antibody treatments to the Federal dept of health and human services. An executive at Regeneron stated ""deliveries"" will start in Sept this year (now). That means that available doses are off the hospital/clinic shelves and en route to a HHS storage facility. In my state there was an article yesterday ""regeneron"" in limited supply at hospitals throughout the state. Thanks Regeneron for taking a large percentage of your production volume away from the states now when the public needs it the most. What does it say about china joe's care for the public that his cronies have been ordered to ""take inventory"" in govt storage of the most effective medicinal therapeutic for covid? Ever heard the term population reduction?"
"I started a position back in March when there were so many bashers here but look at how well it has done since then. If it goes down more, I would be happy to double down."

The 2 billion is gross revenue. Expensive to maniufacture .Bottom line effect not as great as you may think. This is close to 600 stock without covid based on 15 pe and 40 in earnings per share expected without covid. With is now edtimstes at 61 at 11pe . With continuing growrh on Dupixent and libayto this will be worth at least 650 in 2022. Buy the dips this stock always overcorrects on competition news
What was that last minute dip?
"Told you couple of weeks ago, big news coming this month. 3 billion contract. Expect the price back up to $700."
At least it didn't fall as much as the Nasdaq which I guess is something.
Gov abbott just tested positive and is getting REGN antibodies even though he has no symptoms.
Momentum indicators bottomed and turning up. Gap between 578 and 605 should get filled.

Once again positive news comes out and the stock sells off. At least it's consistent.

Extremely uncharacteristic reversal to the upside today which suggests staying power at these levels. But as always with this stock - we'll see.
How about another 5% drop today?
Ron DeSantis press conference at Bonita Springs: 21 REGN centers in Florida each capable of 300 treatments per day (twice as many in Broward County) with Texas likely to set up clinics soon and northern states likely to follow for the fall and winter.
"All an investor has to do is study the ""Financials"" of this company. One does not need a biochem or med or science degree to forsee where this company is headed!"
I'm sure there's some algorithm out there that has a buy trigger once it hits a certain level. The big question is what is that price?
"The “MOVe-IN” trial used this drug in patients who were in hospital with COVID-19 and was stopped in April 2021 because of insufficient clinical benefit. The only treatment for those who have not bult enough antibodies is Regenereon cocktail. Those cases are enough to sell all the doses they can prduce in years to come. People just don't get tested for covid when they get cold. When they are hospitalized the cold happens to be Covid, but it is too late for the Merck's drug even if it get approved some day."
REGN is down because of an experimental pill? Are you kidding me??? Who cares. This is not a Covid play. In any case it hurts to see the stock being down but I invest long term. Thank you for 300 shares.
"like a clockwork, short at open guys..."
Clearly REGN cocktail is superior to any other treatment on the market.
"On a positive note, the EU will likely approve Ronapreve (REGEN-COV) in a few weeks. It will be only the second Covid medicine given full approval in the EU. The other is remdesivir"
"Massive cup is full. Beginning at last summers share price high of 664. Now the handle is forming. Eventually, a big price gain with big volume with be the start of a nice run."
molnupiravir is half the price of monoclonal antibodies and it doesn't involve a needle. This is the first wave of antiviral pill treatments. REGN is not a covid stock. If you bought it because you want a covid play then sell imo. Thing is the antiviral pills are just one of many new covid treatment options coming up. Prior to covid REGN was a $500 stock. Covid gave them many many billions of dollars. If you believe REGN can use that money practically to make new drugs and increase stock holder value in the future then hold
Look for a 4:1 split and stock repurchase announced Monday
I just got here but I question my decision 5 times a day. It''s done nothing but go down since i bought it. Did I missing something? I didn't even factor the covid profits into my buy decision. Nobody i speak to in actual life sounded enthusiastic about the stock. i was told to look at what i'm buying two years down the road. I looked and i see a slew of new drugs and in use drugs with new off label uses. i see lucrative partnerships and a ton of money to make new drugs possible. am i wrong? Did i make a mistake on this one?
Is this dropping due to potential pharmaceutical price control legislation in congress?
WHO recommends monoclonal antibody cocktail that REGN supplies and stock drops $7.5. Go figureSelling at a 12 PE with minimal debt. Good pipeline too. Go figure.
"Let's put this in perspective, the company just sold 3 billion in drugs to the gov, and it only sold 8.7 billion last year."
"Today got some of the COVID story out of the stock. REGN’s fortunes depend on its other therapies. REGEN-COV, while adding volatility, is icing on the cake."
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
Any idea on why this closed near the day's low?
"REGN is getting hammered today because in my opinion the administration is going ""all in"" on thevaccination route. Early treatment when one is symptomatic, with REGN's monoclonal antibody cocktailis getting pushed aside."
What about Global demand for Reg-Cov. How will that play out?

"For what it's worth, it did bounce off the 542 support level. Next move back up would be around the 575 - if you're a chartist."
Screaming buy!!!
"New all-time high (674.07) and closing high (663.27). That should bring in buy orders, but selling in last ten minutes today may signal that we have some supply to get through before the stock breaks out. Price should hold here. Then continuation of the uptrend. $900 within 12 months."
Shorts- get out before the earnings call. Don't look where REGN stands in ARKG's holdings. ARKG's core holding has been TDOC all year and its share price has been cut in half.
"Regeneron’s price action is getting a bit wild up here around $665. Long candlesticks with buying pressure one day and selling pressure the next. Friday’s intraday high was $673, but dipped at close? *Question to the biotech folks on this quiet MB. Has there been any clinical trials for children under 12 years of age with the REGEN-COV cocktail?. There are several states with school districts that are very high in positivity tests for COVID-19. The Delta variant will only become more prevalent as Fall season arrives. So, if no vaccines are approved for children 12 years of age and younger, what about the cocktail being approved as a substitute for now? Anyone?"
There is always seems to be short term downward pressure on this stock with investors looking for a reason to sell rather than looking at the long term outlook that would clearly indicate a buy. It almost suggests buying and putting it in a draw rather than looking at the daily/weekly/monthly moves.
The Cocktail will be taken by vaccinated and non vaccinated alike. People get scared when they test positive and the Texas Governor showed that much. He was vaccinated and still took the cocktail just to make sure.This is the only treatment available that keeps people out of the hospital so they will sell them like candies all around the World.
Lol...its just 2% drop. Relax.
The price held up better than I thought it would. That's the most positive dynamic of today's trading. There's more than enough demand lately to offset whatever fund has been exiting its position in the past couple of weeks
when i see a nice BIG green candle im in. for now ill just wait to see how deep its falling to get the best price
Ouch.. all healthcare slammed today.. cheapest sector with huge growth
"word is getting out, monoclonal antibodies are the way to treat covid. vaccines just don't seem to beeffectrive long term. REGN at PE of 12, minimal debt. could be a double from here. Just my opinions."
"Judging Regeneron's revenue, profits and future based on Covid is like valuing McDonald's based on their McRib sandwich sales. People are completely missing the boat with this company. Cutting edge research and unparalleled pipeline."
"In addition to Molnupiravir potentially being teratogenic (and even perhaps carcinogenic--no one knows), two late stage studies from India on the effectiveness of the drug in ""moderate' Covid have now been terminated because of lack of effect. It is remarkable how a non-peer reviewed company sponsored small study has altered the perception of Regeneron's antibodies as a life saver."
"RSI shows oversold, add positions at around $550 for long term. Will positions to no more than 3% of the total portfolio."
"Regeneron price target raised to $727 from $636 at Benchmark 06:27 REGN Benchmark analyst Aydin Huseynov raised the firm's price target on Regeneron to $727 from $636 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The increased price target reflects a number of upcoming catalysts for Regeneron, including accelerated utilization rates for REGEN-COV, highly anticipated new government contracts, increasing number of breakthrough infections, EUAs for pre-exposure and inpatient use, and increasing global demand for Ronapreve, Huseynov tells investors in a research note."
Nobody just nobody can explain why REGN has such a low P/E.
Merck's Molnupiravir antiviral Covid-19 drug trials are going to be stopped for moderate Covid cases in India for lack of efficacy. The trials there for mild cases are ongoing.
"Rather than treat this stock with complete and total respect, which it deserves based on all its matrix including incredible growth, as crazy as it sounds, it's almost treated like a meme stock. It's ponderous."
Trading at 12.9-times forward earnings with 40%+ net profit margin (without REGEN-COV) and $1.2B more cash than debt.
"The weight of $REGN and $MRNA in $IBB brought down entire biotech sector. The market is sometimes irrational. Vaccines and antibodies are needed for years, even if Merck's pill reduces the hospitalization by a half."
"Remover this from pleith not long ago from esmo:Why $MRK Keynote-826 data spell terrible news for $AGEN. Via @evaluatevantage #ESMO21He just tweeted this follow up:$SNY $REGN Libtayo gets 30 Jan 2022 Pdufa date for 2nd-line cervical cancer. Highly relevant to $AGEN (16 Dec 2021 Pdufa date), in addition to the reasons above $MRK"
"Regeneron still the cheaper and more effective early treatment, and prophylactic. Merck ($MRK) 5 day treatment $700 x 5 = $3500."
Libtayo's lung cancer phase 3 trials surpassed expectations. Unlike Keytruda it works in squamous cell lung cancer and survival rate was longer.
I think the cat may finally be out of the bag (in a good way). Regeneron has become a staple during Covid antibody therapies discussions almost daily - especially on CNBC.
"What the heck, a $34 a share drop in value because of an “Ivermectin pill” that Merck received FDA approval on? So, when Pfizer’s pill (same medicine) gets FDA very soon, do we (REGN) drop another -5%? “Not Happy at All”, ."
"Molnupiravir was initially developed as an oral antiviral drug for use in influenza. Those clinical trials were never completed. Tamiflu, a drug that has similar action in that it introduces copying errors during viral RNA replication, now is available in generic form at an uninsured cost of about 100 dollars for a treatment course. Tamiflu must be taken early in the course of the disease (influenza) and decreases the duration of infection by about 40%. The CDC still pushes the flu vaccine despite the availability and low cost of TamifluMolnupiravir was studied in less than 800 patients and the results have not been peer-reviewed. There was just under a 50% reduction in deaths and hospitalizations when given early in the course of the disease to high risk patients with COVID. The Regeneron cocktail has a greater than 70% reduction in similar patients and has a long track record of safety and success. Under ordinary circumstances, more data would be needed to give an EUA to Molnupiravir, but the FDA might indeed do that. Which would you rather have if you were high risk and had COVID 19: A drug that is tried and true and 70% effective in preventing death or hospitalization or a new product, barely tested with no follow-up, that has 50% success?"
if MRK pill pose trouble for REGN why analysts raise estimates for REGN even today?
$800 by end of Sept...
Libtayo's fourth cancer indication approval (which is very likely to happen early next year) and its European approval will push revenue just from this single drug to 3.5 billion annually. This would be up from the 500 million current revenue this year.
It went down today because REGN price moves 20% - 30% inline with vaccine stocks. The volume is too low to assume institutional selloff based on upcoming news. I do think Bancel saying the pandemic will be over by next year made it hard for it to move anywhere but down today. But it's not like covid made regn valuations expensive or it's product line antiquated. if anything monoclonal antibodies proved its usefulness as a therapeutic agent beyond covid.
"6 months after I knew the results, the New England Journal of Medicine finally publishes the 70% reduction in death/hospitalization with REGN antibody combo in high risk patients with COVID-19. Florida and six other states are using 70% of the doses being prescribed. Why is this treatment (by far the best around--forget steroids and remdesivir) not being used more?"
"Hehe. I quit. Made some trading in out. Holding my core, still a little ahead. Next move up I'm movin' on. Never thought I agree with the people on this board saying REGN is manipulated but I have to agree now. This company is a kick@ss company, the stock has a mind of its own."
REGN 28% gain :) waiting for 700 range.
"The 200-day moving average is at 537, and rising. Perhaps that will be where rationality returns. Just know that if you sell now, you’re selling 40% net profit margin for 12.5-times forward earnings."
"Textbook bullish candlestick confirmation today, , . I’m new to this stock, about 7-months, I checked the historical events…Regeneron has never had a stock split, right?"
"Honestly, absolutely no reason to panic. If anything, scoop up as many shares as possible. This is a long term play. You will be really glad in the next 5 years that this stock has given you 100% return. Unlike, biontech and moderna which solely relies on covid sales, regeneron has a burgeoning and growing pipeline with increase in EPS growth, sales and diversified platform of already launched blockbuster drugs."
"HHS data shows that 1.3 million doses have been shipped and 637,000 used. Most have gone to states where the virus is surging, including Florida, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas.REGN's antibody cocktail is becoming a standard therapy for COVID-19. Vaccine could not completely prevent pandemic. SO REGN will earn a lot of money in the future."
"Quite frankly, after a recent runup in last 2 months, I am happy to see SP consolidating around $675 ± 15 to form a solid base.Those who wants to get excited about future of REGN, highly recommend going through corporate presentation available on investors section on their website. Sooooooo much coming down the line in next 4-5 years. I can honestly see this easily reaching $1500 SP, though not sure about that time it will take to reach there. But, it will be there."
It's now coming out that Molnupiravir could be carcinogenic. The study even excluded pregnant women because of birth defect fears. Getting the emergency use authorization may be problematic
Nice gain although it could have been better but I'll take it.
New 52 week high! will break 700$ soon.
$REGN Target Raised by Cantor Fitzgerald Overweight USD 670 » USD 700 Reiterated by HC Wainwright Buy USD 787 » USD 831
"Many people on this platform write to the effect that the market hates this stock and that the price should be higher. As a long time holder (fifteen years plus), I can say that I honestly believe that it is manipulated by large institutional holders. They buy and sell in waves. They all know that this is a strong company heading up but they make a tremendous amount of money by letting it run up on buying by large institutions and then sell in waves. It has happened again and again over the last two decades."
"New 52-week high brings in sellers trying to catch the top, but big buyers are mopping up the new supply. The combination of strong growth and low valuation will keep institutional money flowing in."
"Looks like REGN caught the ""Dangerfield virus"" again! M.S. analyst ""raises price target from 576 to 606???!!!Where have you been? Check out Profit Margin %, Operating Margin %, and ROE % of this company---then tell us this company execs do not know what they are doing!!!!"
Mijta Great financial analysis and knowledge of the stock. Probably have no idea about market or running a business.
PE under 11. If the PE goes under 10 that will be ridiculous. Barron's believe Dupixent will be the most sought out medicine in the world someday. I'm holding.
"The stock needs to rest, so it’s tempting to trade it. But there’s probably support above 650, so downside would be limited, and the decision to buy back in would have to be made before a short-term buy signal is reached. Twelve months from now, earnings should be $45, or higher, and it should trade around 20-times earnings, or $900. Why risk 35% upside to capture 2% downside?"

"Looking at directed trade activity on REGN, there are NO buyers. NO block trades. Drips and drabs. Very few shares on the sell side and NO shares on the buy side drive this stock down in double digits. Daily. I've been holding off but I think now is the time to sell some covered calls.

"Regeneron's Dupixent continues winning streak, says H.C. Wainwright Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Dupixent continued its winning streak this morning with positive Phase 3 results for pediatric atopic dermatitis patients, H.C. Wainwright analyst Michael King tells investors in a research note. The Phase 2/3 trial demonstrated that the addition of Dupixent to standard of care topical cortical steroids significantly diminished disease burden in children and infants with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, according to the analyst. King says Dupixent is now the first biologic to effectively tackle moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in a younger pediatric cohort while remaining the only approved pediatric treatment for children ages six and older. He reiterates a Buy rating on Regeneron with a $787 price target."

"My last update on Regeneron, which is part of the MILLION DOLLARS PORTFOLIO. The correction in the recent weeks to me looks like a great opportunity to look into this company. The value is there and that's why is the HIGHEST position in the portfolio (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)https://youtu.be/sqxqNM5ijRY"
"Fire CEO! He doesn't want the stock to split because he doesn't want retail in the stock. Institutions don't care about price, they make money on spreads and options."
"So, I was checking out how my stocks were #$%$ and saw that REGN was down 17. I jokingly thought to myself, ""uh oh, they must have released some good news."" Sure enough, I see that WHO recommends REGEN-COV."
"$655 close may signal a breakout. Possible minor resistance up to all-time high $664. Tomorrow will be interesting. Assuming avg eps estimates increase to $45 and forward p/e expands to industry-norm of 20, REGN should be $900 within 12 months."
"Despite recent uptrend, still extremely undervalued if you take an objective look. Really very busy and diverse pipeline and a lot is going to happen in near future. Given their success rate of close to 95% in announcing positive trials, I am extremely bullish about this company. Plus, partnerships with intellia, alnylam and Astra Zeneca are going to bear more fruits to this massive tree. If share price reaches $800 by the end of this year, I think it will be quite good.Also, it looks like investors from Biontech and Moderna are jumping over to Regeneron."
Before Covid hit Yancopoulos said they were on course for 3 drug approvals within 6 months. Covid forced them to divert attention and resources away from their pipeline. These valuations are for companies with no future. This company has not gone thru it primary growth phase yet

Amazing run since June .Not sure if I should back my $660 Jan 2022 put that I sold .I am in a dilemma - if I should close and realize capital gains or close in Jan and defer my capital gains to 2022.
Bought in today. Founder led company. Has a nice pipeline. I'd be interested in the company even without monoclonal antibodies. Fundamentals are still cheap.
"I believe Regeneron will be a household name by winter time. The unvaccinated and anyone at the onset of Covid will be encouraged to receive the antibodies. Do the Florida infusion centers provide the antibodies via IV. I thought subcutaneous injection was feasible. Can someone clarify how these Clinics administer the antibodies. Wouldn't it be awesome if those wanting the antibodies could just get a shot in the arm. Regardless as long as Regeneron provides the best antibodies, there will be a worldwide demand for this."
"As I have said again and again, the stock price will take time to appreciate for Regeneron. If you are in this to get rich quick, this is not the stock. Invest as much as possible at these levels. P/E is extremely cheap at 9.23 right now. Invest now, forget it and come back in 5 years. And then, again come back in 10 years. I am expecting it to be around 1200 in most conservative scenario."
Another all time high today!!
"The stock should have been UP at least 5%. There is so much value in this stock at this price. MRNA, ZM or BNTX are jokes compared to REGN. Investing has become gambling."

Fauci spoke about Monoclonals in the news last week, and described them as: "" 'a much-underutilized intervention' in the fight against COVID-19 and said he wants people 'to realize the advantage of this very effective way of treating early infection'. """
"663-680 looks good for a trading range over next couple of weeks, setting up next leg up."
"Whatever the reason for all the great kudos for Regn, the stock has managed to drop over 50 points in this last period whereas the market itself has gone up a good 3%......you wonder what the big boys know about the drugs this company is now hoping to gather traction for .....every good word planted for Regn seems to cause more downslide.....something is going on which i think is a forerunner of more to come badly......Drug stocks are for the hedge funds i think......i just sold half my Regn for my profit and put that into a host of oil companies which offer good dividends and are beginning to creep up......time will tell of course but i am unhappy about what's seems to be happening to this company.....its my opinion of course and the site is loaded with company promoters......"

This is the LAST TIME you will see $BIIB this low. Did you see that $48 million BUY yesterday? We could close WELL above $305 today. Yesterday I said ALL savy biotech traders of stocks like $NOVN $PROG $VXRT $BIVI $EVFM $GBS $CLSN $PTGX $ANVS $SAVA $AUTL $NNVC $ENZN $DRNA $PULM $KMPH $APTX $EOLS $RNLX $VKTX $ORPH $APTO $GLTO $HTBX $FMTX $EQ $VRTX $SYN $CAPA $KLDO $TARS $INZY $FLGT $CVAC $XFOR $ACRS $SANA $JNJ $MRK $MRNA $REGN $LLY etc should be loading $BIIB with both hands. I hope they listened. The trend is BULLISH again. If u can't tell. NEW ANALYST Neddham initiated a BUY coverage Yesterday with a target price of $400! $400 is kinda low to me but at least it's better than where $BIIB is now! Free money  imo.
I know over 7 people just yesterday who got this treatment in Ormond. Florida loves it’s freedom.
"For what it's worth, Jim Cramer recommended Regeneron on Mad Money tonight"
One external force dampering share value is GSK/VIR new antibody testing at 90% effective. It is brand new and better than all others do will garner a growing slice of the pie. Overall effect is starting to show on competition as VIR sales get kicked off and VIR shares begin to stir. Interesting tidbit is VIR is not a one trick pony and has ongoing fda trials for new science directed at solving hepatitis.

"New Regeneron Infusion Center could reduce COVID hospitalizationsBy Joshua SkinnerPublished: Aug. 20, 2021 at 6:42 PM UTC|Updated: 21 hours agoODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - You’d be forgiven if you think the name ‘Regeneron’ sounds more like a Transformer than a way to fight the coronavirus, but if you contract COVID-19, a new Regeneron Infusion Center in Odessa could keep you out of the hospital.“The Regeneron infusion therapy is made out of two drugs whose names are almost unpronounceable,” said Dr. Ogechika Alozie of the Texas Medical Association COVID-19 Task Force.The treatment has shown to be very effective.“This infusion has actually been shown to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations by up to 70%, especially when given within the first 10 days,” Alozie said."
"Are you aware that Pfizer, Glaxo, Roche, Gilead, NIH and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation are currently funding 100% of MTNB's 10-12 LNC Rare Disease Treatments ? Are you also aware that MAT 2203 recently reported the best survival rate (*95%) ever recorded in a Cryptococcal Meningitis study ? Finally, are you aware that Gilead-with MTNB's LNC Platform- has developed an....Oral Formulation of Remdesivir for all variants of Covid that may have the same efficacy and safety profile as Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines ? Pill vs Needle ? Pill wins. Is MTNB a ""baby REGN"" ? Time will tell."
"After reaching overbought in June, REGN worked off the overbought in July by trading in a range of 574-589. In August, the stock reached overbought again and likely will spend September working off the overbought trading in a range of 663-680. That should provide the base to launch the next leg up. Estimates should be raised to $45 average for 2022, and the p/e should expand to 20x, yielding a share price of $900 in the next 12 months."
Why is REGN PE ratio only 12? The pps should be closer to $2000
". Previous versions of Molnupiravir have had mutagenic effects which may lead to birth defects. Because of this the enrollment criteria for the recently terminated clinical trial included only patients who agreed to use contraception and were not pregnant. The clinical trial protocol states"" Males agree to the following during the intervention period and for at least 4 days after the last dose of study intervention: Either abstain from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent; or must agree to use contraception.Females are not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP); or is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (a low user dependency method OR a user dependent method in combination with barrier method), or be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) for at least 4 days after the last dose of study intervention; a WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum test is required) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention.One case of severe birth defect will sink Merck's ship"
Complete over reaction and completely oversold at this point but unfortunately you sometimes can't fight the tape. Will make for a great buying opportunity by the big boys once the dust settles. This would be a $700 stock if it weren't for Covid.
"The money made last quarter from Covid antibody was more than the rest of the entire portfolio. 5% correction, get over it."
"I dont really follow Cramer but I do agree with him when he said ""I just think Regeneron has got the best eye franchise there is, and that’s the one I’d like to see you in. ... Regeneron demonstrates its greatness over and over and over again. Let’s stick with best of breed"""
"Wow, market is counting Regn as pure covid play. They think that in light of new data from Merck, regeneron sales will slumber. But, regn was never a pure covid play. It has so many blockbuster approved drugs whose sales are burgeoning and pipeline is looking extremely promising with every study being declared positive. Regencov was just a cherry on the top. Ignore the cherry, look at the whole icecream. Scoop as many shares as you can."

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announces negative COVID-19 test after Regeneron antibody treatment
"I'm here for the post covid years. If you look at the chart, REGN can go up quickly. Not an ideal way to start off an investment but I'm emotionally removed from the day to day emotion of daily price moves"

Been in 7 years buy all dips made bunch of money. Covid one time short time frame deal. Costly because costly to make. Revenue will drop but earnings will still support pe that will still value stock at around $650 . All about eylea and especially dupixent and now litayo. More to come. Not a covid play.
This stock must have set the record for sell short at the open and cover at the close to make a daily profit. Like clockwork.

"With a PE of 10, this is one of the cheapest stocks. There's a lot of upside and many reasons to buy and hold. The MERK news hurt it in the short term but this makes it an opportuntity to buy the dip. Personally I'd like to see a 5 for 1 stock split to make it more affordable for smaller inverstors. What do you think?"
This stock is listless. Which may not be a bad thing.
"I don't usually mind hearing the rational of shorts. However, come with something more than ""I held it for six months, during that very specific time period it never went up even on good news, it was super frustrating and even though it's a great company I shorted."""
The product works great and the courts will stop the mandated vaccines just like they have done on all of his other illegal actions.
Average 2022 earnings estimate has increased to $44.03.
One thing I don't like that I've been seeing now for two weeks is the end of day volume spikes correlated with price deterioration. I at first thought it was day trading activity but late day volume is too high and is not by percent consistent with biotechs or nasdaq

"1.5 million doses sold to the U.S. Gov’t for about $2.6 billion. 125,000 doses being delivered a week at this point. Regeneron announces that if a new contract is struck they can deliver this year. Big questions are when will they announce a contract, how much will it add up to, and how will it impact share prices? Any guesses?"
"I'm not going to cry that the markets are unfair. Reality is this potentially impacts future revenues so of course it's going to be factored in. I was surprised the news didn't hit the stock yesterday. institutional guidance likely is being revised down, so are projected valuations so there's a selloff. i wonder if this was the potential news overhanging this stock for weeks. And I don't really care. This week i asked myself whether I'm going to long this stock or sell it at a loss and reposition late Oct in a different corrected stock. I'm just going to hold it for a year and see what it is in a post covid market then re-access. I wrote on MRNA board last week that new Covid vaccines and treatments are going to come out and they need a deeper pipeline to not collapse. Regeneron has that pipeline and once we can focus on it then it should go up. My REGN buy timing was reckless but long-term it should not matter much"
does Merck's treatment have lower efficacy than regn's? Do people use Merc's when they have a choice to use a better one?
"undervalued for sure. have my money tied up in other positions, but will likely take a position in the future. cheap p/e, consistently beating earnings. I like it a lot."
"Oh well, another typical Regn week. Need to move past this Covid focus and get back to business."
