Dupixent will become the most widely used pharmaceutical drug  on the planet during the top half of this decade. Not just my opinion. A recent Barron's article has the same sentiment.
I think it's up because Sanofi's upward guidance caused by the explosive growth of Dupixent which is jointly owned by Regeneron. They expect 5 billion in revenue from Dupixent and cite that this is especially impressive with in person doctor visits still down because of the pandemic. Also there was a coverage initiation by Dillon and associates
"October 28, 20217:00 am ET Regeneron Pharma Is Maintained at Outperform by SVB Leerink with the target price of $798Dow Jones6:50 am ET SVB Leerink Maintains Outperform on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Raises Price Target to $798"
Really not surprised at all to see high jump. This is extremely undervalued. Should easily be sitting at $900 SP right now. Will not be surprised either if this goes to $700 really quickly in a week leading up to earnings report next week.
"We're up 30 points from the week's lows already. With earnings approaching, this stock can relatively quickly make up the 17% loss last month"
"Sanofi beat their Q3 estimates quite handily and raised full year guidance (there is only two months left in the year anyway!)The outperformance was largely on account of Dupixent, which means that REGN will benefit from the same trend; how much of this is already in the price is the question now"
"The stars are all aligned for this stock; at the moment it is Dupi across multiple type-2 inflammation indications at the moment but soon it will be their likely to be best in class PD-1 inhibitor drug Libtayo (with multiple interesting combination therapies undergoing clinical trials) which will eventually prove to be even better than Merckâ€™s first in class PD-1 inhibitor KeytrudaAfter that will be the turn of gene therapies being currently developed in collaboration with Intellia, and Roche, and so onThe only cloud hanging on this stock is the Medicare drug price negotiation legislation that is slowly sputtering through congress; this makes it impossible to put a confident value on their pipeline"
578-605 gap filled.
"Well, reason behind today's increase in SP is because of strong sales recorded by Sanofi for Dupixent. Profits are split with Regeneron. Dupixent is growing tremendously and Sanofi is looking to update its guidance on how much peak sales Dupixent can bring in moving forward. Initially, analysts though it will peak at $10B but now it might grow into $15B franchise as Dupixent scores positive results in various trials suggesting upstream activity in revenue generation.As I have always said, hold and grow your position. Its still very cheap. Most analysts are raising their target and now its close to $900 price target which is in line with how I value REGN based on P/E metric. Still very cheap!!"
"Is it possible a bigger pharma company would try to work out a merger with REGN? I can see some logicin it for the right ""player""."
Another positive trial result for dupixent! Easy peasy getting this past regulatory hurdle as dupixent has now well established safety and efficacy profile. Another revenue stream. Another source for EPS growth in years to come.
"REGN is a great science-driven biologics discovery organization, and I love that they're expanding into more therapeutic areas. But an issue that remains in my mind from their blockbuster ophthalmology area is the patent life of Eylea. It comprises such a large portion of their product revenue that there's a looming concern of competition from biosimilars. Can anyone share when Eylea patent protection will expire, and their thoughts on the competitive threat to that blockbuster product?"
"Honestly, I feel this is one of the last times, you are going to see REGN trading in $550-600 range unless some life shattering event like pandemic happens again. I picked up few shares last week at $560. In wake of back to back recent positive news for dupixent, I think its going to become a drug in a pipeline in itself. Not to mention, other strong brands like Eyelea, Libtayo etc and more coming from the pipeline!"
"Atea Pharmaceuticals/Roche's Covid antiviral pill failed in phase 3 trials. It had the same impact as the placebo. They are saying it may have been the test design so they are going to redo it but it will delay results for a year. Also, there is renewed concern that these drugs are mutagenic and will cause cancer. Even Merck now say their antiviral may cause cancer but they believe not from short term use. Would you take a pill that has cancer as a potential side effect?"
"ARKG sold 15,000 shares on REGN holdings on Friday. They definitely have been selling consistently but it's not enough to cause this kind of downtrend. I usually have a feel for what's going on but I really have no idea what's moving the stock right now and neither does anyone I talk to"
Roche on the prowl?
REGN was upgraded today by Leerink. 798 price target
I see clearer thinking on these boards than I do at the institutions that dumped REGN on the Merck news.
Not seeing any news. Is someone trading on inside information about earnings on Nov 4?
"Still extremely undervalued. Should be comfortably around $900 by all metrics. Eyelea biosimilars conerns are overblown, dupixent is emerging as a strong revenue driver, one of the most exciting pipelines, several game changing drugs are coming in next 3-5 years from their collaboration with Alnylam, Intellia. Alnylam already has proven track record of 3 siRNA approval in the market and whatever they have with REGN, pretty sure that many of those programs will be able to finish across the line and bring in more revenues. Yahoo needs to bring in 'Extremely Bullish' tab below."
