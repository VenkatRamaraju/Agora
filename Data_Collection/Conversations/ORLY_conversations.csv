Earnings positive
this is quite the pounding

"Zack's has ORLY as a Sell, but sales and profits are rising as is the stock price. Cash flow is much improved. Why sell? I don't get it."
Fox business is showing ORLY down $50 PM. Anyone else see this on the crawler?
The chart makes me want to think ORLY might have a bit of a downward retracement this week...seems it went up awfully fast and I don't see many people at their stores....
I guess car parts are more valuable than life saving drugs.Advance Auto Parts #AAP $124.85 up $5.24 +4.38%AutoZone #AZO $1057.90 up $45.74 +4.52%O'Reilly Automotive #ORLY $402.51 up $16.06 +4.16%
how is oreillys doing good lol. there's like 5 in my city and they are all EMPTY when I go in them....
ORLY is down 4.90% to 374.23
"my my,over one billion loss in one day...do the math."
The whole automotive parts industry is way down today. AZO and also down almost 4%. But ORLY is down over 5%.
ORLY will report strong earnings after hours today!!!
"amzn,is 45% cheaper plus with free ship..now,where are you going to buy your next water pump ect.."
"I worked as a Designer for O'Reilly for 13 years in the Real Estate department. On April 24th I was told they would have to let me go. They said it was because of Covid-19. The way they let me go was demoralizing. There was no thank you for a job well done or any severance pay of any kind. They said they wouldn't fight any unemployment monies though. I have many friends at O'Reilly and I wish the best for them, but I had to get this off my chest. I am a 62 year old male that has underlying health issues. Maybe that is the reason they let me go, I don't know. It's all about the money for O'Reilly even though they talk about their ""O'Reilly Culture"". Yes, i'm mad as hell, so I'm putting my two cents worth in. There is no ""Team"" in Team O'Reilly. It is a culture where only a select few reap the rewards."
Buy! Will be $490 after earnings.
Google oreilly auto parts racist videos...or view Facebook...groups...

"Last night, told you that shorting orly on cooked earning at $390 was an easy play…… zero guidance says it all.…..azo and orly are such easy play on short side…. still got more orders to short at $395 and $425"
"same part OR $175 rebuilt w poor parts..ebay part NEW $30.00......guess which one lasted over 6 months so far....OR part was replaced 3x in 9 months...ebay part...over 6 months 7,000 miles not a bit of trouble....4 other parts lasted under 1 month before failing ...from OR....refused to refund"
Why did the stupid guy from Texas asked Cramer about selling or keeping. Cramer is ridiculous in saying 1 work - sell.
ORLY will close at $ 370 today!!!

ORLY reached a new 52 Week High at $355.17
Wasteful brick and mortar -- 50% of it is excess and the clowns manning the stores crack me up.
"expensive, no dividend, my guess is they have a lot of inventories and turn over is pretty slow"
Amazon pumpers here. First of all I don`t hold ORLY just looking at it. I`ve been in trucking for a lot of years so when it comes to parts for cars or trucks you take the part to the store to match. Can`t do that at Amazon. You have to wait for delivery---doesn`t work well. I made a recent purchase for something else on Amazon. Got a $ 6 item when I paid $ 80.00 for a totally different product. So far batting 0 and it ain`t funny. You have to have local stores to get done what needs to be done unless you have all year for some off project. Anything I purchase online will either be from a private store or EBAY. That`s it. Amazon sucks.
DPW is up 5% happy trading
what's happening today with ORLY?
ORLY BEATS ON QUARTERLY EARNINGS!!!

Why this pre market drop ?
"Is anyone on this board boycotting Scamazon? Since Scamazon wants to sell auto parts, it is up to you to protect your investments."
Earning release tomorrow…… OUCH... !!!! This sector is going into the toilet…. they borrowed big money to their buyback programs plus took all profits…. now their left with few money and big debt…. disaster is on the way for orly and azo….. both are ow scams…...
Earnings are good. What is the reason for fall ?
so who warranties you car engine when their new made in Vietnam oil filters fail ?? guess what no one....they are charging $9.50 for a filter that costs less than $2.50 wholesale....
"Don't kick dirt on the ""auto parts"" grave just yet. If the media had it's way, It would make the point that Amazon proves an existential threat to every business and industry in the US. O'Reilly specializes in auto parts; Amazon specializes in e-comerce. what's next? Does Amazon prove an existential threat to my local church?"
Cash is flowing out of this stock like a bad oil leak.
ORLY reached an all time high at 451.39

ORLY is up 5.11% to 421.00
Management shifts due to key people leaving is finally taking its toll. Leadership is too busy glad-handing each other and promoting friends instead of knowledgeable proven assets and is not taking care of the field staff and degenerate proletarian servants. In our area leadership is absent most of the time and moral is very low so it’s hard to remain enthused. On the pro side still many seasoned professionals on board so it should bounce back as long as they stay.
O'Reilly Automotive reached an all time high at 480.00
I would wait a couple of days before buying..........in case one is interested in buying that is........jmo
$130-135 fair price I think
"Miss on earnings, slight miss on Revenues. This was already priced to perfection, will have to see what the management projects going forward. At least $20 - $30 drop in the following week!"
ORLY IS RALLYING IN TO THE CLOSE!!! I EXPECT ANOTHER GREAT QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORT!!!
Dam I sold at 492 first time I've seen this stock into the 500's the analyst did say 520-530 be careful don't buy close to the top

ORLY is next BlockBuster going out of business due to online shopping
what is going on with this stock?
ORLY is down 4.93% to 377.15
ORLY had a good day yesterday but that doesn't mean it will keep going. BOYCOTT AMAZON since they want to get part of the business. If you spend your money somewhere else it takes away money that Amazon can use to hurt the auto parts suppliers.
they should publish their earning today according to https://wallmine.com/nasdaq/orly
I MADE ALOT OF MONEY SHORTING
"This happen a few days ago..a women went to a Oreilly store to purchase a new starter for 2004 ford Taurus 3.O .v6...after it was install they found it was a REMAN .not new..and she paid 143.57.plus had to return the old core..or repay another 10.00 bucks. later she found out on the internet she could had bought a new one..not rebuilt.49.95 now this is crooked place to buy anything..we 're going to tell the world..some of the people that works their says that's how they stay in business ,just lie."
PLEASE GO DOWN MORE SHORTED 423.50

ORLY reached a 52 Week low at 346.06
A lot of O'Reilly product is produced in and comes from China. What impact will the shuttering of factories because of the coronavirus have on supply? This may though be a good time to turn some of that inventory into cash.
"going under $10 soon, get out ASAP"
There is not much supply of stock . The employees stock purchase program probably keeps a steady stream of buying going in addition to the stellar earnings !
"Net Income DOWN 6.5% from 1 year ago. Shareholder equity is down 73% in one quarter?. The share buyback 574M mistake blowing much of their cash @400sh necessitated placing 500M in senior notes 4.2% to temporarily stay liquid. 4.6B in current liabilities(12Months) with only 287M in cash. All guidance has been pulled. Expect massive insider selling @ these prices. Debt is $150sh. Shareholder equity has fallen to 108M on 75M shares. $375 per share gets you $1.44sh equity and $148/sh in debt. Its been a good run, time to get out."
SHORTED AFTER HOURS HOPE IT PAYS OFF IN MORNING
"they need to investigates orly soon..their business is going bellow up..very few customers if any..but,they are pulling another trick to make things look better for the owners only."
"I know the earnings here are great due to stock buybacks over the years, however I believe the supply chain is broken down. Another huge worry is the 40 million of cash on hand with 5 billion in debt. They should have paid down all their debt or a combination of debt/buyback to not be in this position."
WILL ORLY SPLIT
I told you this would happen...I'm glad I sold at $286.50/sh

Is there something else wrong with ORLY other than the MACD chart taking it down ? I know they missed their estimate for rev but wondering if some other underlying problem exists.
"I don't think Amazon is going to take over Orly's business. Who wants to order a part from Amazon without any consultation with someone who knows? Will Amazon arrive to put on my new wildshield wiper blades, etc. BOYCOTT ALL THINGS AMAZON."

People rather pay for car maintenance than buy a new car in this economy. I expect ORLY to out perform last quarter.
ORLY is down 6.92% to 348.44
My car is collecting duat for the past 6 months. No need for anything car related.
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON , ORLYs profits will suffer. Amazon is getting into auto parts, so don't buy anything from them giving them more money to help destroy other business. We need physical stores. Don't think one little old buy from amazon won't hurt because giving them any money hurts. Amazon is the enemy of all retail."
SHORT SHORT SELL SELL SHORT IT
"selling it all and walking away..tucking some back, and waiting for the price to drop all the way down..down down down.."
"I have been a mechanic for 35 years here is the problems with these big box 1. they are staffed with idiots. 2 the prices are often a lot more money for basic stuff oil,freon etc.3 newer cars just do not like the aftermarket parts that don`t fit or work I would rather run to the dealer make less on the part banfg the labor up and not have to worry about fit and reliability.I will admit ORLY has bailed me out here and there and I buy a lot from my local store but it has been less and less as the years go by and see myself at the dealer and the independent, mom and pop store more."
"One of my trucks developed a bad hesitation over the weekend while 80 miles away from home. I ran over to the local O'Reilly and described the problem. The gentlemen said he was very knowledgeable about my vehicle and had 3 in his family. Immediately thought it was the plug wires (I thought it was an ignition coil). We hooked up the diagnostic device to the truck and it was mis-firing on cylinder 8. I bought a new set of plugs wires, and used a set of loaner tools he handed to me. I went around the corner, found a good shady spot, swapped out the plugs and wires (#8 cylinder was a bear to get out), and problem fixed. I'm not sure Amazon would have been able to offer me the same level of service. Yes, I could have saved money on buying the plugs and wires online, but understand there is a cost to having a physical location nearby, people, parts in stock, etc. that need to be factored in. I guess Amazon would agree since they are now getting into brick and mortar with Whole Foods."
THIS WONT SEE 423 NO MORE SHORT IT NOW
SHORTED AT 423 422
"OReilly earning slow again as results guidance.disappoint stock falls...what other do you expect ..when their parking lots stays empty 90% OF THE TIME. most of their new parts has been rebuilt..not new...but are price up 400% AT TIMES.. they are worry like some of the rest...ON LINE...IT HAS BEEN REPORTED.. within 2 years or less..there want be many local auto parts,that can afford to stay open...THANKS TO THE INTERNET ON LINE..."

what's wrong with ORLY
p.e. still too high. good buy at 75.
What is the need for early guidance?
"Debt over 2 Billion, Cash at hand 0, get out here or loose all"
Why is this down 4% pre market?
ORLY reached a new All Time High at 305.00
stores have no customers at the moment...beware money has dried up....1 customer per hour cannot sustain this company
When ORLY gets new high?
There aren’t any catalysts near term that can lift the stock back to previous levels in the 430 pps range. Company should consider offering dividends rather than share buybacks
4th qtr results were ok but however growth has slowed.
GO ORLY GO!!!

WHAT IS GOING ON
Boycott Amazon or you deserve losing money.
EXACTLY ... what's up with massive decline. But not just O'Reilly ... Autozone down over 11% for the day! What market information caused such a massive hit. Simply Fed comments on interest rate hikes? Wouldn't logic seem inflation = less new car purchases and MORE aftermarket parts as people keep cars longer and have to buy parts ? I don't get it. Retail auto parts market should be much more stable ?! More volatile than gold right now !
Why Company released this information before earnings ? Any idea. I was expecting on 26 th. Any idea about recovery anytime soon.
ORLY will blow away the analyst predictions! Just watch
ORGY is a great stock. GL guys.
AMZN is going to kill ORLY
O'Reilly Automotive is down 4.97% to 433.80
"This is another odd stock. It seems to move 6% sometimes in one day! I never advocate day trading, but it is hard not to have an interest in it when you see this stock do this now...hmmm...FOUR times in the last month! Too unstable for me, jumping ship at the next 212 range. I bought in early July when it was 182 or so. Swings way too much."
LETSS DO IT GUSY LETS DO IT
Any idea why the 3.17% drop in pre-market? tariffs related?
"No I don't think it's Amazon, it's Rock Auto. Carries many brands, prices. Parts come in just a few days. But ORLY still is a cut above AutoZone and Advance, which really carry the cheap stuff. Some ORLY stuff is competitive to Rock Auto. If ORLY carries the better stuff, and gets their prices in order, they can still compete well I think. I think this drop is WAY overdone and will bounce nicely. I don't own the stock but will buy some options I think."
That’s what it shows

"bad parts, racial videos about employees and customers, labor issues at all stores, turn over of management, 9 billion in bebt....annual sales will just barely cover that ....most store are poorly managed by managers that absolutely refuse to honor or obey company policies ...charging employees for uniforms that should be free under state and federal laws....getting rid of people by email claiming they violated some kind of illusionary company policy that is broke on a daily basis by others...bad company bad business....thousands of complaints no resolution to any of them"
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? If not continue losing money on Orly. It is your choice. Give money to the enemy or take charge of your life.
What’s wrong with this stock ?
Withdraws guidance…!!!! LMAO..... shorting $385 and I'm going to 3x my short position…….. shorting at every $5-$7.... I've got no limit price….
"$TVIX $UVXYThis is from Morgan Stanley on ORLY. I post it because it highlights one of the biggest problems with this market. Morgan Stanley analyst says "" Hence, we are raising our price target to $430 (from $400) and seea positive risk/reward skew from here, thus lean positive in the context of ourEqual-weight rating. However, we choose to stay on the sidelines as we do notcurrently have a high level of confidence that ORLY can comp 4%+ in 2020""Huh ?!? I remember when analysts had brains that worked. This analyst has a price target of $430 when the stock is trading at $437 and thinks there is a positive risk reward (if the price target is accurate there is negative risk reward) BUT wont recommend because they think they can't meet next years comps.....but you think it is a positive risk reward???"
You have to think a split is coming. It needs more liquidity anyways. This has been a great stock.
Get ready to go under $150 in first one hour
Should see recovery this week with all of the tech turmoil.
A split must be in the future
