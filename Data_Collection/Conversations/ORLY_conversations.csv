Great earnings and it gets whacked in AH.....HORRIBLE!!!
"I've hold the stock for 8 year's, and sold it @$489.00 and make a great profit ""Thanks to very good management!"
The chart makes me want to think ORLY might have a bit of a downward retracement this week...seems it went up awfully fast and I don't see many people at their stores....
O'Reilly Automotive reached an all time high at 654.93
The market for used cars/AUTOPARTS is outperforming the new car market by 100% right now !!!!
Parking lot is empty. How is this doing so good? Cartel front???
You have to think a split is coming. It needs more liquidity anyways. This has been a great stock.
"known. bad parts, bad customer service..failing to honor warranty as agreed..thousands of complaints at bbb unresolved...company should be out of business not trading stock"
O'Reilly Automotive is down 5.21% to 617.05
"$TVIX $UVXYThis is from Morgan Stanley on ORLY. I post it because it highlights one of the biggest problems with this market. Morgan Stanley analyst says "" Hence, we are raising our price target to $430 (from $400) and seea positive risk/reward skew from here, thus lean positive in the context of ourEqual-weight rating. However, we choose to stay on the sidelines as we do notcurrently have a high level of confidence that ORLY can comp 4%+ in 2020""Huh ?!? I remember when analysts had brains that worked. This analyst has a price target of $430 when the stock is trading at $437 and thinks there is a positive risk reward (if the price target is accurate there is negative risk reward) BUT wont recommend because they think they can't meet next years comps.....but you think it is a positive risk reward???"
O'Reilly Automotive reached an all time high at 639.64
"I know the earnings here are great due to stock buybacks over the years, however I believe the supply chain is broken down. Another huge worry is the 40 million of cash on hand with 5 billion in debt. They should have paid down all their debt or a combination of debt/buyback to not be in this position."
"Lets go short on this one, most recs met or bearish from now on"
ORLY is up 7.6 percent after beating consensus 3rd Quarter net income estimates by 29 cents per share. Revenues rose 7.7 percent to $2.67 billion for the quarter.
so who warranties you car engine when their new made in Vietnam oil filters fail ?? guess what no one....they are charging $9.50 for a filter that costs less than $2.50 wholesale....
Orly's has a $693 price target and a #1 rating from Zachs.
Vectorvest has a Buy and a fair value of $793 on Orly.
O O O’REILLY AUTO PARTS TO THE MOON!
There aren’t any catalysts near term that can lift the stock back to previous levels in the 430 pps range. Company should consider offering dividends rather than share buybacks
"I worked as a Designer for O'Reilly for 13 years in the Real Estate department. On April 24th I was told they would have to let me go. They said it was because of Covid-19. The way they let me go was demoralizing. There was no thank you for a job well done or any severance pay of any kind. They said they wouldn't fight any unemployment monies though. I have many friends at O'Reilly and I wish the best for them, but I had to get this off my chest. I am a 62 year old male that has underlying health issues. Maybe that is the reason they let me go, I don't know. It's all about the money for O'Reilly even though they talk about their ""O'Reilly Culture"". Yes, i'm mad as hell, so I'm putting my two cents worth in. There is no ""Team"" in Team O'Reilly. It is a culture where only a select few reap the rewards."
