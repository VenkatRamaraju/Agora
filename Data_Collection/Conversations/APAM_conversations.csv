"APAM has transaction today for shares to sell and buy from one entity to another; confusing;bottom line looks like anti-dilutive, so stock lower if can stay above 35.Given BEN bought LM, down the road, APAM could meet the same by another bigger entity or bank and up +20%.Consolidation coming IMO...I give it up to 2 years to happen."
