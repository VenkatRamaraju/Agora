"I almost never buy value/divy stocks, BUT this is an A++ stock. Its got it all, higher div, solid growth and potential upside, low valuation."
We should be hitting a new 52 week high soon with today's announcements.
"I realize this stock isn't widely held and high volume, but one would think there would be a few more people here."
Artisan Partners Asset Management is down 4.98% to 48.68
Sept AUM was lower than Aug AUM by a significant 4%. What's up?
APAM announced $!.07 dividend for the current Quarter up from $.83 last year.
Great management with a very good dividend and upside of $60.00/shares. Doesnâ€™t get better for people looking a steady income!
"Just an observation APAM and other money management firms like CG, AB, KKR, etc have the same exact 5 days charts .. all climbing 8 - 10%. Flying under the radar.. only institutional money. I hardly ever see any posts on these stocks on Reddit or Twitter."
$1.07 dividend payed Nov 30. Ex Dividend Date Nov. 16.
if I own this stock today October 26th an I eligible for the latest dividend??
The market moves in mysterious ways.
Added 50 shares on the dip.
AUM measured in $$ is a poor measure on a short term basis. It can be misinterpreted as lost clients when it is simply dips in asset values.
Buying opportunity
I never seen a stock that produces great dividends like APAM did and fall over 5% the next day?
Bought a little yesturday
Agreed that this is a good buying opportunity to lock in a solid dividend stock at a discount
