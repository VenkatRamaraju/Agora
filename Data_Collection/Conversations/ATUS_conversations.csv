"down 27% from the high , time to buy !"
SHORT SQUEEZE!!!
"Way, way oversold. This like coiled spring....will be above $18 in no time."
"there are few certain thing in the world, like the sun sets and ATUS comes down. I guessed we bottomed but not"
I also did not receive special dividend.
"It's not the cord cutters they're losing - it's regular cable users who are totally FED UP with Optimum's horrible customer service. You cannot get them on the phone and when you do they do not know ANYTHING about their own services. You can wait for days to get an issue resolved that has nothing to do with power outages or equipment problems. They used to be fantastic when they were still Optimum and run by the Dolans....too bad, but not surprised at all!"
"Target price $10- 12, earnings taking a huge hit, very slow growth prospects"
"There's a huge short interest on this stock. At 16% of float, it's almost as big as AMC (19%). Massive short squeeze potential once the shorts cover.https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ATUS/short-interest/"
what a bad day. most people dont need or want cable. the pain will continue
I just got a 40% price increase for my internet service from Optimum
"Interesting. Same company, same greedy people, same methods, same results.FYI, Altice has done exactly the same in France, start from being a cable operator with very bad reputation (Numericable, the customers used to call it 'misericable', no need to translate), they then bought a DSL/Mobile/Fiber optic operator (SFR) and while keeping its name 'SFR' (to hide the Misericable reputation under the carpet), they pushed for years the obsolete cable technology instead of continuing the move to fibre optic. Result: SFR customers running away, complaints explode (55% of complaints for 25% of market shares...). And cherry on the cake, they tried recently to scuttle semi-public fibre initiatives (in area where the ROI are not good enough for private company to build a network fast enough, partially public investments help to push the fibre deployment) for which they lost the adjudication by menacing to build a concurrent network in the same area. The Altice management did tricks such as make SFR borrow #$%$1,6 billions in 2015 to pay more dividends to share holders, mostly Altice and its chairman... Now they have to pay for all this. Altice CEO (P. Drahi) just dismissed, and then blamed the former SFR managing director (whom he hired) for the mess, ROFL. Before that they were blaming the previous SFR owners..."
what caused a 20% drop today?
"simple mathassumptions1.they buy back $750m worth of stock between now and year end2. average daily trading volume 5m shares (based on post separation volume)3. they buy back 10% of ADV, i.e. 500k shares per day when the window is open (approx. 2 months out of the quarter)4 stock price $17Result: they need 89 days to buy back the full $750mhowever, there are not 89 trading days between now and year end when the window is open. I estimate 70 days.So they have to buy back more than 10% of ADV.This should have a meaningful impact on price.They will also likely buy more sooner, given the current price level, so even more impact on price...."
"What happened to the special dividend payment? Stock price was adjusted on the NYSE for its payment, but have been advised the company cancelled the dividend payment...anybody know anything about this?"
one lonely board here.

How is the stock price so low when my bills are so high
"Cancelled my Optimum TV service and moved to YouTube TV. No more high package costs, cable box rental fees, DVR fees, taxes and #$%$ content packaging. The trend is going to kill the cable TV companies."
"Some one bought 5K May 25 PUTS for $8.40 and at same time sold 25 call for $0.25. So, each PUT net cost is about $8.15. In order for this trader to make money, ATUS will need to remain below 16.85. This tells that stock is going further down after earnings on May 9th."

ViacomCBS and Altice USA Renew Distribution Agreement
"oversold is an understatement, this is a $28 - $34 dollar stock . I've add to my position , good cash flow and ebitda. YES Altice has problems but at this price it's a no- brainer. next week back to $25"
"now,it's a BUY/STRONG BUY!"
"Very over valued, see debts here"
SPX rrcord highs this one keeps falling instead. Poisoned?
"Just went Long 100 shares of ATUS at $31.40 as an Earnings play. Was not my #1 pick, I like CVS much better, but I think earnings will be very good, revenues will beat, guidance will be fine, and she will pop up nicely tomorrow. Worthy of a conservative, 100 share play right here."
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than ATUS

"Three cheers for our President ""jeye""David Einhorn's Greenlight disclosed that his fund has gained 18% in the 1st half of 2019, which is at least on par w/ $SPY's 18.2% YTD return. $TPX $AER $ATUS $VOYA $GM recovered nicely and helped performance. We estimated its stock only portfolio gained 16% YTD."
"Everyone has lost faith in this company as a whole. They took an already broken system (Legacy Cablevision) and are using most of those very inefficient ""tools"" when attempting to combine the two legacy systems, Cablevision and Suddenlink. Customers are bailing any chance they get, the employees that haven't been let go are jumping ship too. The business model isn't working, obviously. With both customers and employees jumping ship, it makes since why the price is dropping. Maybe they should invest in people and tools that work. Cutting costs in the beginning, can cost more in the end."

EU imposed a fine for jumping the gun on it's bid for PT Portugal. This is going to bounce once the regulators let them off the hook. BUY!!!!
I bought lows sold last week major for mere... Never made money office cable vision
going back to $20 after earning
"This stock is worth min $28 - $30 ... Charter will buy or Patrick will take it private for that. It's way, way ,way oversold. I'm buying .."
Dropped way too much. Good price to load in. Way too overreaction
"Suddenlink's customer service has deteriorated to the point of being non-existent. Most people I know in my area have cancelled their Suddenlink service due to this. This company can't prosper for long with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THEIR INDUSTRY. This is going to catch up with them in lower sales, etc. Not sure how it got so bad, but it's a fact."
this goes private at $28
"Less than half the P/E ratio of Comcast and Charter.Less than half the Price/Sales ratio of Comcast and Charter.Median analyst price target of $36.Small amount of negative shareholders equity (1B, or 10% of their yearly revenue).Yes, the company sucks. Yes, the management sucks. But you cannot deny that at $19, ATUS is a steal compared to competitors. I see a 100% potential upside here, with quite limited downside.Do your own DD as always."
Anyone else think this is on sale? Charter bounced but this is the laggard for sure. We do have a special dividend coming up as well.
