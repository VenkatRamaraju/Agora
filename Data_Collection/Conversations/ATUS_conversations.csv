"They are squeezing every dime out of this business.. This model is not sustainable in a competitive market. The SuddenLink footprint is not at risk because the customers have no choice, but in the northeast i would expect to see a shift to FiOS over the next few years. No billing calls after 8 pm, customer service eventually completely outsourced, IVR hangs up on you to avoid transferring to an agent, charging for modems, inferior products, unable to get the new box out the door because its a POS, extended outages....the list goes on and on.."

"Suddenlink in Arizona is completely #$%$! Intermittent, can?t connect customer service unless you commit 1/2day then no help. One CS rep actually hung up on me. I pay for 400 mb - Speedtest is 95% under 100!!! (After hundreds of tests) . Now have made 6 calls looking for help or credit. What did I get ? zip! Just a late charge on my account while trying to reach them. Most CS reps have very poor English. This company is going down."

Wouldn't touch it. Its a dying business taken over by some schmuck spendthift. Not a good combination.
"I have slide down the food chain, from Verizon to Cricket and found that that was too far. It was time for a new phone and I started searching for another carrier. I discovered Altice, that had a nice selection of phones, the plans were favorable and I decided to give “her” a try. They offered a $40 plan with unlimited talk, text & data. Their cell towers they use are AT&T’s I live in the New York metro, the signal strength is great, they are soon offering 5g signal strength. I am quite pleased with this carrier."

You should have ATUS in your protfolio at close of business day today to get dividend. Is this right?
"Interesting. Same company, same greedy people, same methods, same results.FYI, Altice has done exactly the same in France, start from being a cable operator with very bad reputation (Numericable, the customers used to call it 'misericable', no need to translate), they then bought a DSL/Mobile/Fiber optic operator (SFR) and while keeping its name 'SFR' (to hide the Misericable reputation under the carpet), they pushed for years the obsolete cable technology instead of continuing the move to fibre optic. Result: SFR customers running away, complaints explode (55% of complaints for 25% of market shares...). And cherry on the cake, they tried recently to scuttle semi-public fibre initiatives (in area where the ROI are not good enough for private company to build a network fast enough, partially public investments help to push the fibre deployment) for which they lost the adjudication by menacing to build a concurrent network in the same area. The Altice management did tricks such as make SFR borrow #$%$1,6 billions in 2015 to pay more dividends to share holders, mostly Altice and its chairman... Now they have to pay for all this. Altice CEO (P. Drahi) just dismissed, and then blamed the former SFR managing director (whom he hired) for the mess, ROFL. Before that they were blaming the previous SFR owners..."
How long should i wait to invest in Altice
"the problem is, I'm too good and it's gotten boring."
Congrats to new longs!
"Everyone has lost faith in this company as a whole. They took an already broken system (Legacy Cablevision) and are using most of those very inefficient ""tools"" when attempting to combine the two legacy systems, Cablevision and Suddenlink. Customers are bailing any chance they get, the employees that haven't been let go are jumping ship too. The business model isn't working, obviously. With both customers and employees jumping ship, it makes since why the price is dropping. Maybe they should invest in people and tools that work. Cutting costs in the beginning, can cost more in the end."

"simple mathassumptions1.they buy back $750m worth of stock between now and year end2. average daily trading volume 5m shares (based on post separation volume)3. they buy back 10% of ADV, i.e. 500k shares per day when the window is open (approx. 2 months out of the quarter)4 stock price $17Result: they need 89 days to buy back the full $750mhowever, there are not 89 trading days between now and year end when the window is open. I estimate 70 days.So they have to buy back more than 10% of ADV.This should have a meaningful impact on price.They will also likely buy more sooner, given the current price level, so even more impact on price...."
