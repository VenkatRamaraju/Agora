Thanks to AMC investors now have noticed the real company which makes money AMCX - won’t be long before this is squeezed into 100+
"Seriously these wrong AMC comments kill me! We haven't even started with volume yet! No one is picking the wrong AMC!!! Anyone here has chosen the right AMC! The one with a buisiness that makes money, crushed earning expectation and if the momentum traders want has a way way way higher short % than the other AMC and way way way less shares and way way way less volume! So sorry but this is truly the ""Right"" AMC!"
"If this one had great earnings, it WOULD NOT have high short interest...haha!Just another distraction tactic by HFs :)AMC is where we will pump till 1000+ ... not here"
who ever buys this (Comcast I'm thinking) is getting it REAL cheap at 80
"How are AMC and Lionsgate still stand alone companies. These companies are so cheap. Think of the cash/stock Netflix, Apple, Amazon have to scoop these up."
I am over joyed that Leon Cooperman is actively promoting this stock. It has given a big boost to our positions.
Seems to be dropping off highs like a lead balloon. I'm new to this short squeeze play...can anyone explain what's going on in lay terms? i.e. what's driving the wild swings?
This is trading beyond cheap. If it weren't for the debt load this would be a buy all day IMO
They announced they are buying back about 20% of the outstanding shares!
"maybe amcx is an acquisition target? after mom and discovery, are there any small entertainment studios left?"
"400%+ beat on earnings, small float, large short % and a company that has a sustainable business model covid or not! AMCX is a way better choice for an investment over AMC. If you wanna chase the momentum trade go to AMC. If you wanna invest stick around. But for those short! May wanna keep working hard to remind the reddit crowd this is the ""wrong AMC"" LOL. See ya tomorrow!"
"So are they going to be giving this stock away for free soon?Wait a minute, at these prices, they already are!"
"What’s up with this stock? Reddit isn’t attracted to the huge short? AMC is only 30% short, while AMCX is 93%"
"The upward pressure us too much! The shorts have nothing left to say other than wrong stock. Hahahah. Why. Because earnings have been great! Company is solid, and the short interest got out of hand! The makings of a great ride!"
Got to hold 46 this week (hopefully even higher) Some company has got to be looking at these guys
Only matter of time till word gets out on amcx short interest
3 BB in REV. 1 BB cash earning 8 bucks a share and only 2 bb market cap???? can you say triple!
"I miss Billray! Looks like you all showed up with your ""wrong stock concerns!"" Bahhahahahahaha"
"If I were to take a stab at it, I'd say VIAC is the likely buyer. Their stock has been trading sideways for 5 months and they probably want to make a move to change that. Not to mention the addition of AMC's content would make Paramount+ more appealing and allow them to compete better."
"This is NOT AMC Entertainment everyone. Feel free to invest in AMC Networks but it's not the same stock. Please take note, thanks."
good times
AMC MOVIE THEATRES. NOT AMCX. THIS IS THE WRONG STOCK.
"How Apple, Netflix, Viacom, Amazon or Comcast do not buy this company is crazy. Forget synergies and cost savings, the cash flow will fund the debt. Its a no brainer"
The CEO and COO step down within a couple of months. Not sure what Dolan is doing. Any thoughts????
"Looks like we are in the last days of AMC being an independent company. If this doesn't get bought out, I'm a monkeys uncle. Too cheap and a great asset for one of the larger conglomerates to own."
AMC+ is actually running at $8.99 whereas the other SVOD services they have are at a lower subscription price. That means that revenue would be much higher than the $329 million I quoted earlier.
"wow, this is getting smacked hard. from 73 to 48 in a day!It looks like this stock is now the subject of a short attack.probably some who were short AMC covered and immediately shorted AMCX expecting a stock drop on the ticker mix-up.Meanwhile AMC, which technically speaking, is NOT as good a short squeeze candidate as AMCX, is up 271% ! Lol.market is getting crazier every minute.We have already gone beyond the internet bubble at this point. I remember stocks running up 100% over several days or in rare cases in one day back in 1999 but this takes the cake.Powell and his criminal associates have turned the market into a complete chaos casino in order to provide wellfare to billionaires during a time of plague and economic collapse. Criminals."
"This should trend closer to 26.50...and that be a floor. We know they will buy back about 10M of the 40M outstanding...plus another 10M short, who should also know a floor is put in and cover. Also don't you think the company knows at this point how the quarter is shaping up? Best to get this knocked out before they report blow out numbers and the stock goes up even more."
The only problem with this stock is that it makes money.
"From CFRA (target 28)""We see continued strong growth in the nascentsubscription-based streaming platforms (Acorn,Shudder, Sundance Now, UMC), with plans for animminent launch of a bundled streamingpackage (AMC+ and WE tv+). Also, recent shiftsin the revenue mix should bode well for reducedearnings volatility over the long term."""
"Amazon should be buying AMC Networks (AMCX) it’s makes more strategic sense, still profitable, strong cash flow that will pay off acquisition price, great marketing opportunities with Amazon prime . It’s trading at low share price approx $ 1 billion enterprise value . Wonderful brands , AMC, We entertainment , IFC, Sundance , BBC. They could be streaming channels as part of Prime Network . Someone should put idea in front of Jeff Bezos , he will get concept and leverage marketing opportunities."
Whoever bought thinking it’s the amc theatres stock 
"buy out news is no longer rumor .... trust me, it's happening... #inhollywood"
Can we get a $70???
Sold my share last month for $25.12/ shr. Locked in long term capital loss. May buy back in now that I passed 30 day wait period.
Can you see it? Walking Dead World! Universal Studios!
"AMCX has been on a sustained uptrend since November, when it broke above its previous $20-30 trading range and created a 50/200 SMA crossover. Last week it was oversold and touched its bullish trendline at $44.14, and has since been steadily pushing back up. There should be some minor resistance at $52, when it started its downtrend in 8-9/2019, but if it can keep pushing over $52, it should be primed to retest its $73 high from last month. Do you think it can break back above $73? After a long period of consolidation, it has been steadily building steam for the past 3 months."
so heavily undervalued they smoked earnings last quarter and they'll smoke them even harder this quarter with those amc+ sales. they smoked the amount of subscribers they were expecting last year.
"Longs, don't sell. This is setting up for a short squeeze."
"My post from 5 months ago “Time for AMC management to take this company private . Cheap financing, still decent cash flow, reduce public company expense . Demonstrate alternate platform strategy success 2-3 years from now and cash in on a sale. Just an observation from the sideline .” Unfortunately they own very little content outright to attract a premium buyout , they will buy back shares and hope to execute on alternate platform subscriptions to replace eroding cable / DBS revenues."
"Who cares about swing, this is a great company, they're implying buybacks, they're talking about a potential for more investments in the production and streaming field (just like they invested in Fubo Tv) and they are probably the only company with a unique plan of joining the streaming wars, through the back door, and it's working so far! Stop talking about a swing for a sec and hear what the management have to say"
"Great earnings report IMO and CFRA analyst lowers? At any rate, I’ve taken it as an opportunity to add shares."
"Listened to CNBC this am and realized dummies chasing AMC (good for them) were accidentally buying ACMX. They didn’t realize there was a difference between the movie theatre and the Walking Dead network. Stock was $71ish at open, bought 20 PUTS as fast as I could for $1.70 and closed at $8 when stock was $47.90 about 3pm. Quick $12,500 profit, wanted to hold till this hits $40 but too much free money to leave on table. Thank you GameStop!"
"The smallest bit of research and DD would tell you that everyone is buying AMC, NOT AMCX. Don’t get that mixed up...this mistake is costing everyone."
"Analyst on CNBC said he values movie houses at 10-15 times cash flow. I would think AMCX would that or more. But at 10 times, it would value AMCX at about $6.5 billion. Which is about a triple from here"
Looks like media companies are dead moneyBeen in Viacom ever since it crashed from $100 to $40. Gone into cardiac arrest.
"Even at these share prices they could still reduce another 4M shares with the remaining buyback authorization. At the rate they are minting cash, they should do so before the share price keeps climbing. On top of that half the float is short and with each year they earn $5.00-7.00 a share and that continues to build equity and book value by the day. Lastly they are advertising AMC+ all over their channels and across the cable providers. I almost expect we'll see a better number for subscriber growth there."
Are people buying the right stock here?We need you on AMC!
AMC+ app has CONTENT!!!! No idea they had such great content wrapped up in the offering... talking international content!
AMCX should be using their remaining authorization and repurchasing even more shares at these levels until that is exhausted because the shares are so cheap and it will help further drive EPS in the future.
AMC did 1 billion shares in volume in one day a while back. We are up 25% on AMCX on just over 1million shares. Whoa! Let that sink in
"We're on the way to the $40s and I'm still sorry I bought a little amount,But I'm almost doubling my money soon, which will be great :)"
"Is it all just a squeeze today any news? Up over 8% on double volume, just blew threw it's 50 day moving average, looks good but can't find any new news"
"The COO just stepped down. Not sure if he was ready or new interim CEO pushed him out. But either way, no buyout in the works, or he would have hung around and waited for a parachute. Not even sure why Sapan went to Vice Chairman when no permanent CEO was ready to take the job. I guess the COO didnt get the top job and left. Any thoughts??????"
It will be good when they reduce outstanding 25% this week. If the shorts didn't cover that will increase the short percentage too and I expect the company will continue with open market share repurchases. With each passing day they just keep cranking off more earnings and cash flow that can be added to that.
funny how people are buying the wrong one
"""We will continue to evaluate share buybacks on an opportunistic basis.""...taken from last CC....hope they will announce another bunch of share buyback soon"
Starting to wonder if it's the same person telling us it's the wrong stock! Bahahahaha. No way there are that many concerned financial advisors! But sure as heck there are that many people with short interest! Bahahahahaha
Wow Viacom making a takeover bid
The climb is real! Can we see $60 before close?? wouldn't that be fun to watch
It would also be amazing if AMCX had any remaining authorization and said screw it and was in the market buying back all the shares they could too to pile on these short funds too.
I think people mix this company up with amc theatres because this network isn’t bad and has great content library to shop around. It’s worth double it’s current market cap
AmC is funny... they won’t get much shares if they’re only willing to pay 26.50 max
MC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) reported quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.28 by 3.13 percent. The company reported quarterly sales of $654.00 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $606.04 million by 7.91 percent.
"$SBGI $TGNA $AMCX $VIAC $DISCA $SSPFollowing trade press reports late last week, the WSJ says big advertisers are now set to exercise cancellations options for Q3 network ad spending. Kantar Media shows weekly ad spend was down ~40% y/y throughout April. We think the upfront process is unraveling, and as we reported yesterday scatter pricing is also down considerably and could put advertisers in a position to push for 2020-21 upfront pricing that's down y/y and/or below scatter. The WSJ says marketers remain concerned about the economy, and about future programming (likely including both entertainment and sports). The article says new ad contracts will include more flexibility around easily cutting spend if a new wave of coronavirus impacts economic activity."
"Even Cheaper than last i wrote. How Viacom doesn’t buy AMCX and Lionsgate right now is beyond me. Both are cheap and add tremendous content, channels and studios Disney and Comcast should also be int he hunt."
"P/E is 8, 106% shares are held by Institutions, Blackrock owns 15% of AMCX. I don't think they are buying the wrong stock."
no more nibbling... loading time!
BUY AMC NOT AMCX - SQUEEZE IS AT AMC. MEDIA TRYING TO DIVERT BUYERS! PAY ATTENTION. $AMC $AMCX
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3738473-amc-networks-spikes-on-speculation-of-a-potential-sale-processWow!
Discovery and ATT warner media merging. Comcast and Viacom need to get bigger. AMC networks has to be in the mix. Its too cheap
One of the cheapest stocks in the market
"If you look at the history here, it looks like Amazon may still be around. Same news source who reported this, as before, so probably the last month a deal has progressed along towards finalization or end negotiation. Also if you look and see where the news hit a day before about AMZN and AMC the movie theatre chain, someone had that wrong. It makes a lot of sense for AMZN to not only pick up the content, but at 4-5 times earnings it's a good investment and they get the TV channels too. Just think if they rebranded it to Amazon Movie Channel. Lots of options activity so someone is positioning for something."
"yea right, $AMCX is supposedly trending of yahoo finance with the volume of (gasp!) 70K (yes, thousands) vs $AMC the movie theater company with volume of 18mln+ in the first two minutes after open"
"Is it true that AMCX owns MGM studios or a piece of MGM studios? Somebody, please reply. I have been unable to figure this out even in view of the fact that Amazon just coughed up $8.5B for it. I know now that Amazon ""bought MGM studios"", but nowhere Can I find who they bought it from."
People buying the wrong stock. AMC is up pre-market over 200%.
Is this the most undervalued stock after MOMO? Grab all the shares you can people while it is super cheap. Easy money ahead
Tick toc.... tick toc.
"Look how easily squeezed when ""accident"" it''ll go to 200 if they REALLY try and squeeze this!"
Just wait for earnings. They should be great Most of buy back will be factored in
"With so much merging and consolidating in media/streaming, it's surprising that AMC Networks hasn't been bought. Strong cash flow, decent channels, etc. and very cheap and low market cap compared to other media networks."
the FUD is real. AMC is NOT AMCXAMC is what you are looking for friends
"This business is basically 2 times EBITDA, 4 times cash flow and a forward PE of 5. Investors may not like management, the Dolans, whoever. But it is a cheap stock and screaming BUY"
"Hello ALL, this is now the new AMC conversations board. Since Yahoo has disabled the AMC board, we will now all communicate here."
"I think it's a matter when not if....just sit on your shares and wait, we will be surely rewarded"
Why is $AMCX trending on Yahoo Finance and not $AMC ? are they trying to trick people into buying the wrong stock ?
"Perfect Scenario: 1.Massive buyback completed at low price (23.20), 2.Panic sale along with enthusiastic bears shorting brings the price down the next few days 3.Volatile price fluctuation which traps a few bears but brings in more bears 4.Earnings released end of October -> Price rockets"
"Gamco, which is run by Mario Gabelli a shrewd value investor just had a filing of acquiring AMCX Stock. Coupled with the reduction of share count from the dutch auction, the short interest is still amazingly high and could rapidly fuel this stock to the upside further."
"Roll call: Who all are tendering your shares and for what price? I don't know why anyone would tender shares for less than 26.50, right?!"
AMCX is 94% Short and went from $72 to $48 a share yesterday. The shorts will need to cover. Join me in AMCX!
Wondering when analyst following AMC will upgrade stock for approx. $100 million tax savings in 2018
"AMCX is not AMC movie theatres!!! The right ticker for AMC cinema is simply ""AMC"""
Super cheap. Buy before earnings on May 7
Much easier to takeover now that they have so few shares outstanding. Excellent buy at this price. They bought the shares back for a good reason. The stock will soon be back to at least $30 a share when the short dust settles.
I sure miss this opportunity. A high short interest and growing earnings is the recipe for a great move up as we have seen.
Relentless. Looks like they intend to take this under 30 again - maybe by xmas. That will be a great xmas present and That's where I'll be loadin the boat. they love to destroy this stock I mean they LOVE to destroy it. But One day this gets bought out and the short interest turns this into a rocket headed into hyperspace. So you want to go BIG when they really smash it down.
Barrons articles which says AMCX is under valued and the stock goes down. I dont understand
"""Discovery said it plans to spend $20 billion on content per year within the new WarnerMedia deal — topping Netflix's $17 billion pledge (NFLX) and Disney's goal of $14 billion to $16 billion by 2024 (DIS)"" -Quote from Yahoo!Any large streaming provider looking to stay competitive should look into adding AMCX. Currently AMCX is trading at a market cap of $2.15B, which is 1/8 of what the streaming giants are planning to spend. AMCX has great content such as Breaking Bad, Better Call Sal, Mad Men, Walking Dead that have proven to be successful and would add nicely to any streaming library. Even a 50% premium would put AMCX at a $3.25B purchase, and is still a fraction of what the large companies will be spending to stay competitive. I never like to speculate on acquisitions, but the Discovery+ Warner merger makes this space even more competitive, and AMCX seems like a great candidate.Regardless, cash flow is strong and AMCX has found their customer niche with a low turnover rate in its SVOD subscribers"
Seems like a good time to buy. The stock is very cheap. I still feel like there is some confusion between this stock and AMC which is why I'm hesitating to initiate a position.
"AMCX makes way more sense than AMC. A lot less shares outstanding and 93% short, if they get ahold of this, could really fuel this one a lot higher, coupled with the short covering, which you'll see more of as they get daily maintenance requirements and/or forced covering"
Y’all are buying the wrong stock. If you want to make real money... it’s AMC not AMCX. Just saying 
All of you AMC reddit trades get out of here. AMCX is a profitable company and just posted strong cash flow with a strong earning beat.
Current PE for 2021 is 8.AMCX could double and it would be cheaper on a valuation basis than many other stocks.Nice there is a lot of short interest on AMCX.
Wrong stock. $AMC is the right ticker. There is no way this should be trending. Purposely trying to get people to buy this stock and not $AMC
Anyone else get their shares from the cablevion Cvc spinoff or am I the only old timer here?
"At 5.5 million monthly subscribers, that would be a little over $329 million in additional revenue."
so CNBC puts up $AMCX instead of $AMC and today AMCX hit $70 on 1.3 million volume and was a trending ticker on Yahoo. What a joke.
FUBO was up 35% today. AMCX has a good position of shares in FUBO from their investment before they were public. It's an added bonus of owning AMCX stock.
Breaking News: Amazon’s interest was in AMC Network not the theater chain. $AMCX spikes over 17% while $AMC plummets
"I am also puzzled by the low share price. Since the market bottomed on March 23, Vanguard's Total Stock Market index is up over 50%. ViacomCBS has more than doubled. Yet, AMCX is only up about 10%, with a recent earnings report that was encouraging. Also, according to Yahoo, more than 30% of the AMCX float has been shorted. What is the bear case for such a low share price and heavy short selling? I am long, but wondering if I am missing something. Thanks!"
Seems like the COO left because he didnt get top job. BUT I still dont know what all the executive changes mean?? What will happen. Is Dolan bringing in a friend as interim to make him wealthy after a buyout? He has a huge amount of shares. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY THOUGHTS?????
"So AMCX caught up wrongly in AMC crossfire? At any rate, I took advantage of the situation to buy shares near the close."
"With 5 million SVOD subscribers at $4.99 a pop, that is right at $300 million a year in revenue."
"It is pretty impressive how quickly AMCX is adding subscribers to their SVOD. Just 2 quarters ago, they were hoping for 3.5 to 4 million by the end of 2023 and they are now stating that they will be at 5 to 5.5 million by years end."
Looks like the market likes the news about new leadership. Probably means more takeover speculation.
"Certainly a good day today....have to wonder if Amazon isn't perhaps back at the table trying to acquire them for their content stream. Also the company seems to be on a rampage buying back and extinguishing shares, they did about 10% outstanding in the first 4 months alone. Grant it with their cash and earnings, they could really easily retire 50% outstanding if they wanted and it might be smart down at these levels as opposed to when the stock doubles. Short interest just adds more potential grind higher as well."
Looks like it might be time to head towards 50!
Basically trading at one time EBITDA now after stock purchase. Has to be the cheapest stock on market.
"This can easily get out of control very quickly with a big short squeeze. You know people were waiting to see how it opened and now starting to panic and come into the market, fueling it higher and higher"
"Looks like we don't have to wait too long for AMCX to buy itself out! Congratulations to all who sat through the volatility. ""AMC Networks Inc. (NASDAQ: AMCX) today announced that on September 16, 2020 it plans to commence a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer to purchase up to $250 million in value of its outstanding Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Shares”), at a price per Class A Share of not less than $22.50 and not greater than $26.50. """
Blue light special!Load the boat!
"Modified Dutch auction is Dutch for short squeeze - if momentum daytraders help us along tomorrow, we could see some big price action - the press release was strong, with no indication of weakness in their business!"
"Who wants to bet the momentum investors who have been running GME and then now found BBBY, find the high level of short interest in AMCX and pile in in droves since it pops up as one of the most shorted stocks."
Are some people confusing American Movie Classics (AMCX) with the movie theaters?
When do we start getting all the helpful people telling us this is the wrong AMC! LOL. I'm calling when we start running up through $60 thats when they return.
ENDING YEAR AT 36 WOULD BE GREAT
Apollo buying stations from Tenga.
Was on Reddit and asked why AMC and not AMCX? Only answer that made sense was there’s no fundamental recovery story for AMCX like there is for AMC. High short interest may not be enough. I guess we’ll see.
"Has anyone looked into the short squeeze potential. This traded 1.9M shares Friday and was up $6.29. If you use the last short figures of 16.25M shares short, that's effectively 8 days to cover and wouldn't take into account other buyers entering in the market, etc. Also with the increase in price, that's also another $105M in maintenance requirement that probably popped up for the shorts just in the last day alone, and could mean more covering or worse, forced covering by their brokerage firms. The potential for this to get out of hand very quickly is there. Even more so if the company used more of their $135M left on repurchases effectively making short interest an even higher percentage of outstanding, however that won't be public until they report, but there could be a lot less shares outstanding there too."
"my own price target: 46$didn't buy yet, will buy some (a little amount) at the 23$ mark, good luck everyone :)came here after I bought some viac and lionsgate shares, still believe amcx can do something with it's worldwide channels"
"Time for AMC management to take this company private . Cheap financing, still decent cash flow, reduce public company expense . Demonstrate alternate platform strategy success 2-3 years from now and cash in on a sale. Just an observation from the sideline ."
"You guys got the wrong AMC! We close above 8 today and we're going into the gamma squeeze! Class divide, what you want is AMC"
Double down shorts.
Hopefully MGM/Amazon deal puts AMCX in play
Nice little run these last couple of trading days.
VIAC is behaving similarly. I don't understand it.
"Honestly, if I were short AMCX now, I'd be covering in fear that the AMC crowd might realize AMCX is where they should be squeezing."
"$500 - $1000 stock, the time of hedge founds come to an end. Retail will dictate the price from now on..."
Do you think the Disney streaming news is bad for AMC as it may take subscribers away or good because AMC is more likely to get acquired by a larger streaming service now to compete against Disney+
Time to go invite the friends for the quarterly run up!
So amc said they’d pay up to 26.50 and holders bidded down the tender to below $23.20.. is that how the Dutch auction works?
Now we wait.
Fewer shares. Easier to acquire. Should easily be trading over 30 dollars a share.
I think its about time to get ready for our next run boys!
"They knocked this one down hard to totally wipe out all the call buyers over 60. It should sky rocket based on fundamentals but they will do everything in the power to stop it from going fast because they want all those calls bought by momentum chasers after the last run to expire worthless.Only thing that can foil there plan is some unexpected positive catalyst, some announcement from the company that puts this back in launch mode. Market manipulation is a sad reality. That's why you never buy options. Especially on value stocks like this, just keep adding to your share count steadily. That's how you get the big gains in the end."
So cheap. Bought 500 today. Up to 3000 shares
"I ran this company through a DCF. With their share buyback program and despite their relatively high debt (affecting WACC), they're trading at 18% of fair value.This obviously looks wrong and I'm trying to find the error, but even if you take a margin of satefy of 50%, it's still undervalued."
Melt up! Slow and steady until Marge calls a few people and positions begin to require closing.
AMCX already has $890 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter. Who says they can only do this type of buyback once?
Buyout stock and not much more. I predict this will be sold within a year! Perfect for amazon prime
Interim CEO on CNBC next
"Classic divide to conquer distraction. AMC = correct ticker. Look at the call options expiring today!! If AMC ends above $8 today, we might see a gamma squeeze on Monday. jmo not financial advicePS I love eating crayons =)"
So cheap. 3 times EBITDA; a little kore than one times leveraged cash flow; 3 times operating cash flow - should be a buyout just on financials - perfect LBO
Forward PE at 6. Unbelievably cheap. Dolans should take this private if they dont put it up for sale
nice gift before buyout
Still cheap at 7.7 forward PE. Great bolt on for Comcast. Cash Flow and synergies will easily pay for acquisition Dont understand how this is still independent. This and Lionsgate
With 15 years experience in stock market I can say that someone big is going to buy AMC. With this valuation they can easily make a few billions
"Whatever hedge fund(s) are short AMCX, you have to think they have to be sweating it now, after seeing GME and BBBY pop afterhours knowing that short busters are coming for AMCX too."
Your stock choices are your own to make ..but if you intended to purchase shares of the AMC MOVIE CHAIN ..then you bought into the wrong ticker ...AMC ENTERTAINMENT ..ticker AMC ...true home of the APES
Stock is extremely undervalued.
BUY $AMC (AMC Entertainment) not amcx (amc networks)
No cash rich buyers left. Looks like we will have to wait a few years for AMCX to buy itself out with buybacks.
"You AMCX holders should sell off and buy back in when all of the dust settles. This is up on volume due to the AMC scramble. When these guys realize their mistake, they are going to sell and move yo AMC. You should definitely be taking advantage of their mistake.You should realize a nice gain if you play it right."
"AMC Networks jumps after CTFN says adviser hired to explore sale Shares of AMC Networks (AMCX) are rising in afternoon trading after CTFN's Diane Alter published a report that the operator of a flagship cable network as well as other smaller television channels has retained Morgan Stanley (MS) as an adviser to explore M&A options, including a possible sale. The Fly notes that shares of AMC Networks previously had jumped on May 12 after CTFN's Alter reported that she was told by a banker and lawyer claiming to be familiar with the matter that the company was running a process to sell itself.Read more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3123193"
Bought back 23% of shares from Q1 2020. Super cheap. Great cash flow. Discovery should scoop this up. Add more content and more channels.
Can we get a $50!
One of the cheapest stock valuations in the market
Could the shorts have this shorted by mistake? Thinking it was AMC? Now need to cover!
Someone please get on reddit and talk them into the opportunity that exists here
AMCX does good revenue and makes money. This is prime for short squeeze. Wouldn’t be surprise to wake up one morning and see this in triple digit.
"Anyone notice short interest is up to 19.3M from 10.8M in the last month? Might explain why the stock has stagnated, but also might help a bunch when this starts moving the other way too. I expect the company will continue to be aggressive buying back more shares as well since they still have authorization and are cranking off 200M in free cash flow a quarter. At this pace they can buy back the whole company within a year."
AMCX is NOT AMC (https://www.amctheatres.com/) If you buy this thinking it's AMC theatres you've made a mistake
"If just the positions that are short were closed, where does that put the stock price?"
"This SSR list everyone is talking about, its AMC Networks $AMCX not AMC."
Was today’s action a short squeeze or was there news of a possible buy out or other news?
Amazing that this trades at 5.6X forward eps. On the CC they talked about major cash generation in 2018 due to the tax code change. Ok lets see a special dividend.......Any good news here we will wipe out that $53.50 wall of resistance
Do you think those that bought $AMCX know they bought the wrong stock? It's $AMC stock you want.
"Someone help me with these numbers published here on yahoo: it says the float is like 25M with 90% short as of Dec 15th. Seems like tremendous potential for a short squeeze, especially if buybacks were authorized again. I mean, to the moon..."
I had AMCX shares because I like the company. Had it before the AMC confusion. Stop telling people to sell this stock. It's a good value and nothing to do with the theater chain. It's still a great investment. It's just not a Reddit pump.
"3 dollars eps is 12 dollars a year, with a pe ratio of 15 it's about 180 dollars per share"
