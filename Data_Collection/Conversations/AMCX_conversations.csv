Looks like it might be time to head towards 50!
Forward PE at 6. Unbelievably cheap. Dolans should take this private if they dont put it up for sale
Time to go invite the friends for the quarterly run up!
no more nibbling... loading time!
It will be good when they reduce outstanding 25% this week. If the shorts didn't cover that will increase the short percentage too and I expect the company will continue with open market share repurchases. With each passing day they just keep cranking off more earnings and cash flow that can be added to that.
Can you see it? Walking Dead World! Universal Studios!
Can we get a $50!
"With so much merging and consolidating in media/streaming, it's surprising that AMC Networks hasn't been bought. Strong cash flow, decent channels, etc. and very cheap and low market cap compared to other media networks."
Got to hold 46 this week (hopefully even higher) Some company has got to be looking at these guys
Relentless. Looks like they intend to take this under 30 again - maybe by xmas. That will be a great xmas present and That's where I'll be loadin the boat. they love to destroy this stock I mean they LOVE to destroy it. But One day this gets bought out and the short interest turns this into a rocket headed into hyperspace. So you want to go BIG when they really smash it down.
Seems like a good time to buy. The stock is very cheap. I still feel like there is some confusion between this stock and AMC which is why I'm hesitating to initiate a position.
This is trading beyond cheap. If it weren't for the debt load this would be a buy all day IMO
Why is $AMCX trending on Yahoo Finance and not $AMC ? are they trying to trick people into buying the wrong stock ?
Now we wait.
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3738473-amc-networks-spikes-on-speculation-of-a-potential-sale-processWow!
One of the cheapest stocks in the market
Stock is extremely undervalued.
"If I were to take a stab at it, I'd say VIAC is the likely buyer. Their stock has been trading sideways for 5 months and they probably want to make a move to change that. Not to mention the addition of AMC's content would make Paramount+ more appealing and allow them to compete better."
Looks like the market likes the news about new leadership. Probably means more takeover speculation.
3 BB in REV. 1 BB cash earning 8 bucks a share and only 2 bb market cap???? can you say triple!
I think its about time to get ready for our next run boys!
"Amazon should be buying AMC Networks (AMCX) it’s makes more strategic sense, still profitable, strong cash flow that will pay off acquisition price, great marketing opportunities with Amazon prime . It’s trading at low share price approx $ 1 billion enterprise value . Wonderful brands , AMC, We entertainment , IFC, Sundance , BBC. They could be streaming channels as part of Prime Network . Someone should put idea in front of Jeff Bezos , he will get concept and leverage marketing opportunities."
Seems like the COO left because he didnt get top job. BUT I still dont know what all the executive changes mean?? What will happen. Is Dolan bringing in a friend as interim to make him wealthy after a buyout? He has a huge amount of shares. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY THOUGHTS?????
"AMCX makes way more sense than AMC. A lot less shares outstanding and 93% short, if they get ahold of this, could really fuel this one a lot higher, coupled with the short covering, which you'll see more of as they get daily maintenance requirements and/or forced covering"
The CEO and COO step down within a couple of months. Not sure what Dolan is doing. Any thoughts????
Tick toc.... tick toc.
Interim CEO on CNBC next
I would have to say that if there is any consolidation in the industry that this would be the number one company to go.
Looks like media companies are dead moneyBeen in Viacom ever since it crashed from $100 to $40. Gone into cardiac arrest.
"I think it's a matter when not if....just sit on your shares and wait, we will be surely rewarded"
"This business is basically 2 times EBITDA, 4 times cash flow and a forward PE of 5. Investors may not like management, the Dolans, whoever. But it is a cheap stock and screaming BUY"
So cheap. Bought 500 today. Up to 3000 shares
"Anyone notice short interest is up to 19.3M from 10.8M in the last month? Might explain why the stock has stagnated, but also might help a bunch when this starts moving the other way too. I expect the company will continue to be aggressive buying back more shares as well since they still have authorization and are cranking off 200M in free cash flow a quarter. At this pace they can buy back the whole company within a year."
"If you look at the history here, it looks like Amazon may still be around. Same news source who reported this, as before, so probably the last month a deal has progressed along towards finalization or end negotiation. Also if you look and see where the news hit a day before about AMZN and AMC the movie theatre chain, someone had that wrong. It makes a lot of sense for AMZN to not only pick up the content, but at 4-5 times earnings it's a good investment and they get the TV channels too. Just think if they rebranded it to Amazon Movie Channel. Lots of options activity so someone is positioning for something."
"Looks like we are in the last days of AMC being an independent company. If this doesn't get bought out, I'm a monkeys uncle. Too cheap and a great asset for one of the larger conglomerates to own."
Barrons articles which says AMCX is under valued and the stock goes down. I dont understand
"Even Cheaper than last i wrote. How Viacom doesn’t buy AMCX and Lionsgate right now is beyond me. Both are cheap and add tremendous content, channels and studios Disney and Comcast should also be int he hunt."
"Looks like we don't have to wait too long for AMCX to buy itself out! Congratulations to all who sat through the volatility. ""AMC Networks Inc. (NASDAQ: AMCX) today announced that on September 16, 2020 it plans to commence a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer to purchase up to $250 million in value of its outstanding Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Shares”), at a price per Class A Share of not less than $22.50 and not greater than $26.50. """
VIAC is behaving similarly. I don't understand it.
"The COO just stepped down. Not sure if he was ready or new interim CEO pushed him out. But either way, no buyout in the works, or he would have hung around and waited for a parachute. Not even sure why Sapan went to Vice Chairman when no permanent CEO was ready to take the job. I guess the COO didnt get the top job and left. Any thoughts??????"
