"What scares me about this stock is the feedback from hearing from some franchisees that their closures are really high and that management really doesn't offer them much support. This does jive with their net openings being so low and a huge miss to their original investor day guidance. Also, cars are getting more expensive and complicated to fix. After 3 times going to a Maaco to get my bumper fixed, my sensors never worked right because they just don't have the tech skill to fix the software in cars. And if you believe in electric, their oil change business will get hurt. I bought in shortly after the IPO but am almost all out now after doing a lot of research."

This all wrong S.Lucus
The numbers were awful... so much for recession resilient industry. Apparently spoke with franchisees and they are pretty awful to deal with... they nickel and dime their franchisees and the closure rates are really high.
"I missed the IPO price mark. I had too low of a price in so I said screw it, instead of chasing it I set a 27.50 and was happy to see it trigger. I like this one. Curious to see what it does."
Does this company own Roark Capital? Do you own the real estate when you buy stock in $Drvn?
"I sold a few days ago right under 28.00 glad I did. I’ll grab it back in the low 20s gut feeling here time to take some profits and wait. New ipo, earnings just came out no more big news. Let’s watch her now. I’m out."

Y'all should check out HCMC. Get in now. The volume is off the hood.
You gotta get this. I bought mine yesterday and it's really climbing. It's only been a couple of months since their ipo so you have a chance to grab it early. I was watching the summary page and every minute or two the price would move - mostly up.Get it while it's cheap!
Looks like a good one.
When it starts to get pumped it’s gonna go crazy!!

Still holding. X 1000 shates. Chilling. 100.00 stick in a year or 2.
Looks like a lot of people don’t understand the automobile repair industry. With over 40 years in the industry I’m running the other way. Good luck to all who stay.
