"The airlines have been so focused on COVID (and rightfully so) - but even if there is a recovery in air traffic - it appears fuel costs are going to really hurt the industry....Given COVID continues on, high fuel cost, and the fact these airline stocks are well off their bottoms - it is difficult to justify buying at this time. I like the airlines long-term - but I think now is a good time to sit on the sidelines - at least until fuel cost start to come back down."
Told all my Ohana clients this would plunge. More downside coming. Thank you Gov Ige !!!!
The ER was good. Earnings per share loss is shrinking far more than estimates. Rev going back up. Super good value play. Some profit taking for swingtraders etc. All in long back to $30 - $50. in a year or two.
"Hey KK, why is HA sinking today ? You think it's because of the strict cutbacks in the airline industry ? Gov Ige is mandating vaccinations throughout companies in the hospitality industry. Delta is scaring the pants off Hawaii residences. Shutdowns are coming !!"
"WITH ALL COVID19 TABLETS ( PILLS ) IN THE PROCESS OF BEING APPROVE AND MANUFACTURING COMING FROM MRK, OVGN, VRXT AND OTHERS POTENTIAL COMPANIES....HA GONNA FLY TO ITS HIGHEST PEAK Y'ALL...LOAD HER UP...ALOHA!!"

Fox news just announced Gov David Ige extended 14-day quarantine for Hawaii. Way to go Governor ! There goes HA stock to single digits.
"Wow! how HA keeps prowling upward, no word folks..."
"Congratulations to the world's biggest bag holders thanks to ige , please get out while you can, save yourself, clearly sales will take forever to return"
Governor Ige now encouraging all visitors to stay away from the islands until COVID cases are more manageable. Hospitals now exceeding capacity and alternative opportunities being explored to handle the large surge in cases.
"Possible inverted head and shoulders pattern with left shoulder on 07/19, head on 08/19, and right shoulder forming now."
The new variant is here ! And it's not the Delta variant. Vegas hotels are in panic mode. Other hospitality stocks are tanking. Vacations are being cancelled left and right.
20 DMA passed through 50 DMA on 09/20. 50 DMA turned up today.
"Iâ€™m in.. 10,000 shares at 18.65.."
Average down on price and accumulating more. HA will eventually rocket back to its highs.
Any idea why all the airline stocks are moving higher today when trip cancellations are escalating and future bookings are down? Kinda defies logic.
painful morning for HA
Rumor has it that Alaska Airlines will try to acquire Hawaiian within the next few months. Would be a strategic pairing and accretive from a financial perspective. At $40-45/share buyout would be a bargain for Alaska and a victory for long-suffering HA shareholders.
pineapple vomit this morning
"I hold almost 10k in shares, I just bought in another 1k. I feel americans are more comfortable traveling to Hawaii oppose international right now. Really, its Miami, Vegas and Hawaii. Im betting big that the end of year quarterly report will show nice profits. I see HA reaching $30/share by end of year. Im holding until $35-$40."
