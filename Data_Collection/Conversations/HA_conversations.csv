There you go: SOUTHWEST begins flights on March 17th from Oakland to Hawaii starting at $49 one way ...That's why.
"The climate looking ripe for M&A at these levels. Sure, poor summer execution was an immediate term headwind for the airline, but an airline at book value may turn a few heads, especially international airlines, trying to get access to US domestic market. Interested to see what may come of it. $HA in a similar position."
"Oversold, we have known for months Southwest was coming to Hawaii. 11000 a day fly from the mainland, it is just a ripple. I have owned for years since it was 5 but sold most a while ago knowing this day was coming, time to buy back. If anything, the extra publicity will translate to a great yeat"
Good report today:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hawaiian-holdings-1q-earnings-snapshot-212027699.html
Would anyone like to buy my tickets to the big island? Spectacular sound and light show going on!
"For what it's worth, I feel like this stock has been grossly undervalued for quite a while now. Maybe it's all due to speculation of the declining prices of Hawaii flights in conjunction with Southwest entering the market, but I view this as a hard buy until it's trading in the mid $40's. Their balance sheet is too healthy to be trading this low."
20% down in two days. Insane
Sorry no one can afford a Hawaii trip with a $600 Stimmy..
"For the first quarter of 2021, the Company reported a net loss of $60.7 million, and adjusted net loss of $190.6 million.The Company reported total revenue of $182 million, down 72% compared to the first quarter of 2019, on 49% lower capacity. After a slow start to the year, the Company experienced a rebound in close-in demand in North America in March 2021.The Company reported total operating expenses of $255.4 million, and operating expenses excluding non-recurring items of $402.7 million, down 33% compared to the first quarter of 2019."
"NOT trying to hype this- not my style..I just think we are soon going to see several mergers- The Industry is going to be forced to consolidate. Lots of economic damage has been done and the airlines even today are still bleeding losses. No pricing power, X % of business travel is lost lost forever, etc. So in terms of HA, the good news is they have an attractive market / planes / routes for a few partners. Would be a super fit for SW. Once one of the carriers merge it will ignite the others to act. Iv'e seen this movie before. JMHOAnd again, not trying to hype anything! D"
"Hawaii ranks 47th out of the 50 states with 643 cases and 17 deaths. How is Hawaii NOT prepared to handle new cases ? With the military hospital presence and local hospitals in place, how can Hawaii's health care be so undermined and broken ? Why has the Governor been so blind to the lack health care and welfare of the state ? I know one thing. If I run for governor of Hawaii, it would be a landslide victory."
"I can't imagine HA being a beneficiary of the stimulus bill. Other major airlines like UA, AA, LUV, etc yes because they're American aviation businesses but Hawaiian Airlines??"
>20 testing partners approved in Japan. Flights should start early November. Main problem will be onerous requirements to reenter Japan. Hopefully that can be modified for Hawaii travel. Our Japanese friends love Hawaii.

Check from day to day flight prices from now till end of December and you'll know that talking about. Filling up booking more and more with prices increase daily.
"Add to the fact LAX to HNL already has 16 non stops a day, adding a 737 to the mix is not going to change pricing"
"if we can hold and close at $28.10 today, we can see $29 in coming weeks (technically speaking)... enjoy the ride"
The big winner in the 737 max 8 is HA
Just be patient will fly high in June
"Just sold half, had to. Awsome day."
Sold a thousand shares at 4l and kept 3000; sometime it is good to let go.
"HONOLULU, April 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Airlines is offering its loyalty members a lifetime of flexibility to earn, save and redeem HawaiianMiles by eliminating its mileage expiration. In celebration, Hawai'i's hometown carrier is inviting travelers to participate in an ""Endless Hawai'i"" sweepstakes for a chance to win 1 million HawaiianMiles* – the equivalent of 16 roundtrip flights between the U.S. mainland and Hawai'i."
No one is heading to Hawaii on October 15. Just saw on Hawaii news Most hotels will still be closed until at least November 20 and the outer island are requiring second tests and quarantine for 3 days in the resort bubble. Add to that Expedia said today rates will be the same and I guarantee you there will be a covid fee on you bill at checkout. HawaiI is my second home and I go back 3 times a year and lived there 15. At this rate doubt I’ll ever go back just saying.
oversold.. P/E is down to 5. I bought 500 share before the close today. let's see where it goes from here..
I have held a position for a long time but with the wild swings I now have been day trading a portion but will hold my core long term.
HA share price will be low until Gary Kelly tells the truth about profitability to Hawaii. It is not but Kelly won’t admit it 
"$XSPA if you honestly think $JBLU $UAL $HA $DAL and KLM airlines would partner with us and we arnt a big deal in the testing space I dunno what to tell you. We are obviously trusted and crucial for recovery or they wouldn't have partnered with us. We are in almost every major airport already with more opening mid February and start of March. Testing testing testing in the news daily, specifically in airports. There will be new protocols to flying similar to the changes after 9/11. I think testing is here to stay for a long time especially when it comes to international travel"
"Acclaimed Labs used our fully automated data forecasting software to predict/forecast Hawaiian Airlines would generate $658 Million in Passenger Revenues for 2Q18. Actual passenger revenues came in at $655 Million, a difference of only $3 million. We have been predicting Hawaiian Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Jetblue passenger revenues with institutional grade results for many years. I've forecasted Hawaiian Airlines (HA) passenger revenues again, this time including a bit further out: 3Q18 $695 million up from 3Q17 of $634 Million, 4Q18 $663 Million up from 4Q17 of $597 Million1Q19 $661 Million up from 1Q18 of $611 Million2Q19 $700 Million up from 2Q18 of $655 Million I can forecast nearly any monthly or quarterly time series data for airlines and investment banks looking for a competitive advantage to forecast financial fundamentals better, faster and with automation. My data forecasting software technology solution uses open source and runs thousands of models, computations and algorithms in high speed, discarding some models and optimizing others, forming the best statistical based forecasting software for demand planning and financial fundamental predictions."
"United's conference call was a bit of a circus and has thrown airlines into a major funk today. There were hints of pricing pressures going forward, which some think may lead to the pricing wars that used to occur regularly in this business and made the industry an investing minefield for years. Let's hope we're not going back down that path. I continue to hold HA, like their Hawaii niche, as island style is timeless."
Hope my patience will be rewarded today...
"Other airlines have come and eventually go or if they plan on staying, their prices will creep up after they realize that doing business in Hawaii is tough especially with the operational costs. Hawaiian is set and monopolizes the island market and has been for years that I been there. We will see."
Stock suddenly up! Southwest decide not to add flights to Hawaii?
panic selling today. Is there dilution around the corner?
"Now there's one...GLTA...HA took over Islands key slots...Island Air has shut down after 37 years in the sky.The airline, which had run flights between the Hawaiian islands since 1980, posted on its website and social media accounts Thursday that it is no longer accepting reservations and would cease operations on Nov. 10. The company had filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 16 after years of financial troubles.“I want to thank Island Air for its decades of service to our communities,” Gov. David Ige wrote in a statement. “The closure will have a tremendous effect on 400 employees and their families, and the state will be working with Island Air to help the employees apply for unemployment insurance and provide assistance with job searches and training opportunities.”Island Air was known for flying at lower-than-average altitudes, to give passengers better views of the Hawaiian scenery. Its closure gives Hawaiian Air, already the largest airline in Hawaii, an even greater share of the local market."

"Well run company, CEO is steering company well in these turbulent times and we should see the stock price curve upwards, my best guess is mid-may."
"I imagine we'll see a decent bump if they decide to allow travelers to bypass the Quarantine if they get the Covid Vaccine. Once the vaccine starts getting distributed to the masses, we wouldn't have to deal with the whole ""Get a test AND have the results within 72 hours of arrival"" mess."
"I really want to buy a few hundred shares in this. The only thing stopping me is the fear that the ""Re-Opening"" of Hawaii Tourism will be delayed yet again.I might just sell some puts on it to make a little dough while waiting for some more news on whether or not Oct. 15th is the big day."

No Max 8/9. Hawaiian has no Max 8 in their fleet and they have none on order.
NV Gov Sisolak will announce today at 3pm PST the opening of Las Vegas casinos. People will start booking hotel reservations and airline flights from Hawaii. Flights will be discounted on top of rooms at bargain prices. Watch the flight bookings start to book up starting tomorrow !
Looks like a solid beat !! Hawaiian should be up nicely Wednesday :) :)
"Hawaiian has been in previous price wars over West coast routes, and when the dust settles comes out with the same or higher market share. There are a couple of reasons for this which the airline analysts seemingly ignore in their forecasts. Who do you think is smarter: Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, or Blackrock and Vanguard?"
"Looks like you can kiss summer travel to Hawaii goodbye. 14 day quarantine being extended until June 30th and the state and local governments are increasing patrols of those who still decide to visit. With other states opening up and an expected increase in cases nationwide, how could a island state with an inadequate health care system open up? If you bought in during the drunken run up after they took the government cheese, strap in, it's going to be a bumpy ride."
"Last year, I flew from LAX to OGG (Maui) via Virgin America (operated by Alaska Airlines). It was the worst flight I ever took, and I've been flying since the 1950s. It was like flying in an overcrowded box for 2500 miles, with bare minimum cabin service."
the fact is people are flying domestically and very soon the international flights also picking up... and more to hawaii!!!
"Completely Insane: P/E = 5.0, Return on Equity = 42%"

"Effective today, fully vaccinated visitors from the mainland are not required to take a Covid test or quarantine. Age below 5 are exempt from testing . Age 12-6 will need to have a test done prior to arrival"
"People...stop listening to the negativity and crazy far fetched predictions on here. They just want to get you to sell or not buy because if the stock price goes down, they make money. HA will be just fine. Inter island flights are running again and full. Once quarantine is lifted, the first place people will go is Hawaii. especially because there aren’t really choices for Americans to travel anywhere else since other countries plan on banning us. Buy and hold and you will make money."
"Hawaiian is getting the smaller planes so most people will fly direct. Interisland flights are underpriced, its not going to hurt Hawaiian. The question is how does the southwest, no meal, no entertainment, no reserved seat compare with hawiian on a mainland flight. Not real great."
Seems like airlines got a overdue bump as a whole. Now with the bullish news regarding Japam travel should send HA higher. We shall see how that goes.
Beat earnings expectations handily.
Just got done watching the head of HA and Outrigger hotels on an interview. Here’s the round up. Current passenger at 25% of last year. Planes at 50 to 60 percent capacity due to less flights. Hotel occupancy up 10% as of oct 15th. Expect to be at 20 percent by March and if all goes well 45% by end of 2021. HA down from losing 3 million a day to 2.2. HA looking to fly from all 13 states soon but there are concerns with rise in the rona and possible quarantines on passengers returning to the states. That has been a big issue with the Japan flights. Inter island flights are few due to cost of testing being more than flight according to HA.

HA is always fun to play if you are patient.
Strong balance sheet and government help. HA and JBLU are my two airline stocks.
"Position yourself, foreseeing $45-$60 end of year range folks..."
"Alaska Air just upgraded to strong buy - Raymond James. ALK is HA's main competitor on west coast flights to Hawaii and will compete with Southwest, maybe even more than HA. Main rationales for the upgrade:(1) compelling risk-reward following the 22% pull back in shares since the late October earnings report (vs. -4% for U.S. airline peers); (2) Alaska’s recent material paring of 1Q18 schedules in select (weakest) markets; (3) signs of, albeit very modest, improvement in transcon/intra-CA pricing; and (4) likely limited downside to investor sentiment.(doesn't even mention Southwest...)"
"Thanks for the downgrade; just bought 10,000 shares @$22.91!"
Be buying HA right now while it’s being held down because this baby ain’t slowing down anytime soon. Southwest should have moved in 10 years ago
Any idea why all the airline stocks are moving higher today when trip cancellations are escalating and future bookings are down? Kinda defies logic.
"U.S. airlines could ground themselves..Mar. 23, 2020 10:26 PM ET| |By: Clark Schultz, Major U.S. airlines are prepping plans for a potential voluntary shutdown of passenger flights across the U.S. if air traffic controller staffing emergencies continue to crop up or demand falls much further, according to The Wall Street Journal.It's also still on the table that the federal government could at some point halt all U.S. flights in an effort to deal with the pandemic.Air traffic is already at a minimal level, with the TSA reporting a drop of 80% on Sunday compared to the same day a year ago."
Why should anyone be expected to take a covid test to go to Hawaii? Emperor Hiro Ige must remember that in the USA travel can not be stopped at the state line. Goofy boy Ige should have spent the last 3 months preparing his health care system.
This looks very tricky fundamentally and technically. If existing conditions persist I can see this drifting to 14
Stock performing well going into Earnings release in few hours. Let’s break through $35!
Pristine balance sheet; best buy among all airlines!
"Moody's: Maintains Hawaiian's Ba3 Corporate Family Rating, reflects the expectation that the company will sustain its strong credit metrics from the reduction of funded debt since 2014. Moody's expects Hawaiian's margins to improve in 2019..."
how is this even possible?
"Welp. There goes my bet that HA would bounce bigly today.Almost bought stock a few weeks ago thinking the 15th would be a good day. Bought super cheap calls instead, so a small loss overall.Oh well. Maybe November will be a better bet?Still think HA will bounce in the long term."
Rumor has it that Alaska Airlines will try to acquire Hawaiian within the next few months. Would be a strategic pairing and accretive from a financial perspective. At $40-45/share buyout would be a bargain for Alaska and a victory for long-suffering HA shareholders.
Anyone know if earnings are before or after the bell? Can't find it.
There's an old Civil Aeronautics Board law called public convenience and necessity. HA was built on local traffic. Too much importance placed on tourism. Hawaiian community includes West Coast USA. Calendar charts reflect uptick summer traffic.

Earnings of $4.62 per share. HA should be soaring after hours. PE of 10 would put HA at $46. Why such a low stock price?
Has anyone else noticed that Ige talks like Elmer Fudd?
"The only airline to come out of crisis bigger and stronger will be skyw. 4 airlines went under and skywest was given all the routes from boutique, transStates, expressjet and compass. Positive earnings yesterday and beat on eps and revenue. Low debt and almost a billion in cash, book value is over 50"
The new variant is here ! And it's not the Delta variant. Vegas hotels are in panic mode. Other hospitality stocks are tanking. Vacations are being cancelled left and right.
Any news?. Big dump on volume.
Hawaii will announce reopening within 48 hours. Likely target date is August 1st. They are facing pressure from the Feds. Lockdown violated the US constitution.

This is rolling back to 15 where it belongs.. CA shutdown is hurting Hawaii
Why the decline today? Earnings going to be bad?
"Hawaiian Holdings Inc. provided an improved second-quarter revenue outlook Tuesday, citing continued ""strong demand"" in its North America market. The Hawaiian Airlines parent said it now expects revenue to decline 42% to 46% from the same quarter in prepandemic 2019, compared with previous guidance for a 45% to 50% decline. The company also said it now expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent expense (Ebitdar) to be down $40 million to $10 million from a year ago, an improvement from its previous guidance for a decline of $70 million to $20 million. Separately, the company raised its outlook for fuel price per gallon to $1.87 from $1.75, but affirmed its capacity outlook for a decline of 30% to 33%. The stock, which fell 0.8% in premarket trading, has run up 43.2% year to date through Monday, while the U.S. Global Jets ETF has rallied 17.6% and the S&P 500 has gained 11.7%."
"Reasons this stock going much lower: -Hawaii is not opening up anytime soon with the spikes in Covid cases on the mainland, HA makes the majority of their money on domestic flights to Hawaii. Also, Foreign travel, may not open to Hawaii for an extremely long period and HA does of a lot of those flights as well..-HA burning about 4 mill per day.... How long can this go on??-Large hotels are not opening till at least Oct now..-Earnings are going to be worst in company history.. (Expect a huge drop in HA stock price, the day they are released) -The Southwest affect has hurt HA and has not been reflected in their stock price to this point (this will likely intensify as consumers are more price conscious after Covid) -The recent outbreak in Hawaii was due to HA employees -Huge layoffs coming for HA and the CEO will be pushed to lobby for more Gov $$$"
If you live in Hawaii you would understand that this state does not have the luxury to keep the unemployment rate this high. No vaccine has been made. As a resident who understands this industry very well. There is no way that Hawaii can sustain this level of unemployment.I'm suprised they held out this long. Federal airport workers are being called back to work.
Going green today. So many considerate ppl on this board screaming sell #Ha 
"""Hawaiian said it’s ready for the challenge, citing 170 daily flights between islands. A last-minute ticket for Friday on its popular Honolulu-Kona route would be cheaper than a Southwest fare between Austin, Texas, and Houston, a trip of similar length"", said Peter Ingram, Hawaiian’s chief executive officer.“Southwest’s PR strategy has been to toss out tidbits without much detail, so it’s unclear what kind of service or operation they are committing to,” Ingram said in an emailed statement."
Yes yes!
"Just when it looked like HA stock price was regaining strength, it plummets today. Makes no sense given the strong earnings report and guidance. Way undervalued. Guess the sellers think otherwise. Something's odd about this though."
"In the meantime, how many people get thrown out of their apartments before Aug 1? Evictions, BK's, Chapter 13's, etc. July will be a dark month in Hawaii."

"Flying from Hilo to Honolulu then Honolulu to Long Beach Ca last week. HA owns the airports in Hawaii.

Wouldn't want to be in Hawaii right now. Delta is hitting family and friends throughout. Scary time when you thought is was contained. Ninth Island is taking a beating in the hospitals. Hard to get an appointment at medical facilities. It's happening folks !
Great news about traffic and the stock drops??Wish I could buy more
"Hawaii is struggling.. my neighbors went every year almost. They haven’t been in 3 years. My coworker goes every year, he took his wife to Mexico instead"
I would only fly HA to Hawaii.
whys is travel lagging the TSA figures generally and why Hawaian in particular? It's not even hugely dependant on business travel?

Congrats on those who held this through thick & thin.....you can step up and receive your rewards!
This makes no sense at all...all the travel related stocks are crashing....why??? Travel is booming.
Fox news just announced Gov David Ige extended 14-day quarantine for Hawaii. Way to go Governor ! There goes HA stock to single digits.
"Wish I could buy more HA shares at this price, but already have invested in HA twice as much as in my second largest investment."
"With an absurdly low $1.3 billion market cap, HA is now priced as if the world is coming to an end. It’s not folks. Southwest entering HA turf is not the epic threat the doomsayers would have you believe."
HA is lagging because of three major points: 1. Asian travel is shut down 2. Delta variant is now a domestic concern 3. Valuation was steep in this stockThe selloff is justified and resents a good entry point at this level
"Ok... let's remind ourselves HA is now trading below P/E 6, cheapest among its peers. Let's get this back up to $30 for crying out loud...."
so I read the earnings call and it sounded like they released more stock on the market to raise money. If that is true then it is not the bargain it looks like. I have been following them since COVID started and I did not see any clues that they were issuing extra shares. I thought they said they raised 41 million this way. So the pre COVID share prices can't be compared to the diluted stock prices now. BUMMER.
"I'm not a big fan of the new tax plan, but this should be a positive for HA whose tax rate is generally in the range of 36-37%. The new 21% tax rate will be huge for HA and I don't think it's reflected in the stock price yet. Best of luck HA longs."
"Yahoo shows analyst estimates for HA profits 5 bucks something in 2019, 4 bucks in 2020. The guys that study these things seem to feel Southwest will have an impact but not a dire one. I'm encouraged by that. A PE of 6 AFTER the impact of Southwest seems like a screaming buy to me."
Get real Daniel. HA is a losing proposition. You must be a desperate paid pumper. All my Ohana friends are flying SWA at $159 a way with 2 free bags to the mainland. HA still overcharging the locals. Look at their losses ! Can't fill the planes compared to SWA. Now look at SWA SP. Big difference buddy.
"WTI down 4.25%, HA down 1.5% and trading at a TTM PE substantially lower than EPS....maybe some money from the NFLX knobheads could flow into profitable companies? Just saying "
"Wow! how HA keeps prowling upward, no word folks..."
Why is stock so cheap relative to earning? Debt doesn’t look bad. Is there a worry about competition from Southwest?
"Moody's upgrades Hawaiian Holdings debt: The upgrade in ratings reflects the expectation that Hawaiian will sustain its current strong credit metrics, which have benefited from the reduction of funded debt by about $475 million through 2017 and meaningful margin expansion that led to cumulative free cash flow of about $600 million since 2014. Debt to EBITDA has ranged near 2x and Retained Cash Flow to Debt at or above 30% since 2016, which provide some cushion at the Ba3 rating for potential competitive and or cyclical pressures. Moody's expects Hawaiian to continue the good operating performance of recent years, marked by operating and EBITDA margins above 20% and 30%, respectively and limit re-levering of the balance sheet. However, there will be some margin compression in 2018 with sustained higher oil prices. Nevertheless, the company's margins have been and we expect will remain near the top of the 21 airlines Moody's rates. The upgrade also reflects Moody's view that the execution risk in the fleet plan is now manageable, with almost half of the A321neos in service."
Tomorrow will be a good day for airlines and SAVE. Stimulus to be confirmed and investors will realize gross overreaction to mutated virus.According to surgeon general. Virus constantly mutates and there is no evidence that this mutation is immune to vax so what’s the big deal?
Bought back under $40. Never expected to come down this much.
"Dirt cheap in terms of price to earnings. Unlike SAVE, this one beat on earnings by a mile, and is cash flow-positive. I love their ties to Japan also. The recent interview with the CEO was excellent too. He made several excellent points. I think somebody will either buy them out of there will be a merger at some point."
"You want to 'experience ' Hawaii, Fly Hawaiian. You want to 'experience ' Texas, Fly Southwest."
P/E very good.
I bought at 13ps just a few months ago & feeling good about long future!
"In at 26.30 this AM, here's to a swift and orderly rebound to last week's range."
Try booking a flight to Maui or Oahu in Nov or Dec on HA website!!! All full!!! Lol.. no one cares about last quarter..
"Any shareholders of CVS ow WBA, or KR here? This HA Southwest situation reminds me of the ""OMG AMAZON is coming"" stock plunges & purges of earlier this year!"
"Ugh,...Have 6000 shares for a while...So far has been a bad bet... What can I say...Holding...D"
"Beat Hawaii postings: ""Southwest cancelled Flight 5700, HNL-OAK. They stranded all of their passengers with no rescheduled flight yet.""""This is exactly what I feared. My pocketbook hoped it would be a successful venture for Southwest but, I’m willing to pay a couple hundred dollars more for the safety of well established routes on Hawaiian or Alaskan. Hawaiian is worth it just for the aloha they convey from the second you walk onto the plane. I enjoy their style, the music, and the free meal with a free glass of wine. The seats are cozier and the colors are calming. It’s truly the full Hawaiian experience flying Hawaiian."""
No worries Hawaiian .. we going fly
"Why is the stock price so weak when the business is strong? For example, May traffic statistics all up today, and stock down again."
Can’t afford Hawaiian vacay with 300 unemployment supplement. Need 600 supplement. Welcome socialism so HA can be profitable and pay huge taxes on its profits. What’s the point now anyway. Sell all your stocks and just let us smoke weed and cash gvmt checks
"Late yesterday large shorts were selling HA into the close, knowing the traffic revenue report was coming - what were they thinking?... HA is going to be fine, and any surprises this year will likely be on the positive side..."
"Hay Mark, we are almost at $25."
GREAT NEWS. ON CNBC NOWTravel to Hawaii open Aug 1 with no quarantine. When you get a test before you go. Per Josh Green LT Governor of Hawaii. $UAL; $AMR: and others will not be the same business as Hawaiian Airlines.
Hawaiian is up 6.30% to 20.91
“Now switching gears to demand. We're encouraged with our inbound load factor from North America to Hawaii running at 57% in the first 10 days since we reopened the state. Bookings for the fourth quarter have steadily improved as travelers gain confidence in the state reopening.”
This stock is a coiled spring. Not clear exactly when it will shoot upward.... but it will. Acquiring shares under $20 is the way to go.
Seeking Alpha Summary:The market has punished Hawaiian Holdings as if they've already lost significant market share and revenue to Southwest and UnitedContinental.Hawaiian Holdings' balance sheet is in remarkable shape and the company is buying a lot of shares at these distressed prices.Analysts' 2018 earnings per share estimates make no sense.

Havent reviewed HAIs it a good buy at 11.5?Can it make it through this crisis?
"In the second week of Hawaii’s pre-travel testing program, visitor arrivals fell 25% compared with the first week."
"""Vaccinated mainlanders will be able to skip COVID-19 testing and quarantines in Hawaii once the state hits a 60% vaccination rate, according to Hawaiian Gov. David Ige. Once 70% of Hawaiians are fully vaccinated, the state will drop all travel restrictions and sunset its Safe Travels program.As of June 7, 53% of Hawaiians were fully vaccinated and 60% had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Hawaii's health department. In theory, travel restrictions could begin to ease within weeks if everyone follows up with a second dose of the vaccine."""
"It would not surprise me that South West never flies to Hawaii except for some token flights.To much competition, price of oil all over the place, lack of ground support on Hawaii. They may fly but may never make any money."
"Friday's coordinated airline short fails*A group of shorts thought that significant airline insider selling in February, combined with the decline provoked by increasing bond yields on Friday, was a very good sign to sell airlines. By 11:30 eastern, the trend reversed after realizing that since over 50% of U.S. 65 year olds have been vaccinated, the Covid-19 mortality rate was effectively cut by 40%. *This is just my opinion of course.$JETS $ACDVF $AAL $UAL $LUV $JBLU $DAL $ALK $SKYW $HA $CJT.TO $ALGT $TXT $GD $RYAAY $WIZZ.L $0753.HK"
I sold 1000 shares too soon; now I am itching to buy it back.Lets be patient for one more drop.
Hawaii's 14-day quarantine extended to 8/31. Preboarding testing in lieu of quarantine is not an option yet.
I want to get in for 600 shares at $22 for a long term hold
My friend who is a DL pilot shared with me in the past couple of weeks they are eyeing a buyout of HA
Airline stocks up in the green but HA is still flying in the red. Even with the announcement that Vegas _ Hawaii flights have started up again. No thank you ! Gov Ige ruined our islands !
All Americans will be vaccinated by July.... Summer travel will be in high demand....Buy the Airlines!!!!Heading back to pre COVID-19 levels...The TravelWar will be massive stimulus for all economic reforms....#AAL #UAL #BA #LUV #JBLU #DAL #MESA #ALK #SKYW #HA #^DJI #^IXIC #APPL #GOLD
"Hey KK, why is HA sinking today ? You think it's because of the strict cutbacks in the airline industry ? Gov Ige is mandating vaccinations throughout companies in the hospitality industry. Delta is scaring the pants off Hawaii residences. Shutdowns are coming !!"

CEO stepping down... #Bearish
Expect CEO to call the bottom on earnings call this week.Will suggest unanticipated demand going forward for HI travel. Shares are going to pop.
this is about to break out. back to 60 by july 2019
"Congratulations to the world's biggest bag holders thanks to ige , please get out while you can, save yourself, clearly sales will take forever to return"
"Based on how this trades this will shoot up to 20 when Hawai’i reopens with testing Oct 15th. Bullish for now, but watching Ige closely"
If you got the money BUY some. All depends on a COVID Vaccine and little to none COVID restrictions but the government is not going to sit by and let a plane load of airlines BK. If this recovers and can get back on track by 2022 and contain losses for the rest of this year and 2021 this has massive upside. 20%BK/80% No BK
I got out at 40 as usual but it moved higher this time. Good for longs!
HA is a $50 stock masquerading as a $37 stock. It’s only a matter of time before the market wakes up and realizes the huge disconnect between HA’s intrinsic value and its stock price.
"HA overbought so we have a few down days. Might decline to middle of the Bollinger Band $29-$30 range. Earnings on Tuesday January 29 might move the stock either way a lot. Trend is up, seems to me."
"Hmm wonder who's in the market for a cheap pacific airline..? ""double-downgrade"" hah. This one just jumped the front of my list of take-over candidates."
"8000 Folks Flew Into Hawaii 1st Day It Reopened! I have the Call Options and Just Bought 1,100 Shares!"
"Low fuel prices -- much lower today than a few months ago. HA with a PE under 5. Other airlines PE around 10. HA tanked due to a small decline in load factor, despite overall increase in revenue. HA will go up big early 2019 -- my prediction."
Every short in the Airlines has hit the panic button....#AAL #UAL #BA #LUV #JBLU #DAL #JET #MESA #ALK #SKYW #HA #^DJI #^IXIC
"Actual 2Q18 Passenger Revenues for Hawaiian Airlines (HA) was $655 million against my technology's $655 million prediction. My fully automated data forecasting technology predicted this 3 months in advance, with no advance ticketing data, planners, analysts or data science teams. Institutional grade results. I've ran a new forecast for Hawaiian Passenger Revenues for 3Q18 - $695 million - up around 9.8% year over year (yoy)."
Friends came to visit from Hawaii. Flights still expensive. Better to use SW airlines. They don't charge for baggage like Hawaiian. You'll save $120 for two bags on SW. Still have to take a covid test to return back to islands. Another expense. I'll save with Southwest.
The new strain is taking over rapidly. Shutting down casino hotels. Beefing up security. Restaurants closing down permanently. More layoffs coming to Vegas hotels. WYNN starting mass layoffs Jan 11. Calif is a ghost state. Hospitals are 110% full. The country is going under. Just what China ordered.
"Easy government money sitting out their for HA. They'll have to issue warrants, but may as well take the cash as an economic buffer. This effort should raise the stock price."
HA management needs to do more to protect the stock price from this senseless plummet. I still think a strategic partnership with Jet Blue would be in the interest of both airlines.
Nice to see HA showing some signs of life. Still way undervalued and should be trading in the mid-40s. But at least it's moving in the right direction.
"Despite the volcanic activity, HA business is strong. HA undervalued and due for a 50% rise. Some folks are booking flights to see the volcano in action. The 5% drop today will be erased in the next week. HA taking flight to $40s starting today,"
nice to see it rebound from $25... HA needs a stronger IR effort to promote company and stock!

HA's stock price flatlined at about 11:30 and hasn't changed for 3 hours. There appear to be trades going on. This is weird. Does anybody know what is the deal?
Did we just see the bottom? I added more.
"Hawaii folks need to start rallying against the Mayor and politicians that are holding the state hostage. Look at Vegas. Tuesday, Gov Sisolak will announce the opening of casinos on June 4. The hotel casinos in Calif, Arizona, Wash and more are all opened and the videos are astonishing. Social distancing and masks are required. Cars are backed up for miles. And Hawaii is still on a 14 day lockdown ?? The race is over for those politicians in Hawaii. Remember is time. You'll see the Republican Party take over the state."
HA will be down to $18 this week. Watch and learn boys.
"WITH ALL COVID19 TABLETS ( PILLS ) IN THE PROCESS OF BEING APPROVE AND MANUFACTURING COMING FROM MRK, OVGN, VRXT AND OTHERS POTENTIAL COMPANIES....HA GONNA FLY TO ITS HIGHEST PEAK Y'ALL...LOAD HER UP...ALOHA!!"
"Earnings not to bad, in fact, it’s excellent vs other airlines. 2nd Q maybe worst, but the rebound in travel for Hawaiian will be fast. Lots of people still want to come to Hawaii. I’m surprise aftermarket HA is not up stronger!"
"Be careful people. Read this from another message board.PLEAZE LIKE THIS COMMENT TU PUSH IT TO THE TOP OF PAGE !! VERY IMPORTANT TO HELP NEWBIES OR PEOPLE DOSEN'T UNDERSTQND WHAT HAPPENING !!I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause NAKD. AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29."
"I'm so bullish on HA. Don't let the shorts tell you otherwise. They don't even live or see the statistics in real time. They're just going off technical analysis and whatever news they see.Large institutions, big money, and Hawaii residents all know hospitality and tourism has to resume in Hawaii. Left or right doesn't matter. We are talking strictly economics."
"Its a painful game...No such thing as easy money...Yes, I am long HA and today is so far another bad day. Just holding. Not a day trader and have seen this type of scenario a thousand times over. The funds and MM band out the sheep and buy on the cheap. They know exactly how to play on peoples fears and are experts at it.. No reason I can see for todays move. Just another day in the painful game...D"
"Just released, Acclaimed Labs posted this as a reply to another older message, posting here again as they have been one of the most accurate in forecasting airline revenues; the full forecast for Hawaiian Airlines for 4Q18 - 3Q19 Passenger Revenues: https://acclaimedlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hawaiian-4Q18-PREV-Forecast.pdfThey are also forecasting total Q4 Revenue of $738m vs. current analyst expectations for $715m."
"The important factors are load factor, revenue per mile, fuel price and dollar. Overall revenue does not matter so no Japan is not an issue. Dollar is not an issue, all travel is domestic. Fuel is about where it was pre covid. Load factor is best ever, revenue per mile increasing to pre covid levels."
"At this point, there is a pretty good chance our ""friendly & helpful"" market makers will see to it that the stock falls below$30 - in order to harvest the stop loss orders there."
"I bought in at $24. Based on how many people I know traveling to the islands and its previous high in 2019, above $40, I predict a solid rebound of this stock over the next year. Im holding until about $45.People are finally feeling safe to travel and many are picking Miami and Hawaii as their destinations. My bet is on Hawaiian. I know other airlines like united and southwest are options, but I feel those have already jumped and Hawaiian is the last to return to its old highs. Furthermore, this airline is much more aloha and its vibe is much different compared to the other airlines. I see a jump in ridership thru 2021 and profits up at the start of 2022.HA will be over $30 by the end of June! Buy in while its low!"
Biden advisor already said closing down for 6 weeks is the best call for the virus. Seems like we are heading back down if true.
BUY BUY BUY!! END OF SUMMER $50 
I have a feeling this will be under 9 in the next 2 weeks. This epidemic will take longer then people think to get workers back to work. Less travelers will hurt the airline industry for a longer time. Just saying.
Governor Ige now encouraging all visitors to stay away from the islands until COVID cases are more manageable. Hospitals now exceeding capacity and alternative opportunities being explored to handle the large surge in cases.
"LATEST STATUS ON TOP HAWAIIAN HOTELS RESERVATION FOLKS...100% FULL WILL CONTINUE WEEK AFTER WEEK THE DEMANDS ARE HIGH FOLKS, GOOD ENTRY RIGHT HERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LATE ALREADY DURING THIS POST...."
"$50 by the end of November. 6.4 million shares have been sold short. 98% of all shares outstanding are owned by institutions, and not one of them will be selling now. The shorts are now going to get taken to the cleaners."
"I just flew back yesterday from Hawaii and the flight was jammed packed. The airport in Maui was more crowded than pre-COVId times. Most family, like mine, are flying to HI. We were a group of 12. And while there, I found out another 3 families friends were vacationing in the islands too. Even though the process can be a bit cumbersome to fly out there, it actually gives a little peace of mind that everyone is being tested before boarding on flight. We are already planning to go back again! We flew with HA - they still take pride in being the only domestic airline that serves complimentary hot meals. Our hotel villas was at 100% capacity. So yeah, this summer HA will do extremely well!"
"Buying the dip! I know this is a $30+ stock right here.Once Hawaii allows vaccinated people to avoid quarantine, HA is gonna soar!"
All pilots are being called back to duties!!! Massive demands for traveling coming!!! Airlines heading to the motherlode in turbo mode... Let the TravelWar begin................#AAL #UAL #BA #LUV #JBLU #DAL #MESA #ALK #SKYW #HA #^DJI #^IXIC #APPL #GOLD
"Big down day in market. Hoping we get a big upside earnings report tonight, and positive news going forward."
"Another lockdown coming. Dem Governors are pulling together to force their state lockdowns to force congress to bail them out of more losses. Look at Hawaii Gov Ige. He kept Hawaii in 14 day quarantine, closed hotels to bare minimum, businesses closed and had the least covid cases in the US ! And now ?? This state will go BK. Hawaiians will come together and realize the state needs to turn to the Right. The state NEEDS TO GO RED !!"
Why the downgrade from Deutsche bank right in front of earnings?
