Long time shareholder. Stock at new high. Time for a dividend or stock split. The last split was a 2 for 5. Management always grants themselves stock and we pay for it. Lets have a 2 for 1 for the shareholder or a return of capital.
ptc if not cross 82 and hold above it will come 65
hopefully my 121-148 range will pay off before Oct 27th.
Any chance for PTC to go up again ? or is a downside trend?
Someone can explain why is faling?
This board is real quiet.. feel like this is a really promising company with amazing future growth potential. Thoughts on if this is already factored into the share price? Seems as though the P/E ratio is really high
We are reaching bottom. time to buy
How in the world is this stock at $73. Just looked at Value Line...they have barely grown revenues since 2008 (yeah...that recession) and earnings were higher then....yet stock is up multiples.....wwwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaattttt. Someone please talk me out of initiating short position.

"Why is the CEO and all the officers selling shares, if the news about ROK is so positive? I know, 'they sell for lots of reasons', but look at the long list of sales by officers......huge long, long list, and they are all selling."
"PTC Adding to S&P500 - It is funny that when TESLA adding to S&P 500, the news drove 10% upside to the stock which is tens billions dollar, but when PTC news on adding into S&P 500, there is not even one piece of wave...What does that mean, PTC volume shall be higher and more institution shall hold PTC. PTC shall get a good boost to the upside. Big news for PTC share holders. Buy now."
