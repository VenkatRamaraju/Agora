Nice earnings report. SCHW may well make a push to a new 52-wk high.
They should be investigated for market manipulation. My Twtr has been shorted the moment i bought with think or swim. Sec where are you. They trade against their clients that should be illegal
No dividend with HOOD
SCHW has huge problems with their trading platform. They do not know how to fix it or they do not have proper stuff.Expect traders to leave this company. Robinhood is going to gain more customers.Schwab goes down in their quality.
The Charles Schwab reached an all time high at 79.74
I do not worry about Charles Schwab
Waiting for the TD Ameritrade integration FUBAR to happen.
I thought the earnings report was yesterday? Did it get pushed back?

Need to raise the dividend

"You ever notice the market cap of this stock jumps substantially when it goes up just a couple of dollars? They have close to 1.9 billion shares outstanding, which is quite alot!"
"Those that don't understand the business are selling out of fear... Those that do are holding and possibly buying more shares, which will end up being a gift one day. Schwab is focused on gathering assets and offering free trades is a great way to drive more assets their way. Sell if you don't like the move... PLEASE!!"
Slow but steady increase
Itâ€™ll be in the $90s by December
"Very smart of Schwab to acknowledge the way the industry was headed and get on with the zero commissions already. That stops the bleeding of losing to free brokers, while at the same time forcing their competitors who rely MUCH more heavily on commissions to adapt or go extinct. Schwab will be the long-term winner here. Their service and diversified business model will enable them to succeed despite losing that 4% revenue line item. I expect consolidation in the future."
The Charles Schwab reached an all time high at 83.40
