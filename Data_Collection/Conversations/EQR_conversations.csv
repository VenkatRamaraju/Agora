"At the end of the day, no matter how much money you make, everyone needs a home right?"
"Hard to make money when offering 5 months free on a lease...long long term it will turnaround, but not 2021."
"Whats with this? joint venture of Jefferson Apartment Group and Lasalle Investment Management has acquired the 289-unit CityView at Longwood apartment complex adjacent to Boston’s Longwood Medical Area and plans to upgrade the property.The seller was Chicago-based Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR), and the sale price was around $180 million, a Jefferson Apartment Group representative said. The McLean, Virginia-based apartment development firm owns multi-family complexes in Florida, Pennsylvania, the Washington, D.C. area and New England. Its Massachusetts assets include Jefferson One Upland at 8 Upland Woods Circle in Norwood, Arlington 360 at 4105 Symmes Circle in Arlington, Legacy Park at 112 Marston St. in Lawrence and the under-construction J Malden Center at 190 Pleasant St. in Malden. Jim Butz, CEO of Jefferson Apartment Group, said in a statement that the company plans to upgrade both the CityView units as well as the complex’s common areas."
"The EQR fourth quarter earnings report was fair, could have been better. Did not sound like we will get an increase of the dividend. High quality rentals in good locations will hold me and rents will be increased over time."
"after I finish toying around with over valued tech stocks in a week or 2, I'm moving all my profits here."
did Sam Zell just promise us a gargantuan special dividend?
This is a huge buy ! Lowest SP for the year. Next year will be stellar and back to high 50's. No brainer !

"EQR lost a little steam at the end of the week after reaching a 52 week high on Wednesday.I still believe there is room for share price to move up, but that might be held back by general market weakness over the next few weeks. Still a good investment in my view for investors looking long term.Good Luck to all EQR Investors."
Residential apartments still in high demand post Coronavirus. I added more eqr to take advantage of the panic price decline. I never lost a night's sleep with eqr.
EQR has 178.33 M in cash w/ $1.4B of positive cash flow from operations. This results in CPS ratio of 0.48 (EXCELLENT) compared to sector avg at .27. In addition over 93.0% of EQR shares are held by institutions such as insurance companies indicating a strong confidence from institutions.
"Rent won't get paid over the summer. Renters young and old will flee the city for mom's house or their second home, and give up the lease. Businesses, large and small, especially large, will abandon commercial leases for liability concerns of the virus, and that will last many years. EQR has debt. If they had NO debt they would be ok, but they have debt, and this is the perfect storm to destroy city real estate. The virus is in the venting systems, the bathrooms, the hallways, the doors. Watch rent prices go down faster than ever in history."
Don't know why fund managers are afraid of Equity Residential. Strongest REIt around.
"This stock is in a bubble territory right now. With US10Y this low, a rise in yield back to 1.8% is coming. This stock will go back down to the $70's."
Q3 earnings release on 10/26 AH
Perfect dividend stock for the long-term investor.
EQR should consider the best in smart security from a company with the stock symbol AITX.
Small fry investor picking up shares here in the low 50s. Gonna throttle back for now and see how this looks in late fall-winter.
"Debt to EBITDA is at 5.12, and the payout ratio is insane. Had a 6% growth in FFO 2019-2020 1Q. The REIT looks pretty decent :)"
Buy buy buy
"I am a retired dividend investor. No loss of sleep for me with eqr. A safe blue chip REIT. Even the nutty Left like Biden, Bernie, and AOC know that people have to rent apartments."
Equity Residential reached a 52 Week low at 69.60
"Don't know who monitors these boards, but wish they would ban/ delete politically oriented ones. Plenty of places to express ones views without clogging up boards such as this dedicated to other interests. And you know what they say about opinions..."
"Buying more shares today.Adding to my PLD (REIT-Owner Developer ofbig box warehouses equipped with logisticaland high tech support services), Bob Bowman has a targetof $135 on PLD."
Death of the urban core was tremendously premature and overstated.Time to sign your lease in San Francisco and New York before these great EQR deals are gone!!!
Low interest rates forever + huge fiscal and monetary stimulus = skyrocketing real estate prices. End of pandemic = improving operating performance of EQR. I am long 2023 calls at $95. I never buy calls. This thing will rocket higher over the next 18 months.
"I think it's kind of interesting to see EQR go down while TOL goes up on the news that EQR is teaming up with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers on a new apartment development joint venture.I guess the market doesn't like the added debt to EQR, but likes the new building contracts for TOL."
Nice bump today
"I worked for this company for years. The biggest difference between them and their main competitor, Avalon, is that they have focused almost entirely on acquiring urban properties and offloading suburban properties for years. Their portfolio is almost entirely limited to luxury urban dwellings in high price urban areas. Even if most of their tenants aren’t losing their jobs outright, nearly their entire portfolio is very sensitive to economic downturn that is especially focused in cities. Nevermind the debt load from new urban developments. It’s got support at $55 right now but I can see this going into the low 40’s easily. Long term put option may be worth the risk."
"Wow, this kind of buying on many depressed stocks is just insane. Many are up double digits this morning."
"Thinking of opening a big position on EQR. I've done the research, but I haven't been tracking it for long. What's the sentiment here? A year away from full recovery? Dividend safe? Thanks."
The overhead on their urban developments are huge. Really interested to see what unit occupancy and collections look like for June.
$EQR Initiates Coverage On Goldman Sachs Neutral USD 86 Upgraded by Deutsche Bank Sell » Hold USD 63 » USD 81
Most of EQR's properties are in apartment complexes. My wife used to manage their apartments for many years. Vacancies may increase over the months ahead but people don't want to be thrown out in the streets. Rates may decrease this summer as well hurting the bottom line like everyone else.
An idea to improve occupancy is to offer Movie Pass free subscription to new tenants for the length of their lease.
$EQR. Thanks for the dividend! GLTA
"I would expect EQR to announce their April dividend sometime in the next 10 days. In years past, EQR normally raises their April dividend, so it will be interesting to see if they follow that pattern this time too."
"I am an equity residential resident. I live in a crowded 40 story building they own w/780 units in S. CA. They did nothing in response to COVID-19 until today. I sent this email in response to their negligence. I would take lawsuit risk pretty seriously here. More, resident WILL want out of their squallor and I think if they have cash flow issues, they should be shorted like crazy.""During the period of delay and negligent non-response, I felt the need to vacate my own home, which I did. Now that you have taken appropriate actions I will return to my home tomorrow. This decision to leave and my assessment of your response was not made from a place of emotion, but as a person who had to look at data and make impactful decisions about this as well. My conclusion that EQR was acting unreasonably and negligently is based on the fact that a reasonable person could not possibly in good faith have adequately taken stock of the situation and done what EQR did. I cannot speak to the role that concerns about factors unrelated to resident safety played in EQRs decision to delay.However I do feel that the delay in taking these actions put people in danger. Vantage Pointe staff is not responsible for that. Staff are the victims of the corporate negligence as well. EQR should be ashamed of itself. The people put most at risk were likely the maintenance staff. I suspect some of these people have to cross the border every day to work a hard job, and for a multi billion dollar corporation to put those people in a position where they not only could get sick get their family sick, but bring a disease into another country shows a level of corporate neglect that is quite disappointing."""
EQR reached a 52 Week high at 87.36
New 52 week high yesterday before late trading pullback.
