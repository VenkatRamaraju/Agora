ANIK is up 16.36% to 47.50
The scenarios are quite interesting at current levels for ANIK. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesome.stocks.
ANIK reached a new 52 Week Low at 30.56
How about a pool? First day to close under $40? I’m picking Valentine Day because I love it.
ANIK reached a 52 Week low at 28.57
"Get ready. Looks like next week will be buying time at $50. Just need one day of panic instead of this slow bleed. Slow may get there, but wouldn’t touch until there’s a big melt day."
ANIK is down 6.91% to 38.55
Anika Therapeutics is up 5.37% to 34.34
"As we say in Japan, sayonara $50s"
"Let the games begin. As predicted $60s are gone. “ down and down it goes, where it stops, nobody knows”. I’m now betting on $40’s. There seems to be no support and those who bought on run up will panic. Great buy in $40s."
Anika Therapeutics is up 6.44% to 41.80
Lousy 4th qtr and weak guidance for 18. Say goodbye to the $50’s. Lets hope it doesn’t revert to the pe the numbers call for.
"The optimists just don’t pay any attention to numbers. Good company hitting their numbers reliably, but no matter how realistically optimistic you are, not worth high $60s. Buy big at $50 or so, and maybe hold at $60. Nothing but down hill until then. Point or 3 a day down till then."

"How to recognize Wall Street pimps? Well here is an example. Zacks is a self claimed financial advising entity that I have followed for a long time... to make a long story short their recommendations to retail investors most often translates into kiss of death for the stock... they appear to do the dirty job of pump and dump on behalf of pairs big brokerage houses... latest example...They are pushing very hard to pump ANIK which is an integrated joint preservation, restoration and regenerative solutions company with products across the orthopedic early intervention continuum of care, and in the process they are trying to compare it with literally every other stock out there and anything that moves... one bein NEO (which is a genetic testing company) among other companies that are not even in the same line of business...Never mind the fact that ANIK and for example NEO are not even competing with each other, ANIK’s financials at best are obscure and at worse vague...Now one may ask how and why retail investors listen to zacks in spite of them being a contrarian sign... well... that is what they have become as retail investors have identified zacks as being a Wall Street pimp on behalf of big brothel houses of Wall Street:)-"
In at 75.00
Anika Therapeutics is down 6.91% to 38.55
I changed my mind on my earlier post about the high PE...just trying to scare people into selling.
"Appears health reform bill is dead and that Trump will pin the failure on Ryan. If he moves onto other tasks that should bode well for the medical industry so whatever part of Anika's meltdown is attributable to fears of ""reform"" via pricing ect should abate."
"Dead in the water for 19, and probably 20. Strategic plan seems to buy out the insiders."
A company whose sales are not growing and is selling at a multiple of over 5X sales believes that the best thing they can do with their cash is buy their own stock? A company that has significantly underspent its peers in R&D can't find anything else to invest in? A 30 million buyback is going to purchase as many shares as the former CEO took into retirement. This Board needs to go.
According to the last yearly proxy the 6 principal employees make $9.3 million about 11/2 % of the capitalization of Anika.Very few companies in my research show that.The compensation should be changed!!!!!!!
Anika Therapeutics is down 6.27% to 43.08
ANIK reached a 52 Week low at 23.55
EREN: did u learn anything about misprints this morning? It’s clowns like you who ignore facts in favor of wishes that ran this up and will now ride it back down. Take your loss and renter when it hits an appropriate value. Probably $50
"Ooof. Who would play trading games with such a slimly traded stock? Today's drop makes no sense whatsoever, except to an opportunistic buyer. Thank you, whomever drove the share price down over 10% today. This gave us an opportunity to embellish our share position."
Told shorties $60 was the floor and yet you didn't believe well if you had gains shorties you are gonna lose them onto the mid 70s to 80s now after the company's best home run ER to date!

Dollar a day club as the “Tutes” continue to slowly dump off on the retail market. Almost hard to believe they can still find suckers after taking it down by a third from the pump.

"Here’s a bit of info that I wish I had picked up earlier. 20+% of the float was short before yesterday’s news. Pretty high for a no name company. Lots of odd things going on here. Selling at 70% of 52 week height and still 20% short, mysterious buybacks ect. What’s next?"
"Numbers were weak and guidance not great, but this bail out seems excessive. Am I missing something?"

Really? Closed 13 cents above 60 and you are declaring the floor is in? So what do you think is going to propel this stock into the 80's? A year ago they were ratcheting down revenue estimates for 2019. Before Q3 they were guiding for revenues to be down 3-6% in 2019 compared with 2018. They surprised in Q3 and now say revenues will be up 6-7% in 2019. That surprise is why the stock jumped into the 70's. Until investors looked at the details. They are now projecting 2019 revenues that will be less than they were in 2017. And for Q4 revenues are expected to be flat with Q4 2018. And they have no new product approvals for years. And they are ramping up spending just to maintain those flat sales. You have a better chance of seeing 40's than you do seeing 80's.
High volume sell off a week before earnings isn’t encouraging
"ANIK’s CEO received $10,000,000 last year without any performance. This company is operated only to enrich management. - not shareholders.Shame on the lot of them. we are out after they filed their proxy."
Get ready Longs This is showing less support as the drop continues. Suspect when $60 is breached tomorrow there’s a possibility of a one or two day rout thru the $50s. Could catch a bargain in the mid $40s. A full round tripper. Momentum can be your friend.

Hate Zacks.
"Wow! Looks great. Backup the truck and unload. Gotcha U thought I was going to say load up...Cash = 143M and 30M buyback announced after 1Q earnings. Wonder how many shares were bought today.Share buyback was supposed to be accelerated so buys were to occur over late May to end of 2018....On the downside, flat revenue growth for 2018 at operating expenses of 90M. I think 2018 earnings will be negative based on this since rest of year company would only break even at best with around 20M operating expenses (note 1Q operating expenses were 30M resulting in 60M for 2Q-4Q 2018). With 1Q revenue around 21M, I don't see company making any money rest of year resuilting in a loss for 2018...Cheaper stocks get cheaper...Load up all U can at this bargain prices...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
Anika Therapeutics is down 7.14% to 33.79
Whoosh!
great time to buy ANIK--will make up all the losses and then some in the next few months
Company has no revenue growth. The GP% are ans have been declining which tells me pricing is now a major issue. The conference calls have no transparency. They have been talking about an acquisition for 3 years instead they buy back stock..This is ALL recipe for a disaster. If you can short the hell out of his.BTW Has anyone heard from the retired lady in south florida?
Zack rating is really garbage. One day it is strong buy and then a turn around in a short stint to a sell. They double dip - taking subscriptions from the common Joe and then big money from Wall street guys for the turnaround. I have lost faith in them.
Anika Therapeutics is up 5.68% to 35.00
Averaged down another 195 shares as I told you shorties this is going to attack the 60$ region and then consolidate and move up higher. You are not getting it cheaper. This is a phenomenal company and you are out of your minds or delusional if you honestly believe in the 40$s I would cover up if I were you. Small cap bios are my speciality and I am up this year 26K alone on small cap bios. Good luck to if I had more dough I would buy more at these gift prices!
"Hmm. Contrarion move today... usually goes down after even a beat on financials. This time ho-hum, but went up!Chuck is such a funny guy!"
Maybe we find $40’s this week. About 2 weeks late but coming.
ANIK is up 7.67% to 29.77
ANIK is a BUY now!! It will reach to mid $30.00 this morning 
whoever is trading this down should get a clue. sell stock down 10 pts from high but never sold any when it was there

Can I change my sub $40 prediction from 2/14 to tomorrow? Talk about screwing the pooch!
Appears they’re paying an immediate 2 1/2 times revs for 2 low margin operations plus big kickers. Clearly a desperate move to move their top line. Surprised the institutions that hold so much stock and rely on ratios aren’t running for the hills. Assume it’s because there’s no one to buy their stock.

"The mover here will be Cingal results. They should ""know"" these for the 26 weeks. Cingal beat a cleared HA clearly.. at the short end and seemingly at the long, though why longer is a mystery? Now we wait to see if it beats steroid on long duration. Compare to that Bioventus stuff: failed every trial, then they went to China, and got the Chines to show it was no worse than their 5-shot goo. Buyback could be a smart move, or then not..."

"Oooh, Great! Bring that price per share down into the 20's. Suits me...would love to acquire a few hundred shares around 25 or 26.Parsing the 10Q is difficult because, shall we say, a bit opaque...inventory levels could become an issue; SG&A spend will need to be clarified next quarter, and the covid flu is a wild card on both sales for prodedures and clinical trials....all great reasons to drive the share price down.Please do."
"Joseph, do the right thing and resign"
The study showed a strong safety profile which matched with the previous clinical studies (13-01 phase III study). The duration of pain reduction was also similar to the previous study as patient improvement after Cingal injection was maintained near peak levels throughout the 26-week duration of the study.
Why has ANIK stock price declined so much ? MANIPULATION !!1
why not 65-70% drop?
"stock down over 3% on 8k shares. would be a buyer in here. The russia news is nonsense,"
Bought at 48. Looks a bargain price to me. Will see
"It is not a one-trick pony. It has other products and has cash. They need more work and has expertise.So, although it is disappointing but the future is not bleak. It will rebound 10% in a short time."
Anyone get a warm and fuzzy from the ANIK conference call?I didn't think so. Try to get a straight answer out of this team. Reading between the lines it seems clear the go forward strategy is to overpay for low margin revenues to keep the appearance of top line growth. Great 5 year strategy!
Relatively high volume sell-off. Seems a little early for earnings leak but funds can probably read the tea leafs

"Address the elephant in the room. Missing results is all part of the game, but bailing the founder out with an inexplicable share buyback before the announcement quite another.If Sherwood wasn't bailed out they'd gain some credibility. If that $30 was laundered to him they deserve a $1 stock price and a lot worse. Silence suggests the worse."
The stock will recover in a few days.....CINGAL works
Looks like all they're doing is buying the insiders stock. Doesn't bode well for year end results
"OK, this is too much. I just did the math on this. So the former CEO ""retires"" and takes 790,000 shares of the company stock with him according to the filing from a few months ago. After he leaves a whole bunch of bad news comes out and the stock drops. The company then decides to do a $30 million buyback when the stock is trading somewhere around $38 a share. If you divide 30 million by $38 you get......... about 789,000 shares. What a coincidence! I guess we know why they aren't making an acquisition."
LIONSTCOKALERTS (Gooogle) is the real deal! . They only alert small cap nas and nyse stocks and many of them have doubled for me! .
"Anyone want to speculate on the price decline(s). PE's a tad high, but guiding to low double digit growth. Don't get it"

"Insider activity not encouraging. Sherwood's selling is somewhat understandable as he has left the building, but it'd appear that with the exception of the exercise of low priced, no priced options all I see is selling. And it'd appear that about all Sherwood is holding are exercised options and grants that may not as yet be salable.Would like to hear some contrary observations that would dispel the notion that the price has topped out.Absent something unexpected happening this looks like a $40 stock based on fundamentals and guidance."

"If there’s $30 mil of treasury stock on their financials next qtr you must suspect they used it to bail Sherwood out before these results. And if they did it should be a perp walk for all of them.

The only reasonable explanation seems to be for acquisition.By the way, I liquidated my holdings in the last 3 years. It has been one of my best investments, albeit at the expense of super long time frame, 2nd only to the real estate ones made during the peak days of the housing market melt-down."

Everything was great until the final minutes of the CC when an analyst asked Sherwood about the potential IPO of Bioventus. He said they have been to busy to monitor. To Busy? They will be a direct competitor you. What he should have said is of course we are monitoring them they are a competitor. No wonder why it tanked......They also spoke about some pricing pressure and an increase in R&D in the latter part of the year. This happens every year and they are very apt at handling this. Barring the stupid comment by Sherwood.......BUY
Made Zacks strong sell list this morning. Seems some folks maybe had the list yesterday! Are they that influential?
So the Board of this company allowed the former CEO to hire what appears to be his own son as Corporate counsel? You can't make this stuff up. Now it makes sense why only one shareholder has made any money in this stock over the last year. How does a Board allow this to happen?
"While it has been observed that TH has a longer duration of effect than other corticosteroids, the results in this study were surprising. Nevertheless, the patient response to CINGAL in this study was strong as patients received statistically and clinically meaningful rapid and long-lasting improvement in symptoms compared with base-line, consistent with the previous study as well as my experience in my practice. Taken together, the results of the two Phase III studies validate the effectiveness of this novel combination for use in patients with knee osteoarthritis."

"Here are some numbers to mull over. Anika is laying out $100 mil up front for these 2 companies with kickers of another $100 depending on hitting milestones. At present the 2 are generating revs of $40 mil. Giving them a 15% net that’s $6 mil a year. Assuming each increase their net by a compounded 50% percent a year it’ll take 8 years to recover the $200K, before taxes. Granted any increases to net are permanent, but it migrates in favor of a long haul investment. Would like to see those formulas. Maybe the institution guys have. Those folks don’t do long haul."
Look at the numbers. Even after today’s beating it’s still carrying a PE in the low $20s. Factor in today’s news and maybe a stock scandal for good measure and $15 is more like it. Where are growth and profits to come from?

"Company reports an increase of 2.5 Million bucks in profit last qtr over same q last year and Market Cap rises 250 Million? That's a sliver but it's 100 times earnings? Really? SHORT AT WILL, EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE BACK IN 60S...."
Great buy at these levels! Adding...
ANIK is at oversold status; I am jumping in right about this moment. GLTA
LCI is very undervalued vs $ANIK and $ANIP
"Movie Hero. How do you like the increased volume? The higher the volume, the deeper the decline. Wait until the tuties accept this Hail Mary pass is a disaster and exit at any price. I revise my $40 to $30 and am doubling down."
Anika Therapeutics is down 10.25% to 31.01
ANIK reached a new All Time High at 63.11
Only 2 up days in the past 3 weeks. 20+% off it's high and volume is picking up. Options are looking negative. Something appears rotten in Lexington.
ANIK is down 7.61% to 23.31
"AQST a buyout is coming instead, $FTSV $MYL $ANIK $BMRN bullish"
I've been invested in ANIK for years-I've always heard that one of the major reasons that the company hasn't done even better is because of the moves of Sherwood--there seemed to be a consensus he was dragging the company down--now that he's gone maybe this will change
My Estimates for Q2-2016Revenue $25.6EPS $.55Another easy beat. Also there is probably an additional $.02 - $.04 upside due to my conservatism. As I have stated several times over Q4-15 was the break out quarter. ANIK has many exciting opportunities both in Europe and in China that I do not believe were in the 2016 forecast. One thin about ANIK they are under promise and over deliver.
Anika Therapeutics is down 6.53% to 35.64
"amazing how ANIK ""hovers"" around $60 but each day always finishes less than this--hopefully if the announced earnings report Oct 25 is positive--$60 will be in the ""rear view mirror"""
Sub $40 looking like a guarantee. Insiders still doing nothing but selling. Watching them to find an entry point.
"Flat lined financials, two meaningless, probably horrible, acquisitions and now the CEO passes prematurely. What could possibly go wrong? Imagine if they’d used the excess cash to buy Amazon stock!"
Anika Therapeutics is up 5.78% to 42.30
"Great employment report this morning. I think I've found the reason unemployment was down. I went to the Anika website to do a little research, and noticed they have 13 executives at the VP level or higher! That's a lot of fat for a company that will be lucky to achieve revenues equal to 2017 this year."
Anika Therapeutics is down 6.67% to 32.33
"Press are saying Sanofi to pay a billion for FLXN: that is 50% more than ANIK.. take cash into consideration and way more. I mean way more. If it takes 5yrs to get to cashflow from Flexion, Anik minus the cash would be some 300 m."
could ANIK be a takeover target? generating ++profit/advancing new products for treatment of arthritis/joint replacements etc--seems like a very attractive target to a larger player
"Hope for longs, caution for shorts. The institutions are clearing expressing their opinions on these acquisitions with their feet. There’s a long shot possibly these deals will be killed. Figure they may take it back to the $20’s if the deals close, $50 if they kill them. Nice motivation to cut bait unless there’s some monkey business going on or near criminal stupidity to ignore such clear signals."
"So, you don't chuck Chuck... he retires. Panned regime change might explain staff turnover recently... putting his own people in place? RiSK AND REWARD just went up..."
"$60, where art thou? Waiting to nibble. Half way there, but more slowly than expected."
"Market reacted wrong way here, they kept the guidance! They also pulled a new product out of the hat: 510k already sent in. And finally seeking an ""sNDA"" for a 9-month steroid/HA. IF the data backs that up it is game over for Flexion and most of the HAs..."
ANIK is up 6.95% to 27.23
"I'm not sure about ""game over"" for FLXN/Zilretta. If duration in KL2-3 is better and efficacy at least similar, there may be significant market share pulled. 13-01 is KL1-3 (only 20% KL3) unlike Zilretta. So, many less severe OAK patients than Zilretta's trials. ALSO:1) Zilretta has PK data in diabetics showing much reduced systemic leakage and proof of no increase in glucose, unlike immediate release CS2) Zilretta has about a year head start3) Is there any Phase IV data from international use (15 countries) that shows what KL2-3 efficacy is?"
AQST now a strong buyout target $BMRN $NBIX $ANIK $ALNY $JNJ sector M&A
Enjoy your few days of fun shorties on NO volume and year end tax selling 40$s you humour me ain't happening again 95% tutes they will push it up soon with short covering. Take your gains don't get greedy you are not seeing 50$s...
Should be off 50% not 15. $15 FMV
ANIK reached a new All Time High at 63.82
