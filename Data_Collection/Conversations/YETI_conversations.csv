"Good product, just over price by a lot just like the stock"
stock splits when?
Reverse Timber???
Is this price action options-related?
"Bought my first YETI 36 oz. rambler bottle last weekend. Been using it for iced tea all week. I had always believed YETI's products worked as advertised but I had to see for myself. And indeed the product works as advertised. From the time I poured the iced tea in to 5-6 hours later the tea was still ice cold, even after spending an hour in a boiling hot car. This only convinces me to throw even more money at this stock now. I always like to say before investing in a company try out its products first or visit their stores to get a see and touch look. YETI is the real deal and the competition is no match."
Far too much competition for the High multiple
Any idea why $YETI is going down so much?
"My family and friends cabinets are full of yeti cups now. I take mine everywhere I go, none of us ever use plastic water bottles anymore."

"max pain for options ( most profit for option writers) is $90if you see the stock shoot up before close on Friyou will know why, yet this is all legal SEC is in bed with wall stas the FDA is in bed with big Pharmajust use these facts to make money."
"Love these guys! Love the product, Love the vision! But there are a ton of retail stores in my area that can't get there hands on the product. I'm assuming they are having Yetis having some production/inventory issues due to Covid? Understandable, but I want to see this company flourish! I've been a long time investor, hopefully it's nothing."
Yeti made leak resistant mags now! Stock will fly
"Yeti is the new status symbol for men that enjoy the outdoors. Guys are buying their coolers, hats, coffee mugs, you name it. I’m seeing it popping up everywhere. I’m Bullish"
"YETI inventories are very low, cutting out promotional companies. They just can't supply product.super bumpy ride ahead."
