I’ve had an Igloo cooler for 15 years. It works great with no problems. I think I paid between $40-50 for it. Why would I go out and buy one of these really expensive coolers? What do they do that other sturdy coolers don’t?

"Another new product coming soon, the loadout gobox, its a waterproof rugged cargo box, looks great"
YETI is at the top of this list!.
Looking for $36.22 by mid May
what r u guys buying in at? I was thinking 26 or 27 ? sold my last shares late but at 33.50 so it was good
Bought the dip at 86$!!
"Yeti isnt the only one having problems.Otterbox coolers can be found for 50% offif you look around the web.Arena is getting really crowded, but consumers will findsome real bargains in high end quality coolers."
"04:16 PM EDT, 09/15/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Matthew J Reintjes, Director, President, and CEO, on September 13, 2021, sold 25,000 shares in Yeti Holdings ( YETI ) for $2,475,204. Following the Form 4 filing with the SEC, Reintjes has control over a total of 194,114 shares of the company, with 194,114 shares held directly. The market value of the direct and indirect holding, based on the transaction price, is approximately $19,366,171.this stock is way over priced"
"Is anyone bothered by the high of $36.60 reached on April 30th, and then the sudden drop in share price over the next week for no apparent reason? Then on May 6th we get the announcement of a huge, approximately 11 million share secondary offering. Timing is very suspicious if you ask me. Maybe I am reading too much into this. Comments?"
Typical profit taking after ER... happened last time too. Now to figure out what’s a good entry point. Hmm.
May have resistance at 30 but hopefully by late this week early next week 30+
"Sold my position I bought in March, and what I held from before at $38.63. Averaged 36.8% short term gain. Will most likely buy back after earnings if the market trends from the prior year continues."
"Added another 500 when it was at $27. If it goes down to $26, I’ll add another 500 shares to my portfolio. If it goes up to $31-$35, I’m selling it all."
"When you sell existing stock and purchase another (Yeti) anticipating an earnings bump so that you can buy more of the other... only to have YETI drop while watching you original stock go up. Then watching other stocks you considered get bumps, from less impressive earnings. Story of my investing career."
"YETI has a 66 P/E. Insane. Not sure what their growth strategies are, but hard to sell multiple durable coolers, cups, containers. YETI will need to attract major new fans to its brand as the depth of their product portfolio is pretty limited and therefore die hard fans of the brand only need to buy 1 of each and they last years. Just don’t see a 66 P/E being remotely justified for a cooler company."
What happened to our friend who bought at $26?
"I have problem with this stock. if people buy one things from yeti, will they continuing buying new mug?"
"I have to say that I was surprised by the amount of people who were surprised it dropped after a great earnings report. It’s literally the third, consecutive time it’s tanked after reporting a great ER. THIRD!! And we’ve been telling you for weeks if not months! HOW ARE YOU SURPRISED?!"
YETI is down 4.92% to 97.16
We need more shorts here. Not enough to squeeze to a breakout.
Love their products. I own a handful of items from them. Quality and USA made.
"So they offering about 10% more stock, is this gonna dip another 10% from dilution?"
We are a dealer of YETI and they are out of hard coolers for all dealers? They are saying they hope to be able to ship mid November. How can that happen?
"I heard that Yeti is a hot brand. But according to Yahoo charts, it closed at 408 on July 25, 2016. So why did it drop more than 90% to the current price of $34.71?"
What is their reason for secondary public offering? Especially if they will not be receiving any proceeds from the sale of shares from offering?
Predicted we would break $35 by the end of the month... $40 by end of may
Yeti made leak resistant mags now! Stock will fly
"Got a price alert today that it dropped to below $30 so I’m back! Going to wait until $28 to buy in. If it continues to drop after that, I’ll average down. And when it inevitably goes back up, I’ll sell during the short squeeze!"
TIMBER !
"$YETI been trying to educate, since this is a retail brand any many have ties to this brand. $YETI will end badly, if new product launches fail and now targeting international...be careful, how is AUD GDP performing? Pricing and margins will not hold in the international markets, ask yourself why did they pay down debt? YETI knows margins are decelerating and are trying to carry this hype as long as they can. More Form 4's on the way to D Dispose of shares"
"CORDOVA 50 Medium Cooler FAQshow much does it hold?Enough for a really good time, for 4 people who drink heavilyDoes this cooler come with a gun, or NRA membership?It comes filled with .50 cal ammunition, 2 bump stocks, a military grade suppressor for a .556, and a 6 month free subscription of “O” magazinehow many pop cans fit in med coolerI have fit two 18 pack cans of “pop” and 4 10lb bags of ice in it before and that was pretty much topped off.https://www.cordovacoolersofficial.com/"
boy am I glad I didn't hold this over the weekend
maybe the China contagion will hurt the overpriced stocks
"Agree with others. Re-test of $80 is likely. This is not a pure COVID play like you hear. Many YETI products are used for social gatherings indoor and outdoor that will offset any theoretical weakness due to the end of mass social distancing. Long term growth story very much intact. Buy under 70, hold over 80, load up under 55 if we get the chance."
what price is a good entry for long?
Hopefully go back up once open might be a good buy day as well
What a wonderful day! Sold out my 50% stocks. Remaining will go @38 next week if not tomorrow. I will wait to see it at 32 or 40 for another action.
28.14... I think I’ll jump back in but I’m jumping out at 31.00.
Gotta admire a company that can turn an overpriced cooler into a billion dollars.
stock splits when?
YETI manufactures a majority of their products in the U.S. and the Phillipines. Parts of two different products are manufactured in China.
Incredible brand. i plan to accumulate as it drifts toward the 50 day line. ibd industry rank is 180 something out of 197. so its not in vogue right now. Come july everyone will know yeti hehe. sell into strength. cheers
Let’s go for a ride!
"Saw that YETI dropped 5% and thought “bet they just released their ER.” What is this? Like, the 4th consecutive quarter where this has happened?!"
"As usual, daily volume of about 1.8mil, within minutes of after hours, 9.2 million. Gotta love those ppl loading up on shares in the AH."
Far too much competition for the High multiple
"Yeti’s advantage is they have built an extremely strong brand. I was in a ranch supply store today and they were sold out of Yeti dog bowls that cost $50 each. I’m sure there is no technological advantage of a yeti dog bowl over a competitor’s one, yet people are willing to shell out an insane amount for a bowl just because it’s Yeti brand. As Yeti continues to expand its product offerings into camp equipment, accessories, etc. I have a lot of confidence they can continue to command a premium over its competitors and be successful"
All for a cooler?
"Yeti is the new status symbol for men that enjoy the outdoors. Guys are buying their coolers, hats, coffee mugs, you name it. I’m seeing it popping up everywhere. I’m Bullish"
"This is a broken stock and just being gamed. I would not look at this company as an investment just a trade. I was long for awhile, but gave up and got out. Each earnings the stock dips even with a beat."
What is going on here?
I'll buy at 28 to 29
Crushed earnings. You know the drill. Buy on the dip. We may not see the low 70s ever again. 33x earnings projection is a good price for this fast grower.
Yeti going to 100. Summer is here and boaters and campers love their products
$400 for a cooler. I don’t get it.
Absolutely! Just a minor pullback here before trending higher.
Earnings look good to me what do you guys think?
"the earning report looks so good, but why is it down 8% already?"
"A recent article which appeared on Barrons dated 4/11/19 It looks like the brand is gaining momentum from an army of loyal customers.======================================================================Yeti Stock Jumps as an Analyst Calls the Street's Outlook Too 'Conservative' -- Barrons.com3:24 pm ET April 11, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy David Marino-NachisonShares of outdoor-gear maker Yeti Holdings rose Thursday as a Wall Street analyst said the consensus view of its growth potential was too conservative.Yeti stock (YETI) was recently up 6% to $31.95, putting it up some 115% in 2019. Cowen analyst John Kernan started coverage of the stock Thursday with an Outperform rating and a $35 price target, higher than FactSet's $31 average.That average target is near current levels, but analysts are generally upbeat about the company. Of the nine with ratings tracked by FactSet, only one doesn't have a Buy rating or its equivalent, and even that one analyst has a price target a bit above the latest prices. (Earlier this year, though, the Buys were unanimous.)""Consensus sales and earnings per share estimates appear conservative as the shift to direct-to-consumer accelerates,"" Kernan writes. ""Implied estimates around wholesale and international segments suggest additional conservatism.""Yeti's brand became something of a phenomenon thanks to a cultlike appreciation for its coolers, which run more than $1,000 for the Tundra 350, a boatlike piece of gear that looks terrific if one happens to have a pickup truck -- or Canyonero -- large enough to transport it.But the company has expanded beyond coolers into bags, chairs, and accessories, giving shoppers more (and smaller, and cheaper) opportunities to buy something with the blocky ""YETI"" logo emblazoned on it. Sales rose 22% year over year in 2018, with drinkware claiming more of that pie than coolers and equipment, as gross margins widened.""We'll continue to find places where the Yeti brand belongs and where we can change the nature of a consumer's engagement with a product,"" CEO Matt Reintjes said during a February conference call with investors. (The company's next quarterly report is scheduled for May 2.) ""As an innovator, that mind-set is incredibly important to us. That's what keeps us authentic and what keeps our customers excited to come back for more.""Investors have bought into that vision. The stock went public in October, and while it dipped a bit in December, it began climbing from lows later that month and hasn't looked back. ( Barron's Jack Hough took a look at Yeti in February.)Kernan estimates 2020 revenue of $994 million and earnings of $1.11 per share -- both numbers that are ahead of current estimates -- aided by ""a devoted group of loyal consumers willing to pay premium price points across equipment, drinkware and ancillary categories,"" he writes. ""Brand extensions...create a durable growth profile.""Email David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com. Follow him at @marinonachison and follow Barron's Next at @barronsnext ."
"I’m aiming for $28 or Dec 1, Rick is aiming for $27 or Dec 27, and Michael is waiting for $26. It will likely drop lower than $28 and I’ll add more if it continues to gap down after that."
recieved Yeti catalog in the mail today

28.11! I’m back in.
"My family and friends cabinets are full of yeti cups now. I take mine everywhere I go, none of us ever use plastic water bottles anymore."
Time to climb into a 3 handle!!
R u ready for:
Nice earnings beat. Hopefully it can overcome virus scare. If not should rocket up next week.
Sell on the news makes no sense.. it's just sell because. Company beats and raises and gets cut by 10%? Thank you computers?
What’s a good price to get back in at?
What is a good price to sell at in your opinions?
"YETI inventories are very low, cutting out promotional companies. They just can't supply product.super bumpy ride ahead."

Today... I have major hangover from drinking too much vodka from my YETI tumbler last night. But I feel much better than SHORTS with YETI up 4%!
"Decisions, decisions. The wife just got a new Chevy Tahoe and we are looking for input as to what bumper sticker we should put on it.Should we go with the tried and true YETI bumper sticker? I have five of them on my SUV. Or, do we go with the Hope Global bumper sticker? They happen to be the world’s largest manufacturer of shoelaces.It’s very important to the wife and I that we broadcast to the world of the materialistic purchases we are so proud of."
Strong earnings coming out Thursday morning. The best they have ever made.
"Don't own any but pondering and like their products. ER was pretty good IMO, but this selloff is a bit overdone I think and possibly giving me an opportunity to buy a few shares. I use the 3-day rule after a selloff so I may be a new shareholder on the 3rd of December... If it pops back big I will prob hold off but like the dust to settle... GL to those who hold."
I think it's going to 38 in the next 2 weeks!
Loving the Yetster!!!! Long term hold...
Anyone know what is going on today (4/22) to make it drop 6.3%?
All-time high for YETI on robust volume with 7% short interest... what's not to like? We got a short on the thread dissing the cups. Dude needs to get to a Shorter's Anonymous ASAP.
Good day for Yeti!
"Good product, just over price by a lot just like the stock"
Who believes the earnings will be a miss?
This is a dip to buy. Better than expected earnings and better than expected sales and still a selloff? Analysts and investors are missing the forest for the trees. This will revisit the highs then soar past them.
$35 by end of month
Is it worth buying at current price
This will be a $40 stock soon
why insider keep on selling..
"Still my biggest regret ever. Bought at $17, and sold at $70. Congrats to all of you if you’re still holding it."
Bought puts for tomorrow’s drop. Be rewarded.
$29.5? Hmmm. I’ll buy 1000 shares and will add another 1000 if it drops to the $28 I was originally hoping for.
Here comes the start of the upgrades - Jeffries new target price $45https://seekingalpha.com/news/3458137-fear-yeti-jefferies
Is this price action options-related?
Just bought 1000 shares. Going long with this bad boy! Think yeti is a great re opening stock as well! Hope I made the right decision.
Very nice earnings release. YETI beat & guided up. This may get interesting as there are a lot of shorts on the wrong side of this thing.
Buying 1000 shares at 26.05.
Will be $40 by end of may and $60-70 by end of year
Why is volume trading down?? Use to average 1-2 million shares traded daily!! Seems like an issue going forward.
I sold this morning and made me enough to buy me one of them fancy coolers!
Down on a beat. The story of my investing career.
Worth 7.7B? Doubt it
Misses my sell price by 10 cents. But the storm was strong this morning.
"Love these guys! Love the product, Love the vision! But there are a ton of retail stores in my area that can't get there hands on the product. I'm assuming they are having Yetis having some production/inventory issues due to Covid? Understandable, but I want to see this company flourish! I've been a long time investor, hopefully it's nothing."
Short Interest is nearing 70% of float. Won’t be long before there will be no shares available to short.
there a many people starting up coolers in their garages lol or just spec one out and have china make ithttps://www.icelandcooler.com/collections/coolers-1/products/longship-series-70-qt-cooler
"Love all the Yeti products. Best Xmas gift,"
I laugh when I see “investors” walk past a quarter 20 times and then pick up a dollar and brag about it!
Down because the whole DOW is downWill come back up
"Bought my first YETI 36 oz. rambler bottle last weekend. Been using it for iced tea all week. I had always believed YETI's products worked as advertised but I had to see for myself. And indeed the product works as advertised. From the time I poured the iced tea in to 5-6 hours later the tea was still ice cold, even after spending an hour in a boiling hot car. This only convinces me to throw even more money at this stock now. I always like to say before investing in a company try out its products first or visit their stores to get a see and touch look. YETI is the real deal and the competition is no match."
Any idea why $YETI is going down so much?
"Its a cooler company trading at ~40x forward earnings! It is not changing the world, It is changing the Executive's lives not yours."
And this is why I bought 1000 shares at $26.05!
There has been competition lately on their products but I still think the brand is extremely strong and their marketing sets them apart
Tip of the day: Never listen to Cramer... Do the opposite!
still waiting for $28 folks?
Does yeti hit $30 by end of day tomorrow? Thoughts and reactions. Let’s hear what you all think
"Yeti is a good product, but with a mounting competition . Every time I look there is a new name on the shelf in a store I happen to be in, with the same looking product . Just don't get caught investing in a company just because you use and like the product ."
Remember this moment the next time there is profit taking and this pulls back 10%-15%. You just have to get through the bumps.
"Find someone who loves you, the way YETI loves secondary offerings."
"YETI investors! I want to let you all know how much of a big man I feel like today. I always wanted some device, some mechanism, of broadcasting to the world that not only am I a world-class adventurer, but I wanted to tell the world that I can afford $400+ coolers! I just have this amazing and superficial need to tell the world that something as trivial as an ice cooler, I will spend boatloads of money on. Because I don’t settle for the ordinary, even when it comes to my beloved ice coolers. I now have that mechanism, to tell the world what I can afford. I put FIVE (5) bumper stickers on my SUV of the word YETI. Every angle, every side. Just to be sure, that this world knows that I can afford $400 ice coolers. I swear I can just feel the envy from other drivers, especially at stop lights! I FEEL SO BIGLY"
people are panicking for no reason this is going to be another GOOS. Same concept different name
"“YETI severed ties with the NRA and is now engaging in damage control after a backlash from many of its customers. In early March, YETI refused to place a previously negotiated order from NRA-ILA, citing ‘recent events’ as the reason – a clear reference to the tragedy in Parkland, Florida. YETI then delivered notice to the NRA Foundation that it was terminating a 7-year agreement and demanded that the NRA remove the YETI name and logo from all NRA digital assets, as well as refrain from using any YETI trademarks in future print material. YETI is trying to spin the story otherwise, those are the facts. While Yeti can change their story, but they can’t change the facts. Whether their changing story is due to the recent cancellation of the IPO from their New York City owners is a question only, they can answer.” — Marion P. Hammer."
Breakout!
This will most probably go further down creating buying opportunity.
My 16 year old son bought this at $13.95. I should have listened to him and added this to my portfolio. The question is do you do the prudent thing and sell half and let the remaining ride? Now he has an unrealistic expectation that stocks double in no time! How much longer can this run up so fast?
"Hopefully, the $20 Resistance is taken outGreat quarter.EPS of $0.88-0.90, up from $0.79-0.82, vs $0.78"
"my guess is to shake out the faint of heart, YETI has been on a tear lately, look around, everyone is using a YETI of some sort, whether it's a tumbler, coffee mug or some sort of cooler. It's a solid brand, like AAPL or LULU, and expect it to soar after earnings, especially with the new Lowes deal, and international expansion. I was even able to visit their store in Austin, TX, they seem to be doing everything right. As long as they can keep up with production, we should be cool!!! Stay cool, and stay long"
YETI is up 6.28% to 92.15
"YETI book value is $2.56/share trading north of $60 for a cooler, backpack and travel mug company..."
"max pain for options ( most profit for option writers) is $90if you see the stock shoot up before close on Friyou will know why, yet this is all legal SEC is in bed with wall stas the FDA is in bed with big Pharmajust use these facts to make money."
Why is it down so much with such good earnings?
Reverse Timber???
I am looking at this with interest. But that's it. I'm just interested. Grizzlies can't even get into this cooler. That's handy. Also I think Jack Links should merge with Yeti.
"Imho, Yeti is probably one of the best consumer-related stocks for the reopening stocks in this market.America is ready to live again by experiencing the great outdoors. We're going higher, much higher!GLTA"
Yeti is the Apple of coolers and outdoor stuff. It is an experience not just a product.
