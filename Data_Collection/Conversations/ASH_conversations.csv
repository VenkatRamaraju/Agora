Time to get in on this. Doing the long draw and pump...ride this to serious $ash money.
"There it is, very bad earnings, big miss on EPS and Revenue. Stock is not down that much in the AH session, but only because it is not a very high volume. But now I am even more confident we will see a big sell-off in the regular session tomorrow."

"Definitely Selling Short ASH today as my next Pure Earnings play, but still have not made a final decision about the one after that. Right now, I am leaning in favor of a 95+% hard capital BA Short Sell. I almost thought myself out of that play yesterday, but then I gave it a more logical analysis last night and especially given the current CoronaVirus issue, it just seems like the best risk/reward scenario play. BA has so many negative, uncertain, and worrisome issues going on right now, you add a terrible earnings release on top of that, and the stock IS going to sell off, IMO. So that is what my thinking is right now, I still have a full day more to mull it over, but at this time a full BA Short Sell, not playing either ANTM or MKSI to the Long side, seems to be where my head is at. :-) Best of Luck to All this week. :-)"

"Just shorted this baby going into earnings. She is way overvalued and I expect a poor earnings report in just a few minutes, to result in a significant price correction to the $70 level. We shall see what happens... :-)"
"Gonna look to Cover this ASH Short tomorrow at $72 or less, then do my BA Short play, hopefully before 2 PM ET, and hopefully BA will manage to have a Green day tomorrow so I can get into that Short at least above $320. :-)"

So...any thoughts round here on the proxy fight?
Dumped ASH in my 401K a couple of weeks ago. I missed a little bump but glad I got out now. ASH still it might be an interesting stock to follow through the breakup of the company later this year.
Received a tender offer from ASH for some of their bonds. The offer price was way to low and I declined it even though I would have made a profit.

"My next Pure Earnings play is going to be a Short Sell of ASH. Sometime on Monday, unless some huge news comes out that changes the market environment, I will be using most of my available hard capital to Sell Short this obscure chemical company that nobody on Yahoo ever posts about. Why? Because an extensive analysis shows it to be the most likely play to succeed and deliver a decent pay-out, among the companies that report earnings Monday AH/Tuesday PM. I expect ASH to miss consensus estimates on either EPS or Revenue, or both. Company has a very poor earnings history, they have missed at least one of these two measures, for the past six quarters. Despite these misses, company remains technically overvalued and is poised to drop on a miss. Analysts are, surprisingly, modestly bullish on this Baby. Company is planning to ""realign business operations"" in 2020:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ashland-ash-realign-business-operations-145802242.htmlSounds good, and long-term this stock might very well go up significantly. But not on Tuesday, IMO. I expect poor earnings and a 3-5% drop in stock price. Not expecting a huge move, but feeling very confident on the downside. Risk/reward ratio seems excellent to me. The other Pure Earnings trade I like VERY much this date, is HCA to the Long side. It was a very difficult decision, choosing ASH Short over HCA Long. But I only want to make one play at a time this year, using 95+% of my capital, and the ASH short just looks a LITTLE bit better. That said, HCA is definitely worthy of a Long play. I expect them to beat on both EPS and Revenue, and Guide higher. Stock has a good earnings history, stock is currently significantly undervalued. Company has a good amount of recent, positive news. Analysts are bullish. A detailed financial analysis shows very good parameters. The ONLY really negative thing I see, is a LOT of recent insider selling of shares, which CAN sometimes be a warning sign, but I really don't see that as being likely. Out of all Long choices Mon AH/Tue PM, HCA stands out to me as offering the best potential at the lowest risk. Of course all this is just my opinion. My advice is, do your own Due Diligence and research, and make your trading choices based on that. Best of Luck!"
"Still planing to Sell Short BA tomorrow. Stock is down today and articles like this show how much pressure Boeing is under, from several different fronts. https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-faa-approval-soon-q4-2019-earnings-preview/?src=A00220&yptr=yahooOptimists, and long-term investors in the company, say that Wednesday mornings almost guaranteed earnings miss is already priced into the stock. I don't buy it. I expect a huge miss of consensus estimates. The consensus on EPS is $1.73. I am expecting less than $1.40. Can BA go up upon a terrible earnings release, coupled with all existing negative and uncertain issues?? Of course it is possible. But in terms of risk/reward scenario, a BA Short Sell seems like the best play for this date, the play most likely to succeed. Just my opinion. :-)"

"RETIREES ARE SCREWED AGAIN BY THIS COMPANY!!!! Unfreakingbelievable! People work for these companies all their lives, and these corporate executives hurt them at the most vulnerable time in their lives!!!! Why the U.S. government isn't stopping this is fairly clear - because they are as corrupt and self-serving as the corporations who pay them off! My 87 yo father just received a letter from Ashland nonchalantly informing him that they are dropping his supplemental medical insurance. This should be against the law, and people in this country need to start demanding protection from these greedy executives!"
"I've finished my detailed analysis of potential Pure Earnings plays for Wed AH/Thurs PM, and all I can day is, ""whew!"" :-) I found a lot of stocks that look very good to the upside, almost nothing that looks good as a Short Sell. Trying to narrow down my list, but right now I still have 9, yes nine, that all look like they should go up on earnings release, and on a slow day I would be willing to play any of these 9. But this is a busy day, and I have to try to choose the best option, out of the nine. But not today. I'm tired, going to choose tomorrow or Tuesday. But anyway, here is my ""final cut"" list of 9, all to the Long side:ALGNCRUS FBLRCXPYPLQRVOALXNBIIBNOCRTNAt this moment I am very slightly favoring ALXN, with with LRCX and NOC tied for second, and FB third. But they are ALL so close, and all look really good. ALXN might seem like an odd choice here, but it is luring me in as a ""sleeper"" stock. There is something WRONG with her valuation. It is just TOO low, imo. Sometimes this happens, and it takes a very strong earnings report to ""wake up"" the market as to the undervaluation, and that is when we can get 10+% upside pops. I see that potential in ALXN. I am expecting an EXCELLENT ER, beats on EPS and Revenue along with good Guidance. I carefully analyzed the financial parameters of this company, and I see them as excellent. The stock is seriously undervalued right now. Analysts are almost all bullish, PT's give us BIG upside potential. Now, it is a pharma stock, and these stocks move more on drug approvals and other news directly related to their product pipeline, than they do on earnings reports. But still, I see this one as somehow standing out above the other 8 in terms of upside potential, while at the same time I also see it as slightly riskier a play than a few of the others. Any thoughts or opinions would be welcome and appreciated! :-)"

"Looks like this will not trade at all in the AH session, but I am still liking the odds of this going down tomorrow. ER is a little bit better than I was expecting, but still weak enough that this should go down in tomorrow's regular session."

"Covered my ASH Short at $77.70 for a loss of a little over $2.8k. That was a failed Pure Earnings Short Sell play. But if you are going to fail, it is much better to fail small than to fail big. I currently classify any single trade loss of less than $5k, as a Fail Small. It helped that the stock was somewhat overvalued, I think. Helped to limit the upside move. I ran out of patience at 11:30 AM, could have mitigated the loss a little more by holding on for a few more hours, as she did trend down in the afternoon. Oh well, it was time to cut bait and move on. :-) Currently Short 320 shares of BA at $316.60. Was hoping to do this Short Sell at $320+, but no such luck. I still feel very comfortable and confident with the play. I think BA will have a really bad ER before market open tomorrow, and it is still NOT priced into the current stock price. I expect a significant drop, at least to $305, and there is a decent chance the stock will go below $300. Of course I could be completely wrong, but I sure hope not, because two consecutive losing plays would be a bummer. Lets see what happens and best of luck to all! :-)"

"Sold Short 1300 shares of ASH at $75.52, about two hours ago. This is a Pure Earnings play. ASH reports quarterly earnings after market close today, and I am expecting poor numbers, a miss of consensus estimates on EPS, Revenue, or both, to be followed by a drop in the stock price. Not looking for a huge move here, but 3-5% to the downside seems like a reasonable expectation, and will be enough to make me happy. We shall see soon enough, earnings are expected to be released at around 4:35 PM ET, just how very dumb, or extremely smart, this play will turn out to be. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
