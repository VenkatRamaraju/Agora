Well divy was cut 35%. Let’s see the impact today. Hopefully my gains r not wiped out waiting for my dividend. Fingers crossed. But I already know what will happen.
"Just added another 1,200 shares at $17.21. Puts me to 4,800 shares - so dividend is getting to be a nice chunk of change. ...next but in for me is at $16’ish if it ever gets that low again (unlikely)"
"I will be interested to see if there were any inside buys on Friday, August 6 at those low stock prices."
"This is from 3rd quarter ""The distribution coverage ratio(1) for full-year 2018 is expected to be slightly below 1.0x. The distribution coverage ratio(1) for full-year 2018 is expected to be slightly below 1.0x. "" Also they lowered guidance to 110-120 on 3rd quarter then this from Pres. and CEO ""As a result, Sprague expects full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA to be below our previously updated guidance of $110 to $120 million and our distribution coverage to be below 1.0x. He then goes on to say "" believe that the drivers behind this decline are challenges that Sprague will be able to manage through incremental growth and continued cost management initiatives in 2019, together with normal weather and market structure assumptions. I would say there is zero chance that they pay out 17 % dist. I`m guessing they reduce to 10 %. GLP did same thing a few years back .SDLP will be at 11 by tomorrow noon ."
Too much uncertainty over ownership and distribution cut. Wasn't it a year or so ago they wanted to buy all shares at a discount to market? Market doesn't like questions with no answers.
Is it worth buying now at $15.2?
Distribution MAINTAINED!!
Ended up picking up shares at $15.08 yesterday in a limit order.
"Well since I am long term investor and made all my monthly purchase over two weeks ago, wish I had a bit to shove at SRLP on a down day. Oh well, feet up, coffee is hot and good, waiting for that dividend to hit again."
"With the new .4338 quarterly distribution the yield on SRLP is about 9% which is still a nice distribution for those investors buying at today's price. As Kenneth noted, the cut in our distribution was somewhat less than expected. Management warned of a distribution cut at Q2 so any intelligent investor took heed to that warning and might have anticipated a drop in our share price during Q3. If you own SRLP at @29.00 your yield was just reduced to about 6%, rather than the 9% that new investors are receiving today. From my personal perspective, I sold 5500 of my units at about 21.25 (avg.) and held on to 2500 units. My 2020 K1 indicates that I owned my 8000 units at $9.07 and I did not wish to sell all of my shares this year which would trigger the dreaded day of reckoning for logging my capital gains on SRLP. I expect we will see a further decline in our share prices after ex-div date and before the end of the year as some investors will choose to engage in some tax loss selling of SRLP but some of those losses will likely recuperate in 2022.I am not so much concerned about the dividend cut or even the drop in our share price as I will still be receiving a $1084.50 quarterly distribution and I may or may not decide to ever sell my remaining 2500 units. What concerns me most is what Hartree Partners plans are for SRLP. They are not a corporation or an MLP. ""Hartree is jointly owned by its senior management and certain funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P."" As such, they do not have a fiduciary responsibility to anyone but themselves. As I understand, Hartree is a UK based company with trading offices around the world so SRLP is no longer a USA based company. I expect that the SRLP MLP will eventually be bought out and absorbed entirely by Hartree and as they hold controlling interest I suspect that SRLP limited partners will not likely be paid any or much of a premium. IMHO there are better investments in the energy industry than SRLP. Look forward to more insight on the conference call on Nov 3rd concerning Hartree's future plans. Cheers!"
It seems that someone who is not satisfied with the low offering may file a class action suit. there needs to be some weighted average buyout price that matches the unit price over the past year or two.
"DAVE GLENDON, CEO, owns 123,649 shares....and he has SOLD NONE. THIS IS TOTALLY OVERSOLD."
Stock has no staying power.
"All the headlines have been bullish for oil prices,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.""U.S. stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected draw, three of India's refiners are operating almost at 100% capacity, indicating crude demand remains strong, and it seems the U.S. will continue to deliver more monetary and fiscal stimulus, sending the dollar lower and most commodities higher."""
$16 a unit is what Hartree and Oaktree paid for the entire GP.
"Anyone with shares got their dividend this morning, please check to see if the dividend is correct, I was short $ 500.00,"
Stockholders not happy about distribution cut to use for capital improvement. Long run will be good but board of directors better watch out for their jobs especially if investment does not work.
Sprague expects to maintain the 2019 quarterly distributions at the current distribution level of $0.6675 per unit. NICE
"10% owner of SRLP buys 16,058,484 shares at average price of $16.50 for a total purchase of $264,964,986 on May 28th! Does this owner have conviction in this stock or not?"
"Valuation based on earnings and distribution is out. I'm out. No range provided to investors for the distribution cut. Funds are needed for new and exciting opportunities away from fossil fuel revenue sources. Possibly a good long-term strategy. But off-shore windmills can be expense, borrowing will be needed, and it will take awhile before the any such investment provides a return. Meanwhile, increased borrowing costs will eat into earnings. I think bad news is hard to put out, and that's why no distribution range (payout or cut) was provided to placate investors in face of todays dramatic hit to the stock's price this morning."
"What I found out is my broker bought a block before my dividend arrive. The stock drop on friday, before the dividend arrive to my account. when the dividend arrive, they use that block of share and give it to me, didn't expecting a 30% lost from dividend. is this a SEC complaint issue?"
Is the philly refiner fire today somehow beneficial to SRLP thus explaining the almost 4% raise today ??
"Love the dividend, bought another 1500 shares yesterday!"
"I made some estimates and assumptions and came up with a $.455 quarterly dividend going forward, which is a 32% cut and would save them about $22 mil annualized; half that in 2021 since it is just 2 quarters. I believe they said their expansion capital for 2020 was $3.8 mil, so $22 mil would leave a lot of cash available for growth projects, and perhaps other purposes. My guess is the new owner/sponsor wants to use cash to buy back units and increase their ownership ratio. I can share my calcs if some are interested in helping evaluate or tweak this. I am not real confident on it, but it is an assumption going forward to help evaluate buy/sell/hold. On the call they attributed the weak performance to Q2 and Q3 being typically weak quarters, and Q1, Q4 being stronger, but said the results were not out of line with expectations. Although their expectations and our expectations might not be the same. They said they were holding their 2021 EBITDA projection at the range of $105 mil to $120 mil."
How does this work in a Roth IRA? Dividends are taxable but share gains are not?
"Hartree is looking at ""Green"" energy investments, which is the future whether we like it or not. But it is NOT a money maker today. I anticipate the infrastructure spending to tank the SP and this go private again within a year"
"A very cold winter will drive this baby up up up, I'm buying more."
"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/axel-johnson-inc-agrees-sell-201500903.htmlThey said ""You dont want our 13 dollar buy out offer cool we will sell for 23 ourselves haha """
I`d love to see the list of sellers today including relatives/friends of employees .This was down almost a buck on big volume before a little recovery . I don`t think earnings will be close .
"We were told a cut was coming in the last earnings conference call. Not a surprise at all, except the cut was smaller that I expected. The new owners of the MLP are experts in this sector."
EBITDA up 60% YOY. That’s extremely encouraging. Dividend maintained and still generating cash for other opportunities. I don’t understand how this stays under $20 but I don’t care. Keep giving me these great dividends and opportunities to buy more shares with a 15% yield - thank you.
Has anyone been a longterm holder of this stock? I am considering it for the dividends. It seems like they've paid a dividend consistently.
Well picked up another block at 18.12. Seems like it might have been at the right time.
"Miki, I'm a newbie just bought a 1,000 shares, is this a good thing, or bad thing?If it's a bad thing you can blame me."
Looks like a beat to me (.43 loss vs .48 est. loss. Maintaining distribution. I'll take it .
Added at 17.35.
"This is a cash generator. For a business at this maturity level cash is more important than earnings. They are doing a great job and the dividend stays intact. A 16% yield will self correct, meaning the stock price will continue to increase.The encouraging news is the growth outside of heating oil. This is good diversification for SRLP and less volatile. That said, it also doesn't hurt that 2019 has started out with a lot of very cold days here in the North. I expect they'll have very good results to report for the Q1 close. Don't bet on this stock staying below $18 by April. I think it's more likely it's over $20 after Q1 results are posted."
"The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 11. That compared with the average decline of 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. This shows demand, which is counter to OPEC article, which is a boost for oil prices, which tends to trend with Sprague....but it's not currently translating to that??"
Sprague announces a cash distribution of $0.6675 per unit
I sold 5500 units earlier this month at $21.00- 21.50. If the distribution comes in at less than .40 for the 3rd quarter I will sell my remaining 2500 shares. Cheers!
