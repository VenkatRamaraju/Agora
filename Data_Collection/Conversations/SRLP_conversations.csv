"Just added another 1,200 shares at $17.21. Puts me to 4,800 shares - so dividend is getting to be a nice chunk of change. ...next but in for me is at $16’ish if it ever gets that low again (unlikely)"
How does this work in a Roth IRA? Dividends are taxable but share gains are not?
"What I found out is my broker bought a block before my dividend arrive. The stock drop on friday, before the dividend arrive to my account. when the dividend arrive, they use that block of share and give it to me, didn't expecting a 30% lost from dividend. is this a SEC complaint issue?"

EBITDA up 60% YOY. That’s extremely encouraging. Dividend maintained and still generating cash for other opportunities. I don’t understand how this stays under $20 but I don’t care. Keep giving me these great dividends and opportunities to buy more shares with a 15% yield - thank you.

Wow - dipped under $16 again. ...bought more. Keep this dividend going!! ...almost has me wishing for a cold winter.
I sold 5500 units earlier this month at $21.00- 21.50. If the distribution comes in at less than .40 for the 3rd quarter I will sell my remaining 2500 shares. Cheers!

Looks like a beat to me (.43 loss vs .48 est. loss. Maintaining distribution. I'll take it .
looks like Dividend of .6675 (3.8% of current price 17.20) to holders on 4th February
Kept divvy the same . Great news . Things couldn`t be too bad .
"Well SRLP isn't up, its not down. No news is good news?"
"So there it is-from down .41cents to flat---but that's not good enough, oil is up, and has been up so the stock price should surpass the 19.88 yearly high again soon. HUGE spread on this market makers bid/ask really ridiculous since the volumes so low. This extraordinary dividend and real earnings growth will kick up the volume."

That was strange action from SRLP....
Ended up picking up shares at $15.08 yesterday in a limit order.
It seems that someone who is not satisfied with the low offering may file a class action suit. there needs to be some weighted average buyout price that matches the unit price over the past year or two.

"Love the dividend, bought another 1500 shares yesterday!"
"I made some estimates and assumptions and came up with a $.455 quarterly dividend going forward, which is a 32% cut and would save them about $22 mil annualized; half that in 2021 since it is just 2 quarters. I believe they said their expansion capital for 2020 was $3.8 mil, so $22 mil would leave a lot of cash available for growth projects, and perhaps other purposes. My guess is the new owner/sponsor wants to use cash to buy back units and increase their ownership ratio. I can share my calcs if some are interested in helping evaluate or tweak this. I am not real confident on it, but it is an assumption going forward to help evaluate buy/sell/hold. On the call they attributed the weak performance to Q2 and Q3 being typically weak quarters, and Q1, Q4 being stronger, but said the results were not out of line with expectations. Although their expectations and our expectations might not be the same. They said they were holding their 2021 EBITDA projection at the range of $105 mil to $120 mil."
That is the most half-hearted take out offer I have witnessed. GET REAL GUYS
One problem I notice is EBITDA is reduced making the debt burden worse. Could become serious if rates go higher.
looks like they beat with a 30 cent loss vs estimates of 44 cent loss . distribution same. In line with expectations...good enough . I agree with not a lot of shares traded. Put buy limit and maybe snag some cheap.

"This is a cash generator. For a business at this maturity level cash is more important than earnings. They are doing a great job and the dividend stays intact. A 16% yield will self correct, meaning the stock price will continue to increase.The encouraging news is the growth outside of heating oil. This is good diversification for SRLP and less volatile. That said, it also doesn't hurt that 2019 has started out with a lot of very cold days here in the North. I expect they'll have very good results to report for the Q1 close. Don't bet on this stock staying below $18 by April. I think it's more likely it's over $20 after Q1 results are posted."
Is the philly refiner fire today somehow beneficial to SRLP thus explaining the almost 4% raise today ??

be careful the market price of this stock might be below $16 a share before the next dividend is declared.

"Valuation based on earnings and distribution is out. I'm out. No range provided to investors for the distribution cut. Funds are needed for new and exciting opportunities away from fossil fuel revenue sources. Possibly a good long-term strategy. But off-shore windmills can be expense, borrowing will be needed, and it will take awhile before the any such investment provides a return. Meanwhile, increased borrowing costs will eat into earnings. I think bad news is hard to put out, and that's why no distribution range (payout or cut) was provided to placate investors in face of todays dramatic hit to the stock's price this morning."

Too much uncertainty over ownership and distribution cut. Wasn't it a year or so ago they wanted to buy all shares at a discount to market? Market doesn't like questions with no answers.

$13? No thanks.
Sprague expects to maintain the 2019 quarterly distributions at the current distribution level of $0.6675 per unit. NICE
earning looks really bad
Taken down before the completion of the acquision. I believe that the share price gains above the purchase price would have been taxable income to the buyer so the company came up with the divvy cut to mask the takedown. Note they started taking it down before the cut announcement was public info. Leaked to the right people? This stinks to high heaven.
"With the new .4338 quarterly distribution the yield on SRLP is about 9% which is still a nice distribution for those investors buying at today's price. As Kenneth noted, the cut in our distribution was somewhat less than expected. Management warned of a distribution cut at Q2 so any intelligent investor took heed to that warning and might have anticipated a drop in our share price during Q3. If you own SRLP at @29.00 your yield was just reduced to about 6%, rather than the 9% that new investors are receiving today. From my personal perspective, I sold 5500 of my units at about 21.25 (avg.) and held on to 2500 units. My 2020 K1 indicates that I owned my 8000 units at $9.07 and I did not wish to sell all of my shares this year which would trigger the dreaded day of reckoning for logging my capital gains on SRLP. I expect we will see a further decline in our share prices after ex-div date and before the end of the year as some investors will choose to engage in some tax loss selling of SRLP but some of those losses will likely recuperate in 2022.I am not so much concerned about the dividend cut or even the drop in our share price as I will still be receiving a $1084.50 quarterly distribution and I may or may not decide to ever sell my remaining 2500 units. What concerns me most is what Hartree Partners plans are for SRLP. They are not a corporation or an MLP. ""Hartree is jointly owned by its senior management and certain funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P."" As such, they do not have a fiduciary responsibility to anyone but themselves. As I understand, Hartree is a UK based company with trading offices around the world so SRLP is no longer a USA based company. I expect that the SRLP MLP will eventually be bought out and absorbed entirely by Hartree and as they hold controlling interest I suspect that SRLP limited partners will not likely be paid any or much of a premium. IMHO there are better investments in the energy industry than SRLP. Look forward to more insight on the conference call on Nov 3rd concerning Hartree's future plans. Cheers!"
