Is it worth buying now at $15.2?
"So there it is-from down .41cents to flat---but that's not good enough, oil is up, and has been up so the stock price should surpass the 19.88 yearly high again soon. HUGE spread on this market makers bid/ask really ridiculous since the volumes so low. This extraordinary dividend and real earnings growth will kick up the volume."

I just bought 265 stocks for the next pay out dividend. What is your experience with this stock?
Sprague Resources is up 6.49% to 13.30
Taken down before the completion of the acquision. I believe that the share price gains above the purchase price would have been taxable income to the buyer so the company came up with the divvy cut to mask the takedown. Note they started taking it down before the cut announcement was public info. Leaked to the right people? This stinks to high heaven.

"I purchased this stock last month. I bought it to hold for some income, looked like it may have a good chance to grow. With the weather that has hit the northeast this week, it should add to the bottom line. Is there any one that has researched and bought this stock? Would like for you to share your opinion. Thanks."

Stock has no staying power.
"Tax-Free Retirement with a Roth IRAThe beauty of the Roth IRA is that all account growth—whether from interest, dividends or distributions—is 100 percent tax free. You get the interest, dividends and even capital gains without having to pay additional tax on them, as you would in a regular investment account."
do they allow drips?
I`d love to see the list of sellers today including relatives/friends of employees .This was down almost a buck on big volume before a little recovery . I don`t think earnings will be close .
"The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 11. That compared with the average decline of 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. This shows demand, which is counter to OPEC article, which is a boost for oil prices, which tends to trend with Sprague....but it's not currently translating to that??"
Sprague Resources is up 6.24% to 18.23
Canada border strike more delays in transport?
How does this work in a Roth IRA? Dividends are taxable but share gains are not?
"Slow pace, no news, not a lot of red downer days. Dividend! This is a very quiet board."
SRLP is down -5.66% to 24.20
EBITDA up 60% YOY. That’s extremely encouraging. Dividend maintained and still generating cash for other opportunities. I don’t understand how this stays under $20 but I don’t care. Keep giving me these great dividends and opportunities to buy more shares with a 15% yield - thank you.
I’ve seen a lot. I’ve not seen SPA like this.
Negative 2.16 pre-market?
Look out below ... #$%$3
"I wish management was clear, cut the dividend or keep it.....the stockholders have taken a 20% hit due to confusion on managements thoughts. What is it? CUT or KEEP"

"Two weeks to earnings. Here's my prediction: Report a GAAP loss, cash flow positive, and maintain dividend. ...no going out on a linb there - that's been the quarterly results for 2 years now."
"All the headlines have been bullish for oil prices,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.""U.S. stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected draw, three of India's refiners are operating almost at 100% capacity, indicating crude demand remains strong, and it seems the U.S. will continue to deliver more monetary and fiscal stimulus, sending the dollar lower and most commodities higher."""
"I'm out. $25.53. ...made a very small gain (could've been worse this week) and got a couple dividend payments. ...would've liked to hold for next payment but I think the downside risk is higher than the 67 cents a share. The language around changing capital usage indicates a significant drop in the dividend. To me, the attraction here was the dividend, if that drops dramatically I see the SP going down quite a bit as well"
"What I found out is my broker bought a block before my dividend arrive. The stock drop on friday, before the dividend arrive to my account. when the dividend arrive, they use that block of share and give it to me, didn't expecting a 30% lost from dividend. is this a SEC complaint issue?"
Terrific. Potential dividend slash. Wondered why this thing collapsed this morning.
"This is from 3rd quarter ""The distribution coverage ratio(1) for full-year 2018 is expected to be slightly below 1.0x. The distribution coverage ratio(1) for full-year 2018 is expected to be slightly below 1.0x. "" Also they lowered guidance to 110-120 on 3rd quarter then this from Pres. and CEO ""As a result, Sprague expects full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA to be below our previously updated guidance of $110 to $120 million and our distribution coverage to be below 1.0x. He then goes on to say "" believe that the drivers behind this decline are challenges that Sprague will be able to manage through incremental growth and continued cost management initiatives in 2019, together with normal weather and market structure assumptions. I would say there is zero chance that they pay out 17 % dist. I`m guessing they reduce to 10 %. GLP did same thing a few years back .SDLP will be at 11 by tomorrow noon ."
SRLP is up 5.04% to 25.00
"Something strange going on...up $2 plus, then suddenly, dropping back to up $1.20. All within 20 minutes of open. -Scott"
"I made some estimates and assumptions and came up with a $.455 quarterly dividend going forward, which is a 32% cut and would save them about $22 mil annualized; half that in 2021 since it is just 2 quarters. I believe they said their expansion capital for 2020 was $3.8 mil, so $22 mil would leave a lot of cash available for growth projects, and perhaps other purposes. My guess is the new owner/sponsor wants to use cash to buy back units and increase their ownership ratio. I can share my calcs if some are interested in helping evaluate or tweak this. I am not real confident on it, but it is an assumption going forward to help evaluate buy/sell/hold. On the call they attributed the weak performance to Q2 and Q3 being typically weak quarters, and Q1, Q4 being stronger, but said the results were not out of line with expectations. Although their expectations and our expectations might not be the same. They said they were holding their 2021 EBITDA projection at the range of $105 mil to $120 mil."
"Well since I am long term investor and made all my monthly purchase over two weeks ago, wish I had a bit to shove at SRLP on a down day. Oh well, feet up, coffee is hot and good, waiting for that dividend to hit again."

SRLP is up 5.41% to 11.89
Too much uncertainty over ownership and distribution cut. Wasn't it a year or so ago they wanted to buy all shares at a discount to market? Market doesn't like questions with no answers.
"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/axel-johnson-inc-agrees-sell-201500903.htmlThey said ""You dont want our 13 dollar buy out offer cool we will sell for 23 ourselves haha """

"Run the CL=F oil symbol and see that Sprague stock mimics the oil chart, so we see where that went. Sprague 26 in 4 weeks."
"Hartree/Oaktree purchased 69.3% of the units (18,156,600 units) for $290,000,000.00 (or $16.00 a unit). Get it today at a discount to the General Partner’s share price."

"No cut in dividend!!, this stock should be worth $30"

"oil has gone up and keeps going up,and it looks like over $50 a barrel is in the horizon, and when yourun chart with SRLP and oil you will also see oil drags the price with it."
SELL SELL SELL. by the time the next quarterly report rolls around this stock will be down to $15.

Does anyone have a clue where this stock is headed? Managements cryptic message has created so much uncertainty that we have to wait and see what direction they want to take the company. I am actually surprised that there have not been any law suits filed.
Up 6% today. WHY??

"Revenues way down , makes sense since it's been very warm first quarter . Beat by 80 cents . And shares are flat. Anyone know a good lawyer to sue these people. Trying to buy our shares at $13 ?

SRLP is down 5.06% to $18.56
"what an amazing turn of events! value looked good when I bought in at 17, then after the drop I did a little more digging. read the call. doubled down under 15. here is my reasoning, first, I like the insider owner percentage, this company has revenue, and the ceo kinda lead me to believe that the parent is more than willing to help out with distribution coverage or at least not worried about the coverage issue,, and that things aren't all that bad. now im guessing that something leaked to the tune the div wont be cut or something..."

Has anyone been a longterm holder of this stock? I am considering it for the dividends. It seems like they've paid a dividend consistently.

"the term ""headwinds"" should never be said by the ceo"
"This is a cash generator. For a business at this maturity level cash is more important than earnings. They are doing a great job and the dividend stays intact. A 16% yield will self correct, meaning the stock price will continue to increase.The encouraging news is the growth outside of heating oil. This is good diversification for SRLP and less volatile. That said, it also doesn't hurt that 2019 has started out with a lot of very cold days here in the North. I expect they'll have very good results to report for the Q1 close. Don't bet on this stock staying below $18 by April. I think it's more likely it's over $20 after Q1 results are posted."
Any one hear in comments about the dividend going forward in the conference call today ?
Dividend announcement should be this week . Should be interesting . Probably a cut .
Sprague announces a cash distribution of $0.6675 per unit
"Love the dividend, bought another 1500 shares yesterday!"
looks like they beat with a 30 cent loss vs estimates of 44 cent loss . distribution same. In line with expectations...good enough . I agree with not a lot of shares traded. Put buy limit and maybe snag some cheap.
"Sprague Resources Holdings LLC, Director by Deputization of Sprague Resources LP bought 723738 shares on 2020-06-05. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=SRLP"

Any clue why this is going south?

"10% owner of SRLP buys 16,058,484 shares at average price of $16.50 for a total purchase of $264,964,986 on May 28th! Does this owner have conviction in this stock or not?"
"I will be interested to see if there were any inside buys on Friday, August 6 at those low stock prices."
$16 a unit is what Hartree and Oaktree paid for the entire GP.
Looks like a beat to me (.43 loss vs .48 est. loss. Maintaining distribution. I'll take it .

"This company does not depend on oil price. They got business whether the price goes up or down. The peak of his business is in winter,because the heating oil sales."
One problem I notice is EBITDA is reduced making the debt burden worse. Could become serious if rates go higher.
$13 offer yielding 20% is a joke. I can see an offer of $26 for 10% yield
"Valuation based on earnings and distribution is out. I'm out. No range provided to investors for the distribution cut. Funds are needed for new and exciting opportunities away from fossil fuel revenue sources. Possibly a good long-term strategy. But off-shore windmills can be expense, borrowing will be needed, and it will take awhile before the any such investment provides a return. Meanwhile, increased borrowing costs will eat into earnings. I think bad news is hard to put out, and that's why no distribution range (payout or cut) was provided to placate investors in face of todays dramatic hit to the stock's price this morning."
"Damn, there you go - under $16 like some were saying. I bought more at $15.56. As long as the dividend stays where it’s at this will be a steal. ...as long as"

"Wow. Cleared my computer and was able to read a little of the stalking cat freak jills posts. She said I claimed to have bought srlp 2 days before the big drop. Lie, I didn’t even know the company existed. Only reason I knew is by the percentage loss. So I bought 1k shares, even though that stank Jill will say otherwise. The day of the big drop just for the bounce. Well it fell more the next day and I was down like 4K. See Jill, I can throw 20k on a roll do the dice, sorry u can’t and also have a mortgage too, but since u disgust me I’m actually not. Anyway I’m up 1k now so we 7 see what I want to do. Sad u have to buy blocks of 25 shares when I buy blocks do 500/1000. Now shut ur stink hole, feed your cats and do ur stupid thumb down, because blocked ur are as well as Lucifer."
"I sold this bad boy based on an article. Then watched it go $8 higher. Maybe the writer was right after all. Anyway I'll wait til the dust settles, see what happens to the div, and decide whether or not to get back in again."
"Just added another 1,200 shares at $17.21. Puts me to 4,800 shares - so dividend is getting to be a nice chunk of change. ...next but in for me is at $16’ish if it ever gets that low again (unlikely)"
