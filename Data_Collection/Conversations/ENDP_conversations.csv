Waiting on a settlement so this well run company can finally be free to grow without bound. Without this overhang they are $12-$15 billion EV company - ex debt and cash that’s about $6-$7 billion in cap or $20-$30/shr.
"Hmm! The stock has been on a steady incline. They have amazing fundamentals. A company with growing earnings. I know people like to invest in all these wannabes. The potential for ENDP is off the charts. I am not a pumper. Just like what I see. If this opiod mess fades, you know the stock will rise."
"A blurb in Barrons this morning doesn't help......... Endo International (ENDP) , a maker of branded and generic drugs, trades for just two times projected 2022 earnings because of high debt and opioid liabilities. Shares were recently around $5.The company's market value of $1 billion is dwarfed by its net debt of more than $6 billion. J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott has an Underweight rating on the stock, citing recently ""high leverage"" and ""pending opioid liabilities (with no apparent end in sight)."""
Qwo 1 billion mkt by 2024
"Just bought 4,000 more shares."
"Good or bad?Maltese recommended against barring Arnold & Porter from representing Endo, against barring a particular partner from representing Endo, and against referring the partner for discipline.Arnold & Porter gave this statement to Reuters: “While we do not agree with all of the statements made in this report, we are gratified that the referee rejected the vast majority of plaintiffs’ unfounded allegations and attacks on the integrity of our firm.”"
"So ""Dopesick"" does not appear to be taking an angle that will wash over onto ENDO, JnJ or Teva. It is really da#@#$%$ of Curtis Wright the former FDA Director that granted labeling indicating that OXY was non addictive and then went on to receive more than $400,000 as an employee of the Sacklers. Also, it focusses on the intense sales pressure on the Purdue Reps and the marketing of ever increasing strength product. On a whole I think the 1st 4 episodes will have no affect on ENDO. Some may argue it is a positive since it shows FDA was complicit in the Oxy epidemic. Furthermore, it shows that the typical Country Dr. played by Keaton knew opioids were addictive and therefore required care when prescribing. The problem was the Dr's that are portrayed as ""whales"" since they prescribed a tremendous number of oxy scripts and then received perks from Purdue. FL"
Just buy...
"I am not afraid of success, so I am buying as much as I can before the settlement news and progress on qwo."
"Richietim said today ""we are heading back to 3's"". Of course he also said we were heading to the $1's when he sold his virtual position at $2.11, lol!!Heading higher for sure now now that wrong way Richietim chimed in!"
"Hey, @Max @Duff @Albert how are you guys? Do we know the reason for the drop or can we just chalk it to an overreaction on one/two hit pieces being bought out?I feel like you guys somewhat like I don't want to get on name-calling and debating but sharing ideas for investment, so I thought i will ask you the question"
"i literally can't stand the incessant pumping posters put up: news for you, 83% institutional ownership does not imply FAITH in a stock it implies a non stop , interest bearing , money making opportunity that is colluded and manipulated all day every day. looks like more of the same today as yesterday...the assault on the pps is definitely systematic.Manipulation to try and shake as many shares loose as possible continues...this plunge makes no sense with what should be happening in the next week or so.Dont set any stop loss orders with the mms or you will lose your shares.Remember a vast majority of the shares here are held by funds....that shows a lot of faith in ENDP by them and USUALLY they are successful with their holdings in the long run.Hang in there for the next few days until news hits or imo you will wish you had."
I'm guessing $ENDP and $TEVA are both down because yesterday a bankruptcy judge declined to pause litigation in the JNJ talc cases in which it is attempting to move the assets to a separate company that is going to file Chapter 11 to force a settlement. This tactic is being watched closely by all involved in Opioid litigation as it offers more pressure for settlement if it works for JNJ.
Max and Rich thanks again for your shares in the 2s. When it hits 10 Max will scream again I should have bought more when it was low. Like last year
"Novavax'filed for UK vax approval yesterday. I know that ENDO has an agreement to provide fill finish manufacturing out of Rochester Michigan. Is the Rochester facility the only one likely to provide services?The UK has been heavily dependent on the GSK vaccine which exhibits effectiveness similar to JnJ (60-70% range), NVAX represents an improvement. However, It seems like most of the future demand will be in the Emerging and frontier markets.FL"
Bought 50k more
"Lol...4.36 to red....after 6 years I do wonder how ( even with opioids ) the market sees this as a 4 dollar stock from $89. on its surface you'd have to assume 100% chance of BK to knock it down to single digits and keep it there now for years. meaning, the question is , WHO is selling this at these fire sale levels?!"
CCXI has a market cap of almost 2.5 billion. They just had there drug approved. It may eventually gross 1 billion in sales each year. The stock is currently about $34.50. Endo will have sales of at least 2.7 billion in 2021. Could be more with new generic drug Chantix hitting the market in September. It has the potential to gross 640 million a year. Undervalued is an under statement. They could generate 3 billion this year. Stock could easily blow past $30 a share or more.
This is up 116% in the past 6 weeks. Impressive ... but still a long way to go yet. Uptrend in place but needs a favorable ruling from Wilson in CA to confirm it. Once CA is settled the other states will likely start falling in line.
