All the new posters on this board over last 2 days are shorts trying to cover.. They need sellers to cover. Where were they over last months.. Its now they want to close near bottom. Don't give away your shares.. Vasostrict on Generic entrant net year will loose 10 to 20% share and similar amount on price for year 1 and 2.
Gap up Monday with news??
"Even with bankruptcy, the company is making a lot of money each quarter, they have the ability to pay their bills. I just don't see it. New York will now be a precedent. It is the second most populous state."
"Whats more helpful in determining short interest impact is to look at the number of shares available to short. Iborrowdesk provides this, and endp closed last night with 7m shares available to short. Currently there are 6.3m as of 10:55est so already today we've seen 700k in short volume either sold or borrowed. When large funds borrow shares short they don't actually have to go short, they have up to 3 days to either execute the short or return the borrowed shares. So not all 700k were necessarily sold already but if the share price can weather the new short positions without major decline that's a strong sign."
"Torian Mitchell: “Whatever the New York AG is either hoping to find or thinks that Endo has been hiding, the thing that stands out to me in all of that is that when you look at the state of Oklahoma, when you look at the state of Ohio, Endo was literally given a pat on the back … in terms of the way they have handled the case, the way they have been forthright, the way that they have opened their books … participated and cooperated with investigations, and have done so preemptively … New York has been in the mix the entire time. What are they hoping to discover that Ohio and Oklahoma have not been able to discover? Additionally, what do they think that Endo would be able to produce in terms of monetary settlement or judgement that is going to be bigger than a Mallinckrodt … that’s going to be bigger than Johnson & Johnson? Endo is by far the smallest player. Endo is the smallest player even when we compare it to Teva. I constantly look at things in terms of an ROI. If I can take $2 to earn $1,000 … if it takes me $996 to earn $1,000 then the ROI is not as attractive. At this point the state AG is taking $999 to earn $1,000. What is the ROI here that they are expecting after all of the effort? You’re dragging this thing out … You have already captured $30 billion, yet you continue to drag this thing out. If you look at the infighting between DeBlasio and Cuomo over the last four to five years … one of the things that we quickly learn is that New York state has been largely cash-strapped … the New York residents who have been affected and largely impacted by the opioid crisis, continue to drag out the help that they need.”"
"Not a good day for the doom and gloom crowd, again."
"Coupon 6.00 mature date 6/30/2028 is trading at ~74+ today, was trading at ~64- a month ago"
Jt. Added another 4000 shares @ $2.15 a share early Sept. Nice run. Hope it continues.
Look at the after-hours trading... someone is buying huge numbers of shares @ the closing price of $2.66. There is a strange transfer of shares going on...
What's more rewarding....quadrupling your money on ENDP because you bought at ~$3 when it's $12 OR knowing that a portion of that profit used to belong to the ignorant short richie-tim? I can't decide!
Splittin’ richie-Timmy-Rissy’s ENDO wide open today!
Endo was said to be back to $100 if opioid lawsuits ended. Is that still a possibility or perhaps $50 is more realistic?
"Texas two step, if Johnson can get away with it, why not Endo? Maybe that is what they hired the restructuring advisors for. “They claim their product is safe and then attempt to hide behind bankruptcy. J&J can run but it can’t hide.”"
"Chantix misstep and ENDP's generic substitute, could be ENDP's get out of bankruptcy free card. Depending how long JNJ takes to get it right, this could be quite an infusion of cash."
A dearth of evidence for plaintiff in CA case. Shorts you are put on notice. Gonna give you a big squeeze
"Jt: Please stop the infighting and insults. If you have an opinion or know something that would benefit others both pro and con, please share it, but stop the sophomoric insults."
"This volume is absolutely phenomenal. With 233.5 million shares outstanding, we had over 116 million shares traded today."

Holding endo strong. I sold my Chinese stocks today and also sold BROS. Made pretty good profits.
Bankruptcy: when a company is unable to meet massive debt payments due to weak profits and deteriorated earnings.
you can tell you strike a nerve with mike/Jedd when he starts posting with fake EricinPDX ..... karma is wonderful.How many shares over $12 do you have left from 5 years ago mike/Jedd? 5000 or more? Karma is wonderful.
"Exta-chromosome-timmy defending his GME and ENDP and DDOG short while spelling (Teva) ""Eva"", ""Timmy like Eva"" haha"
Buy ENDP asap with good news and Hold !
When Teva was $10 Endo was $6. could set a watch to it. Now Teva is $10 and Endo is $3. There are rats on board Endo mgmt. Even a reorg that doesn't Ch11 will still be seen as hugely negative. I witnessed a biotech SPAC yesterday that was up 11% pre and finished the day 5% red. MNK had tons of -5% days too many to not be suspicious...and we know how it went.
"I do not think ENDO is headed to Chtr 11 BK. Trying to reorganize ENDO under Chpt 11 would be difficult, if not impossible. The Court is obligated to try to secure the best payment terms possible for creditors (banks, employee pension, plaintifs in lawsuits etc.). Even if ENDO secured good terms for debtor in possession financing to try to emerge, big pharma and genetic competitors will swoop down to acquire the unburdened branded assets like QWO. Therefore, I don't think ENDO could emerge from BK as a stand alone entity. Fore this reason, I don't think management wants to go down that road. More likely the the restructuring advisors are evaluating something similar to the JnJ strategy of splitting profitable portions of the business from the liabilities or are posturing to use such a strategy to drive settlement in the opioid litigation. If push comes to shove they can pull the trigger on such a move and guarantee years of litigation to untangle it. Any such split could be vulnerable to claims of fraudulent conveyance. Kerr McGee -Tronox was an example of this strategy collapsing after years of litigation. This would almost guarantee that the attorneys would be the only ones getting paid.I see settlement before this happens.https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/case-summary-court-decision-tronox-bankruptcy-fraudulent-conveyance-case-results-largestFL"
"Rich and his thoughtless, baseless, unintelligible conjecture to start the day! It’s idiotic posts like his that reassure me I’ve made the right decision in going long ENDP! I’m only up $4k as of today but after reading 2-3 of his nonsensical s posts this morning…I’m sure ENDO will be at $12 by January. Therefore, I’m raising my price target to $20 by June, 2022 - based solely on the anti-ignorant strategy I’ve developed."
"It looks like ENDP earned about $2.65 in the last 4 quarters. This is over 600 million for this period. They projected 2.8 in sales for 2021. So, business is growing. Market cap is currently 650 million. Even at $10 a share, market cap is only 2.3 billion. Granted, 6.5 billion is a lot of debt, but, manageable. It seems that states will come to the table after NY agreement. Risk/reward seems quite good. I have to imagine that this company is easily worth $10 a share."
"look at Richietim pretend he knows what he's talking about, lol!!He predicted a ""$300 million NY judgement"".He predicted ""$1's after he sold his virtual ENDP position at $2.10, andHE SHORTED 2 LOTS OF GME AT $4!!!!"
news over at twits that endo bought 50MM shares between 1.97-2.09. can any one substantiate or is it another sad story?
"If Blaise is really smart they will come up with a global settlement, even if it is $2-$3B and when the stock jumps, use the previously filed S3 to issues new shares to pay for it, problem solved."

Great spot to get in
"Trying to pull IQVIA data for Varenicline sales data once it’s available. But from stock prices now, it may indicate a very positive sign there along with maybhe upcoming CA ruling."
Here is a guess. California settles with ENDP for $150M in cash by the end of the week.

"(Bloomberg) -- Endo International Plc?s debt rallied on Friday after the company settled claims by New York over its opioid marketing, averting a possible $1 billion verdict and the risk it could have been stripped of its legal defenses in an ongoing trial in the state.The pact, announced late Thursday, settles for $50 million allegations that the opioid maker?s sales and marketing efforts helped fuel a public crisis over the highly addictive painkillers. Lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James and two Long Island counties had accused Endo of adopting illegal tactics to turn its Opana painkiller into a blockbuster.Endo?s bonds were among the biggest gainers in the high-yield market on Friday. Its 6% notes due 2028 climbed as much #$%$25 cents on the dollar to 69.5 cents, and its 9.5% bonds due 2027 rallied 2.875 cents to 100.125.The company?s stock also surged, rising as much as 58.6% to $3.33, its biggest gain on record.Endo?s decision to settle leaves four defendants in the New York trial, in which jurors may now have to weigh whether to award more than $1 billion in damages each against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., one of its subsidiaries, ANDA Inc. and a unit of Allergan Ltd. ?Sounds like the Endo folks made a smart move in settling this case,? said Richard Ausness, a University of Kentucky law professor who follows the opioid litigation. ?While $50 million is a lot of money to a smaller company like Endo, they were facing more than $1 billion in exposure.?"
"I believe a global settlement is coming but perhaps part of Endo’s strategy is to directly fight the toughest jurisdictions where both the DA, population and Par’s and Endo’s distribution are the most in favor of plaintiffs eventually settling. Then once the big risk are settled for much less than originally modeled they negotiate with all the small less affected jurisdictions where opioids were less of an issue and Endo’s products were minimally prescribed! This seems to be the trend! This, if accurate, explains their actions to date and hiring that restructuring firm could play into this strategy. So, that leaves about 10 more individual trials if I am taking stock correctly. Anybody know all the settling jurisdictions?"
"Fidelity's equity score for ENDP is now 7.1, down from 8.1."
Looks like a massive short squeeze is under way.float it is only about 35 million shares
"The risk/reward is quite high. When all is clear, stock should go to $10 easy. Then, start heading to $20. Nobody wants bankruptcy. At least, the states are receiving some compensation for damages."
"Chantix produces $1 billion in annual gross sales with margins north of 70%. Typically, when a single generic competitor enters the market the margins drop to about 50%, gross sales fall about 25%-30% and the innovating company maintains about 60-70% of those gross sales - usually closer ti 60%. So splitting the difference at 65% we can model Endo’s 1 year gross income to be 35% of 75% of $1 billion which comes out to ~ $265 million or $130-$160 million net depending on internal margins (remember no need to maintain a sales team). This should replace most of the vasostrict EBITDA when and if that comes to pass but for the next 12 months it will be ok top of it. Nice addition."
"oh look- the Ignorant tim is here again to make fun of the fact that I made money on two DDOG trades--while he was short, lol! lol!! However NOTHING compares to his epic failure of shorting GME at $4 while Burry and the insiders were buying! He thought he knew better and said ""I guarantee you that I know more about retail than Burry"".He is so delusional that he cannot see that it is happening again here in ENDP. No matter, he's broke and positionless anyway. He's just here to try and get me back, lol! Even when ENDP hits $10 he still wins because public humiliation arouses our board bottom!"
"Notice how the Ignorant tim, Ericinpdx, and fake syd are all missing today-- after being here all at the same time all last week? Coincidence? Not a chance! Our board bottom must be unavailable for trolling today. Or is it because ENDP is making him have flashbacks to when GME was $4?"
How is it possible for a 4:01P trade with a volume of 3MM quietly only move the SP one penny? Answer that and you'll feel either better or sick about your investment or heavy bag.

"Some advice to the ignorant richie-tim. Perhaps if you go back to 2nd grade, pass this time and come out with some applicable communication skills you could ask Mike, Burry and Gill (nicely) if you could visit your money? Maybe doing so will help alleviate some of your psychosis and, perhaps then, you will have some time in your day to find a suitable job for your skill-set - instead of cyberstalking all of us who took your money, that is. A job like a janitor or bussing McDonald's tables? Unfortunately, they likely won't give your money back to you but let's be honest...1. you'll just lose it again anyway, like a true cucky you enjoy watching them with it! haha"
now that that's out of the way.....as if there was any doubt the games played this morning....can anyone explain why JnJ paid $5B for 8% share and Purdue paid less for 60% share? that puts Endo at $1.5-$3B when it should just be $1.5B
"In a bk a company continues to operate, management retains their jobs, all employees maintain their jobs, and the companies continues producing. Only changes: debt gets converted into new shares for the debt holders, and current crop of wimpy pansy shareholders get either massively diluted or cancelled.

Any latest news from Judge Wilson?

Somethings up... news news
"@ scott I have a couple of questions for you on your MNK experience. Any thoughts would be appreciated. 1- You mentioned that you felt like Latham had their own agenda (making more fees I guess) Could you elaborate on that a little bit?2- With MNK announcing their global deal, the stock didn’t do much although it was just before the pandemic collapsed everything so hard to read but starting from Jan 15 the stock went up significantly. (Endo was going higher too) was that a leak of info you think? They were working with bunch of bond people so not surprising it went out i guess. Hard to know what endo is working on the debt side (could be much lighter touch considering the bond maturities) expecting some kind of info spreading around in advance wouldn’t be unreasonable i guess?3- MNK didn’t have to include opioids settlement in the rsa but they did. I guess they did that to gain the Judges approval even for the personal enrichment part as well. Since opioid abatement is funded Judge would be looking somewhere else on some not very fair stuff. Make sense? Endo doesn’t have to incorporate anything i suppose. Thanks man. Hope it was not too long."
Global settlement next week?
"@hnstinvt Equity markets are indeed open on Columbus Day (the bond markets are closed). As for any news being released tomorrow, anything's possible; who knows."
"Based on the premarket activity, looks like a good day for ENDP today."
Just an FYI. I did get some time to listen in on Ca. Trial today and closing arguments of all defendants are quite compelling.
"I’ve noticed that since I correctly identified Scott’s malady today he’s been totally silent.

If you don’t want to end up in the “memory care” wing of your local nursing home, you NEED to seek treatment and STOP. Let’s make a deal.

"“In January 2021, a short squeeze of the stock of the American video game retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME)…causing major financial consequences… large losses for short sellers” -Wikipedialarge losses - that’s our little downy friend peg-boy or ignorant Richie-Tim - it’s him they are indirectly referencing “short sellers”.Imagine piling into the most overcrowded short trade in history and then shorting at its LOW! You could script greater stupidity and then to live on in infamy in publications like Wikipedia - sad! I remember the next to final scene in Trading Places where Duke’s trader is overwhelmed and drained out as he tries to by back his OJ to cover his short - that is the ignorant Richie-tim must’ve looked like!"
You see the booster shot news? First the news was “FDA panel rejects boosters for the general public!”Then the real story came out that said FDA approves boosters for 65+.This is exactly how media and shorts get your shares
"Clarissa, report in! "
"I hate to assume, but I'm assuming Wilson will announce ruling by end of this month?"
"Still don't understand why it's so difficult to settle NY, when TN was considered extraordinary for rare default judgement of $2 4 Billion. Why call in restructuring advisors. It seems they settled TN without outside help, unless they were hired a few months ago."
$20 in 6 months
"Global settlement coming. Shorts will have to Cover today. Sell your shares with 20 USD limit, so they can't buy cheap"
Drug companies say enough U.S. states join $26 billion opioid settlement to proceed
Why would Endo bother paying 35M to TN just to BK a month later? Makes no sense
I bet we hear about Ca. Within the next 2 weeks which could be a turning point.
Higher highs and higher lows...higher volume ta boot.
Global settlement seems like it's taking forever.

Then pulled Pfizer completely out of the market. 1billion dollar check handed to Endo, guys go and cash it!!"
"at the very end Wilson mentioned endo and monday deadline get back to us , i couldn't quite hear or make out what it pertains to but it was to endo , not the rest................ could it be they already have something going ?if anyone heard that please share it ."
Three times record volume and 0.69 cents — six times average volume today and red….A much stronger reaction to NY than TN and really no reaction to the MDL being paused….. what’s the deal? Smart money still expects a negative restructuring?
"Perspective. A lot of conjecture and hyperbole being thrown around and A LOT of it involves superficial comparisons between Endo and MNK which, some, including myself have stated are dubious at best. Anyway, in addition to the normal tools availble to investors there are some ""social"" tools that one, if cleaver enough, can find information about the current situation from the inside. I've contended that a core tenant to MNK's BK was their abysmal and self interested management team, who, under the guidance of some self interested shysters decided they could solve years of product mismanagement while enriching themselves. Endo's management, on the other hand, was handpicked by TPG - one of their largest investors - and it should be obvious to anyone with a brain the dramatic difference and contrast these guys present compared to the imbeciles over at MNK. Anyway, let's take some employee perspectives shall we?MNKBelow is some commentary, just prior to MNK's announcement last October. *****************Former Employee, more than 10 years""Going bankrupt for good reasons""Sep 2, 2020 - R&D Scientist in Saint Louis, MORecommend""..Poorly managed and no appreciation for employees""Another employee""CEO and most executive committee and BOD members are greedy and not focused on patients or employees.

"The plaintiffs in the foregoing cases asserted various claims relating to the defendants' marketing and sale of prescription opioid medications and/or alleged failures to take adequate steps to identify and report suspicious orders. A jury trial on liability has been ongoing since June 2021.As a result of the settlement, Endo's subsidiaries have been severed from the trial. The settlement fully and finally resolves all of the asserted claims in exchange for a total payment of $50 million. The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing, fault or liability of any kind by Endo or its subsidiaries, and the settlement value should not be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases or claims."
"I’d rather have the global deal announce a channeling injunction through Par then to have a deal, watch the stock pop, then have the restructuring firm announce Chapter after the fact.

why isn't AH absorbing the CA closing arguments news? It is positive for the defendants.
Rich- the states DON'T WANT a state by state settlement....it will take years for that to occur...its in the best interest of all parties to get to a global settlement...the exact timing of that is the question as is the final payout...but neither endp or the states want to go state by state
"I don’t understand the people who say Endo is sub $1B. Smaller role than Teva smaller role than anyone, last on market first to come off blah blah. They’re kidding themselves. Endo marketed a brand as that’s where the punishment is. It doesn’t matter that Teva sold 98% in NY - they’re coming after the brands."
New lawsuit over on ST. Yahoo not letting it post. But read what the law firm is saying about Endo. They’re done. 100% bankrupt.
@ Max whats your Position doing?
"Endo should make a generous settlement in form of free stuff like Teva. They could offer free Vasostrict for 3b or something, see how Eagle competes with that :D"
Volume is insanely high. This might have attracted the attention of a few in the Reddit crowd… we will find out.
"it's so great that now the only hope is that CA shoots Endo to 4. it used to be 6. it used to be 10. folks accepting less and less because they have seen that TN, NY, LA have had zero impact on the share price meaningfully. imagine a 401k holder at Endo. negative sum game because market is not random. if random it would be a zero sum game with some profit and loss here and there the way captialistic markets should be."
I’m hoping chx is much more than what’s needed to offset Vaso ( if CRL resolved and appeal lost )….otherwise shorts will do what they do again. Could just be a zero sum game given unfortunate ruling in favor of Eagle

Is closing at the high a good sign?
Tutes Richie? lol
For those who don’t know MNK had their global amount raised from $1.6B to $1.725B not because the ~40+ states wanted more it is because all 50 states have signed on. So we can expect some reason from the remaining high death/100k lives states. Possible to get them all

"off the press....Three major opioid distributors, sued over their role in the opioid crisis, have signed off on a massive settlement deal with the state, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said Thursday.“This is a historic day for Ohio,” he said. “Ohio’s place is now secure.”A larger deal involving other states and parties is still up in the air, so “we negotiated a separate Ohio deal for our trial, because it was imminent,”"
…. Court out for the day?
Dopesick.Really hate Yahoo since they deleted the article link about the new Hulu series that airs next week. It stars Michael Keaton as a small town Dr. being besieged by Purdue reps pushing oxy. I don't think there is much wash over effect on ENDO. I just wish they would cover the Fentanyl angle.FL
"Listened to Q2 cc just now. They have 1.5 billion in cash at 6/30/21. And, business will continue to generate plenty of cash through diverse product line. TN, NY and hopefully CA will be resolved soon. I just don't see bankruptcy. Again, risk/reward is quite good."
Jt: Just bought 3000 more shares. This opioid catastrophe is coming to a close and I'm loading up under $4.00 a share.
great news from teva. great for endo
"Should I find it flattering or scary that our board bottom, aka ignorant peg-boy Tim, is obsessed with me? He seems to respond to my every post and virtually all his activity on these boards is dedicated to his worship of me….Is it because, unlike him, I make money on my trades? Is it because, unlike him, I satisfy his wife? Is it because, unlike him, I have 46 chromosomes to his 47? Any help is appreciated, thanks!"
"Poor Richietim....he didn't learn his lesson when predicting BK for Gamestop last year. Every day there were posts comparing GME to Blockbuster video, despite drastically different balance sheets, cash flow, and valuations. He was so sure he shorted 2 lots of GME at $4, saying ""I guarantee you that I know more about retail than Burry. GME will never see $10 again, ever"". Now chumped and broke, Richietim spends each day playing pretend while seeking revenge against his many, many owners, lol!"
It appears on its way to $10
"This will be algo shorted on the daily until the next bad news item —all the way up to BK, if they BK.You’ve seen it yourself. Chantix, settlements these things have no long term effects on SP."
I’m new here.Does anyone know how much revenues QWO brought in last Q?Thanks
"Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer for Nassau County, said he was “happy our clients can get closure and it has kept Endo out of bankruptcy, that would have hurt everyone.”Very promising for global deal…"
"Here is my thought for the Chantix: 1). 1st to enter generics has 180 days exclusivity, meaning no other generics can enter this space during this 180 days. Especially now the reference drug is all pulled out. So ~$1 billion established market with no other players!!! For Endo now, it’s just order the replacement for Chantix for at least 180 days!!! 2). Often this type of impurity issues are serious deal to FDA. It means Pfizer will at least spend 1 or 2 year to statist FDA before they can re-enter. 3) that will pump up Endo earning a lot just because of this one drug!!! Guys, go buy buy buy now!!!!"
bull flag on top of bull flag...chart looks GREAT!
"Gee shorts--the market is down 1.5% today , yet ENDP is up again. There are thousands of overvalued stocks out there that would make better shorts-- yet here you are, still believing that BK is in the cards.Its very reminiscent of what happened 1 year ago on the GME board. You'll learn the hard way, but hopefully you will learn. That is unless you are someone who cries out for 'trousers""--he never learns, lol."
"Loving this upward climb, soon volumes will increase to lift ENDP to $10 or more."
"keep in mind this thing was $18 in 2018. 3 years INTO the opioid decline on Share prices overall and equal amount of uncertainty if not more because nothing was resolved at that time. now even with the current progress, the market prices Endo's chances as 6 times worse than they were in 2018. for those who listen to the SP."
"How much of the recent movement in ENDO SP is attributed to the string of news pieces that opioid deaths are way up and the interviews with the users on the street indicate that cheap fentanyl is readily available and the source of the problem. The NBC news piece indicated that they could score a days supply for two people for $5. The AG's have done a lot of scapegoating but what has the government done to stop the supply of Chinese Fentanyl from flooding into this country? How many of these addictions even began with legal prescribed opioids?This Opioid crisis has next to nothing to do with Opana, the drug has been been off the market for 4 years yet the number of users and deaths has increased every year. FL"

What exactly is undervalued here? A company sinking in debt or the massive lawsuits?"
6.66$ @ Halloween
Why are people on ST saying CA trial isn’t til next year and doesn’t involve Endo? Not true unless I’ve been under a rock yea?
how can this company survive with so much debt and so many court cases pending?
Looks endo choose to pay full amount right away not over a period
Bought 2000 more shares based solely on hope that a Universal settlement is in the works.
"The potential debt from a global settlement under 1.5 billion has already been factored in, secondly ENDO is flush with cash with new products being introduced. I'd say BK is under 5% probability."
"I?m a private markets investor for work and dabble in public markets for fun, so I?m not really up on the day trader jargon. #$%$ is a ?tute??"
"This stock can drive a person to drink. Two weeks ago I never thought I would say this, but I am back in ( with about 1/2 of my prior position with an average cost basis of $2.90. The Chantix news and my demented ego being the main reasons. This company is so undervalued."
Jt: Does ENDO have the production rights for Novavax in the United States?
Scott’s right the opioid payments aren’t debt as they are not interest bearing ( Clarissa is wrong ) but in the branded opioid segment Endo had 20% market share only behind 60% for Purdue. Now Purdue’s expected penalty range was 3-30B and they got 4.5B. This means Endo should pay $1.5B total. Not $3B. Not sure why this can’t get done. But 8.3B interest bearing on top of $1.5B non interest bearing on top of losing that partial exclusivity of Vasostrict which could have gone uncontested til 2035 and its puts this company on the fence line of BK. I mean a $10B penalty would have given them a staggering 14x debt leverage.
"With recent $26B settlement, premarket seems to be seeking positive territory. Unusually high volume for premarket."
I really sense the end of opioid lawsuits are coming to a close.
"It now appears that besides being uneducated on income statements, RichietimClarissa hasn't learned 'her' lesson about the perils of shorting into a crowded trade. Even funnier, 'she's' oblivious to risk/reward.But thats why 'she' is a bona fide profit giver!"
"Now playing the role of amateur pitchfork: ""Hooch"".""Clarissa"" failed. What else can Richietim do?"
Still no news?!?! But the stocks keeps climbing up!!!!!! Something we donot know yet…….
"So for arguments sake let's say there is a global settlement and the Endo/Eagle fight is over with both having a share of the market. Share price returns to $10, why would Endo be a good/bad investment if your time horizon is 5 years? Is there any value in anything beyond Xiaflex?"
anyone know why this is up so much in a week?
"""Owie, Rissy...Timmy's bottom is owie...Mike and GME made Timmy's other bottom owie too!'"
I've been watching this one and slowly adding since the $4 range - Added another nice chunk yesterday. I'll hold this for YEARS!!!
"It would seem only logical that ENDP would negotiate an affordable global settlement, if MNK negotiated one. Speculation that ENDP would be willing to file chapter 11, in spite of a settlement may be entirely premature or completely erroneous. Once a settlement is achieved, what would be the purpose of filing chapter 11?"
"Beautiful, just absolutely beautiful. Go ENDP!!!"
"when's the last time anyone said why is this up 10% on no news? yeah, i couldn't remember either."
"Funny to see some commentary here about ""shorts in control"" when the stock isn't heavily shorted (10% of float), it's down less than 1% on the day, and volume isn't particularly high. What we DO know is that everyone is waiting on CA first and what forward looking comments we get during earnings around Qwo, Chantix, and Vaso.Overall revenues have been stable, and if Qwo / Chantix can offset the unknowns on Vaso going forward this will steadily climb even without a global settlement."
…..Trial over. Judge just indicated “I’ll be in touch.”
squeeze is over. shorty bosses back in control. same as MNK. only $2 squeeze allowed then tutes take over and algo sell your gains. take heed.
Endo manufactures for $NVAX and Novavax just submitted for WHO approval of emergency use of Covid 19 protein based vax.

It’s amazing what Yahoo deletes. Don’t want certain facts out. 43.5MM shares shorted that Friday. Short shares being lent at 50BP…. should be 30 times that. Only a P-scheme between investment houses could have allowed it. SI is now over 300%. More than GME and AMC combined. Stock should have been 15. You do the math on why it’s so vital for them to keep this down. Can anyone say “next Melvin Capital”?
"The question is, will we have a similar TN type bounce in SP tomorrow?"
"The algorithms will churn this on a daily basis making MILLIONS for tutes and MMs, but the undeniable direction for ENDP is going to be up. Long term gold!"

Favorable settlement with CA next week. Global settlement the week after…
".....what is the reason for the sudden jump this morning? Is CA judge going to finally call it ""winner winner chicken dinner"" for the defendants ?"
The interesting thing here is that the global deal has the 12/31 clock for the AGs but we’ll know by 3Q earnings if they’ve been buying back their stock and if they hired restructuring…. so it will have its binary reaction then not end of year
TEVA is clawing back too

"Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have settled three consolidated cases pending with the State of New York over opioid addiction and overdose crisis.As a result of the settlement, Endo's subsidiaries have been severed from the trial.The final settlement resolves all of the asserted claims in exchange for a total payment of $50M and includes no admission of wrongdoing, fault or liability of any kind by Endo or its subsidiaries, and the settlement value should not be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases or claims.The plaintiffs asserted various claims relating to improper marketing and sale of opioids, downplaying the addiction risks, and that big shipments were not flagged as suspicious.A jury trial on liability has been ongoing since June 2021. Johnson & Johnson settled just before the trial began, and AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson - have all since settled.Last week, U.S. bankruptcy judge approved bankruptcy plan for OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, that resolves thousands of lawsuits alleging the company fueled the opioid crisis.SEEKING ALPHA"

"Often I am complaining here about Endo Mgmt., but I have to admit that 7.5m is a great deal. The other good thing is that with every case they settle, they set a precedence for other cases that are still up to come."
"Hey guys, with everything going on today, something huge happening soon! Let’s Gama squeeze this baby to 30’s, where it really belongs."
"Question of the day:If the Ignorant tim and EricinPDX have no ENDP position, why are ""they"" here?"
"The fact that NY settled for only $50M just 3 weeks after the unconfirmed report about A&M being brought on for a possible restructuring, says that news leak did precisely what was intended - if in fact that's what ENDP was going for, to expedite settlements. If that was their intention (and there's every reason to believe it was), then mgmt played their hand really well. CA is up next - and that should also end in a favorable settlement, and if it does then a global settlement across the board is practically assured. (I think it's assured as of the NY settlement but we'll see.)"
"Look at the biggest sucker of all-- who sold his virtual ENDP shares at $2.10--babbling about 'tutes', lol!!Hey Richietim--have you EVER been right?"
"this is from 2021 10Q ( 2nd quarter) and initiated Nov. 2020 , well before the WSJ article about A&M hire , iv'e mentioned many times restructuring does not always apply to BK so it's possible it has something to do with this , remember , this is a turnaround story as they have stated focusing on more profitable branded specialty which makes good sense considering the downward pricing pressure on generics . 2020 Restructuring InitiativeOn November 5, 2020, the Company announced the initiation of several strategic actions to further optimize the Company’s operations and increase overall efficiency (the 2020 Restructuring Initiative). These actions are expected to generate significant cost savings that will be reinvested, among other things, to support the Company’s key strategic priority to expand and enhance its product portfolio. These actions include the following:•Optimizing the Company’s retail generics business cost structure by exiting manufacturing sites in Irvine, California and Chestnut Ridge, New York, as well as active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing and bioequivalence study sites in India. The sites will be exited in a phased approach that is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. Certain products currently manufactured at the Irvine and Chestnut Ridge sites are expected to be transferred to other internal and external sites within the Company’s manufacturing network.•Improving operating flexibility and reducing general and administrative costs by transferring certain transaction processing activities to third-party global business process service providers.•Increasing organizational effectiveness by further integrating the Company’s commercial, operations and research and development functions, respectively, to support the Company’s key strategic priorities.As a result of the 2020 Restructuring Initiative, the Company’s global workforce is expected to be reduced by approximately 525 net full-time positions. The Company expects to realize annualized pre-tax cash savings (without giving effect to the costs described below) of approximately $85 million to $95 million by the first half of 2023, primarily related to reductions in Cost of revenues of approximately $65 million to $70 million and other expenses, including Selling, general and administrative and Research and development expenses, of approximately $20 million to $25 million."
"2021 sales are projected at 2.8 billion. So, the company has solid sales and earnings. Risk/reward seems advantageous. I can't imagine any big surprises to the downside after New York settlement. Surprised stock didn't stay above $3 today."
These buying opportunities will soon be gone
My guess is global settlement won't be more than $720 millions if they pay it on the settlement date. if they stretch it over 10 years then it could be about $1.3 billion. They can afford that easily.

"My one piece of advice for any legitimate long on this board is to ignore whatever Rich says unless it’s to mock him. His self interested conjecture should be obvious to most. He’s trying to convince himself he made the ‘right’ choice but can’t string together a single logical and rationale argument to validate any of his positions. He mostly just bounces from contrived moronic theory to contrived moronic theory hoping something (eventually) makes sense and perhaps sticks. I will guarantee you that Rich, again, will be on the wrong side of this trade. This last post about Teva and Endo had me shaking my head so hard I might have whiplash!"
Where is Rich’s daily installment of babble?
So much debt. Will end up like mnk. Lololololol
"nice for Endo. Par launches the only generic. But Pfizer is also recalling its branded product. So par is alone. Assuming par can operationally supply the entire market, it can price at 80-85% of the Pfizer price. As the only generic company, why price any lower. So model out 100% of the generic market, at 80% price. And Par will have this monopoly until the next generic company will come in."
"If this stock had the equivalent price to sales ratio of Snowflake, it would be over $1,000/ share. Once Wall Streets’ fetish for EV and SAAS fades and transitions to Biotech, ENDP will move to $80 or more per share."

I'm not sure why anyone on this board still believes bankruptcy is in the cards. TN & NY have set the table for a global settlement. California has been soft on Endo and Attorney Generals are weary of long drawn out cases. As far as I'm concerned its over. The settlement will be less than 1.5 billion and Endo moves on.
"Amazing how there are so many ponzies worth $billions in the market these days worth absolutely nothing and providing absolutely no product - and here you have endo with life saving products, making tons of money and valued at less than $500M. This entire world is upside down."
"I think that ENDP settles prior to Thanksgiving. New York State folded like one of Rich's suits (the cheap polyester kind). Also, note that the New York settlement implies a nationwide settlement of $2.1B, while the Tennessee settlement implied a a nationwide settlement of $3.9B. The States are losing traction. New York is the second most powerful state in the Country, and they completely capitulated. Why?ENDP has spoken to most bondholders, so they have a restructuring plan, waterfall analysis and Plan of Reorganization prepared. They could file on January 1st, barring a market meltdown, and keep the equityholders ""whole"". I do NOT think that they will file, but I do believe that they gave the Attorney Generals a deadline. I also believe that there is already an offer on the table, but ENDP would like to wait for California to rule. If the States offer $2.3B, and favorable payment terms, then ENDP will accept it. [Equity trades over the counter after a filing, but current shareholders retain their participation until after the Judge rules. If the Judge ""keeps us whole"", we emerge from BK at $10 per share. Study the Hertz filing. It is a direct comparable. MNKK is not, but Rich is too stupid to comprehend that.]The States know that they will receive less than $1.5B if ENDP files. Also, Rich lied about the market share. It was another one of his ""whoppers"". Am not going through the math again, but Google: ----> ""Massachusetts, Attorney General, Opioids and ENDO"". The Massachusetts' Attorney General provides the best market share numbers for all opioids manufacturers, which imply a $900M settlement on the basis of Purdue and $1.2B on the basis of MNKK. Rich will say that he knows better than an AG, but we all know that Rich is an idiot.The bonds never trade. A bond trade involves at least $100,000 of purchases and ENDP's bonds are trading (maybe) 10-times per day. Why are bondholders refusing to sell? The bonds trading at 66 are providing investors with 20% yields in a 10-year treasury market of 1.52%. Everyone is dumping bonds after Evergrande , but no one is willing to sell ENDP.

"ENDO is a swing traders dream. The playbooks are completely exposed. The plaintiffs sue for billions claiming ENDO pushed opioids and skirted discovery rules. Most do not want to litigate in court after watching how poorly Cal trial was progressing. ENDO calls bluff indicating that if the settlement is not rationale/acceptable they will restructure and/or BK and any settlement will be tied up in court for years. Meanwhile, investor confidence swings the gamut. How many times can this play out before global settlement? The Opioid epidemic had so many enablers that trials are going to be rare. In the meantime it is all posturing for settlement.FL"
"My theory is this and I think it makes a lot of sense. When Endo bought Par (same as Teva buying Activis ) it fit their portfolio the way a rare diseases company like Shire buys other rare disease companies ( Baxalta , NPS etc ). It’s better to join em then try to beat them. But when these generic purchases happened the market as well as FDA contributes to generic pricing and competition making these among the worst hind sight purchases ( with Tevas being the worst M&A debacle in history ). Fast forward to opioid litigation. I believe these companies will use opioids as a way out of essentially never being able to pay back the price tag still owed on the generic buys. Buying BTSC for example strengthens the asset side for sale or divesting but I believe that overall, using this theory, Endo has no goal of saving the overall company. Mark this post. It’s too perfect. Eliminate the albatross."

"Opioid problem has nothing to do with supply of drugs, it's all to do with human behaviors and human's issues facing life itself. It's the addicts that contribute to overdoes and abusive behaviors. It's a family related problem. A social issue dealing with high cost of living. working 9 to 5 and commuting long hours, addicted to alcohol and or from abusive parents or partners. Everything to do with the addicts and being a weaker human being. Strong humans do not easily be trapped by drug use. This has to do with rule of nature. The strong survive and the weak suffer. Law of nature rules over humans and their society. It's one cannot adapt, one would perish from the face of this earth. Darwin's natural selection of species continue to be true for as long as life remains anywhere."

"First of all, let me say I am happy for all my ENDO friends. I certainly am thinking about getting back in, but ( for me ) want more clarity and a higher level of confidence BK is off the table. It seems like there were similar bounces with MNK and there are a slew of these cases left. Best to all."

"Is there a backdoor agreement with Pfizer on the launch of Chantix? This FiercePharma article from last year suggests that Pfizer missed filing deadlines and did not strenuously try to enforce patents that expired in 2022. In short they did not take the actions necessary to block the generic competition. Perhaps they knew of the carcinogen issue and struck a deal with the generic.FLChantixCompany: Pfizer Use: smoking cessation 2019 U.S. sales: $899 million Main patent expiration: November 2020 Pfizer has dealt with some costly patent expirations in recent years for Viagra and Lyrica, and the company expects the erosion to continue this year. It's projecting a $2.4 billion hit to 2020 sales from generics and biosimilars.Chantix, which is used to help smokers quit, may well contribute to those losses by year's end. It’ll lose its main patent in November, but other patents stretch to 2022, so it remains to be seen exactly when generics will launch. The drug generated $899 million in the U.S. in 2019.Par Pharmaceutical acquired a generic from Actavis and later sued Pfizer seeking a declaration from the court that its generic version wouldn’t infringe Pfizer’s 2022 patents, court records show. Par didn’t challenge the November 2020 patent. In its lawsuit, Par said Pfizer didn’t respond within a 45-day deadline to assert its patent claims after Actavis applied for approval to market the generic. Par later withdrew its suit, and court filings didn’t say what had happened. Endo, which owns Par, didn't respond to a request for comment.A Pfizer spokesman said the company ""does not speculate if or when a generic company will launch a generic version of Chantix.""Chantix won original U.S. approval in 2006, and as the drug nears the end of its exclusivity, its price has grown significantly. In 2018, GoodRx reported that Chantix’s price had doubled over the last 5 years. RELATED: Price of Pfizer's smoking-cessation drug Chantix doubles in just 5 years: report Whenever Chantix loses exclusivity, it’s set to follow other declines by other big Pfizer brands such as Viagra and Lyrica. Still, the company believes it's nearing an end to its recent streak of patent expirations. Overall, Pfizer said in an annual filing it expects the “impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries will be significant in 2020, then moderating downward to a much lower level from 2021 through 2025.""Book traversal links for 3.

He has since made the same call on ENDP, shorting ENDP at $3 and is on the verge of losing what few pennies he has left. However, when that happens in the coming weeks will the ignorant Tim do it again? Do we, as competent, 46 chromosome (he has 47) humans, have an obligation to keep the ignorant one from doing it once again?"
Endo is so volatile now while Teva just stays steady. And they are embroiled in the same trials. Read that tea leaf.
"(Reuters) -A California judge on Thursday said several large counties accusing four drugmakers of fueling an opioid epidemic had presented a ""dearth of evidence"" during a multi-billion dollar trial to support finding the companies' pain pill marketing caused the health crisis.Judge Peter Wilson sharply questioned the counties' lawyer during closing arguments about what evidence would support finding Johnson & Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Endo International PLC and AbbVie Inc's Allergan unit liable for the epidemic.Fidelma Fitzpatrick, a lawyer for the populous Santa Clara, Los Angeles and Orange counties and the city of Oakland, argued the drugmakers' marketing downplayed opioids' addictive risks and promoted them for broader uses than intended.That advertising led to billions of pain pills flooding their communities over 20 years and an ongoing rise in opioid overdose deaths, Fitzpatrick said in her closing argument.""Those promotional activities worked,"" she said.But Wilson, the Orange County Superior Court judge presiding over the non-jury trial, said the plaintiffs lacked evidence showing the marketing caused doctors to write inappropriate, rather than appropriate, prescriptions.Wilson said policymakers seemed to have known an increase in prescriptions of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved opioids could result in ""regrettable"" abuse yet accepted that as a trade-off to ensure pain was treated.""It's the dearth of evidence by a single doctor, a single patient, a single person to say 'I changed my practices because...,' or 'I did something different because...,'"" he said. ""That's the inference I'm being asked to draw.""Michael Yoder, J&J's lawyer, agreed, saying the plaintiffs ""can't start with an abstract problem and work backwards to determine if there's an actionable public nuisance."""
"Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer for Nassau County, said he was ""happy our clients can get closure and it has kept Endo out of bankruptcy, that would have hurt everyone."""
"See the Four, be the $4."
Good day
"This stock has a humble price target of $7 from most analysts, you could easily 3x your money in the near term. Not to mention, unlike most biotechs this ENDP actually has earnings and 3 billion in annual revenue. Once the greedy short selling class action hungry lawyers lose their cases, this stock will reach a new ATH."
Buy...Buy...Buy... I was right the last time...when I mentioned settlement with NY... Please refer to my previous posting. :-)
Where is our friend Clarissa TS? She must be too busy with her cats
"we can speculate here till were blue in the face about comparing one state to another in trying to put a price on a settlement ...... what really matters is location / judge / ag's ............ here's a good read from yesterday about distributors ........ : title : Drug distributors fought to keep a scathing report out of West Virginia’s landmark opioid trial. A judge sided with them.It was an important piece of evidence — a 324-page congressional report that slammed the nation’s largest prescription drug distributors for their role in fueling the opioid crisis. But a federal judge blocked the scathing report from being presented during a seven-week trial that pitted Cabell County and the City of Huntington against drug wholesalers McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen.The December 2018 report was part of an 18-month bipartisan investigation into pill dumping in West Virginia. A U.S. House committee cited the “Big Three” distributors for systemic “failures that contributed to the worsening opioid epidemic” by delivering an “inordinate” number of prescription painkillers to the stateDuring the recent trial, U.S. District Judge David Faber sided with the companies’ attorneys who argued that the congressional report — issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — was “inherently political.” The decision contradicted a previous ruling by a federal judge in Cleveland who’s presiding over thousands of lawsuits against the pharmaceutical distributors.Faber is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether the drug distributors should be held accountable and pay for their alleged misconduct. The non-jury trial started in May and ended in July.Faber’s ruling to bar the congressional report from the trial was a significant blow to the plaintiffs’ lawyers. They couldn’t question witnesses about it. They couldn’t present the report’s findings or the more than 900 pages of supporting documents.the article goes on , if you want the rest google the title , for some reason youho wont let me post a link ."
"As I’ve discussed… “you seldom hire if not days looking through someone”Has anyone found “the MNK case hair”? I bet it’s real harry, eh? Lol a 40 word run on sentence followed immediately by a 42 word sentence!!!! Lol can’t wait for him to break the 50 word barrier! Lol now EVERY post is about me! Hey Eric and rich and Clarissa…. What’s the insides of his head look like from your point of view!Bhwahahahahahahaha"
$10 coming but by $2022 we might see $20 levels. $100 within the next 5 to 7 years is possible.
"oh well, it will be shorted into good news. again. until it's BK as preferred by CSuite and BOD....shorts know.they need to get out from huge $8B albatross debt from buying Par"
When is the CA court beck in session?
"DUFF, your original prediction of a global settlement by Thanksgiving may very well be on target. Do you still feel confident about the same time frame? I feel after TN & NY, and CA looking exceptionally good, ENDP is finally turning a corner in opiod litigation. It seems almost too good to be true..."
"I see Peggy-boy is on here early this morning trying posting his usual fragmented drivel! I guess a complete and rationale thought is nowhere to be found in that psychosis filled head of his! Haha he was wrong about GME and ENDP among many, many others!"
So is ENDP out of the woods now? Global settlement more likely based on TN & NY?
"But...""Clarissa""....Why pretend to go long now since bankruptcy is inevitable??Oh... thats right....ENDP bottomed out last week.Well at least your virtual shares were bought today with ENDP up just 10% vs Richie buying shares the next day after the fact... after a 25% move higher, lol!!"
"somebody said, let it go... and it did. I'll take it, but what a wierd #$%$ market."
"All my recent buys such as baba, bidu, IQ, Open, even QS started to make uptrend. Hope to see Endo back up to $10 level and get settlement done. My advice for everyone is take a look at Tlry and cgc. Both stock down from $60 levels and might have bottomed. Buy some now while price low and average down if drop lower but trend should be up as 50 States will legalize pot. Perhaps being legal around the world. Buy the biggest in the industry also to minimize risk. Always buy low sell much higher. That's key to successful future. No headaches if you buy the right time, good companies, buy during maximum fear. Good luck to all who follow my free advice. Buy Baba and Bidu should still be ok to have huge profits in the next few years."
I have a feeling that they announce global settlement tonight or on the weekend. And then 'boom ' off it goes...
"Short interest increased 25% last month, someone tell the Reddit ppl!"
Will ENDP generic pills avoid the carcinogen issue that Pzifer is struggling with?
"As ""Jedd"" on the GME message board I posted for 7 years with over 6000 posts .. Heck, I even invested in ENDP and posted here endlessly until the 500 shares that I bought in multiple traunches over $12 cratered to under $4. I never posted here again and decided to post endlessly about GME.Of course I went cold turkey 18 months ago after posting a lifetime gain over over $25K in game stop being long for 7 years! I like it thought that mike and scott like to reminisce about me. It makes perfect sense for me, with over 6000 posts to just stop posting and investing all together. Similar to scott posting about the GME message board with over 7000 posts, but never investing in GME or posting there!"
"Wow. Tbh. I thought endo was left for dead. But there’s a really good chance this companies going to come out of this opioid crisis. The govt’s/states are all settling cause they have no cash and the legal battles is costing too much govt money, which they don’t have. This actually might be the turning point."
"If you extrapolate from what JNJ and big3 paid in NY vs their nationwide settlements, endo’s global settlement bill could be between $1 and $1.1B. Heck i am fine with $1.5B. This is all i need to know for now…"
"Down a nickel, its CRASHING Rich. Tutes? Naked shorting?"
I made $25000 lifetime in GME. I like mike and scott ....I am a stable genius. Who cares if I own 5000 shares of ENDP over $12 and left this message board four years ago to only post on the GME message board?mike and scott are credible posters who would never think to ever post with multiple handles. They only post pertinent stock information and have scintillating conversations.
"A 50 million settlement…only 48 more to go Then the global..At this rate, Endo will owe over 3 billion"
"Opioids may conclude sooner than we thought. J&J partnered with ENDP in California. THIS may be why ENDP hired A&M.They submit the opioids legal liability to a Bankruptcy court and continue running the business as a going concern.

Are they not filing for bankruptcy as mentioned by Wallstreet report recently? Was that fake news?

I continue to stay sidelined because it should be obvious that the restructuring firm ruse was to get these settlements done in a payment manageable way but seeing the amounts in the face of default judgements should have confirmed that the cases aren’t that strong and they aren’t that interested in burying 10% or less market share companies in these states. But there’s no confidence in that. I think the choice is AGs go state by state with the egregious behavior offense and Endo is led to settle globally with a restructuring that only involves Ch11.
Has anyone noticed that the volume this past week has been extremely high (over and above the average)? Any thoughts?
"……and here we go again …. DOJ motion to block the deal:Earlier this month, a federal judge approved a bankruptcy settlement that granted immunity to the Sacklers as long as they paid $4.3 billion and renounced ownership of Purdue Pharma. The DOJ said the deal was ""unlawful"" and ""unconstitutional."""
I told you so. If we break 3.50 then we move. Next barrier 4.50. Will exceed 4 very quick. Will hold until 20
"""While litigation of the remaining opioid claims is ongoing, Endo is focused on its primary goal of achieving a global settlement. Endo is also currently exploring other strategic alternatives and may seek to implement one or more of those alternatives in the event it is unable to achieve a global settlement. Endo cannot speculate on the likelihood, nature or timing of any outcome."""
by the way Endo begun to ship Chantix
"Sept 30 (Reuters) - A California judge on Thursday said several large counties accusing four drugmakers of fueling an opioid epidemic had presented a ""dearth of evidence"" during a multi-billion dollar trial to support finding the companies' pain pill marketing caused the health crisis.Boom!"
So Rich…what exactly is your thesis here ???I see you mentioned Kare Schulz in one of your posts
"pfizer just announced (couple days ago actually) that they are now recalling all chantix. Who knows when they will be able to restart, talking a billion dollar open goal for endo"
