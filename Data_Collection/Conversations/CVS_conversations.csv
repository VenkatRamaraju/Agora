Why are CVS pharmacy counters chronically understaffed?
"It appears that CVS is facing a majority of ""downward"" adjustments per Yahoo"
"WHO HAS SPARCE SHELVES, A FRONT END CANDY STORE, EMPTY HEALTH FLUBS, MORE PEOPLE IN THE PHARMY DEPT THAN THE REST OF THE STORE, AND FLOOR STOCKERS WHO COULDN'T TELL YOU WHERE WHAT THEY ARE PUTTING ON THE SHELVES IS LOCATED. and then there's NO ONE AT THE REGISTER ABSENT PAVLOV'S BELLFINALLY, DID YOU EVER FIND THE SECOND ""BUY ONE AND GET ONE FREE, 40% OFFcvS/HIT is a dead company staggering. The greatest short opportunity since July 2015."
This stock has only the up  side and it’s safe investment it doesn’t drop very quickly at least you know when to get out
wish I got in earlier but I'm still loading.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

Are we in for a Monster earning report for CVS? Stores have seemed to be super busy by me. Coupled with the good Walgreens report of increase in retail and very nice health insurance results from UNH. Hopefully we follow suit in a few weeks!
"So wait! WAG goes up 10% on news that they want to be just like CVS! Oh yes, and they don’t have Aetna! CVS is so undervalued!"
"How I see CVS:Today: This should crack $89 if all the metrics add up as they should - and it SHOULD break $89....if not, this is in a weird spotBreaks $90.60 by Tuesday, HOLD (the only price point I would hold now)Earnings are dismal or misses expectations badly, SELLFalls below $80 for any reason in 2-3 months, SELL"
Looking Good !!!
"Anyone making any cash off CVS other than me ? What a fantastic company, in 3 years this stock will be minimum of 175 per share"
"Said 90 before earnings, going to be great earnings and hopefully good guidance takes this to 95, then triple digits!!"
"While it’s competitors hemorrhage cash, CVS continues to show why they are going to dominate this industry"
Positive action in WBA as well. Cvs dividend yesterday. Looking good into earnings
"Actually, pretty flat for last 30 days-mid 80s. Poised to move to next level-90s by earnings Craig knows he’ll never get it right!!"
Najarian fella mentioned cvs call activity on CNBC halftime show
They had some interesting insights about CVS on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"It is amazing that I have posted a half dozen times, that UnitedHealth Group was top recipient of questionable Medicare payments. It is clear someone doesn't want the information to get out."
Will earnings take the stock to $100 level next week?
Will be Green at the close
The safe stock to invest your portfolio today
bough 500 shares on dip
END OF YEAR PRICE TARGET? ANYONE? LENNY? CRAIG?
And there it is.....
"Move up going into earning-always a great sign. Strong in the last hour all week. Earnings will be amazing, hopefully guidance follows suit and 90+ follows with PT increases!!"

WSJ has an article on CVS 25 million ad spend
"Owned this stock for 4 years received a nice dividend thru out those years and I am currently up 43% since purchasing my shares not counting the dividend, looking forward to the next 4 years and hopefully this stock will continue to appreciate in value"
Y options keep going up?
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the CVS message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
"this is from 9/7 on CVS debt-working it down- CVS Health had US$59.4b of debt at June 2021, down from US$70.7b a year prior. However, it does have US$10.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$49.2b.Sep 7, 2021"
"CVS is clearly very undervalued at forward PE of 10.5 and dividend yield of 2.4%, while the overall market is near record high. CVS was 115 in 2015, but today, it's a much bigger company with Aetna and good prospects, it's selling at a deep discount. The market is not functioning efficiently."
90 going into earning...then the catapult needed to 120 over next 1-2 months...
I don’t understand someone buying at 86 then selling at $87.90 ???I don’t waste my time doing so I waiting for the big thing and guess what I’m not selling This is a dividend stock
"CVS needs to do better to compete with other pharmacies. I am a long term CVS holder and also a customer. Recent events changed my view on CVS. I went to fill my prescriptions on 30 days colchicine and allopurinol. CVS had no allopurinol and wanted to charge $399 on the colchicine. I went to Safeway and got both prescription filled for $39.20. CVS, please help the customer to save a buck or 2 by running the prescription through insurance and/or GoodRX - that is what Safeway did and they impressed me and got my account."
For the return you will have to be patient Every year it’s a big step toward paying Aetna debt and of course a dominant in the future
"Today, tomorrow and Monday have to show promise or there is little reason this would climb to $101-$114 as predicted by analysts. If you are not seeing a build up prior to earnings, then a good report - well, this will tumble back to $80 as sure as the moon comes out at night.Why invest in a stock with less than a 10% projected return. I am unsure how likely people are to get in at $95 knowing the upside is about 6%? Here, this is about the precipice of the high.Just think about it for 2 seconds. If analysts who are 33%-70% correct (not all that great to be honest) project a $101-114 stock price, that does not leave much for investors over $100. Now would be the time to get in, from $88-$92 imo.After that, the reward does not outweigh the risk of ownership and the stock is far too expensive to hover this long. Eventually a mass sell off will occur if this does not break $100 shortly."
"Who remembers ""Wheres the beef?"" Well, I think the real question to ask is Where is the MONEY? There are a lot of players chasing the Medicare dollar, but I really have to wonder about the release from CVS/Aetna a few days ago.....Here are some excerpts...All 2022 Aetna Medicare Eagle plans will feature a $0 monthly plan premium, $0 primary care copay (including walk-in clinics), dental, vision, hearing, over-the-counter allowance, SilverSneakers fitness program and $0 lab copay.The Aetna standalone prescription drug plans (PDP) serve 5.7 million members. In 2022, Aetna Medicare will offer the same three individual standalone PDPs as in 2021.SilverScript SmartRx (PDP), featuring an average monthly premium of $7.08, will again be the lowest premium plan available from Aetna. SilverScript Choice (PDP) will be under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) benchmark pricing in 49 states and D.C., while SilverScript Plus (PDP) has the most robust prescription drug coverage. All three plans are available in all 50 states and D.C and feature lower Tier 1 and Tier 2 copays at preferred retail pharmacies.Anyone have an idea of how much the US Government will be handing CVS/Aetna for all the ""free, no cost services?"
up div and buy back few shares to stamp out the shorts!
