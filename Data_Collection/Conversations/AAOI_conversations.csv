How does DataCenter rev drop 60% from 2Q20 to 2Q21 (eg. $52m to $22m). CATV saved this quarter (and deserves congrats). But I’m worried about DC segment sales rev wipeout. AAOI really needs to find recurring revenue streams for a more healthy future. Only so many one-time sales opportunities out there with the magnitude to move the needle.
"This is pure manipulation of the price. Small market cap. 0 interest loan, now the street guys can afford to have short position for so long.We have to wait with patience. Strong demand because of multi years 5G cycle. Don't worry. At the end of the year, it will cross 20 for sure."
"Just read the transcript. On the positive side, the company proved it can shift production to the US and Taiwan. On the negative side, it costs more. On the positive side, the forced work from home activity has caused customers to get nervous about their network, which means more orders. Also on the positive side, 5 new customers including 2 in the 5G area. On the negative side, Q2 is projected as another loss. Overall, not a horrible quarter and call considering the COVID impact."
"Broke through 200 DMA - if we can hold above, looking to go towards ~44-45 to match similar upward movement from 35-40. Wouldn't be surprised to see this thing approach 50 to 55 going into earnings with this level of momentum and the huge outstanding short pct."
"Wow, the volume, I didn’t notice it till someone mentioned it here"
I think this will be $15 by earnings. I’m not sure why this tanked last ER when their guidance is very bullish. The only reason they missed earnings last qtr was due to Covid not necessarily product weakness. 5G in China should help.
"After reading the Q2 results and listening to the CC, the only clairity I see is the lack thereof. 100G stalled, Any decent 400G revenue possibly next year, 5G telecom unknown, CATV revenue constrained. Forget profitability, how do they stay afloat going forward. I'm resigned to the fact the only thing that can save us is an activist investor. I don't see the current leadership selling out."
"5-day chart is looking great. Not a lot of volume, but the direction is up. I say the low volume indicates that we bounced off the bottom and those looking for $5 aren't very smart and don't understand tech."
"August 5th, couldn't wait!"
"Today Paul Silverstein with B. Riley wall street analyst,gave a buy rec. on AAOI . according to Tipranks he is rated as 5star with #195 out of 4739 analysts,his success rate is 52% and has a 24.3 % ave. return."
Looks like initial resistance on the charts is around $11.
Looks like this will be heading to 5 due to poor results.
Who thinks this will be $20 stock next year?
Just bought back in. Yeah it has ran and I might be able to buy cheaper but something is brewing here
"Look, companies have to go through rigorous testing to meet standards, aaoi had all the big companies and obtained new ones. Companies like amazon will negotiate the best volume price and margins might be affected however I believe this is offset by the vertical integration. These analysts were wrong about aaoi losing customers to competition, data centers were just holding off not changing vendors. Very weird that rosenblatt would be beg then positive and now negative again ? Something doesn’t smell right ."
Applied Optoelectronics is up 5.13% to 7.79
"Thank you Zacks! In and out in less than 24 hours and the buy from last week paid off, too. Remember Zacks=Always wrong. The louder and more they say sell, you buy!"
"Anything less than 12 USD , doesn't make sense. Their yearly revenue is 200M, market capital is 207M doesn't make sense to me. Having said that, I am no body here. WS decide whether it will go up or down! May be really owners is only 3-5% or even less. They have nothing to do unless holding the stock!"
"This has been a terrible stock to invest. Only a buyout can guarantee 5 to 6 times the current price. NPTN was down when they reported Q4, then got back to pre-Q4 earning level; AAOI on the other hand kept going down. A good earning surprise and bullish Q2 can double the stock; however, i am not very hopeful about that. Analysts lost faith in AAOI management who always brag about being 2 quarters away from growth. Let see what they say this time if they can't beat earning and give a good forecast. I have been wrong so many times on this stock that I'm ready for the worst for the earnings. But I still believe that is undervalued when compared to NPTN. AAOI is under 1X sales while NPTN is at close 2X sales. If they guide anything below 60M for Q2, then the stock could go down some more. At this time i rather just owned out of the money long calls. Who knows we could be 1 year away from growth. The only good scenario for investors is a sale. Even a merger between AAOI and NPTN will make sense to probably get the two companies profitable. It just sucks to have a company being dead money for almost 3 years with management always saying the same story."
Does management want to give everyone $20 now or a possible $40 in 18 months..............
From Today.... Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google announced Wednesday it will invest $13 billion in new data centers across the United States as it looks to continue expanding its cloud business. .... Even if Google does not buy from AAOI this will still help the industry and price levels for AAOI and their competitors. Data center expansion is a massive global trend and there will be enough of the pie to go around!!!
"Monday will be interesting. With a big order of 2.5m shares at close I would have expected a 10% close at the end of the day. 5% is weak especially since it happened at the close, which makes me to believe that shorts had a bunch of sale orders below 9, reasons why the SP wasn't going anywhere for the last few weeks. A big order like this got to be an institutional holder. which means the float just went down by more than 10%, and short interest probably above 20% by now. Just a thought."
"Wow, lower than the time of the pandemic in February 2020, this is bad. Would you load up or give up on AAOI and why?"
MTSI out of picture of competition. Looking at their guidance and current quarter the shorts thesis of MTSI taking on Amazon business away from AAOI is in dust now. Shorts better cover now
"In layman terms, AAOI latest action means that company committed to sell 4-4.5M shares (about 20% dilution to present float) at $17.7, close to book value, and will pay, on top of that, 5% interest till 2024. By and large, it is not the best deal and it explains market reaction easily. On the othe rhand, they need in many to pay construction loan that is, perhaps, short term."
Board members Salaries is not commensurate with the performance of this company. The leadership does not care much about the stockholders. Buy at your own risk. Good luck
I smell pop.
"@ Jeremy, I think your prediction is very wrong. I am bullish because of the following points. 1- This stock reached bottom in April and been in uptrend since then.2- In the end of may this stock was trade with heavy volume and big green candles at around $45/share (2 years daily graph). 3- historic support at price range of 38-40. goes back to April 2017. 4- current volume is very low indication of consolidation. If I wanted to bet I would bet on uptrend rather than downtrend. so If you holding shares, I would suggest to hold and see what would happen. If I wanted to invest I would wait for confirmation and probably get in when it crosses $50.BUT one thing for sure is that betting on this to go down is very risky and have all odds against it.Good luck everyone!"

Does anyone know a free website where you can see calls & puts for 6+ months out for AAOI (or any stock for that matter)?
will it continue to go up tomorrow?
"""AOI operates three different manufacturing locations, only one of which is in China. All three locations are capable of manufacturing transceivers with Taiwan and China both capable of manufacturing these products in high volume. Because of our vertical integration strategy, we also manufacture many of the components and sub-assemblies that are used in these modules.The diversity of our manufacturing operations both geographically and in terms of the types of products manufactured gives us significant flexibility and adapting our production location in order to maximize cost efficiency. As political condition changed, we believe that we are well-positioned to adapt and will continue to plan for such contingencies."""
someone started making the wave...
"analysts/shorts had two claims:- AAOI losing customers, tariff causing huge losed for AAOI. mgmt finally crushed those two points with actual facts getting in a new chinese customer(baba/bidu) and describing how if tariff does happen it wont affect them. i see now point shorts have now to keep shorting this stock. they all will have to cover and i m not selling mine below 65."
Breakout tradeWATCH for breakout above 46.73
Running in low battery
"AAOI has beat the past 4 out of 4 quarters. From August to September, analysts have gone from 6 holds and 2 buys to 2 underperform, 1 hold, 3 buys, and 3 strong buys. Analyst average price target is now $15.71. Revenue needs to come in at $55-60M+ next quarter with strong forward guidance. If that happens we run over $10 quickly, imo. Remember last year in Q3 they surprised with a $76M quarter. I think we'll see strengthening over the next few quarters and 2022 will be the year for AAOI to come back from the ashes."
"My guess on the rev guide for Q3 is for modest improvement from Q2, probably mid 60's. I think if this company will have a turnaround quarter and return to profitability it will happen in Q4."
AAOI have a history to jump $10/$15. But first let’s see earnings. I think $40 to $50 year end possible. I can’t believe that lots of g4rb4ge companies trading higher and not making any money.
Alibaba is the “New Large customer in China” for AAOI. AAOI has been in business for 20 years. Rock solid balance sheet. Does anyone really think a few bad quarters will put AAOi out of business? AAOi will go to 100 before it goes to 20.
"Whisper number now higher than consenus and guidance. Wall St expects a beat. 0.20 - 0.34 was guidance. Consensus 0.33, whisper is currently 0.36."
Losing market share...where is it going?
At exactly 4:07 EST you will the AH price gap up by 28%. By close of Business Friday the stock will have hit 53 at some point.
Amazon $10B pentagon cloud contract - has to be sourced with US based suppliers. AAOI increasing capacity in CWDM4 while others leaving the market - gives AAOI great chance at supplying for the contract as well.
"""Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and a slow end to the year, we are encouraged by the double-digit revenue growth we delivered in 2020, which was driven by growth in each of our three major business segments,"" CEO Dr. Thompson Lin said in a statement. ""We are pleased to have secured an additional 30 total design wins in 2020, on par with last year's total."""
"Why is this company selling at 1X revenue? Something wrong with management, not enough r&d or too much competition. hmm"
"As of today Estimated Short Interest is below 10 million shares and going down as Shorts are covering and going long.Even they can't fight the upward trend, as the trend is your friend, my friend."
"From the cfo during their investor presentation last month: ""the biggest growing telecom application is 5G - we've seen early deployments of 5G and we have several design wins for products that are used in 5G networks"". Wonder if any of those wins are substantial and if they could be a significant growth driver going forward?"
Wow close at the high!
"Highlights from their 4Q/2017 call: FB signs 3yr deal with $125M commit in year 1 (2018); top 3 customers represented 78% of total revenue in 2017 and 73% in 4Q2017; company signed 49 new customers which will produce revenue in 2018; price pressure is expected to lessen in 2018 as compared to 2017; company reduced its costs by 36% while producing 100G solution so it will continue to be the lowest cost provider; company expects 2nd half of 2018 to be strong; gross margins are expected to remain in the 41% to 45% range; company will spend $109M in CAPEX in 2018 to build out factory in China that will help it deliver more inventory so it expects (and is spending) significant increases in sales; as a reminder, global data center customers and opportunities are plentiful for AAOI to grow and succeed; AAOI beat EPS targets; AAOI missed top line target of $85M by bringing in $80M, even still growing YoY top line by 47%; AAOI is a very good long term play once the shorts shake out; this is a very, very healthy company with a bright future; I'm long and will remain confident things will improve later this year"
"Seeking Alpha has an interesting take on AAOI and said that a Short Squeeze is imminent with 78% of shares Shorted and Shorts having less than 13 days to cover those Shorts.Seeking Alpha breaks down the Rosenblatt upbeat article and gives good analysis of why AAOI is going higher.Google Dr. Chih Hsiang Lin PH.D and do your research on him he is Taiwanese not Chinese and has been in American decades, not years and AAOI main customer base is in America and is based in Sugar Land Texas.Conclusion is AAOI is moving higher and it will be very soon, those who don't cover their Shorts today will have to do so next week at much higher prices.Which is good for everyone, except The Short guy's."
"If I was aoi I would not pre announce.. no obligation to do so. Too much liability in doing so. Look what happened last time. Good company good products good market perhaps not as fast as previous but still good. I doubt they are losing market share, I do believe there is slow down due to the tax law change and technology change over. Be patient"
"For the second quarter of 2021, the company currently expects: Revenue in the range of $51 million to $56 million. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 25.5% to 27.5%. Non-GAAP net loss in the range of $3.8 million to $5.6 million, and non-GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.14 to $0.21 using approximately 27.2 million shares."
is todays volume a misprint? 2M shares in last 15 min?
I'm really looking forward to earnings.....
I'll buy more at 6.00 and then 4.00 then pray..
"The data center market is going to turn over, AAOI has more opportunity ahead.that is market trend, don,t against it."
"AAOI now the cheapest of all the optical stocks selling for about a 13 PE on 2018 and an 11 PE on 2019 EPS estimates. Now according to the CC, AAOI said to expect 100% yoy growth in 100G transceiver demand going forward, and through 2019. To me, this suggests at least 40% EPS growth going forward for 2019 vs 2018. Seems a strong growth story to me, and cheap for an 11 PE going forward"
So now what? Heading All time low ?
I just went back and re-read the Q1 Earnings Call for AAOI. I am convinced the Short community is wrong and has been a “self fulfilling prophecy”or Group Think. AAOI Management very much wanted to increase their credibility with the investor community and they were still very optimistic about Q2 and 2nd half of 2018. I am convinced that their desire to increase credibility long term would be more important than increasing short term investor optimism. If things have dramatically deteriorated over the past 90 days they would have come out with a warning. If we are surprised with a bad quarter and bad guidance AAOI Management will have lost ALL credibility for the foreseeable future. I expect a sold Q2 and GREAT guidance. 57 By Friday !!
According to super stocksEPS this year 19%NY 65%Insiders own 8%Inst 52%Maybe finally something is cooking.
"I don't know about the rest of you, but my investment style is buying stocks when they're beat up, and selling them when they recover. That's how Warren Buffet made his fortune. I accumulated 30K+ shares of AMD starting at $2 and averaging up to $10 when everyone thought AMD was a gonner....it's now knocking on $100 again. I bought 51K shares of NOK in the $3-4 range while everyone ignored it and its stagnant stock price, and it's now starting to turn around and I'm poised to benefit. I bought 70K shares of CPSH at around $1 average over a few years, traded it a little, and sold it all early this year all the way up to $20. I've been investing on my own since 1988, 33 years, and that strategy has worked for me time and time again. Only once that I can remember did I get burned by accumulating and averaging down. I don't chase high-flying over-priced stocks and don't buy into ""momentum"" because you never know when the stock is going to crash and never go back up. I've spent the past 2+ years accumulating a large position in AAOI and averaging down as much as I can. I'd buy more now but I have a lot invested already in my 51K+ shares and am managing portfolio risk since I'm retired. Sure there's risk. But I believe AAOI is a good company in a great market, and will benefit from 5G and other markets in the next couple of years. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so."
"Once the smarties saw the stock was about to fall out of the Russell Index, the selling pressure was very strong from the $12 level - and they were right. Now that selling should almost be exhausted, making the stock ready for a major bounce."
Last moment pop up its not only AAOI.
SELL
Do they have enough capacity for FB and MSFT etc?
Shorts that stay until earnings will have pressed their bet too hard. I suggest covering . Same as not selling at 100.Earnings guidance will make this issue into a rocket on the 22nd IMOGL
"this stock is a non winner, its heading lower"
"For any serious investor in AAOI I recommend reading the transcript of the earnings conference call. It clears up a lot of the reasons behind the weak guidance and the lower gross margins, per management. Basically with the scarcity of parts they're having to pay more to get anything so they can ship products. Supply chain disruptions are affecting almost everything. They also discuss the Microsoft situation. I feel a little better about my investment now, so I'm cautiously optimistic as they still see upside in 2H. I think the stock is going to do what it's done since the last ER, basically bob around $7-8 until something changes. Still holding and plan to hold for another 2 quarters minimum, through 2H. Glad my AMD and NOK are doing well, and I'm closely watching for the pending IIVI results this coming week. RAD is stagnant like AAOI and has the same problem of not posting profits."
Never listen to Cramer
"Wow, so all of those design wins and added customers do not translate to better guidance?"
"Forward PE = 11, Price to Sales = 2, Return on Equity 32%, Current Ratio 3, 68% of Float Short. Rocket fuel mix. Launch on any good news."
"Again, why not just sell the technology and patents for $20+/- per share and close up ???"
Should they just sell the company for $15 to $20/share and give up?
conference call right now so lit. First time seeing them talk with so much confidence. confirmed they didnt loose any market share just architecture changes made things bad. shipments doubling second half and then doubling year over year for 2019.
"Too bad the high volume didn't carry over to today. While volume was a little over average, it wasn't exceptional. We still have a few more weeks until the ER. I'm waiting patiently with a boatload of shares."
I’m gonna do what I’ve always done when earnings comes around with this stock. Sell all and buy back at a huge discount. It simply never fails with this stock. No one should be scared that anything different will occur this time.
Well yet another earnings disappointment and weak Q3 guidance. Q3 looks to be flat with q2 which was marginally better than q1. Sigh….
After hours volume is also high today.
"AAOI currently has $3.00 Cash per PPS. With new convertible debt issue, cash per pps would be 6.00 plus. Current book value is 16.5. Post issue of new equity, it would be 17.5. Revenue of 250M and market cap of 270M would be a good proposition for investors. Cashflow from new equity issue would make AAOI debt free and saves some interest charges. Where is the negative aspect for this company other than lagging sales that is common for any corp. What is the risk here to invest at 13 or 14 pps levels?"
Takeover target for sure.
You don’t get 15 if it’s trading at 7. Best you get is 9. It had to be at least 12 to get 15. Remember OCLR they only got 9 fir it. Or was it 10?
Applied Optoelectronics is up 5.18% to 7.52
"Here is what I like about AAOI and the upcoming 8/6 2Q20 earnings call. Short interest dropped again as reported on 6/15 to 5,409,105 shares which is the lowest level in years. I believe this is because Management forecasted a 45% increase in revenue from 1Q20, with margins returning to normal levels. I also like that a (outside) board member purchased 10K shares. Insider buying is a great sign. Finally, winning 2 5G customers in 1Q20 in China could be huge. All good signs. Looking forward to this next call. If they hit their numbers and put out a solid 3Q20 forecast, we could be off to the races (e.g. ~ $20/share +). I think this is what has the shorts concerned."
Crazy volume today..even after hours. something is brewing
They will be back on track once the 5 pending design wins are closed. Hoping to seal the deals ASAP.
"Why in the hell do they have 2,682 full time employees according this site? I'm calculating the average yearly cost to pay that many employees about 175,000,000. Total revenues are about 200,000,000...leaving almost nothing to spend on anything else. Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on here? They need to eliminate about half of their employees to get this thing to where they need to be for only 200M in revs."
"revenue $65.2MM, improved gross margin 21.1%, non gaap loss $0.24 per share. Q3 revenue expected $76 to $83MM."
Higher highs !!! 
"Wouldn't it be nice if AAOI was setting up to be the next Game Stop, wouldn't that be something, to squeeze the 4 million shares short out"
"As of 11-30 settlement date, short interest Decreased to 11.430 million from the 12.369 million shares a 939,000 drop or a 7.6% drop."
The Microsoft data center upgrade is being delayed by other factors - they have already designed in AAOI products - be patient. Having Microsoft as your biggest customer could be worse.
LITE remains optimistic about the future of this industry.................
True Value at Present: $30 to $50 ---- likely to stabilize $32-$38 in 1-3 months
Above $10 soon...haha.
I guess some people took profit this morning when it reached near $50. Keeping patient and courageous.
They will bring this up to $20 in the near term. There’s lots of new companies with much smaller or no revenues at all that are valued at billion dollars.
"Assume this recent bump is tied to the China Trade deal that will be signed later this morning. Regardless of how management tried to play down the ""China"" risk, it has to be very helpful given they have 3 manufacturing facilities including (its newest) China, Taiwan and Texas. This is great long term news for AAOI."
"Rosenblatt , Jin Zhang, April 11, 2018 pumped AAOI as a possible turnaround using pricing to gain market share and then tubed it exactly 60 days later saying margins will decline and putting out a lower earnings estimate than average analyst. I agree he should be investigated."
"“The 100-gig orders should double to roughly $80 million per quarter in the second half, based on the backlog of committed orders that have not yet been shipped. The emerging longer-term trends are also looking good, as the quarterly 100G sales should double again in 2019.”"
"Market cap by is very low. Upside huge. Buy and hold tight. Higher bandwidth requirement is explosive into the next ten years straight. DDR5, 5G wireless standard, Bitcoin explosive mining. Massive databases. Buy the trend should be great while stock price is low."
"Looks like the bleeding will stop here or maybe a few percent from here. We probably have a bottom.CATV and Telecom was great in Q1and will probably help performance in Q2 also. Assuming everything they said comes true, Q2 could be the only negative earnings quarter left. Hope the positive outlook can bring the stock above 12 in the next 2 months."
The big US data centers need this company to thrive......................
will close today over 15.....if I'm wrong...I shave my head
Still say it is time to sell the company - if they don't get $15 plus they can always back out..........
Looking good in a bloody market...haha
This is a coordinated effort to squeeze out retail investors. AAOI is a sound company with amazing customers and amazing products. Institutional investors know we are heading into a 2-3 year massive growth cycle in all things optical! Do not sell your shares!
I haven’t been here for a while but I have to say that investors here truly have a high tolerance for pain. If wives and husbands were as loyal as aaoi investors there would be no divorce or infidelity.
Revenue of $54 million is pretty light but within their guidance. They missed the bottom end of their gross margin guidance and hit non-GAAP eps range. Boring ER.
"ACIA beats earnings by less, misses revenue by less, and guides down to nearly no earnings for Q1. ACIA down 10 %AAOI posts a beat by more, misses revenue by more, guides down to $.30 and has an agreement with FB for more revenue in 2018 than they had from Amazon last year. That's right, the same Amazon that had $55M in one quarter... AAOI down 20 %.The 2nd half will be a screamer, and the CWDM4 10km narrative is real based on what ACIA is showing...OCLR, LITE, ACIA, all now losing to competitive price environment while AAOI continues to maintain margin and lock in revenue......."
FNSR is claiming it will have low cost transceivers for enterprise and data center business that will “enable” it to compete and take meaningful market share. I don’t understand the competitive landscape that well. How easy is it too take market shares and what kind of threat is this posing for AAOI? Thanks.
Anybody thinks this is going to 5?
60% rise in this stock over next 6 months is likely
"Massive Options Volume YESTERDAY in AAOI.... They knew the debt issue was coming .... This should be illegal! Applied Optoelectronics Inc (Symbol: AAOI) saw options trading volume of 4,895 contracts, representing approximately 489,500 underlying shares or approximately 43.6% of AAOI's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 1.1 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $20 strike put option expiring June 21, 2019 , with 700 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 70,000 underlying shares of AAOI"
"AAOI will probably trade below 6 before next quarter results. and if guidance for q4 comes in at below 55M then we will see 5. Only 2 straight quarters of 75M plus revenue would take this stock to 15 or 20. 400G wins are positive news but this will turn into a big upside only when Microsoft, Amazon and others will begin to upgrade their infrastructure. The upgrade is probably going to materialize around Q2 of next year. Hope by then CATV will remain strong, 5G will pick up and there would be a meaningful 400g revenue. The inventory normalization from 100G will not add any meaningful revenue."
If innolight is gaining market share where's their announcements? Shouldn't they be advertising that? In general companies tend to stick with known good suppliers / vendors. Price is negotiable whereas quality isn't. I'd be surprised if aoi is losing market share. Maybe a slowdown in orders driven by tax law changes? Aoi won several recent awards on their 100 G products! This should be beneficial
Anyone who’s been in AAOI for a few years knows how fast this thing can move up (and down)!
"The great thing with this stock is that I still believe it has a long term future because of 5G, but you just have to manage it carefully not to incur short and medium term losses. If it goes down I still believe in the long term story and if it goes up I can always take some short term profits just to rebalance and make sure I have a decent amount of cash."
"I have been away from this since the quality issue back at end of 3Q! At this level, I am again interested. Does anyone have an idea how their business is really doing - shipping activity in and out of the TX plant, rumors, anything indicative of level of activity? Memory guys are all saying second half recovery as inventory comes back into balance and data centers ramp. I would think that could apply to AAOI as well. This has always been volatile and when a stock goes from $100 to the teens, people watch and wait just to see! A glimmer of good news and this could bounce! Is it going to bounce and recover???"
Why such a big bounce back after hours??? Don't see any parti
selll
Buy the trend. 5G requires optical products
"As a reminder, for AOI, a design win occurs when we have successfully completed both the technical qualification of the product, as well as received an initial order from the customer.In addition to these two design wins, we also have successfully completed technical qualifications on five other 400G opportunities.We are optimistic that many of these qualifications will become design wins in the near future once we receive orders for these products from our customers. The technical qualifications are with two different data center operators and the data center equipment OEM. All are U.S. based companies. We are encouraged by the traction we are seeing and expect that 400G will begin its ramp with us later in Q3."
I bottom fish AAOI. I sold the $7 puts 3 days ago to collect premium. AAOI is not a long term hold stock.
"Hay Lazerator can you alert me when AAOI gets to $5. I'm thinking about shorting it, but it's not really like me. It's very tempting though."
How is the 2.5 million shares investor taking this going down?
"Part 1: Some of this will repeat other posters, but wanted to get as much as possible in one post.- Names AMZN, FB, & MSFT as top 3 customers, all above 10%- Cowen expects 50% growth in cloud CapEx for industry, AAOI doesn't argue- Reason for AMZN downturn - they purchased more inventory early LY than needed and improved their infrastructure to where they gained speed without the need for improved transceivers (temporarily)- All AAOI hyper-scale customers intend to grow data centers- AAOI has not lost market share to AMZN- Volumes of 100g will double in second half of 2018 compared to first half, and will double in 2019 (6m transceivers) compared to 2018 (3m transceivers)"
I just wonder if the companies who own these data centers are dragging their feet a bit to take advantage of the latest fastest device. Aoi just got to 400 bps and now Ii-vi is talking about 800 and faster?
Great price appreciation. The volume however not exciting. Wish we had multiple of avg daily volume.
Delays with Microsoft data center upgrades - their biggest customer - but other new approvals look good for 2022.
Super disappointed in 3Q guidance after being told on last 2 calls that they expected wins and growth to return in second half of the year. Would love to hear whatever happened to their 2 5G Chinese customers who had Huawei supply chain problems. Does it take 6 months to resolve supply chain problems or does Stefan Mury / Chief Strategist just make this stuff up and NO analysts asks follow up questions to his excuses? Always making excuses….pathetic.
"I'm bullish on AAOI because after seeing their 2Q21 results, for the first time, I see they have 2 major revenue streams. The data center stream has always been lumpy. With their large customers moving to 400g we should see nice revenue in the coming quarters. Most exciting is the $27M they reported in their cable/MSO business (e.g. more than data center $22M in the quarter). This growing segment has strength going into and beyond 2022. Assume @Lazerator is correct that their SP will rise once they reach $70M+....between these TWO segments it's hard to believe this won't happen and do so more consistently in the quarters ahead. I was always a bit worried with just transceivers for data centers (5G aside). I believe 3Q results will be in-line or just ahead of their targets but guidance for 4Q (and forward) should be much, much better. Best of luck to the longs."
"I have to admit that I'm starting to lose confidence in AAOI but I'm not ready to throw in the towel just yet. They continue to meet their guidance and they've beat on earnings regularly. Revenue is the issue and it doesn't seem to be turning around very strongly. The Q3 revenue of $76M gave me hope last year that they were recovering, but Q1 and Q2 dampened my hopes. My plan is to see what happens in 2H2021 and decide what to do after that. I have too much invested in AAOI while other opportunities pass me by. So we wait........"
"Ok, so they missed rev by $3m and margins were lower than expected. They booked the missed rev in April. No big. But, 2Q implies a 45% + increase in rev and margins back to 23-25%. Also love 2, 5g customer wins in China. We are nearly half way through 2Q so bank on the guidance, short of another crisis. I listened and liked what I heard. I’m long and buying more. Go and listen to other company 1Q calls and guidance. AAOI is a winner."
CFO Murray just added 3k shares. Hope that triggers a small squeeze tomorrow.
7.25 to 7.30 tomorrow as stocks decline going into the weekend.
"For long term AOI investors it's worth going to the company's website and then to Investor Relations and then to Events & Presentation to watch the 38 minutes presentation by Stefan Murrry, AOI CFO & Chief Strategy Officer to Needham Security Conference. He articles that 2021 looks very good for AAOI. Mostly due to their China 5G customer orders (anticipated). It's a good listen."
Lazerator since you have 50k shares of AAOI. Are you going for a board seat?
So a beat all around?
Daily volume of 3.74MM and last minute 3:59PM about 2.5MM shares.
2.5% up in a down market 
How much money of the $65 Billion in the Broadband portion of the infrastructure bill will go to AAOI?
I work in the business of testing these manufactured fiber optic transceivers which is AOI only product. I’m in Taiwan and China and sell equipment for all of them. This data center fiber optic market has a ways to go before the up cycle begins. This in my opinion is a short pop as we wait for the upside of the cycle to begin with 400G.
"Is this a semiconductor company? As far as I know, every single semiconductor company went through the roof for the past few years like at least 10 times. This stock is dead here."
More frequent techbubble comments tend to coincide with higher stock prices. Coincidence?
"Just read the transcript and I encourage all to do the same. I understand 1Q result was disappointing and apparently many have doubts about the validity of the guidance, but I must say it was a great call regarding 2Q and beyond. To me, the management basically said ‘bad times are behind us and things are going to be great going forward’. Couldn’t help feeling that the management was holding back a little... Q&A was rather short, indicating analysts didn’t have “problems”. Also for Amazon, all will agree it is better to have a diversified customer base than bullied by one. Management believes its overall market share will increase this year! I get it, stock price will be moved by traders in short term but fundamentals seem strong for AAOI now and value investors will see them soon or later. It’s almost like AAOI is maturing. I agree tomorrow will be interesting in terms of trading. Based on AH price and all the bashing, price will drop at the bell, but then what? Guidance is very positive. May not be in 2Q numbers, the management seem to expect great 2H. Price should be forward looking, right?"
SGH Sector(s): TechnologyIndustry: Semiconductors Did great earnings. I hope AAOI will follow trend.
"Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ: AAOI) reported Q2 EPS of $0.64, $0.19 better than the analyst estimate of $0.45. Revenue for the quarter came in at $87.8 million versus the consensus estimate of $77.82 million."
Would be a shot in the arm if the insiders would buy substantial $$ of their stock.
Looks like we may get a shot at 5 in the next week.
"director, moore just bought 22,400 shares. shows confidence"
"The trend should still good. Memory standard DDR 5 and 5 G wireless must require higher optical components or else you will have bottleneck at some other networks. Buy the trend. The world still in a pandemic. But with 3 vaccines approved and another one from nvax coming by next month, this pandemic will end. The trend should be good for this sector? It’s a matter of timing. When will DDR 5 and larger 5G rollout. It depends on those two transitions. Analysts know. They decide when to buy more."
"Good to see insiders executing options and adding to their shares, but not selling them. Today two insiders added 2.5% to their shares."
I thought Applied Opto will benefit from the infrastructure bill. Isn't 5G and the high speed internet build out still coming?
Will they look to enhance shareholder value or look after their own interests......................
"Great Price action, much beyond my expectation. The stock is getting overbought, so consolidation is expected. My gut feeling is telling me that this stock is going to be a winner."
Sweet that they own their own semiconductor fab in Texas. Way below asset value alone?
"If simply announcing that you are going to report quarterly earnings lifts your stock price by 6%, then perhaps the stock is severely undervalued."
"Hanging around $7, will fly in few weeks."
I guess they beat the expected loss of ($0.18) with the ($0.15) number. Time to get excited?
Worth over $15/share to IIVI?
I sold every single share yesterday. My only mistake is that I started buying back too early in the premarket. My average is now 10.83.
"As my core holding is $58, I added more last week at $36 and added another 10,000 shares today at $49.60. This stock used to be $95 when I bought $58 and sold between $89 to $92. Now I am owning 19000 shares totally at less than $58, I am totally ready for its recovery back over $58 no less."
"Interesting question arose to me after reading today's analyst opinion (below). Do you think AAOI ever gets Alphabet's (GOOGL) business considering their investment in InnoLight? If yes, when? I'll let a few of you chime in before I give my opinion. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/eb093b4a-d9fe-3562-98ea-9b657a0f71eb/applied-optoelectronics.html"
Anybody betting this has bottomed?
Stuck under $8. Need a big push.
"Set up a hedge - long AAOI, short LITE ???"
"5G should help accelerate AAOI’s products in much higher volume and demand. I’m betting on that thesis. Also, covid vaccine could change everything soon. Buy low sell high."
"Just learned DE Shaw (yes, the giant hedge fund) now owns 22.2% of AAOI as March 5, 2020:http://investors.ao-inc.com/static-files/19f06bb7-7070-4dd3-86a1-f94e789dd82eThe stock is going to $30 or will be an M&A target."
This  didn’t even move up before earning. On previous earnings this went to $12-$15 before report .
This guy Jun Zhang is ranked 4034 out of 4828 analysts with single  rating
Struggling to hit $8
"If investors applied the same overkill scrutiny to stocks like TESLA, as they do with this stock, Tesla would be about $1."
This company reminds me of a telecom company I invested in 20 years ago. They captivated investors in the belief that the big contracts were right around the corner. That went on for years while the competition surpassed them and merged with larger companies. Ownership maintained their independence and eventually there was a shell of a company left. Ultimately they sold off certain pieces for a couple bucks leaving behind the remnants. I haven't followed them for years since my losses. But I see they're trading at $0.80 a share now. The moral of the story is directed to the AAOI mgmt. Time to take what you can before the end of the year. All your competitors a passing you up and or merging. Technology waits for nobody and doesn't care what you did in the past.
Looks like the new qualifications are going really well - the Microsoft connection will really help the stock price.
I guess the longer this stock remains below the $12 level............the more likely it is to be acquired. Valuable patents and technology.
Another analyst that sent their lacky
Who wished they never bought this stock
"Man, 17% short interest, days to cover near 6, low float, 47% institutions (including Blackrock, Vanguard, and state street) AND $AAOI actually has a bullish business case and a forward looking P/S right around one. Add to that a market environment where hedge funds are trimming short positions to de-risk and there’s FOMO hype on squeeze candidates, and we may have something..."
Guys let’s stop talking about buyout. Myself I don’t want that if buyout price comes up $15-$20. AAOI can be $50 by itself after 3-4 good earnings. Good luck to all. IMO
How come they gave misleading information to spike the price to 12+ a quarter before. Any chance of this recovering.
"Market is already pricing in a miss on Q4 with bad guidance for Q1. So if that happens, not more downside. If earnings are okay, and guidance half decent then we will see a nice pop. I think investors are losing focus on what this company really does. Don't have to say it, but big CC coming up. A lot of questions that need to be answered for sure."
Put the company up for sale and let potential buyers outbid each other?
"This is definitely dead money for another year, and not a take over target as long as data center is still weak. 400G can at best reach current level data center revenue in Q2 of next year. Q3 guidance was weak. Not sure Q4 will be any better and Q1 is always the slow month "
Is this stock’s massive price decline over the last 2-3 years due to Huawei? We’re they a big supplier to them ? Trying to get a handle on the stick.
"Can someone help me understand what will happen when the shorts of AAOI eventually have to cover? With 70% of shares short how will they eventually be able to cover all those positions. Even if the stock craters to say 25, how will there be sufficient shares available to cover that many short positions? I am having a hard time understanding the risk reward equation for all these shorts. Let’s say best case for shorts the stock goes to 20, from here they make 50% but if the stock pops it will pop to 50 or 60 and there will massive short squeeze. Why would shorts continue to take this massive risk with a limited upside to the short position."
Picking up momentum!!!
stock was down today in anticipation of a bad datacenter number by nvda which was actually one of only areas that were strong. stock should rip tomorrow
"Short Interest for the period to 4/13 published yesterday is virtually unchanged - 14,513,825 shrs vrs 14,544,345 for the previous. There was almost no short covering although the stock price went up 20%. I guess the short case is built on an expectation of dismal guidance on 5/8 which will drive the price down to new lows. That may happen, butif 1st qtr was the bottom for revenue & Lin projects bigger numbers going forward, I don't see how the shorts escape serious difficulty."
After hours still below $10..................
"This company has bright future with the lack of competition. And, the future looks bright for these kind of high tech. Who else has 400g? ++++"
This is currently trading under book value. Book value states the market cap would be 280million and this is trading at 192 million. No brainer long here. Earnings coming up on Aug 5.
Volume is pretty good. Need a big push on the green side.
very interesting trading patterns after hitting all time low. last 2 week having minimal effect on red market day and price controlled by its own. I hope something is brewing.
Microsoft is doing so good. Hope they ramp up their data center upgrades and AAOI make huge out of it.
I need some advice. My cost basis is 43.78. This stock seems to be bleeding slowly. Should I take the loss and sell it? Do you think the earnings will be positive?
Interesting article from SA: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4182184-applied-optoelectronics-strategic-buyout-candidate
"I'm inclined to agree that no pre-announce means the revenue & earnings will be within guidance.This should stabilize the stock while the market waits for the CC & 2018 forward guidance:""For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company currently expects:Revenue in the range of $81 million to $90 million. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 41% to 43%. Non-GAAP net income in the range of $16.6 million to $19.5 million, and non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.96 using approximately 20.3 million shares."""
I'm thinking of going short on what I own. Any counter arguments why it's a bad idea? I expected a little more life before earnings. This stock seems dead.
AAOI will do well in 2018
"To much attention given to the shorts. Sure, the shorts had their fun, and AAOI was WAY oversold, but focus on what was said at the investor conference. The fundamentals are improving for AAOI.I posted this 6 hours ago............. My point is, they just told us Wednesday that they did over 800,000 lasers in the month of March, a record for them. They said Wednesday around 3M transceivers this year. The math works. They also told us 6 million transceivers next year, or a 100% increase in demand. My point is simple. With 70% of in house production by end of 2018, up from 35% in 2017, AAOI will continue to be low cost producer. More sales of 100G 200G out of the 6 millions transceivers in 2019 bring higher gross margin then the fading 40G. With Lumentum and Macom pulling back on their production, more market share for AAOI. With their design platform and hundreds of engineers in China, the designs wins will keep coming like last quarter. My point, the stars are aligning for AAOI. If the market valued AAOI at $100 in 2017, what is the value NOW with lower costs, higher margins, less competition and 100% more demand in 2019? The market says $42 now. So, the market values it 60% lower today than in 2017? Take advantage of this, lots of upside to be had still. Lots.......................Just think about the advantage AAOI will have with 70% in house production by end 2018 and how they will leverage it with 100% growth with 6 million transceivers in 2019. Never should of hit the $20's or 30's, but that is Wall St for you. Always swings to far down and up. Time for a major up swing. Should pull back some Friday IMO. If so, grab some and wait for triple digits again. The numbers work to support that price. We haven't even started 400G that is very complex and hard to build. Who is going to compete against them? Very very few...buy"
"I agree with the possibility of a powerful short squeeze, but there is also 5 months of stock between $35 and $50. That could be alot of sellers just happy to get back to break even."
Today's price movement tells you all you need to know about the respect the market has for Zhang's analysis.The real question is how he got even one star!
Up 4.6% already in after market hours...haha.
what's the basis for downgrade?
This would be hot in a month.
AAOI Market Makers are over their head. They must be short a large percentage of AAOI shares. They are trading like they a scared to move the stock when there's no volume. Longs are clearly not selling and Shorts are negative 17% of the float.
AAOI is really starting to remind me of MRVC communications. Wow how would have thought.
"The company has guided for revenue between $76 and $83M or $80M at the midpoint for Q3. According to Yahoo Finance, analysts have an average revenue of $79M. I hope they hit the high end of the range, and guide for revenue $80M or more in Q4. At that rate they'll be over $300M annualized revenue and the stock should soar."
Will they anounce a sale of the company tonight - patents and technology worth mucho $$$$$$$$$$?
"Someone sure is upbeat about future data center demands and the upgrade cycle. This is from the II-VI conference call: ""there is definitely a supercycle unfolding for upgrades across the world, particularly in North America to which we are participating, as I explained in my commentary about with the 200, 400, next-generation 800 and even 1.6 terabits per second transceivers. So that demand will continue at least for the next five years. The cycle will continue for quite a long time."" Interesting that AAOI stressed their new design wins and qualifications were all U.S. based."
"Maybe we have an Activist investor on board.. we all know someone bought at least 2.5 million shares with a single order. As of 3/31/2021 Blackrock is the largest holder with about 4million shares followed by vanguard at 1.5 million shares. Third place is at 600k shares. So if the 2.5 million shares is a long investor, we probably have the 2nd largest holder of aaoi shares right now."
"So the big saving grace is the two 400G design wins. Looking forward to more color on that. CATV was a surprisingly good driver, so data center business in Q4 with some 5G gravy should get this profitable by next year. Just seems like instead of 2H recovery, looking like Q4 and 1H of 2022. So 6 month delay… bummer, and routinely frustrating with this name, but at current P/S with the recovery story and some big name institutions on board, hard not to sit and wait for possible $20+ PPS (still seems in play)"
Applied Optoelectronics is up 5.27% to 7.59

"Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen (who downgraded AAOI) has a success rate of 50% with an average return of 11.9%.His best rating by a mile, ironically enough, was a BUY rating for AAOI, which snagged him a 665.2% gain, which obviously made most of all of that 11.9% return.Reckon after the price drops temporarily again for AAOI he'll give it another buy rating? Cos I sure do...Ref: https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/troy-jensen"
"I know everyone hates Zacks but I’ll put this out there anyway. And I know some will say this is old news. But according to Zacks the co will report yoy decline in revenue of 104.49% and net sales decline of 23.9% from a year ago period. My question is given how much the stock if down, is this already built into the stock price or will this actual news release cause a further decline of stock price back to the recent low? Zacks also indicated a forward PE of 10.94 and a peg of 0.73 both a discount to the industry average which suggest decent growth and higher stock price going forward. With no so good news coming and a bright forward looking outlook on the horizon, I think the best time to buy is right after earnings when there is a washout and the stock drops another 10 to 20%."
its only worth what people will pay for it
"What is going on with this? This should be coming on strong rather than falling off! FB loaded for 2nd half, data center ramping, trade fears sure - is there something else lurking we don’t know yet?Still have the last year debacle around AWS falling off in my mind!What’s in the rumor mill?"
