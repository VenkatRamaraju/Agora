Replaying the tape once again. Great quarter!
Merger good or bad! The lawyers think itâ€™s bad!
Not much chatter on these small bank message boards. Anyone here also like BSRR? Too bad Colombo retired. I noticed he's been selling his shares. BSRR is paying a higher div right now...also a slightly better return on equity.
Hey...
I have been banking with BMRC for 8 years now. Great personalized service. So I finally jumped in a couple of weeks ago. I have about 20 other securities and am amazed that there are only two people posting on this board. Not a big mover but happy to have some shares...
I just bought a few more today. It really jumps around quite a bit in price with no news. Must be the small float I guess. Thoughts?
Solid quarter. Beautiful dividend and nice 2 for 1 split. Thanks management!
Pin you out there?
"Dipped my foot today with a small parcel after a little research. Have been watching for a while. Does not seem very active, both in terms of volume, and on places like this. Time will tell if I've messed up."
Where is pin? How about any other non spammer?
Great day. WFC lead the way. The short term Yellen effect?
Accumulating.
"As of late. The small banks, 2 steps forward, 1 31/32 backwards."
Talking to myself. Great quarter.
Great earnings give us low volume and no change in share price. Weehoo! Kind of a sleeper but at least there are no bashers here. In for the long term anyway...
"BMRC would be a great but small, tuck in acquisition for PNC, now flush with cash by sale of its holdings in Black Rock. Management should be looking for an acquirer as CEO search to replace the talented Colombo has been stalled for a year."
Creeping back up. Ohhh so slow but good dividend.
