Ok... now we’re getting started
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
I think we’ll see a 30-40% rise before next earnings imo. Could potentially dip after earnings but gradually rise again until earnings in 2022
I think this could potentially be the next GME. A 20% rise premarket would catch short sellers off guard and they’d be forced to cover (which will ultimately lead to a 100%++ price surge). I’m going to post a few comments later today about why this company is extremely undervalued relative to its key competitors (see McDonalds).
"Hi investors. I am not an investor of WEN. I just live near by one of their stores and eat their quite regularly (I even worked there when I was in high school!). Today, drop of 10+% caught my attention along with 3+% down by MCD. For seasoned Wendys investors, I would like to ask. Yes, it will cost them 20 million. But for company with adjusted EBITDA $117.8 million last quarter, that does not seem to be huge number in relative sense. Also it is not like asset write down or anything. It was investment announced to expand their business. So I am just wondering if investors already decided breakfast will not be very profitable business for Wendys and discounting future costs? I personally like Wendys and places are usually busy and with P/E of 11, I think this is okay investment.If anyone has been investing in Wendys for long-term, I would much appreciate your insights.Thank you!"
"OMG! what's happening? I have held WEN forever, on two trading platforms. Just checked my Excel spreadsheet, I hold close to 800 shares with a cost average of $2.83/share. The only reason I bought some about 15 years ago originally was because where I worked a Wendy's was the closest, decent place to grab lunch, so our office staff did every day, M-F. I said, heck if we're gonna eat here every day I might as well buy stock in the company. Back then it was dirt cheap. This has been a true forever stock, ""buy it and forget it."" Wow! what's up!?"
Kramer likes Wendys = Strong Sell.
"I don't get why this is a meme stock. It is a successful, profitable company."
2 million shares traded pre market. Wonder if something is going on with it today
Don’t worry this will get pumped again premarket Friday.
"Can’t see premarket right now, hedge funds must be loading up. Probably gonna squeeze today"
"Wendy's drive -throughs, an ace in the whole in any economic or medical environment!"
"Up 139% in 14 days. Still waiting on that potential retest or at least a decent pullback. I want in so bad but I must remain disciplined. If I miss out, so be it, but I wish you all nothing but success. Congrats to those who got in on the initial bottom, gotta feel goooood."
"Worst case scenario we fall to $20, can’t see this falling much lower (assuming next earnings are good)"
Here we go! After hours is when the fun begins - SQUEEEEZE
"why is this so cheap, it seems the most reasonable by far of all fast food. stores are clean, good variety, etc. i think i will buy this one. look at McDonald's and chipotle both way over priced!"
$15 is ceiling Cannot break through. But we all know Weny is going back to $20's and more with international expansion soon so $29 is my next year target. Holding my shares keep Long.
"Double stack is a winner. It will take wen over $20. Lines are extremely long at 8pm in drive thru. Watch out quarter pounder, double stack taste great."
11th August (earnings) will be known as the Wendy’s Short Squeeze. I think we’ll see a 100-200% squeeze 
Another great day!! I predict $20+ by end of year.
Waiting for 23.25
This stock will be at least $40+ in two years. 50% return per annum is great
Who say ye that this will be $20 in 2018. The burgers are the best in the fast food world.
Seems like institution investors are buying relatively small amounts to keep volume low and accumulate over next day or so before apes start pumping. Fortunately we know their game and aren’t selling our share until minimum $40
WEN….let’s goooooooooooo 
I bought one of each breakfast sandwiches for my family and we split them. They were excellent! I spoke to the workers and they said the breakfast has been doing well so far! They opened before March 2nd in Florida’s I got a sneak peek!
I think if we finish above $25 on Friday we could potentially see a price surge on Monday (premarket). Going to keep buying shares whilst this is under $24
"Why is WEN considered to be fully valued with a stock in the mid 20's? I am new to investing and confused how a household name like WEN would be fully valued at even $29 when you have companies like Domino's over $400 share. Is it outstanding shares? I honestly don't know but to the untrained eye, WEN should be $100 share."
"With years of stock buy backs the share count has remained the same, they C suite and Board just keeps taking it with stock options and grants. That's why it languishes, they also dumped their stock on the meme pump like it #$%$ on fire when it popped to 30. The dividend is just back to where it was when they chopped it when Covid started. Nobody on Wall Street believes their puff jobs."
Great value here
Bought at $ 22.40
Under $23 would be a nice entry
After hours is when the fun begins
I smell something in the air. 
Dry power is going to pour in WEN will close above 29 today!️️️
Taking a leveraged position position tomorrow- this will easily jump up $2 minimum IMO
"Why is the stock price for Wendy's so high? Any measurement you use, it's overvalued by double. Not a rhetorical question, I like some food stocks, and have made nice money trading YUM and Sprouts, so I am not against the space, just seems like WEN is richly priced. Am I missing some potential it has that I haven't noticed?"
I think that Wendy's is taking away market share from McDonald's in the breakfast category. It will show up in the earning results on November 10. This is so undervalued right now.
at bw3 in Fishers/Giest last call at 9:30??? This would be a great place for a sports bar
Stock price has found it's support here in the low 23's. Time for it to rise. Welcome to the next short squeeze!!!
Am I crazy to think margins might actually improve with the reduced workforce at franchises if traffic stays within a 10% reduction from just window service. Just a thought
what manipulationcheck the one year chartopened at 29
Hold it will be over $25 going to $30 in next several weeks. ST profit taking means taxes and missing larger move.
headed to $30 ... breakfast menu looks rock solid .
CEO on Mad Money right now…sounds good
I added under $15.50 this month so I feel like a genius today
"BTIG says Wendy’s will need to capture $1billion in breakfast to break even?? Their 12M revenue is 1.6B. So he thinks breakfast needs to account for 40% of revenue to break even?? I was thinking 20% revenue would be a good target. I’m not a fan of BTIG or many of their calls, so I’m not buying this call."
WEN raised to buy from neutral by Northland Capital/PT raised to $30. Nice.
I just had a Daves double bacon burger for lunch with green iced tea. Still the best burger 
Who's going to get free breakfast tomorrow and Saturday?
EPS beats by 51%!!!
Wendy’s is a Cramer fav $44 
nothing can save this from the incoming market correction.
The current year analyst estimate is 55 cents. .55/17.5 = .0314 about a 3% returnA lot of companies have a 5% return.Dividend is 1.98%. The 10 year rate is 2.741%1.98/2.741 * 17.5 = $12.64MCD has a 2.57% dividend. Based on that WEN is worth $13.62 per share.
I like the stock - WEN MOON
Gonna get this under $23 today!!!
In the short term we could see a squeeze but I think this is a great long term hold either way. Think about where this company could be in the next 10 years if they keep expanding. Easy $10-20bn market cap. I’m just going to keep DCA in to this company each month
MICHAEL IS GETTING SQUEEZED TODAY HAHAHA
Load up at close today for 20% gain tomorrow
Great earnings and bright future! I feel that this will continue to go higher.
"For a change, a beat on both earnings and revenues. Usually it beats on earnings, but falls just short on revenues.Maybe a nice rise today!!"
"Trump - “use drive thru’s”, Pence - “use drive thru’s”. I told you this earlier and yesterday, you should listen more and not panic, use logic, such impulsivity to sell this stock, now you will see the bounce back."
I eat at Wendys several times a month and have a healthy lunch. The locations in NYC are packed and the salads and burgers are delicious.I am thinking of adding to my already profitable position.I also like that Investor Relations at Wendys is always responsive to my questions as a private investor. Thank You Wendys
don't forget free breakfast croissant today and saturday. support WEN!!
Lol some short in this chat keeps downvoting my comments. Can’t wait to prove you wrong
looking good
"Wendy's is the biggest advertiser, running the most commercials during the airing of the show ""Rick and Morty"", an animated scifi show on cartoon network and their most successful show by far. the show is wildly popular with reddit users, meme creators, and millenials/gen Z. New episodes begin to air on Sunday. Does anyone feel there could be a high probability of the Reddit crowd gunning wendy's stock up again? With new episodes airing, after a year and a half, it would seem to be perfect timing to attract attention of wallstreetbets. Agree?"
I have a friend that's a district manager. he says sales are down roughly 25 percent the past month or so. that said I'm still bullish
"After buying some around 27 and adding at 24, I'm thinking what's my next dip target. Wendy's will be just fine going forward. Problem is people want instant gratification. Take a breather and ask yourself why you put money into a stock like this. If it's instant gratification, you might as well sell and look at the next top trending stock. If it's because you like the company, just add on 10-20% dips."
"People need food, fast food restaurants have drive thru’s, the breakfast menu is a huge hit, I see line ups every morning at Wendy’s across where I live, and I see lots of advertisements, this stock is going to get to its projected target of $29, there’s only good news with this stock, and much more to come, earnings report in a few weeks, now is the time to buy, buy now while it’s cheap!"
I bought this at 27.9 have I made a mistake? I'm not that clued up on American stocks but surely wendy's is a recovery stock for 2021?
What company has a director on payroll that dumps $10 million in shares at one time on open market? How did hold as well as it did!
"Last chance to get in below $23.00, you’ve been warned"
3.72%???? I know that wasn’t the pop we’ve been waiting for
Cramer gives strong endorsement of WEN tonight FWIW.
Once Trump signs the stimulus bill and analysts figure out owners of restaurants will qualify for SBA loans its a game changer. Buy any weakness this will recover real fast with dropping beef prices and reduced labor costs .
Great buy- I’m all over anything under $22.61
Expecting a minimum 20-30% run up before next earnings in November. Won’t be long before this is a $30 stock
As expected it’s already up after hours.
"Cramer’s bottom line, “Wendy’s is under-valued.”"
"This stock is hopeless to many paper hands, I’m sticking with AMC"
Buy at this bargain price before ER. It will explode after ER!
If the market crashes demand for fast food will skyrocket. If it doesn’t crash Wendy’s is still a great long term investment. Win win!
"The only quality burger around, the only fast food burger I will eat.............."
"Wendy’s CEO expects to hit 10% digital sales goal in 2021, three years ahead of schedulehttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/wendys-to-hit-10percent-digital-sales-goal-well-ahead-of-schedule-ceo-says.html"
Could go up 1 whole percent today and be exactly where it was two weeks ago! I’m excited 
Just bought in at $22.98 - this could easily be a $40+ stock
This is going above $25 soon.
I think this will pop next Monday or Tuesday. Buy right now or get in at $22.85
The 15th is dividend day !
The only thing holding WEN back is the market. Desperately wants to go higher but can’t get any footing when market is in free fall. Recession equals more people eating fastFood. No more steak and lobster.
After hours this will fly. We’ve shaken off the paper hands
Order in today for $22.50
Great earnings and upped dividend 20%
People are griping about Peltz selling a bunch of shares...but look at how many shares he still holds. So he is selling 5% of his shares. Big whoop is all I can say.
"pls don't hurt McD too much !(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) fell short of Wall Street expectations for quarterly sales at its established U.S. outlets on Tuesday, as it battled intense competition from rival fast food chains and restaurants that offer plant-based options."
Upward
Went shopping today went by 4 Wendy’s all packed….This is a winner.
"Wendy's Northern Indiana Restaurant.Almost Always Packed With Customers. Fast Efficient Friendly Customer Service, And Great Food. I Started Buying Wendy's Stock at $4.50 Per Share And Still Buy When Wendy's Stock Price Falls. I Am Very Happy Owning Wendy's Stock And I Will Continue Purchasing Buying Wendy's Stock."
Stock is trading sideways today it will be interesting to see what it does after lunch.I am always suspect when news to sell comes out the day before earnings.Stay tuned
$WEN Upgraded by Northcoast Research Neutral » Buy USD 30Upgrades Northland Capital Buy USD 30
All upgrades and upward price targets--all that had releases. More meaningful upgrades and upward price objectives over the new few days! Big houses take longer to release reports...
Sadly market has been down since Wendy’s reported earnings. Wait till Monday! 
Killer buy under $22
I bought the stock because I like Wendy’s food the best
They are aggressively expanding in UK and Asia. New locations in nyc as well! Park avenue ＆ 23rd Street is upcoming soon! this cash cow business model is booming! Do we still remember that WEN was about to release their innovative breakfast plan right before Covid-19 breakout last year? Now is the best timing for WEN to shine!
Either way you win. If it dips on earnings buy more or if it goes up on earnings buy more. This is like holding a winning lottery ticket. See ya @$25
This won’t stay under $23 for long.
UP--UP----WEN---Oil is down--Jobs numbers are UP----April 19 - Vac for all-Population wants to go out to eat--Road trips See AMERICA--WEN will do the most UP--stock price--rocket up May---June--UP 30% stay long
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
I heard about WEN the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Pick-stocks.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Could quite easily seeing a squeeze tomorrow as people FOMO in and shorts start covering at $25.
Bought in @ 21.79
"Something big is coming soon, suspiciously low volume."
Upwards only now!
And raised 2021 fullyear guidance EPS $0.79〜$0.81.
Cramer likes Wendy’s
"Buying more, this is too cheap lol"
I am a big WENDYS fan love the food and I can tell you from first hand research take out at franchises are at record levels. The margins will shock analysts the next earnings report less cost associated with just a take out window burger chain. Traffic is at record highs I because people want comfort food and a safe escape to get out of the house while never leaving your car. CDC has also stated there is no danger of getting Covid19 from take out service and employees at Wendys I have visited are all wearing masks and gloves. Give me my Baconator or give me death.
Nelson Peltz is saying good things about WEN now on CNBC Halftime :)
$WEN & $PZZA would have been a great merger. I wonder why it didn’t go through. Wendy’s management would have been great for Papa John’s problems.
They had some interesting insights about WEN on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Can see this squeezing at end of week.
I just waited 9 min on a Wendys drive threw in NJ for my Baconator and line was huge. Awesome stress food
"Picked up a couple hundred today. When there's blood on the streets, you buy."
wen upgraded
Just stay long thats why its called investing.
Wendy’s hasn’t reached its average trading volume the entire month of July... today it almost did! Investors are Buying in
I’m about to be done with it 
Once in a lifetime drop. I was able to get in at 7.43 and will be holding for life.
$25 by Friday close
Another upgrade for Wen. Loop Capital upgrades to buy with price target $31.
Going to keep buying until $25.
Best time to buy
the new fries are a huge improvement. they need to do what BK did in the in the late 90s and offer free fries to everyone for a day.
Just Bought More Wendy's. Early Christmas Present.
I should have bought when this was under 20 / Share in Sept. .. all is well for WEN future
Great company with strong 2020 outlook. Curious to see the impact on breakfast launch since covid scare. Looking for it to retest the lows and that's when I will go long. Good luck!
Bought at $22.61
I’m in at $22.96! Great Cramer stock

I bought Wendy’s when they came out with the Strawberry Summer Chicken Salad a few years ago. Now I’m up 120%. The new Southwest Avocado Duo is going sell like crazy. I’m buying more tomorrow.
WE LIKE THE STOCK. WSB IS CAPABLE OF PUMPING THIS STOCK TO $100
I am holding threw the carnage burgers are a comfort food.. I had a double bacon today it helped ...
Criminals dumping after hours
MMMM Wendy's Stock............it's kool to be Square
I ate Wendy’s for dinner for free today plus a 5 k profit
Share price is consistently rising and falling very little on down days. Won’t be long before we see a 10-20% pop
"Wendys is eating into McDonads marker share even they admit it.Competition in the fast-food industry has been high, as companies like Wendy’s (WEN) announced last month that it would be making yet another attempt to join the select group of fast-food restaurants offering up breakfast. Wendy’s said that it would be hiring an additional 20,000 workers for the early 2020 launch."
"shake Shack loses money, McD loses best ever ceo, Wendy will show great improvement."
"If tomorrow news (Initial Jobless Claims) is positive, trust me this stock will shoot up 8-10%"
Boom  Ride to $30
This stock alway $22 no matter which angle you look at it. Lol
McDonalds a 157 billion market cap . Wendy’s at 4.5 billion. I don’t know about anyone else but if I want a burger Wendy’s is 2x better. I’ll take my chances on Wendy’s making me more money long term
If this falls to $22.00 over next few days expect a pop soon
You’re gonna wake up one day and this stock is going to be over $50.. Amazing buying opportunity right now
What a beautiful stock! This one will kiss $30

Looks like insiders are dumping yuuuge loads on the market.
"Jim Cramer told Real Money readers there are still other bull markets out there including restaurants, where the last men standing are likely to be Wendy's (WEN) , McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) ."
"Goldman Sacs note on Chick-fil-A.taking a bite out of Wendys market share was nothing more than an attempt to lower the price for its clients to buy, The US economy is strong and the Fast Food Sector is one of the best performers This week I was in an airport in Dallas and tried a .Chick-fil-A sandwich for my own research. The chicken sandwich was dry and the waffle fries were soggy and a very small portion at that.,I also noticed people using all kinds of sauces along with the food which tells me the food has no flavor. When I have a Wendys burger or chicken sandwich the flavor is there No Sauces Needed. Todays news about Meritage tells me the chain is strong and growing in key market areas..This month i was also in South Dakota serious beef country and Wendys are everywhere. Speaks Volumes to me. Well you can call me crazy or you can call me wrong but been here since $7."

"Thought of sharing the following article posted on reddit by the writer u/RazKaz-Na, who initiated the WSB's movement to pump $WEN stock. I find the informaiton very useful for those who are diamond hands...Wendys stock, undervalued, quarterly dividend, dividend growth, capital appreciation, international expansion. Stop asking ""When Lambo?"" and get yourself a $WEN LamboDDI was inspired to look into Wendy's stock ($WEN) a few days ago after seeing this post on this sub.Here is a short list of why I think this is a good buy. Q1 earnings showed the beginning of their recovery from pandemic woes. Same store sales up 13% Q1 85% of dining rooms were open, Q2 should be close to 100% open. Q2 2020 was the hardest hit by the pandemic, Q2 2021 should be the time where recovery becomes growth, smashing yoy numbers. Big breakfast push, breakfast was about 3% of same store sales increase in a limited market. Target EOY is 10%. New and international expansion Consensus estimate price is around $27, its already at a discount $150M loaded up and ready for buy backs. Quarterly dividends have already recovered from pandemic slashing and should continue to grow. Very low volume right now. (Avg 3M shares/day) Scarcity: Float of 220M, Insiders own 21%, institutions own 73%. Only 6% or 13M shares available to retail, which sounds bad until you consider the next bullet point. Most memed company on the internet if it gains traction then, frenzy+scarcity+low volume means minimal buys could push the price quickly.My open positions are very bullish and my plan is to accumulate shares up to about $26 before August and ride the wave on the cheap options I already own...."
What a beautiful stock!
Very undervalued should be $30 minimum
Can’t wait to give vile hedge funds a nasty surprise 
Market down today. Bought more Wendy's Stock. I really enjoy the Smokey Bacon Burger at Wendy's.
Why is this stock so weak? It just won't run no matter what they do.
They had some interesting insights about WEN on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Nice upgrade
Opening much higher--good under-priced and popular stock!
This stock will likely creep up 10-15% over the next two weeks... we probably won’t get the big pop we want without a media mention.
Why are Wendy's burgers square?
Would be funny if they kill those 17.50 puts by friday hahaha could see a big squeeze if 15 and 16 break this week.. expiration is Friday let’s do this $clov $wish $wen $afrm $mrna $somo
Buy buy buy
I think Wendy's should bring back the salad bar but only for non-vaxxed.
Ready for the moon ride guys
Don’t sell and pay tax but hold for $30 later this year!
Will add if it hits $21.25
"Incoming squeeze today, buckle up"
"Its really not that bad and EPS for 2018 was raised 04:28 PM EST, 11/06/2018 (MT Newswires) -- Wendy's Company's(WEN) adjusted EPS rose to $0.17 in Q3 from $0.09 a year earlier, exceeding analysts' estimates of $0.15 in a Capital IQ poll.Revenue increased to $400.6 million from $391.3 million a year ago, but still missing the $405.54 million estimate. North America same-restaurant sales dipped 0.2% in the quarter, against 2.0% growth in Q3 last year.For 2018, it now expects adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.58, from $0.55 to $0.57 previously, and north America same-restaurant sales growth of about 1.0%, down from 2.0 to 2.5% in prior guidance.

solid company. solid stock regardless. not losing money and not going away. my team feels that this pick is solid long term and we are adding to our position
Fairly good growth stock here. Look at the 5-year chart not the monthly.
"Getting dumped at the moment, but don’t worry just HODL"
"Buy at close today, should see a pump tomorrow! Dirt cheap"
"Wendy’s earning call is 5/13, analyst says it will have 7% + gains per stock, this will reach its target value of $29 before then, this is a no brainer, buy now and hold, this is a great stock and it’s only going to get better, check the articles."
Out of all the fast food/restaurant/casual restaurant stocks I feel this offers the best long term horizon value. Share price should be higher with overall market near all time highs. I feel Wendys is recession proof. People still need to eat bad economy or good economy. Breakfast menu should add to the bottom line over next 12 to 18 months
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?"
"just purchased, undervalued, fast food isn't going away. Little more volume today, earnings coming"
I loaded up with 20 K of shares. Won't see this price very long.
Best stock ever! WEN
Dividends paid today?
Wow it’s amazing how much hedge funds manipulate stocks after hours. Only buying AMC in future

If you eat one of the breakfast sandwiches this weekend you will be buying stock Monday .
"There isn't a company that I love to own more than Wendy's. I sell covered calls, very little chance of getting filled.I get divided.We eat fast food once a while and it's almost always Wendy's.Established fast food place that I don't see falling out of favor with general public any time soon."
Where's the MeMe?could help to kick WEN to the moon?$220? Do you think possible?
WEN does not have power to go rally.Downward more to the attractive price around $20.0The meme should come back push to $40 as revenge.
I like the stock
Buy! Buy! Buy!
Gonna keep adding on the way down…this is a juggernaut
I think we’ll see a run up to $26 before next earnings
$24 coming 
"Can see slow accumulation. Large block buys but at limit prices. Eventually, impatient sellers will be exhausted and WEN goes much higher."
Reddit buys back in am…
I do free marketing for Wendys because the stock payed for my son collage fund.The breakfast menu looks awesome and will definitely succeed this time. Cant wait to try Maple Bacon Chicken Croissant McDonalds breakfast has no taste except if you drown the pancakes in butter and syrup.Lots of ketchup needed for their other breakfast sandwiches

"$WEN, $BB, $CLOV have been very good to me today!!! I may ordered a Dave's Double burger, get my cholesterol checked & review the results on my blackberry! up 78% & 21%."
"Buy and hold. - The company launched its breakfast menu in March 2020. This follows a two-year preparation period, during which time Wendy's created a differentiated breakfast menu that could increase its market share within the quick service restaurant industry.The business believes there is strong demand among its customers for breakfast items, according to its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter results. Its breakfast products may also increase its appeal to a broader range of consumers.In addition, eating out for breakfast is becoming more popular among U.S. consumers. The average American also reported eating breakfast 361 days per year in 2019, which is an increase on the 350 days per year average from 2010. Wendy's exposure to a growing market could catalyze its financial performance.Restaurant investmentThe business is upgrading the interiors of its restaurants to improve the dining experiences for its customers. For example, 58% of its global restaurants now have the company's new design and layout. It expects this figure to gradually increase in fiscal 2020, which could improve the satisfaction levels of its customers.Additionally, Wendy's is seeking to increase its number of restaurants through lowering their upfront building cost. This may reduce the amount of time it takes for each of the company's restaurants to make a profit and could make it easier for the business to expand its presence into new geographical regions.International growthThe company plans to double its new restaurant openings in international markets in 2020. It will expand its number of restaurants in the UK and has also signed large development agreements in Canada and the Philippines.Wendy's expansion into international markets could help to reduce its reliance on the U.S. economy at a time when competition in the quick service restaurant industry is high. This could lower the company's overall risks and enable it to capitalize on growth trends in multiple countries in upcoming years."
Squeeze soon
Volume is picking up … currently it’s more than daily avg volume
The ground is at $22.4
"I sold all my properties and bought at 29.5, when should I expect to be rich?"
Wendy’s will probably keep trading sideways between $23-24 until September
Wait until $23.20 to load up up again
Just received my dividend  thanks Wendy’s keep the good work.
"This is it. After investing for 11 years this is exactly what I was looking for. Well known safe restaurant, growth, dividend, meme, undervalued world wide business that only value 5b.Start buying yesterday, just more a whole bunch more. All in guys all in. It will be super fun. All in"

Buying now is great as a short term and long term play imo. This stock is going to be my main focus. Hopefully if I make enough I’ll be able to open a Wendy’s in U.K. we’ll thats my dream anyway lol
WOW!!! TIME FOR THE SHORTS TO RUN!!!
"Missed revenue by less than $2 million, beat earnings per share, trying to figure out the drop in share price. Seems like a Market overreaction. At least it makes a good buying opportunity"
I’ve been wanting this stock for a while. I’m also going to try several of the breakfast   items. Been watching since the $5 range. Just didn’t know much about stocks at the time. Pre pandemic times.
Jesus does this stock actually move? Record earnings as well
What a beautiful entry
Please support your local restaurant including Wendy's if you have the means. It's so important in these times to help out where you can.
"Wendy’s is going to surprise us, ZACKS RANK which has a return of 26% with their ZACKS ranking of 1-5. ZAKS has Wendy’s as a #2 BUY."
why would anyone buy stock that its own management are selling off in the millions in fear of something...
"Interesting that WEN only has ~4-5% short interest, yet this spike from yesterday is being attributed to a short squeeze?"
Earnings going to be fantastic
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Wendy""s stock. New High Coming Soon???????????"
Very tempting at this price.. Will wait a day or so
