"SIOX, buying opportunity."
WOW!!! Wendy's is taking off. Volume just doubled in a matter of minutes
Kramer likes Wendys = Strong Sell.
Wendy's is by far the best fast food chain.
Those fries are gonna raise the share price! They are amazing
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Douglas Cott, adding to his position."
Lohr Group increasing their WEN position.
I think that Wendy's is taking away market share from McDonald's in the breakfast category. It will show up in the earning results on November 10. This is so undervalued right now.
Cramer gives strong endorsement of WEN tonight FWIW.
So what happened at 12:30 ET? The new proprietary french fry coating can't be THAT good.
"This stock would double if this company had better training for managers and insist employees be trained through them properly. They should go to the Chick-fil-A academy for fast food management training. First thing, train an employee to greet a customer and make them feel welcome. That has gone away with Wendy's."
Another upgrade for Wen. Loop Capital upgrades to buy with price target $31.
Menu is broad and food excellent.
"Peter Barnard, adding to his position significantly."
Bought in @ 21.79
buy before earnings
"WEN, will begin offering a Ted Cruz, Burger.A single patty topped with cheese is the burger.Cruz, is a big time WEN customer."
"Can see slow accumulation. Large block buys but at limit prices. Eventually, impatient sellers will be exhausted and WEN goes much higher."
Out of all the fast food/restaurant/casual restaurant stocks I feel this offers the best long term horizon value. Share price should be higher with overall market near all time highs. I feel Wendys is recession proof. People still need to eat bad economy or good economy. Breakfast menu should add to the bottom line over next 12 to 18 months
