"If FDA will approve, with Cipla’s agreement, share price will jump to 14-15 range..."
There is no news yet! Don't get played
"Do you really think an offer would be made around 14 if they didn't think an FDA approval wouldn't happen.........It will happen, but with so few shares, who is weak or strong or patient enough to just sit tight...........I mean come on!!!!!!"
"Over the past several months, the Company has communicated with InvaGen relating to InvaGen’s assertions that Material Adverse Effects (as defined in the SPMA) have occurred due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on potential commercialization and projected sales of IV Tramadol. Additionally, in connection with the resubmission of the Company’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) in February 2021, InvaGen communicated to the Company that it believes the proposed label for IV Tramadol would also constitute a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the SPMA) on the purported basis that the proposed label under certain circumstances would make the product commercially unviable. InvaGen has communicated to the Company its desire to consider all options on the proposed merger, including the option to not consummate the merger. Since the Company did not receive FDA approval for IV Tramadol by April 30, 2021, these assertions have no impact as to whether InvaGen is obligated to close the SPMA because, as discussed above, InvaGen no longer has such an obligation. As a result, the possible timing and likelihood of the completion of the merger are uncertain. There can be no assurance that the Merger Transaction will be completed on the expected terms, anticipated schedule, or at all. It is also possible InvaGen could attempt to pursue monetary claims against the Company."
Any reasons to believe that the FDA responce will be different than in September next month??ATXI dropped 57% after FDA responce.Has anything fundamentally changed???https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avenue-therapeutics-sinks-fda-rejects-173541339.html
Thanks for these good discount prices n added more!
If FDA approves the proposed the label change what would be share price while considering the Cipla-Invagen rejection to take the reaming shares at13.94
Why is there no news?
"It's gonna run hard if it gets approved still, tramadol is a big deal. 6 million float. I expect 15$+"
"Decision for first submission by Protalix Bio Therapeutics of PRX–102 decision scheduled yesterday was rejected by FDA, so I am thinking it's positive for Avenue or would have already been rejected, plus being a resubmission all should be good. Hopefully news today :)"
A little activity here kids...............
Excited for Monday.... GLTA

When is approval?
"Is there hope to approve the medicine after the advisory committee meeting ""OND needs additional input from an Advisory Committee in order to reach a decision on the Formal Dispute Resolution Request (“FDRR”), the details of which have previously been disclosed."""
Does anyone know whether it's common for FDA to miss the goal date? Is it a truly indicator that the application can be rejected?
What is happening
Buy out
"When this thing runs, it'll be real hard to stop with the amount of shares there are available to retail!Insiders own 61% Institutions own 16%With 16.7 Million shares outstanding, there are only about 3.85 million for us!"
Hold strong!Big banks and hedge funds targeting biotech.I’ve seen a lot of pharma companies tanking on good news!!!
invagen has a lot to gain by buying up the shares before FDA approval
FDA announcing today?
Just been through this with another stock KMPH. They announced fda approved at 11:45pm ET the date on PDUFA scheduled date. Hold tight￼!!! We will get there!
"All these stocks which recently got FDA CRL are at a 52-week low, except $SESN, is $SESN heading in the same direction as well?$SPPI, $ARDX, $ETON, $PRVB, $PLX, $ORPH, $MDWD, $ITRM, $FGEN, $CRMD, $ATXI, $ATNX, $ACAD"
"I think they are back to the FDA for a second kick at the can, and maybe they will be successful this timeDisc: am long!"
"down over $50K on this dog. Made and unlucky call and got in at about $12, right before it plummeted."
"There is a difference between a postponement and a delay ""FDA was still reviewing IV tramadol NDA and had not provided a decision yet"" So nothing changed as the 12th was only a goal date. All that happened was a badly handled announcement by Fortress Bio followed by misinformation spread on this social media and then of course panic which is what those spreading that misinformation wanted. An own goal for the shareholders. Keeping my shares although some short-term pain, perhaps I need an IV."
Anytime next week. Thanks me later folks! ;-)
Get more before last bell on tommorow ! !It would not be a shock at all if FDA approves pre-market on Monday..
One month delay on approval is a clear indication that FDA asked for more relations (probably through an Information Request) without issuing a DRL or worse a CRL. Such a delay is very unlikely unless both parts want the approval.
Well fellow investors...........This is definitely uncommon and not of the norm
"It seems the FDA is back on track with the calendar and catching up with the backlog, I am sure we will have news soon :) but what a pain in the ...."
"This company has no money, one product in pipeline and that was just rejected again by the FDA. Not good, not good at all. There is nothing left here."
Parent company FBIO announced ER. For IV tramadol they said that at May 1(ending of their fiscal quarter) they didn't received any updates from FDA. Also stated that the agreement with Invagen can be terminated by ATXI at end of October or by Invagen anytime till October(if they won't pay the second stage of deal... $13.92 for the remaining shares)
They have a very good drug - IV tramadol - but they need another phase three trial to get approval. Probably a year or two away before commercialization. Not sure why it would rally today.
Again focus on how many approval's have been made on IV Tramadol around the world for a post op setting and or need.............Do you really think the USA doesn't need nor would approve
@AndyI believe that the delivery system and timing of ATXI will not need any stacking. There will be an ongoing response. Slow release will increase O-DSMT to be metabolised by CYP2D6 enzyme. Also that will decrease chance of serotonine syndrome. Also you can facilitate with non-opioid analgesics.Hope this helped...
We need some news. But frankly I don’t really see the point of FDA to refuse it. Tramadol is way more bioavailable through IV and refuse it just because of the stacking up the doses. This looks like it was orchestrated...
"NDA resubmitted in February as stated here in previous messages. It's clear that will be approved rapidly, that's why they excluded on label the problematic indications of Tramadol that drove to CRL. Now the dance with Cipla-Invagen to reduce the total price paid-last stage of their deal. As estimated few months ago the last price will be around $10.Even if they don't agree Invagen's stake will be bought back by FBIO at a small price."
