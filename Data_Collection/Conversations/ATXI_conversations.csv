fbio. smart guys in room unlashing value for themselves and also the ventures they had some sort of interest in are started nice shotgun approach stock
invagen has a lot to gain by buying up the shares before FDA approval
Isn't this worth $0 now?
I'm in the medical field this med will be a great the price is going to just
what's going on?
Buy buy...
sigh
At anytime pre NDA the company could have requested a meeting with the FDA to get their views. No termi al sterilization validation in Phase III?. They should fire their QA director.
The merger expiration date is April 20th.
There is no news yet! Don't get played
Did I read earlier (days ago) in the forum about some merger news..........
Come on...do the rocket thing.
$5+ nice
"Lets see Peter..........How many shares available, float,etc.........how do you come up with this crash tomorrow like scenario..........."
decision still under review... calm down everyone!
from 4.65 to 4.40 in half a minute. sweet.
FLOAT = 5.55M VOLUME = 4.5M
12$ coming
"If FDA will approve, with Cipla’s agreement, share price will jump to 14-15 range..."
This is crazy
They will get FDA approval and this can jump even higher than 10 due to shorts...
Why is this falling hard now?
Well this sucks.... I wonder how low this is going to go. I still have faith long term.
Wonder who the big player is here? Lol
come on fda
"From the  mouth ""in theory, the potential approval can happen at any time"""
The very low volume is the scary thing about this stock.
They have a very good drug - IV tramadol - but they need another phase three trial to get approval. Probably a year or two away before commercialization. Not sure why it would rally today.
"This is a one drug company. IV Tramadol. It has been used safely in Europe for decades. For some reason not FDA approved in the USAWe now we get it here. Considering the opioid epidemic. This drug will be a great adjunct to post op pain management. So, will it get FDA approved? Seem far more likely that it will than it won’t. So follow the trails, but what you have here is a drug the every doctor already knows the name of. Adoption will be far faster than a “no name” drug. Good luck every one."
"All these stocks which recently got FDA CRL are at a 52-week low, except $SESN, is $SESN heading in the same direction as well?$SPPI, $ARDX, $ETON, $PRVB, $PLX, $ORPH, $MDWD, $ITRM, $FGEN, $CRMD, $ATXI, $ATNX, $ACAD"
A little activity here kids...............
"Very interesting....Ask was just moved up to $4.00 AH and then it was hit by 1000 shares after almost an hour and a half of nothing.Probably nothing, but ill keep my eye on this Monday morningCheersChenzo"

"Wow, 295k boost up to $7.15!!!!"
Thanks for these good discount prices n added more!

"This company has no money, one product in pipeline and that was just rejected again by the FDA. Not good, not good at all. There is nothing left here."
Here we go. Big day today.
What is happening
4 weeks overdue on approval? that's just downright rude.

So how do you address the safety issues mentioned in the FDA letter? A no combination with another drug warning??
Tramadol will be approved this month
"People getting scared, scared money never made no money"
This is crazy. When is approval!!??
What's up besides the share price?
I personally think this is gonna go up today! NASDAQS don't drop over 50% and keep going its gonna recover
Wed is BIG BIG Day!!!!!!!
"Hey I'm predicting May 26, its all good, let's have some fun with it. Plan on making additional purchases. Agree this is the time for an approval but the FDA will be careful."
Going to fly soon
I bot 40 shares at 4.59 yesterday on robinhood. . .why is it saying $5.55 price pre market but I don't see that price anywhere else.
"The pops are covered moments by the shorts and there are very few shares available........Buy the moments or lose out when the BO comes before the expiration date (May/ish) and a BO of 13.41 a share, which may now come sooner........Or actually may be happening behind the curtain.........HMMMMM,LOLOLOLOL"
"I have been watching this for about 2 weeks now. I am not a shareholder so not bashing or pumping. I like the low shares available, and the high insider ownership. Yet, I cannot get over the fact that they only have 4 employees! Can anyone offer me insight here? Thanks in advance."
The type A meeting with FDA it's fixed for December. Read the yestarday FBIO results to see that.
Here we go again. Jump on board
ADMP will run when Sandoz announces salesPlan for the Last TWO FDA Approved drugsEpipen competition but BETTER.Do your own due diligence- take your time and get in between $2.90 and $3.5 Could easily pop to $6.5 and hold at about $4.5.
What is goin on with this
PDUFA date is Saturday and Monday is a federal holiday. Decision on IV tramadol should come through on Tuesday at the latest.
HERE COMES THE BUYERS! FINALLY!!!
Do ATXI have anything in pipline is there anything to cover this stock to go up before newyear
Still no update :-(
Turns green n soaring.......
"It seems that FDA is unclear about what they want in pain meds. Sure they want ""safer, less potent but effective"" but how do you achieve that? Yes there could be instances where IV tramadol is not providing enough pain relief and an additonal opiod is dosed (opiod stacking) with problems occurring if they both finally kick in. The same opiod stacking problem can occur if they start with a low dose of morphine and then have to give another dose or add on fentanyl. Is the answer to start with a more potent opiod? No.My suspcion is that FDA was unsure of under which conditions to approve so they punted with a CRL. Should they approve with a more restrictive patient population (types of surgeries, procedures) or should they add warnings about how to gradually dose other opiods in parallel? It is possible that they were going to give CRL anyway for the inadequate sterilization validation so they now have more time to discuss internally and with Avenue about conditions for approval. They would ask Avenue for more data to help in the decisision (hopefully not new clinical data).A delay but I expect that it will get approved."

Why can’t I own stocks like this
"Tramadol should not be approved.another morphine like drug,a problem in the makeing like teva has with oxycodines"
I became a millionaire today. So grateful
time to sell??
A good day for ATXI up over 5%.I'm still under water but hoping to stay a float.
Unfortunately politics got in the way of approval of a good surgical pain medication used successfully in Europe. The acting commissioner at FDA is under fire for previous role in approving opioid products so FDA will not approve any new opioid products right now regardless of data or safety.
What are your price targets?
Soooooo...PDUFA date? Did it get postponed? It still shows on the calendar
Heron had a similar drug (IV Mobic) just denied........manufacturing issues
"So frustrating, no update from management."
Get ready for the run up. This one is far from over. Short ACRX and go long ATXI.
$15 price target by J.P Morgan
Oh. what happened?
GOOD THING HERE IS 61% OF SHARES OF ATXI ARE HELD BY INSIDERS
Take your profits kidsLeave in 50% gains if you mustONLY SURE WAY to win
"It's gonna run hard if it gets approved still, tramadol is a big deal. 6 million float. I expect 15$+"
Shouldn’t they have already special meeting with FDA around these days?
Thank you atxi... I'm so grateful ... GLTA
fda addef atxi into the ignore list
4 employees really?????
Here we go again. I hope people are paying attention to this stock
why is this down 20% in the last week?
Would be nice to see some news here
We Have Lift-Off
"Do you really think an offer would be made around 14 if they didn't think an FDA approval wouldn't happen.........It will happen, but with so few shares, who is weak or strong or patient enough to just sit tight...........I mean come on!!!!!!"
looks good
$ATXI started to run too!
REJECTED!
Told u guys 10$ coming
Go baby go!!!
What's the next step for them? Is there even a chance?
"This interview with the CEO is a good source of intell:https://www.twst.com/interview/interview-with-the-president-and-ceo-avenue-therapeutics-inc-nasdaqatxi""There is a significant unmet need in the current postoperative pain-management paradigm between IV acetaminophen/NSAIDs — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — for mild to moderate pain and conventional narcotics for more severe pain. We believe IV tramadol is an ideal drug to fill the gap and offers a convenient bridge to oral tramadol, therefore potentially circumventing Schedule II narcotics altogether in the post-surgical setting."""

Could be a good day and with a 5M share float it can make big moves.
FDA announcing today?
"IF IT DOESN'T GO UP TOMORROW IN PRE MARKET, THEN MOST LIKELY WILL DROP MORE"
One month delay on approval is a clear indication that FDA asked for more relations (probably through an Information Request) without issuing a DRL or worse a CRL. Such a delay is very unlikely unless both parts want the approval.
Anyone has an idea about the PR time?
DOING GOOD FOR MARKET BEING DOWN
ACRX is a much better place to put your money folks...
if there is news why is it not public?
long term play ....just need one majic drug .same wirh fbio...will pop..and share revs with ventures it staked
Buy out
I can't believe folks are uneasy because of 65k shares played with during AM.... We Rise today... WE MOVE! Keep the faith!
"Their pipeline is weak. No other product up for FDA approval and now that the FDA has shot this down, this company is done."
What is this? Lmao how is this running but Fbio is stuck
Thanks fda
"down over $50K on this dog. Made and unlucky call and got in at about $12, right before it plummeted."
Is earning morning or aftermarket
Nick. U mean 6
Anyone knows the decision date ? thanks
The company only has 2 employees. That is one way to keep expenses to a minimum.
the insiders buy is interesting. they paid over USD 9.5 per share Last year
Anyone has news???
Excited for Monday.... GLTA
"Over the past several months, the Company has communicated with InvaGen relating to InvaGen’s assertions that Material Adverse Effects (as defined in the SPMA) have occurred due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on potential commercialization and projected sales of IV Tramadol. Additionally, in connection with the resubmission of the Company’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) in February 2021, InvaGen communicated to the Company that it believes the proposed label for IV Tramadol would also constitute a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the SPMA) on the purported basis that the proposed label under certain circumstances would make the product commercially unviable. InvaGen has communicated to the Company its desire to consider all options on the proposed merger, including the option to not consummate the merger. Since the Company did not receive FDA approval for IV Tramadol by April 30, 2021, these assertions have no impact as to whether InvaGen is obligated to close the SPMA because, as discussed above, InvaGen no longer has such an obligation. As a result, the possible timing and likelihood of the completion of the merger are uncertain. There can be no assurance that the Merger Transaction will be completed on the expected terms, anticipated schedule, or at all. It is also possible InvaGen could attempt to pursue monetary claims against the Company."
Again focus on how many approval's have been made on IV Tramadol around the world for a post op setting and or need.............Do you really think the USA doesn't need nor would approve
When is it expected to pass or fail approval by the FDA?
short squeeze hmm hmm?
should i average down or no chance they can recover? im @$4.25/share
"There is a difference between a postponement and a delay ""FDA was still reviewing IV tramadol NDA and had not provided a decision yet"" So nothing changed as the 12th was only a goal date. All that happened was a badly handled announcement by Fortress Bio followed by misinformation spread on this social media and then of course panic which is what those spreading that misinformation wanted. An own goal for the shareholders. Keeping my shares although some short-term pain, perhaps I need an IV."
is this going to hit 5.50 today??
When is Monday coming
"Yeees, I can load up more...please stay under 4 "
Still no update from the company!
"Decision for first submission by Protalix Bio Therapeutics of PRX–102 decision scheduled yesterday was rejected by FDA, so I am thinking it's positive for Avenue or would have already been rejected, plus being a resubmission all should be good. Hopefully news today :)"
Dammm insider trading! They KNEW there was bad news and shorted it before it came out. Short shares went from 33K to 1680K.
With an 1st offer of $6.oo for 5.8 M Shares and second at $13.92 for the remaining 2/3 and with other incentives why is ATXI trading so low?
"Looking to invest in $FBIO or this, which one is better for someone looking to get into this?"
What????? FDA rejected???
"I think they are back to the FDA for a second kick at the can, and maybe they will be successful this timeDisc: am long!"
From ATXI Investor Relations today: FDA is still reviewing the resubmitted NDA. No timetable from them given on when it will be complete.
Anyone??? Anything good?Is this going bust???
"the accumulation is so obvious............The amount outstanding will become so small, it will jump to 10+ on less than 30 min of trading...........tiny orders under 5000+ won't take"
They are merging after approval so what does this mean? still merging right now or later? i didnt put a dime on this one because of the merger and glad i didnt now!!!
Any chance of a rebound???
"I love the lawyers lining up... ""We're investigating ATXI because the FDA hasn't done their job. Sign up here..."" idiots"
Just been through this with another stock KMPH. They announced fda approved at 11:45pm ET the date on PDUFA scheduled date. Hold tight￼!!! We will get there!
8K volume in almost 2 hours...We must be few days away from FDA decision
Can i ask ATXI go up with the momentum of AMC and orher meme stock or because of good news insider guys?
"So Andy.........Learn a little more from the studies............This is not a case of stacking...........Also,it is a case of POST SURGICAL MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!Please people understand that!!!!!!! good gosh!"
When exactly in February is second round of FDA meeting??
ETTX = MCap $69 Million / Cash $50 Million / 2 MEGA Phase 3 Drug readouts starting next Q =1000%++ UPSIDE GEM
"Can someone help answer questions - going through the unaudited statement, liquidity and capital resources raises some flags. So if tramadol gets approved, they need funding to pay out $5M milestone payments, and any debt or equity offering needs to get approved by Invagen who can pretty much dictate the terms? Also, Invagen is not subject to the mandatory closing obligations since they did not receive the response before April 30, so they don't have to purchase the remaining shares for $180M? Am I reading this right?"
Well fellow investors...........This is definitely uncommon and not of the norm
$3.60 breakout coming...
EARS skyrocketing now.. going for high of the day.
2 min to the dumps
Hold strong!Big banks and hedge funds targeting biotech.I’ve seen a lot of pharma companies tanking on good news!!!
"Avenue's Bermuda Triangle, it's been lost in the FDA for a month now :("
The decision could come anytime!
I need 3.99 today
$ATXI was worse :)
If FDA approves the proposed the label change what would be share price while considering the Cipla-Invagen rejection to take the reaming shares at13.94
Parent company FBIO announced ER. For IV tramadol they said that at May 1(ending of their fiscal quarter) they didn't received any updates from FDA. Also stated that the agreement with Invagen can be terminated by ATXI at end of October or by Invagen anytime till October(if they won't pay the second stage of deal... $13.92 for the remaining shares)
After the bell today...............be ready and watch volume 30min before close
I sold at $8. GLTA that are still in! Hopefully they get approved
"Wow, I was thinking that I took at the bottomAnother thing I will need to avg down"
FDA is joking? Don’t tell me that they didn’t have enough time to go through it...
this is a steal. i’ve been in this for a few years for the shaft 8 months ago. was at 11-12. it is gonna zoom right bank to those numbers. what a blessing this is
anyone else watching for a price correction
"Why this IPO keep down since starting, some problem?"
"It seems the FDA is back on track with the calendar and catching up with the backlog, I am sure we will have news soon :) but what a pain in the ...."
See you guys at the bottom around $1.20
"When this thing runs, it'll be real hard to stop with the amount of shares there are available to retail!Insiders own 61% Institutions own 16%With 16.7 Million shares outstanding, there are only about 3.85 million for us!"
"Slowly reaching to zero, the management has not been given any further information about their next step after the FDA dismissal. They should give some explanation to investors"
"If it is CRL why not say it, I think the odds are better now with the delay"
reaching 5
When?!
Not many if any comments on this stock. But please keep a eye on it. A very close eye. This can be a home run
Get more before last bell on tommorow ! !It would not be a shock at all if FDA approves pre-market on Monday..
why did it Jump
no ptoblem got it greg was suppose to pick me up at 11ish no greg yet if he shows at mikes ii drive self
buy ACRX up 65% since Wed
Ut ooooooooooooh
https://twitter.com/deitaone/status/1315601559506636808?s=21
no news?
"If you read the CRL, Stacking opioids is the issue, has nothing to do with sterilization. That’s a simple minor thing that is easily fixed along with labeling. But stacking opioids is the problem. Have they addressed this?"
1.5M SHARES SHORTED
@AndyI believe that the delivery system and timing of ATXI will not need any stacking. There will be an ongoing response. Slow release will increase O-DSMT to be metabolised by CYP2D6 enzyme. Also that will decrease chance of serotonine syndrome. Also you can facilitate with non-opioid analgesics.Hope this helped...
looky here......... up 7% today. New FDA news?
When is approval?
We need some news. But frankly I don’t really see the point of FDA to refuse it. Tramadol is way more bioavailable through IV and refuse it just because of the stacking up the doses. This looks like it was orchestrated...
Any reasons to believe that the FDA responce will be different than in September next month??ATXI dropped 57% after FDA responce.Has anything fundamentally changed???https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avenue-therapeutics-sinks-fda-rejects-173541339.html
Why is there no news?
Not an opioid
Does anyone know whether it's common for FDA to miss the goal date? Is it a truly indicator that the application can be rejected?
AFTER THE BELL
Anytime next week. Thanks me later folks! ;-)
"right now invagen owns 33% and fbio owns 20%, invagen could have purchased 20% on the market and they would stock holder rights, but fbio still has contractual rights"
what's happening? it was +20%
"NDA resubmitted in February as stated here in previous messages. It's clear that will be approved rapidly, that's why they excluded on label the problematic indications of Tramadol that drove to CRL. Now the dance with Cipla-Invagen to reduce the total price paid-last stage of their deal. As estimated few months ago the last price will be around $10.Even if they don't agree Invagen's stake will be bought back by FBIO at a small price."
Should approve by eow
