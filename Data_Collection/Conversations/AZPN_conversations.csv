AZPN is up 5.24% to 90.00
"Getting hammered today due to earnings miss and lower forward guidance, mainly due to the refining vertical that’s been severely affected by the macroeconomic environment. Refineries have tight budgets for 2021, so Aspen hasn’t been able to close new deals at the expected pace.I’m still bullish on the stock and may add more today on the dip. Aspen has 95% renewal rates and 19 of the 20 largest refineries, engineering companies, construction companies, and chemical manufacturers all use Aspen. In refineries in particular where margins are razor thin, their software can save them millions. Switching costs give Aspen a huge economic moat, since the risk of changing software is huge. Even so, Aspen still invests heavily in R&D to continually improve process engineering (14-16% vs. industry average of less than 5%). They won’t be losing market share any time soon - long term hold for me."
Great transaction. The CC is well worth a listen. Neat structure to the transaction in that the float will shrink for the new AZPN even as revenue grows due to folding in the EMR business. I believe that will drive per share value higher due to scarcity value of the new shares.
"Honeywell mentioned as another possible suitor for AZPN, per Barron's."
bought at 68 wondering if its time to sell
"At the present price, the $200 million buyback equates to ~2.1% of the fully diluted outstanding share count. With a forward P/E of only 25x, compared to its excellent growth rate, the company is a rare value in today's market. AZPN is a BUY and I have a $160 PT, or about ~15% above today's price. At $160, and based on the midpoint of EPS guidance ($5.43/share), the P/E would still be less than 30x, not at all extreme for a company that just showed quarterly revenue up 85% yoy and net income that rose over 200% yoy."

Like the earnings traction... great Q4. Would like to see management clean up the balance sheet.
"The quarter was huge and beat analyst's est. by .38 along with crushing analyst's Rev est by $24.24M And now both their full-year EPS and Revenue Guidance is even more impressive. Before this quarter the analyst's EPS est was $3.35 FY and now it's $4.78-$5.35. Revenues for FY have jumped from the original $565M, and now are $704M- $754M. You don't need a masters in math to know that this is huge for AZPN. Read the earnings yourself. Only the naive or foolish sell here!!"
"Great earnings, very bright future, great forward guidance! Great opportunity here!"
Bidding war for AZPN! Could go to $1000 per share!!
