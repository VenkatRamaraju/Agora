"AZPN guide up for the remaining second half of the FY not good enough for you institutional investors? What do you expect in the current situation? Sheesh talk about a picky bunch.@@@We expect GAAP operating income in the range of $201 million to $206 million, net income in the range of $127 million to $131 million, and GAAP EPS of a $1.63 to a $1.67 per share. This compares to our previous guidance of GAAP operating income of $199 million to $206 million, net income of $126 million to $131 million and GAAP EPS of $1.58 to $1.64 per share. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $218 million $224 million, which is up from our previous guidance of $217 million to $224 million for the full year fiscal 2017. This will be to non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of a $1.79 to $1.83 which is an increase from our previous of $1.73 to $1.78 per share for this fiscal year. With respect to annual spend, we are maintaining our guidance of 3% to 6% annual spend growth in fiscal 2017. Looking at cash flow, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to a $165 million to $170 million for the year, from our previous guidance of $160 million to $165 million. From a timing perspective we continue to expect to pay the remaining 50% of our cash taxes equally in the third and fourth quarters."
"I shorted 33,000 AZPN shares at average price of $61.33 when it was trading above $60/share recently.AZPN price is way too high.If anyone bought AZPN shares recently they need to call 800-GAMBLER for immediate help.Looks as if the only one posting on the Yahoo conversation chat board is love_azpn using his multitude Yahoo id's."

"The quarter was huge and beat analyst's est. by .38 along with crushing analyst's Rev est by $24.24M And now both their full-year EPS and Revenue Guidance is even more impressive. Before this quarter the analyst's EPS est was $3.35 FY and now it's $4.78-$5.35. Revenues for FY have jumped from the original $565M, and now are $704M- $754M. You don't need a masters in math to know that this is huge for AZPN. Read the earnings yourself. Only the naive or foolish sell here!!"
"So if you take out the one time tax refund the net results are really not that great - conference call was disaster with a high-pitched screeching noise canceling out most of the talk - all I could hear was a continuous reference to a ""new normal"" having to be accepted which didn't sound so good - anybody catch with a whole new normal thing was about?"

$AZPN Downgraded by Benchmark Buy » Hold Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 150 » USD 155 Downgrades JPMorgan Chase Underweight USD 156 » USD 144 Reiterated by William Blair Buy
"At the present price, the $200 million buyback equates to ~2.1% of the fully diluted outstanding share count. With a forward P/E of only 25x, compared to its excellent growth rate, the company is a rare value in today's market. AZPN is a BUY and I have a $160 PT, or about ~15% above today's price. At $160, and based on the midpoint of EPS guidance ($5.43/share), the P/E would still be less than 30x, not at all extreme for a company that just showed quarterly revenue up 85% yoy and net income that rose over 200% yoy."

"It's all in the details. There's a good reason behind the current FY2017 guidance - which you'll notice they are maintaining at targets first issued in June. Overall a decent quarter in the current circumstances of low oil prices.@Our fourth quarter performance was achieved despite the fact that the three Latin American NOC transactions referenced on prior earnings calls did not renew. The macro environment in certain countries in this region remains challenging. And while we continue actively engage with these customers, the timing for any of these transactions to close is unclear at this time. We do not intend to provide further progress updates on these transactions going forward, but we will inform investors, if any of these transactions closes... Karl will review our overall guidance later, but I wanted to take a moment to discuss our annual spend outlook for fiscal year 2017. We're reiterating our target of 3% to 6% growth in annual spend. This outlook assumes no impact from the Latin American NOC transactions that has not renewed and no improvement in the demand environment we experienced in fiscal year 2016.@I'd now like to close with our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2017. We are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance that we initially provided at our Investor Day this past June. We continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $470 million to $477 million. Taken together, we continue to target GAAP operating income in the range of $199 million to $206 million for fiscal 2017, with GAAP net income of approximately $126 million to $131 million. We expect GAAP net income per share of $1.56 to $1.62. From a non-GAAP perspective, we are reiterating our non-GAAP operating income guidance of $217 million to $224 million, and expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $1.71 to $1.76."

We’re for sure in a downswing… Cash running low and initializations numbers have been dropping which hamper future growth. If the backlog really and truly is there I’m not concerned… Management have a lot to prove once restrictions lift as were all sick and tired of hearing the same story over and over each call.Tough pill to swallow today but I’m remaining patient as the business model is structured so well to support future ongoing operations (Zero attrition and growing NDR) and growth (With 100k+ connected assets) and the story behind the software and how it helps business’ is too compelling to back out now (Read Digital Transformation by Thomas Siebel).Comparables like $AZPN and $AI are much more established. Remain patient.I’ve been holding for over a year now.

"Getting hammered today due to earnings miss and lower forward guidance, mainly due to the refining vertical that’s been severely affected by the macroeconomic environment. Refineries have tight budgets for 2021, so Aspen hasn’t been able to close new deals at the expected pace.I’m still bullish on the stock and may add more today on the dip. Aspen has 95% renewal rates and 19 of the 20 largest refineries, engineering companies, construction companies, and chemical manufacturers all use Aspen. In refineries in particular where margins are razor thin, their software can save them millions. Switching costs give Aspen a huge economic moat, since the risk of changing software is huge. Even so, Aspen still invests heavily in R&D to continually improve process engineering (14-16% vs. industry average of less than 5%). They won’t be losing market share any time soon - long term hold for me."
