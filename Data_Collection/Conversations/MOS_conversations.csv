.28 a year hardly worth it
"Currently listening to the Mosaic ""Fireside Chat/Earnings Call"" and not hearing anything management is saying to help lift the current stock price. Guess the analysts will decide how to adjust their expectations for future quarters that will probably pressure the stock price and prevent shareholders from seeing $40 as others were predicting after the earnings call. I previously replied to a recent post who was asking if they should buy before the earnings and I suggested if they felt comfortable to add at $35, consider buying only 1/3 of the number of shares they wanted to add, then wait after earnings if the price drops to find another entry point once the stock had found a bottom to add perhaps another 1/3 of the position. At this point, it might be good to wait to make the last 1/3 of the position to see a re-test of todays (5/4) low of $32.45 and wait for the adjustments of analyst expectations going forward for the next few quarters."
"The Tampa retention pond is totally irrelevant to this stock. The three big things to keep an eye on will be 1) ER on May 3rd 2) USDA chemical usage report on May 14 3) USDA crop progress report first week of June. Those are the big catalysts coming up. Sont expect much until those reports are out. In the background will be corn futures...if they rally hard (and they just went ""limit up"" a couple days ago), then MOS will climb. There is definitely positive anticipation for this stock, need some macro report fundamentals to make it move."
"Commodities | On the MoveMosaic downgraded at J.P. Morgan on weaker 2019 phosphate outlook.December 12, 2018, price target $33."
Q1 sales increase 30%...and the big surge in Spring planting season wasn't even included in Q1. What's that tell you?
"Farmers should be planting record acreage this year. Farmers should be pulling out all the stops to maximize production this year to to high prices. Farmers should be using a lot of fertilizer and be willing to pay up for it this year. MOS could double in price from here by August(that would be $66). Just my opinions, but then I have a bias due to my holdings of Sept $50 call options."
Fertilizer is very expensive.MOS should move higher sort-term
Fertilizer prices show no signs of pulling back. Potash jumped nearly 20% in the last month alone.https://agfax.com/2021/07/29/dtn-fertilizer-trends-potash-climb-continues-uan-down-slightly/Just a few thoughts. Shutting down K1K2 potash mines is an issue for this quarter. Fortunately it came late in the quarter and the sales impact should be minimal for the quarter. Looming is how much of the shut down cost they will write off for the quarter. Regardless the CEO has to spin that K3 will be coming up to full capacity over the coming months. Between MOS and the Belarus issue global potash supplies have tightened and prices are soaring. If you consider 2 million tons of Potash and 2 million phosphates for the quarter with a conservative $50 per ton increase over last quarter you come up with about $0.5 per share additionally from last quarter. This does not include the mystery of the Fertilizantes division. Bottom line this quarter will be a #$%$ shoot but the guidance and forward outlook should be very promising. Short term options may be at risk but stock and longer term options should be profitable. Still believe $50 by year end!!
"I like MOS because of the Phos.... 75% of the worlds reserves reside in the western sierra desert, Morroco. The USA has about 6% of the world supply and most of that is controlled by Mosaic .... Demand is up with record grain prices and as a former crop farmer I know the value add from sufficient fertilizer application. MOS has already pre-announced some of the effects pricing is having on results . Steady march up has just begun. Long shares and May $32 calls .... Good luck all"
MOS reached a 52 Week high at 42.65
lost 40% of my stock value so far. I just want to break even and get out.
"TAMPA, FL / ACCESSWIRE / July 7, 2021 / The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) plans to release 2021 second quarter earnings results on Monday, August 2, 2021"
"Coming back now, the weak hands are out. Guidance was great."
Will we get a nice market reaction on the repurchase?
Goes over $40 at 4:30 today. Grain prices are surging again today. Fertilizer will continue to increase as farmers put down all they can get to maximize yields.
"What is the all time record high for corn? We have to be closing in on it. $8 is almost here. Unheard of.Every available acre that farmers can put into corn, will be put into corn and they will pay up for fertilizer.Could be start of multi year cycle of high ag prices. Again, MOS is a great inflation play. I still see it as a possible double from here by year end($70 target). Just my opinions."
what is going on with MOS? Red for the past few days while the general market is up...anyone have any idea?
I have two straws I can grasp at this point. First one is that Credit Suisse has a large position and needs liquidity. Second is that acres planted in the South West and California are less than expected due to the drought. If $MOS jumps next week into OpEx then we will know this was a options short.
The bleeding continued today but at a slower pace & volume was almost double average. I'm not sure what analysts will determine is fair value at this point.
Food prices at decade highs
PE value of 8.36….EPS 3.69…..nuff said….it’s worth a buy on a dip like this.
"Though there clearly isn't a direct tie here, I'm apt to believe the information in the following article bodes well for continued strength in fertilizer prices through at least the 1st quarter next year: https://www.agweb.com/news/machinery/used-machinery/machinery-pete-prices-planting-equipment-soar?mkt_tok=ODQzLVlHQi03OTMAAAF_3HkYTvzd1FBcsCZQXvkVlcDobq8unBHsBZn8SFSgN8MdUa782ntwIyjAWRwzq0rP0ikZWwxkJCD6VtEG1q3F1dKzBPzge263FWBDADrCN-uV30w"
"In case you missed the Feb sales and revenue update here is the highlight The Phosphates segment recorded sales volume of 614,000 tons, up from 532,000 tons last year. The sales revenues for this segment were $297 million, up around 73%.Keep buying the stock IMO"
For the third day in a row over 1 million shares traded right after the close. The price spiked up to 31.75 and then fell back off. ￼ I saw this in August/September 2019 and it turned out they were repurchasing shares. No announcement was made until they had 3/4 of the approved amount bought. .￼2.059MM shares traded as of today’s close 3.38MM 10 minutes later. Once the announcement was made the last time the stock made a 20-30% run up. Let’s hope it happens again.￼
Another 1.5MM shares traded just after the close today. If they spend the entire $1 billion they will buy back around 30MM shares.
Potash is exploding and the mine will be coming online again/very soon. The regain in capacity with soaring prices should make MOS and easy double play within 6 month.
Either the company is buying shares much higher than they should trying to stabilize the price or this is in play.
if we are red because of inflation--why are we going up!?! lol
I reiterate my belief that a share buyback program should be considered. I do not believe an increase of the dividend is the way to go. MOS is down 20% from it's recent highs ... it's the right time for management to pull the trigger!
Mosaic (NYSE:MOS): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.29 misses by $0.24; GAAP EPS of -$2.43.Revenue of $2.08B (-17.5% Y/Y) beats by $150M.
"Lots of overhead resistance at close to the $34 mark. Once it breaks out of that, it could be blue skies breakout."
With Corn and Soybeans in great demand . IPI and all fertilizer companies will enjoy a strong year and increased sales prices .Corn  at $5.77/bu.Soybeans at+ $14.00/ bu.IPI at a bargain at under $30/share !!!!! Buy ! Buy! Buy!

"I am actually starting to think MOS could go north of $100, 12 months out.....Just my opinion."
Why is it dropping ?
Cowen analyst Charles Neivert lowered the price target on Mosaic (NYSE: MOS) to $42.00 (from $43.00) while maintaining a Outperform rating on model update.
Just a heads up for interested investors. The last time mosaic cut future sales forecast multiple times was in 2016 - 2017 and the stock bottomed at $19.39 invest wisely !
"Should be a good summer for Ag stocks. $MOS might trade at $150 like it did in June 2008. All the conditions are similar, or even better than 2008. Besides the inflation factor, Covid created food shortages due to lack of labor in the fields, global shortages due to supply chain issues, etc. China is aggressively purchasing our corn due to uncertainty."
Tomorrow will be an interesting day with the USDA acreage report coming out. Even a modest increase in acreage under cultivation will help reduce the volatility of this stock and it may start forming a base or move higher.
"this is concerning....""Capital expenditures totaled $314 million in the quarter. Mosaic’s total cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, were $385 million compared with $848 million a quarter ago, largely due to the exacerbated seasonal increase in inventories. Long-term debt was $4.6 billion as of March 31, 2019."
"I am still holding Mosaic. Phosphate price is still going up furthermore the freight also rises in price. It means the foreign phosphate price would be high so that it could boost up the phosphate domestic price. Potash price is going up. I think the price has past the bottom. Globally, there is a shortage of phosphate so the price keeps increasing. I believe it is worthy being a stockholder still."
"The US DAP February spot price was just released. 529$ up from 421$. An incredible 26% up, with spring season to come! Its a 50$ dollar stock easy now minimum."
"Seems like a huge position in the June calls. 90,000 open interest in the $40 strike. Since most options expire worthless I'm thinking this never hits it unless all the sudden we go into a drought. Is that $40 strike bullish or bearish and I wonder when it was purchased, the largest blocks?? Any thoughts here? Bullish or bearish? I'm long mos stock, but I've seen those positions go both ways, large put positions as bullish and large call positions bearish or just selling volatility."
"Do we reach $40 by EOD this Friday(6/4). I still believe this stock should/could double or come close to it by late fall ($65-$70). One has to realize this stock is an inflation play. We appear to be moving into a multi year grain bull market. Corn, beans could be moving to a new higher price plateau. I could envision corn hitting $10 a bushel this year and beans maybe even nearing $30. On its face those may sound like ridiculous price targets. Of course no one thought lumber would run from $500 to $1700 per thousand board feet either. Time will tell, sit back and enjoy the show! Just my opinions, I may actually have no idea what I am talking about!"
Bank of America research indicates that this is the start of a very positive Ag Cycle that should last for several years .Short South American crop and high demand from China . North America needs a record crop !Good for all fertilizer stocks and MOS . This is only the beginning of a Strong Ag Cycle.MOS to double from here !!’
What was the $77 million item that impacted earnings negatively? Thanks. Couldn't find reference to it when I scanned the release.
Will move over $34 today and then up up up. Market conditions are set for a double this year.
"This stock is moving up on expectations that the Chinese will resume buying farm products, which will improve future earnings. Need to forget the past."
"the market doesn't understand that this is one of the best inflation plays there is, yet."
"I think MOS is starting to pop up on the ""radar"" now. Some remember its last monster run to well over $100 a share. History could repeat, at least that is what I am thinking."
Absolutely crushed earnings! This should happen 5-10% tomorrow
the DOC decision was already priced in to the euphoric rise in the price of MOS. Does anybody see any more upside or will it slide on the dull and disappointing earnings report on February 16?
Long term I’m still bullish on MOS. They have recently come up short on YOY volumes in all three sectors. This morning’s announcement about further shortfall in LA due to hurricane Ida is not going to help. Saving grace is fertilizer prices which are keeping revenues high I’m on the sideline now. Probably get back in Oct-Nov. GLTA
"Having your mine flood out isn't very strategic, losing your lowest cost production and saying not a big deal is a dream. Colonsay was closed, the union there is the obstacle and why they quit investing there. They will scramble to get K3 running sooner but this will be a hit. They are fortunate that the cyclical earnings from phosphates will certainly help. They might make a deal for Nutrien to fullfill some of their requirements. One other negative is the stronger Canadian dollar, ups all of their labour and material costs."
Same idea as before. Just hope that the gov declare the import duties on phosphate asap. It ll trigger to find the fair value. Potash market is struggling from over supply and I believe that it is passing the bottom. So what left to us is going up.
The stock market has gotten way ahead of companies fundamental values. A correction of at least 10% or more is warranted. Mosaic will get caught up in the downdraft because of the 1.4 beta it carries. I believe it will create the last best chance to buy it on the cheap and that will be the start of a meaningful rebound. Timing is everything and it should coincide with the new US planting season. Grain commodity prices have recovered substantially since the phase 1 agreement was announced with China.
￼ ￼Grain prices pulled back hard recently but have been on a steady rise for the last week. Still higher than the last 8 years. The dollar is weaker but not significantly. The bigger deal here is that phosphate and potash prices are up 50-70% since late fall and show no signs of pulling back. Prior the current pricing DAP has only closed above $500 three other times in history and it’s currently at $690/ton. I think the current stock price is classic big money manipulation to accumulate at a lower price. Earnings over the next two-three quarters will validate this and push the stock much higher. IMHO. Target $50 EOY.
13 years ago this coming June MOS peaked at $145. Could history repeat? Probably not but I could see $100 in the realm of possibilities this year. Just my opinion.
NEVER BUY 6 months peak
"Buying more MOS before the USDA Acreage Report on March 31st. We could see 10 million more acres of corn and soybeans vs. last year. That's a lot of P & K! Also, according to DTN, DAP and MAP prices are 51%-60% higher than last year and Potash is up 15%."
Did you guys notice the roughly 3 million share trade just after the market closed yesterday? Big after hours trade historically have resulted a favorable direction for MOS.
I think they are buying shares back. Two days in a row big volume right after the market closed with very little price movement.￼
Well we started in on planting corn and beans yesterday in NE WI. Only 5500 acres left to go haha.
MOS should be $70 today! This is a gift! 5/3 is earnings release. Get ready!
"I got the jackpot trading all agricultural, Lumber is trading like Bitcoin"
im trying to find relation between phosphate and the demand on lithium iron phosphate batteryif there is any relations maybe we going to see 2008 stock price
"CF is taking off, NTR is seeing some positive action. Looks like Mos just put a bottom and now it is trying to work some kind of a base. Still too early to tell if it is real or not. Good Luck."
it's overvalued still for the short term but intermediate term (3 months) should end at at least $55....I'll be adding MORE on any short term drops.
"Based on Bunge earnings today, I see clear path for MOS to 80"
"@Samantha ... I sold yesterday & was a long term holder since 2015. All during that time I was either bullish or neutral, even when the stock went below $10 per share in March 2020 during the pandemic. Since the announcement of the K1 & K2 shutdown and push to open the K3 months away, I anticipated a possible pullback to $34.50 per my post a week ago. For a few days, I watched the stock and thought it was going to hold that support but I was wrong. After I sold yesterday afternoon, I saw your post about the May numbers release. Obviously the numbers did not instill investor confidence based on todays price action. Now that it broke below what I believed was support, I hope to re-enter the stock but want to see support. If the stock reaches this point, I believe MOS management should consider a share buyback program which would show confidence until the next quarterly earnings release and opening of the K3."
Thank god for great margins and pricing power as management can’t capitalize on the volume opportunities in the coming quarter We can only hope for a super cycle in pricing to allow the Gang of misfits to fully realize profit potential by getting mining volumes back to higher levelsI still think we should be back at 35 despite management
"stock breaks $35 very quickly, eps and forward statement tues. buy ing all I can"
"It seems everything is down based on covid related lockdown themes in Europe. What on earth would that have to do with a fertilizer company? Even covid here for that matter. It don’t matter how bad covid gets here a crop will be planted. I am a private consulting field agronomist. Mosaic products are premiumProducts that sell a a bit of a premium to the market. I can assure with current corn, soybean, rice prices. There will be no scrimping on crop inputs. Conotrary to popular belief. Farmers generally make more money when the dollars is weak and commodity prices are high. ( high oil$ . It has been painful to watch the decline here but I’ve been adding shares all day long."
"K1 & K2 shutdown is not horrible. They will make up the lost production on increased margin for tonnage prices. I wonder if they accelerated the scheduled closures of K1&K2 (9 months early) as a strategic move. Those closures represent a 2-3% elimination of global supply. In a market that is experiencing vast resource scarcity, this only tightens supply; in turn moving up prices. So $MOS eliminates millions of dollars in annual brine removal expenses and captures higher prices for potash. Seems to be a pretty ok situation IMO. Plus they can now move their labor force earlier to a much more productive vein (K3 shaft). Getting a 9month jumpstart on production capacity increases for 2022."
"The Markets Can Remain Irrational Longer Than You Can Remain Solvent!Hedge fund Appaloosa Buys an additional million+ shares, Grains and fertilizer prices continue to climb, revenues up big YOY, single digit P/E. In my opinion this is classic big money driving and holding the price down to continue to accumulate.￼"
"TAMPA, FL, May 3, 2021 - The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS), reported net income of $157 million, or $0.41 per share,for the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS(1) was $0.57 and adjusted EBITDA(1) was $560 million. Gross margin was $435million compared to $41 million a year ago, reflecting improved per tonne margins in all three operating segments as aresult of higher phosphates prices, higher potash volumes and transformation benefits. Reported earnings werenegatively impacted by notable items of $77 million.“Mosaic delivered excellent earnings for the first quarter of 2021, and our outlook for the year remains favorable,” said JocO’Rourke, President and CEO. “We are demonstrating the earnings power resulting from the combination of our longterm cost structure improvements and strong global fertilizer markets.”Highlights:• First quarter revenues were up 28 percent year-over-year to $2.3 billion, as the company capitalized on strongermarket conditions.• Gross margins in the quarter were up almost 10-fold from the prior year period, primarily as a result of year-overyear price increases. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 19 percent, up from 2 percent in first quarter of2020, and the highest gross margin rate since the second quarter of 2015.• Mosaic's balance sheet continued to strengthen. Unrestricted cash totaled $692 million as of March 31. Thecompany generated $319 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $289million in the quarter, and net debt ended the quarter at $3.8 billion, down $700 million from the year ago period.• Phosphates sales volumes were up 7 percent year-over-year to 2.1 million tonnes. Production volumes were 1.9million tonnes, reflecting turnaround activity in the quarter. Due to ongoing strong demand, inventories remainwell below historical levels, and as a result, sales are expected to be constrained to production volumes in thesecond quarter. Higher input costs were more than offset by improved pricing, and lower cash conversion costs,which resulted in gross margin per tonne increasing to $84 per tonne, up from last year's loss of $43 per tonne."
"USDA acreage report comes in with lower estimates of acres to be planted than was expected(remember this is a government estimate). Beans and corn respond by closing ""limit up"". Farmers will be planting fence row to fence row in my opinion regardless of what the new USDA report estimates. I expect MOS to do really well.Just my opinions."
"Do listen to the Monday June 7 fireside chat and listen to their numbers.MOS targets to sell 9 mil ton of potash in 2021, the K1 K2 closure reduces output by 1 million tons. Because they represent about 14% of global supply of potash, this 1 million tons shortfall or 1.5% of global supply, has boosted asking price by $100 per ton in the mkt as of this week. This means an additional $800 million is sales from the 8 million tons of production!So they are making up way more in sales revenues than due to loss of the 1 million volume.And it saves brine costs by $40-50 mil 2nd half of 2021.They said that they have ran this scenario for K1 and K2 closure for many years, guess why they held off on pulling the trigger? Because potash prices were weak for the past decade. The was no way to make up for the loss sales as there was no pricing power in the market.This is the opportunity to get off the old mine and switch to a more efficient mine without losing revenue in the mid stream and offsetting the increased capital spending with the increase in revenues.I think they are still on track to double EPS from the $1.74 of 2020 to over $3 for 2021. At constant PE, that would likely see double of share price by next year this time. Do your DD and check what the future holds."
This is sad for a $48 stock that had great earnings would drop to $21 bucks...
"With BHP yesterday committing to the Jansen mine, the long..... term pricing of potash is a little more murky now. Plus other new supply per article. Knee jerk reaction for many traders is to sell first and analyze later.BHP isn’t the only miner moving into fertilizers -- Anglo American Plc took over a $4 billion U.K. mine in 2020 as it shifts from coal to more environmentally-friendly commodities.There are other big projects in the works. Russia’s Acron Group is speeding up construction of Talitsky potash mine and targets the first supplies in 2025. In Belarus, Slavkali plans to start a 2 million tons-a-year mine in 2023.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vital-fertilizer-inspiring-multibillion-dollar-135541973.html"
"I am new to this company .I believe the stock will double by Sept.2021 .Can anyone explain what delay is canpotex and how does affect the company ,also is this a temporary items or a permanent one .has anything to do with any government or is a business item .Thanks"
"MOS reported net income of $437 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS(1) was $1.17 and adjusted EBITDA(1) was $829 million. Gross margin was $752 million compared to $257 million a year ago, reflecting improved per tonne margins in all three operatingsegments as a result of higher prices and transformation benefits, partially offset by lower volumes. Reported earnings were negatively impacted by notable items of $27 million.“Mosaic's results for the second quarter of 2021 highlight the benefits of our transformation efforts in a strong pricing environment,” said Joc O’Rourke, President and CEO. “Underlying agricultural markets remain constructive, and this is driving demand for fertilizer. The second half of 2021 is expected to be one of our strongest periods in more than a decade.”Highlights:• Second quarter revenues were up 37 percent year-over-year to $2.8 billion, as stronger pricing more than offset lower volumes.• Gross margins in the quarter were up 193 percent from the prior year period, primarily as a result of year-overyear price increases. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 26.9 percent, up from 12.6 percent in second quarter of 2020 and the highest gross margin rate since the first quarter of 2013.• The company generated $1.0 billion in cash flow from operations during the quarter, or $718 million aftersubtracting capital expenditures.• Third quarter phosphate and potash segment sales are approximately 90 percent committed and priced.◦ Phosphate average realized prices in the third quarter are expected to be $90 to $100 per tonne higherthan prices realized during the second quarter. Raw material costs in the third quarter are expected toincrease $15 to $25 per finished tonne above second quarter costs."
"Treasury imposed sanctions on Belarus today, fert and potash. Huge for MOS when news gets out..."
Looks like MOS is about to surge violently upwards. Big quarter results followed by analyst upgrades.
"food prices are rising faster than inflation, agriculture will buy way more fertilizer this year to get a higher throughput"
"Corn and beans up strong today! MOS is a commodity inflation play, eventually the market will figure it out. My ""out on a limb"" prediction is MOS will earn close to $5 per share this year, end the year at a 18 PE ratio and close at $90. Just my opinion."
"Well everyone, get ready for blowout earnings and SP north of 50 next week."
Options predicting 7% movement on earnings tomorrow. Odds are favoring MOS at $34.50 come Tuesday morning.
"The largest negative impact on earnings in Q1 was the unhedged foreign exchange exposure that was realized due to the stronger dollar in Q1. This is temporary and in fact, most currency forecasts predict a trend for a declining dollar as inflation heats up in the USA going forward. So upward prices for commodities, lower costs and a declining dollar will drive even greater growth for Mosaic in 2021 and beyond. Add more here."
MOS Price target raised to $22.Thats a decent target although i think it goes much higher in the next 12 month.
June 40calls. open int. rose again yesterday. Me thinks MOS is in play.
how is this mgmt still employed?
With earnings this has been on our watchlist for potential day trades. Good luck to everyone out there. See what else is on our watchlist. https://daytrading.group/DailyTradeIdeas
"Another interesting fact ""from the field"".....My father is a corn and soybean farmer in Eastern Iowa. This weekend he said that he can't even get a quote or commitment on spring fertilizer. Pricing, supply / barge traffic / logistics are too tight for retailers to take the risk. This is a good indicator on volatility to come!"
Trade is popping up on my squeeze play scan. Looks like they will beat on top and bottom line Y/Y. I'm getting long.
ntr vs mos ? thoughts
"http://investors.mosaicco.com/Cache/IRCache/7808b91c-8d0c-edfd-855c-e4d1fbcef0c5.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=7808b91c-8d0c-edfd-855c-e4d1fbcef0c5&iid=4097833Q1 2020 earnings from website. By no means an expert, but these look better than expectations so tomorrow could be good (fingers crossed)"
I see a clear bull flag pattern formed on the 1 month chart. Yesterday evening through Monday morning will be the consolidation.
Time for gleaning.I don't get it why the price dropped. The DOC hearing is definitely positive for MOSAIC. International price is still on fire! I look forward to seeing Mosaic's earning.
"I added today too early, but I'm in for the long haul :) I went through the financials and imo they look more than good! Just the sales numbers were a bit a bummer, but the improved pricing looks tasty."
"These are great numbers! Gross margin up 10 folds, what other industry does that?"
(ADJUSTED) earnings per share of .57 versus .41 per share is all you need to know! negatively impacted by notable items of $77 million. We want to know what it was used for!
Sold today. Will move that cash into vaccines. Far more profits to be gained in short term. NVAX and DVAX. Possible 100%+ within sept/okt. Will come back after. GLTA.
I like what I see in this company!
As the international phosphate price keeps going up MOS will be more attractive with a good consumption in this year
Mosaic follows the price of Corn almost perfectly (look at the 30yr charts). I can see MOS getting to $60-$80 in the next few months
Don't sell below a 100. This is the biggest bull market for Agriculture in our lifetime. This stock will easily be over 100 by years end.
World Food Costs at Risk of Soaring as China Faces Tough Harvest https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/world-food-costs-at-risk-of-soaring-as-china-faces-tough-harvest
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"For those who share their thoughts and info on MOS, I previously suggested on August 3rd after their previous earnings release that management needed to consider a share buyback. I was suggesting it when the stock was $31.50 hoping it would help to support the stock after the announcement of the closure of the K1 & K2 and future opening of the K3 mine in early 2022. My hope at that time was that the stock would strengthen a support level above $30. The stock dipped into the $28 range shortly after and with the announcement of the share repurchase on August 23, the stock rebounded to it's current $32 level. As much as this is almost 20% from the recent high on the stock at $37, I believe a new buying opportunity will present itself in the next few quarters and 2022 will finally be the year this stock beats expectations and outperforms the market. For those who are patient with an 18-24 month time horizon, I believe MOS will be in the $50-$60 range."
"Mosaic beats by $0.12, beats on revs Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.11 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.01); revenues fell 6.1% year/year to $2.04 bln vs the $1.84 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net sales in the Potash segment totaled $555 million for the second quarter, down from $599 million one year ago, due to lower sales prices partially offset by higher sales volumes during the North America spring planting season."
The international price is still going up. Phosphate is definitely running out of inventory. And I think it will get severe. One of the main raw marterials is Ammonia. Many phosphate factories are struggling to secure their feedstock. Potash is also bullish at least in the states and brasil. As grain price is moving up so the farmers willing to purchase fertilizer even since price went up.
"PR by MOS of share repurchase. Very strong signal to the market. Now let's see if market reaction will be accordingly, I have good faith this will launch a nice run up this week!"
All commodities priced in US dollars have gotten beat up bad this week. The dollar index jumped to last November’s levels. They can’t seem to separate things like steel and copper from FOOD. Fertilizer producers are way oversold in a weak season of the market. IMHO this will shake out over the next couple of months.
"Are we in the first year of a multi(3 year?) bull market for agricultural products? Maybe yes. When all is said and done MOS could be a $75 stock, just maybe. At the least, from this level I see little downside and anexcellent chance to get above the $40 dollar level soon. Warning, my past predictions on the price of this stock have failed to materialize. I really thought we would be closer to $50 by late summer and we aren't."
"MOS crossed EMA(10) today at 31.5 and in the Buying Zone ... the next stop will be EMA(50) at 33 ...Analysts have target price at 32-47, average at 39 ... it will go much higher after breaking 32... keep an eye on it.Time to load up the boat with MOS now ...before it crosses 32 which is only 40 cents away. (31.60 at the time of typing)"
cant be in these markets when a tweet can send you down 5%.
"Do I hear 250-500m share buyback?? 2022 FCF can easily sustain it which debt has been significantly reduced this last 3 years. Would seem to make sense as the market is not ""fairly"" valuing the shares imho,"
"Hey everyone, I commented on rasoul’s post about the LITHIUM IRON PHOSPHATE BATTERY 3 days ago and JIN wanted me to share. I finally was able to get back here and share what I found. Supposedly it’s safer and lasts longer than other LITHIUM BATTERIES. Seems very interesting, here are some of the advantages. I’ll post the link at the end. Advantages and disadvantagesEditThe LiFePO4 battery uses a lithium-ion-derived chemistry and shares many advantages and disadvantages with other lithium-ion battery chemistries. However, there are significant differences.LFP contain neither nickel[20] nor cobalt, both of which are supply-constrained and expensive. Human rights concerns have been raised concerning the use of mined cobalt in batteries for distributed energy, home storage, and EVs.[21]LFP chemistry offers a longer cycle life than other lithium-ion approaches.[22]Like nickel-based rechargeable batteries (and unlike other lithium ion batteries),[23] LiFePO4 batteries have a very constant discharge voltage. Voltage stays close to 3.2 V during discharge until the cell is exhausted. This allows the cell to deliver virtually full power until it is discharged, and it can greatly simplify or even eliminate the need for voltage regulation circuitry.[citation needed]Because of the nominal 3.2 V output, four cells can be placed in series for a nominal voltage of 12.8 V. This comes close to the nominal voltage of six-cell lead-acid batteries. Along with the good safety characteristics of LFP batteries, this makes LFP a good potential replacement for lead-acid batteries in applications such as automotive and solar applications, provided the charging systems are adapted not to damage the LFP cells through excessive charging voltages (beyond 3.6 volts DC per cell while under charge), temperature-based voltage compensation, equalisation attempts or continuous trickle charging. The LFP cells must be at least balanced initially before the pack is assembled and a protection system also needs to be implemented to ensure no cell can be discharged below a voltage of 2.5 V or severe damage will occur in most instances.[citation needed]The use of phosphates avoids cobalt's cost and environmental concerns, particularly concerns about cobalt entering the environment through improper disposal.[22]LiFePO4 has higher current or peak-power ratings than lithium cobalt oxide LiCoO2.[24]The energy density (energy/volume) of a new LFP battery is some 14% lower than that of a new LiCoO2 battery.[25] Also, many brands of LFPs, as well as cells within a given brand of LFP batteries, have a lower discharge rate than lead-acid or LiCoO2.[citation needed] Since discharge rate is a percentage of battery capacity, a higher rate can be achieved by using a larger battery (more ampere hours) if low-current batteries must be used. Better yet, a high-current LFP cell (which will have a higher discharge rate than a lead acid or LiCoO2 battery of the same capacity) can be used.LiFePO4 cells experience a slower rate of capacity loss (aka greater calendar-life) than lithium-ion battery chemistries such as LiCoO2 cobalt or LiMn2O4 manganese spinel lithium-ion polymer batteries (LiPo battery) or lithium-ion batteries.[26] After one year on the shelf, a LiFePO4 cell typically has approximately the same energy density as a LiCoO2 Li-ion cell, because of LFP's slower decline of energy density.[citation needed]SafetyEditOne important advantage over other lithium-ion chemistries is thermal and chemical stability, which improves battery safety.[22] LiFePO4 is an intrinsically safer cathode material than LiCoO2 and manganese spinel, through omission of the cobalt, with its negative temperature coefficient of resistance that can encourage thermal runaway. The P–O bond in the (PO 4)3− ion is stronger than the Co–O bond in the (CoO2)−ion, so that when abused (short-circuited, overheated, etc.), the oxygen atoms are released more slowly. This stabilization of the redox energies also promotes faster ion migration.[23]As lithium migrates out of the cathode in a LiCoO2 cell, the CoO2 undergoes non-linear expansion that affects the structural integrity of the cell. The fully lithiated and unlithiated states of LiFePO4 are structurally similar which means that LiFePO4 cells are more structurally stable than LiCoO2 cells.[citation needed]No lithium remains in the cathode of a fully charged LiFePO4 cell. (In a LiCoO2 cell, approximately 50% remains.) LiFePO4 is highly resilient during oxygen loss, which typically results in an exothermic reaction in other lithium cells.[14] As a result, LiFePO4 cells are harder to ignite in the event of mishandling (especially during charge). The LiFePO4 battery does not decompose at high temperatures.[22]"
"high ag prices are going to drive this higher, much higher into summer I believe. I don't think people realize how much farmers will be spending on MOS's products this year. It's also an inflation play. Could maybe get back to $100 later in year, my target is $80. Just my opinions."
"Mosaic lowered forward guidance. The market trades on what a company will do, not what it has done. That is why Mosaic is getting battered after their earnings report."
Did you see Corn prices today - Up limit at a 7 year high !Will bode well for MOS and all fertilizer stocks . This is only the beginning of a price rise for MOS !!!!
Does anyone remember last earnings call when the price dropped 9% on the day when MOS announced an incredible earnings beat? What do people think will happen tomorrow? I want to buy more but wondering whether to wait until after earnings or to buy before earnings knowing earnings will be incredible? Would be good to get your opinion guys...
"The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased, with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.Following the upgrade, the most recent consensus for Mosaic from its 16 analysts is for revenues of US$10b in 2021 which, if met, would be a notable 19% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to bounce 66% to US$2.90. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$9.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.70 in 2021. There has definitely been an improvement in perception recently, with the analysts substantially increasing both their earnings and revenue estimates."
"$1.2B in sales in July 21.The Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) reported July 2021 sales revenue and volumes by business unit with potash, mosaic fertilizantes and phosphates indicating 24%, 51.9%, and 74.7% growth in sales revenues."
This is going to 60
Corn and beans up strong today after yesterdays set back. I think MOS could finish green today(down $1.06 currently). This is an inflation play actually kind of a derivative inflation play off high grain prices. We could be moving to a new higher plateau for grain prices in my opinions which would mean several years of growth and higher earnings for MOS. I think we are starting to see rotation out of massively over valued tech stocks that have grown revenues but show no evidence of ever turning a profit. Cathy Wood's ARK fund appears to have sprung a leak. Where is money going to go? Inflation plays that generate robust earnings. I still see MOS as a possible double this year from current levels. Just my opnions.
"Good things coming this year as news from end customers is pretty telling! The only potential counter news in this article is the following:“For a lot of the ‘I states,’ a lot of areas had a tremendous, long fall,” says Ferrie. “So, in some cases, 70% to 80% of our potash and our phosphate is already on.https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/corn/faced-high-fertilizer-prices-heres-why-sticker-shock-could-last-through-spring"
$40 Tues. morning after earnings and massive up guidance
"First big USDA crop report at 11am CST today. Brazil corn crop drying up. I do not expect today's report to be very accurate, they never seem to be. I think they will undercount acreage that ends up being planted and overestimate average yields for this year. Could be a problematic growing season for a number of reasons, I believe, but then what do I know. ""MOS for the double!!"""
This news made my Sunday morning:US Farmers Celebrate As Corn Exports Near Recordshttps://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/us-farmers-celebrate-corn-exports-near-recordsMOS has been basing at the levels it has been for quite some time now. I think it will start moving up now.
"This stock should be in the green anyway you look at it; once this earning circus is over and the dust settles, cash will naturally find its way back to this low risk high potential reward investment."
Interesting the pop in the share price......caused by a pop in corn futures. The pop in the futures was caused by news that less corn has been planted......which usually means less fertilizer is needed.
"Can anyone enlighten me on what's holding this stock down? As I understand it MOS shut down a potash mine and that was seen as a big interruption but still has many upgrades to buy. Bought in at 34$ back in June and this has just been played from 31$ range since. Maybe I should have bought SQM, appreciate any genuine feedback, thanks."
guys take a look at IPI also ... they have 0 debt and hardly any float ...
"For all who are posting about the current activity in MOS, you might want to review my previous post and a reply I posted 20 days ago on August 3rd after they reported their earnings. I think you will find the links I attached that day of interest and they all have dates they were published. The stock went as low as $29.15 after my posts and I was calling for a share buy back when the stock was $31.50."
Took a huge position on this stock years ago and have been in the hole for a long time. Today I am in positive territory and totally psyched. Hoping to actually see a decent return on my investment now.
"Mosaic has added a new press release to its website:THE MOSAIC COMPANY: Mosaic Announces April 2021 Sales Revenue and VolumesApr 2021 sales revenues across all 3 segments total $810 million vs $631 million year ago, a 28.4% increase.Stock price should double by year end!"
"Volume seems good, profits are up....so why the price drop? Because they are conservative with dividends? Seems like a prudent decision to me."
