NEVER BUY 6 months peak
it's overvalued still for the short term but intermediate term (3 months) should end at at least $55....I'll be adding MORE on any short term drops.

MOS reached a 52 Week high at 42.65
Looks like MOS is about to surge violently upwards. Big quarter results followed by analyst upgrades.
ntr vs mos ? thoughts
"Can anyone enlighten me on what's holding this stock down? As I understand it MOS shut down a potash mine and that was seen as a big interruption but still has many upgrades to buy. Bought in at 34$ back in June and this has just been played from 31$ range since. Maybe I should have bought SQM, appreciate any genuine feedback, thanks."
lost 40% of my stock value so far. I just want to break even and get out.
"Though there clearly isn't a direct tie here, I'm apt to believe the information in the following article bodes well for continued strength in fertilizer prices through at least the 1st quarter next year: https://www.agweb.com/news/machinery/used-machinery/machinery-pete-prices-planting-equipment-soar?mkt_tok=ODQzLVlHQi03OTMAAAF_3HkYTvzd1FBcsCZQXvkVlcDobq8unBHsBZn8SFSgN8MdUa782ntwIyjAWRwzq0rP0ikZWwxkJCD6VtEG1q3F1dKzBPzge263FWBDADrCN-uV30w"
"Another interesting fact ""from the field"".....My father is a corn and soybean farmer in Eastern Iowa. This weekend he said that he can't even get a quote or commitment on spring fertilizer. Pricing, supply / barge traffic / logistics are too tight for retailers to take the risk. This is a good indicator on volatility to come!"
guys take a look at IPI also ... they have 0 debt and hardly any float ...
Took a huge position on this stock years ago and have been in the hole for a long time. Today I am in positive territory and totally psyched. Hoping to actually see a decent return on my investment now.
Long term I’m still bullish on MOS. They have recently come up short on YOY volumes in all three sectors. This morning’s announcement about further shortfall in LA due to hurricane Ida is not going to help. Saving grace is fertilizer prices which are keeping revenues high I’m on the sideline now. Probably get back in Oct-Nov. GLTA
This is going to 60
"For those who share their thoughts and info on MOS, I previously suggested on August 3rd after their previous earnings release that management needed to consider a share buyback. I was suggesting it when the stock was $31.50 hoping it would help to support the stock after the announcement of the closure of the K1 & K2 and future opening of the K3 mine in early 2022. My hope at that time was that the stock would strengthen a support level above $30. The stock dipped into the $28 range shortly after and with the announcement of the share repurchase on August 23, the stock rebounded to it's current $32 level. As much as this is almost 20% from the recent high on the stock at $37, I believe a new buying opportunity will present itself in the next few quarters and 2022 will finally be the year this stock beats expectations and outperforms the market. For those who are patient with an 18-24 month time horizon, I believe MOS will be in the $50-$60 range."
"Well everyone, get ready for blowout earnings and SP north of 50 next week."
Fertilizer is very expensive.MOS should move higher sort-term
For the third day in a row over 1 million shares traded right after the close. The price spiked up to 31.75 and then fell back off. ￼ I saw this in August/September 2019 and it turned out they were repurchasing shares. No announcement was made until they had 3/4 of the approved amount bought. .￼2.059MM shares traded as of today’s close 3.38MM 10 minutes later. Once the announcement was made the last time the stock made a 20-30% run up. Let’s hope it happens again.￼
.28 a year hardly worth it
Potash is exploding and the mine will be coming online again/very soon. The regain in capacity with soaring prices should make MOS and easy double play within 6 month.
