"LUMN, has its routine down...one step forward, two steps back. I'm still waiting till one big freaking step forward. How long before that"
"Gee, it would be SO NICE to see a $12 handle on this stock by end of day. Who knows...stranger things have happened (like how a demented senior got into the White House)."
Shoulda woulda coulda …you could have loaded up under 12 last weekSo now load up Under 13 while you canLumn going to 15-17 soon opinion only g luck

"Amazing what a lil ol' 25 cent divy is really worth, huh? Which brings to forefront why Millions love divy stocks...it's the 'non-options' way to make a return on your investment and not have to sell the position to realize one! Many prefer that to constant trading in and out or keeping up with 'option chains'! jmo"
is the news of no dividend already baked into the current stock price? the stock price has been falling almost everyday since the announcement
"Excerpt from CTL's Q3 2013 ER, (over $18B Annual Revs?)""From our business market perspective, we experienced strong new sales to business customers for network and hosting services during the quarter. And also in the quarter we made strong progress on the share repurchase program we announced in February, through November 5th this year we repurchased 38 million shares or 6.1% of our outstanding common stock totaled approximately $1.3 billion.""""We have repurchased shares aggressively since the start of the program and we expect to opportunistically buyback additional shares going forward. Due to combination of dividend and share repurchases we return over $2.2 billion to shareholders through the first three quarters of the year, that’s a 63% increase compared to approximately $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2012.""Different Storey these days ehh?"
I see Active is really coming out with the goods today....not sure why we aren't taking off?
Is this a friendly or hostile.... you know what... [that word]?
Why has the share price been going straight down since it traded at $12.60 just a few days ago?
"Love the infrastructure, just not sure how we monetize it. Quarter after quarter and it grows no clearer. Nice dividend though."
"On 8/31/21 Short Interest(SI) was 92.29M shares owed, down slightly from mid-month(8/13) at 92.48M..."
"I think back to 2012 or so and remember CTL being compared to WIN and FTR and judged to have 'not enough Fiber'.Then in `17, Patel said ""no.3 buys no.4 and becomes no.2"", comparing CTL to T and VZ. Mr. Storey(2018) lays out a 3 year plan to ""Transform!"". Then it's extended to 4 or more! Nov 1st will be the 4th Year Anniversary. Congrats 2 All!Especially Management! I noticed on the Q2 ER(8/3) ONE thing was up ~110%!! y/y, Share-based Compensation Expense! lol"

"Question; The company has a number of open job postings, would this not be a sign of a growing company?"
Another fat dividend coming. Too bad all weak hands who could not interpret earnings call sold thinking a dividend cut was coming. So wrong. Next couple quarters will also have same dividend. Now back up we go above $13.
"Could someone explain this to me? I understand calls and puts and that a sweep is a large purchase or sale.Regarding LUMN (NYSE:LUMN), we observe a call option sweep with bearish sentiment. It expires in 63 day(s) on November 19, 2021. Parties traded 491 contract(s) at a $13.00 strike. This particular call needed to be split into 36 different trades to become filled. The total cost received by the writing party (or parties) was $34.7K, with a price of $69.0 per contract. There were 7298 open contracts at this strike prior to today, and today 597 contract(s) were bought and sold."
I sold calls at $14 12 days ago for $0.25 expiring Nov 5th.Have a buy to close order to see if I can buy the calls back for $0.05. Amazing if I can do that every month and collect 4 divi's per year ..Of course there's the impeding divi cull.
"Buy buy buy, plus Compounding dividend, heading to 15 very soon, with momentum 18-20 … opinion only g luck"
"Gerald, there is nothing faster or better than fiber optic connections for the Internet. Even if there are other Internet providers who provide that service, their speed and performance are only as good as the ""backbone"" of the Internet. And who owns the majority of fiber optic miles, that so-called ""backbone"" of the Internet? Lumen. Lumen is practically the foundation of the Internet in North America. Plain and simple."
"SI for eom July, reports today... was 91.1M mid-month. Note, excluding todays numbers, SV has totaled 18.4M since 7/30.That includes a whopping 9.4M sold short on 8/4 which dropped SP to a recent low of $11.09 intraday..."
"“Apollo invests in opportunities, communities and their people to achieve exceptional outcomes for investors and make a positive social impact,” said Jeff Storey, Lumen president and CEO. “With this transaction, the Apollo Funds will acquire a well-developed fiber backbone network spanning 20 states and generating consistent cash flow, along with the operations and back office support necessary to successfully operate the business on day one.”"
"So, in just a little over 2 months (since June 9), we are down the equivalent of over 15 dividend amounts in stock price."
"@AJ LUMN is now less than 2% of over a million dollar portfolio, after selling more shares of Lumen yesterday."
That Morg / Stan price target of $11.00 for LUMN yesterday was an insult. I hope this thing runs up fifteen points on the quick. Bust that Shorty right in the drawers. Let's see the big boys squirm and melt.
"Same ol' Storey... no new news! ""Dividends provide value to shareholders."" ha ""Can you update us on the $1B buyback?"" Storey: ""No, I can't. Closer to next ER, maybe."" This company is 'melting' like the wicked witch in the OZ. Sadly, since Lvl3 took over the board, it's gotten way worse. PPS is the evidence! $28 to $12, $2.16 to $1... DAMN!"
Added at 11.70 and 11.50
50 Day Moving Average is now $12.21. I think we have had to closes above this.
"Technically getting stronger. Insider buying increasing, rumors are growing stronger. Balance sheet is improving. Focus is better. Me thinks this is going higher."
Lumen hit $12.89 in the after-market. Will we cross the $13 line tomorrow? CNN Pre-market futures has already selected $LUMN as a gainer before the opening bell.
Lumen not invited to cyber security summit in DC?
"It appears the 64's on the IV are arguing about different kinds of 'Shorts'!! Both are bareish, err 'bearish' but only one counts in SI! lol"

"Now we're really on our way with more asset sales!<< Lumen Technologies to Sell U.S. Telecom Assets to Apollo for $7.5 Billion, Company Officials SayBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 4:01 PM ET 08/03/2021Lumen Technologies Inc.

The deal value includes $1.4 billion of assumed debt."
It is all good folks. Load up.
Ben Franklin long ago told everyone that 'time is money' and we all should know by now that fiber is the fastest and most reliable internet provider. The question everyone should be asking is why people question the future of LUMN?
SI (shares owed) increased by 7.49 Million shares in two weeks preceding the 15th of this month to 99.78M from 92.29M.Evidently those 'Short' out of touch Morons Love the Company Sales of Assets + announced direction... and so have(had)about $1.3 Billion bet against Lumn(at current valuations). Will they succumb to the Big Squeeze in the Future? hmm...
I'm lovin the heck out of LUMN.
This just keeps dropping huh ?
looks like takeover to me
takeover coming
"Re: quantum fiber salesDon't you think a company that would buy Lumen would audit the books? Sham sales never look good on the books because it looks like the company is trying to inflate income. Much like when Qwest had their salespeople go out and make all sorts of deals to get business and then those orders got canceled. In the end, an audit revealed they were only recording the sales, not the canceled orders which led Joe Nacchio to the federal slammer and the shareholders becoming bagholders, much like the people who swallowed Walter Scott's advice to hold their shares and they would be happy. All the while he was selling his shares in Level 3. - by slnter64"
"A substantial buyback at these prices will change 'perceptions' and would create more value for the Company & Shares!But, can they? Shorts laughed at the paltry $1B over two years when 'they sell' that much every 3 or 4 months and actually owe more than that at current SP and SI (about 20% more ($1.2B))! In 4 short yrs, From #2 to a 'WHAT???'! ;("
The next SI snapshot (for mid-month) is still a few days away but Fintel shows over 17.47M SV over the period covered(1st to 15th)... wonder how many were 'covered'? 92.29M shares were 'owed' on the EOM August `21 SI count.PPS Still up from the $11.91 open on 'x'(8/27) and up nicely on the last 1 year chart! Anyone else buy in the $8's? ;)
"Last call...to BUY under 12.50-13 a share, LUMN is heading to 15-17 very soon, and wont LOOK Back at 12-13, so BUY NOW, LOCK IN ON COMPOUNDING Dividendopinion only g luck folks"
$1B buybacks +$.25 in dividends = $100m a year in dividends reinvested at current levels. No way they would consider buybacks if they didn’t think they were undervalued. Loving this long term hold even more now.
Anyone know if LUMN is restricted from buying back shares for a period before earnings announcement? Seems the pattern has changed recently which might help explain the recent weakness?
This is soo cheap right now If I had 13B I would buy it all up ! Every time they knock it down just buy some more its probably over 12% short as it is.
12.75. 13 next
Where is Active? He is usually out on green days telling us the sky is blue.
"I'm of the opinion that the SOTP is legitimate and even the worst management cannot change this reality. The assets are built and in place with very defensible valuations and cannot be easily replaced. So I'll stay invested until much of this value is realized. I'm hoping the company just gets bought out at $30+ (buybacks will help to push this number up) as soon as the poison pill is gone because Storey et al. seem to change their strategy every three months, can't sell, and are doing everything in their power to stop the stock from realizing its true value. The problem is $30 represents a 150% premium to today's price which is almost unheard of - but only 45% on an EV basis. This is why debt reduction and buybacks are crucial and the stock needs to start trending upwards sooner rather than later. My opinion of the management team dives with each quarter of disappointment, broken promises and excuses. Another 5% revenue drop is inexcusable and shareholders seriously need to question if they trust management to spend even more capex based on ""belief"" when there are no results to show for it. I'm hoping a couple of influential shareholders put the appropriate pressure on them. People need to start looking at performance and not buzz words like ""4th industrial revolution"" ""success-based capex"" ""not capital constrained"" etc. They are clearly lies. Even Morche and Andrews have shown that their projections were reckless and we are not going to have a good second half of the year, and edge compute is not moving the needle yet. When exactly does this revolution begin, because I was under the impression that they don't move at a glacial pace. I like companies that underpromise and overdeliver. With LUMN we have the opposite, year after year after year - longer than I've been an investor in the company. It's the valuation of the assets that keeps me in, and that's been confirmed with the recent sales."
"Shares of Lumen Technologies (LUMN) have mostly been on the backfoot over the past few weeks following the company’s Q2 earnings. Investors have been concerned with the prospect of losing the payout of the largest dividend in the S&P 500. The company has said that after selling off some of its assets, it plans to push ahead with investments in fiber upgrades which could potentially force it to cut its dividend."
Didn't we tickle 13 last friday??Go 13
This stock is ready to break out!!!!
More fluff pr as the stock continues to crumble from the lack of sales growth
"The problem with this stock, other than poor execution by Storey, is he has left a major overhang on this stock with these divestures in not only how long they are going to take to close(way too long) but what the company is going to look like afterwards....nobody freaking knows."
takeover for sure
"Storey said, ""So we don't generally provide forecasts on trends in the market"" I wonder why, it couldn't be that all their internal forecasts have turned out to be completely wrong, could it? Funny how they rush to do all these buildouts while the demand lags way, way behind. Imagine if the capex was controlled and the extra money went to debt reduction and buybacks. And it looks like the lesson hasn't really been learned as all indications are they are prepping for a massive capex binge once the sales close.Talk about how important the dividend is but cut it (soon to be twice). Talk about how debt ratio is important but freeze reductions in place of capex Talk about how shares are undervalued, but announce a puny buyback program far too late, and refuse to even say if shares were bought during the post-earnings plunge. Back when Apple was undervalued and regularly getting beaten down for no good reason, management would put out press releases announcing that they took advantage of the dip and bought back a ton of shares. It would generally have an immediate stabilizing effect on the shares, and you can see the long term results. If only Lumen had similar competent management that looked out for shareholders."
"I like that leadership is tackling debt, focusing on core business, and that the world will continue to need fiber as demand for the online world grows. I bought today, wished it was on Friday. Oh well, I am long term now."
An article just surfaced indicating that LUMEN's lab for dealing with security issues has proven that a LINUX component in Windows could be used to gain entry to a system. This is wonderful news of an expertise that the US needs. How can LUMEN monetize this valuable service?

"Johnbadhands wrote this today:I am sure LUMN's assets will one day be in demand and critical. The problem is, where is the evidence that they will be able to extract any pricing power out of this? Look at their previous IRUs where they gave away their assets essentially for free. The risk of this happening again is certainly not zero, because all indications are that it is a buyer's market. Look at telecom that continue to pour billions into 3G, 4G, 5G while piling on debt - all of these services become essential but the translation into increased profits is weak. LUMN has established partnerships with a lot of massive companies but even lumped all together it's not moving the needle. Either demand remains anemic or they got hosed on the deals, or both. I'm also confused on what the continual endless capex spend is being used on. The edge is now reaching 97% of US enterprise. I was under the impression that they have ""future-proofed"" a lot of their buildout with empty conduits etc. Why not conserve capex at this point, buy back shares if the future is actually as inevitable as you say, and wait for the demand to actually show up before spending more? That is what a smart management team would do at this point."
"Looking back to 'x' day(8/27) the stock opened at $11.91(minus the .25 div), it closed at $11.97 and did that twice more by 9/10. The intraday low since 'x' was $11.81(8/30) and the High was $13.44(9/27). On the mid-month (9/15), SI increased to ~99.78M shares. SI for EOM September is reported tonight. Any buybacks since the last report? Curious?"

"It looks suspicious that the direction of LUMEN seems to make itself easier to be purchased as a company with the simple focus of having huge assets in terms of fiber in the ground. It's shed its legacy operations, based on its Louisiana roots of being a voracious rural telco. It's lightened up its overseas operations. What does that leave? It's a big bow on top of a present.Good possible news: If correct, LUMEN is worth much more as a bid-up asset for future-thinking corporations. If so, expect a doubling in the coming quarter or two when a bidding war is announced. If just one potential buyer, it should go up by half. Again, if this happens, in that process, ""shorts"" will lose their shorts."

Are we finally going to have a meaningful break to the upside.
"In a Motley Fool article called ""This Company Might Cut Its Dividend, but Its Stock Could Soar"", interesting options were discussed to focus on monetizing (i.e., streamlining) LUMN. Two large (legacy) assets are in the process of being sold for approximately $10 billion, combined thereby eliminating some long-term higher interest rate debt. Not bad. The author of the article describes LUMN as focusing on a ""better growth profile"" by searching out fiber optic projects. That's not bad, either. On top of that, the $1 billion stock repurchase program makes a lot of sense at the current LOW stock price.If LUMN decided to trim the exceedingly generous yield of the dividend and use that money to either buy back stock or pay down debt, I'd be in favor of that. Why? Over time, the stock price would increase significantly."
12.75 is key
"I and others have suggested, a buyback of ~50% of OS could be accomplished with asset sale money and still have money foraccelerated debt paydown(-$1.4B in the deal). $1B at $11 retires 91M, @ $12= 83.3M, @ $13= 77M etc... it could be done moneywise and shorts would feel the competition! CTL paid ~$9B cash to LvL3 for their 350M(?) shs (+1.423X's shs) in `17.Now, the buyback is $1B(2Y) but shorts had ~$1.2B cash floating in the pool at the 7/30 SI count? and 'shorts' have been selling 1-2M shares a day(avg) for years (that's only Fintel's count!). 'Course, 'They' have to buyback (return) at lows to make a profit! That's when the fulcrum shifts over-balance and U see what u saw on the merry-go-round again.;)The big unknown is Temasek shares? Does that high percentage of Foreign Ownership affect contract sells with Gov, Biz or repurchase? If it's an issue, couldn't a deal to purchase and retire Their shares be negotiated? If that clears the hurdle then why not buyback 50% at these ridiculous prices, it'd b cutting the div expense without cutting the shareholders throat ... again?EPS, PPS, short situation and company perception(etc) would all improve Dramatically! Div/FCF costs cut 50%? (~$550M?) But hey, I know plenty disagree! They say 'sell it all' 'cut or eliminate the div' altogether... seems they would choose that which benefits their position most... just like option players care only about their 'Strikes' and also r the most vocal at flip-flopping their (lip) positions too. ha jmo's"

Great company - reducing debt fast. It may get bought out by the big boys but I just hope they have to pay up for it big time. Say 50 and change.
This company is selling for about 1/4 of what it costs to put the fiber in the ground. Then add $10b in cash + IP+Good Will+CF. Seems very cheap with a real possibility of sale growth (finally) now that they are focused. My experience is a stock generally goes up when company announces it is buying its own stock.
"Lumen Technologies Inc. (LUMN)Our price objective is $8 based on a 4.5x 2021E EV/EBITDA multiple. This is a discount to AT&T and Verizon due to slower growth and higher leverage.Downside risks to our PO are increased competition from wireless, cable, and enterprise service providers and LVLT deal integration. Upside risks are faster than expected revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow growththis is from the BofA analyst. These morons are also advisors to LUMN on both their recent announced deals. Storey needs to fire them."

Storey takes a brutal beating on the SA message boards.

Jeff is the absolute worst at selling inside of the internet communications marketplace!Entlasse ihn!"
what was the best thing Storey spun yesterday?
"I was under the impression that Lumen has built/acquired one of the most expansive and future-proof low-latency fiber networks in the country that reaches 98%+ of businesses. I was also under the impression that the edge compute buildout is nearing completion and also reaches a similar percentage of enterprise. What do they keep spending capex on? They can carry on their FTTH buildout with their previous microtargeting strategy rather than going crazy at a time when there are multiple downgrades and an apparent pricing war brewing. This is the perfect time to reign in spending, clean up your balance sheet even more and focus on shareholder return. Look at the how the oil and gas industry suffered for years due to overbuild and oversupply. But as soon as their existence was threatened they started to cut supply, shelve projects and direct cash flow to debt paydown and share buybacks. Look at what's happening with commodities going through the roof due to structural undersupply and several companies 10x from their lows. A similar thing happened in the semiconductor industry where the big players managed their supply and have now created a strong pricing environment on their way to record revenues and profits. There is a lesson to be learned here, but it looks like the telecom industry is run by a bunch of dinosaurs who don't understand the basics of supply and demand. by johnbadhands"

Still at a loss but I am hopeful that the Cloud Business and the work for the USPS improves the bottomline.They need to sell the underperforming segments to Apollo, I have a position with Apollo as well.Fiber is the backbone of 5G, that is what interested me in the company from the beginning.

The story keeps getting better and better for LUMN. Big upside reval coming.

"Storey thought Lumen was undervalued at $13, so you can imagine how undervalued he feels it is currently. My strong guess is that he wouldn't even *dream* of advocating a divvy adjustment until the underlying stock itself is $16+ pps."
Eat it shorts!!
Need to go back to 15.

"Anyone know who's fiber this could be? - T-Mobile has quietly started selling fiber-based home internet, as tipped to T-Mo Report and confirmed by the company to The Verge. T-Mobile says it’s testing fiber optic internet in certain residential buildings in Manhattan as a complement to its fixed wireless offering, which it made available to the public in April. The company isn’t deploying an entirely new fiber network for the pilot; it’s running on a local provider’s fiber lines.Details on the dedicated T-Mobile Fiber site are thin, but it claims the service offers 940Mbps upload and download speeds. A Wi-Fi 6 router is included, along with chat and e-mail customer support for fiber customers. A T-Mobile rep had no other details to share with us, just that the program is a “very limited pilot” and more information would be shared “when and if” it becomes more widely available."

"assignment all 11.50 strike. expected and wrote as hedge for longer dated LUMN. still painful. to give up over 100K for the preme and few cents from the 11.44 basis. but, it's the play i always do and it always ends fine. option week 8-27 is bearish LUMN for the forthcoming div/direction announce whenever that will be."
They should have decided on and declared a must bigger buyback... but can they?Is the Foreign Ownership by Temasek of ~9% shares of all Lumen Stock an issue? Anyone?
"Active....KUDOS to you for your series of posts this morning. If we swapped out $5MM into BABA this morning, they would surely take Baba down, and Lumen up. There is an inner eye at the brokerage level that is there to seek and destroy the wealth of minnows around their table versus the WEALTH which they CONTROL.Lumen would still rise like a Phoenix from the Ashes and be uncontainable if the Billion Dollar Sales Contracts annually, not over ten years hit the wires enough times sooner rather than later, however. Think about the frustrated Apple shareholders who bailed in the late nineties or the wiped out Amazon shareholders in early 2K. Thing about Lumen and its predecessor, though, is the length of time for proving their SUCCESS is far from being reasonable--multi decades--and many will grow white hair and whiskers including many who will die before he it pays off. That's no way to ""invest."""
How is it Apollo can afford to pay $7.5 billion for our supposed legacy assets but we need to sell them to buy something else that can no longer support the dividend? Apollo isn't buying them to break even. They must be expecting to make more from our legacy assets than the entire value of Lumen. Can't we hire Apollo to run our business since they obviously know better how to run a successful operation?
What's up with LUMN this week? Are investors banking on Congress's infrastructure bill stimulating windfall profits for companies like LUMN?

"On this day of huge across the board gains, literally nearly every stock across my screens was displayed in green... except for this red holdout. All of the other stocks in my portfolio went up over two percentage points... some hit gains of over 5%... except this ONE. It makes me wonder why I should stay long with LUMN. I have not yet seen any evidence of significant strategic goals that will lead to significant gains. As a leader of fiber optic miles that make up the backbone of the Internet for North America, I'd expect more.Or, there is that notion of being bought out by another company... on the cheap. What is going on?"

People chillax. This is one of the highest paying dividend stocks of the s&p 500. Lots of dividend etfs hold this. Any mention of dividend cut will set off the trading algorithms. There is more value here than the current share price reveals. Let the froth settle or if you are bold take advantage of the sale going one. I never understand why people can’t wait to buy stocks when over priced and run away from a discount.

Looks like all those 'calls' at $12.50 are gone!
"Thinning out Lumen positionOriginally bought as high dividend value play. Since it is changing focus significantly, deserves a revaluation. Recent sales of business segments sounded promising as assets were sold off at good metrics. Selling off a lot of near term cashflow. Problem is that company is threatening to waste proceeds on new ""growth"" markets. Company has no real track record in growth. Would much prefer if proceeds were used to either paydown debt or buyback stock. While company tries to paint new investments as an extension of its business, it appears to be moving into more dynamic growth areas from a high cashflow no growth utility telecom/networking business. The businesses it is moving toward are not bad businesses. The problem is that I have no faith in current management being able to make the switch. If I want to invest in these businesses, I would prefer a management team with a track record of success. In general, I am in a reducing market exposure mode and therefore am looking more for what to trim than what to acquire.Msg 177341 of 177341 at 9/22/2021 10:34:19 AM by Zver1"
"T/VZ/LumnT and VZ at 52 week lows, TMUS down 20% from its 52 wk high and about to have a death cross on its chart, CHTR and CMCSA both falling significantly. Looks like the sector is in for some tough sledding going forward. I'm actually quite surprised Lumen has not dropped more. Maybe its coming, but the depressed valuation and the multiples on the recent sales must be holding it up. Unless there has been a change in the Enterprise business that we have not seen yet though this seems unlikely. With the bearish tone towards all these companies, does anyone expect anything positive to come out of the next earnings release? At this point, I just can't see it. by cafly2001"
"As far as the sale of our US assets to Apollo, I see benefits AND costs but hey that's just my 'limited' point of view. It would seem to me that those 'big picture guys' would consider the Long-Term loss of not just assets but loss of potential Growth in those areas? Edge comes to mind, altho down the road, IT IS on the road.(not in 20 states 4 Lumn?) It appears management thinks ST bennys outweigh LT losses? Needing $7 or $8 Billion for investment in FTT-X to Current Customers? Why not take advantage of Government Contracts (65B?) You've needed to build or upgrade those areas anyway?

LUMN would actually be *ideal* for a 'Reddit rush'...since history has shown LUMN is HIGHLY susceptible to short squeeze spikes even without targeted attempts by buyers.
Cheaper stock for takeover? This sudden drop makes it look like an engineered discount. I will hold.
"The Lumen trap, assume the future is a T-Mobile takeover. So we wait for that to happen collect an 8% dividend to keep us interested then merge. But at what price? If T-Mobile is the only bidder then it seems to me there will be a small premium paid. If this is the future then hopefully they sell more assets at a market premium and that cash is set aside for a larger premium for the balance of the assets that T-Mobile wants."
"All these years didn’t they say we are not constrained on the capex side / we invest in any project if there is sufficient return. Now they sell these assets so they can start doing more capex? They were disingenuous I guess on prior calls on this. If they are going to cut div with this new model, why not cutting now and investing more? Even enterprise revenue not increasing and I assume they were not holding back capex there or were they? Thoughts?"

"Storey needs to buyback shares. The asset sales were accretive to LUMN's intrinsic valuation, yet the stock is down significantly. This is an opportunity to buyback shares now!There has been a ton of debt paid down since then that equates to about $2/share at constant enterprise value. Management has publicly declared shares to be worth $24-35, meaning they are undervalued by 50-66% today, not accounting for the debt paid down since then. No doubt these are conservative estimates as they would not publicize aggressive ones. Given the above, the BoD would be foolish to hold back cash that is doing nothing but burning a hole in their pockets (they just cut capex and increased FCF guidance) in hopes of a $1-3 slide that may never materialize. The opportunity to buy back shares at a 60% discount is incredibly rare, and they better not be sleeping at the wheel here. It's already so accretive at this price that missing on a dollar or two will make very little difference in the long run, especially with only $1B to play with. Missing on the buyback altogether, however, will make a much bigger difference. Expecting a stock to go back to its 52 week low when it's already at historically low valuation multiples would be an extremely depressing scenario, and does not inspire any confidence in the company whatsoever. For a company that can't time their own revenue stream, I sure hope they aren't trying to time their stock buyback to the penny. It's a recipe for disaster."
Lumn should be at 20+. watch the bidding go for Lumn. Or maybe they will wait till they dump all the liability portions. They are trying to hold it down but Its easy to see it should be 20 at this point.
"I keep waiting for the Lumen/Palantir partnership announcement and connection since Palantir remains a crucial lynchpin ushering in The Fourth Industrial Revolution to the government and military like Lumen says it is supposed to. Lumen needs to pick up the pace of their sales announcements like Palantir. Jeff, shareholders NEED MUCH MORE FROM YOU CONSIDERING YOUR EGREGIOUS PAY FOR NONPERFORMANCE. Even the USPS contract is barely $100MM of the $800MM ceiling on that contract(just 12.5 percent max of gross proceeds!).Look at how PLTR cleans up the table stakes with high margin software services to the Military where all of our board members from various branches of the service sit, but we aren't seeing our BILLION DOLLAR contract sales wins as expected for 23 years similar to this Newbie Company PLTR.

"Lumen Technologies declares quarterly cash dividendDENVER, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) today announced that its Board of Directors voted to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share. The dividend is payable September 10, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2021. The ex-dividend date will be August 27, 2021."

"The Lumen CEO needs to go, he is out of his league, everything he touches is tainted by the incompetence he has put on full display since the day he told LVLT shareholders that merging with Lumen would produce a transformational tech company with surging revenues. The proxy put out for the combination of CTL & LVLT said 28 billion in revenue for 2020. It missed the mark by 30%. It was partially authored and certainly embraced by the NOW Lumen CEO. Maybe he didn't DO due diligence like one would expect from a CEO who tells his shareholders a deal is a GOOD move?! Wall Street has been on to this incompetence from the get go and all of their analysis has played out in real time since the deal closed. This then became a momentum play when it was clear that trust had been broken in the early days of the current CEO telling tall tails about divy sustainability, cutting of unprofitable revenue, enterprise, enabling the 4th industrial revolution, low latency, edge and now mass market opportunities in the footprint retained in the recent Apollo deal... The incompetence has remained on full display as it would appear the plan has been formulated and changes quarterly with a dartboard being the main determining factor.. To be crystal clear. I believe the assets have value. That being said, the numerous articles and comments for the past 3-4 years supporting Lumen at a much higher valuation have ALL ignored the same thing. They have ignored the outsized role played by Lumen leadership and these multigenerational lows in PPS. Current leadership needs to be retired or replaced through sale of the company for shareholder to reap the benefits of these assets. Going on 4 years, how anyone can still believe in current leadership is beyond me."
Generating $10b in cash and becoming a pure play - does this make LUMN a buyout target to someone who can grow the business?
"Once smart money digest the sell of some Lumn assets, and game plan to lower debt , buy back shares and try to maintain the great dividend, which is what keeps buyers interested.Lumn just needs a good rally with momentum now, get its stock price and market cap higher and the Dividend should be safe, and if they cut it better be a slight cut like 2% not 4% that be a slap to Longs and any Future buyers etcLumn at this price and Compounding dividend is a Huge BUY…Opinion only g luck"

"anyone else see a 'calculation' of share value after the asset sales? I borrowed LUMN's calculation they did a while back, updated it for the alleged multiples they actually got on the two sales, made some assumptions about how much debt they would pay down & share buybacks they'd do and I don't get a materially different 'share value' on a before or after basis. This also doesn't assume any EBITDA growth from new business from their CAPEX in higher growth opportunities. Still seems like a share price double is deserved; feel free to poke holes in this. Before EBITDA Multiple Mkt Value CTL $5,500 5.50 $30,250 LVLT $3,000 9.50 $28,500 $8,500 $58,750 Debt $(31,000) Value $27,750 Outstanding shares 1,093 Estimated Market Value/Share $25.39 After EBITDA Multiple Mkt Value CTL $4,136 5.50 $22,750 LVLT $2,716 9.50 $25,800 $6,852 $48,550 Debt $(24,000) Value $24,550 Outstanding shares 1,056 Estimated Market Value/Share $23.25"
"I wish I knew more about the articles and press releases I see about LUMN success stories in dealing with security. To me, that sounds like an essential service, at various tiers, a massive fiber provider could offer as revenue streams. How significant is LUMN's role in providing top level security for its biggest clients? Is that a relevant growth area? Or is it just a small slice of overall future earnings?"
I ask again... Is Temasek ownership a problem for share repurchase and retirement of >100M or so shares?

"All in all, LUMN is holding well considering the minor correction, across the board, today. An increase of a penny is better than a drop of several percentage points in these turbulent times.LUMN is really UNDERVALUED. It is my second largest position in my portfolio. I'm very happy with my decision to stay long on the company that is positioned perfectly for business reliance on the Internet. It can only go up in value because it owns the backbone of the Internet. Those many many thousands of fiber miles aren't going anywhere. And, it seems to me, there is real effort and evidence that monetizing what was once CenturyLink makes absolute sense. Refinancing overall debt makes perfect sense, too. Buying back shares at these low stock prices is good business. I look forward to the next inevitable dividend."
It is all good. Either an acquisition or a move to the up side oncethe 2 deals close for the Latin American business and the 20 local exchanges. They total over S10 billion ....Smaller more focused company with high growth prospects or part of a larger entity at a premium.
Another +3% jump in LUMN indicates that this company is UNDERVALUED. (The stock buyback program doesn't hurt things either...)
"South Korean laws are different than those in the US and the entire socialistic (and elitist Silicon Valley) politics around Net Neutrality in the US will fully preclude such a legal ruling from having any affect in the US (or Europe imo).

It was hard enough trying to make progress to reverse the net neutrality rules when the Republicans controlled both houses and the White House...that any attempt to do so now is doomed to failure."

"@ActiveI posted a similar message a while back that LUMN's high debt level was/is due Post's realization that CTL was in serious trouble due to the rural nature of the majority of it's customers. Post had spent serious amounts of money on a huge training center in the backwoods of Louisiana, Monroe, which will never be a prime location for corporate HQ. Therefore, to acquire LVLT he had to borrow huge sums of money to support a sinking company valuation that Storey was never going to give into without the cash to pay to the investors/owners of LVLT! Now Storey is attacking the debt reduction elephant, which he inherited. LUMN is a gold mine that will eventually blossom into a major player in the coming months & years, and probably be acquired by one of the wireless giants."

"An interesting fact that I have not seen discussed here concerning the land line business: some of those areas the land line link from residence back to the central office is mostly fiber. I can't speak for all areas, but here they have fiber running from town out to the rural areas, and along the way they have distribution points (I have no idea what they are really called) where the signal is converted to copper for the last mile.I haven't put any effort into trying to figure out the value of that arrangement, I just find it interesting that copper plays less and less of a role."
Looking forward to shorts forking over the cash for my next dividend.

"That U.S. Postal Service contract is a strong buy signal if there ever was one for $LUMN. Add to it the +.25 cent per share quarterly dividend, and you have a duck on a pond with this investment."
What time is the farmer telling his storey today?
"So even if we buy after hours tonight, we still get the dividend for the new shares we buy, right?"
Surprised this company has not been acquired for the fiber backbone.
"Seems like the selloff should be happening tomorrow (ex divided date), not today. I certainly expected the selloff, just not today. I really thought that today would see one final push to $12.50. I take this premature selloff as a very bearish signal. We should recall that, just prior to the Company confirming this quarter's dividend, the share price was crashing down to low $11. It has since seen a 10% surge in price (going from a low of $11.28 last Thursday to a high of $12.43 today). So the fact that investors are selling the news on today's end-of-dividend buy-in suggests to me that the smart money concluded that taking profits on the 10% price runup was smarter than staying invested for the $0.25 dividend (especially considering that a minimum 0.25-point drop in share price on Friday was all but guaranteed). Personally, I wouldn't be surprised to see LUMN tumble back down to $11.50 over the next few days."
So bad I sold all my shares good luck though

"Folks, the only thing passing under talijoe is 1.5 infrastructure bill, which actually goes mostly towards Real infrastructure projects, not the 3.5 wish list open bar of the blue demos,So no doubt when the bi partisan 1.5 passes, Lumn will see a bump to 15-20 range, and as everyone Knows If not enjoy the nice healthy Compounding dividend until the stock price pops, Last chances to own Under 13, lock and load up on Lumn plus Compounding Dividend Opinion only g luck"
"I am Active and I have resigned to the fact that the Infrastructure Bill if and when signed, will mean little if any revenues to Lumen."
Knocking on the 13 door again!!If we can go through that door maybe this will finally make its move to 15!!
"Dividend will be paid out for about the next year imo. 8ish% not too bad.$1 B share buyback will retire close to 7.5% of shares depending on price. Not too bad.I would think the buyback could be done in a way to prevent the share price from dropping too much. That way we have a floor so to speak, and company buys shares cheap.After that, they'll have to prove they are a growth stock."
Fair value should be around 17$. I also think this stock is about to pop.
"Is the reason Lumen isn’t getting more awards for government contracts, due to their network still having a lot of Huawei gear?Among that response you mentioned: “last I heard, the ""legacy"" Level 3 network contains alot of Huawei kit: if that's still the case, given that Huawei's big push is to have the West buy more of its equipment, I think Level 3/LUMN would be low on the list of China's retaliation targets.” Is this still the case? Do you know the limits of Huawei gear in telecom and Lumen specifically? I’ve read clear statements by Verizon that they don’t use any Huawei stuff. And two things I have read on this were that most telecom providers didn’t either: “None of the US’s ""big four"" wireless carriers—AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile—use Huawei equipment, Huawei executive Tim Danks confirmed earlier this year. (2019 - ed) Neither do cable internet providers Comcast or Charter.“ And more recently, the article referenced by thinkith showed a clip where England is replacing Huawei stuff with Nokia components, and then this statement: “The U.K. government has banned installation of Huawei’s 5G equipment in the country as of this month, and has demanded operators remove all of such equipment by 2027.“ So my question: if Lumen still has a lot of Huawei gear in their network, is that holding back any award of any government contracts?"
"Will T-Mobile buy Lumen before Microsoft does?""T-Mobile is making noise about taking share in the enterprise space from T and VZ and they seem eager to push aggressively in this space. It would be very good for both Lumen and T-Mobile to have some clear, early successes. Lumen should be highly motivated to get their stock pice up to a respectable level before T-Mobile starts to openly try to buy them."" https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=444&mn=176191&pt=msg&mid=22251792 ————————— T-Mobile and Lumen court joint enterprise, government customers ""Lumen’s network is comprised of approximately 450,000 global route miles of fiber and more than 180,000 on-net buildings.

I am told the reason for the downgrade issued on the last day of the quarter was the company wanted to buy back another 3.5 million shares before close of quarter at around $12.50 or under. BoA is assisting in the buyback.
Did Patel have much operational experience?.......need to bring him back and change the page on this storey. Jeff Storey just has not been getting it done.
Just checked Redditt and LUMN was listed as a top target FWIW...
let's go!
It was a great talk and the stock is turning green.... too bad the network quality cut out some of his word..... did he say they are going to Tampa Bay??
Surprised to see the after-hours pop to $12.20. What’s that all about?!?
Under heavy hidden accumulation.
Good entry below $12. Back in again. Have only held for dividend capture and short term capital gains. Stock never seems to break out but moves in a pretty reliable trading range.

I am impressed with the $10b they managed to raise selling assets. Does anyone know the impact to sales? Seems the biggest hurdle with this company is growing sales when they have a leading edge offering (pardon the pun). I am seriously considering this investment now that they are less burdened with debt.

this meager slide is not enough to interest me. market makers will have to do alot better.
