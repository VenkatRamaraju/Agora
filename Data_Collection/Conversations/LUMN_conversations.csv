In 4 short yrs, From #2 to a 'WHAT???'! ;("

Down another 'dividend' in value. ???
Why the 4% jump? No news to back it up.
"This whole thread is about edge computing. In that context 5ms refers to the time it takes light to travel from an edge compute location to a user. And the part of the network mostly traversed is the access network. Not the long haul network. Depending on where Lumen has placed the edge nodes it is possible that some long haul fiber is traversed, but extremely unlikely. As such that press release holds little to no relevance to the edge compute service."

Can't we all just get along? Peace and harmony.
"Lumen path forward with FTTH is more like FTTE. Focus on bringing more enterprises on-net, not residences. Shifting away takes time.In the meantime, they are also clearly putting effort into improving customer experience for portions of their net servicing mostly retail customers and SMB if anything to gain value with a potential acquirer who can win-win service them better and at a profit per relatively small ARPU and large churn. Can't help losing the enterprise customers in that mix, for now. Maybe win them back with future FTTE."
