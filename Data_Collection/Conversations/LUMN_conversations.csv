nice aftermarket comeback...what's gonna happen tomorrow?
"What keeps LUMN a Public Traded Company. If they pay down the Debt, if they see continued pressure, why can't they buy all the stock back and go Private. Eliminate the Dividend alone would almost Finance the buy back."
Just so you guys know level 2 chart Showing there’s a lot of sellers￼
Long live the .25 DIVIDEND!!!!!
Fair value should be around 17$. I also think this stock is about to pop.
"Lumen IS an infrastructure play... nice chart, too with the EMA(21) just now crossing over the SMA(50)..."
is the news of no dividend already baked into the current stock price? the stock price has been falling almost everyday since the announcement
Cowan raises PT to $13 from $12.
"Angry little board today. Selling weak assets for a nice multiple and $1 billion in buy backs! Sure there is talk of a divi reduction or elimination but I'd rather rip the band aide off vs letting these analysts talk doom and gloom and speculate on a cut one day. The Divi is nice but not why I'm in this stock, the transition to a growth company (mirror what Level 3 was), and getting rid of CTL assets and a little fiber all the right moves. If you hold this company for a divi you've been given a year of notice, period...right move by Storey. Those that have a vision for where the company will be in 2-3+ years will be rewarded IMO. P.S. myself and probably LUMN will be buyers of shares today."
"LUMN has HUGE assets , with the recent sell of assets, and 7. b plus in cash , LUMN plans forwardpaydown debts intrest, buybacks etcyou can buy LUMN UNDER 12!! LUMN is ready to POP big time up to $15-20 range very soon, plus the Compounding Dividend, Load UP at this price point, Dont Bottom Fish, You Snooze Youll Lose!!opinion only g luck"
"People are grossly underestimating LUMN. Once the infrastructure bill is passed in September, LUMN is likely to get a lion's share of BROADBAND money. $65B allocated in for broadbands in infrastructure bill."
20$ Stock easily....we are the early birds smell some nice upside.
Smart people who actually *listened* to the last conference call could discern a LOT from the tone of the execs' voices. It's just a matter of time.
"About Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) Brand""CenturyLink is a telecommunications firm that provides broadband, voice, wireless, cloud IaaS and managed services for consumers and businesses."" Among its major competitors, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) is ranked in 7th place for NPS while Cogent Communications is 1st, and Equinix is 2nd. Overall, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) has a negative social sentiment, when analyzing social media channels and online mentions. Their current market cap is $12.07B."
Has anyone done an estimate as to the value of the remaining LEC territory (in comparison to the footprint that was sold)? I would be surprised if a sale of the remaining territory isn’t coming soon. This company is worth more in pieces than as a whole.
"Could someone explain this to me? I understand calls and puts and that a sweep is a large purchase or sale.Regarding LUMN (NYSE:LUMN), we observe a call option sweep with bearish sentiment.

"LUMN settles the DOJ Civil Claim today at 11 am, 2pm"
Good entry below $12. Back in again. Have only held for dividend capture and short term capital gains. Stock never seems to break out but moves in a pretty reliable trading range.
Another +3% jump in LUMN indicates that this company is UNDERVALUED. (The stock buyback program doesn't hurt things either...)
Nice pop in price! There must be something going on.... or people are figuring out how undervalued LUMN is...
Any technical or charting experts out there? Looks like 12.28 might be next major support. Bought more at 12.60 thinking that was support.
Wasn’t expecting it to drop 12% today

"Lumen Technologies declares quarterly cash dividendDENVER, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) today announced that its Board of Directors voted to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share. The dividend is payable September 10, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2021. The ex-dividend date will be August 27, 2021."
This share price should be a lot higher

Wait till they report. A reduction of 2.7 B in debt or something like 2 B in debt cancellation and 700M stock buy back. Right now the stock buy back is reducing the 7.8% dividend spent but if you buy bonds it only gives you 5-6 %. This stock should double soon.

Traurig!
My guess is once the sale is completed Tmobile will come nocking. look for sale or merger.
"My listening to the call says we keep the divvy at the same level for 2 years...because he said ""might pressure the dividend as the transactions close"". Well, the transactions won't close for minimum of two years. And who knows, the divvy might remain AS IS indefinitely, as interest expenses will be cut with debt paydown and a nice profit will materialize from shares repurchased at rock bottom prices."
"Check out LWAC, Locust Walker Redeemed it's shares catching shorts with no option. Up $15 LUMN will have the same option. Lowering Debt could make the balance of the Company more desirable for a Merger."

"The bondholders, aka, IB's and their hedge fund customers swing trade this thing weekly at 3-5 percent returns making the dividends payable on their short accounts to be a walk in the park.

The biggest question that is being asked. They have been promoting edge computing. They were going to use the central offices to remove latency to end user. What happens to edge in these states? I guess it is gone? and Why?
"It's so disapointing that a company that was built from the ground up (Level 3) to be the backbone of the internet yet they cannot create value for it's shareholders. I agree that they are preparing to sell to T Mobile and therefore are going through the motions and cleaning up the balance sheet and spending capital for that purpose, but to be taken for a ride and being lied to year in and year out is criminal. If the price they sell at is at a low premium, then the I hope the attorneys come out of the woodwork and take them to the shed. Crowe, Story and Post and top management have made out very well over a long period of time with executive compensation packages, stock options etc, and have treated shareholders like puppets along the way."
This what happens when you listen to outsiders and not continue with a plan. They never were going to sell the consumer business. Over the past 2-3 years there has been a push by advocate investors and analysts that said to sell the consumer business to unlock shareholder value. Where are they now? Should have just kept the asset and built it better
"Gerald, there is nothing faster or better than fiber optic connections for the Internet. Even if there are other Internet providers who provide that service, their speed and performance are only as good as the ""backbone"" of the Internet. And who owns the majority of fiber optic miles, that so-called ""backbone"" of the Internet? Lumen. Lumen is practically the foundation of the Internet in North America. Plain and simple."
"Storey needs to buyback shares. The asset sales were accretive to LUMN's intrinsic valuation, yet the stock is down significantly. This is an opportunity to buyback shares now!There has been a ton of debt paid down since then that equates to about $2/share at constant enterprise value. Management has publicly declared shares to be worth $24-35, meaning they are undervalued by 50-66% today, not accounting for the debt paid down since then. No doubt these are conservative estimates as they would not publicize aggressive ones. Given the above, the BoD would be foolish to hold back cash that is doing nothing but burning a hole in their pockets (they just cut capex and increased FCF guidance) in hopes of a $1-3 slide that may never materialize. The opportunity to buy back shares at a 60% discount is incredibly rare, and they better not be sleeping at the wheel here. It's already so accretive at this price that missing on a dollar or two will make very little difference in the long run, especially with only $1B to play with. Missing on the buyback altogether, however, will make a much bigger difference. Expecting a stock to go back to its 52 week low when it's already at historically low valuation multiples would be an extremely depressing scenario, and does not inspire any confidence in the company whatsoever. For a company that can't time their own revenue stream, I sure hope they aren't trying to time their stock buyback to the penny. It's a recipe for disaster."

"Jeff Storey is the epitome of what John describes in the telecom space.

Jeff's customers are different than John's since John's were the non techie ""consumer"" at the very end of the network. Jeff's customers are larger ""businesses"" who sell to or access John's customers.Jeff's customers need to be dealt with more firmly by way of ""increased prices"" in spite of what they wish otherwise!

"Why is it dropping like a rock, guess some did not like the conference call?"

"LUMN receives $26+ price targetIt is quite fair to say that LUMN stock is undervalued and would make for a better investment than AT&T. Additionally – similar to AT&T – LUMN has a fairly high debt burden whose maturities it has managed to ladder pretty well to avoid any major financing risk.The tale here, however, differs from T’s in one essential manner that prompted us to recently become shareholders: LUMN is CHEAP!It is currently trading at a paltry 5.3x projected EBITDA, a significant discount to its historical average of 5.5x. While this is not a substantial discount, it is significant considering that interest rates have fallen dramatically over the company’s history, and its portfolio is now much more heavily concentrated in high-quality fiber assets with good development prospects and significant long-term growth tailwinds of the 4th Industrial Revolution.With this factored in, I believe Lumen Technologies (LUMN) could very well reach above the $26 dollar price point, and many other analysts agree with this idea.Bottom line is LUMN is dirt cheap and has a very clear route to development through its increasingly focused portfolio of core growth fiber assets, while having similar high leverage and chronically poor performance.

"If ""Success Based Capex"" was truly 3 year paybacks or greater than 30 percent per year return on capital as warranted by management over decades including Level 3, then it makes no sense why Berkshire hasn't taken this company over already in order to capitalize on the ""FTTH"" builds that would be accomplished so much faster than their impaired balance sheet would permit otherwise.We know the paybacks are not even close to that so we are merely fantasying what this management team has placed in our minds over ""decades"" while realizing how GREAT of a LIE these representations have continued to have been. IF it were close to being true, a JV with a well capitalized Tech Partner instead of a ""take under"" by a Berkshire would be acceptable in order to suspend our disbelief system in the hopes they sell the whole balance of the company sooner rather than later. Just like clockwork into the close--while writing-- away goes and will continue to go the majority of today's gains since Tech Freaks are predicting a major downfall established by a death cross of the 50 day sma moving lower than the 200 sma with no ability to raise its neckline above the $12.30 area ""marker.""

"Lastly, the dividend. We have long stated that we believe return of cash in the form of a dividend is an appropriate capital allocation vehicle in a business like ours. However, with these transactions, the profile of our business is changing and will change rapidly going forward as we lean into investing for growth and continuing to rationalize the portfolio. I do realize that will put pressure on our dividend after we close these transactions and the further we get into our investment program.The question is when on the dividend not if. Also the enterprise segment was down YoY so no one can see prospects for growth"

"Where are the multi billion dollar government enterprise and military contracts that Lumen's differentiated, best in class network with fastest speeds and highest level of security facilitates? Why does this Sean Connery Network, Agent 007, not sell like Peter Theil's Palantir Company to the U.S. Government in partnership with their Military as well as other governments around the world? We hold a basis of $11 in PLTR with high hopes of trillion dollar market caps over the coming years. That was a similar expectation for these BUMBLE HEADS during the past 23 years! EOM"
Why has the share price been going straight down since it traded at $12.60 just a few days ago?
"It looks suspicious that the direction of LUMEN seems to make itself easier to be purchased as a company with the simple focus of having huge assets in terms of fiber in the ground. It's shed its legacy operations, based on its Louisiana roots of being a voracious rural telco. It's lightened up its overseas operations. What does that leave? It's a big bow on top of a present.Good possible news: If correct, LUMEN is worth much more as a bid-up asset for future-thinking corporations. If so, expect a doubling in the coming quarter or two when a bidding war is announced. If just one potential buyer, it should go up by half. Again, if this happens, in that process, ""shorts"" will lose their shorts."
"Seems like the selloff should be happening tomorrow (ex divided date), not today. I certainly expected the selloff, just not today. I really thought that today would see one final push to $12.50. I take this premature selloff as a very bearish signal. We should recall that, just prior to the Company confirming this quarter's dividend, the share price was crashing down to low $11. It has since seen a 10% surge in price (going from a low of $11.28 last Thursday to a high of $12.43 today). So the fact that investors are selling the news on today's end-of-dividend buy-in suggests to me that the smart money concluded that taking profits on the 10% price runup was smarter than staying invested for the $0.25 dividend (especially considering that a minimum 0.25-point drop in share price on Friday was all but guaranteed). Personally, I wouldn't be surprised to see LUMN tumble back down to $11.50 over the next few days."
"Question; The company has a number of open job postings, would this not be a sign of a growing company?"
"Buyback money? hmm... what is FCF(3B?) and CapEx(3.5B+?), isn't that all 'pocket money'? SO, what's it ALL used for?I know, all 'prudent things'?! Do any of them return 7 or 8% Annually henceforth starting on the next Q... guaranteed? Management said Lumn's 'not Capital constrained'? How about Any CapEx savings in LATAM b4 the $2.735B sale money shows?"
"The Lumen CEO needs to go, he is out of his league, everything he touches is tainted by the incompetence he has put on full display since the day he told LVLT shareholders that merging with Lumen would produce a transformational tech company with surging revenues. The proxy put out for the combination of CTL & LVLT said 28 billion in revenue for 2020. It missed the mark by 30%. It was partially authored and certainly embraced by the NOW Lumen CEO. Maybe he didn't DO due diligence like one would expect from a CEO who tells his shareholders a deal is a GOOD move?! Wall Street has been on to this incompetence from the get go and all of their analysis has played out in real time since the deal closed. This then became a momentum play when it was clear that trust had been broken in the early days of the current CEO telling tall tails about divy sustainability, cutting of unprofitable revenue, enterprise, enabling the 4th industrial revolution, low latency, edge and now mass market opportunities in the footprint retained in the recent Apollo deal... The incompetence has remained on full display as it would appear the plan has been formulated and changes quarterly with a dartboard being the main determining factor.. To be crystal clear. I believe the assets have value. That being said, the numerous articles and comments for the past 3-4 years supporting Lumen at a much higher valuation have ALL ignored the same thing. They have ignored the outsized role played by Lumen leadership and these multigenerational lows in PPS. Current leadership needs to be retired or replaced through sale of the company for shareholder to reap the benefits of these assets. Going on 4 years, how anyone can still believe in current leadership is beyond me."
"I'm of the opinion that the SOTP is legitimate and even the worst management cannot change this reality. The assets are built and in place with very defensible valuations and cannot be easily replaced. So I'll stay invested until much of this value is realized. I'm hoping the company just gets bought out at $30+ (buybacks will help to push this number up) as soon as the poison pill is gone because Storey et al. seem to change their strategy every three months, can't sell, and are doing everything in their power to stop the stock from realizing its true value. The problem is $30 represents a 150% premium to today's price which is almost unheard of - but only 45% on an EV basis. This is why debt reduction and buybacks are crucial and the stock needs to start trending upwards sooner rather than later. My opinion of the management team dives with each quarter of disappointment, broken promises and excuses. Another 5% revenue drop is inexcusable and shareholders seriously need to question if they trust management to spend even more capex based on ""belief"" when there are no results to show for it. I'm hoping a couple of influential shareholders put the appropriate pressure on them. People need to start looking at performance and not buzz words like ""4th industrial revolution"" ""success-based capex"" ""not capital constrained"" etc. They are clearly lies. Even Morche and Andrews have shown that their projections were reckless and we are not going to have a good second half of the year, and edge compute is not moving the needle yet. When exactly does this revolution begin, because I was under the impression that they don't move at a glacial pace. I like companies that underpromise and overdeliver. With LUMN we have the opposite, year after year after year - longer than I've been an investor in the company. It's the valuation of the assets that keeps me in, and that's been confirmed with the recent sales."
Surprised this company has not been acquired for the fiber backbone.

"Infrastructure Bill Money is going to cause this stock to run. Money will go for Broadband before everything else, since it is easy to get things rolling."
"Based on the prices of the transactions, someone estimated the equity value now at $25 per share. Call that Adjusted Book Value, adjusted to market value by virtue of current, relevant transactions. Any company that can buy stock back at under one-half of adjusted book value should do so as fast as they can, including selling more non-core assets to do so and, by the way, eliminating the dividend. Imagine what happens to the value per share if they could retire half their shares at $11+. The other effect of retiring shares is that it offsets the decline in revenue per share that the company has been delivering. However, I am not that happy with suggestions of more money on CAPEX. It seems to me that the return from buying shares back is a lot better and more certain than they appear to have been delivering from CAPEX."

Now they seem to realize that there are assets 'worth investment' in CTL's Legacy, but choose to 'sell' a large portion to fund it!I would continue to expand on these thoughts if I felt they would be accretive to the situation, but I'm sure I willreceive many a rebuke on these few points already so... Good Luck to all who have rode it out to this point. Sad just Sad!"
Need to go back to 15.
That Morg / Stan price target of $11.00 for LUMN yesterday was an insult. I hope this thing runs up fifteen points on the quick. Bust that Shorty right in the drawers. Let's see the big boys squirm and melt.
"As far as the sale of our US assets to Apollo, I see benefits AND costs but hey that's just my 'limited' point of view. It would seem to me that those 'big picture guys' would consider the Long-Term loss of not just assets but loss of potential Growth in those areas? Edge comes to mind, altho down the road, IT IS on the road.(not in 20 states 4 Lumn?) It appears management thinks ST bennys outweigh LT losses? Needing $7 or $8 Billion for investment in FTT-X to Current Customers? Why not take advantage of Government Contracts (65B?) You've needed to build or upgrade those areas anyway? At least try... when/if they get(go) passed the House(s)! ha Evidently Enterprise is ALL that matters to management!Q1 ER vs Q2 ER are like different Companies! I knew they were exploring all options, just thought they wanted More!All of a sudden they seem 'desperate' to complete the 'transformation' to a much 'smaller' corporation w/less Revs!More like Storey's other story w/o divs?

"An interesting fact that I have not seen discussed here concerning the land line business: some of those areas the land line link from residence back to the central office is mostly fiber. I can't speak for all areas, but here they have fiber running from town out to the rural areas, and along the way they have distribution points (I have no idea what they are really called) where the signal is converted to copper for the last mile.I haven't put any effort into trying to figure out the value of that arrangement, I just find it interesting that copper plays less and less of a role."

"@ActiveI posted a similar message a while back that LUMN's high debt level was/is due Post's realization that CTL was in serious trouble due to the rural nature of the majority of it's customers. Post had spent serious amounts of money on a huge training center in the backwoods of Louisiana, Monroe, which will never be a prime location for corporate HQ. Therefore, to acquire LVLT he had to borrow huge sums of money to support a sinking company valuation that Storey was never going to give into without the cash to pay to the investors/owners of LVLT! Now Storey is attacking the debt reduction elephant, which he inherited. LUMN is a gold mine that will eventually blossom into a major player in the coming months & years, and probably be acquired by one of the wireless giants."
"In a Motley Fool article called ""This Company Might Cut Its Dividend, but Its Stock Could Soar"", interesting options were discussed to focus on monetizing (i.e., streamlining) LUMN. Two large (legacy) assets are in the process of being sold for approximately $10 billion, combined thereby eliminating some long-term higher interest rate debt. Not bad. The author of the article describes LUMN as focusing on a ""better growth profile"" by searching out fiber optic projects. That's not bad, either. On top of that, the $1 billion stock repurchase program makes a lot of sense at the current LOW stock price.If LUMN decided to trim the exceedingly generous yield of the dividend and use that money to either buy back stock or pay down debt, I'd be in favor of that. Why? Over time, the stock price would increase significantly."
"Active, what are your thoughts?"
"Buy on dips , Heading too 13-15 range next few weeks, opinion only g luck"
I am impressed with the $10b they managed to raise selling assets. Does anyone know the impact to sales? Seems the biggest hurdle with this company is growing sales when they have a leading edge offering (pardon the pun). I am seriously considering this investment now that they are less burdened with debt.
"Dividend will be paid out for about the next year imo. 8ish% not too bad.$1 B share buyback will retire close to 7.5% of shares depending on price. Not too bad.I would think the buyback could be done in a way to prevent the share price from dropping too much. That way we have a floor so to speak, and company buys shares cheap.After that, they'll have to prove they are a growth stock."
$20+ soon.
"I wish I knew more about the articles and press releases I see about LUMN success stories in dealing with security. To me, that sounds like an essential service, at various tiers, a massive fiber provider could offer as revenue streams. How significant is LUMN's role in providing top level security for its biggest clients? Is that a relevant growth area? Or is it just a small slice of overall future earnings?"
I'm lovin the heck out of LUMN.
"The only prospect worth staying in this stock for in the ""short term"" is the announcement that this God Forsaken Disaster of a publicly held company is finally sold lock, stock and barrel!"
"Gee, it would be SO NICE to see a $12 handle on this stock by end of day. Who knows...stranger things have happened (like how a demented senior got into the White House)."
"When will LUMN announce their next dividend and ex-dividend date, I haven't seen it yet?"
"We have been in direct contact with Cathie Wood, and it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE that the strong buying impetus could be her fund managers sniffing this carcass. If not, those two old Geezers in Omaha and Los Angeles respectively might finally be getting their whistles wet.Who wouldn't considering if these ""valuable assets"" were placed in the right hands to manage for ""significant profits"" and ""growth!"""
"I am a lumn investor at the start of last summer. Originally got in at 9.50 and sold out during each short squeeze and bought back in on the dips. With the latest news on the selling of assets that provided a whole lot of fcf and the impending divi cut I have decided to slowly close my position. I like and appreciate the new found focus on future growth plans, but the hole they are dug in is deeper now than ever with the dwendling free cash flow and the hill to a bustling fiber network is going to be a tough road to haul. AT&T is also struggling with their fiber rollout because of the massive shortages in the fiber supply itself. Lumn will also face mounting cost and delays trying to roll out their fiber. There maybe opportunities in the cloud and edge computing, but I don't really understand what those two things are and how they turn into revenue. So I try not to invest in things I don't really understand. At any rate. I am taking proceeds from lumn and have been investing in a small cap semiconductor NVEC. They've had a large pull back today so great buying opportunity. It has huge growth potential, a dividend nearing 6% and the fcf to back it up!"
"So just a back-of-the-envelope calculation: they sold the 7m copper connections to Apollo for a bit more than $1,000 per connection. The 16 states they are retaining have 21m connections with a better return profile (more dense, etc.) and may be worth $1,500 - $1,800 per connection. This implies a value for the retained 16 states of about $30bn - $36bn. Plenty of value under the hood here."

Why would they even consider a dividend cut when earnings easily cover it? are they doing the same as AT&T and trying to become a growth company by shedding older assets and reducing the dividend? Earnings were fantastic and by announcing a share buyback only shows they have extra cash to put to work.

Short volume was huge today. >9m vs avg 1.4m.Not sure what percentage of that was covering and new position
LUMN declares the Dividend
"All in all, LUMN is holding well considering the minor correction, across the board, today. An increase of a penny is better than a drop of several percentage points in these turbulent times.LUMN is really UNDERVALUED. It is my second largest position in my portfolio. I'm very happy with my decision to stay long on the company that is positioned perfectly for business reliance on the Internet. It can only go up in value because it owns the backbone of the Internet. Those many many thousands of fiber miles aren't going anywhere. And, it seems to me, there is real effort and evidence that monetizing what was once CenturyLink makes absolute sense. Refinancing overall debt makes perfect sense, too. Buying back shares at these low stock prices is good business. I look forward to the next inevitable dividend."
"Q2 call: The free cash flow stays great even after reduction due to the Apollo/LatAm sales, but they do reduce it enough that LUMN will be forced to make careful choices between network/territory expansion/upgrades, debt service/covenant compliance/paydowns, and dividends/buybacks, because comfortably addressing two of the three is easy but doing all three takes perfect execution and more customer demand than they seem to have right now. Their strategy seems to have been if you build it THEY will come, but it's been built for a while now and THEY haven't, in the droves needed at least. So a change in strategy has them scrabbling to grow their top line: through add-on services, a retreat from slower consumer fiber markets and doubling down on faster ones, a partial global retreat from LatAm - anything that monetizes the fiber faster with fatter margins (ditching copper was always the plan). The debt is just not a risk anymore but whatever minimally needs to be done there takes first priority. The talk on dividends in the call was solely about coverage ratios, not reducing it because they know that'll kill the stock price, so I doubt they will do that until they can convincingly sell the notion that whatever funds taken away from dividends are more lucratively spent on expansion; and they aren't anywhere close to that. Buybacks however buoy the stock price while reducing the cash needed for dividends so they will start doing that when they are insulted by the ticker; they seem flummoxed the market doesn't value the company the way they do, but that's what happens when management promises a lot and fails to deliver for a LONG TIME. I wonder whether buybacks, and management's nonchalance with a relatively high debt load they could continue to reduce if they wanted, betrays a bit of panic about a hostile takeover. Finally, management seems fully aware shareholders are fed up. The market reaction to all this seems fair to me because management keeps promising but not delivering and acting like they are fleet footed when they look like they are tap dancing. All that said, I think this could pay off richly but all eyes are on the top line, and Storey knows it and mentioned it often and emphatically. If they get traction on steadily growing revenues then the stock price should follow in lock step. Sadly that's been the story for a while, but the positives are they did get a handle on their debt, reduced interest rates, cut costs, improved margins, improved cash flows, and got rid of a lot of legacy business. So grow."
"The transaction will accomplish the following for Lumen: • Monetizes an attractive asset at ~9X the Latin American business' 2020 Estimated Adjusted EBITDA • Provides additional capital to enable Lumen to accelerate investments in key growth areas • Enables greater flexibility on capital allocation, allowing for debt reduction and the continued evaluation of share repurchases"

"Johnbadhands wrote this today:I am sure LUMN's assets will one day be in demand and critical. The problem is, where is the evidence that they will be able to extract any pricing power out of this? Look at their previous IRUs where they gave away their assets essentially for free. The risk of this happening again is certainly not zero, because all indications are that it is a buyer's market. Look at telecom that continue to pour billions into 3G, 4G, 5G while piling on debt - all of these services become essential but the translation into increased profits is weak. LUMN has established partnerships with a lot of massive companies but even lumped all together it's not moving the needle. Either demand remains anemic or they got hosed on the deals, or both. I'm also confused on what the continual endless capex spend is being used on. The edge is now reaching 97% of US enterprise. I was under the impression that they have ""future-proofed"" a lot of their buildout with empty conduits etc. Why not conserve capex at this point, buy back shares if the future is actually as inevitable as you say, and wait for the demand to actually show up before spending more? That is what a smart management team would do at this point."

If that clears the hurdle then why not buyback 50% at these ridiculous prices, it'd b cutting the div expense without cutting the shareholders throat ... again?EPS, PPS, short situation and company perception(etc) would all improve Dramatically!

"What am I missing?

"We purchased Global Crossing from Legere, but some of its wires crossing the globe and heading into LATAM are being SOLD. Can we RECRUIT John as our CEO in anticipation of The German Company, Deutsche Telekom, taking us over soon?https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/john-legere-of-t-mobile-ripped-up-your-wireless-contract/?src=A00220Legere spent 20 years at AT&T, including three-plus years as chief executive of AT&T Asia. But his real calling card was a decade at the initially troubled Asia Global Crossing, a fiber-optic-networking company. He put the firm into bankruptcy protection just months after he arrived, but rebuilt it. About 10 years later it was acquired for $3 billion.If he could salvage Global Crossing, could he do the same for T-Mobile? Now we know. Shares shot up more than 400% during his tenure running the company since it listed in 2013, trouncing the S&P 500's 63% gain. T-Mobile joined the top 5% of S&P 500 stocks with Legere at the helm, topping even Apple (AAPL).Fundamentals rocked, too. Adjusted earnings soared 1,727% from his first full year on the job in 2013 to $4.02 a share by 2019, his last full year. Revenue jumped 72% to $68.4 billion. And subscriber numbers roughly quadrupled, from roughly 30 million to 100 million by 2020. That's more than twice AT&T's growth rate and seven times Verizon's.If he could salvage Global Crossing, could he do the same for T-Mobile? Now we know. Shares shot up more than 400% during his tenure running the company since it listed in 2013, trouncing the S&P 500's 63% gain. T-Mobile joined the top 5% of S&P 500 stocks with Legere at the helm, topping even Apple (AAPL).Hire Mavericks Like John LegereLegere hired people willing to jump in and use their unique talents to tackle issues. And he rewarded them.When T-Mobile went public after its merger with MetroPCS in 2013, he insisted every employee get founder stock. Not options. Stock.When Deutsche Telekom objected to the estimated $250 million price tag, Legere insisted, saying ""I need every single one of these employees to be owners, not renters."" He won.Legere's management philosophy is simple: ""Ask the customers what they want and ask our people what's keeping us from doing it,"" Carey said.The best advice Legere ever received? ""When I lived in Asia, they used to say, 'If you're going to sing karaoke, go after the worst singer.' Words to live by.""John Legere's KeysTook over T-Mobile, a last-place mobile carrier, and increased its subscriber base, revenue and earnings as CEO from 2012 to 2020.Overcame: A poor reputation for the company and its industry.Lesson: ""How I have succeeded as a leader: Listen to your employees, listen to your customers, shut ... up and do what they tell you."""

takeover coming
"Folks As I recently posted Lumn at this Low price point and Tasty Compounding dividend, in ruffly 10 years you make your money back off Compounding dividend, obviously Lumn won’t stay in the 12s range , in fact Lumn should make a push to 15 - 18 range sooner then later, Buy , opinion only g luck"
"Selling off legacy non growth assets is great. But when you have declining revenue across the board, including core/“growth” products and segments, stock price suffers.This is a dead end company until they fix the top line."
Today I’ve been buying BRK.B under $277 with LUMN proceedsI’m going back to 100% Berkshire Hathaway. Walter Scott will be happy I’m holding a few shares of Lumen Technologies.
"Shares of Lumen Technologies (LUMN) have mostly been on the backfoot over the past few weeks following the company’s Q2 earnings. Investors have been concerned with the prospect of losing the payout of the largest dividend in the S&P 500. The company has said that after selling off some of its assets, it plans to push ahead with investments in fiber upgrades which could potentially force it to cut its dividend."
"The Lumen trap, assume the future is a T-Mobile takeover. So we wait for that to happen collect an 8% dividend to keep us interested then merge. But at what price? If T-Mobile is the only bidder then it seems to me there will be a small premium paid. If this is the future then hopefully they sell more assets at a market premium and that cash is set aside for a larger premium for the balance of the assets that T-Mobile wants."
"Laugh if you want...but today's trading was very fishy. Huge lopsided Bid over Ask, then contrary to normal trading it suddenly *drops* two or three cents. And of course when the reverse occurs (lopsided Ask over Bid) it would also decline as one would expect."
"Now we're really on our way with more asset sales!<< Lumen Technologies to Sell U.S. Telecom Assets to Apollo for $7.5 Billion, Company Officials SayBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 4:01 PM ET 08/03/2021Lumen Technologies Inc. ( LUMNplans to sell a broad swath of its U.S. telecommunications network to Apollo Global Management Inc. ( APOfor $7.5 billion including debt, officials from the companies said.The investment giant will carve out some of Lumen's so-called incumbent local exchange carrier assets, a collection of telephone and broadband infrastructure that covers 6 million residential and business customers across 20 states, mostly in the U.S. Midwest and Southeast. The deal value includes $1.4 billion of assumed debt."
"A couple things to keep in mind: They sold the weak half of their ILEC business (20 states) at a 5.5 multiple. The 16 states they kept have a much better return profile and would clearly fetch a higher multiple. Same can probably be said of their LATAM sale at 9x versus the US and European assets. These transactions do clearly imply a higher valuation multiple for the retained assets.It sounds like they may not be done with rationalizing the portfolio. Let's see what else drops.The potential income from new fiber installs in the retained areas is big. 15 million potential subs and possible 40% - 50% capture would be a huge income. Sure they will invest a bunch to get there, but will only do so if it makes sense.Any divi cut would be temporary to support this new investment, but once complete we have a new and more sustainable cash cow again.I believe that institutional buyers will realize this soon and start buying. Today's selloff was irrational and misguided - in my opinion. Could be wrong though?"

"revenues keep falling, company keeps shrinking, share price goes lower"
"Anyone know who's fiber this could be? - T-Mobile has quietly started selling fiber-based home internet, as tipped to T-Mo Report and confirmed by the company to The Verge. T-Mobile says it’s testing fiber optic internet in certain residential buildings in Manhattan as a complement to its fixed wireless offering, which it made available to the public in April. The company isn’t deploying an entirely new fiber network for the pilot; it’s running on a local provider’s fiber lines.Details on the dedicated T-Mobile Fiber site are thin, but it claims the service offers 940Mbps upload and download speeds. A Wi-Fi 6 router is included, along with chat and e-mail customer support for fiber customers. A T-Mobile rep had no other details to share with us, just that the program is a “very limited pilot” and more information would be shared “when and if” it becomes more widely available."
"Insider buying... Director ""Steven Clontz"" bought nearly $60,000.00 worth of Lumen stock, 20 days ago. Follow the money!"
Lumen not invited to cyber security summit in DC?
People chillax. This is one of the highest paying dividend stocks of the s&p 500. Lots of dividend etfs hold this. Any mention of dividend cut will set off the trading algorithms. There is more value here than the current share price reveals. Let the froth settle or if you are bold take advantage of the sale going one. I never understand why people can’t wait to buy stocks when over priced and run away from a discount.
Added at 11.70 and 11.50
Lumen is up 4.93% to 12.56
"I bought lumen last December at 9.90/s for 10.1% yield. I also sold covered calls at 12 to juice my yield by another $1/s. As I have monitored the board over the past 9 or so months, all of the #$%$ and moaning was that lumen had too much debt and a declining business. Well for f?s sake why are we not ecstatic. I just read the entire call transcript. Lumen is getting out of the old copper line in a bunch of rural states and out of the Latina America segment. A ton of cash to deleverage, unloading old declining market and investing in future growth. And now the market doesn?t like getting what it has asked for? Will dividends get cut in the future? Probably by some amount, but the old model was like a finite annuity. The new lumen is more like a going concern. Don?t panic now and collect those dividends for another quarter while sanity returns. I don?t have the balls to buy more shares now but I will buy back my options so this isn?t called away when sanity returns. Now, will someone with true knowledge tell me where my logic is wrong."

"Excerpt from CTL's Q3 2013 ER, (over $18B Annual Revs?)""From our business market perspective, we experienced strong new sales to business customers for network and hosting services during the quarter. And also in the quarter we made strong progress on the share repurchase program we announced in February, through November 5th this year we repurchased 38 million shares or 6.1% of our outstanding common stock totaled approximately $1.3 billion.""""We have repurchased shares aggressively since the start of the program and we expect to opportunistically buyback additional shares going forward. Due to combination of dividend and share repurchases we return over $2.2 billion to shareholders through the first three quarters of the year, that’s a 63% increase compared to approximately $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2012.""Different Storey these days ehh?"
"Volume question. Can someone explain why at the end of the day Friday the volume was about 10 million shares at the close of the market, but when I check today, it shows the volume double at about 20 million shares. Is this because of after hours trading? If so, what would such a large volume increase portent for the stock price this coming Monday? Were these after market shares a buy or a sell? Probably no way to tell. Thanks."
What's up with LUMN this week? Are investors banking on Congress's infrastructure bill stimulating windfall profits for companies like LUMN?
"In our opinion Andrews was a non event this morning. He reiterated Covid 19 continues to be a headwind for CTO decision makers, and the rest of his 40 minute commentary was a review of block, tackle and run methods which are hoping to produce sales greater than the legacy losses.Market makers are moving the stock in unusual fashion in spite of the non event including a Hotel win PR. We can only hope a lock, stock and barrel SALE of this 23 year nightmare is imminent."
Lot of moving parts. Hard to discern. Big moves with asset sales and moving of debt.. Need one quarter to sort out.. May take a couple more quarters to sort out. Must see growth after that or face acquisition.
looks like takeover to me
"Based on price action and volume spikes in today's trading, I would guesstimate we had 'repurchases'(1-2M shares?) today?If we move down at the EOD, I think that strengthens my 'guess' because of 10b-18 rules?"

Did people even read the transcript? They are not faced with the trade off of removing the dividend. Will continue to give dividend and start share buybacks. Shorts last chance to cover

Lumen hit $12.89 in the after-market. Will we cross the $13 line tomorrow? CNN Pre-market futures has already selected $LUMN as a gainer before the opening bell.
bought 130 shares AH yesterday at 11.37 when the dividend news dropped. Now up to 800 total.So far so good.
Another fat dividend coming. Too bad all weak hands who could not interpret earnings call sold thinking a dividend cut was coming. So wrong. Next couple quarters will also have same dividend. Now back up we go above $13.
Prolonged and delayed decision making since COVID persists.
Great company - reducing debt fast. It may get bought out by the big boys but I just hope they have to pay up for it big time. Say 50 and change.
"With quadruple witching hour upon us, a break above $13 beyond five cents over will be very positive and a line drawn in the sand against the short side of the table. We want those shares called away from the ""sellers"" and the ""buying impetus"" it creates inside the brokerage houses back offices. If not, they still have a stranglehold on our shares. And, we all know that Jeff is not going to do anything about it next Wednesday!"
