Down another 'dividend' in value today. Storey...where ya at??
Big jump is happening. Hold on to your seats!
"Thinning out Lumen positionOriginally bought as high dividend value play. Since it is changing focus significantly, deserves a revaluation. Recent sales of business segments sounded promising as assets were sold off at good metrics. Selling off a lot of near term cashflow. Problem is that company is threatening to waste proceeds on new ""growth"" markets. Company has no real track record in growth. Would much prefer if proceeds were used to either paydown debt or buyback stock. While company tries to paint new investments as an extension of its business, it appears to be moving into more dynamic growth areas from a high cashflow no growth utility telecom/networking business. The businesses it is moving toward are not bad businesses. The problem is that I have no faith in current management being able to make the switch. If I want to invest in these businesses, I would prefer a management team with a track record of success. In general, I am in a reducing market exposure mode and therefore am looking more for what to trim than what to acquire.Msg 177341 of 177341 at 9/22/2021 10:34:19 AM by Zver1"
"Could someone explain this to me? I understand calls and puts and that a sweep is a large purchase or sale.Regarding LUMN (NYSE:LUMN), we observe a call option sweep with bearish sentiment. It expires in 63 day(s) on November 19, 2021. Parties traded 491 contract(s) at a $13.00 strike. This particular call needed to be split into 36 different trades to become filled. The total cost received by the writing party (or parties) was $34.7K, with a price of $69.0 per contract. There were 7298 open contracts at this strike prior to today, and today 597 contract(s) were bought and sold."

my my see how easy it is.
"Yesterday's high 12.29, today's low 12.30....might not qualify as a ""filled gap."" Was denken Sie? History says today just another series of false starts and mishaps courtesy of a CEO who remains a DISASTER at ""selling"" crucial, essential, non negotiable, non discretionary, greatly demanded ""internet communication"" services!"
"Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) saw some choppy midday trading and is now holding steady down 2.5% after a positive shout from Gilman Hill's Jenny Harrington on CNBC's Halftime Report.After a deep reassessment last week of its original investment thesis, the firm is still in the same bullish place: ""The fiber assets are hugely valuable and underappreciated,"" she says.Management is at an inflection point where they're really trying to unlock the value of those assets, she says, adding ""We think that it's probably trading at about 50% of what its private market value equivalent would be.""Lumen trading volume today of 10.8 million shares is just short of surpassing its average full-day volume of 11.18 million shares.The shares have declined 24% from a summer high of $15.45.And that means forward dividend yield is sitting at 8.24%. Check out Seeking Alpha's Dividend Scorecard for LUMN."
Pretty critical support in the 11.96-7 area.....its right there
"Q3 2021 Earnings report for Lumen Technologies, Inc. will be on November 03 @ 5:00 PM ET."
Is this a friendly or hostile.... you know what... [that word]?
It is all good. Either an acquisition or a move to the up side oncethe 2 deals close for the Latin American business and the 20 local exchanges. They total over S10 billion ....Smaller more focused company with high growth prospects or part of a larger entity at a premium.
"Bought more at these levels, can't go wrong with 8% dividend payout, lol"
The next SI snapshot (for mid-month) is still a few days away but Fintel shows over 17.47M SV over the period covered(1st to 15th)... wonder how many were 'covered'? 92.29M shares were 'owed' on the EOM August `21 SI count.PPS Still up from the $11.91 open on 'x'(8/27) and up nicely on the last 1 year chart! Anyone else buy in the $8's? ;)
"That U.S. Postal Service contract is a strong buy signal if there ever was one for $LUMN. Add to it the +.25 cent per share quarterly dividend, and you have a duck on a pond with this investment."
"On this day of huge across the board gains, literally nearly every stock across my screens was displayed in green... except for this red holdout. All of the other stocks in my portfolio went up over two percentage points... some hit gains of over 5%... except this ONE. It makes me wonder why I should stay long with LUMN. I have not yet seen any evidence of significant strategic goals that will lead to significant gains. As a leader of fiber optic miles that make up the backbone of the Internet for North America, I'd expect more.Or, there is that notion of being bought out by another company... on the cheap. What is going on?"
"There’s a Whale or two out there eyeing Lumn , too many key assets to ignore, Lumn is ready to cycle back into wall street favor, looks like the only thing passing in Washington will be the 1.5 infrastructure bill for real infrastructure items, Lumn will roll…Buy now lock in under 13 great compounding dividend.. opinion only g luck"

"As far as the sale of our US assets to Apollo, I see benefits AND costs but hey that's just my 'limited' point of view. It would seem to me that those 'big picture guys' would consider the Long-Term loss of not just assets but loss of potential Growth in those areas? Edge comes to mind, altho down the road, IT IS on the road.(not in 20 states 4 Lumn?) It appears management thinks ST bennys outweigh LT losses? Needing $7 or $8 Billion for investment in FTT-X to Current Customers? Why not take advantage of Government Contracts (65B?) You've needed to build or upgrade those areas anyway? At least try... when/if they get(go) passed the House(s)! ha Evidently Enterprise is ALL that matters to management!Q1 ER vs Q2 ER are like different Companies! I knew they were exploring all options, just thought they wanted More!All of a sudden they seem 'desperate' to complete the 'transformation' to a much 'smaller' corporation w/less Revs!More like Storey's other story w/o divs? I guess there's still time? (Time is determined by T=D/R ?) Says Lumen...""5ms radius Lumen Edge Computing nodes are designed to meet 98% of the U.S. enterprise and public sector demand within 5ms of latency, enabling you to run next-gen applications smoothly and efficiently by linking your sites from the Premises Edge to the Metro Edge to the Cloud Core.""Hey, Don't bother, Believe me I know all the 'BUTs'! lol EOR (end of rant)"
"Article written AGAIN about Lumen being a value trap, and down she goes. The shorts have controlled the narrative for a long long time and the CEO's and good ole boys just play along and collect shares along the way. Time for a change at the top!"
"Comcast is coming out with its own Software for a new Smart TV, selling at Walmart, Interesting twist"
Good entry below $12. Back in again. Have only held for dividend capture and short term capital gains. Stock never seems to break out but moves in a pretty reliable trading range.

"VRS indicated he puts on the headset googles when taking the fam to the snap card office. he indicated the DHS office is way better experience using metaverse tools. he sugggests the office may have LUMN fiber line. does this info help you. gee, i hope so. meanwhile, weekend is here and ample time apartment clean up."
Shoulda woulda coulda …you could have loaded up under 12 last weekSo now load up Under 13 while you canLumn going to 15-17 soon opinion only g luck
this meager slide is not enough to interest me. market makers will have to do alot better.
"South Korean laws are different than those in the US and the entire socialistic (and elitist Silicon Valley) politics around Net Neutrality in the US will fully preclude such a legal ruling from having any affect in the US (or Europe imo). The Dems are so beholden to the monopolies of Silicon Valley (Google, Apple, Facebook, Netflix, etc.) which benefit from NOT PAYING internet usage fees that their is ZERO possibility of Lumen getting fully value from its network under a Democrat admin or controlled Congress. It was hard enough trying to make progress to reverse the net neutrality rules when the Republicans controlled both houses and the White House...that any attempt to do so now is doomed to failure."
"giving LUMN credit where credit due: expected a fall back from 11.95 for my opening tranche, as ive done for some time. not this quarter. Jeff may be on to me. he retires soon and sits on the board. maybe he'll decide to give me a break so i can start cashing bigger checks and keep my single wide lights on."
takeover coming. I have been saying this for month
"A substantial buyback at these prices will change 'perceptions' and would create more value for the Company & Shares!But, can they? Shorts laughed at the paltry $1B over two years when 'they sell' that much every 3 or 4 months and actually owe more than that at current SP and SI (about 20% more ($1.2B))! In 4 short yrs, From #2 to a 'WHAT???'! ;("
KarlDieGlatze is Anfuhrer on twits.
The stock keeps going down but why please explain
This stock should be trading around $20.00.
I sold calls at $14 12 days ago for $0.25 expiring Nov 5th.Have a buy to close order to see if I can buy the calls back for $0.05. Amazing if I can do that every month and collect 4 divi's per year ..Of course there's the impeding divi cull.
Fair value should be around 17$. I also think this stock is about to pop.
takeover looming
"11.80 or so is where this can park all next week. sell to open gone and i'm pleased. did the two stand up solvent guys at twits help. duh. karldieglatz saw me grab the ring and he's fretting away in his bowl of gruel.

Lumen Technologies nabs ~$196M Defense IT contract check out seeking alpha for the article
This company is selling for about 1/4 of what it costs to put the fiber in the ground. Then add $10b in cash + IP+Good Will+CF. Seems very cheap with a real possibility of sale growth (finally) now that they are focused. My experience is a stock generally goes up when company announces it is buying its own stock.
Maybe will get some good news on USPS Income at the Earnings Call
Unsustainable Dividend 
"I will have to do an update in the coming weeks to share the latest news, especially the EXCEPTIONAL GOOD ONE of the contract with the US Postal Service (USPS). I'm very happy to have Lumen as the LARGEST position in my MILLION DOLLARS PORTFOLIO (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)https://youtu.be/44sWq7gGqn4"

looks like takeover to me
"Is the reason Lumen isn’t getting more awards for government contracts, due to their network still having a lot of Huawei gear?Among that response you mentioned: “last I heard, the ""legacy"" Level 3 network contains alot of Huawei kit: if that's still the case, given that Huawei's big push is to have the West buy more of its equipment, I think Level 3/LUMN would be low on the list of China's retaliation targets.” Is this still the case? Do you know the limits of Huawei gear in telecom and Lumen specifically? I’ve read clear statements by Verizon that they don’t use any Huawei stuff. And two things I have read on this were that most telecom providers didn’t either: “None of the US’s ""big four"" wireless carriers—AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile—use Huawei equipment, Huawei executive Tim Danks confirmed earlier this year. (2019 - ed) Neither do cable internet providers Comcast or Charter.“ And more recently, the article referenced by thinkith showed a clip where England is replacing Huawei stuff with Nokia components, and then this statement: “The U.K. government has banned installation of Huawei’s 5G equipment in the country as of this month, and has demanded operators remove all of such equipment by 2027.“ So my question: if Lumen still has a lot of Huawei gear in their network, is that holding back any award of any government contracts?"
just be patient ladies & Gentlemen.best Inflation hedge with good growth chances. just hold.
The story keeps getting better and better for LUMN. Big upside reval coming.
when are the next divi's being paid out? also what's the cut off?
What time is the farmer telling his storey today?
CSCO and LUMN joint venture ?
"Johnbadhands wrote this today:I am sure LUMN's assets will one day be in demand and critical. The problem is, where is the evidence that they will be able to extract any pricing power out of this? Look at their previous IRUs where they gave away their assets essentially for free. The risk of this happening again is certainly not zero, because all indications are that it is a buyer's market. Look at telecom that continue to pour billions into 3G, 4G, 5G while piling on debt - all of these services become essential but the translation into increased profits is weak. LUMN has established partnerships with a lot of massive companies but even lumped all together it's not moving the needle. Either demand remains anemic or they got hosed on the deals, or both. I'm also confused on what the continual endless capex spend is being used on. The edge is now reaching 97% of US enterprise. I was under the impression that they have ""future-proofed"" a lot of their buildout with empty conduits etc. Why not conserve capex at this point, buy back shares if the future is actually as inevitable as you say, and wait for the demand to actually show up before spending more? That is what a smart management team would do at this point."
10% of float still short. What are they thinking?
"FYI....the only thing TALIJOE will get done is a 1.5 infrastructure bill, which actually includes 10%plus for Broadband roads bridges etc, Lumn UNDER 12 with the HUGE COMPOUNDING dividend is a steal, BUY BUY BUY, opinion only g luck"
"""Lumen has cloud partnerships in place with the likes of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle, and Amazon Web Services. Due to its large fiber network, Lumen can reach 98% of the enterprises in the U.S., Europe and some Latin American countries with a low latency of 5 milliseconds one way with its edge compute nodes."" So many partnerships, so much coverage, such low latency....and revenue continues to fall off a cliff. Not interested in PR fluff - wake me up when the numbers start going up."
"This is not a rumor: USPS Selects Lumen for Network Modernization Contract-Postal Service (USPS) to strengthen and modernize its network services that support more than 32,000 post offices and mail processing sites around the country."
Any comments on Metaverse and its impact on LUMN?
"She said it's trading at ""50 percent of what its Private Market Value Equivalent would be."" Twenty four-twenty five dollars if it were a ""private company?"" But Buffett bought PRIVATE COMPANIES and their stingy multiples even when the businesses were suffering from even stingier multiples so that he could bring them into the PUBLIC MARKET at THREE TIMES or MORE their PRIVATE MULTIPLES.What a JOKE this Company remains."
Can anyone offer info on the pricing changes of dark-fiber?
Newbie to Lumen as I like the deal with CSCO & what I see in the pre. Took a bite at $12.25.
Knocking on the 13 door again!!If we can go through that door maybe this will finally make its move to 15!!
I miss those not-too-long-ago days when we had .40 and .50-cent UP days.
Eat it shorts!!
"With the passage of time, unsubstantiated hyperbole, especially when presented with great fanfare, is not positive! On the contrary, it's another nefarious 'short' option tactic used to create irrational exuberance in the near-term!The usps is positive, Covering Shorts may provide a bump, buybacks help... but we all know, for a sustained upward move, rev losses have to reverse!"
"I think back to 2012 or so and remember CTL being compared to WIN and FTR and judged to have 'not enough Fiber'.Then in `17, Patel said ""no.3 buys no.4 and becomes no.2"", comparing CTL to T and VZ.

I noticed on the Q2 ER(8/3) ONE thing was up ~110%!! y/y, Share-based Compensation Expense! lol"
is this a time to load up or wait and see what happens
This is soo cheap right now If I had 13B I would buy it all up ! Every time they knock it down just buy some more its probably over 12% short as it is.
takeover
"be mindful, when this tumbles a few pennies the ""takeover"" blah commences. ignore the amateurs. they're broke and await another stimulus."
what was the best thing Storey spun yesterday?
Couldn’t imagine what it’s like paying an 8% dividend plus your interest payments while holding your short position

"Sideways for 6 months, getting to be time to gap up!"

"I am focused on CSCO and LUMN partnering on many fronts, there may be fore shadowing happening."
Why the 4% jump? No news to back it up.
$16 Jan 1st.
Surprised to see the after-hours pop to $12.20. What’s that all about?!?
I ask again... Is Temasek ownership a problem for share repurchase and retirement of >100M or so shares?
Short interest dropped by 2m from end of Sept to mid-Oct. Did we feel it?Represents 8.6% of float.
WE calculate a $40MM run rate for this service at 100 percent penetration meaning ten percent to Lumen or $4MM per year maximum revenues. EOM
12.75. 13 next
anything close to .90 and best and brightest retail know the regular drill here. will catch those sell to opens by friday. that would be as nice as another package from harbor freight.
Down another 'dividend' in value. ???
webr thinks everyone is his 'son'. Yet we all know he's never dated anyone other than Rosy Palm. :)
"a little concerning, down 5 days in a row, down on a big green market day, missed earnings expected. I don't know. Might bail briefly and return for divi's after earnings in November"
"Folks, the only thing passing under talijoe is 1.5 infrastructure bill, which actually goes mostly towards Real infrastructure projects, not the 3.5 wish list open bar of the blue demos,So no doubt when the bi partisan 1.5 passes, Lumn will see a bump to 15-20 range, and as everyone Knows If not enjoy the nice healthy Compounding dividend until the stock price pops, Last chances to own Under 13, lock and load up on Lumn plus Compounding Dividend Opinion only g luck"

"Active....KUDOS to you for your series of posts this morning. If we swapped out $5MM into BABA this morning, they would surely take Baba down, and Lumen up. There is an inner eye at the brokerage level that is there to seek and destroy the wealth of minnows around their table versus the WEALTH which they CONTROL.Lumen would still rise like a Phoenix from the Ashes and be uncontainable if the Billion Dollar Sales Contracts annually, not over ten years hit the wires enough times sooner rather than later, however. Think about the frustrated Apple shareholders who bailed in the late nineties or the wiped out Amazon shareholders in early 2K. Thing about Lumen and its predecessor, though, is the length of time for proving their SUCCESS is far from being reasonable--multi decades--and many will grow white hair and whiskers including many who will die before he it pays off. That's no way to ""invest."""
"when it nears 11's, second tranche. for those long on fiat you know the regular drill. covered calls start in holiday months, nov/dec. lather, rinse, repeat."
"Lumen Technologies declares quarterly cash dividendDENVER, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) today announced that its Board of Directors voted to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share. The dividend is payable September 10, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2021. The ex-dividend date will be August 27, 2021."
12.75 is key
it's not dividend day is it?
"The Lumen CEO needs to go, he is out of his league, everything he touches is tainted by the incompetence he has put on full display since the day he told LVLT shareholders that merging with Lumen would produce a transformational tech company with surging revenues. The proxy put out for the combination of CTL & LVLT said 28 billion in revenue for 2020. It missed the mark by 30%. It was partially authored and certainly embraced by the NOW Lumen CEO. Maybe he didn't DO due diligence like one would expect from a CEO who tells his shareholders a deal is a GOOD move?! Wall Street has been on to this incompetence from the get go and all of their analysis has played out in real time since the deal closed. This then became a momentum play when it was clear that trust had been broken in the early days of the current CEO telling tall tails about divy sustainability, cutting of unprofitable revenue, enterprise, enabling the 4th industrial revolution, low latency, edge and now mass market opportunities in the footprint retained in the recent Apollo deal... The incompetence has remained on full display as it would appear the plan has been formulated and changes quarterly with a dartboard being the main determining factor.. To be crystal clear. I believe the assets have value. That being said, the numerous articles and comments for the past 3-4 years supporting Lumen at a much higher valuation have ALL ignored the same thing. They have ignored the outsized role played by Lumen leadership and these multigenerational lows in PPS. Current leadership needs to be retired or replaced through sale of the company for shareholder to reap the benefits of these assets. Going on 4 years, how anyone can still believe in current leadership is beyond me."
"Looking back to 'x' day(8/27) the stock opened at $11.91(minus the .25 div), it closed at $11.97 and did that twice more by 9/10.

"Lumen Technologies Inc. (LUMN)Our price objective is $8 based on a 4.5x 2021E EV/EBITDA multiple. This is a discount to AT&T and Verizon due to slower growth and higher leverage.Downside risks to our PO are increased competition from wireless, cable, and enterprise service providers and LVLT deal integration. Upside risks are faster than expected revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow growththis is from the BofA analyst. These morons are also advisors to LUMN on both their recent announced deals.

"Check out Seeking Alpha's article, comparing LUMN to Gogent. They show a clear path to higher earnings through Streaming and much higher valuations. 11-20-2021, "" LUMN could be Gogent in 5 years """
"T/VZ/LumnT and VZ at 52 week lows, TMUS down 20% from its 52 wk high and about to have a death cross on its chart, CHTR and CMCSA both falling significantly. Looks like the sector is in for some tough sledding going forward. I'm actually quite surprised Lumen has not dropped more. Maybe its coming, but the depressed valuation and the multiples on the recent sales must be holding it up. Unless there has been a change in the Enterprise business that we have not seen yet though this seems unlikely. With the bearish tone towards all these companies, does anyone expect anything positive to come out of the next earnings release? At this point, I just can't see it. by cafly2001"
Cheaper stock for takeover? This sudden drop makes it look like an engineered discount. I will hold.

"Zacks report today says Lumen Technologies is an inspired choice for value investors (with caveats, of course)"
"Is it possible that Lumen sells itself entirely like some long suffering owners continue begging for, and before we create a position at lower pricing points after the dividend is cut as we expect? Not possible until after they remove the ""poison pill"" one might think, and that can't happen until they use up the NOL's which won't happen until the two sales are consummated....if they're consummated....as long as the month of December, 2022, or still 14 months away. This Storey really does STINK the way this management team has sacrificed equity owner for their own benefit, doesn't it!"
"Lumen path forward with FTTH is more like FTTE. Focus on bringing more enterprises on-net, not residences. Shifting away takes time.In the meantime, they are also clearly putting effort into improving customer experience for portions of their net servicing mostly retail customers and SMB if anything to gain value with a potential acquirer who can win-win service them better and at a profit per relatively small ARPU and large churn. Can't help losing the enterprise customers in that mix, for now. Maybe win them back with future FTTE."
"The problem with this stock, other than poor execution by Storey, is he has left a major overhang on this stock with these divestures in not only how long they are going to take to close(way too long) but what the company is going to look like afterwards....nobody freaking knows."
"Lumen IS an infrastructure play... nice chart, too with the EMA(21) just now crossing over the SMA(50)..."

"Whether the two assets sell or not, the Company remains a FCF Machine in anticipation of what can clearly be states as ""closer than ever"" exponential top line growth.

"I was under the impression that Lumen has built/acquired one of the most expansive and future-proof low-latency fiber networks in the country that reaches 98%+ of businesses. I was also under the impression that the edge compute buildout is nearing completion and also reaches a similar percentage of enterprise. What do they keep spending capex on? They can carry on their FTTH buildout with their previous microtargeting strategy rather than going crazy at a time when there are multiple downgrades and an apparent pricing war brewing. This is the perfect time to reign in spending, clean up your balance sheet even more and focus on shareholder return. Look at the how the oil and gas industry suffered for years due to overbuild and oversupply. But as soon as their existence was threatened they started to cut supply, shelve projects and direct cash flow to debt paydown and share buybacks. Look at what's happening with commodities going through the roof due to structural undersupply and several companies 10x from their lows. A similar thing happened in the semiconductor industry where the big players managed their supply and have now created a strong pricing environment on their way to record revenues and profits. There is a lesson to be learned here, but it looks like the telecom industry is run by a bunch of dinosaurs who don't understand the basics of supply and demand. by johnbadhands"
Where is Active on this down day?......I need to know the sky is blue
"It looks suspicious that the direction of LUMEN seems to make itself easier to be purchased as a company with the simple focus of having huge assets in terms of fiber in the ground. It's shed its legacy operations, based on its Louisiana roots of being a voracious rural telco. It's lightened up its overseas operations. What does that leave? It's a big bow on top of a present.Good possible news: If correct, LUMEN is worth much more as a bid-up asset for future-thinking corporations. If so, expect a doubling in the coming quarter or two when a bidding war is announced. If just one potential buyer, it should go up by half. Again, if this happens, in that process, ""shorts"" will lose their shorts."
I am told the reason for the downgrade issued on the last day of the quarter was the company wanted to buy back another 3.5 million shares before close of quarter at around $12.50 or under. BoA is assisting in the buyback.
"This whole thread is about edge computing. In that context 5ms refers to the time it takes light to travel from an edge compute location to a user. And the part of the network mostly traversed is the access network. Not the long haul network. Depending on where Lumen has placed the edge nodes it is possible that some long haul fiber is traversed, but extremely unlikely. As such that press release holds little to no relevance to the edge compute service."
Storey takes a brutal beating on the SA message boards.
Lumen hit $12.89 in the after-market. Will we cross the $13 line tomorrow? CNN Pre-market futures has already selected $LUMN as a gainer before the opening bell.
Everyone on the planet is raising their bottom line prices to combat the sick inflationary disease befalling mankind at this time while Jeff can only raise his expense line especially wages union and non union as well as supplies(cogs) being increased at the same time “Lowering” his prices to deliver services because he has “no pricing power.”It’s an expression of a linear line to six dollars per share before pre-packaged bankruptcy.His charitable network contributions are leading the great strides for empowering The Fourth Industrial Revolution.
I guess the storey telling is not going well....it is going the wrong way.
"Storey said, ""So we don't generally provide forecasts on trends in the market"" I wonder why, it couldn't be that all their internal forecasts have turned out to be completely wrong, could it? Funny how they rush to do all these buildouts while the demand lags way, way behind. Imagine if the capex was controlled and the extra money went to debt reduction and buybacks. And it looks like the lesson hasn't really been learned as all indications are they are prepping for a massive capex binge once the sales close.Talk about how important the dividend is but cut it (soon to be twice). Talk about how debt ratio is important but freeze reductions in place of capex Talk about how shares are undervalued, but announce a puny buyback program far too late, and refuse to even say if shares were bought during the post-earnings plunge. Back when Apple was undervalued and regularly getting beaten down for no good reason, management would put out press releases announcing that they took advantage of the dip and bought back a ton of shares. It would generally have an immediate stabilizing effect on the shares, and you can see the long term results. If only Lumen had similar competent management that looked out for shareholders."
Need to go back to 15.
Must be kinda tough on the 'div skippers'? Lumn's Up from the $11.91 open on 'x' day (plus the div cash 4 some).;)
100 Million Shorts Going to have to Buy to COVER
"LUMN has a lot of potential in my opinion.The dividend rate is great too.I am in this one for the long run!!!Just increased my position today a bit. Still at a loss but I am hopeful that the Cloud Business and the work for the USPS improves the bottomline.They need to sell the underperforming segments to Apollo, I have a position with Apollo as well.Fiber is the backbone of 5G, that is what interested me in the company from the beginning. They have a lot of fiber miles."
"that's all folks, for Wednesday. nearing 12, if and when, tomorrow, or friday, and it's ITM sell to opens. maybe two weeks out. you can all give me advice on how much you care. bless your hearts."
"I like that leadership is tackling debt, focusing on core business, and that the world will continue to need fiber as demand for the online world grows. I bought today, wished it was on Friday. Oh well, I am long term now."
"Lumen should be able to say to their customers, ""we have to raise our prices,"" or ""we can no longer provide the valuable services"" our network costs require us to charge you.That's called ""pricing power,"" and results in a necessary business moat for building quality, long lasting employee jobs as well as common shareholder wealth earned for by investment in creating the business model benefitting the customers who demand it because they need the product since without it, their quality of lives would be lessoned in time, money, and inconvenience. Raise your prices, Jeff. I dare you!"
Bought some more I just can’t help it
"Volume question. Can someone explain why at the end of the day Friday the volume was about 10 million shares at the close of the market, but when I check today, it shows the volume double at about 20 million shares. Is this because of after hours trading? If so, what would such a large volume increase portent for the stock price this coming Monday? Were these after market shares a buy or a sell? Probably no way to tell. Thanks."
Generating $10b in cash and becoming a pure play - does this make LUMN a buyout target to someone who can grow the business?
"Question; The company has a number of open job postings, would this not be a sign of a growing company?"
Goldman Sachs presentation tomorrow.... Will we get news?
takeover coming
Looks like all those 'calls' at $12.50 are gone!
"Some people talking 'bout ""I'm Long so They should payoff more debt because that'd make the Company easier to sell and buybacks don't!!?? $100's soon unless we sell at $30 in two years!!?? huh??"

Anyone know if LUMN is restricted from buying back shares for a period before earnings announcement? Seems the pattern has changed recently which might help explain the recent weakness?

"Lumen volume jumps as CNBC analyst sees big upside in fiber assetsOct. 27, 2021 2:04 PM ETLumen Technologies, Inc. (LUMN)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor1 CommentLumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) saw some choppy midday trading and is now holding steady down 2.5% after a positive shout from Gilman Hill's Jenny Harrington on CNBC's Halftime Report.After a deep reassessment last week of its original investment thesis, the firm is still in the same bullish place: ""The fiber assets are hugely valuable and underappreciated,"" she says.Management is at an inflection point where they're really trying to unlock the value of those assets, she says, adding ""We think that it's probably trading at about 50% of what its private market value equivalent would be.""Lumen trading volume today of 10.8 million shares is just short of surpassing its average full-day volume of 11.18 million shares.The shares have declined 24% from a summer high of $15.45.And that means forward dividend yield is sitting at 8.24%.

"FYI… Shortys have to be aware that with all the good news with Lumn assets sales and overall numbers getting better, there recent beat down of Lumn is overThere are far better companies to short now then Lumn A few more Big volume and trading days sustained by Lumn will force Shortys to Buy back as well as Big Buyers are starting to come in Lumn all equals Lumn is heading fast to and thru 15 right up to 20 soon, especially when the 1.5 infrastructure bill passes , which is all that’s going to happen before 2022, no way the 3.5 open bar deal ever happensBuy Lumn under 13 last chance load up lock in on Huge compounding dividend, own it in ruffly 10 yrs or less off dividend alone return original investment… opinion only g luck"
"with amzn and aapl doing what they do perhaps more fiat moves to my staples and even lumn. of course bots at citadel don't think like me. who, does."
"Re: quantum fiber salesDon't you think a company that would buy Lumen would audit the books? Sham sales never look good on the books because it looks like the company is trying to inflate income. Much like when Qwest had their salespeople go out and make all sorts of deals to get business and then those orders got canceled. In the end, an audit revealed they were only recording the sales, not the canceled orders which led Joe Nacchio to the federal slammer and the shareholders becoming bagholders, much like the people who swallowed Walter Scott's advice to hold their shares and they would be happy. All the while he was selling his shares in Level 3. - by slnter64"
