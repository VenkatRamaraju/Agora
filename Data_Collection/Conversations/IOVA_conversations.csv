"H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis reiterated a Buy rating on Iovance Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ:IOVA) Inc on Monday, setting a price target of $50"
"The management team at IOVA seems to be judiciously managing the company and positioning it for a buyout or alternatively, a large spike in valuations as new indications begin to be introduced for the TIL technology. I have little doubt the upward trajectory for this company is just beginning. Btw, a strong market today doesn't hurt!!!"
"They intend to offer and sell $500M of common stock, subject to market and other conditions, in an underwritten public offering. The use of the proceeds from this offering will fund the expansion of its organisation to support the potential commercial launch of Lifileucel for anti-PD-1 R/R advanced melanoma and LN-145 for advanced cervical cancer, to initiate a program directed at registration of TIL therapies in NSCLC, to continue support of ongoing commercial manufacturing activities, and for the development of IL-2 analog, IOV-3001, and for other general corporate purposes. Additional indications or TIL products may be explored with the use of proceeds. Jefferies and Goldman Sachs are acting as joint lead book-running managers for the offering. Wells Fargo Securities is also serving as book-running manager."
In response to drops like a rock in an upmarket You just need to know that the general market has nothing to do with iova What matters1 resolving the assay issue2 results of phase 2 and 3 trials If 1 &2 are positive the stock will fly so high your head won’t be able to take the altitude- So please stop talking about the market Early biotechs are dependent on the results of studies and general sentiment and how important the disease is they are trying to treat not how the market is doing .
Awesome results just released https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-announces-clinical-data-updates-1
"No reason to panic, logical for some to sell with the huge run up we had last two weeks. Plenty of profit taking, can’t blame short term investors. Keep your eyes on the prize and this is a great chance to pick up more shares."
Best conference call I've heard in a while from IOVA yesterday. Interim CEO is very sharp and had all his generals brass polished and ready. I believe there is extremely good news coming on assays before the end of the year and 2022 will be big. We are back in my opinion.
look at the calls for June and July. someone thinks this will be over 30 to 40 by then. at least that is their bet. someone else mentioned this. I'm just adding to the post.
"Iovance will be first to market with a new first in class treatment. Hang on,be patient, and buy more."
"My god, ‘earnings’ on early-stage biotech’s are totally irrelevant. They don’t even have any sales or products being sold yet. You buy IOVA for its promising pipeline. Frankly, their conference call sounded quite upbeat and the CEO very sharp. She had previously stated that her goal (besides building the company) was to help cancer patients in the best way possible, be it on their own or with a larger firm. More analysts are talking buyout on this although I feel it may be a bit premature, but a 30% drop based on current financial results is highly unlikely. People in this stock are buying the ‘future,’ not the ‘present!’"
I think the interim CEO has the right credentials: science phd and law...exactly what this company needs right now to work thru the issues with FDA. Obviously situation w/previous CEO had become untenable and she had to either leave or the board was probably going to take action to replace her...who knows.
Whoever buys Iovance will need a huge chunk of change which makes me think it’ll be a company that dwarfs Giliad like a major pharma not a biotech like GiliadIovance market cap is already 4 billion plus so if they have the answer to solid tumors my guess is that it’s going to take at least 16 billion in a buy out and that is over100 a share - that’s got to be a huge company with lots of cash and stock but hopefully all cash like BMY or PFE or Lily or company’s like that
"Keytruda had sales of $14.3B in 2020 for an medium increase in life expectancy of about 9 months. IOVA had not yet reached median survival. Margins are much less on biologics due to manufacturing, but this will be huge."
"Replimune today disclosed (8k SEC filing prior to public offering) some more data on their RP1 trial in melanoma patients, with now reporting the first complete response in cutaneous melanoma post a-PD1 therapy. I'd say that is some stiff competition for IOVA!Read for yourselves (from the 8k, to be found on the SEC homepage): ""As of October 15, 2020, we have enrolled 36 melanoma and 20 non-melanoma skin cancer patients in this clinical trial, 18 of whom are evaluable for efficacy. In order to be evaluable for efficacy in this clinical trial, a patient must have had at least one follow up scan or disease progression before the first follow up scan. Patients received up to eight doses of RP1 (up to 10 mL per visit once every two weeks, with a first dose of 106 PFU/mL followed by 107 PFU/mL) and nivolumab (240mg once every two weeks for four months followed by 480mg once every four weeks for up to two years) from the second RP1 dose. Of the 36 melanoma patients, 16 cutaneous melanoma patients had previously received anti-PD-1 (eight of whom had also previously received anti-CTLA-4), eight cutaneous melanoma patients were naïve to anti-PD-1 therapy, six patients had mucosal melanoma, and six patients had uveal melanoma. At the data cut-off date, five patients with cutaneous melanoma who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy had responses (four partial responses and one complete response), four of whom also received prior anti-CTLA-4 therapy. An additional patient is classified as a surgical complete response and one patient remains on study with stable disease, having neither progressed nor met the formal definition for response. Further, four patients (two complete responses and two partial responses) with anti-PD-1 naïve cutaneous melanoma and two patients with mucosal melanoma (one of whom had prior anti-PD-1 therapy and achieved a complete response) had achieved responses."""
"The science/scientists and the technology this Co. have and all the take over of biotech companies I have seen lately, this Co. Is worth at least 8 - 10 billion dollars in my opinion."
"I've been long for a long time. I would like the buyout, however, if they remain independent and crank the share price up on their own, I can live with that, too."
This situation is getting very interesting.I wonder what the FDA would do if the sponsor were a big pharma like Novartis or Pfizer.Secondly I think this is gonna cause a big concern from the whole TIL field and they will voice it through open channel. It is important that Iovance organize TIL workshop to invite the KOLs in the field and also FDA officers to discuss issues from the progress in the field to potential path for BLA approval.
"If the treatment has efficacy, all the other problems will eventually be solved and the stock will recover. From trial data, though the number of patients are small, these are good numbers, especially consider these patients failed other treatments and ran out of options:Response, n (%) (1)Cohort 3Bn=28Objective Response Rate 6 (21.4)Complete Response (2) 1 (3.6)Partial Response 5 (17.9)Stable Disease 12 (42.9)Progressive Disease 6 (21.4)Non-Evaluable 4 (14.3)Disease Control Rate 18 (64.3)Median Duration of Response Not ReachedMin, Max (months) 1.2+, 20.7+"
Strong buy- expect $60 by year end
I give the management team a B+ for the conference call. Clarified lots of issue. One important thing she did was to clarify the expectation from the fda.
Trading like last February when the rumor mill was at work.
"Bad for healthcare costs, but the failure of the recent prescription/pharma drug price controls to get through the House of Reps may bode well for IOVA, LYEL, BLUE, TCRX, TCRR and other adoptive immune cell therapy companies whose drug products are likely to be quite expensive."

"Biotech market remains so difficult. Along with IOVA I own shares in ICPT and NVCR. Two winners and one loser in terms of gains v losses. Share prices go up when I believe a retracement is in order. Shares go down when it seems they should move up. Like today with Iovance. Sure, we all know ""buy the rumor, sell the news."" Today's news, I believe, should not have been priced into the share price. Oh well. Added shares under $24."
Note by Jefferies today is reiterating an M&A possibility for IOVA.
"Jefferies - Outperform, Target Price: 33Key Learnings from IOVA's FDA Experience in Melanoma Could Lead to A BetterRegulatory Outcome In Cervical Cancer: CEO Maria Fardis proposed the best scenario of FDA discussion would be full conversion of existing pts to a pivotal cohort where the co would enroll btwn 75-100 patients. By our estimate, IOVA could finish enrolling by YE '19 and file in '20. If FDA requires a new pivotal cohort, it could finish enrollment by 1H’20 and file by YE' 20/early '21. We think this cervical regulatory update in mid '19 is the next catalyst for shares."
Great EARNINGS conference call ...CONSIDER THIS... U.S. Government will mandate ALL MANUFACTURING of Critical Pharmaceuticals to be done in the U.S. (at least a minimum portion)ALL OF IOVA's therapeutics will be manufactured in their NEW U.S. plant in Philadelphia......a great head start!$65 target price by BAIRD is right on folks.
"I don't know if people on this board know why IOVA is going down, but it has something to do with NK's announcement at the JP Morgan conference. NantKwest or NK announced preliminary trial results that showed their Natural Killer combination with a Pdi and t cell response is getting complete remissions. They even pulled off the impossible and got a complete remission in a stage 4 metastasized pancreatic cancer which I think everyone knows is pretty much incurable. There is a 3% survival rate on that and they got a complete remission. They also got complete remissions on mutated refractory breast cancer and intramuscular bladder cancers. Do your due diligence. Most people do not know about those results but big players know."
tommorow and Friday this will be the stock to watch
Offering with excellent data and progress is always a positive thing in the long run.. Let's see how the offering price is set today..
"HCW - Buy - $32LN-145 accelerates towards registration with important FDA visibility. This morning, Iovance disclosedimportant updates regarding the regulatory path for LN-145 in cervical cancer. Following the end of Phase 2 meetingheld with the FDA, the agency has acknowledged that the innovaTIL-04 study should be sufficient to support theregistration of LN-145 for the treatment of patients with cervical cancer. Based on FDA feedback, Iovance announceda modified version of the trial’s protocol in order to better define the target population to be included in the BLAsubmission. Accordingly, the application is expected to include data obtained from: (1) a total of 75 to 100 patients;and (2) patients progressing after initial systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, which constitutesalmost all of the more advanced patients enrolled to date. As previously disclosed, the primary endpoint of the studyis objective response rate (ORR) for the population, which is to be assessed by a Blinded Independent ReviewCommittee (BIRC). Recall that LN-145 recently received Breakthrough Therapy designation. With the possibilityfor innovaTIL-04 to be registrational, the company is reasonably planning a path for BLA submission in 2H20.Based on the unmet medical need of the indication and the clinical data obtained so far, we believe that LN-145deserves the attention it is receiving. While the primary focus remains on Iovance's initial path to market with lifileucel(LN-144) in melanoma, we believe that, with the announcement this morning, LN-145 is a potential rapid followerto commercialization.Although preliminary, the numbers in cervical cancer are impressive. The recent updates provided on theinnovaTIL-04 study showed a compelling preliminary efficacy of the therapy with an ORR of 44% (1 CR, 9 PR, 2uPR), disease control rate or DCR of 89% at 3.5-month median study follow up and durable responses in 11 out of12 patients. Note that, these data were a positive and incremental update of the results reported in October 2018,showing an ORR of 27% with 4 confirmed PRs and DOR of 2.4-2.5+ months. In addition, durable responses wereobserved in some patients (n=4) after longer follow up. As we anticipated, we believe TIL therapy is increasinglybecoming a meaningful opportunity among the adoptive cell therapy options in solid tumors, as opposed to the lesssafe and efficacious CAR-T. Recall that, long term survival (>22 months), in cervical cancer patients treated withTILs has been reported by the NCI as well (Rosenberg lab) which we believe constituted an early validation forLN-145 and Iovance's efforts.Our thesis on TILs stands strong. In accordance with our thesis, showing efficacy in solid tumors beyondmelanoma continues to represent a game changer for Iovance and, on a broader look, we continue to view thiscompany as a viable takeout candidate for Big Pharma. We would like to reiterate that, apart from academic-basedTILs therapies such as NCI and MD Anderson, Iovance is the only biotech that is developing a commercial TILproduct to treat a variety of tumors and patients using the predefined cryopreserved 22-day manufacturing strategy.As such, and along with the recent efforts to establish its own GMP facility in Philadelphia and its reinforced existingmanufacturing collaboration with WuXi (WXXWY; not rated), we believe Iovance’s potential for meaningful marketshare within ACT-based therapies in cancer is now starting to take shape in the solid tumor setting.For"
"Maria was likely the one who turned down potential BO early last year? With her departure and the current low MC of 2.5B, do you guys think there is a possibility of BO?"
We should be able to make up for the losses and more within the next 15 months. Their first approval really shoul happen by the end of 2022.
"Maria Fardis and her team are positioned for a buyout should a bonafide offer of proper valuation present itself. She owns 2,500,000 warrants at a strike price that will pay her a large sum at 80 bucks take out. I think the institutions who own the stock would vote their approval of such a price."
"Cowen's Boris Peaker is on board with the possibility citing the company's skin (LN-144 in melanoma) and cervical cancer (LN-145) programs that could be worth as much as $6B while its other programs could be worth another $1B - 2B, adding that there are few viable competitors in the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) space. The company's current market cap is $4.1B."
"Separately, LN-145 is being evaluated in a phase 2 pivotal trial, C-145-04, for treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical cancer who have failed one prior therapy. Worldwide, cervical cancer affects 511,000 patients and 247,000 deaths occur yearly. At the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Iovance reported encouraging results for the C-145-04. Out of a population of 27 heavily pre-treated patients (mean of 2.4 prior lines of therapy), 44% ORR and 11% CR rate were achieved with median DOR not yet reached. To put things into context, Keytruda was approved based on accelerated review for cervical cancer with 14.7% ORR and 2.6% CR rate, in a study with 98 patients. The FDA has since acknowledged that Iovance's Phase 2 study may be used for registration and Iovance plans to increase the cohort size of the trial to 75 and enrollment is expected to be completed by the middle of 2020 with a BLA submission to the FDA expected by the end of 2020.In addition, Iovance is also evaluating TIL in several more indications and earlier lines of treatment. C-145-03 is a phase 2 trial evaluating safety and efficacy of LN-145 for the treatment of patients with recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. IOV-COM-202 is a phase 2, multicenter trial made up of 4 cohorts. Cohort 1 is evaluating Lifileucel in combination with Keytruda for Melanoma while cohort 2 is evaluating LN-145 in combination with Keytruda for Head & Neck cancer. Cohort 3 and 4 are evaluating LN-145 in combination with Keytruda and LN-145 respectively for non-small cell lung cancer (""NSCLC"").Beyond solid tumors, Iovance is also developing Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (""PBL"") therapy for hematological malignancies. Iovance recently announced that an Investigational New Drug (""IND"") application was accepted by the FDA to conduct trial with IOV-CLL-01 for patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (""CLL"")."
Bought into $iova under $30 this morning. Strong pipeline. LONG
Good article today in Seeking Alpha on IOVA and being a leader in the treatment of solid cancer tumors. The best as I read it. :-)
Maria was very excited about sharing melanoma results at ASCO. All of their programs are ahead of schedule. NSCLC is a huge market. They are waiting to recruit a few more patients and for the data to mature before they present their NSCLC cohort data. If that data is impressive similar to Melanoma and Cervical they will get lot of interest from the big name Pharmas. They want to go frontline in combination with Keytruda in lung. This is a huge market . They will need partners or be acquired to go first line combo route.
"of important note, ALLO reported. ""Allogeneic cell therapies to treat cancer"" results of a recent trial. The data was below expectations. Underscores my opinion autologous cells are a more efficacious and safer therapy to treat solid tumors.IOVA will be first to commercialize efficacious therapies to treat solid tumor cancers. I believe we should see more institutions buying into this notion."
"good day today. a penny away from 52 week low. (maybe not, a new 52 low as I type). Guess they didn't like the data in the journal. Should have published in Playboy magazine."
"I am hoping the price action of the last two days is in anticipation of the data to be released in November. Based on the company's capital expenditure, hiring and data to this point, I believe they are anticipating FDA approvals for a couple of the indications including melanoma and Cervical cancer. If the data continues to pint in this direction, the price of our shares should rise accordingly and in anticipation of commercialization within 18 months. Also, the company should be in play as a takeover target."

"From the Instil Bio S-1: ''Twenty-one patients with stage IV metastatic cutaneous melanoma were treated in this compassionate use program between 2011 and 2019. Treatment led to an ORR of 67%, including four patients (19%) who achieved CR and ten patients (48%) who achieved a PR. The DCR, which included patients with CR, PR or SD, was 86%. Based on these clinical results and our discussions with the FDA, we plan to submit an IND for ITIL-168 and, if authorized to proceed, initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2021. We believe this trial, if successful, could support a BLA submission in 2023. Additionally, in the first half of 2022, we intend to initiate Phase 1 trials of ITIL-168 in tumor types where evidence of immune cell recognition and elimination of cancer cells has been observed, such as CSCC, NSCLC, HNSCC and cervical cancer.''"

"Just added.3 years from now, if IOVA's approach works, its worth $12-15 billion. Nothing that happened yesterday or today make the TIL approach any more or less likely to succeed. We did see a delay and we did see the CEO go. Have seen this before. Held IMMU, which had a major CRL delay in early 2019 and fired a CEO. Share price was about $10. You know what didn't change? The science. Stuff got fixed, results started coming out 15 months or so later and IMMU was bought by GILD for $88/share in late 2020. I can't say if history will repeat, but the upside if the IOVA approach works has gotten enormously larger with the shares down so much."
Not sure if technicals are a tool i would use to analyze the price action but the 50 day moving average is $19.73. If we can clear it with good volume we may experience another leg up. Next month important data will be presented
"I rely more on fundamental analysis than trend analysis to make my investment decisions but one trend over time historically that holds true for most companies who, eventually have continuous revenue and later earnings growth, is the price highs get higher and the price lows get higher. When looking at the 2 year chart for IOVA, and, specifically for the last 18 months, this trend appears to be happening about every quarter. So more long term positions being held and buyers coming in on the dips. Even though no revenue growth yet the significant potential for IOVA, and the belief in its pipeline of life changing medicines, is causing this and as an investor one has to love it. Many successes ahead of us as investors I believe."
The share price drop was due to the announced dilution...'You don't raise money when your prospects and results arepoor. You raise cash when your prospects are good.We'll see later Thursday where we end up. My guess a pointor two in either direction.
I think we're just treading water for the rest of the year.
The stock offering is very positive in the long run. It gives them optionality. It gives them time and gives them the ability to negotiate any offers from a position of strength. The results are outstanding . Cohort 4 data mirrors the cohort 2 results . I believe potential buy and/or partnership offers will come after the melanoma and cervical registration trial results are released . We have many value driver catalysts coming up including the results of the lung cancer trial cohorts in the basket study.
"Wells Fargo, Update, OverweightWe are reiterating our OUTPERFORM rating on Iovance (IOVA, $19.10) following update on a TILlike cell therapy for CLL. We are attending the European Association of Hematology (EHA) annual meeting where earlier today (6/14), Iovance (IOVA) and collaborators at OSU presented preclinical data supporting a firstinman clinical trial of IOV2001, a polyclonal peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) product in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) that is expected to begin later this year. IOVA developed a 9day GMP manufacturing process to derive clinically relevant numbers of PBL from 50mL of cryopreserved peripheral blood derived from IMBRUVICA treated CLL/SLL (iCLL) patients. IOVA evaluated 3 sources of peripheral blood: healthy volunteers, preiCLL and postiCLL noting reliable high level expansion only from postiCLL; paired pre and post IMBRUVICA samples were available. Following expansion, 9798% of cells in the final product were alpha/beta T cells of which 7080% in the postiCLL product were effector memory populations; decreasing production from 14 to 9 days doubled the proportion of central memory Tcells from approximately 10% to 20%. In a nonTCR specific assessment of IFN gamma production, PBL from postiCLL was approx. 2fold and 10fold higher than PBL sources from naive or preiCLL subjects. Against autologous CLL for pairs pre and post IMBRUVICA, a higher degree of HLAdependent killing at a chosen effector to target ratio was observed for postiCLL than preiCLL PBL products."

"Jefferies analyst Biren Amin calls the data reported by Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA) the ""big winner"" for the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. The ASCO update suggests Iovance's tumor infiltrating lymphocytes therapy could open the door for cell therapy in the ""lucrative"" solid-tumor market, Amin tells investors in a research note. He points out the company reported that no new patients have progressed in the melanoma trial and offered first evidence of clinically meaningful durability for TIL therapy. Also, its cervical data that reported a 44% overall response rate is three-times greater than reported with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in a similar patient population, contends Amin. He believes last night's update could drive a 30%-40% rally in shares of Iovance. The analyst keeps a Buy rating on the name with a $29 price target. Iovance in premarket trading is up 26%, or $2.97, to $14.20."
"Company has no current sales so ‘earnings’ are irrelevant. One buys IOVA for a wager on its future potential that looks promising. An eventual acquisition is probable, but some product progress reports, particularly on cervical cancer where early reports outflanked MRK’s blockbuster Keytruda coming out in about a week are more likely to move the shares than ‘earnings.’"
"Iovance Biotherapeutics price target raised to $31 from $11 at Jefferies Jefferies analyst Biren Amin raised his price target for Iovance Biotherapeutics to $31 saying the FDA is likely to agree to the company's proposal to run a Phase II trial in refractory melanoma using less stringent endpoints such as response rates and duration of response versus overall survival.

"The options recently granted are over $25 strike. This is encouraging since Senior managment is in this deal to make money on their holdings. That said, the options have a duration of 10 years. I doubt any buyout is around the corner. Contrary to the rumors that were posted recently"
"Did suggest there might be a PR ahead of JPM. The prospect of a product from a NVS license is a long way off, however it obviously signals that they are talking with Novartis. What they will do next will be to try and secure a supply of Proleukin product that they can signal to the market that there is no risk to their development plans. The outstanding issue for then remains their reliance on Proleukin in the commercial world. The price of that is around $4500 a vial and with each patient getting circa 15 vials across 6 courses, that is $72k per patient....when added to the cost of the TIL that is quite an add on. Importantly, at the moment it’s also a variable cost that they cannot control and could increase."
Would not be surprised to see Gilead make an offer for IOVA. The science behind IOVA came from the same NIH researchers as KITE's CAR-T therapy (who Gilead already bought)
"Prospective buyer will get best TIL technology out there with patents. The melanoma and cervix indications is only part of story. TILs being studied in phase II for head and neck, lung, triple negative breast, ovarian, pancreas, sarcoma, and CLL/SLL. Total value here is big as potential in other indications is what buyer will receive. Kite went for $12B and Juno for $9B in hematological leukemia indications. Iova has potential in several solid tumors...board will not sell for cheap...I say $10B or go it alone and continue growing the company."
"Guys, this will trade like BIIB -- yes, at $350+ -- when all the chips fall in place!!"

"Be careful with your stops. When we were sitting on pins and needles waiting for the verdict on GLPG’s RA drug, the stock was sitting on about 89 and I put a stop in at 83. The morning of the (favourable) result announcement, it hit actually my stop price -pre-market - that I never play, and now sits 100 points higher! Bio’s have big risks and big rewards and instead of trying to trade them, do your DD and then just hope you’re right. A friend in the business said IOVA’s results so far, particularly, with cervical cancer where it substantially outperformed MRK’s blockbuster, Keytruda, could be the start of something big. These are not stocks for traders."

"But when they are close to approval, the share price will be north of $50 anyway. The take over price might be close to $12 billion. But again that is how the big pharma deals work."
Ark still has a ton Only worry when they sell it all
"The selling of IOVA stock began approximately at the conclusion of the AACR presentation. While the results of the single cohort trial may have been underwhelming, the presenter was excited by the results. There were two CRs and both are still in remission almost a year later. One of the two had a particularly hard to treat disease. Along with TIL treatment, Opdivo was included. It has been pointed out that Opdivo on its own is improbable to be responsible for the remissions."
"This is a great company despite some inconsistent communication from management, which isn’t their fault. They provided a robust rebuttal to FDA and I anticipate the assay being approved. I work in cancer treatment and these are patient populations with a huge unmet need. Melanoma patients are essentially sent home to die after they fail IO and BRAF/MEKi. CAR-T has changed hematologic malignancies and TIL cellular therapy has the chance to do the same for solid tumours."
"Folks, this company has the best treatment available for solid tumors. They ain't gonna be entertaining a buyout until the stock hits $1,000 a share."
Bloomberg reported they were in talks. They still are in talks. Bloomberg did their job.
"If this turns out to be the solid tumor answer to Kite , Juno, and Bluebird for liquid tumors it will THE blockbuster because solid tumors make up 80 percent of all cancers And you know what happened to the 3 companies mentioned above ? They are they the roof or bought out for billions"

Alex I am the furthest person from a pumper - I just know what this company could do to change the paradigm to treating solid tumors Only saying what it could be If it happens Cancer in case you haven’t read the papers is a big thing and people are clamoring for an answer or any answer
Really impressed at the issue’s ability to hold under tremendous downside pressure from the market now.
"As early as ARK got in, I'm sure the sales are still at a profit. Maybe just pulling some off thetable and locking in profits, and holding the rest for the big score. Did the FDA give a timetable when they refused it and wanted better data?"
This is what happens when you don't deliver on the schedule you promised. Now we are really subject to the systemic risk of a market meltdown with nothing of substance other than wonderful data. Data does not make a company.
"I'm confused here. The pr's wording is weird. They say that they're GOING to have a 500 million dollar offering and they didn't give a price yet. That makes it seem as if the dilution hasn't hit yet and people are selling off in anticipation of a drop off. Not bashing here, just confused why they wouldn't say an agreed upon price yet."
$IOVA is a fantastic company with amazing technology. The cash raise was the only thing they really needed. Now they are good for over 2 more years if no buyer comes.
"It’s time for Farris to go, clearly not CEO material. The inability to get FDA approval, now looking at 2022, inexcusable. That’s when they are supposed to be opening Philadelphia operations. What if they don’t get approval then? Don’t open? She had to go."
"Well, at least iova is not on a recent list of stocks Cathie is selling."
"Hopefully history repeats. Last January the stock was down 21.5% for the month, February we were up 51.4 %, and up 18.9% ytd. This January we are down 5.5% mtd , but 19% off of the high of $54.21. So, we’ve been to this rodeo before. Last spring was bad with the pandemic hitting the market hard in March. I remember grabbing a 1,000 shs at the low around $20. Not suggesting any genius on my part just an obvious oversell and opportunity. I post this to encourage everyone to be optimistic and I think we will get some good news this first quarter and price action to follow. I’d be happy getting back to $50 by the end of February, small victories."
The question is ? Is ARK someone to follow it listen to ?I watch a lot of business shows and this is the first place I have ever heard of them?
ORR (tumour shrinking rate) actually improved from 38% to 41% six months’ ago for melanoma. Makes no sense. And their cervical cancer rate (6 months’) ago was 44% vs Keytruda’s 14%. What am I missing here?
"iova rating is maintained by the analyst, expecting upside later in the day as the market will recover slowly, following is the linkhttps://seekingalpha.com/instablog/498952-bret-jensen/5447402-biotech-analyst-run-down-for-thursday"
"one year ago, rumors were circulated which prompted a news item that the company was in play as an acquisition target. No doubt, there were serious talks. The rumors persisted, nothing happened and as a result they announced a 600 million offering in June we saw the stock lose 15 percent of its value. Today, primarily as a result of ARK and the entire genomic momentum, we are up substantially. Frankly, the company has not done much other than report expected results from the ongoing studies and begin enrolling patients in the nsclc trial. Today they file another shelf offering to raise another 350 million.....that is if they can execute at $49.65 per share. Nothing from the company other than the 8k. Why haven't they presented a news release? Is this money a safety net against another delay? I think they owe us an explanation other than the boiler plate 8k."
"Well, load up people. I'm selling half my shares for some rebalancing, every time I do this, this price goes up, and no, it doesn't help if I wait. Gotta do it now. You're welcome!"
"From one PDF: ''Success rate of growth of viable TIL from bladder tumours were 100%. Yield of TIL from the 5 tumours was an average of 24 billion viable cells. Bladder TIL were generally comparable in function and phenotype to TIL generated from other indications. The excellent success in growth of TIL from bladder cancer allows for the application of Iovance’s Gen 2 manufacturing process for an autologous cellular infusion product to treat bladder cancer patients.Based on this data, a Phase 2 trial has been initiated investigating LN-145 TIL in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have failed cisplatin-based chemotherapy (NCT03935347).''"
Production will be starting in their new manufacturing facility within 16-20 months. Many institutional buyers would start adding to their positions this early as they think longer term time frames than most retail investors these days.

"This reminds me the drop of JUNO stock from 50s to 18s due to a series of fallbacks related to brain edema of their lead asset. That was a disaster. Kudo for JUNO for get JCAR017 going and got it approved, along with a hefty buy out price.Novartis and Bluebird BLAs were delayed for 1 year and 18 months respectively. JUNO for 3-4 years. What Iovance should do is be transparent with investors and provide good PR to put all things into perspective.JUNO went from $18 to $90 within a year. If Iovance wants to retain Maria, the company needs to bring in a top notch regulatory team and investor relationship person."
"Personnally, I think the FDA is holding a lot of the new bio-tech up. Why? The results are certainly well ahead of any other treatments on the market, in fact, these are life saving treatments. So if you save 85% of the 100% who would have otherwise died you get the product to the market right? Nothing is ever perfect. The FDA does not appear to think like that. I am seeing it with other bio techs as well. Not just IOVA. The FDA may be holding back as big Pharma wants a chance to ""catch up"" or to let these companies keeping draining their cash dry knowing they will have to sell to big pharma some day. The FDA is part science and part political and all, ""we are short staffed and only work 40 hours a week"" people after all. We, as a country, need to do better with how fast these innovative and life changing drugs, which seem to be incredibly safe to use, can come to market."
This board has seen better days.
"Looks like Cathy Wood didn't sell any shares yesterday. Short volume was only 40% albeit on much higher volume. Company needs to provide more transparency on the issues with the FDA. If they don't, that is confirmation they either don't know what the FDA wants or don't have a strategy to resolve them technically."
"Dilution. SEC filing just out. They are upping number of shares issued for equity compensation, so this will cancel out gains from the conference presentation."
the technicals are very weak for Iova and the market in general. We should not be in this position. Lack of execution is appalling..
About time this thing broke out.
I heard about IOVA the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

Cathy Wood took advantage on this short meltdown to load up almost 1.6M shares... brilliant
"Had about $400 million last report + a $400 shelf registration so cash should be fine. If trials continue to look positive, will likely be acquired at some point. Their building of a $75 million new plant over 3 years must hint that things are progressing well."
Maria Fardis has a stellar CV. She helped shepherd another company through the acquisition process. I think a buyout or partnership is still possible once they have the BLAs
Management does a poor job communicating with its shareholders. Only savvy investors are well versed enough to find filings presented as 8K documents. A 5 percent dilution and raise of 350 million is a material event.
"Stiefel initiating coverage - summary - We are initiating on Iovance Biotherapeutics with a Buy rating and a target price of $27 per share. Our positive thesis is predicated on (1) the prior data generated in advanced melanoma and cervical cancers where the unmet need is high, (2) our view that the upcoming pivotal readouts will be positive, (3) what we think is a favorable competitive landscape and (4) our belief that the market opportunity for an autologous TIL product in the advanced melanoma/cervical cancer setting can reach $2+ billion at peak. We think that the trial design of the pivotal cohorts is favorable and should benefit from a high probability of replicating the prior data as many trial sites and lead investigators remain the same. This is notable as we’d expect investigators to benefit from past experience with Iovance’s sample requirements and for the manufacturing success rate to therefore remain high."
"H.C Wainwright CO - BUYStrong concordance between investigator assessments andindependent review committee (IRC). At SITC 2019 as a Late Breaker, Iovance presented the highly anticipated response rate data as assessed by the IRC from cohort 2 of the lifileucel (LN-144) Phase 2 advanced melanoma study. Ahead of these data, the bear case was apparently that the IRC would determine a lower ORR relative to cowboy investigators who like to see responses on scans where they do not necessarily exist. The result was the complete opposite as thefigure below indicates; 34.8% ORR by IRC and 36.4% by investigators (concordance rate of 89.4%).Further, as part of this latest data cut, the duration of responses continues to improve; as of the last data cut in August 2019, DOR was 11.3 months, and as of SITC (October 24, 2019 cut), median follow-up DOR was 12.8 months and the median has still not been reached. Details and updates from the melanoma pivotal program, cohort 4: key dates are 1Q20 and late 2020. The Important dates to bear in mind is 1Q20 for enrollment completion of LN-144 registrational pivotal cohort 4 in metastatic melanoma, with BLA submission in late 2020. Currently, dosing of cohort 4 is ongoing (NCT02360579), in metastatic melanoma who failed previous SoC. As a reminder, cohort 4 looks to enroll 75 metastatic melanoma patients post PD-1 inhibition and BRAF/MEK inhibitions if BRAF mutation positive. Of note, cohort 4 is going to be based on the primary endpoint of ORR, assessed by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC)."
"$30 today? - IOVANCE - FDA AGREED ONGOING SINGLE-ARM PHASE 2 INNOVATIL-04 STUDY MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT REGISTRATION OF LN-145 IN ADVANCED CERVICAL CANCER“The FDA’s agreement to consider acceptability of the ongoing study in patients with cervical cancer significantly accelerates our path to BLA submission for LN-145,” said Maria Fardis, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Iovance Biotherapeutics. “This feedback is encouraging. The ability to use the current study, as well as the Breakthrough Therapy designation recently granted to LN-145, allows us to plan on a path to BLA submission in the second half of 2020.”"
"I'll be watching this tomorrow. if it gets to $20 I will add to my position. this isn't a death blow to the company, imo."
When they say the ORR (overall response rate) has not been reached my understanding is that the effectiveness of the drug is still progressing. And therefore the news is not negative. Right? or Wrong?
"PiperJaffray - Target: 30, OverweightFollowing up on IOVA's update for cohort 2 of melanoma's lifileucel study at SITC, we attempted to perform some Kaplan-Meier analyses to help gauge where the median duration of response may ultimately land. We considered various scenarios including a ""worst-case"" scenario where we converted every ongoing responder to a progressor as of their last follow-up. Even in a ""worst-case"" scenario our analysis suggests a mDOR of 10.6 months and points to an eventual very favorable mDOR for cohort 2. Again, we believe this ultimately has implications around commercial adoption and peak penetration if replicated in cohort 4, which is projected to complete enrollment in 1Q20 and support a regulatory filing in late-'20. Reiterate Overweight.• A Kaplan-Meier DOR analysis based on SITC IRC data. On Friday we noted that 61% of patients were still in response at 11.3 months of median follow-up per IRC and we crudely extrapolated from the swimmer's plot that mDOR would easily exceed 6.5months. However, a Kaplan-Meier analysis, which some investors have been asking for, would be more appropriate to try and speculate on where mDOR may eventually land. As such, we attempted a Kaplan-Meier analysis using data from the swimmer's plot of the 23 patients who had a response to lifileucel. In total, there were 14 patients with ongoing responses and 5 patients without documented progression but lost to follow-up. Per K-M analysis these patients would all be censored at the time of their last follow-up. For example, patient 45 experienced a response at 1.9 months per our estimate (mean time to response was 1.9 months at ASCO) and had their last-follow up at 8 months without documented progression, but was lost to follow-up. This patient had a response that lasted 6.1 months and would not be considered a progression event and would be censored as of the last follow-up. In total there were 4 progression events at the time of data cutoff. A full data table and K-M curve is provided in page 2, but a mDOR clearly has not been reached."
Just read that with the money from selling regeneration Sanofi is looking for companies specializing in Oncology and rare diseases . So IOVA is in okay but they also want to use only 3 to 5 billion which leaves IOVA out of a cash deal . They said they could leverage up to 50 billion which I think means a cash and stock deal perhaps for 10 billion or more .If that happens with IOVA I think I would take the cash and immediately sell the shares of Sanofi I get . The reason is that Sanofi is big pharma with a lot of revenue and to ge honest any profits from IOVA pipeline will get lost in the Sanofi stock price . You’ll never realize the immense potential of IOVA if it’s just part of a large pharma . But then again if it’s a cure for solid tumors even the largest if pharma will make a lot of money and add to their revenues and profits in a big way I guess it’s a problem I would like to have Lol
We hit the new high followed by the short term money taking profits. To be expected. I think next week will bring a new surge to the stock price with new investors.
"Dr. Rosenberg has now shown that responders (melanoma) to ACT receive infusion products containing a pool of stem-like neoantigen-specific TIL that are able to undergo prolific expansion, give rise to differentiated subsets, and mediate long-term tumour control (mostly CRs) and T-cell persistence. The data also suggest that this subset (stem-like (CD39-CD69-) is likely distinct from subsets usually enriched for (CD39+ and/or CD39+CD69+). The latter is associated with poor TIL persistence and efficacy post-treatment."
"Folks, please watch this, there is no reason to sell now. Stay strong and long!https://www.iovance.com/about/iovance-manufacturing/"
Data on Lifileucel for an unmet need is too good to hit the lows the bears are hoping for on this board! We are 3 months in a typical 5 month biotech swoon and an average 30% selloff that will stir M&A. This is also a pipeline within drug for many potential tumor types. IOVA has to be on top of the list for potential acquirers. If approved it would be worth north of $20B using IMMU as a benchmark. So at this stage I can't image it be sold for less than a 50% discount. 50% would be $48 and I highly doubt that given the cash and the manufacturing facility they just completed in Philly. I think fair discounted value at this stage would be 65% or $62-63/share.
"CEO sounds encouraged:The data, which you might see tomorrow will be updated for the Friday poster. We are cutting the data with update. There also will be additional information regarding investigator and DOR sort of assessment because we have committed to the street that any time we have an update to provide it. We are obviously very pleased with the data. This is part of why we are putting it out."
The price action during market selloff tells you everything. Read the print. Soon the bird will sing!
Patient investors are going to have handsome returns I believe. Buy the dips.
"Excellent presentation by Maria and the questions from the JMP analyst were good. Expect to file BLA for melanoma by year end and possibly cervical before the year as well. Excited about the TIL potential in HN and Lung. Cell therapy for solid cancers is evolving rapidly . Iova is working on gen-3 , and PD1 specific TILs for HN. Looks like they may have a win in HN and lung which will be huge. Iova is way ahead of others in cell therapy for solid cancers. I believe the value of iova will grow as the market realizes the potential value . We are in early stages . Recommend hanging on to our shares and be patient."
ARK continues to accumulate Iovance. They also have a large position in CRSP.
GS maintains BUY with $93 target today
"6 analysts lowered the TP range $35-51, buy, outperform, overweight - Wood holds close to 13%, my experience says oversold"
An ORR of 86% for Lifileucel in combination with Keytruda in immune checkpoint inhibitor naïve advanced melanoma patients.
"Ok, trying to find the positive. We are @ 68% off the low from May. I think if we get to $30 in July we are in a good position. Not trying to be unreasonably optimistic. But, get the CEO situation resolved, BLA/assay situation resolved or at least favorably communicated, and no other shoes dropping, maybe we are back in the 40’s by year-end. I know, “ nice dreams” have a good weekend."
With these great results with a dingle dose ... why are they not doing trial cohorts with additional doses ? Seems like muti-dose could be a complete homerun
Why the steady decline?
"iova will be first to market with broadly effective cell therapies for solid tumors. The manufacturing process will become faster and less expensive. Notwithstanding a systemic meltdown, i I see $100 next year."
Yes Kathy has begun selling IOVANCE for the last 2 days
"Great news on vaccine. Seems to be rotation, taking gains to buy reopening stocks."
"ARKK sold 413,000 shs today, not a vote of confidence. Hope upcoming conference call brings some news, anything would be welcome."
"Here's what stuck out for me on the Yahoo news press release: ""For Cohort 2, median duration of response has not been reached at 18.7 months of study follow up. Available care for metastatic melanoma patients enrolled into our program is chemotherapy, which has been reported to offer a 4-10% response rate with a very short median duration of response."" You've got a ORR at 36.4% with continually lengthening duration vs. chemo at 4-10% ORR and short duration."
"Low volume, end-of-year profit taking; Nothing has changed in the past 4 days -- IOVA still has game-changing cancer treatment on the horizon to address 82% of cancers out there! Buy on dips."
"I think the presentations yo come this friday and next week, will serve to entice the investors who focus on later stage clinical development companies. We need several consecutive days of heavy trading with an upward bias to clear out a percentage of shorts and establish a new and elevated trading range."
Higher than average volume Price increasing significantly into the close Could we be waking up Monday or any other Monday morning to a buy out I’d love to see the activity at iovance this weekendHow many lawyers come thru the doors
"I am surprised we are not seeing more activity. This morning IOVA presented the outline for their Phase 2/3 study on non small cell lung cancer. Four Cohorts. Based on the preliminary results the company has for small cell lung cancer, we all should be very excited. I believe if the data looks strong, this would be an ideal application to be fast tracked by the FDA. Especially with one BLA under our belts and another (Cervical Cancer) on its way. Not to mention head and neck cancer.I strongly believe autologous cells are going to prove to be a major clinical breakthrough for the treatment of a byroad spectrum of solid tumors. The evidence already exists. Manufacture efficiencies along with cost decreases will ensue in the coming years. Buyers of this company will be lining up again next year."
"Hello everyone, just got in to this at 47. What are the upcoming catalysts for this year and 2022? any deadlines set regarding fda approvals or trial deadlines? thank you!"
"Glass is half full. We all hate to see secondaries because of the short term dilution. Myself included. But, the silver lining to this dark cloud is that management has enough confidence in what they are doing to ignore the current m&a offers or suggestions and keep on moving forward. They will raise enough cash to see them through 2021. They obviously see greater value creation coming down the road. It is also a signal to potential buyers to come with serious offers ($$$$$) if you really are interested. All and all this is a very good thing, painful in the short run but great in the long run. I was in Daniel’s camp thinking we would get bought out in the $80 range. I now think we will be well north of $100 , but it may be a bit longer to wait. Keep your chins up."
Astra Zeneca is in talks to merge with Gilead. The combined company with a market cap of over $240B can easily afford iovance . Hang tight guys until the melanoma and cervical registrational trial results are announced . The lung cancer data when it is released will move the shares much higher . We have already seen some of the data from Moffet study which should give us confidence in the NSCLC basket study results
"IOVA’s technology is licensed from Dr Stephen Rosenberg who discovered immunotherapy and is a biotech legend. Note some info on Rosenberg ( below):Szent-Györgyi Prize to honor NCI’s Steven A. RosenbergPosted: February 12, 2019Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., will be the recipient of the 2019 Szent-Györgyi Prize.Credit: National Institutes of HealthThe 2019 Szent-Györgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research will be awarded to Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health. The prize, awarded annually by the National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR), recognizes Dr. Rosenberg’s pioneering role in the development of adoptive immunotherapy to treat cancer.Dr. Rosenberg, chief of CCR’s Surgery Branch, developed the first effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for selected patients with advanced cancer and was the first to successfully insert foreign genes—in this case, genetically modified T cells—into humans. His immunotherapy clinical trials have resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma, sarcomas, lymphomas, and other cancers.“Dr. Rosenberg’s groundbreaking work has changed cancer research and what we know about treatment, but his findings have also immeasurably changed patients’ lives,” said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. “We are proud to see him awarded the Szent-Györgyi Prize, which recognizes work that has lasting impact while also honoring the importance of basic research in understanding cancer.”Dr. Rosenberg’s clinical trials of the protein interleukin 2 (IL-2) led to the first immunotherapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer in 1992. When investigating the mechanism of IL-2 that causes cancer regression in patients with metastatic melanoma, Dr. Rosenberg identified immune cells that had cancer-fighting properties called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). He and his team were the first to show in clinical trials that TILs extracted from a tumor, grown to large numbers in the lab, and then administered back to a patient, a treatment known as adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy, could lead to tumor regression in patients with advanced melanoma. With his team, Dr. Rosenberg also initially developed a form of ACT immunotherapy in which a patient’s T cells are removed, genetically engineered in the laboratory to bind to specific proteins on cancer cells and kill them, and then administered back to the patient. He was the first to use T lymphocytes genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to successfully treat patients with aggressive lymphomas. In 2017, the FDA approved the first CAR T-cell therapies for children and young adults with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and then for adults with advanced lymphomas. At the time, William Dahut, M.D., scientific director for clinical research in CCR, called the first approval of CAR T-cell therapy “a landmark moment for cancer immunotherapy.”In his current research, Dr. Rosenberg is working to extend ACT to patients with common epithelial cancers. In June 2018, Nature Medicine published findings on a new approach he developed using a modified form of ACT that led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient whose cancer was unresponsive to all other treatments. Though still experimental, the new approach is dependent on targeting mutations, giving it the potential to be used for the treatment of many kinds of cancer."
Iova put out a release yesterday. zit is very measured but upbeat. BLA filing for melanoma in early 2021. Cervical to follow later next year. Pipeline is extremely
The pre and post market alpha trades never seem to hold up or translate into real numbers but the 7.23 is also on yahoo so maybe it’s for real
"Donot understand, very good data = sell off"
"Read the reports about their cervical cancer tests. They were miles better than the current ‘gold standard,’ MRK’s keytruda on solid tumour. If their TIL system can expand to other solid rumours, could be huge. Likely eventual acquisition."
"One advantage of mRNA is the ease with which multiple genes can be co-introduced into, and expressedin, the same cell, in controllable levels and ratios.

Does anyone know why IOVA shares are dropping today ? Down 10-12 percent? Making for a bad Monday. Thank you!
"Haven’t posted in several weeks. Looking for a positive? Take a look at the six month chart. Okay, We are coming off a miserable low @ $16 , but a nice slow build to $27. 68% up. Still, well off the $54 high. If we can get some news about a new CEO, maybe even a hint about assays, BLA, etc. then I think ( hope ) that we may be close to the 35-40 range by year end, maybe."
"There are only three reasons to put the lawyer in charge. Bankruptcy, lawsuits, or to sell the company. Hopefully there is no current need for bankruptcy. Lawsuits out of the extremely poor handling of the past 24 hours is a certainty. There were rumors a year ago that a deal was on the table. There is no excuse for how Maria/ Board mishandled this situation. The FDA has pulled the rug out from a number of Bios since the election. They have become very conservative and unwilling to provide guidance on how to move forward. That may be what happened here, but if so why not provide transparency and if new leadership is needed, a smooth transition plan. That just didn't happen. The best path forward may will be the sale of the company. You may want to reconsider your vote for the annual meeting."
"8 trading days and counting below the secondary price. The sudden departure of the CFO should be addressed in a direct and effective way. I would like to know the truth. Why did a well versed long time CFO leave in such an untimely manner? The company owes us a truthful explanation. No doubt, his departure has impacted the stock negatively and will continue to do so as speculation and uncertainty will weigh on the price action."

"Lyell Immunopharma has completed its manufacturing facility and will move TCR-Ts, CAR-Ts and TIL into the clinic for a range of solid tumours. To improve efficacy, they redefine the ways T-cells are selected and expanded as well as modulate their functionality (via genetic and epigenetic reprogramming technologies). This should help to overcome exhaustion and loss of durable stemness, which includes proliferative capacity, ability to self-renew and ability to differentiate"
This leg up feels very different from the previous rallies over the last 7-8 months. It feels sustainable. It indeed looks like solid institutional buying.
"The company will host its second quarter financial results conference call and webcast on Thursday, August 6."
They just announced new numbers this morning for the combo treatment which had a 43% complete response. Even though it’s only seven patients that’s pretty significant. No?￼
"It is very encouraging to see buyers step in at these levels. Make no mistake, there are money managers that focus on late stage biotechs. Albeit the market is up, this price action is supports what most believe on this thread."
"A screaming buy .. Merck will buy this company, combo it with Keytruda and OWN the cancer treatment market ..Game Set & Match"
$80/share buyout offer forthcoming soon. IOVA will surge before April 28

"Either we are building a base or this is just a buildup to sell the news. Light volume but i am sure there are more buyers waiting for additional data increasing the probability of FDA approval for the first indication. Once that happens, the market will begin to discount other approvals down the road."
"Just to have some fun, since we are getting brutalized in the market again. What would you do?If we got a buyout offer at $60, that would be a 100% premium over current market, but only a @ 11% premium over the recent high. Would you take it? I've had a buyout target of $80-100 for the past two years, so it's below what I want, but tempted. My avg. cost is $20, so making money, but have to say, really disappointed lately. I'm hanging on and tempted to buy more."
Pray for a buyout
we are heading towards a beta of over 3 soon. The company will provide more information on its various trials next week. we have ea very exciting future and a volatile one.
"Cathie Wood may be selling but this is more important:8-29-21 Medscape: Two Metastatic Lung Cancer Patients Are Disease-Free for 1.5 Years after TILs. ""Out of 16 patients, among 13 evaluable patients, 3 had confirmed responses and 11 had reduction in tumor burden. Two patients achieved complete responses that were ongoing 1.5 years following TIL treatment."" These are lung cancer patients with no other good options."
"A number of salient points were presented on the quarterly conference call. It is important that COVID-19 has not effected IOVA's clinical trials or construction of their new commercial facilities.*IOVA on track to meet with FDA and submit BLA in late 2020 (melanoma) Cohort 4 surpassed enrollment due to increased demand for participation*IOVA on track to complete dosing approx. midyear 2020 (cervical)*IOVA on track to meet with FDA and file BLA later this year (cervical) The 2 BLAs are not dependent on each other & may be submitted separately*C-145-03 clinical study in head and neck cancer utilizes Gen 3 TIL therapy process, as well as, LN-145-S1 the PD-1 TIL product* IOVAs mfg. facility on track to be operational in 2021 & support commercial supply in 2022AACR's importance: 61,000 registrants; 21,210 live views of Immunotherapy Clinical TrialsCMO pointed out that Moffit TIL is not the same as IOVA's TIL. Moffitt used a process similar to IOVA's Gen. 1 mfg. process. CMO also said ""We are very pleased to see Moffitt's TIL show durable complete responses"" and added Moffitt's initial data is foundational for IOVA's own 2 cohorts of NSCLC.CMO also talked about ASCO saying they were pleased that ASCO had accepted, for oral presentation, the new updated data from Cohort 2 from clinical study in advanced melanoma. He cited the IOVA update in Jan. 2020 stating the median DOR for was still not reached at 15.1 months of follow-up. When CEO was asked if new duration of response had been reached and would be presented at ASCO, Maria said ""I'm not confirming in any way that a median DOR has been reached, but we are very excited about the data as a matter of fact""Awaiting Liftoff"
Should be back to 30s soon. Or higher given that the CEO that had a confrontational relationship with the FDA is gone and the positive data keeps rolling in.
"we had a major spike on thin volume. The good news, the market has not forgotten we are in play. The neutral news is all movements up or down are exaggerated. Still long and positive."
"Any predictions on what is said, or not said during next week’s conference call? If there is no update on the BLA then I think the stock gets hammered. We’ve all been patient, but this is getting old and people are losing confidence."

"Positive takeaways. First, mgmt. is smart enough to know what they have and I can almost guarantee that the $75 add on gets filled. So, secondly, they will have over $800 million in cash on the balance sheet. This is more than enough to go it alone for two years, but it also makes it an attractive target as a buyer doesn’t need to immediately fund their growth. This would make a buyer without a lot of cash interested, or a buyer who would rather do a stock deal. Either way IOVA is a very attractive target, probably not next week but likely within the next 12 months. Relax, have a great weekend. Patience will be rewarded."
So I just read that they may go it alone They only had one potential roadblock and that is future tech might be able to cut time in manufacturing TILs by using technology not tedious human technique but they are still optimistic I personally think that they want to get some approvals under their belt in 2021 so that they can demand a very high premium in a buyout . If they get 2 approvals the stock will be well over 100 and it will take a MAJOR pharma to buy them at a premium but may well be worth it if it changes the paradigm for treating and possibly curing some solid tumors Love n the end this could in 2 to 3 years be the largest takeover in biotech history But even if they go it alone it could be one of the companies that come along once in a decade or generation like Amgen was in the 80sEither way if the technology is a success most everyone on this board will be very happy GLTA
Eli lily announced today their intent to acquire at least one drug discovery company per quarter. We may be a bit expensive and too far down the line for them as they are looking for earlier stage companies for them as their target are companies between 1 and 5 billion acquisition price.

They raise another $350 million in preparation for commercialization of their products. Good news is they are able to raise the funds at these levels. Demonstrates confidence in the company's ability to bring its therapies to market. No doubt they are taking advantage of a strong market.
"H&N 2L data using Pembro showed an ORR of 15-18% vs. TIL plus Pembro of 44% (7/8 reduced burden). Pembro PFS is only a few months. TIL will beat that. NSCLC pivotal to start this year. CEO has said they can resolve this with the FDA. They believe their assay is ""gold standard"" by external experts. Still saying melanoma data before cervical (Q3 2021). The company will likely to be bought when data for other types can be projected into numbers that justify a premium. Not on initial rollout, which could have similar CAR-T issues."
This run to 41 was prompted by upgrade by the same brokerage house that was the underwriter of the secondary.Same old game --get price up--sell it after run up and prior to pricing announcement.This is a reasonable long term hold because of pipeline and trial results and I am adding to my position around 30.50 or lower for long term hold.
"Still lots of downside risk on this....When stocks are priced for perfection aka approval, this is what happens. The implications of this delay, that fda doesn’t agree with QC of the product shouldn’t be underestimated. This will take a while to resolve...."
#$%$s raised the firm's price target on Iovance Biotherapeutics to $53 from $44 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company reported Q2 results and affirmed guidance for a BLA filing for lifileucel in melanoma by the end of the year.
"Question for anyone here who might be knowledgeable in this field. There's another company, TIL, which apparently has this same platform. They are just beginning phase 2 later this year whereas IOVA has already finished phase 2. My question is why is TIL's trial results about twice as good as IOVA's if they use the same method? I own IOVA but I am wondering if I should also buy TIL."
"Wow, upgrades are coming!Mizuho initiates coverage of $IOVA with a Buy rating $61 PT. SIXTY ONE DOLLARS, that’s a nice start!"
Astellas just paid 100+ % premium ($3 Bil) for cell oncology company BOLD.I would think IOVA could be on someones Christmas shopping list. $50 a share minimum
"Iovance is the only company with a TIL approach in clinical trials. Unlike gene therapies that remove T-cells from a patient to reengineer them to spot blood cancers, TIL involves growing lymphocytes that have proven they can infiltrate a patient's solid tumor into large enough numbers so they can find and destroy cancer cells when they're returned to the patient. The company's already enrolling melanoma patients in a trial that can support FDA approval, and in July, the FDA said its ongoing phase 2 trial could support a filing in cervical cancer if successful. If data from these trials confirms what's been witnessed so far, then Iovance's treatments could offer new hope to thousands of solid tumor cancer patients by late 2020 or early 2021, making this an interesting stock to buy now."
"Great day to add to your position, imo. Sellers don’t even know why they are selling. This stock will come roaring back next week."
"This product addresses the huge unmet medical needs and the FDA has no choice but to Eventually move. Not saying any conspiracy theory, but now I have to wonder. Anyway good luck to all the longs who have suffered badly this year."
Iova is among the worst performing biotechs this year.
a logical rumor would could be framed as follows:IOVA has been in negotiations for a buyout over the past several weeks. That may explain why they have not issued shares pursuant to the S-1.
"In the words of IOVA's largest shareholder:“We believe that Iovance’s TILs will continue to be the most compelling therapy for solid tumors in the market and that Iovance has the most robust TIL data set,” the Cathie Wood-led firm said in a note to investors.“Furthermore, in our view, Iovance is trail-blazing the FDA regulatory process and likely will get FDA approval for its TIL therapy to treat melanoma, a very difficult-to-treat disease with high unmet need.”"
Stock action the last week suggests to me a buyout offer is in the near future.
What would you think is a realistic buyout price? This looks similar to IMMU which was bought out for roughly 20 bn
Even they somehow admit that TIL therapies address much unmet medical needs for a variety of cancer. The data continue to point this way.I have to believe now that they would have moved their #$%$ already and could have even close to approve it if this were from the likes of Pfizer or Merck. There is only so much you can penalize a small new comer and delay it that long. The data Iovance submitted to the FDA on the assay in the past is reasonable although not perfect. Anyway I think they have a very good shot of seeing them lifting things and move towards approval next year.
The date that IOVA released is outstanding . Duration of response continuing beyond 17 months is like hitting it out of the park . I believe this treatment will go frontline not too long after they get approval for the third line. This data also bodes well for the Phase 3 data expected to be released mid 2020
"Irrespective of a possible buyout, news is due soon. The answer to many diseases is in the healing properties of our own cells. A paradigm shift in medecine will go into high gear. IOVA will be one of the leaders in conquering the most insidious disease."

"Think that you have a new medicine here. Data looking increasingly good. See update below from Stiefel. It’s a biotech so need to be careful, but this is going one way! Also, if you want a side bet, check out UK listed Clin. They have only IL-2 that can be used and could see huge upside. Good luck!Heading into SITC, we had thought that a median DOR of greater than 1-year should represent a clear win for the stock- therefore we expect shares to outperform on today's news. We view the melanoma phase II, cohort-2, update at SITC has highly encouraging as we think the median duration of response (DOR) not being reached at 12.8 months implies treatment may be durable in a meaningful subset of patients. Additionally, an independent review committee's (IRC) assessment of the data continues to corroborate the previously disclosed results. As we had originally seen the use of an IRC as a potential risk to replicability in the registrational cohort-4 study, today's news assuages some of our concern here, and we are therefore increasing our probability of success (POS) for lifileucel in melanoma to 85% (from 75%) which raises our target price by $3 to $30/share. Reiterate Buy.Key PointsConsistent with the DOR as assessed by clinical trial investigators, the IRC also concluded that the median DOR hasn't yet been reached (though they are looking at a less mature dataset, with a median follow-up time of 11.3 months). As reported in the late-breaking abstract, the IRC found the ORR to be 35%, which is in line with the 36% ORR concluded by clinical trial investigators. On safety, AE's continue to look concentrated early on (we think this is likely because of the timing of IL-2 treatment and lymphodepletion), occurring with low frequency, and generally low grade longer term. One thing to note, there are two presentations of the same study to keep track of, one from the IRC and another from the clinical trial investigators - and each update is tracking at a different time point. As there is a finite turnaround time associated with submitting data to the IRC, and then getting the analyzed results back, the IRC-assessed data lag the investigator-assessed data by a couple of months."
Praying the Ms. Fardis will deliver news that will continue to press our stock to higher levels. Been in the stock since April of 2019. It is time for the entire paradigm in medicine to change with new and effective treatment for disease. The healing properties lie in our own cells. TIL should produce effective and safe therapies for a broad spectrum of solid tumors. IOVA is the progenitor and first to market.Good luck to everyone.
