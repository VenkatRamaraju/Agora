"Iovance will be first to market with a new first in class treatment. Hang on,be patient, and buy more."
We should be able to make up for the losses and more within the next 15 months. Their first approval really shoul happen by the end of 2022.
"Crazy to be down pre-market, the press release on manufacturing capabilities should have moved us higher."
Is IOVA pull-back an ALLO-effect? Luckily the volume is low.
"AGEN withdrew the Balstilimab AA filing in 2L cervical after the recent Keytruda approval. REGN's Libtayo will very likely gain approval in 2L soon, so will IOVA be able to file AA in the anti-PD-1 naïve setting even after resolving the essay issues?"
Pray for a buyout
"Bad for healthcare costs, but the failure of the recent prescription/pharma drug price controls to get through the House of Reps may bode well for IOVA, LYEL, BLUE, TCRX, TCRR and other adoptive immune cell therapy companies whose drug products are likely to be quite expensive."
"Keytruda had sales of $14.3B in 2020 for an medium increase in life expectancy of about 9 months. IOVA had not yet reached median survival. Margins are much less on biologics due to manufacturing, but this will be huge."
"Cathie Wood may be selling but this is more important:8-29-21 Medscape: Two Metastatic Lung Cancer Patients Are Disease-Free for 1.5 Years after TILs. ""Out of 16 patients, among 13 evaluable patients, 3 had confirmed responses and 11 had reduction in tumor burden. Two patients achieved complete responses that were ongoing 1.5 years following TIL treatment."" These are lung cancer patients with no other good options."
"here comes the flood of data. Next stop RCC , the first tumor to be treated with interleukin therapy"
"Ark sold another 500k plus of shares today. I know some of you think this is trimming, but they are buying FATE hand over fist. So, they are betting on another horse. Own both so I’m hoping both succeed."
"Why is FATE valued 1B more than IOVA when IOVA has great data in two cancers, has manufacturing and is only waiting on an assay for fda submission? FATE is only phase 1."

Ark still has a ton Only worry when they sell it all
"Well, load up people. I'm selling half my shares for some rebalancing, every time I do this, this price goes up, and no, it doesn't help if I wait. Gotta do it now. You're welcome!"
down the tube again this morning. Something is not right with this company.
About time this thing broke out.
Some of the traders definitely seem to know certain key issues ahead of time.
"Haven’t posted in several weeks. Looking for a positive? Take a look at the six month chart. Okay, We are coming off a miserable low @ $16 , but a nice slow build to $27. 68% up. Still, well off the $54 high. If we can get some news about a new CEO, maybe even a hint about assays, BLA, etc. then I think ( hope ) that we may be close to the 35-40 range by year end, maybe."
Probably up today just because over soldTIL is also up Once the assays are approved into the 40sThen with first 2 approvals 100 and then bought out for 200 after they keeping inching up to 130
