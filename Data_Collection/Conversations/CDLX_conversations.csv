Maybe someone can help me to understand.I've never understood (after 10 years investing) why sometimes - like with this company - how is possible that there are such bad news and the institutional are so high in %?% of Float Held by Institutions = almost 100%How is possible those in the know are so many?
O wow i didnt know i can mute people out! fantqastic option.
Could anyone explain how CDLX's business model is functioning? Company profile does not tell me much. Thanks
Anyone else think we are on the way to all time highs here?

"wow, what a quick mover! look at the 3 and 6 month chart here..."
"cdx is getting punished because they missed guidance for revenue. that means they're having issues with growth...it's not as good as they expected. that's a kiss of death for smaller growth phase oriented companies. I know if feels unfair given they still had positive earnings, but the market wants to see growth and gets very scared when smaller companies look like they're slowing down ."
"Am I the only person who read about this company and immediately thought of Google and Facebook, only with even more targeted marketing potential and a microscopic market cap?"

They run this stock up then down maximizing profits with little risk because the high frequency trading hedge fund runs it....deviously simple ...happens to work....they need you folks to load up so they can run it down some more...rinse and repeat
"selling overdone..once these shorts are forced to cover its going to 75, and to the next gap ups."

ZI new good investment
Time for a bounce?
Stock was priced for a big growth. But management is projecting growth and ceo is stepping down so the haircut is explained.
"This has potential to 30s in the near term. This is like $TTD and to some extent is better. Their clients BAC, Lloyds etc with Wells Fargo is going to be soon in the bag. They are expanding, not just Financial institutions, into retailers, restaurants etc. It will be interesting next few weeks and forming a nice base in the upper teens. May make a foray into the 20s soon."
I will get in if and when this stock closes it's downside gap set in 11/11/2019 at 39.64 especially in the condition the market is in!!!
"bought 10,000 shares at 16.50 yesterday,,, lets see by the end of the year where it goes"
This company isn't worth 10 bucks a share
https://discord.gg/PApSBSn
"When I first heard of this company, it reminded me of Google and Facebook, only with targeted advertising that could be more accurate. Did anybody else get the same feeling? I have tripled my investment in less than 2 years."
this stock is gonna have a major pullback soon. it's gained over 50 dollars in less than. month without even earnings coming out? yeah om
Should be good to go to the low 50s for a start
CRUSHED!!!
this is a 10 dollar stock tops
CDLX reached an all time high at 81.36
+40% in 2 days of trading !!!!!! Missed the bottom but have had a great cash ride from the low $30.00's back into the $40.00's. Awesome company and Thank goodness for that Stimulus plan providing a back stop for the economy and getting the stock market back on track !!!!.....
was it unethical for Cdlx insiders to sell so many shares prior to this ER? how can you not look at that and conclude they knew this was coming before everyone else?
Will bounce back by minimum of $3 tomorrow. Way too overreaction
I wonder how @Jim is doing with that 128 short...lol
Public Offering of Common Stock <-- is this mean we can buy more at $34?
Is this share reliable ? or Brokers are playing with share? i can't believe 30 percent up in one day and 30 percent down in next one day.
CDLX is up 18.11% to 34.83
I sold after holding for a yearish maybe less but bought at 18.90 sold at 21.70... now regretting ... It was either that one or KMI . Should I buy CDLX again at this price or buy more KMI shares ?
https://autumn.capital/2020/07/31/cardlytics-nasdaq-cdlx/
"well 110 is short target price for me, I just don't get how no one is talking about this thing moving up over 40% in like 5 trading days..."
Will get back into 70’s after conference call and people calm down!
"Buy at open tomorrow , great opportunity to get in cheep to a high growth company."
Nice test of breakoutReady to reverse and head up again over 100
the biggest conjob stock on the planet...lol...will short it soon

Cardlytics reached an all time high at 109.91

CDLX reached an all time high at 35.34
will it bounce tomorrow?
CDLX is up 19.57% to 47.65
"My opinion this is a risk off move. If you are holding CDLX before the earning release, you had a signfiicant profit. Once earnings were released, you have to pull profits. My two cents, more downside to come"
"The pressure of this stock has nothing to do with management in my opinion. It is all about dilution with a secondary offering , which has been a common practice with recent IPO's."
oh when to short...
 I got under 60
"The more you buy, The lower it goes, & The longer you hold, the more you’ll lose. Guaranteed!"
Very low volume not worried

It's nor even worth 10
CDLX reached an all time high at 99.90
What's wrong with this stock ? up 5$ on no news then down $10 on no news. Is it manipulated ?
Great buy. Going to 25
last time it went from over 100 to 25.....so you know
back to May 13 level
I'm tempted to buy today...
"FYI Longs!Dow recovered from a 600+ points loss and this PO$ remained down at it's lowest price of the day. Expect a GAP-DOWN open on Monday.I TOLD YOU TO SELL at 86, before the earnings, then in the 60's in the AH trading, then in high 50's and now in high 40s.If you hold, you'll only lose more."
Cardlytics is up 7.97% to 113.91
gap filled from august?
dont understand why it is significantly down
Gotta love the pre-market !
Why did the stock shoot up today?
one more small gap to fill from August 7 2019 at 27.41. That will mend the chart.
Was about time to deflate - buy CXM instead
Crushed Q3. Up 20% after hours.
"If it wasn't for the virus I would buy but nothing is normal so I will keep on the sidelines and wait for some good news. On a different note, all i see is tv people telling me not to buy a face mask because it is ineffective and then pictures from around the world and everyone including the traffic cops wearing them. The conflicting images are in sync with the stock market predictions it seems."
NEVER AGAIN over $65 before it hits 40's first.
"add 5000 shares, thank you , im short in this"
this stock will match BILL 's run

when to start trade?
Need more...when will the next buy opportunity be???
"Fire the CFO for poor management. They should have just met the current revenue expectations and deferred to the next quarter. The stock would still be down but at most 10% instead of a 30% overreaction. This market is relentless to the shorts all the way up, and now swung against the longs on the way down."
Wow. ARPU is down and will continue. Just slashed earnings growth to 19% YoY for next quarter. Slashed revenue guide from analyst estimates. Huge shake up in mgt. Will have dead cat bounce then head lower. Dead money and headed for the 30's.
"Looks like CDLX could be a target for M&A given strong growth, unique position, and sub $2b bite size."
A little vol expected. Plan to hold my position for years and a few hundred percent upside.
my post 9 days ago about the gap down here and it is filled.
52 week high of nothing but manipulation sweet!
They had some interesting insights about CDLX on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Hey Jerry how's that 55 buy going?...hehehe

"lawsuits will be on the way, needed to reannounce but didn't"
Why is this stock booming?
CDLX reached an all time high at 41.98
"Terrible guidance, they should have warned ahead of time ... $45M vs $52.77M expected ... That is a major drop-off. Had they deferred $5M worth of revenues, the miss wont be that much. I'm bailing at the dead cat bounce tomorrow. Hopefully bail at around 65 to 75 range."
CDLX reached an all time high at 47.65
Cardlytics reached an all time high at 144.33
If your lucky there will be support at 40
Why big jump tdday? Any news?
I was in from 38 in Oct to low 80s before selling. Back in as of today at $56. Very bright future longer term and very possibly a bite sized M&A target.
Kind of strange that CDLX / management team has issued any updates as to how the events surrounding Covid-19 has effected their business outlook. Seems most other public company's have shared some sort of update ! May it is just business as usual !!!!! :-)
"Just like it over shot to the upside it will over shoot to the downside. It go back to where it all started, even lower."
Why's this popping? Did I miss something?
oh look...the racketeering is still going....hmmmm ...when to short..?
"The more you Short, The higher it goes. $70 by next Friday. Stop the madness and cover before you lose more."
Trend has changed direction. I expect a negative reaction to whatever they report as earnings . I was long 2 months back but I’m now holding a SHORT position. $50-60 is a fair mkt value for this size company.
80’s next stop
offering is imminent
Gotta love those single share purchases to run the price up haha
NO STOCK HAS GONE SO LOW THAT CAN'T GO LOWER. SELL AND MOVE ON.CLOSE TODAY WILL BE UNDER $50
any idea on earnings 8n 30 mins
Looks like 100k shares traded in one block at 39.57 today.
If they can land a few more major banks contracts......
Any news leaking with pop 20% today and relatively larger shares changing hand?
such is life when it comes to small caps. no or slowing growth = punishment

Great quarter + guidance during a global pandemic -- and now at a big discount vs. last night's extended hours? Thanks very much! The nerds still don't understand that the ad industry is migrating to this company. $100 by year end.

@Jim...Why do you hang around this forum seems like you hate CDLX a bit much.
"At 1049am , 3800 and 4700 lots of buys went thru at 17.29 but the MMS are keeping it down. Accumulation going on."
$2 billion valuation for a company that grossed $28 million in revenue for the quarter?!?! This is one of the biggest bubble stocks around in the most bubbly market in decades.
"What are the expenses,losses"
$60.'s on the way ! :-)
"JIM ....How much are you down so far ?Just an FYI,The 3 day intra-day chart has formed a Flag Pattern.Hence, come Monday, expect a GAP-UP open over $60"
Never short a low flow stock like CDLX with large institutional holdings. The institutions can screw the retail investors badly.
"It has really held up well in the past two sessions with the EU tariff related news from the president. The analysts coverages, probably news about Wells Fargo from trial to adoption, other positive news from the company etc should propel us from here."
why no press release on JPM????
This stock is a get in get out daily if not weekly!I am in when it hits 50.00 and it will
CDLX announces that barring a recession that someday they may make a few cents a share profit in a year....but don't count on it...LMAO
"Officially, CDLX shot aload today. It will roll over and fall asleep tomorrow."
"New ALL-TIME high on a DOWN-DAY. That says it all. Keep shorting it. Yeap, you'll surely get rewarded."
Cardlytics is down 29.86% to 60.46
Hourly average volume is trending downward. Not a good sign
"Cardlytics is a short-term pain, fundamentals remain intact, growth should return by second half of this year. Buying in lower teens is a good strategy if this mayhem continues which I believe will not end soon."
DO NOT HOLD. YOU CAN ALWAYS BUY IT BACK AT A LOWER PRICE.

It has established the solid base in the upper 17s and low 18s. We should break thru into the 20s by end of week.

Buy before earnings?
"I think we found the base in the low 17s. With the upcoming analysts (ML, JPM, Raymond James, KeyBanc, Wells Fargo, Suntrust et al) coverages on March 5th, this should expect a lift in anticipation. TTD had a stellar report and forward guidance augurs well for this sector. I am expecting their targets will be in the range of 25 to 35 pps."

Wow...! Down even after positive earnings
