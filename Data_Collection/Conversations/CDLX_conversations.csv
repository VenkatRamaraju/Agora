"The more you Short, The higher it goes. $70 by next Friday. Stop the madness and cover before you lose more."
one more small gap to fill from August 7 2019 at 27.41. That will mend the chart.
what a Great company. I have a few hundred shares & with all the good news & the shorts beginning to panic I am going to buy more.
And here we go again -- another dip opportunity from the street! Thanks very much for the discount!
wow!
"jim.....why so negative ! Did you get fired from Cardlytics or something. This is a stud of a company..... yes the price got way ahead of it self but this is the time to jump in at a very reasonable price. The technology is in credible, their moat is un-catch-able and they are already MAKING MONEY ! Not to mention... No doubt a Take-Over Target........ Stop being that grumpy get off my lawn guy, get on board now and make sum money ! Let's Go CDLX !"
"What are the earnings going to look like? What's everyone thinking on earnings predictions, catalyst for stock or further drop ahead?"
Is this share reliable ? or Brokers are playing with share? i can't believe 30 percent up in one day and 30 percent down in next one day.
Nice test of breakoutReady to reverse and head up again over 100
I only have 25 shares of this that I bought in 2019. But perspective for longs: we are still up 35 percent vs. last year at $90. And we are 3.5 higher than we were on this date in 2019.
need a gap to buy 
Seriously what the hell is up with this stock as soon as I place an order the price changes
NO STOCK HAS GONE SO LOW THAT CAN'T GO LOWER. SELL AND MOVE ON.CLOSE TODAY WILL BE UNDER $50

Any news leaking with pop 20% today and relatively larger shares changing hand?
52 week high of nothing but manipulation sweet!
They had some interesting insights about CDLX on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
 I got under 60
profit margins are far below peers. Any insights?
Support level holding up
It has established the solid base in the upper 17s and low 18s. We should break thru into the 20s by end of week. With the analyst coverages starting next week should give more confidence and insights about this company. The below should help in further determining your decision. Cardlytics: A Prime Opportunity In The Digital Advertising Boom $CDLXhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4151066-cardlytics-prime-opportunity-digital-advertising-boom
I wonder how @Jim is doing with that 128 short...lol
earnings tomorrow! hopefully on another big pop like these past 2 days
10 to 107 in 15 months and you weren't suspicious?
Another 5% day
Kind of strange that CDLX / management team has issued any updates as to how the events surrounding Covid-19 has effected their business outlook. Seems most other public company's have shared some sort of update ! May it is just business as usual !!!!! :-)
"The more you buy, The lower it goes, & The longer you hold, the more you’ll lose. Guaranteed!"
CDLX is down -8.87% to 19.21
Lord help me
Loading up RIGHT NOW !!!!! 2 weeks from know it will all be........... I Could-a... I should-a ........ wahhhhhh but I didn't !
"My opinion this is a risk off move. If you are holding CDLX before the earning release, you had a signfiicant profit. Once earnings were released, you have to pull profits. My two cents, more downside to come"
"Don't like the high beta, coming in 10-15% shortly. Hold long term or get out now for a quick double digit gain. Jmo"
"If it wasn't for the virus I would buy but nothing is normal so I will keep on the sidelines and wait for some good news. On a different note, all i see is tv people telling me not to buy a face mask because it is ineffective and then pictures from around the world and everyone including the traffic cops wearing them. The conflicting images are in sync with the stock market predictions it seems."

CDLX reached an all time high at 86.54
Fidelity loves it as they own 10%
Buy before earnings?
CDLX is down -9.98% to 18.41
Buy anything for 32 and sell 35
Great Resistance with high volume at $55. Sorry to disappoint you once again SHORTIES.
They run this stock up then down maximizing profits with little risk because the high frequency trading hedge fund runs it....deviously simple ...happens to work....they need you folks to load up so they can run it down some more...rinse and repeat
Could anyone explain how CDLX's business model is functioning? Company profile does not tell me much. Thanks
Up 34% pre market huh
Look at that chart...59 bucks a share down in 14 days...hahahaha
Where's irish and Nebraska now that it's going into the 30s?
"bought 10,000 shares at 16.50 yesterday,,, lets see by the end of the year where it goes"
I luv when shorties get toasted.... hahah
STILL worth $1.6 billion. That is A LOT of money people. For a company that has NEVER grossed more than $40 million a quarter in REVENUE. BUBBLE DENIERS ARE FUNNY.
"Looks like CDLX could be a target for M&A given strong growth, unique position, and sub $2b bite size."
Gotta love those single share purchases to run the price up haha
"When I first heard of this company, it reminded me of Google and Facebook, only with targeted advertising that could be more accurate. Did anybody else get the same feeling? I have tripled my investment in less than 2 years."

Was about time to deflate - buy CXM instead
80’s next stop
Love IT.Bag holders...
"FYI Longs!Dow recovered from a 600+ points loss and this PO$ remained down at it's lowest price of the day. Expect a GAP-DOWN open on Monday.I TOLD YOU TO SELL at 86, before the earnings, then in the 60's in the AH trading, then in high 50's and now in high 40s.If you hold, you'll only lose more."
dont understand why it is significantly down
filling the earnings gap. lets get some big green volume here! GLTA longs!!
Will bounce back by minimum of $3 tomorrow. Way too overreaction
Never short a low flow stock like CDLX with large institutional holdings. The institutions can screw the retail investors badly.
$60.'s on the way ! :-)
Like I said they will now make money on the way down till you puke out your shares
I'm tempted to buy today...
I sold after holding for a yearish maybe less but bought at 18.90 sold at 21.70... now regretting ... It was either that one or KMI . Should I buy CDLX again at this price or buy more KMI shares ?
Looks like Jim-Bob lost his shorts/ Big time. See red emoji with sweat dripping

Wow...! Down even after positive earnings
A little vol expected. Plan to hold my position for years and a few hundred percent upside.

CDLX reached a new All Time High at 28.23
Maybe someone can help me to understand.I've never understood (after 10 years investing) why sometimes - like with this company - how is possible that there are such bad news and the institutional are so high in %?% of Float Held by Institutions = almost 100%How is possible those in the know are so many?
CDLX is down 7.39% to $23.19
This has to be one of the most extreme negative overreactions I've ever seen in a stock. Once the dust settles this stock will be going up up and away again 
Wow....I am speechless with today's decline of around 37% at this writing.
Breakout to 80’s
"At 1049am , 3800 and 4700 lots of buys went thru at 17.29 but the MMS are keeping it down. Accumulation going on."
Todays' news: Google is about to phase out enabling cookie use by marketers over hrte next 24 months ....means even more opportuniothy for cdlx? I'd guess so. Will find out soon enough if and when analysts have their say....
I will get in if and when this stock closes it's downside gap set in 11/11/2019 at 39.64 especially in the condition the market is in!!!
Concerns on the light trading volumes?
"cdx is getting punished because they missed guidance for revenue. that means they're having issues with growth...it's not as good as they expected. that's a kiss of death for smaller growth phase oriented companies. I know if feels unfair given they still had positive earnings, but the market wants to see growth and gets very scared when smaller companies look like they're slowing down ."
CDLX is down 9.46% to $12.25
If your lucky there will be support at 40
"selling overdone..once these shorts are forced to cover its going to 75, and to the next gap ups."
The daily volumes are slowly fading into nothingness..still bullish
nobody commenting on this stock it must still be a pretty early stage stock?. usually boards are cluttered with shorts and spam?!
"Yeah enter little bit early, but bought only 75 shares, thank god"
I'm loading up today after a 25% gain. Thx guys
Wow. ARPU is down and will continue. Just slashed earnings growth to 19% YoY for next quarter. Slashed revenue guide from analyst estimates. Huge shake up in mgt. Will have dead cat bounce then head lower. Dead money and headed for the 30's.
Anyone else think we are on the way to all time highs here?
GAP to $40 IS NOW EMINENT.DO NOT BUY OR HOLD.ONLY SELL.
If they can land a few more major banks contracts......
$2 billion valuation for a company that grossed $28 million in revenue for the quarter?!?! This is one of the biggest bubble stocks around in the most bubbly market in decades.
CDLX is on buyout list for Google / Apple and Microsoft and others for data analytics /marketing s software
Could see a STMP move into earnings here
This company isn't worth 10 bucks a share
Trend has changed direction. I expect a negative reaction to whatever they report as earnings . I was long 2 months back but I’m now holding a SHORT position. $50-60 is a fair mkt value for this size company.
Why's this popping? Did I miss something?
gap filled from august?
Revenue declined 18.3% Last year revenue $210M this year $174-181guidanceLast year stock was trading at $35 now trading at $82 after hourAnalysts will upgrade CDLX tomorrow if someone buy them a lunch or $100 cash I am hoping this will pop in the morning We need a upgrade tomorrow

"Cramer likes it... 'nough said. ....... But that Forward P/E at 1,551 !!!!!!https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CDLX/key-statistics?p=CDLX"
"Terrible guidance, they should have warned ahead of time ... $45M vs $52.77M expected ... That is a major drop-off. Had they deferred $5M worth of revenues, the miss wont be that much. I'm bailing at the dead cat bounce tomorrow. Hopefully bail at around 65 to 75 range."
offering is imminent
Wild drop... the stock jumped above this level form below $40 to above $56 on a November 13 earnings beat and then proceeded to break above $100 recently. This drop is way overdone in my opinion.
"Another 52 wk high off nothing excellent, at least all the technicals point to a breakdown to $90.25"
"Should I sell or hold, up 40%..."
Jumped on the IPO...sold off a few and holding some for the long haul. Let's go CDLX.
Need more...when will the next buy opportunity be???
"Fire the CFO for poor management. They should have just met the current revenue expectations and deferred to the next quarter. The stock would still be down but at most 10% instead of a 30% overreaction. This market is relentless to the shorts all the way up, and now swung against the longs on the way down."
wow wow wow glad i tracked this through the pandemic!
Tech Leader. Data is $.
"SHORT MORE, IF YOU CAN FIND SHARES.THE GAP TO $40 WILL BE FILLED BEFORE ANY BOUNCE BACKs."

Big beat on REV!
"wow, what a quick mover! look at the 3 and 6 month chart here..."
why no press release on JPM????
Public Offering of Common Stock <-- is this mean we can buy more at $34?
"http://ir.cardlytics.com/node/6946/html Fidelity Small Cap Growth Fund announces a 15% stake in CDLX. 3 million shares, almost half the current float."
Hourly average volume is trending downward. Not a good sign
Great buy. Going to 25
WATCH it closely and SHORT it on every POP. This stock is not going anywhere but down.
What's wrong with this stock ? up 5$ on no news then down $10 on no news. Is it manipulated ?
"Cardlytics is a short-term pain, fundamentals remain intact, growth should return by second half of this year. Buying in lower teens is a good strategy if this mayhem continues which I believe will not end soon."
Looks like 100k shares traded in one block at 39.57 today.
"This has potential to 30s in the near term. This is like $TTD and to some extent is better. Their clients BAC, Lloyds etc with Wells Fargo is going to be soon in the bag. They are expanding, not just Financial institutions, into retailers, restaurants etc. It will be interesting next few weeks and forming a nice base in the upper teens. May make a foray into the 20s soon."
It's nor even worth 10
Buy buy buy this is a very good company I live next door in Atlanta . Once vaccine is approved this will fly along with finance
when to start trade?
ZI will up $100 by September

"It has really held up well in the past two sessions with the EU tariff related news from the president. The analysts coverages, probably news about Wells Fargo from trial to adoption, other positive news from the company etc should propel us from here."
was it unethical for Cdlx insiders to sell so many shares prior to this ER? how can you not look at that and conclude they knew this was coming before everyone else?
CDLX reached an all time high at 68.73
"Nice dip opportunity on low volume. Touched $80 earlier, and heading back above soon."
"I think we found the base in the low 17s. With the upcoming analysts (ML, JPM, Raymond James, KeyBanc, Wells Fargo, Suntrust et al) coverages on March 5th, this should expect a lift in anticipation. TTD had a stellar report and forward guidance augurs well for this sector. I am expecting their targets will be in the range of 25 to 35 pps."
With todays negative pre market sentiment hoping we slip back down closer to $40.00 for another buying opportunity..... Playing the market swings here has been awesome ! :-) Keep the junk coming !
Blowout earnings tomorrow and forecast! Watch for TTD type move
Get ready for another buying opportunity ! Love this stock.....
Great quarter + guidance during a global pandemic -- and now at a big discount vs. last night's extended hours? Thanks very much! The nerds still don't understand that the ad industry is migrating to this company. $100 by year end.
Will get back into 70’s after conference call and people calm down!
I was in from 38 in Oct to low 80s before selling. Back in as of today at $56. Very bright future longer term and very possibly a bite sized M&A target.
Stock was priced for a big growth. But management is projecting growth and ceo is stepping down so the haircut is explained.
CDLX announces that barring a recession that someday they may make a few cents a share profit in a year....but don't count on it...LMAO
Not loss attributed to shareholders Q1 increased 84% to $25MM. See page 15 of their slide deck for q1. This company is a disaster...run from it!
