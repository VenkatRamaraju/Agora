"September 13, 2017 - Press Release MACIVIVA...Mymetics to Present New Preclinical Data on Thermostable andCold-Chain Independent Virosome based VaccinesEpalinges, Switzerland, September 13, 2017 – Mymetics Corporation (OTCQB: MYMX), a pioneer inthe research and development of virosome-based vaccines to prevent transmission of humaninfectious diseases, announced today that they will present new preclinical data. The new datademonstrates that nasal powder, oral capsules and sublingual tablets developed by MACIVIVApartners, containing Mymetics HIV-1 virosome based vaccine candidate, could induce specificantibody immune response in rodent and mini-pig animal models.The results are generated under the MACIVIVA project, an EU Horizon 2020 project, which stands for“Manufacturing process for Cold-chain Independent Virosome-based Vaccines”. The project startedin May 2015, with a duration of total 3.5 years and brings together leading contract manufacturersand the relevant expertise for spray drying, freeze drying and analytical techniques from thepharmaceutical industry to develop a scalable manufacturing process to achieve thermostable andcold-chain independent virosome based vaccines.The new preclinical data will be presented at three upcoming events. 12 – 14 September, 2017: Modern Vaccines Adjuvants & Delivery Systems, Porto, Portugal. 16 – 18 September, 2017: ILS Liposome Advances & Liposome Research, Athens, Greece. 10 – 12 October, 2017: World Vaccine Congress Europe, Barcelona, Spain.The preliminary results are showing that spray drying and lyophilization may conserve the virosomestructure and antigens during the manufacturing process. Preclinical studies showed that MymeticsHIV-1 vaccine candidate, after being downstream processed into different powder solid dosage forms,could trigger specific antibodies, which were variable depending on the formulation. Antibodies werequantified in serum, nasal washes, vaginal washes and feces by the immuno-PCR Imperacer assays.Although this is a first study, the manufacturing process and vaccine formulations will needoptimization prior moving forward into GMP development, the data are promising for achievingthermostable and cold-chain independent virosome based vaccines.About MymeticsMymetics Corp.

"NEWS! Mymetics Presents New Data Regarding Cold Chain Independent Virosome Based Vaccines $MYMX, $CTLTEPALINGES, SWITZERLAND / ACCESSWIRE / November 14, 2018 / Mymetics Corporation (MYMX), a pioneer and leader in the research and development of virosome-based vaccines against life-threatening and life disabling diseases, announces that new data is presented today by Mymetics at the annual Mucosal Vaccines, Adjuvants and Delivery meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.Since 2015, Mymetics has been leading a consortium to develop thermostable and cold-chain independent virosome-based vaccines. The project, named MACIVIVA, is funded as part of Horizon 2020, the European Union research and innovation framework program and by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), and has a total grant value of €8.4 million. With the MACIVIVA project, Mymetics has brought together the leading contract manufacturers and the relevant expertise for spray drying, freeze drying and analytical techniques from the pharmaceutical industry.The late breaker presentation today, titled ""Thermostable Virosome-based Vaccines Under New Solid Dosage Forms"" will be presented by Dr. Sylvain Fleury, Mymetics' CSO.Dr. Fleury will present data showing that Mymetics' HIV virosome-based candidate vaccine was successfully transformed into dry powder and into sublingual tablets. These new solid dosage forms were stored at 1 to 3 month time intervals at 4°C (40°F), 25°C (77°F) and 40°C (104°F) and the vaccine candidate maintained its structural integrity, while the liquid formulation showed structural degradation at 25°C (77°F) and 40°C (104°F). In pre-clinical in vivo studies, the nasal delivery of spray dried virosomes and oral delivery of the sublingual tablet showed to be a possible effective, needle-free route for immunization, triggering immune responses in not only the serum, but also in the mucosal immune compartments.The MACIVIVA project will end this November 2018 and may receive up to €5.3 million funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No 646122.These promising results allow Mymetics to apply for new grants and possible collaborations to further advance its virosome-based vaccines into clinical development, in particular, its HIV-1 vaccine candidate.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mymetics-presents-data-regarding-cold-093500261.html"

"MACIVIVA partner Upperton tweeted:""Received our latest delivery of #virosomes for the #MACIVIVA project. This project is funded by the #EU to improve the stability and shelf-life of vaccines #formulationdevelopment #vaccines #WednesdayMotivation""https://twitter.com/UppertonLtd/status/1042338397564661763Periodic Reporting for period 2 - MACIVIVA (MAnufacturing process for Cold-chain Independent VIrosome-based VAccines)Reporting period: 2016-11-04 to 2017-11-03Liquid vaccines contain high water content (>80%), which explains in part their instability during the storage. Therefore, maintenance of the cold chain is fundamental for preserving the bioactivity of vaccines. However, many regions of developing countries also lack electricity and cooling capability for keeping vaccines below +8°C. MACIVIVA stands for “Manufacturing process for Cold-chain Independent Virosome-based Vaccines”. It is a 42 months project supported by the EU Horizon 2020 (Consortium grant agreement No 646122) and the Swiss government, involving four European and two Swiss partners. The main objective is to transform existing cold chain-dependent liquid virosome-based vaccines into new solid thermostable powder forms that can sustain storage temperature outside the cold chain. MACIVIVA Consortium will develop new GMP manufacturing processes and Pilot lines by heat spray drying and freeze-drying for obtaining these new dry powders vaccines suitable for needle-free vaccination by mucosal routes: Sublingual tablets, oral capsules and intranasal sprays. These new powder vaccines will allow to support high and low temperature excursions outside the recommended cold chain conditions and may greatly simplify the logistics. The development of new solid vaccine forms will be tested first with a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate based on conserved HIV-1 gp41-derived antigens anchored together with adjuvants at the surface of the same influenza virosomes, which are enveloped virus-like particles (VLPs) mimicking the influenza virus structure. If successful, other virosome-based vaccines could be formulated as powder forms. GMP improved manufacturing processes are developed by the partner Bachem AG (Switzerland) for the vaccinal peptide antigen P1, and by the subcontractor PX’Therapeutics (France) for the recombinant gp41 protein. Mymetics SA (Switzerland) provides the starting liquid virosome-based vaccines for downstream processing into solid forms. Upperton Ltd. (United Kingdom) will explore the development of two manufacturing processes: Spray-dried nasal powder for nasal spray devices, and oral enteric coated capsules. Catalent UK Swindon Zydis Ltd (United Kingdom) will explore freeze-drying process for making Zydis sublingual tablets. Mymetics BV (The Netherlands) will evaluate the virosome properties of the liquid and solid vaccine forms. Chimera Biotec GmbH (Germany) will develop new and different Imperacer immunoassays for monitoring various animal species antibody response in serums and different mucosal secretions.Work performed from the beginning of the project to the end of the period covered by the report and main results achieved so farBachem and PX’Therapeutics have successfully optimized their GMP process and delivered respectively the GMP P1 and rgp41. Mymetics SA has manufactured different virosome formulations and batches, which were distributed among the partners. Through appropriate selection of excipients and their concentration levels, Catalent and Upperon have identified formulation compositions, together with several process parameters for achieving the optimal “recipe” and manufacturing process. Catalent can now produce Zydis freeze dried tablets of physically acceptable characteristics suitable for sublingual delivery, with lead candidate formulations identified for animal testing and human use. Upperton developed the nasal spray-dried powder suitable for nasal delivery with the selected nasal device for human use. The lead oral vaccine powder formulation was also developed for loading enteric coated capsule to allow dissolution in the gastrointestinal tract. It remains to select the most appropriate capsule size and polymer composition for human use. After downstream processing from liquid to these solid vaccine forms, analyses confirmed that virosome structure and antigens were preserved.The presence of certain excipients.....https://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/194900_en.html"

"" The presence of certain excipients in the new vaccine solid forms, together with a new manufacturing process may potentially alter the virosome properties and reduce the vaccine immunogenicity. Prior launching GMP production, Mymetics conducted limited exploratory studies for addressing some of these immunological aspects in laboratory assays, complemented by animal studies for monitoring virosome migration and their ability to elicit antibodies, all conducted in 2016-2017. Overall, the three new solid powder vaccine forms (oral, sublingual and nasal) did not prevent virosome uptake by dendritic cells and migration to the draining lymph nodes, harboring suitable immune-competence properties comparable to the original liquid vaccine.""Progress beyond the state of the art and expected potential impact (including the socio-economic impact and the wider societal implications of the project so far).........https://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/194900_en.html"
"MACIVIVA Report:""From May 2015 to October 2016 (M1-M18), all six MACIVIVA partners have closely collaborated together to achieve the project milestones and objectives set for this period. During the downstream processing from liquid to solid dosage forms, various analyses on virosomes were performed to make sure that they retain their original physical and biological properties after formulation as sublingual tablet, nasal spray and oral capsule. Mymetics SA had produced 12 different virosome fomulations during the first 18 months of the project, which were distributed among Upperton, Catalent, Chimera and Mymetics SA/BV. Catalent and Upperon have then evaluated various buffers and excipients for identifying the most suitable one for preserving the initial virosome structure, antigens and pH, respective to their own manufacturing process. Several manufacturing process parameters were investigated and optimized.""""Through appropriate selection of excipients and their concentration levels, in conjunction with the manufacturing conditions, Zydis freeze dried tablets of physically acceptable characteristics could be obtained for the prototype sublingual formulation. Catalent can produce various tablet sizes and current data are suggesting that the dose weight of 500 mg prior to freeze drying (approximately 100 mg freeze dried tablet) tablet could be the lead candidate formulation. Similarly for nasal and oral formulation, excipients were selected for generating powder with suitable physical properties. For nasal formulation, an excipient was also added to the formulation for fulfilling the role of mucoadhesive molecule. This will allow the virosomes to reside longer at the nasal mucosa tissue and optimize activation of the immune system. At Upperton the spray drying process was also optimized for the nasal formulation for generating particle powders that would have a size above 10 m to avoid lung depot after nasal delivery. A nasal device, 100% plastic derived material, was selected. The homogeneity of the emitted powder dose was evaluated and results have confirmed previous studies showing its reliability for delivery of the expected dose."""
