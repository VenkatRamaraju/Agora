"Few people seem to know Catalent has Lofexidine a prescription drug popular in Europe, but only recently approved here to relieve symptoms of Opiate withdrawal. Seems like the demand could be huge."
Amazing earnings beat and guidance
MRNA manufacturing....
"Folks, remember that if a vaccine is approved it has to be manufactured to scale. This is a piece of the puzzle "

Sell and buy back at $110
Invested yesterday. This name is trading well below its 3 to 5 year price potential. Expecting the stock price to ramp up over the next few months.
Beat on both ways! Pretty strong revenue and bright future!
I read the operation warp speed documents on the web again and CTLT has several contracts to manufacture. I didn’t realize Corning is making glass for vials too. EBS and TMO also working on vaccine initiatives/ manufacturing. WST has syringes etc so I assume maybe w good play. Any other tertiary companies???
How will the company eliminate all the debt? Isn't that a huge issue? or am I wrong? Thanks
CTLT involved with the distribution of the the PFE and MRNA vaccines
"this may be a good company, but ""all time high"" is NEVER when you want to buy a stock; any stock. Let this pull back for a while first. ""Buy LOW""!!!!"

"Amazing how two stock treated completely differently.$TSLA S&P 500 inclusion hoax (Which done by fraud street very openly and yet no one even asking to inquire about clearly & perfectly coordinated stuff which not possible without billions on table by powerful group.) bring it 50% higher in just few days.$ETSY hardly moving$TER hardly moving$CTLT hardly moving.Amazing yesterday they gone solid negative as well similar to other stock. First trading day.What S&P 500 inclusion means nearly 30% of stock get brought by various different fund (14% directly by ETF /Other funds tracking S&P 500 100% accurately, Other 19% also try match S&P 500 performance but not always follow 100% so I put 30% total.)"
"This one along $ETSY $CTLT added to stock market. And Expensive Fraudulent $TSLA left out (Sorry can't stop to comment there)I am very familiar with $ETSY. While I didn't invest until now as I always think price entry after earning and it didn't reach there, go higher instead. It's great company and good for long term holding. With S&P 500 inclusion, they now going to much more appreciate. It's unique eCommerce and help many artist sell stuff.$TER seems very good reasonably price growth stock involved in AI/ Robotics as well. Again very good long term holding. You might buying for S&P 500 inclusion but don't sell unless you have to.. In any case don't sell profit part.$CTLT is biotech related. While growing slow it's solidly profitable. I will research more and post finding as well."
