"Sleeper baby. No one is paying attention to these guys, but they quietly have a number of products that are up 10-30% year-over-year and if you look at the quarterly reports, some large increases in both inventory, and property, plant and equipment, without taking on too much debt. Primatene Mist product release this year also giving good profit margins, and so far sales look excellent.Like this company a lot. We'll see what happens."

Looks like the first part of the Patent infringement trial is over -goes to the jury- do they call BS on the whole deal or do they award something to Momenta. If they call the suit BS look for some gain going forward for AMPH- the trial set for 2019 is for anti competition against Momenta and a win now will strengthen that case/IMO. If the jury awards Momenta look for appeal. The lawyers just keep on winning either way.
