highly respect her T/A for both targets and which way you lean bullish or bearish.Mellisa_scott.
MLM is up 4.99% to $161.08
This is going to 400 after the infrastructure deal
n Sept Barron's wrote a very bullish article about the rock and cement stocks..Summit was over $19.00 and today it's near $14.00. If Barron's is correct these stocks CX/MLM/VCM and SUM are all buys..In my opinion......
MLM reached an all time high at 267.35

"AND the material - all big rock - came from MLM pits not only from those 4 states. Material was coming in from the south, east & west by the Railways & unloaded down in St. Joe, Missouri, in the stock yards. With that said, as soon as a shipment was unloaded or in some cases we loaded right off of the cars. With load on trucks headed north to designated sites. Perfectly coordinated . . ."
"Not sure how much aggregate is shipped to China, but I'm guessing its 0. Can't figure out the continued decline in MLM and VMC."
Why again is this tanking? Beat Revenue. Beat EPS..
What a steal earlier this morning

"Yup, 2 trillion infrastructure  coming MLM's way. Bridges, roads, RR, ect . . ."
Maybe the selling after earnings is done and MLM will start trading up. I hope so.
"That was a nice run the past few weeks. I guess the market is convinced we will have a new president, higher taxes, higher debt and big infrastructure spend."

"In Barron's November 27, 2017, Rebuilding Hopes in Infrastructure Stocks. ""This could be massive for this industry,"" says Philip Ng, who covers building-products and construction-materials stocks for Jefferies.*LOOKS like time to up your FRTA long positions...* Under the radar FRTA the #1 water, drainage, products company in the United States...Hal thinks an infrastructure bill can pass Congress in some form.""Trump is a builder at heart, and he knows this topic,"" she says. ""I think this bill will at least get out of the gate.""Article mentions: $CAT $MLM $ACM $GVA $EXP $USCRDems & Rep all want good roads, etc."
Great quarter. MLM continues to deposit money into my retirement account. The naysayers on this stock are in over their heads. Infrastructure is going to be a major target of the Biden administration and that only means higher prices for MLM.
"Ahhh, a nice quiet MB. Started adding a position here, price seems poised to lift. I've hauled out of many of their pits. Last spring we ran 2 months straight down in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa & S Dakota shoring up the Railway & Roads. Really interesting runs. GD people down there that was experiencing a devastation."

"NO BRAINER -- MLM is the largest provider of cement, gravel, paving stones and paving chemicals-varnishes in the country. Its forward PE is 25, and its 10% off its highs. If we really ARE going into an expanding economy (and not a recession) this is a $450. stock. Easy call."

"Still losing money on this, but bought more today. Off 4 cents EPS estimate, but the stock is getting hammered -12% from close yesterday. Even if Trump wins, we still need infrastructure plus more storms are on the way."
Shorting MLM with an incoming infrastructure deal is like beating yourself over the head with a hammer to relieve your migraine. It's so obvious you shouldn't do it. I am buying MLM and the other builders right now. They are growing in extremely fertile soil right now.

MLM has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. Im not sure about you guys but https://pennystockplatform.blogspot.com/ has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
Given Washington’s plan for infrastructure Martin Marietta is a strong buy here.

"I'd always wanted to own this company but it was fairly valued for so long. Thanks to the virus I finally got my chance and currently am enjoying an 18% return. Those who look at this virus as a curse need to be reminded that it gives people opportunities to own stocks cheaply. I look forward to watching this return to pre-virus levels, now as an owner of the shares."

"Extremely Point by Point Video Well I will also say this here, Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" just has the current markets is down. Holding is great, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyze the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Mrs Mellisa_scott services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Mellisa_scott , she is always one step ahead of other traders, she fully monitored all my trades to avoid making me mistakes and losing my funds. My earnings has increased from 2 BTC to 19 BTC in just 11 weeks and some days. I have full confidence in her trading abilities, Mrs mellisa_scott can be reached the On Telegram (@ Mellisa_scott) be guided."

Is the acquisition good or bad?
It's funny to me that Marvin immediately erased his last post. I'm surprised that he even caught the 2% drop an the media by back. Just further demonstrates he has no idea what hes talking about. Just move on my friend your wasting time here.
Encore Wire (WIRE) nearly quadrupled in the year following Katrina.

"Gotta love the stock market. Companies that miss estimates and lower forecasts go up and companies (MLM, URI and many others) beat estimates and raise guidance and their stocks get creamed. No one says the market makes any sense, but stock movements after earnings are a coin flip.We'll see what happens when VMC reports on 7/31. They should be optimistic like MLM."
Why the drop after hours?
