Was able to understand the candlesticks in charts better from Mellisa_scott.
Will this hurricane (and infrastructure damage) affect the price of MLM?
Invested in MLM in March and now have a massive 85 percent return. I think this will go back above 300 and eventually take out 400. This company is a giant and a winner.
"That was a nice run the past few weeks. I guess the market is convinced we will have a new president, higher taxes, higher debt and big infrastructure spend."
"With all the positives for domestic materials companies, I cant believe how much MLM and VMC have fallen in the past 3 days. Bought more on the dip."
"NO BRAINER -- MLM is the largest provider of cement, gravel, paving stones and paving chemicals-varnishes in the country. Its forward PE is 25, and its 10% off its highs. If we really ARE going into an expanding economy (and not a recession) this is a $450. stock. Easy call."
Tsp is great.martin marietta gave me 3 shares for emp. Of year. Now have 103. Great run invest. Was contact rep at TSP for 12 years. Learned a lot. USDA used to be in charge.
Is the acquisition good or bad?
Bring back what I learned in ECON class....after a downturn typically infrastructure spending increases. I wouldn't expect anything different this year. Add $VMC $MLM $CAT $DE to my watchlist. They will benefit if this becomes reality.
Approval of bull would raise this stock to 500
This will make you 50% money by Next year at this time. Money back Guaranttee.

"AND the material - all big rock - came from MLM pits not only from those 4 states. Material was coming in from the south, east & west by the Railways & unloaded down in St. Joe, Missouri, in the stock yards. With that said, as soon as a shipment was unloaded or in some cases we loaded right off of the cars. With load on trucks headed north to designated sites. Perfectly coordinated . . ."
Earnings don’t matter. Infrastructure deal will make this stock go to 500
Is it time to buy ??
"Once they finish with the tax bill, it is on finally to infrastructure. Will be great for MLM."
"I can't figure out the daily pricing changes in MLM. Up and down +4 with no news. Good to trade, but overall running in place. Prospects must be really good if the weather stays dry."
"great beat on this quarter . . . however, on to the next, which should see a bigger profit . . ."
A Biden win will cause this stock to jump into the 300s. Infrastructure play is what Biden is about
Given Washington’s plan for infrastructure Martin Marietta is a strong buy here.
TOld you it would be 220 by this summer. See post 2 months ago....
highly respect her T/A for both targets and which way you lean bullish or bearish.Mellisa_scott.
Shorting MLM with an incoming infrastructure deal is like beating yourself over the head with a hammer to relieve your migraine. It's so obvious you shouldn't do it. I am buying MLM and the other builders right now. They are growing in extremely fertile soil right now.

"Ahhh, a nice quiet MB. Started adding a position here, price seems poised to lift. I've hauled out of many of their pits. Last spring we ran 2 months straight down in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa & S Dakota shoring up the Railway & Roads. Really interesting runs. GD people down there that was experiencing a devastation."
400 is coming
This will rise to 400 with infrastructure deal
"Gotta love the stock market. Companies that miss estimates and lower forecasts go up and companies (MLM, URI and many others) beat estimates and raise guidance and their stocks get creamed. No one says the market makes any sense, but stock movements after earnings are a coin flip.We'll see what happens when VMC reports on 7/31. They should be optimistic like MLM."
probably a half dozen mentions on CNBC today....talk about an echo chamber of chasers and or shills
Did anyone catch Cramer's interview with CEO Ward Nye tonight???Is there ANYONE HERE on this MESSAGE BOARD???
n Sept Barron's wrote a very bullish article about the rock and cement stocks..Summit was over $19.00 and today it's near $14.00. If Barron's is correct these stocks CX/MLM/VCM and SUM are all buys..In my opinion......
Well I am loaded up on MLM. I think it will run up into the next quarter.
"Getting in with her just last week, i'm winning already so awesome"
"Extremely Point by Point Video Well I will also say this here, Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" just has the current markets is down. Holding is great, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyze the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Mrs Mellisa_scott services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Mellisa_scott , she is always one step ahead of other traders, she fully monitored all my trades to avoid making me mistakes and losing my funds. My earnings has increased from 2 BTC to 19 BTC in just 11 weeks and some days. I have full confidence in her trading abilities, Mrs mellisa_scott can be reached the On Telegram (@ Mellisa_scott) be guided."

Great quarter. MLM continues to deposit money into my retirement account. The naysayers on this stock are in over their heads. Infrastructure is going to be a major target of the Biden administration and that only means higher prices for MLM.
What happened? Stock down $54.00 in after hours trade. No news on yahoo.

It's funny to me that Marvin immediately erased his last post. I'm surprised that he even caught the 2% drop an the media by back. Just further demonstrates he has no idea what hes talking about. Just move on my friend your wasting time here.
