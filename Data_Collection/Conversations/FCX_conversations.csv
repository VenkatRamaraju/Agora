"I’ve been busy buying and selling FCX and a nice profit today, And drinks on me for the squad FCX￼"
"And once again, the @Ultra indicator is spot on! If you see this board filled up with Ultra Rants then it is time to buy buy buy ... FCX pops nearly every time the following day."
I feel like we should have at least been in th 40s today.... Just shocked with copper being high
"Well...I woke fully expecting to find copper being hammered, and yes there was another spike, one I suspect is from EMEA markets coming on line, but this one is a spike UP. Copper now at $4.3395. There's no direct reason for this, just as there's been little reason for the spikes down, but it seems the market doesn't need a reason to churn the sh1t out of everything (excuse my ""french"" it's early my time). Which is what is happening. It must be befuddling if you're attitude is similar to Ultra's, or see everything strictly from the bearish perspective. Lord knows it been equally so for the bullish perspective, too. In any case.....play along? FCX early PM at $35. I won't chase here, but in anticipation of the usual up/down churn has set overshoot traps accordingly. So let the games begin!! G/L!"
Oh...but before I call it a day.....ohhhhhh RANDALL! Come over here and get your star stapled to that forehead there buddy! You deserve it for the outstanding call from the overnight. Sooooo.....without meaning to express violence...come here and get that star fixed to......
FCX barely can hold $36 per share.FCX down nearly -20% since May peaks.It was smart of me to allow assignment at $40...........Wasn't it Marcus.........?
"When the stock was 31, i bought 200 June 30 calls and paid an average of less than 5 for these. Kind of fun to sell off half the position today at 9.8"
"Interesting close. Copper ended the session north of $4.60 so everybody fess up....will you have trouble sleeping tonight in expectations to waking up and finding that copper has.....?? Yeah...me neither. These days I have no trouble sleeping. It's a blessing, I know.  Anyway...looks like the mischief is still continuing a bit....I see in AH's the bid now at .30...again. Just can't stay away from that fib line? Heh! Now on to tomorrw!"
Both this stock and copper will make runs at new highs in the next few weeks. Get onboard now! Don’t miss it. Mute Putz and make money with me! Easy money.
"WRAPUP 3-China's bond markets slump again as new Evergrande deadline passesReutersBy Andrew Galbraith and Marc Jones 7 hrs agoOct 11, 2021Excerpts:* Evergrande looks set to miss third round of bond payments* Some offshore bondholders have not had payment - sources* Modern Land asks investors to push back bond payment* Sinic warns it is likely to default next weekSHANGHAI/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chinese property firms' bonds were hit with another wrecking ball on Monday as Evergrande looked set to miss its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and rivals Modern Land and Sinic became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.""The key for offshore holders is the next couple of weeks and whether any payment or communication will come from the company in relation to its first missed offshore coupon,"" wrote Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst, UK & EMEA, at forex trading firm OANDA.Erlam wrote that it was ""highly unlikely"" Evergrande would make the payment ""considering how the last two deadlines have gone.""The cash-strapped property developer's troubles and contagion worries have sent shockwaves across global markets and the firm has already missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.""It's a disastrous day,"" said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, highlighting how even some supposedly safer ""investment grade"" firms had now seen 20% wiped off their bonds.""We think it's driven by global fund outflow .... Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers' cash flow hard,"" he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes.Analysts at JPMorgan also highlighted how international investors were now demanding the highest ever premium to buy or hold 'junk'-rated Chinese debt.There is now a whopping 1,200 basis point difference between the bank's closely-followed JACI China high yield index and a similar index of investment grade AA-rated local Chinese market bonds, known as ""onshore"" bonds.========================================================================================Evergrande is dragging the whole Chinese property development sector down, and along with it will come tumbling demand for steel and copper.Tomorrow we find out how bad Chinese September imports for copper metal were from the biggest country user of copper on the planet. Last year September (2020), they imported 722k mt.It might not even be half of that this year.Tomorrow."
40 next week!?
"Ever get the impression that where the action in these equities is concerned that somewhere there's a conversation going on....""Okay now....did you get all your places properly set? Table Ready? Okay then....Let'er RIP! "" Bid now $35.42. I'm not inferring this is what actually happens. Juuust sayin' is all..."
"Copper going from strength to strength. Now $4.7425. We're in rarified atmosphere boys and girls. It's been some time since the doctor has been up here. So enjoy it, but don't let it go to your head. You have to consider, in the midst of the cheer, what this portends for average monthly costs of living for most everyone. Yeah you know where I'm going with this...between the debt beast the country has shackled to its back we now have inflation rearing up and getting ready to eat (our disposable income) lunch....I can't help but think this is a case of being careful what you wish for? But what the hell...Bid $38.30."
"Copper screaming up to $4.40. Dare I say $4.50 in the cards in the near term (inside the week)?As for FCX, 40+ after earnings."
"FCX starting to move up look for 38 Tomorrow. Soon FCX gets some love BofA, G/S and others. M/S Credit Dog.S. Are just Haters. Upgrades will be here soon who won't love FCX with 6 Billion free cash for 2021 9 Billion 2022 FCX Will blow past 40 by end of month. If BofA is correct 50 by end of year. I'm Exicited for all that stayed the course helded and Bought on dips lets make the big money in next 6 months. Chooo Chooooooooo The train is electrified and used a lot of Copper. Lol"
"In watching and playing components of the market anybody else coming around to the sense that the pattern beginning to manifest is one where all pop's are sold, whereas during the very long, and very old, bull run we've experienced it's been buy all the dips? Witness the action right now.....The Dow went down a bit, then popped, now back red and sagging into the PM (which is when the pops get sold)....Even if I'm just projecting onto the market something that's wrong I still don't have a warm-n-fuzzy for the longer term prospects of the buy side game. The Bull is getting rather old and...senile? More and more the table seems to be tilting in favor of the sell side overall. But what do I know? I'm just flying by the seat of my pants here. Let's see what the market does. G/L! Bid $34.72. Copper at $4.3290."
"The administration announces an aggressive wind farm initiative just a few weeks after Germany acknowledges major failure due to lack of wind, policy mistakes and growing public resistance. Now that's sticking to the plan, no matter what."
"A little OT diatribe while watching the bid ping-pong from ~.60 to ~.70. About that debt limit. Fairy godmother the Janet came out yesterday (again) threatening doom to the world if the debt limit wasn't raised. Let's think about that for a second. What she was saying to the global community, all those holding our bonds/treasuries, is ""You won't get paid if we can't get the debt limit raised.""In effect she was saying that without new buyers to pay off the the existing holders everything collapses. Excuse me but......isn't that kind'a sort'a what 'ol Bernie of the Madoff clan was saying back in the day?So what the Janet (and Jerome) is acknowledging is the Fed, with complicit support of Treasury, is running a Ponzi scheme of epic size!Think this is all gonna end well?"
Bananas for all the FCX crowd.Enjoy them while they last.......because it won't.
"CU not fooling around. Randall you thinking, 36 more likely than 35. Miners buzzing along. My guess watchin is be going down however brief or prolonged like the last several days pop poof, but who knows, one little twitch from cu and poof. this nicely got up to 7% a few days ago then came back quick. div xdate is here . This wks 36 calls some consistent vol. Let's see"
Anyone else worried that the Fed is about to pull the rug out with a surprise rate hike?

Inventories available on the London Metal Exchange hit the lowest since 1974.
"Randall, yesterday late in date posted the following:""Look for a nice upside tomorrow, North of 38"" Nice call. Bid now $38.10. Might be worthy of the star call for the day. Let's see how it plays out but....don't forget the requirement for that star....."
Mr. putz has lately focused on Chinese developer default and what happens..the Chinese market has exploded on the upside. copper instead of falling below $4 is still in the $4.3 range which is basically the average price that fcx got last quarter. This Putz has really become the number 1 contra indicator..I can't wait what else Mr. putz has to say so I can act accordingly ...pls feel free to comment on anything in the market Mr. putz. Thank you in advance. Do you like oil and energy at these levels Mr. putz..Eagerly awaiting your comments 
Bid $36.09. Okay...someone calm Randall down...

"METALS-Perky stock markets lift copper pricesReutersBy Peter HobsonOCT 7, 2021 7:30AM EDTExcerpts:LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Copper prices rose on Thursday, helped by a recovery on global equities markets, falling exchange inventories and the threat of supply disruption at a mine in Peru.Prices have, however, fallen from a record high of $10,747.50 in May as global economic growth faltered. Copper is likely to fall further before rising demand reignites its rally, said independent analyst Robin Bhar.""If you're looking to trade copper until the end of the year, you're probably on the short side.

Odds are they're being paid, and mucho, by these spammers for being able to do this. There are so many of 'em that this much be the case. Kind'a sort'a like commercials on over the air TV/radio. So by clicking that ""report abuse"" button you just make it easier for them to pivot back to that community with metrics saying ""Look'it HOW MANY people are actually seeing your spam!?"" They pivot in that fashion.In effect your actions make the whole venture an advertiser and spamsters gold mine don't'cha know?

Apology -- This morning I posted an article about strong Chinese copper imports in September.The article was a year old. I apologize to anyone who read it.
Can you say 36 Today.
Elon stated at recent conference that US will need twice as much electricity to support EV expansion by 2030. Its in Barron’s article
"It doesn’t seem that we'll get the US infrastructure spending anytime soon. Democrat Progressives, with the support of President B, will look to combine it with the much larger social spending bill, infuriating moderate House Democrats who were promised a vote on the $1.3 trillion, Senate-approved, infrastructure bill by September 27. It appears that Nancy lied.It’s interesting that the President weighed in against the moderate Democrats, who supported him in the primary, and backed progressives who fully supported Mr. Sanders.Approval of the infrastructure bill will provide jobs, will help basic material stocks, and should be positive for markets in general. The direct impact on copper prices may not be significant. The drama continues this week."
Just listened to the Jeffries call with RA. Nothing new on the call and Chris played up the FcX case extremely well. RA did as well - but his extremely loquacious answers to each question was quite painful. They will look for a new CFO and that paints the succession plan with more certainty! RA met with Castillo the new Peruvian President and some of those meetings are good for him to do - gets respect from his experience! Also mentioned meeting with the CEO of Caterpillar for EV trucks for mining - huge demand for copper on that front! IMO - Market is jittery and is looking for any excuse to correct - but FcX case is extremely strong in the medium and long term!
"I've been doing some modeling on China demand with a significant construction impact - and based on the export demand I can't find a reasonable scenario where demand shrinks. Construction only accounts for 22%. The other categories all have some form of export component that goes along with the typical population growth requirements. That construction number accounts for all construction including commercial, government, etc. If housing construction took a massive dump, that would still only impact that line a negative 25 points. I don't believe that is the scenario at hand but let's just assume that's right. All of the other copper demand categories will grow at minimum 5-10% ... probably double that, but let's just assume it's that range ... remember those categories all have strong China domestic and export demand. In every scenario I run, copper demand should grow 2-5% minimum in China. Bottom line, China may have 'slowed' down, but is still going to outpace any new supply that may come on the market in the short term, notwithstanding any turn down in residential construction. I think people are beginning to understand that modeling more and more."
"No bananas for the FCX ch*mps today.....Maybe tomorrow will bring you a bright green one.Green ones taste better than the yellow ones, anyway."
"Been a while since I’ve seen such a coiled spring potential in a stock. Copper $4.29 vs $3.30 that Putz claimed (short squeeze). Stock technically is about to crack above its head and shoulder break to the downside which will be like rocket fuel. Copper is breaking back out to the upside. Economy and Covid recovering nicely but not too quickly so the Fed feels the need... (Goldilocks). Grasberg, US NoLs and many other factors are driving thousand of percentage growth in EBITDA and Cash Flow in FCX. forward PE is 7. So tell me again why you would ever short this?! Putz is caught with a short at $31 but we established that he’s just a bad investor. Anyone else want to jump of the same bridge?"
Mr Putz..with all your postings on reduce purchases by China and how much their share of the copper market in is.. have you ever stopped to wonder if they made such huge purchases last year then why was the price depressed last year compared to this year? If there is so much supply of copper then why do they have to auction and still getting prices with only a 1.5% discount? And your recent rants about the China default are not even affecting construction activity as it's still growing in China. Do you really think the Chinese will crash their economy lol ...hope to see you be more bearish at the low $30s for fcx so we longs can scoop up more easy money there he he.what a Putz!
"Last week, I said 36-37 by Friday; 38-39 next week prior to earnings; 40+ post earnings.I stand by that. Oh, and if Cu does go to $5+ next year, my $57.40 target remains. I write this as I charge my e-Tron at a fast charger; a Bolt waiting their turn. This charger now used around 12-14 hours per day consistently. I now see as many Tesla’s as Jeep’s. The world is changing. I love not paying $3.60-80/ gallon."

"Copper now at $4.0788. FCX bid isn't quite reflecting this dive at $33.10, but it's all over the map right now. It's acting like a high flying high-beta tech play. If you blink the bid moves +10 pennies right now. I guess the market forces in FCX are having a hard time accepting copper at current value? Or something.....anyway...it's hard to play it right now unless you're obsessively focused on the tick to tick. It's better to just sit it out and let it calm the frack down...."
"It is amazing to me that, while we fret about burning oil and gas, coal futures have surged to a record high of $210 per metric ton, coming from $83 at the end of April. While dealing with electricity shortages, China has returned to burning coal... but is vowing to achieve emissions standards and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. That's a good target date because everyone involved will be dead."

"I look away, see what pseudonym Market stated about copper and then took a look...sure enough...copper now at $4.5130 after ranging upwards of $4.5250. I'm not sure what's driving this, but what I'm finding curious is FCX bid is being firmly held under the 61.8% Fib retracement line sitting at ~$35.76.. It's tried FOUR TIMES to get north of it and each time been knee-capped on any further upside movement. Each time. So for me from a trading, and even investing...that's the line to watch. Bid now .64 and there's not much use in doing anything until you see how that line gets played out....just some thoughts worth about that much. G/L!"
"Copper analysts reset outlook on China's dual demand r[ed]uctionsReutersBy Mai NguyenOCT 7, 2021 4:36AM EDTExcerpts:Oct 7 (Reuters) - Copper analysts are reviewing their price forecasts for the red metal after simultaneous disruptions in two key sectors in China that together make up more than half the country's copper demand.China is the world's biggest user of copper, accounting for around 50% of global consumption, so a shake-up to its copper market balance has global repercussions.""Bearish short-term, bullish long-term is definitely a good way to sum it up. The longer-term demand dynamics are great. But short-term cyclical demand is clearly a worry,"" said Colin Hamilton, managing director at BMO Capital Markets.Benchmark LME three-month copper prices CMCU3 have been largely locked in a narrow $9,000-$10,000 per tonne trading range for the past four months, but Hamilton sees them dropping by around $1,000 a tonne from now, or by more than 10%, due to weaker near-term use in China.""I'd probably be more in the $8,000 camp than $9,000,"" he said.DOUBLE WHAMMY:Once China's top-selling developer, China Evergrande Group 3333.HK is facing one of the country's largest-ever debt restructurings with more than $300 billion in liabilities.The possible collapse of such a high profile builder and borrower has raised fears of contagion to the rest of China's vast property sector, a massive copper consumer that could be hobbled by any enduring credit crunch.At the same time, prolonged power curbs in China have raised uncertainty over how constrained manufacturing will become, and for how long, after factory activity unexpectedly fell in September.Machinery, air conditioning, fridges and other consumer durables combined account for 42% of China's end-use of copper and construction takes up 22%, CRU data shows, while power accounts for 22% and transport 8%.""Weakening construction, credit tightening, Evergrande crisis and a power shortage in China are key headwinds for copper prices,"" said ANZ analyst Soni Kumari.Analysts at Citi recently cut their price forecasts for copper to $8,200 a tonne for the next three months from $8,800 previously, and to $8,600 for the first quarter of 2022 from $9,000.BUY THE DIP?While most analysts agree on the softer near-term demand outlook, some are still waiting for evidence of consumption cuts before adjusting forecasts.""To corroborate the idea of demand destruction in copper (by the power curb), we will have to wait for more data and evidence after the market returns from holidays,"" said ING analyst Wenyu Yao, referring to China's Oct. 1-7 Golden Week break.China's tight copper inventories are also providing an offset to the broader macro picture, limiting market pessimism.========================================================================================Too many are looking for excuses to pitch to support short-term copper prices.The short-term outlook for copper is pretty simple: China.The long-term outlook for copper is also pretty simple: China.Since China uses over 36,000 metric tonnes of copper PER DAY.......... low SHFE inventory is inconsequential and meaningless. The copper pimps always fail to discuss copper warehouse stocks at Shanghai's new energy exchange (over 70k mt.) as well. Chinese industrial users don't get their copper from the future's markets warehouses anyway.Some Indians block a road in Peru whining for social justice from Glencore...........inconsequential.All that matters FOR COPPER is China.CHINA, CHINA, CHINA."

FCX should close above 38.80 I think so will see in 27 Minutes. Thoughts ?
"From the CEO Richard Adkerson...the article is over at Seeking Alpha. So, looking back on my career in the mid-90s, we designed the long-term plan for the open pit at Grasberg mid-90s. And then we started investing 15-years or more in the underground. And we completed -- just note that Freeport has been doing substantial block cave mining at Grasberg in addition to the open pit since early 1980s.We also have a large block cave molybdenum mine here in the United States. So we are really experienced with it. But it was a major undertaking, I mean, really major undertaking key for our company and its future. We completed mining the open pit right at the end of 2019, went out there for the final part of it.So now that physical progress we've reported on it quarterly. We set out our -- we give a lot of details about what we're attempting to do. And, man, it's going, but it’s going incredibly well. As we speak today, at the end of last quarter, we were up to like 80% of our targeted. Mine rates will be at 100%, close to it now, but by the end of the year. The risk associated with the development of the underground mine is now behind us.We have the infrastructure in place, the equipment. We added a new crusher recently to the Grasberg block cave mine, which gives us a lot more flexibility there. We're doing a middle expansion. That work is now underway. It will be our third sag mill by 2023. That'll be up and running which will allow us to process the volume of ore that we have. Our teams are meeting the targets, the number makes it look easy, but it's not. There's always issues that come up in a project of this scale, and our team meets those and is cared for with them.So I'm really proud of them. And for me, my first visit to Grasberg was 1988. And I saw that the second drill hole was being put in the ore body. So I've watched this whole thing develop, knowing this conversion to underground was coming and now to see it. And for it to be successful is really gratifying. And hats off to our technical team, who's planned it, executed it and our PT-FI team is doing so well."
"OT. While this board muses the microcosm and minutiae of copper supply and demand, I'd like to make a prediction on the market as a whole. I expect this Holiday season to be huge. Demand for goods will blow through the roof. Food inflation and shortages, will be a big topic and potential headwind, but families are gonna get together after maybe 2 years not spending holidays together? Travel will be up big. Energy demand up big. Bond yields and Gold/Commodities will rise in tandem, and maybe US Dollar too depending on the Global outlook."
Seems $35 is the (main resistance) line for now don't it? Copper meanwhile is doing a jagged dance from ~$4.39 to ~$4.41....it just shot from that lower end to the upper end for something like the third time in under an hour...and now at $4.4120. Both of 'em....copper and FCX...are acting like....

"Reading recent “Top Reaction"" posts, I’ve learned that- Chinese copper imports through September are down significantly (Ultra).- Copper inventories at SFE and LME registered warehouses are at very low levels (Joe).- The Chinese government is holding its 4th auction of copper inventory this week, selling its diminished reserves to Chinese manufacturers (High).China seems close to being “out” of copper. If one believes that Covid is getting under control and that global economies are set to rebound, this seems inevitably bullish for future copper prices and demand. Timing is the only question.The popularity among investors of any company advancing the “electrification of the world"" initiative is a strong headwind for copper prices and FCX stock. Admittedly, based on recent events in Europe and Asia, the green initiative seems like a con… with over 40% of the world's electricity being generated from burning coal. I do think, however, that the green proponents will not be discouraged and the market will continue to reward managements who say the right things.

"Kamoa-Kakula’s Phase 2 Expansion, Doubling Production to over 400,000 Tonnes of Copper per Year, Ahead of Schedule and Now on Track to Begin Full Operations in Q2 2022Investing News Network - October 12th, 2021Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN) (OTCQX: IVPAF) Co-Chairs Robert Friedland and Yufeng “Miles” Sun announced that construction of Kamoa-Kakula’s Phase 2 concentrator plant, which is designed to double copper production to approximately 400,000 tonnes a year, is proceeding ahead of schedule. The project team now anticipates beginning operations of the Phase 2 concentrator plant in Q2 2022, as compared to current guidance of Q3 2022.Mark Farren, Kamoa Copper’s CEO, stated: “Construction of the Phase 2 concentrator plant is progressing very well and the project team is working hard to complete the project ahead of schedule, similar to what we did with the Phase 1 plant. Based on the pace of the work completed to date, we now expect to deliver first ore to the Phase 2 ball mills before the end of Q2 2022.”The Phase 2, 3.8 million-tonne-per-annum (Mtpa) concentrator plant is a carbon copy of the Phase 1 concentrator plant, and is being constructed alongside the Phase 1 plant. All long-lead items of equipment, structural steel, platework and mechanical equipment for the Phase 2 plant already are delivered to site or are en-route. As of the end of September 2021, the Phase 2 plant was more than 50% complete.========================================================================================Lotsa copper coming to market in short order. Kamoa-Kakula Phase 2 construction schedule advanced to next summer.Like Lego blocks.Phase 3 will be just like Phases 1 and 2, and will be commissioned by 2024.By 2028, this will be the world's second largest copper mine by output, outpacing Grasberg by 2027.Who says nobody is building copper mines...........?"
Copper drops from ~$4.30 to ~$4.2680 so you know what FCX did. It's gone from ~$33.50 to ~$32.95. In about 10 minutes time. And still crashing since that's what I'd expect once it broke back south of the 100% fib line. Bid now $32.82. I'm riding a short having closed the earlier buy...and bid now .75....not sure what caused this but it is what it is. G/L!
"Mining Stocks Offer a Cheap Play on Growth. Dig In.Barron’s 9/17/21 Big diversified mining companies BHP Group , Rio Tinto , Anglo American , Glencore , and Vale are in the best shape ever.Their shares, however, trade cheaply amid worries that the good times in industrial commodities are ending. For investors willing to accept some risk, the Big Five miners offer a rich opportunity.The five have price/earnings ratios in the single digits—some of the lowest of any major industry group in the global stock markets. And their dividends are generally ample. Rio Tinto’s trailing 12-month yield is 14%.“All of the stocks are attractively valued,” says Chris LaFemina, a Jefferies analyst. “Balance sheets are especially strong, and free cash flow is high. A lot of the damage to the stocks from lower iron-ore prices is already priced in. If China stops slowing, these stocks are very underpriced.”A sustained economic slowdown in China is the big fear. The country accounts for about half of all worldwide demand for commodities like iron ore and copper. Prices for iron ore—the biggest profit contributor at BHP (ticker: BHP, BBL), Rio Tinto (RIO), and Vale (VALE)—have fallen 50% from spring highs, to about $120 a metric ton. This past week, their descent continued, falling 7.5% after China reported a 13% drop in August steel production. As a result, mining stocks have declined. BHP is 30% below its May high.“The market is trading this on the next China data point, whereas the long-term valuation argument is pretty compelling,” LaFemina says.Even with the slump in iron ore, the producers remain highly profitable. BHP and Rio Tinto’s estimated all-in costs, including transportation to China, are about $35 a ton.Other commodities are in better shape. Copper, at $4.30 a pound, is down 10% from its spring peak, but up 20% this year. Aluminum is up 40% in 2021, while thermal coal prices have doubled.The mining industry has been playing up its green credentials as it seeks to appeal to socially responsible investors. “Metals and mining are critical to the decarbonization of the world,” says Charl Malan, senior analyst for natural resources equity strategy at VanEck. “It goes beyond minerals like lithium and cobalt that people are talking about, and includes aluminum, copper, and the platinum group metals.”Companies are cutting the carbon footprint of their mining operations. BHP is getting out of the oil-and-gas business, while Anglo American (NGLOY) is divesting its thermal-coal business. One problem is that the production of steel from iron ore is very carbon-intensive.LaFemina argues that Anglo American and Glencore (GLNCY) are decarbonization plays because of their production of metals that are critical to renewable power and electric vehicles. Glencore is the top global producer of cobalt, a vital battery metal.Unlike major energy companies, the large miners generally have little or no net debt. Rio Tinto had $3.1 billion of net cash on June 30, versus about $57 billion of net debt for Exxon Mobil (XOM), for example.The combination of strong balance sheets and limited capital spending has led to rising dividends, particularly for BHP, Rio Tinto, and Vale. LaFemina calls those three companies high-yield bond proxies. Trailing 12-month yields for BHP and Vale are both about 10%.All are showing restraint on capital spending. VanEck’s Malan notes that total capital spending at the Big Five miners, plus Teck Resources (TECK), should total about $35 billion this year, down from $80 billion a decade ago.“Talk to the miners and they will say they are mining for profitability and not trying to get big,” he says.The dividend policies of the international miners are unfamiliar to many U.S. investors. Most pay semiannual dividends that fluctuate with profits. Rio Tinto, for instance, targets dividends at 40% to 60% of earnings, but it also issued a large special dividend in the first half of 2021, for a total payout ratio of 75%. U.S. companies typically pay fixed dividends each quarter. Investors need to accept dividend variability, but overall dividends should be generous, barring a collapse in commodity prices. The rest of the article is about the big 5. FCX is not mentioned. The article is too long for YF which, early this morning, would not accept it in pieces."

"china made a series of energy mistakes and they are suffering the consequences....they burn coal for more then 50%of their energy.they face severe pollution,drought in the south and flooding in the north.china instituted a self imposed moratorium on the use of coal,reduced production and cut aussi imports to combat the adverse effects of burning coal...........they have not yet developed enough clean electrical energy sources to cover the loss of coal............they also have depleted scrap copper and stratigic copper reserves during their misguided attempt to dump copper on the world market to lower copper prices........now china must ration energy unless they burn more coal (lift self imposed restrictions) or rapidly develope clean alternative electrical energy.......china will choose the latter and they will require massive amounts of copper"
"Energy crisis should force Europe and China to rethink green agendasNikkei AsiaVandana HariOctober 8, 2021 05:00 JSTExcerpts:The last thing the world economy needed as it struggled to regain momentum after the COVID delta variant wave was a widespread energy crisis fanning the flames of inflation, dealing a blow to manufacturers already hamstrung by supply chain snarls, and jeopardizing the ability of central banks to sustain monetary stimulus.COVID-induced disruptions and free-market forces have played a part, no doubt. But shortsighted, ham-handed government policies to decarbonize the energy sector are also to blame, and the sooner countries realize this, the better their chances of averting more such disasters.Some see poetic justice in major European economies desperately lapping up supplies of natural gas and coal at any cost after eschewing their production and withdrawing financing to focus squarely on greener alternatives, such as renewables for power generation, even though they are not very scalable or reliable.Others see the irony in this situation coming to pass just ahead of next month's 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, where countries are expected to double down on pledges to forsake traditional fuels faster than before to meet net-zero emission targets.Another set of industry stakeholders and activists have renewed calls for hastening the move away from fossil fuels, puzzlingly implying that it will somehow avert a recurrence of future energy shortage upheavals.In short, the situation has generated a lot of noise and confusion, especially for the average person in the street, who has been sold the utopian dream of being able to enjoy clean air and blue skies without giving up on any of the modern-day comforts made possible by a reliable and growing supply of electricity and other sources of fossil fuel-reliant energy.This costly, debilitating energy crisis should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers. They can neither afford confusion nor naivete over the perils of racing through an energy transition that jeopardizes the security of supply.A steady, reliable and affordable supply of coal, gas, oil, electricity and all available forms of energy is nonnegotiable to protect the world's fragile post-COVID economic recovery, especially as it is already being threatened by the specter of stagflation -- high inflation accompanied by slow economic growth -- and the erosion of consumers' purchasing power.========================================================================================More and more of the world's citizens are quickly learning that 'INSTANT GREEN WAVE' is just 'one big fraud'.............that is FAILING.Kinda like the Tang of real, meaningful energy policy.Fugazi.........to you New Yorkers.Fugazi."

"FcX MessagingLots of POVs on this board about the lack of good PR messaging from FcX management. Partly true, but there has been a swathe of good messaging in the recent past - but the question is who is the audience. Here are the key points I hear:- FcX has completed its main goals of Grasberg and Lone Star- Lots of brownfield opportunities for growth and long lived assets- CaPex is done and will remain low for the next few years and not huge for the brownfield opps of the future- NOLs in the US for many years keeps low tax rate for - Massive inventory of leach piles to recover within the US- Cash flows will be returned to SHs soonWhy has the market yawned at this for the past few months even with high copper prices. These points have not translated into a management plan that shows growth beyond 2022 and does not address the Grasberg ownership transition in 2023 and the hit to earnings. In reality they have barely met projections in the past 2 Qs and in the most recent mining conference calls they all but set expectations of another ‘meh’ Q3 performance. Grasberg was impacted by Covid in July and August and Latin America is kinda slow!The market rewards stocks when they hear growth and buybacks/dividends - FcX management has all but assured that this will occur most likely in March 2022 (or Maybe Jan 22) post the EOY results. RA’s comments on when he will transition the CEO role - when he sees ‘this’ through and enjoy the success of what he helped build - not just the Grasberg completion. So its either 2025 when Lone Star looks like being set up to be another Morenci or something is brewing in the near term!Vanguard that had been the biggest shareholder of FcX at 152M shares has shed about a third of its holdings in the past 3Qs - down to about 104M… Hedge funds, JP Morgan and Fidelity have picked it up - but at least one institutional shareholder appears peeved! the good news in 76 hedge funds have bought into FcX and that is a record that keeps on moving up... they tend to have a short term attention span!Two triggers that could propel the stock price before EOY…- Infrastructure bills get passed in Congress (looking better by the day - Manchin and Simena will sell out soon enough)- Someone offers a deal for FcXAbsent these triggers - I am in the camp that the market will trade in the weekly/monthly options markets and keep FcX in the 30’s…. Long term - this is a great place to be, but lets see if the movement can happen sooner!"
Where is Waldo?..I mean ultra
great volume today.
The bid is absolutely nailed to that 38.2% fib retracement line in the low .40's right now...market forces are categorically not letting the bid back north of it...I suspect that's about it for the day....it'll probably p/b into close. Or maybe I'm just saying that because I'm now short from .45 just playing off that logic. Bid now .35....

Staggering and note the severe backwardation. I don't think I have seen this magnitude even with oil when it has gone nuts.I am an investor, an option trader mostly for income. Not a commodity player, but damn sell futures on cu now and buy out a couple weeks and if this rally holds big time profit opportunity."

Everyone on this site is putting too much thought into trying to predict where FCX SP and copper price is headed- bulls and bears. It’s actually quite simple. Inflation is running rampant! There will be far worse pain at the pump as fuel prices continue to rise. I would quit trying to analyze- you guys are hurting your brains. FCX is gonna make a bull run soon. It has no choice thanks to our fiscally irresponsible government

"OT: In watching the Blue Origins capsule be set up to be opened here's what I think....if Shatner comes out doing a ""Live Long and Prosper"" plus any sort of Vulcan hand solute the digital universe is going to lose their minds....."
"Just to trigger some dialog on FcX’s expected 3Q results. In the Q2 earnings release, they projected sales of 1035 b lbs Cu, 360 K oz of Au and 22 M lbs of Moly. In H1 21 sales were lower than production by 69 M lbs of Cu and 39 K oz of gold - building up inventory.In the 2 mining conference calls since the Q2 call, management has cautioned that Covid impacted July and Aug at Grasberg - but did not mention impact on production. Copper and gold prices will likely be weaker in Q3 by 15c/lb and 50$/oz.If FcX reports weaker production AND sales AND higher costs - the stock price tanks or stagnates at best. It is likely that they meet sales targets to be on track to hit their annual projections, but one never knows with this team.The key metrics I will focus on in OCF and net debt. They hit 2.4B OCF in Q2 and have low balled 4B OCF for the second half even with higher sales. This low ball estimate will result in CF of 2B after the higher CaPex estimate of 1.4B and non-controlling interest payments of 600M. At a minimum, this would allow for ~1B to be returned to SH. kQ’s comment at the Morgan Stanley conference was that one could estimate what this amount would be and that the board would decide how to pay it back after the year end results - the only clear statement on timing and emphasis that this was coming. Hopefully OCF will be higher and the payout target could be larger.Now that Golden Week is over in China, hopefully Cu prices get back to normalcy and higher! As an aside, all the miners incl RIO, BHP, VALE SPs have been hit even though Iron Ore, Zinc, and Nickel prices are much higher… and a rotation out of value seems to be A OK even as these companies and FcX are printing cash! Hope this changes!"
"For what it's worth, FCX made the Oct 4 Barron’s list of 10 quality S&P 500 stocks that tumbled more than 10% in September and had a debt-to-assets ratio lower than 30%, next 12-month earnings growth estimates above 10%, and return-on-equity ratio higher than 20%."
 FCX up over 21% year to date. Money managers selling to lock in those profits.

"Is it me or is this thing trading, acting, very odd today? Bid has gone from ~$33 to $33.31 while copper can't get out of its own way at (coming off its lows) $4.0877. Looks like the market really doesn't want to entertain the bid (in FCX) staying south of $33 for any length of time. Given this...is that a tell? Bid now $33.36."
"Teck Resources (TECK +0.9%) edges higher while Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.2%) tilts lower, as Bank of America reinstates coverage of both with Buy ratings and respective $36 and $39 price targets."

"China’s Growth Forecasts Downgraded as Power Crunch WorsensBloombergSeptember 26, 2021, 10:04 PM EDTExcerpts:Economists at Nomura Holdings Ltd. and China International Capital Corp. cut their growth forecasts for China’s economy as electricity shortages force businesses to cut back on production.The power cuts will likely slash the country’s growth rate by 0.1 to 0.15 percentage point in the third and fourth quarters, CICC economists said in a report. The power supply shock will have a large impact on short-term production, especially in September, with industrial output growth in the month likely dropping to 4%-4.5%, they wrote.The stringent measures to cut electricity use in economic powerhouses like Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces will probably cause the purchasing managers index, scheduled for release later this week, to drop below 50, Nomura said in a report Monday. Its economists had already cut their quarterly growth forecasts last Friday and lowered their full-year estimate to 7.7% from 8.2%, and now see a possibility of lowering the forecasts further due to the power shortages. “Even with these cuts, we see more downside risk to our forecasts,” Nomura’s Chief China Economist Lu Ting said in a note. “We expect markets to downwardly adjust their forecasts soon.”CICC also sees an impact on inflation, with producer prices likely to rise at least 9% in 2021 from a year earlier, weighing on the profitability of downstream firms. Monetary policy will likely stay neutral with an easing bias, CICC economists said.In a separate report, CICC upgraded their full-year 2021 projection for export growth to 25.7% from 18.4%, citing robust orders. About 30%-40% of orders are diverted from other exporter countries hit by the virus, it said.=======================================================================================Similar story: China is short electricity. Bad for economic growth, bad for copper consumption.Considering they consume +55% of the world's annual copper supply, I would say a slowdown in China will be VERY BAD for copper prices in the near term.A stink is on the wind, and it's blowing from China. As usual....."

"World’s top copper projects by capex — reportMININGEditor October 11, 2021 | 11:23 am Intelligence News Asia Canada Latin America Russia and Central Asia Copper Excerpts:Global copper mine production is set to expand by 7.8% y-o-y in 2021 as a result of multiple new projects coming online and low-base effects due to covid-19 lockdowns reducing output in 2020, market analyst Fitch Solutions finds in its latest industry report.Output over the next few years is slated to be strong, as a number of new projects and expansions come online, supported by rising copper prices and demand.Fitch forecasts global copper mine production to increase by an average annual rate of 3.8% over 2021-2030, with annual output rising from 20.2mnt in 2020 to 29.4mnt by the end of the decade.Chile is the world’s top copper producer, and leading project development are mainly large-scale miners BHP and Teck Resources, which have been attracted to the country’s well-developed infrastructure, extensive reserves and history of stability.Chile has attracted a substantial amount of mining investment in recent years, which will begin to pay off over the coming years as new projects are slated to come online, and the analyst’s 2021 growth forecast is primarily underpinned by the start-up of BHP’s Spence Growth Option project. First production was achieved in December 2020 and is projected to increase payable copper production by 185kt per annum once ramped up — the process is expected to take 12 months.========================================================================================There will be plenty of copper for all the propeller heads the world over.Fitch's estimate of 29.4mm mt by 2029 is reasonable since the current spate of projects already in construction (or just having completed it) will take world copper mine production to over 25mm mt by 2025. So the world industry kicking around for another 4mm from a host of already well-know projects undergoing permitting currently should make Fitch's Year 2030 estimate, reasonable.Major projects that are advancing pre-construction project phases and should be in production by 2030: Magistral - SCCO - PeruLos Chancas - SCCO - PeruMichiquillay - SCCO - PeruEl Galeno - China Minmetal - PeruZafranal - Teck/Mitsubishi - PeruQB3 - Teck/Sumitomo - ChileEscondida Mill No. 4 - BHP - ChileRadomiro Tomic Phase 2 - Codelco - ChileAndina Expansion - Codelco - ChileBagdad Mill No. 2 - FCX - ArizonaOyu Tolgoi Underground - ???, probably Rio Tinto - MongoliaHu'u - Vale/Indo JV (tbd) - IndonesiaThese are well know projects undergoing permitting, and/or already permitted by the country of origin. This bunch of mines gets world copper production close to what Fitch's projects by 2030 (about 9 mm mt new copper over next +9 years). No telling what enhanced leach technology will do to revitalize SX/EW mine output the world over, but the copper miners are all exploring brownfield capacity additions for advances in that space, and mill capacity additions at sulfide operations to ward off sharp drops in production from falling grades (namely in Chile). Escondida is the poster child for being far-sighted in this practice.Incremental copper demand out to 2030 from EV proliferation and continued renewable energy project builds won't add up to more than half of what Fitch's says comes online by 2030.The world will have more copper than it knows what to do with by 2030, I'm afraid.Better build more wind turbines, propeller heads."
"Relevant MS comments after Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference (Metals and Mining)Freeport: In harvesting mode. (1) The company remains on track to execute on its capital allocation plan (see here) and return 50% of excess cash flow to shareholders. The company has reached its net debt target and, with the continued ramp-up of Grasberg, it is well positioned to generate cash flows in excess of planned capex. (2) Investors seemed very interested in Freeport's future growth options. Although the company has brownfield opportunities on all regions it operates, planning and permitting are still multiyear processes (that don't respond to higher copper prices). At the moment, Bagdad in the US and Kucing Liar in Indonesia appear as the next likely projects, while a potential El Abra expansion in Peru remains in wait-and-see mode. That said, the company is investing to increase recoveries from existing production/stockpiles. (3) The ramp-up of the Indonesia underground mines continues to progress and FCX remains on track for 100% of the targeted output rate by year-end. This will support ~15% growth in copper volumes and ~20% in gold expected in 2022.What's new: According to press reports, The House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee proposed, as part of the $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending measure, imposing royalties and a reclamation fee on hard-rock mines on federal land. The legislation would impose a gross royalty of 8% on existing mines and 4% on new mines. The reclamation fee would be set at 7 cents per ton of rock moved.Impact to our views: The future of the proposed legislation is uncertain, as the full House could reverse the committee's move and it is unclear if the bill would hold up in Senate. That said, if passed, we believe the legislation would have no material impact on Freeport or MP Materials (the two mining names in our coverage with mines in the US), as their operations are not on federal land."

"OT but worth considering maybe? Default situations. Everyone is tracking Evergrande and that mess. But while they've been watching that one so closely they appear to have been blind-sided by the next domino falling. Fantasia Holding Group (don't'cha just luv the name?), a developer of luxury apartments in...China (of course, said it didn't make a $206M payment due Oct 4. They're in default. And so the 2008-esque mischief in China continues to grow and blossum. How long before it leaves their mainland? I guess we'll find out....now back to the game...FCX bid $34.24. So far it's holding its gains. Copper, too, at $4.2410."
"REPORT CARD ON FCX (SINCE MAY 2021).>Since May 7, 2021 - FCX share performance: -25% including dividends.>Since May 13, 2021 - MRO share performance: +37%, including dividends.Energy has proved to be a superior investment to copper. Beyond a doubt.Glad I made that switch, but might be time to let MRO go if it keeps climbing since MRO is starting to hit various price targets.Just like FCX once did, which is now on the wrong track (the one heading south)."
38 for earnings...time to visit the top o de range
"One million, two million, three million...making money is easy if you just ignore Putz. Sounds like HLS missed the boat. Expected copper down?! Why? Putz has been wrong for 18 months. Why did you think today was the day?!"
"Gold 1,758 Copper 4.19 up 15 cents FCX 32.82 what a day that should been 34.00 plus another real ugly day.. Dow up over 500 points huge rally."
Jobs Report out at 830 Don't think it will be great est 500k I think below 400k. Copper 4.24 Look for Copper to move back north of 4.30 next week. FCX close north of 35.00 Today. Over 40 by end of Oct 2021
"Simple economics. More money than ever has been lent out now including $31T to the US government. The banks want a higher interest rate for their money being lent. They are going to drive up all commodities to create inflation so the Fed has to raise interest rates and they make more on their loans. If you want to hear the musings of guy that spent too much time in a mine shaft, by all means, continue to be on the wrong side of the trade. If you want to be rich like the bankers and me, come join me. Buy in. Hold it for 12 months and bam, you’re rich."
B of A Copper setting up for all time high oil longs are moving to Copper for the long haul. Look for Copper price to move higher quickly oil to drop back under 70 dollars. If Bof A is correct on 5.00 Copper FCX will Fly past 50
I agree with Mr. Putz that traders manipulated the cu price today and it's not sustainable. They only did it to break the 6 month downtrend in both cu and fcx. It will be back to $30 soon enough but in the meantime can they keep manipulating it so that fcx hits $40 and beyond. I agree with putz that's $3.3 copper will arrive soon enough and all the putz postings about China developer default will crash copper but just a little more manipulation please. Thanks.
"Gold 1,770 Copper 4.36 Headed to 4.40 FCX 37.50 This Week. Hope you are lomg and loaded up."
Copper will do what it wants in the near term but someone is accumulating all shares at $32.50+. They know cash flows will be massive at this company in the next 18 months. Shareholder returns will follow. Will you follow millionaires like me and RA and KQ or will you decide to bet on a fired middle manager in the mining biz who has incorrectly called copper prices for the last 20Months? Hmmmm
"And now, copper just spiked...up....now at $4.1685. I've no idea if this will sustain, but I do know this, the market is sure having fun with this commodity and sector ain't it?"
"""Rio suspended sales of copper from its Kennecott smelter after the plant shut down last week following a release of molten metal. Stausholm said the company is still assessing the damage and has no timeline for when they’ll be able to restart sales."""
"Copper continuing to move back north, now at $4.2912 yet one more time. Yet while FCX bid started strong the sell side has stepped onto the court stronger. Bid now $34.23 (after getting all the way to $35.01)...let's see what sort of head-fake is setting up. G/L!"
"Evergrande creditors fear imminent default as concerns shake sectorReutersBy Anshuman Daga and Scott Murdoch, Clare JimOctober 8, 202112:00 PM EDTExcerpts:>Evergrande bondholders worried about lack of information>Evergrande bond trustee Citi hires Mayer Brown -source>Evergrande due to pay nearly $150 mln in coupons next weekSHANGHAI/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) offshore bondholders are concerned that it is close to defaulting on debt payments and want more information and transparency from the cash-strapped property developer, their advisers said.Evergrande, which could trigger one of China's largest defaults as it wrestles with debts of more than $300 billion and whose troubles have already sent shockwaves across global markets, missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.With Evergrande staying silent on dollar debt payments and prioritising onshore creditors, offshore investors have been left wondering if they will face large losses at the end of 30-day grace periods for last month's coupons. [nL8N2QP1H5]A group of bondholders have enlisted investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to advise them.""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday.""Unfortunately, so far, we have had a couple of calls with the advisers,"" but there had not been any ""meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information"", he saidEvergrande, which faces nearly $150 million in offshore payment obligations next week, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.The possible collapse of one of China's biggest borrowers has triggered worries about contagion risks in the world's second-largest economy, with other debt-laden property firms hit by rating downgrades on looming defaults.With few clues as to how local regulators propose to contain the contagion from Evergrande, the price of bonds and shares in Chinese property developers slumped again on Friday.""The potential lack of transparency and clarity are leaving investors more skittish and it will be very difficult for people to want to refinance any debt coming due in that particular sector,"" said Cliff Corso, chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management.========================================================================================Evergrande has not made good on the skipped payments due from September and the 30 day grace window is running out on that. Over $150mm in payments due in mid October, and they cannot even pay September's interest ? Evergrande will be in bankruptcy within a month, and the ensuing chill it will being to Chinese property development will crash the countries copper demand something fierce.Remember boys and girls, upwards of 25% of all the copper used in China (annually) is used in residential property development.That's more copper than all the copper used in the Eurozone (for everything, including their stupid offshore wind farms that don't produce any electricity......Lol).So it's substantial and even a 15% slowdown in the rate that China throws up residential tower developments will be a meaningful amount of copper (500k mt. on annual basis) that won't be consumed by that sector of their economy."
Get ready for certain snide rejoinders but.....guess what asset is being discussed? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zU15H1xrMw
"Copper at $4.1235. FCX PM bid $31.70. Gonna be a tough one today if all the shrieking and hair on fire running about being expressed by media is any indication. I will say this....that energy complex is....no pun intended....on fire. I heard something to the effect that in the UK gas prices went up 20%, in one day. With more ahead. Can you imagine? Putin, with his hand on the value controlling energy to the western parts of Europe, must be licking his mafiosa chops, eh? Gonna be an interesting winter me thinks. But for now....let's see how the rest of the week goes. G/L!"
"Copper will break to new highs, not on manipulation but on real supply demand challenges. While Putz has been posting fake news articles from Xi tribe, the market has been making a strong deficit."
Sell side went on the attack shortly after +$37 after the bell. Drove it down and hit a trap I'd placed just south of $36.60 so I'm in for a buy side trade. Copper at $4.61 so it's gonna be interesting. G/L!
Anyone think a closing bid of around $33 is in order? Where's that 100% fib retracement line again? 
"I am up $16,870.12 in ONE WEEK!!! Thank you Jesus!!! :-)"
"Bid keeps being sat on. Now at $34.28 again. Wonder if it's Options related? The $34/35 Calls expiring today are each showing a bit of volume at 1,494 and 1,756 respectively. Interestingly enough the Oct 15 $35 Calls are smokin' at 6,757, with the $36's at 1,408. Hmmmm....?"
Copper is on Fire.
Will FCX move past 35 Tomorrow ?
Fcx…the company has positioned itself to take full advantage of modern energy needs.
"Man, Putz has been so dead on with all of his analysis. The fact that he called this is just crazy intuition. To think 18 months ago he said we’d be at $3.30 by now and here we are. Oops. Never-mind. I was booting my machine from 2018 and it showed the price from back then. Nope, never-mind...Putz is still,...well a Putz. copper at $4.50 today. God I love making money!"
