Nothing holding copper up now.
Copper 4.13 Look Copper to move back up Chile Mines are on strike. Chile has Major water supply at Escondida to halt ground water pumping for 3 months Chile has a major Drought BHP said they will have cut production back at all Chile operations. Look For Copper to move back 4.20 Monday and higher as the week goes on. Sea water won't be ready to use until 2030. Good news for Copper and FCX.
"If its all about copper prices, why bother with FCX and just trade Cu via the commodities market?"
"CNBC now talking up ""Is our grid ready for EV's and such..?"" Talking up infrastructure rebuilding, etc.. That should be good for a penny of upside.  Bid $34.37."
"In early October there will be a confluence of events that will greatly enhance fcx stock price….Congress will pass and the president will sign a variation of the infrastructure and budget bills….fcx will declare a substantial special dividend … hopefully COVID delta will be suppressed , world economies will continue to improve , employment will pick up and consumer spending will be on the upswing for the Holliday season . By early October ,befor earnings,fcx stock may be in the 42 to45 range and significantly higher thereafter.good forward momentum."
"Gold 1,744 Copper now 4.26 and dropping but Will recover today. Market Red FCX Premarket 36.22 Look for FCX to close Green today will see."
"Commodity Prices Should Bounce Back. A Few Stocks to Play the Rebound.Barron’s, Andrew Barry Aug. 27, 2021 Commodity producers look appealing after a pullback from May highs. While prices for industrial metals like copper and iron ore have been weaker, Chris LaFemina, a mining analyst at Jefferies, is upbeat on the sector. “The soft patch will end,” he says. “There won’t be a massive acceleration in demand, but things will start to pick up, and there are supply constraints in commodities like copper that will result in demand growing faster than supply.”Among diversified miners, BHP (ticker: BHP), at $66, is down 20% from its peak; Rio Tinto (RIO) is off 19%, to $75; Anglo American (NGLOY) is off 13%, to $21; and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), a global copper producer, is down 21% from its peak to $36.LaFemina is most enamored of Freeport—and copper.Copper prices, down about 10% from their spring peak, to $4.33 a pound, have held up better than iron ore, which is off 40% from its high, to $145 a ton. BHP, Rio Tinto, and Anglo American have significant exposure to iron ore.LaFemina likes the copper story in part because of the rise of renewable power—wind turbines require a considerable amount of copper—and of electric vehicles, which use four times the copper of cars with internal combustion engines. Barron’s highlighted the “green economy” demand for the metal in a cover story earlier this year.· Freeport now trades for 10 times projected 2022 earnings of $3.50 a share and yields under 1%. Now that Freeport’s net debt has shrunk to a target of $3.4 billion, dividends and buybacks should ramp up in 2022.“Freeport is leveraged to copper, has low costs, and is growing volumes,” LaFemina says. “The capital return story is just beginning.” He has a $60 price target on the stock and an above-consensus 2022 earnings estimate of more than $6 a share, assuming copper prices at $5.50 a pound.LaFemina is also partial to BHP, Rio Tinto, and Anglo American, noting that they have single-digit price/earnings ratios and high dividends. BHP and Rio Tinto now yield 9%, although their dividends are irregular."
at some point the market is going to have to give fcx the $4 copper points back..
Interesting how copper keeps dropping yet FCX bid refuses to go south of $34. Copper at $4.1262. Hmmmm.....somebody bolstering the bid I suppose? So the question is...for how long? Bid $34.22.
This is going back to 40 baby
Hyper inflation pushes commodities higher.... OECD central banks promoting QE (printing) globally. Deficits need to be covered.. they cannt taper... QE for ever. Commodity Super cycle beginning.
"Just another glance.....of new production over 2020 levels from some new mines coming online.NEW copper mining operations ramping up NEW CAPACITY in 2022:a) Quellaveco / AA / Peru / +125k mt in 2022, going up to +280k mt in 2023.b) Quebrada Blanco Phase 2 / Teck-Sumitomo / +80k mt in 2022, going up to +180k mt. in 2023.c) Udokan / Baikal / Russia / +75k mt in 2022, going up to +140k mt in 2023.d) Mutanda / Glencore / DRC / +170k mt in 2022, going up to +200 mt in 2023.e) Julong / Zijin / Tibet / +75k mt in 2022, going up to +150k mt in 2023.The following are lessor new operations starting up in 2022, or operations whose ramp-up will span several year to reach capacity, that will add to 2022 mined copper supply, and increasingly so in forward years:Deep Głogów, Los Pelambres Phases 2/3, Esperanza Sur, Zalvardar Chlorine, Bingham Canyon, El Pilar, Pilares, Sudbury, Salobo III, Alemão, Las Bambas, Doubaoshan, Mantoverde, Aktogay Ph. 2, Yoshlik, Tenke Fungarume, All of this and more from the dozens of smaller oxide SX-EW operations starting up in China, DRC, etc.Lots of new copper coming to markets near you in the months and years ahead.And who says miners aren't increasing supply ?Dummies."

"One reason FCX down today could be RBC cutting RIO price target from GBP 58 to 56 as RIO, BHP, SCCO all down"
What's going on in the copper market to explain the move we saw Friday and this morning?

"ICSG posted May data on the state of the copper market on Friday. Every 20th of the month, ladies. Get with the program.""Preliminary data indicates that world copper mine production increased by 4.8% over the first five months of 2021, with concentrate production increasing by around 6.5% and solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) declining by about 2%:"">World mine production started to recover in June 2020 as lockdown measures easedand the industry adapted to stricter health protocols. However, government-imposedrestrictions related to COVID-19 and preventative measures implemented by theindustry to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 continue to constrain output in a fewcountries this year.>Production in Chile, the world’s biggest copper mine producing country, was down by2% in the first 5 months of this year with a 2% growth in concentrate production beingmore than offset by a 13% decline in SX-EW output.>Output in Peru, the world’s second biggest copper mine producing country, increasedby 17% mainly because March-May production was up by 35% from a constrained March-May 2020 basis when the industry was severely impacted by the COVID-19 related country lockdown. However, Jan-May 2021 production is still 7% below that of Jan-May 2019.Fun news."
"Gold 1,750 Copper 4.37 Look for 4.40 Today. FCX Red will turn Green as it runs by 39 on the way to 40. Hope you are long and bought FCX stock. Lets say goodby to Shorts. Let's see how today plays out."
"Apologies to anyone who may have covered this but China's ""shared prosperity"" announcement was a bit disturbing, wasn't it? If the government drives wealth out of the country, that can't be good for capital investments ... and that can't be good for copper prices.I think copper prices will get a boost with early reports of covid being under control... especially in Asia. I was optimistic about Chinese copper consumption after that but ... now, I'm not sure how this communism stuff will work.Someone said that we shouldn't be surprised when a communist country acts like a communist country."
Randall thank you for your diligent handle on info sharing along with a number of others. cheerful safe weekend
"Bouncy bounce day? Copper at $4.0862. PM FCX bid $32.60. Maybe. But it's Friday, options exp and all the rest, plus it's getting to the latter half of Aug....the notorious dog days of the game....so let's see how it plays from here. G/L!"
"Outotec to provide smelter technology for Freeport Indonesian smelter: Metso Outotec to provide copper smelting engineering, tech to PT Freeport?s Manyar projectPosted by Daniel Gleeson on 21st July 2021Metso Outotec has signed a major engineering and technology contract as well as licence agreements for the delivery of what it says is a landmark copper smelter complex to be built in Gresik, East Java, in Indonesia.The project owner is PT Freeport Indonesia, with PT Chiyoda International Indonesia being the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Four-fifths of the approximately #$%$360 million ($424 million) contract has been booked in the company?s Metals? September quarter order intake and the rest in Minerals? September quarter order intake, it said.Metso Outotec?s scope of delivery is based on the licensed Metso Outotec Flash Smelting, Flash Converting and Lurec� technology. It includes the design and supply of key process equipment and process control systems for the main areas of the smelter complex, the copper electrolytic refinery, the gas cleaning and sulphuric acid plant, the slag concentrator and the effluent treatment plant.Metso Outotec has previously provided certain front-end engineering design and other advance engineering services for this 1.7 Mt/y copper concentrate smelter complex, which is expected to be commissioned in 2024. According to PT Freeport, the Manyar smelter will be the largest copper processing site in the world upon start up.Pekka Vauramo, President & CEO, Metso Outotec, said: ?Our joint efforts with Freeport Indonesia and Chiyoda will set a new standard for the copper smelter industry in fulfilling the strictest international environmental standards and efficiency requirements. We are very happy to work together to implement this game changing copper smelter.?Jari �lgars, President, Metals business area at Metso Outotec, added: ?We have worked with Freeport Indonesia and Chiyoda for several years to ensure and select the best available process design and technologies for the Manyar project.?Metso Outotec has delivered 51 Copper Flash Smelters around the world, with the company?s Copper Flash Smelting the most widely applied technology for copper smelting in the world, it said. The solution is also one of its Planet Positive solutions. Using this technology, Metso Outotec?s customers avoided more than 1.6 Mt of CO2 emissions in 2020, the company said"
Trading thoughts. The action keeps dancing and pushing the bid to $37. Which makes me think that's where it's going to go. So if it breaks then the next (Fib) target line is the 50% retracement line at $36.60. So the set-ups are pretty clear around the $37 line. G/L!
guys FYI I think they did that as a good fait like BVN did last week.https://www.mining.com/web/cerro-verde-pays-245m-tax-debt-under-protest/
"People are losing faith in copper prices.It's why with copper at $4.38 today, FCX trades for a price lower today, than when copper spiked in late Feb.And it's just going to get worse with even the mild assault that China has begun on world copper prices."
What would a 10-15% correction in the broader market do to FCX ?What would a 20-30% beat down in the broader market do to FCX ?All good questions.....and probably the answer is spooky.
"Copper at $4.3225. It's slippery. Basically it has given back all the upside it experienced from middle to end of July. PM FCX bid $35.50. Given the way copper is acting, and given the markets overall, it seems the percentage play for now is on the sell side of the table. In all honesty my focus is less on this equity and sector right now, and more on the likes of the yield curve spreads along with the upcoming claims numbers. ADP came out yesterday at ~350K in employment #'s, when the street was expecting over 650K. That's a bad miss. It was ugly. There's not a correlation between ADP and the upcoming claims number necessarily, but some are thinking that if that (claims) number comes in higher than expected...and the expected number being tossed around is ~390K...if that number comes in higher....say well north of 400K.....well...it ain't good news..So that has my attention. Let's see how it plays from here. G/L!"
Bid $34.54. Looks like nobody wants to be holding ahead of the Fed and Jerome show tomorrow. Can't say I blame 'em. Can you?
"As noted by Switch (below) copper continues the rout that picked up speed yesterday. Now at $3.9668. As you might expect all hell (so to speak) is breaking loose with FCX. PM bid $32.70. And it's probably not going to get much better, what with Dow futures off over 260pts at this writing. Let's see how the day plays. G/L!"
Copper continues to sag. Now $4.2198. Of course FCX bid at $34.67. Path of least resistance is down. So play along? G/L!
"For those looking for a Taper tantrum, George, Kaplan and Bullard have all pitched in saying get it done before more damage is done. Bullard, in particular, wants it completed by end Q1 22."
"FCX should keep moving up Volume has been low, FCX needs a breakout day with over 25 Million shares traded. 38 End of week 40 First week of Sept. Gold over 1,800 Copper 4.24 Look for Copper to hangout around 4.30 maybe a notch over by weeks end. Escondida did Miners in Chile a huge favor with the contract they were able to get.Set a high standard for pay. Codelco one mine still striking lots of talk going on at the other operations."
"Don't think I would want to own Twitter stock Tomorrow. Just my thoughts haven't seen anything just think it will noise dive, over who's allowed and not allowed on there service . Will watch and see. Just looked there stock 62.52"
The data is now indisputable… man made global warming is resulting in adverse climate change…..fcx will contribute the copper for clean energy and the new electrical grid .
"FCX getting 000000 love Today Gold 1,787 Copper 4.32 Market Green FCX Down 1.21 Cents Today. With Low Low Volume Machines have had a very good control on price having it there own way without struggle."
copper will keep moving up. You have to buy the dips. 36 coming easy
"ICSG calls for small sup.usof 80,000 tonnes in 2021....110,000 in 2022.....if give this context, GS commented that China uses 50,000 tonnes in 36 hours....will the yoy numbers for China fall? Definitely....now let's look out a year....what will China's numbers look like? Pretty big relative to 2021....that's just math....Did Escondida get settled because BHP thought copoer is going to 3.30? Is Peru forecasting 50% higher tax revenue with the same production because copper goes lower? Doubt it....Will the low end analysts targets for the price copper gradually move higher? It's already happening"
"OT question. Income is usually considered a function of production isn't it? Ummm....excepting all you trust baby types living off the income stream of your trust fund (heh). Overall in America your income is a function of what you produce from working. So what becomes an economy when money is being given out to folks not working? Now don't get me wrong I'm all for unemployment benefits and insurance....so long as it's a fixed duration. There are few folks in life who haven't had the ""between job"" experience. But when ""between jobs"" becomes a lifestyle choice because the Fed keeps sending you money....what does that mean for the economy? Is it such a wonder that our import debt to the likes of China is soaring to outwards of the orbit of Pluto right now? How long do you think this can be sustained, eh? Just something to contemplate....meanwhile...bid $34.40...."

"I love how people on the Right on this board keep saying Socialism has no place in Amerikkka. Well, guess what? You do know that just about every type of insurance is socialized in terms of costs right? Whether it’s medical, property, life, commercial, etc. That’s just for starters. Is Medicare socialism? Should we just get rid of Medicare? Let’s just keep the existing Medicare until it goes bankrupt. When the bennies run out, so be it (all existing workers stop paying both Medicare and social security taxes, same for companies). In fact, let the US Government just take on more debt and pay back any outstanding obligations, and raise taxes to pay back that debt. How would that work out for society? Think there would be any decline in pretty much all our cities? Think crime may go up? Drug use? How about gun ownership to even higher levels? Think your little suburbs would remain immune? Don’t make me laugh!"
The only materials I have left after exiting $FCX. The catalyst for $NUE is the domestic infrastructure story
"Copper prices today not acting like there will be any short-lived strike at Escondida.Today's trading range for /HGQ1:CMX is over a dime (per pound) today, as copper see-sawwed on its way down.Wild swings, but closing down on the low of the day.News out of Chile is that BHP has largely met the demands of the union, on the bonus demanded and other freebie benefits the union wanted. An more arbitration time is being demanded for heads to cool off.Lots of shouting apparently, and gov't wants everyone to cool off so more time will likely be granted on gov't meditation."
Bid $36.98. Hmmm...maybe this time.....maybe......?
Looks like the object is to close the bid at/around the 50% Fib line of .60.
"OT --After 20 years and a trillion dollars, it was right for the US to pull troops from Afghanistan. The Taliban had to move quickly in order to appear that they had driven out the US forces… bad optics but probably unavoidable.The former administration had made a deal with the Taliban that the US would pull out in April. Right or wrong, they believed the Taliban would not participate in anti-US terrorist activities with Al-Qaeda.The current administration ignored the deal but decided to pull US troops in August. It appears to have been poorly executed and too many Democrats on TV are now annoyingly looking to blame the former president.I don’t know why Democrats can’t just accept credit for doing the right thing. It was not perfect. So what? It went a lot better then attempts to fix the border crisis or to slow the continuing pandemic."
Do not care to dwell on what reasons move copper price as long as I know the fact that the longer it stays above $4 FCX generate more cash flow resulting it be more undervalued. I do not need to know the detail of mining copper.Watch the money flow and price action FCX to try to trade short or long term.Keep it simple you make some you lose someNaive if expect the mm know a lot than you or me except bids and ask and they make a living out of it already.
Doesn't appear to matter that copper is moving northward. As usual market forces appear to see this as a reason to move the bid south. $37.83.

"Chinese Trade Data Continues to PerplexShare Cafe'ECONOMICS / MARKETSAugust 9, 2021By Glenn DyerRelevant excerpts:Another so-so monthly trade report from China – this time for the month of July.Nothing much outstanding – another solid rise in exports and imports and a small dip in the size of the surplus.The National Customs Agency said imports of refined products rose 31.9%, natural gas (27.1%), copper ores & concentrates (5.1%), steel products (649.03%), and coal (169.74%).In contrast, imports fell for crude oil (-19.6%), unwrought copper (-44.3%), iron ore (-12.06%), soybeans (-14.1%), edible oil (-13.6%), rubber (-22.5%), and meat (-15%).Outbreaks of Covid Delta cases in eastern and southern Chinese provinces – the country’s main export hubs – continue to grow and Chinese media reports suggest the infections and lockdowns have crimped factory output.New infections in July, mainly caused by the Delta strain has spread to tens of Chinese cities, prompting local authorities to lock down affected communities, order millions to be tested and temporarily suspend operations of some businesses, including factories.The restrictions in and around the capital, Beijing are reported to be especially tough.According to the China Daily, Jiangsu province reported 53 new locally transmitted cases on Friday. Among the cases, one was found in Nanjing and 52 were detected in Yangzhou.Since July 28, Yangzhou has reported 272 local cases, including 17 in serious condition and another four in critical condition.The paper also reported that six local officials of an airline, the local health commission and government had been punished for failures in Covid prevention and controls.Seasonal floods and bad weather last month also affected industrial production in some areas such as central China.=========================================================================================Doesn't appear than various of the ""sino-vaccines"" do anything to prevent a Mutant Wuhan virus.This is going SOUTH, ladies.............China' imports of key raw materials was much worse than expected in July.Better buckle up."
"Great morning everyone!Thinking about the handling of our coming riches. Having met debt targets, cash will continue rolling in and I am concerned FCX has not been more open about their plans. I have seen some talk on this board and even analyst statements of cash return being some combination of dividend and share repurchase. NO, a thousand times NO. Simply, i demand this be in the form of direct to shareholder cash returns. Not repurchase. Think about it?Forward earning will have our PE well into single digits. Advantage to company in repurchase to to slightly improve PE, which will do nothing for us. And they would save dividends on shares bought back -- saving a whopping 1% -- a complete waste. Give your shareholders the cash, plain and simple. Our yield will be more enticing to prospective buyers than a small PE change.Please guys, speak up about this!"
"Copper climbs to 6-week high on floods in top buyer ChinaMonday July 26, 2021 07:41Kitco NewsShare this article:LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Copper prices rose on Monday as floods in top consumer China sparked demand hopes at a time when inventories were falling, while a softer dollar also supported prices.Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.8% to $9,593 per tonne by 1100 GMT after touching its highest since June 16 at $9,665. It was on track for a fifth straight session of gains.Floods in central China, especially in the industrial and transport hub city of Zhengzhou in Henan province, have raised supply concerns and demand for rebuilding damaged infrastructure. Copper is mainly used in the construction and power industries and China accounts for about half of global copper consumption.""Sentiment has brightened again in the last few days, reflected in the copper price,"" Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said, adding he believed copper was due for a correction, having hit a record of above $10,700 a tonne in May.A Singapore-based trader said the market was pricing in disruptions to output from floods in Henan and demand for reconstruction.INVENTORIES: On warrant copper stocks in LME-registered warehouses fell to 205,800 tonnes while metal in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell to their lowest since Feb. 10 at 96,087 tonnes.PREMIUMS: In a sign of rising physical demand in China, Yangshan premiums have climbed to $47.50 a tonne from recent lows of $21 touched in June.SPREADS: The discount of LME copper over three-month contract narrowed to about $21 a tonne from about $40 a tonne two weeks ago.

Usage over the first five months of this year is estimated to have increased byabout 3.8% compared to the same period of 2020 but is still 5% below that in the firstfive months of 2019.""Not very inspiring......when talking about the non-China demand story.""Chinese apparent usage (excluding changes in bonded/unreported stocks) increasedby around 5%. ""This changes for the worse in June, July, and every month in 2021 afterwards until Dec.......beware reading too much into China somehow being the savior of the copper market this year."
"Time to get up, ladies. You got enough beauty sleep.Latest LME data8/13 LME inventory: 235,550 metric tonnes.Only 13,100 has cancelled warrants (load out tickets) applied against it. That's only 6% of inventory !!!94% of the rest of the copper in LME warehouses worldwide.......... NOBODY WANTS to take delivery of.Load out % is the LOWEST in years at 6%.Normally, cancelled warrants % of total stocks average anywhere from 20-50%. In periods of real tightness, that number can be as high as 70-80%.At present, copper demand is NOT ROBUST and this LME data proves it.And copper is flowing out of Shanghai bonded copper zone, back into LME sheds in S. Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.Two months ago, there was nothing in LME Asian warehouses, as virtually the entire LME warehouse inventory was Rotterdam, and Hamburg. Now, Asian LME sheds are filliing back up.Chinese parties that brought LME copper into the Shanghai bonded zone last year, are sending it back to LME by way of selling contracts, and delivering on those LME contracts (to LME Asian warehouses).Copper demand stinks, people. The LME data (aka: evidence) bears this out.Aurubis, Europe's largest copper smelter just reported their latest results, and they are loaded to the gills with unsold product inventory. Largest balances in years. Stated in Euro.Codelco: Has $1.2 billion in mostly copper inventory, stated at costs (in USD).FCX: Has $1.6 billion in inventory, most of which will be copper, and nearly $1 billion is finished product cathode, stated at cost.Two biggest primary copper miners..................loaded to the gills with copper inventory.There is plenty of copper awash in the industry, contrary to the myths and fables being peddled by Wall Street touts.You people can read footnotes, right ?Codelco's quarterly FS are reviewed by PWC, and FCX quarterly 10-Q's are reviewed by E&Y, so you know the numbers are probably pretty tight.Devil is in those details.............and that's where the copper is hiding.On the balance sheets of miners and smelters, as they try to keep it off the exchanges (for now)."
"Hey Krew, I did some FWIW data-plays on FCX and Cu ... as many have noticed, lately FCX is not fully keeping pace with the rise in Cu.The following is suitable for printing or wrapping fish (where is that quote from?) a) I created a FCX/Cu Multiple (""M"") from Feb 26 to todayb) The midpoint day is May 11 where FCX hit its max SP of $44.71. Cu was $4.78, and M was 9.36.c) The average M over the last 103 days is 8.59.d) The highest M was June 1 @ 9.46, the lowest July 16 @ 7.66.e) In the last 6 trading days, M has never been over 8.00.f) Today was $35.19/4.41 = 7.99Todays' multiple is about 7% below the average.If today had closed at the average M, FCX would have been $37.83 (vs actual $35.19).If today had closed at the highest M of 9.46, FCX would have been $41.70.So FCX has to catch up or Cu is coming down to get into the average zone.Please note: I am not attesting that the above is anything brilliant, incisive, directional, etc etc. Am just sharing, that's all.Have a good week-end!"

"Copper price falls as China’s import volumes drop by over 10%MININGAugust 9, 202110:09 am Markets Top Companies China Latin America Copper Excerpts:Copper prices fell to their lowest in more than two weeks on Monday as a firm dollar and demand worries weighed on sentiment.Copper for delivery in September fell 1.4% from Friday’s settlement price, touching $4.285 per pound ($9,427 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York.China’s January-to-July copper import volumes dropped by more than a tenth compared with the first seven months of 2020.The biggest copper buyer in the world bought 3.219 million tonnes of unwrought copper and copper products from January to July, down 10.6% compared with the same period in 2020.“The dollar is one factor behind the selling and the other is Chinese demand,” one copper trader told Reuters, adding that the rising risks of a strike at the Escondida mine in Chile helped to contain losses.Slowing in Chinese growth:Refined copper production by China’s major smelters was little changed in July from the previous month, state-backed research house Antaike said on Monday.The 22 smelters surveyed by Antaike churned out 747,200 tonnes of copper cathodes last month, up slightly from 745,700 tonnes in June and up 7.7% year-on-year.China’s factory activity expanded in July at the slowest pace in 17 months, with the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) easing to 50.4 from 50.9 in June, remaining above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction.“Industrial metals are increasingly feeling the weight of a synchronized slowing in US and Chinese growth,” TD Securities analysts led by Bart Melek said in a note.======================================================================================Quick, someone poke the snowflake maharaja and tell him. He might be napping. Escondida's potential strike won't hold copper up forever.And if it occurs, it won't do much to dent copper supply anyway."
"Perhaps some of you FCX Super Copper Bulls underestimated China's ability to absolute DESTROY the price of a commodity...............Well, copper is their next target.They're still chewin' on iron ore, crashing it down.Copper is next.They want $3.30 per pound, or else.And so it shall be.It's still a good price for FCX, whose stock will trade in the mid-$20 per share then.It will pay reasonable dividends (annually) to Florida retirees, too.But DON'T expect to get rich holding a few thousand shares of FCX at these levels.Just not gonna happen.I know this company 10 ways to Tuesday, inside out, backwards...................worked for a predecessor once and another time, a partner. FCX is a slow boat, and the real time to make money has passed.Congrats to all of us who did.This flat-tire stock is going to $25, whereby it becomes the next de-facto utility stock.Boring. Lame. Bulls-Eye target.Find something else to own if you want growth because this pig isn't it."
We are going higher
"Copper 4.04 Was 3.96 look to close above 4.05 today Copper and FCX 32.18 will go back up from here Covid/Delta and Lots of fear sending Copper, Lumber,Iron Ore Down not because of demand but because Investors are afraid. Talking heads are driving stocks down so they can buy a lower price, hold and buy more this will last 1 to 2 weeks. all that going down will come back first."
"So, yesterday, after golf, I had to charge my e-Tron. Came back to my suburban city. There are 7 public chargers within the limits. They were all being used (including mine). My city is installing two more chargers. A local high rise is exploring alternatives to install 2-4 fast chargers for its residents. Once this building does that word will spread, and I expect at least 7-8 other high rises to do the same. Other localities are putting in chargers at city parks, shopping centers with grocery store anchors are putting in chargers (WF already has them). Even Walmart, which I don’t shop at, has them. I’m suggesting to Costco, to put it in as a member benefit (you put your member card and pay, but it will be Costco pricing, just a small profit margin on top of electricity price).I realize this is all anecdotal, but we’re about to witness an incredible increase in the numbers of public chargers in my opinion."
Climate has been changing since the dinosaurs went extinct. Co2 levels much higher when man did not roam the earth. Have you forgotten the acid rain crisis? The global cooling crisis? The global warming crisis? Political activist need a bogey man to scare the voters and investors.
"From BHPLooking even further out, long term demand from traditional end–uses is expected to be solid, while broad exposure to the electrification mega–trend offers attractive upside. Grade decline, resource depletion, water constraints, the increased depth and complexity of known development options and a scarcity of high–quality future development opportunities are likely to result in the higher prices needed to attract sufficient investment to balance the market. It is these parameters that are critical for assessing where the marginal tonne of primary copper will come from in the long run and what it will cost. We estimate that grade decline could remove –2 Mt per annum of mine supply by 2030, with resource depletion potentially removing an additional –1½ and –2¼ Mt per annum by this date, depending upon the specifics of the case under consideration."

"What’s it like to wake up every morning, thinking about how to humiliate a person or persons who insulted you or called you “wrong""? What’s it like having the same thoughts all morning to late afternoon? Do these thoughts keep some awake all night? I'll bet they do.An obsession with revenge against an anonymous person may seem highly unusual but observations on this board conclude that it may be typical psychology. “Even though the first few moments feel rewarding in the brain, psychological scientists have found that instead of quenching hostility, revenge prolongs the unpleasantness of the original offense. Instead of delivering justice, revenge often creates only a cycle of retaliation.”I have to wonder about the self-image of those who are obsessed with retaliation, humiliation, and “winning"". I suspect that many use these anonymous boards to project an image opposite of their true selves or situations. I suspect that many live relatively unhappy lives.I have no problem with posters defending themselves when challenged but constant verbal attacks by one group against another are boorish and off-putting to others. I don’t expect anyone to change as a result of this post. If it's annoying or offensive to the obsessed individuals, I'm happy to hear it."
"COLUMN-China goes from driver to brake for crude oil, iron ore and copper: RussellReutersBy Clyde RussellAUG 8, 2021 8:57PM EDTExcerpts:LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 9 (Reuters) - China has switched from driving global demand for major commodities to being a drag on growth, with July's customs data confirming the weakening trend for imports of crude oil, iron ore and copper.Copper imports also fell for a fourth straight month, with China buying 424,280 tonnes of unwrought metal, down from June's 428,437 tonnes and only slightly more than half the record 762,211 tonnes from July last year.The release of 50,000 tonnes from China's state reserves and a loss of some momentum in key manufacturing indexes are most likely behind the softer imports of the industrial metal.Additionally a change in import rules to allow purchases of higher-grade scrap copper also likely weighed on imports of refined copper, and since this a structural change, it may continue to have an impact in coming months.Overall, the July trade data shows that China's commodity imports have moderated from the robust levels associated with last year's stimulus as part of Beijing's efforts to boost the economy in the wake of the pandemic.It's likely that the rest of 2021 will see imports more around levels recorded in 2019, prior to the pandemic, rather than in the second half of 2020, when the stimulus was in full swing.This means that they will remain solid, but won't be the engine that drove commodity prices sharply higher in the second half of last year and the first half of this year.========================================================================================It's all about China going forward. Their refusal to buy surplus copper in Western markets will unravel the entire world copper market.The EU-28, US, Japan, S. Korea, India doesn't use 1/2 the copper than China does, annually.And China's demand for copper metal is COLLAPSING.Down -43% in July 2021 vs. July 2020.As for the bromide about 2019.............The average copper price was $2.72 per pound in 2019.Something to chew on, huh, Super Copper Bulls.......?!?!?!?!?I'm only predicting that copper falls to $3.30 per pound later this year.Remember to tell the snowflake maharaja, since he's run off to hide."

"From this morning's 8K - not a surprise, but FCX selling off some non strategic assets. More cash coming in.On July 26, 2021, Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (“FCX”) 56% owned subsidiary, Koboltti Chemicals Holdings Limited, entered into an agreement to sellits specialty cobalt business based in Kokkola, Finland (“Freeport Cobalt”) to Jervois Mining Limited (“Jervois”). This business was no longerstrategic to FCX following the sale of its interests in Tenke Fungurume in 2016 and its cobalt refinery in Kokkola in 2019.Under the terms of the transaction, Jervois will acquire 100% of Freeport Cobalt for $85 million (in cash and Jervois shares) plus working capital tobe determined at closing. In addition, FCX and its noncontrolling interest partners will have the right to receive up to $40 million in contingent cashconsideration based on the future performance of the business.Under the terms of the agreement, the consideration at closing may include up to 9.9% of Jervois shares. Assuming a full allotment of shares, FCXcurrently estimates its net share of the proceeds, excluding contingent consideration, would approximate $100 million cash plus its pro rata 56%share of 9.9% of Jervois shares.The financial contribution of the business was not significant to FCX’s financial results during 2020 and the first half of 2021.The transaction is subject to the completion of Jervois financing and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarterof 2021."

Well what will happen when Copper Market opens at 6pm ? I think Copper goes up overnight. Asian Market's will go up to Show Strength and they are the world Power. Expect China to show the World follow us we will lead you to the Promise Land. My thoughts Copper moves back around 4.25 by end of Month and FCX moves up 37.00 by weeks end.
"OT....cu is correlated to China past and future growth. If you are trading Chinese companies listed on American exchanges...a risk is: they delist (analyst on fast money mentioned the risk) This is the delisting risk.. many Chinese companies have done this in the past. FUQI (prior #1 ibd stock) and group reverse merger shells. What they do is stop reporting quarterly & annual reports... exchanges delist companies, institutions sell shares, eventually stock stops trading and shares have no value. China doesn't honor us laws... good luck with class action. US investor loses. Chinese company relists on Chinese market selling equity to new Chinese investor. US investor has zero value."
"Copper at $4.3720 looks like it wants to go back to the .40 line or north of it. Again.PM FCX bid $37.14. I hope others' have been makin' the monies off the upsie downsie sine wave action of the bid over the last few weeks. It's done a few round trips from ~$34 to ~$38 hasn't it? Pull up a 180 day chart and you can see it. And having been lucky in the placement of traps and such, ostensibly playing off the gamble that the pattern will continue, I've done nicely. I can't complain as it's keeping the frig well stocked. Now let's see how this week plays out. G/L"
"This is actually a good day for FCX......Copper down a nickel.Dow off.China confirms it has a serious copper tummy ache (with more copper tummy ache to come).Peru copper mines making up all the lost production from last year, by June 2021.And FCX is down less than two dimes ?Not too shabby.Hopes and prayers for an Escondida strike must be adding ""something sticky"" to the equation.That's probably not going to happen either, and if it does, will be short-lived, and have little real impact.The copper price pop from Escondida probably already happened two weeks ago, and it has run its course.Stay tuned, ladies...."
"WS dumps the miners!Between the sudden but short duration metal price crashes this past week, RIO, BHP and to an extent FcX share prices have been hit hard - the former two quite dramatically despite extraordinary profits and shareholder returns. On the FcX front - Vanguard and Blackrock have shed about 28M shares this past quarter. Fidelity, State Street and JP Morgan picked up about 22M shares between them. While the overall institutional ownership remains around 78% - some of these portfolio changes are interesting. Vanguard which held a consistent 152M shares - has dropped about 40M this year and in particular their MidCap Indexes dropped 22M shares - sold out all shares. One could argue that they feel no more cap appreciation to be had or don’t care about the dividends that maybe in the cards. On the other had - the number of hedge funds owning FcX shares has climbed to its all time high of 76! That may portend cap appreciation interest!FcX will have zero net debt by Q4 21. It will have the potential to pay a 3$ dividend in 22 if copper stays above 4$ and then drop in 2023 absent additional growth from the low hanging US options! Their silence on succession planning and any shareholder payouts until 2022 tells me they are either ultra conservative or avoiding any poison pills!BHP has made some gutsy calls - selling their coal assets and merging their Oil assets with Woodside. They also announced their 5.7 B potash Jansen project - but on their CC mentioned that could get axed if it did not meet their CaPex alloc criteria. Their CEO was not glowing about their copper portfolio and did not mention Spence on the call. There was some mention of reducing their operational footprint in Chile as well. If I was betting man, I would say they could pull the trigger on a merger for copper assets - hopefully with FcX. I was more bullish on RIO making a play, but will all the uncertainty with the variant and ability to dampen copper prices, not sure on a mega deal is in the works with RIO!In the meantime, the Wall Street roulette will continue around options and stale FcX share price. Let’s hope FcX makes some announcement soon on SH returns - or gets bought out to avoid the single driver of copper price to hold them up or blow them down!"
"It's early but copper at $4.5125. PM FCX bid now $38.63. Another week of mischief ahead. And we're into the ""dog days"" of August. Meaning probably light volume which allows for a maximum amount of game play being done to the bid. My interpretation, of course.In any case regarding copper and its merits I suggest going over to YouTube and reviewing a video that was actually done by CNBC. It's entitled; ""Why A Looming Copper Shortage Has Big Consequences For The Green Economy.""Most of what they go over is known by those here, but it's interesting to see this video as a reflection of the public ""mind"" concerning our good Doctor. Bodes well if it plays out. But as always...let's see what actually happens. G/L!"

"A Bloomberg article late TuesdayTight near-term supplies and rising demand in U.S.U.S. copper buyers are paying the world’s highest prices for the metal as soaring demand and logistical bottlenecks send New York futures surging ahead of contracts in London and Shanghai.Copper futures for September delivery on the Comex have been trading at a premium to those for December delivery since Friday in a condition called backwardation that suggests tight near-term supplies and rising demand. is the only main exchange where the metal is trading in backwardation right now, and inventories at warehouses tracked by the bourse have been declining since early April.As a result, a New York trader is paying over $250 a metric ton more for Comex copper than the metal traded on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday, the widest since 2011. The New York price is also higher than in China, excluding a value-added tax on Shanghai purchases.The premium underscores investor assessments of diverging outlooks for the regions. Commodities from copper to steel have posted big gains this year, partly on bets that massive U.S. government spending to rebuild infrastructure will boost demand. Pandemic-triggered supply-chain woes have also helped lift prices. Meanwhile, Europe has been slower to recover from the pandemic, while concerns over China’s efforts to rein in inflation have clouded prospects for commodity gains there.“At the root of it all is the friction in global trade, but it’s also a reflection of the fact that demand is strong. It genuinely looks like a tight market,” said Oliver Nugent, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. “If you look outside of the LME, and you look at the U.S. and even at China, you can see that they’re moving in the right direction.”The tightness in the U.S. market is in contrast with the situation on the London Metal Exchange. LME copper cash contracts are trading at a discount to futures contracts, while stocks tracked by LME warehouses have been on the rise since the beginning of June.“If you look at Rotterdam, and how loose the spreads are generally on the LME, it’s such a big tanker to turn around, and it looks like there’s a long way to go,” said Nugent, referring to copper stocks at LME Rotterdam warehouses, which have risen more than 40% since the start of last month.Metals including copper slipped on Tuesday amid China’s tech crackdown and concerns over the spreading delta variant of Covid-19. Comex copper futures for September delivery fell 0.9% to $4.5445 an ounce in New York, equivalent to about $10,019 a metric ton. In London, LME copper slipped 0.5% at $9,758.50 a ton."

"Somebody is showing, SHOWING, over 150K large on the ask when it was at $38.50. That was a clear statement. A fairly large show for this equity.

I suspect the bid isn't going to be allowed north of it until somebody finishes setting their table..."

"Have now read all of the earnings release on co website. My initial takes:-- Production a bit less than April estimates provided.-- Costs a bit higher than estimates.-- Earnings a bit less than I expected.-- Realized prices are stunning to me. Excellent.-- Debt reduction exactly what I expected.Street will see al this as a minor disappointment, at least initially.Looking to next year is the exciting part. IF, and perhaps with recent shortfall more a concern, they reach their production goals and prices for sales hang where the are, 2022 would seem to be ~ $4 sh net. Current street estimates are ~ $3.6. And achieving the debt goals they are firmly setting the expectation of big time cash distributions.On balance I am pleased. Long term looks very bright to me. Short term pop to bail me out on Aug calls much less than I hoped. Color from conference call, as it relates to 'math' of next year distributions are of primary interest to me.Good luck folks. Numbers WILL continue to improve."

"Last week I posted a bear/bull case scenario for the CC. The sentiment on this board follows the ‘normal curve’ of perception and appears just ‘Neutral’… just presenting some facts:No. FcX meets /beats sales est of 975 M lbs Cu and 330K oz of goldY. Grasberg on track or fasterNo. S.A. mines much better and improvingSorta. Same old bull case story of great copper market and shareholder returns in the future - but clearer announcement towards special dividend or buyback soonSorta. Some update on new US opportunities with timeline and potential volumesY. Smelter option finalizedN. Good answer if asked to address impact 2023 Grasberg ownership transfer (NOT ASKED)Y. Earnings beat by a couple of cents above expectationsY. OCF comes in over 1.6, FCF at least 1.2B and net debt down to under 4BTo each his/her own: IMO - this was a great CC for a company that trades on egg shells - led by the greatest copper bull, yet most conservative approach to projections and guidance!From the CC Q&A:- GS on why wait till the EOY to return cash to SH? Good answer from KQ that it is being evaluated, will return as promised, and slight hint in her hesitant tone that it could be earlier than EOY 2021- GS on Grasberg ramp up completion… KQs positive thump was pretty much all of Q4 should be running full rates - a bit of acceleration.- CLF from Jeffries - why no reflection on higher production from new projects- KQ said these will yield at least some additional output in 2023 - possibly in 2022. This was the closest to see if 2023 Grasberg transition was was being looked at for mitigation!My take on FcX:- Conservative and will manage smooth earnings profile - so a great beat on EPS is not in the cards- Great focus on cash flow generation - they beat their previous guesstimate by 700M … and came in at 2.35B- Will likely end up with 1.3B to 1.6B to return to shareholders this year… 90c to 1.1$ in Divvy or some buyback (their Sh Out has brown by 30M since June 2020… likely options issues)... and a similar amount left over for projects or further strengthening the balance sheet- FcX does not have a history of carrying a lot of cash... why hold close to 10B if you are not buying down debt or making a big project investment... will create speculation of buying something which is not in the cards from RA and KQ over and over again! Hence, I would not be surprised to see an earlier announcement on the SH return - cannot recall how they announced the special divvys (timing of) during the early 2010’s… history has a way of repeating itself. I called the reinstatement of divvy (30c/sh) announcement timing by looking at historical announcements! Right now - its the Russian Roulette at the Options Casino table that is pegging the PPS… 35$ Max Pain strike price for today!"

"Talks at World’s Top Copper Mine Are Heading for a Tense FinaleBloombergBy James AttwoodAugust 6, 2021, 8:15 PM EDTExcerpts:A months-long wage negotiation at the world’s biggest copper mine is heading into a tense finale over the coming days.The main union at Chile’s Escondida is calling on workers to be ready to strike amid limited progress in mediated talks. But owner BHP Group said it had made substantial improvements and vowed to continue its practice of not sweetening offers during strikes.Wage talks at a mine that accounts for about 5% of global production are being closely watched by the copper market as trillions of dollars in government stimulus fuel demand for industrial metals. Traders will have to navigate Chile’s somewhat complex labor rules to figure out the likely next steps.After workers rejected BHP’s final wage offer in regular talks, the company exercised its option of a five-day mediation period in a bid to avert a strike. That period ends Monday. If the two sides fail to reach a deal by then, they could agree to extend mediation for as many as five more business days or a legal strike could begin.The two sides don’t seem too far apart in terms of benefits. The union requested a bonus equivalent to 1% of the company’s profit, which would be about 21 million pesos ($26,600) each worker. In regular talks, the company offered 18 million pesos apiece and says it has sweetened terms during mediation. They may be further apart in base wages.According to consultancy firm Plusmining, any strike would probably be shorter than the 44-day stoppage that roiled the copper market in 2017. The union would have the option, as it took up four years ago, to end the strike by freezing the current contract for 18 months and negotiate again, without receiving any bonus now. But given the company submitted an offer higher than the legal floor, workers could only take up that option after 30 days, which would put pressure on their personal finances.While the union says BHP hasn’t done enough during mediation and attached conditions to proposed benefits, the company is ratcheting up its own pressure to get a deal done.“We have gone to great lengths to reach an agreement during the process, and especially in mandatory mediation,” the company said in a text message late Friday. “We hope that these efforts will be appreciated by the workers because the offer in mediation will be the best that the company will present.”=======================================================================================Anything can happen but the two sides don't appear far apart.Union reps appear to be posturing a bit, and any strike will be short lived according to multiple parties. I found something from a Chilean news website El Mecurio late this afternoon while poking around today, that largely reiterated this Bloomberg article.As for production, production will still continue on a limited basis for up to 30 days at Escondida, largely from the oxide SX/EW circuits as well as the sulfide bio-leach pads. Leach typically represents about 20% of production at Escondida.Right now, BHP's Spence mine, which is right down the road road from Escondida, has spare heads who can operate Escondida's tankhouses in their SX/EW lines. Manning up the sulfide mining operation won't happen has too many employees would be required for such.Escondida has been producing about 85,000 metric tonnes of copper per month, and they'll keep about 90% capacity of the oxide/sulfide bio-leach lines rolling over a short time frame (30 days). So the impact of a 30 day strike at Escondida will be about 70,000 metric tonnes of copper.The world uses 25,000,000 metric tonnes of copper annually, so a 70k mt hit due to Escondida being down for 30 days would represent about 24 hours of output, lost.If people want copper, FCX has $1.6bb dollars (at cost) of product inventory sitting in warehouses as of June 30, and Codelco typically carries a similar amount of inventory. I'm sure both companies would be willing to part with some of their stock.Any pop to copper prices late next week if a strike occurs, will be short lived and tepid, and the expected loss of Escondida's output is only a day's worth of copper.China's State Resource Bureau (or whatever they call themselves now) will probably announce another release from strategic stockpiles next week anyway.Enjoy.Randall................can you even read Spanish ? Can you even spell it ?Drink well, old man.........Lol."

China sees the open door in Afghanistan...watch the belt and road weave all over that graveyard
On topic: 1/2 of Q3 was over before Cu drop. FCX averaged selling prices above 4.25 for this 1/2 of Q3. Even today it’s above 4 in the spot and futures are at 4.12. FCX sells at a mix of prices. So unless Cu goes below 3.75 today and stays there the rest of the Q it will be above $4.00. Won’t be 4.32 like last Q (if I remember the number correctly). But it won’t be bad either. One should only be concerned if trading/buying with margin.
"The market was angry today, my friends. It was not just FCX, every chart I look at waterfalls in the last hour.Jerome reared his ugly head, talk of tightening into what I see as a slowdown. Consumers are spooked. He will pop a lot of bubbles, bond, housing, comodities and stock market. Gold held it own even after the Fed dump, I took that as a promising sign for PMs. Fiscal needs to pour trillions more $ on this dumpster fire. JMHO"
"Seems like the Cu base is bottoming/holding @ $4.12? ... if so, that works for the FCX FCF, and SP, just fine"
Do you love it still holding on shorts patience is a virtue cheers
"From a paper written...the problem with copper supply...read itIt is extremely likely that over the coming years, copper supply growth will remain muted. There are new projects coming online, including Kamoa/Kakula in the DRC and the Oyu Tolgoi block-cave (once major geotechnical issues are resolved), however our modeling suggests these will likely serve to offset depletion from existing operations. Given the huge slowdown in discoveries, the weak reserve additions over the past decade, and the inability to add reserves by lowering the cut-off grade, it seems difficult to see how reserves and production can grow materially.The copper bull market is now underway. Investors are beginning to appreciate the demand story surrounding copper but most investors do not understand the complex issues now affecting supply. Between 2000 and 2020, high copper prices allowed compa- nies to grow their reserve basis even in the face of limited new copper discoveries. Because of increasing depletion issues, the lack of new world class mines coming online, and geological constraints embedded in copper porphyry deposits, our research tells us that copper supply will show little growth this decade. Strong demand is about to collide with severe copper supply problems. Copper prices are heading much, much higher"

I fear the market is at the point that good news will become bad news out of fear of the Fed raising rates or ending the taper.
"it's pretty clear that the FCX, for today more so than usual, is tied to even tiny pip movements in Cu ... it's very much like Highlowsel said earlier: a tight trading range ... it's like the machines expect a broader move North or South, and hence the alignment to the tight pip moves ... I dunno, thats just how I see it"
"A quick look at the copper chart shows yet another dive. Starting at about 06:45am it went from ~$4.36 and by 06:54 was at ~$4.3420. Small incremental movement, but for the commodity it was a big dive. Now at ~$4.3436. You know what to expect from FCX. PM bid $36.40. $37 was the last sessions resistant ceiling. I expect it to be so, at best, today. And probably for the remainder of the week. There's just nothing out there to make it go further north. Conversely, there's not much to make it truly dive back to recent lows. So it churns. That's the essence of the forecast for the week. Set traps and play it accordingly? Or take a break and go on vacation. Either way, G/L!"
"Copper will move back past 4.25 this week Copper and market having issues because of Covid/Delta Virus. Yes some slow down in Market but its mostly based on Covid.

"The usual commercial supplies of pure copper are used for the most critical of electrical applications such as the production of fine and superfine enamelled wires. It is essential that purity is reproducibly maintained in order to ensure high conductivity, consistent annealability and freedom from breaks during rod production and subsequent wire drawing. Since the applied enamel layers are thin but have to withstand voltage, they must have no surface flaws; consequently the basis copper wire must have an excellent surface quality. Primary copper of the best grade is used for producing the rod for this work. Uncontaminated recycled process scrap and other scrap that has been electrolytically refined back to grade 'A' quality may also be used."

"Copper took a big hit Today. US markets Drove Copper Down, Not Japan Not Europe Not China Yes I know a little weak news but not enough to move Copper down. Look for big Increase Overnight. Chile has 2 mines on Complete Strike, Las Bambas Roads are blocked NO Copper Shipments To Port and this looks to last for Several days. Copper did hit 4.10 Today Look for 4.20 Tomorrow. FCX Back Over 35 Tomorrow Job Numbers should be good as well."
"42,45&50 analyst's cover googl, amzn & FB....19 cover SO........ 11 analyst cover FCX...the street has no idea of the demand leverage from coming green wave or the limited global supply....... 11 analyst..... (let's be honest some of these 11 analyst think cu is only a cyclical play... no idea of coming secular growth wave) Jeffries & Goldman get it."
"Covid/Delta will start to peak by Monday get your shots save your own life and others. Gold 1,794 Copper 4.27 As soon as Feds and China stop playing games Copper will move up, look for 4.50 in Sept. Premarket 34.80 FCX 38.00 By First week of Sept, 45.00 by years end. Buy this stock while it's low this stock is a cash cow. When this happens FCX will find Love by Hedge Funds, Large Investment Groups again. Good bye to Shorts stay long and make the big bucks."
"Randall, I'm verifying your wake up call at $4.10..........copper. That still on ?Don't scud your pants, you bought puts again, to protect your downside, right, just like I told you ?Tell me you took my advice on that one.Trend is down, with FCX and copper getting rocked on the slightest informational misfortunes that the world economy coughs up, (and our fine media cares to report on........).It should be obvious that something isn't right w. FCX and copper.Just saying......"
"Just got in today, i think this is a future safe bet"
"From GSChinese headwinds are receding and demand in the rest of the world is robust, evidenced by premiums for physical copper in the US rising to five year highs.Goldman believes the copper market has now moved beyond Beijing’s attempts to cool prices and the impact of sales from the country’s strategic reserves – the “final tool for generating downward price pressure (short of slowing overall activity)” – in fact creates conditions for price rises down the line:“…with a finite amount of strategic reserves, policymakers are simply raising right tail price risks, particularly as we expect the bull market to be sustained on a multi-year basis implying a depletion risk on this stock source.”Besides, as Goldman points out, Beijing’s first batch of copper on auction of 50,000 tonnes amounts to just 36 hours of Chinese copper consumption."
"Fear is a bad thing. Looks as fear has took over for today. Won't last long Time to buy if you have dry powder. Market will rebound this week. But for now Copper 3.97 Gold 1,787. Ultra was correct on Copper But this drop not because of demand or usage, This is about fear will rebound soon. Just watch buy all the stock that drops today. If job numbers are good will rebound Copper north of 4.00 I'm long on FCX will buy more today at 32.50 if we drop that low."
The 3.5 trillion budget bill sets the financial cornerstone for clean energy technology and deployment.this will end up being the key reason the bill will pass…clean electrical energy or filthy fossil fuels that will end the world as we know it…this will be the political selling point
"Gold 1,788 Copper 4.25 FCX Premarket 34.85 Job Numbers out at 830 Fed news Coming Tomorrow. What will happen Just a guess not much. FCX not a lot of love at Hedge funds or Brokerage Houses. Need a strong upgrade or FCX to come with some Positive news, With this Management team not likely. Copper price I think moves back 4.30 Plus range soon. Machines and low Volume are the driver at this time, Can change with good news. If other Copper Miners strike in Chile would be a game changer."
"I think we see Copper over 4.10 Tomorrow. FCX Push 34 Two Chile Mines on strike, Others demanding huge bonus for past work and pay raise like Escondida. This will get very Interesting."
Pellalegosi is very skilled and she will get both bills passed.this will have a profound positive effect on fcx
"Copper did the first test of $4, broke it then bounced. Now at $4.0585. Gonna be one of those sessions. G/L! FCX bid $32.50."
31.5% down from the high look like continue to $28
"Chile Peso dropped over 1% on fear that BHP Escondida mine will strike, Las Bambas 3 Towns in Peru have road's blocked day 9 to stop ore transports. Copper down short term. Andy and Ultra states that Copper will free fall, I think different. Overnight Watch Copper move back up. FCX down today Mostly because of games played by Sells Squad. With Copper falling 8 Cents made it easier for them to drive stock down. Tomorrow will move back up."
"No doubt, the covid variants have set Global recovery back. Nations who seemed to control the original spread just postponed the inevitable. China and US seeing set backs. That said, I think the worst is past us. With the set backs, Nations are again realigned for a coordinated Global recovery. A guest on Bloomberg Friday broached the idea of a Coordinated Global Recovery, to my surprise."
It looks like Highlowsel gets the prize today FCX lock down at 37.00 is where machines have been set all day. Another day of low volume 10 Million shares traded with 1 hour 15 minutes left to trade. FCX 36.92. I thought we would break 37.50 Copper 4.37 going higher. Maybe Tomorrow volume will pick up.
"People who believe HYPER-INFLATION in the United States will be beneficial to copper prices, are fools.First of all, copper is prices in USD.So the debasement of the US dollar will not effect copper prices, expressed in USD, all things being equal.Second, China is the largest user of copper, and we import most of our durable (and non-durable) consumer goods from China. Were the USD to become virtually worthless, goods from China would be prohibitively expensive to American consumers (and thus unaffordable), The purchase of virtually anything made outside the United States would become unaffordable, irregardless the nature of the goods (or services).Thus, the US would not be the favored export market of the many (and various) foreign manufacturing-based economies like China.Thus, demand for manufacturing inputs in China would fall sharply, including demand for copper.Since the US would not be able to afford goods manufactured abroad, this, in turn, would squelch US economic activity, and crash the US economy. By extension, this would sharply decrease demand for copper.In a more micro sense, analyzing impacts of HYPER-INFLATION in the United States on domestic production, specifically domestic copper production:HYPER-INFLATION in the United States would cause labor costs in the United States to climb, visa vie labor costs in other foreign nations. Hence, mining costs of domestic copper producers would climb sharply visa vie the cost structure of foreign copper miners, thus making domestic producers un-competitive, relative to foreign producers. Miners are price takers, and copper would still be priced in USD. Eventually, an increasingly (and wildly) depreciated dollar would make foreign copper producers unprofitable as well, since the USD realized from the sale of foreign copper would bring insufficient local currency into company coffers to cover the foreign producers cost structure, thus making foreign producers unprofitable as well.HYPER-INFLATION in the United States would crater economic activity, destroy demand, and then eventually destroy the means of production in the US (and for the record, all modern economies).Foreign countries would attempt to avoid this by renouncing the US dollar, and pricing goods, and services in currencies other than the US dollar.It would not be conducive to higher profits for any copper miner, where ever based, and certainly not US producers.It's not a good thing, and people should not wish for it."
"Gold 1,817 Copper 4.32 Market green Someone or group trying to make sure FCX closes below 36.50 They are driving it backward Hope Buyers keeps it north of 36.50. Overall been a better day for FCX. Copper and FCX going up more next week. Ultra hope you jumped back on the train."
About mid quarter w coppa trading over 9500 on lme and say 4.25 in us. Gold took a header ...maybe offset by unhedged fuel costs. Seems like we’re on track for a decent but not blockbuster quarter. Cash flow will be UGE 
"Gold 1,805 Copper 4.22 Look for Copper to move past 4,25 Tomorrow. FCX 36 plus on the way to 38 this week. Hope you loaded up going long. Shorts will lose there shorts. Look for a huge volume day on FCX."
Everybody on the sidelines watching the Jerome show right now? He's got the focus of all media portals that's for sure. How many ways can he say nothing at all I wonder? Guess we'll find out...Bid $35.60..

"Not sure I have ever seen this type of Fed revolt. On taper, we now have , George, Kaplan , Bullard, Bostic and Harker saying come on, dude. Pretty open opposition to what we are likely to hear today!"
The move down today was unreal. Buy all you can we all know this will move back Quickly. Copper took a hit 4.30 will move back to 4.35 by Tomorrow. FCX 36.25 Should close north of 37.00 Today We all know Games are played stay strong The Copper and FCX Bulls will win. Market change soon.
Union at Caserones copper mine in Chile to strike after talks collapse-mining
"Another piece of the copper puzzle was made available yesterday, and seems like everyone missed it.Nobody's talking about it here.Figures."
"Sounds like the Variant is messing China up. Some might say sell, but I'll probably be buying and accumulating for another Global opening run."
Hey just my opinion what do you think about Friday? Should we buy FCX before or after the chairman speaks on interest rates￼
"Will more Covid Red Death 2.0 help copper prices......?Or hurt copper prices......?Or will it's fearful reemergence merely expose the fraud underlying ""The 2021 Copper Story""............?Golden Saps will tell us."
"The Dollar has went nuts to the high side 93.088 Driving Gold down 1,782 Copper 4.22 will move higher today Dow down over 300 points. FCX 34.72 Never thought we would see this low today.What a gift to buy in at.Take advantage of this price will move back up today."
Interesting little piece of perversity going on. Copper now at $4.1577 yet FCX bid spikes to the $34.40 area. Hmmmm......? Can it last I wonder? Something will have to give/ Dow also off over 130pts at this writing.....
99.5% Of Union Members voted to reject offer from BHP and Strike at Escondida Mine in Chile. BHP will take the 5 Days to negotiate new 3 year contract that law allows. The Union and BHP are a long way apart. Look for Copper and FCX to go up on Monday. Road blocks at Las Bambas Mine in Peru 3 towns have blocked roads to stop Shipments of Copper this started 8 days ago. Copper should find it's way back to the 4.60 range Look for FCX to move back over 40.00 This Week. Hope all loaded up last week. No more 3.00 Motels or 30.00 stock price for FCX.

Look for FCX to move back over 37 soon and keep going Higher.
"I wrote this post for another site. It includes passages that were part of replies to various posts on this site. I would like to see what copper investors think and why. (For the record, I have investments in both copper and fossil fuels.) Opinion -- Too many people seem to be accepting the “science” that global warming is 100% caused by man’s burning of fossil fuels. I don’t have answers but I think all of us should have questions.The first question is why all these US climate issues are peaking now, while man-made air pollution was much higher several decades ago. There are several sites that report continuous improvement in US air quality. The following is from the EPA.“Air Quality Trends Show Clean Air ProgressNationally, concentrations of air pollutants have dropped significantly since 1990:Carbon Monoxide (CO) 8-Hour, 78%Lead (Pb) 3-Month Average, 85% (from 2010)Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Annual, 59%Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) 1-Hour, 51%Ozone (O3) 8-Hour, 25%Particulate Matter 10 microns (PM10) 24-Hour, 46%Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) Annual, 43% (from 2000)Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) 24-Hour, 44% (from 2000)Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) 1-Hour, 90%Numerous air toxics have declined with percentages varying by pollutantDuring this same period, the U.S. economy continued to grow, Americans drove more miles, and population and energy use increased.”The second question should be about the possibility of alternative explanations. The ""science"" says the sun is growing larger and brighter and will envelope the earth in 5 billion years. Solar flares and sunspots, the heat generated from the sun, the tilt of the earth, and the distance of the earth from the sun, are all assumed to be constant. Yet the ""science"" says the sun is quite active. Again, I don’t know the answer. I just have the questions.The final question is to what extent does the US contribute to the global level of carbon dioxide. Do we make a real difference? The US emitted 5.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2018, making up 15% of the world’s emissions. This will be significantly lower in the past two years for reasons related to the pandemic. The Chinese have recently gone back to burning coal. Only Europe seems committed to cutting CO2 emissions. Each of you can evaluate the commitment of your home state."
"Sold all my 17,000 shares great profit￼"
In on the last drop south of the 61.8 Fib line. Now riding it with a trailing with bid at .85. Volume remains light and it looks like they're having to work the action. Small print stuff keeps running across the last sales....1 share...5 shares...25 shares...that sort of thing. Not necessary surprising. It's August....and most all the big boys/girls are most likely in the Hamptons. Unlike Amanda who's probably down on the Shore.  (and there I went and done it. Get ready for a set of squawking....)Bid $35.88.
"the range so far today (after the initial drop) is a tight $36.13 - $37.05, a narrow spread of 2.5% ... so no strength in either direction after the initial hit ... the China economic stats are being interpreted as weak/missed, which when you consider COVID, trade war talk, etc, the stats were pretty-good, definitely still growing over there ... watch CNBC tonight on China markets, if another sell-off (HS been weak for a few months) occurs, then I could see FCX settling into a ""temporary"" lower channel by eow, maybe $33 - $34 ... I say ""temporary"" as the Cu > FCX cashflows will be exceptional in Q3, and FCX could re-take the $40 high-ground in Sept ... JMHO"
Hammer down it down …I’ll buy it back￼
I feel like we’re back in our cozy spot w coppa over 4.3...it’s all about high average price over long periods of time Good weekend

In what world does Roku sport a market cap above FCX? Apparently in this one…400+PE…while FCX is just above 10 on forward earnings…
Unrelated to FCX but Charlie Watts has passed on to the next life at 80 yrs old. RIP.

"COPX: Bearish Forces Mount Against Copper As China's Demand SlowsSeeking AlphaHarrison SchwartzAug. 19, 2021 3:55 AM ETGlobal X Copper Miners ETF (COPX)Excerpts:As China's Demand Slows, Copper May Crash: Copper has been unable to remain above $4.5/lbs for most of the past two decades. It reached this level before the 2008 crash and again in 2011 during the recovery. However, when copper prices get that level, it seems that mining companies look to grow capacity, and buyers reduce purchases, causing the metal to drop back to the $2-$3 range. The metal temporarily reached above this crucial level early this year but has declined since China's imports have dropped by at least 35% since last year.China consumes over half of the world's annual copper production, used for building construction and infrastructure. Its huge construction sector partly fuels its economy, its go-to government cure for economic slowdowns. Problematically, the Chinese government has used this lever so aggressively over the past two decades that over a fifth of homes are vacant. By any standard measure, the country has the world's most extreme property bubble and has built far more buildings and infrastructure than it will use anytime soon. This has led to colossal debt buildups in China's developers and growing bankruptcy risks.The Chinese government has indeed doubled down on the issue of its construction sector time and time again. Indeed, considering the country's government has far more economic control than a western government, they may manage to prolong this potential crisis indefinitely. Even still, China's home prices are not rising at the pace they used to, and it seems unreasonable to assume they will build more ghost cities ad Infinitum. Ghost cities are a significant source of the global copper demand, so an end to their development will likely lead to many years of depressed copper demand.While China's property market is an important long-term issue, a growing number of short-term factors may impair copper prices. Most notably, evidence of a cyclical peak in U.S manufacturing and retail demand as well as the recent drop in U.S construction and the collapse in vehicle sales. Overall, nearly all of the demand-side factors which benefited copper last year all appear to be in reversal just as copper production rises above pre-COVID levels, indicating high potential for a short-term glut.========================================================================================This guys is spot on, discussing China's ailing property construction sector and it's coming effects on China copper demand from it's slowdown.A slowdown that is being lead by China's gov't in effort to shore up rotting banking sector."
Any effect of Jackson Hole going virtual on markets? Maybe gives the Fed a pause? Things are still not normal.

Thanks for the $2580 today Ultra! I’m going to pay my caddies $90 instead of $80 this month.
"Gold having a ruff day 1,763 Copper settled back down it's Friday 4.34. If Escondida strikes over weekend Monday Copper over 4.50 If Senate passes Info Bill Higher than than still looking for 40 if all happens next week. FCX 36.90 How close to 37 at closing ? I think Over."
I love how people doubt the copper market. All it takes is a flood or a strike to take production off line
3.5 Trillion stimulus drives CU prices higher TWO reasons!! 1. Actual demand for green projects. 2. Trillions in spending paid for by borrowing/printing DEVALUES the dollar pushes metal prices higher. Majority of public/analysts/investors don't understand how a falling currency can drive commodity value.

"OT, While conversation is often dominated by electric cars and the need to abolish the use of fossil fuels, the US government -- and the very blue state of New Jersey -- appear currently more concerned about reducing gasoline prices. I found these news items interesting.- The president's call for OPEC to increase oil production for the purpose of lowering fuel prices- The auction of 20 million barrels of crude from Strategic Oil Reserve to lower fuel prices - The EPA's current plan to recommend 2021 biofuel blending mandates lower than in 2020,- New Jersey reducing gasoline taxes by 8.3 cents per gallon starting October 1.I understand that the US is not ready to move away from internal combustion engines. I think these moves are prudent, if not more for approval polls than for the common good. I'm certainly not complaining."
Hmmm...interesting action by the machines. In PM the bid goes to the 38.2% Fib retracement line. Bell rings and they take it directly south to the 50% line. Then bounce it to where it now sits; squarely in-between those two lines. I guess they're trying to decide which way to go from here? Do machines have minds like that I wonder? Bid $36.95. Copper at $4.3720.
"FCX -- 2Q21 EBITDA In Line; Strong Cash Flow Generation -- Morgan Stanley, July 22, 2021 Equal weight; Industry attractive; Price Target $38.002Q21 Highlights: Adjusted EBITDA of $2,678m was basically in line with our $2,694m estimate and consensus of $2,670m. Relative to our model, lower revenues were mostly offset by lower costs. Adj. EPS of $0.77 was slightly above consensus of $0.76, but in line with the $0.77 we had in our model.Key takeaways: i) Cash from operations of $2,396m in 2Q21 was well above MSe of $1,774m; ii) 2Q21 copper sales volume was 929m lbs vs. MSe 975m lbs / guidance of 975m lbs (copper production volume was 913m lbs); iii) Gold sales volume was 305k oz, 8% lower than MSe of 330k oz / guidance of 330k oz (gold production volume was 305k oz); iii) Copper net cash costs were $1.48/lb, but included $0.07/lb non-recurring costs associated with labor-related charges at Cerro Verde – adjusting for that, net cash costs were in line with MSe of $1.41/lb and slightly better than guidance of $1.42/lb; iv) The company expects capex of ~$2.2b in 2021, including $1.4b for major projects, vs MSe of $2.6b (with an estimated $300m for the Indonesian smelter, not included in the company's guidance).Outlook: FCX expects consolidated sales in 3Q21 at 1.035b lbs of copper (vs. MSe 1.005b lbs), 360k oz of gold (vs. MSe 370k oz), and 21m lbs of molybdenum (vs. MSe 21m lbs). Management guided to 3Q21 net cash costs of $1.33/lb, vs MSe of $1.19/lb. For the full year, consolidated sales increased slightly to 3.85b lbs of copper vs. 3.8b lbs previously MSe of 3.85b lbs copper, see Exhibit 1. The company expects FY2021 net unit cash costs to average $1.35/lb vs. MSe of $1.30/lb; guidance assumes gold prices of $1,800/oz and molybdenum of $16.00/lb for the remainder of 2021, vs. Morgan Stanley's deck of $1,785/oz and $15.00/lb."
"With what's going on with copper, and the Dow being off (now) over 270pts, there seems little to no reason to play from the buy side. But on the sell side....well....it's a party so long as you time it well? Bid now $35.88."
"Stimulus, Strikes, Ghost Buyout Fantasies, whatever but today is shaping up to be a big day for the stock to move higher big time. And with the general market supporting overall higher prices and new cash coming in. FCX looks like the ideal place to park some money for the big boys."
Just got a call back from David Joint from FCX VP Investor Relations. He thought the Conference call was very good and showed a great outlook on the company Moving forward. I told him wasn't unhappy with FCX profits or the company is run. My compliant was the way no plan was laid out to investors. Of course he disagreed. He said the board would be meeting in Jan for cash back to stock holders. Also let him know that with honey with what's good about FCX would have raised stock price at least 3.00 just my thoughts. Over all not a lot out of call of course David backed FCX 100% which I would expected..
"Iron ore price dives 13% on Fed, Chinese growth worriesMININGStaff WriterAugust 19, 2021 | 9:04 amIntelligence Markets China USA Iron Ore Excerpt:Iron ore prices sank to an eight-month low on Thursday in the wake of concerns stretching from China’s economy, covid-19 and the tapering of Federal Reserve stimulus.China’s steel consumption is expected to soften in the second half, especially in the construction sector, due to tightening property policy, the country’s steel association and analysts said.“Policymakers are clearly concerned about over-investment and concentrated credit risk in the property sector,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia wrote in an emailed note.“Even if China swings to more pro-growth policies to battle recent weakness, there’s a good chance that the property sector is left out.”=======================================================================================Iron ore has collapsed to levels seen last December 2020.Copper on it's way there as well. Parallel path to be traveled as with iron oreChina's property sector is being slowed by the gov't of China, and it will have big knock-on effect for copper, since copper usage in China is inextricably linked to steel usage for property development.Less property development, less steel, less copper consumption.Pretty simple, really."

Copper Starting to recover 4.29 Will be good when Escondida goes on Strike well at least I hope they do. Should move Copper back to around 4.50 FCX 36.40 Should go Green today. Look to move over 37.

"Peruvian copper miner Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde said on Friday in a securities filing that it had paid “under protest” a tax debt of 1 billion soles ($245.52 million), as the amount continues to be the subject of an arbitration dispute.Thats 0,17 cents a share…."
"I thought that the FCX Q2 results could best be described as “pedestrian"", compelling few to sell the stock and few to buy. Profits were strong on a comparative basis but fully attributable to high commodity prices. Thus, higher profits were fully anticipated.Copper production on a quarter-to-quarter basis -- other than Grasburg – was disappointing, causing some concern as to post 2022 revenues. It is my experience that debt reduction does little for the stock price of healthy companies. The implication is that management could have found better uses for the money. Weak companies with stability concerns get a much bigger bang for reducing debt levels.Management's reluctance to “consider” the return of cash to stockholders, in whatever form, (consideration now scheduled for April 2022) is consistent with FCX culture. One has to wonder if they are building a cash war chest for some other reason: concerns about the rest of 2021 or, more likely, some possible or pending opportunity to increase revenue.If they go big, spending cash and acquiring more debt, talk of dividends/stock buybacks will cease, but revenue growth may energize the stock price.The other side of the spectrum has FCX being acquired. Whenever I listen to an Adkerson presentation, I think about that as a possibility."
"I am not a disciple of TA but just watching the action yesterday and today FCX looks like it wants to go higher. And then the question is why? Stimulus and Infrastructure; Strikes; Rotation. Meanwhile more confounding is flat Cu prices with FCX trending higher. I know one of you have the right answer, but which one!"
"China’s Industrial Slowdown Could Kill The Commodity RallyOil PriceBy Tsvetana ParaskovaAug 04, 2021, 4:00 PM CDTExcerpts:One of the biggest drivers of the surge in metals prices this year, the world’s top commodity consumer China, is showing signs of a slowdown in demand, which could drag down copper and iron ore prices for the rest of the year after a blistering rally in the first half. Chinese factory activity growth slowed down to the smallest in 15 months, imports of copper and iron ore are also slowing down amid surging prices and curbs in China’s steel manufacturing, while authorities are releasing metals stocks from reserves to cool rallying prices which raise manufacturing costs. All these factors from the past few weeks are bearish for the Chinese demand—and as a result, imports—of metals such as iron ore, copper, zinc, and aluminum, Reuters columnist Clyde Russell notes. Although analysts say that slower Chinese demand doesn’t necessarily mean lower commodity prices, because of tight global markets, China may not be a key driver of metals demand through the end of 2021. That’s because of slowing factory growth, authority-mandated caps on steel manufacturing, and the release of tons of metals from China’s reserves. China’s copper imports have also slowed down in recent months, customs data shows. But copper scrap imports have been surging, doubling in the first half of 2021, according to metals intelligence firm Roskill. As manufacturers replace the more expensive refined copper with scrap, “This would unquestionable result in a decline in Chinese refined consumption in 2021- a hugely negative factor for world copper prices to surmount, despite the evident recovery in demand in the Rest of World,” Roskill said last week.“Watch out copper. A great wall of scrap is still heading in China’s direction,” the intelligence firm said. Copper prices could also drop because of Chinese sales of tons of metals, including copper, from state reserves. “Chinese policymakers are committed to curbing any excessive gains in commodity prices, which may deter some financial investors from re-entering the market, especially considering the uncertainties in the broader market as the Fed moves to taper asset purchases,” Wenyu Yao, Senior Commodities Strategist at ING, wrote in a July 20 note. For copper prices, “[W]e may end up drifting around somewhat blindly this summer before further downside risks emerge in late 3Q21 and 4Q,” Yao added. Demand across most commodities in China is expected to slow down in the second half of 2021, Wood Mackenzie said in a new monthly China Economic Focus report last week. “China’s economy is expected to slow down in H2 2021. Slower export growth, rising commodity prices, lacklustre infrastructure investment and expiring subsidies will all drag down the country’s GDP growth. As a result, we should see a deceleration of commodities demand in China,” Wood Mackenzie senior economist Yanting Zhou said.========================================================================================Quick, someone talk about all the electric cars that will be plying the roads in 2030...................!!!!!!!Goldman Sachs.............!!!!!!!!And someone tell the snowflake maharaja that Chinese copper metal imports are going to be collapsing in July, (as continued confirmation that the world's largest user has enough copper to supply it's needs).I think he's done tucked his head in the sand because he can't handle an opinion that differs from his own little fantasy world the guy lives in.Pity that."

Oh no Copper just hit 4.40
"Udokan Copper Completes Installation of Coarse Ore CrusherYahoo FinanceWed, August 11, 2021, 11:00 AMExcerpts:MOSCOW, Aug. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Udokan Copper – the company that develops one of the largest copper deposits in the world, located in the Far East of Russia, and is currently building a mining and metallurgical plant (MMP) - has completed the installation of а gyratory crusher at its coarse crushing plant. The ThyssenKrupp crusher will process rougher ore fractions supplied from Zapadniy open pit.Udokan Copper was established to develop Russia's largest untapped deposit and one of the global Top-3 - Udokan. The Company is part of USM Group founded by Alisher B. Usmanov.The deposit reserves are 26.7 mt according to JORC, with average copper grade of 1.05%. Udokan is located in the Zabaikalye Region in the Far East of Russia, 30 km away from the Baikal-Amur mainline.The first stage of the Udokan plant shall provide total output of 125,000 tpa of copper in cathodes and sulphide concentrate, its processing capacity being 12 mtpa of ore. The second stage currently under feasibility study implies processing additionally of 24 mtpa.========================================================================================USM will complete this mine and start it up next year (2022). And they're looking at doubling the processing capacity by 2026.This is the second big new copper mine to coming out of Russia in the 2021-2022 period.RCC's, Tominskoye copper mine, started up this spring and is ramping up to capacity. At full capacity, it will produce about 180,000 mt. per annum.Tominskoye, Udokan............just two of the more than two dozen sizable new copper mines worldwide, coming into production by 2023.Lots of new copper coming to a smelter near you, ladies.......Lots. Over 5mm mt of new annual mine supply hits market by 2025. It's a 25% boost in mined copper supply. Enjoy."

Mr. Hill returned to Dallas, where he worked at the airport and tried to avoid being identified by fans.“I had a short beard, regular length, and if you take off the hat and shades and wear work clothes and put ‘Joe’ on my work shirt, people are not expecting to see you,” he said in a 2019 interview. “Now, a couple of times, a couple of people did ask me, and I just lied, and I said: ‘No!

BHP Just sold there Oil and Gas Look out FCX buy out. Thoughts ?
"Another great dialog sports fans. No surprises here for me. Demand should be down due to covid impacts. Hopefully the world will recover from that debacle soon. As for the increase supply that Ultra has pointed out so well....... I'm not as concerned as him. Its happened most every cycle change, and the extra supply is usually offset by less salvage copper contribution as the price temporarily lowers. One issue I haven't heard comment on lately is we are now in one of the two ""seasonal"" times per year when copper prices historically decline. Historically speaking, you buy the miners in the August/September time frame, and then sell in the February/March period if you are a swing trader. The key debate in my mind is where copper prices bottom this cycle. Ultra could be close on his prediction....... or he could be way off........ since we now live in a different world managed by much different leadership. Either way, FCX should remain a fantastic trading stock to profit from if investor timing is wisely chosen."

"Kamoa-Kakula achieves commercial production milestoneMININGBy Henry LazenbyAugust 3, 2021 11:38 am Markets Africa Copper Excerpts:Africa-focused megaproject developer Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN) has declared commercial production at the first phase of the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, effective from July 1, the company announced this week.Ivanhoe said Tuesday the 3.8 million-tonne-per-annum concentrator plant was deemed to have reached commercial production after achieving more than 80% of design capacity, with recoveries tracking close to 70% for a continuous, seven-day period.Copper output has steadily increased since hot commissioning began at the end of May, exceeding 500 tonnes per day towards the end of July and nearing the Phase 1 steady-state design capacity of about 550 tonnes per day, or 200,000 tonnes per year.Ivanhoe said copper recoveries increased from an average of about 70% in June to about 81% in July. During the last ten days of July, the concentrator averaged copper recoveries close to 82%, with operations reportedly progressively increasing toward the Phase 1 steady-state design parameters, including recoveries at about 86%.Kamoa-Kaula mined 414,000 tonnes grading 5.16% copper in July, comprising 367,000 tonnes grading 5.29% copper from Kakula, including 85,000 tonnes grading 7.70% copper from the mine’s high-grade centre, and 47,000 tonnes grading 4.13% copper from the Kansoko mine.The company has guided for 2021 output of 80,000 to 95,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate, on a 100% basis.Kakula is one of the world’s highest-grade major new copper mines, and the most significant new mine to come into production since Escondida in Chile in November 1990.The forthcoming phased expansion of the project to 19 million tonnes per annum would solidify its position as the world’s second-largest copper mining complex, with peak annual copper output of more than 800,000 tonnes.=======================================================================================Achieved commercial production very quickly. With that high grade ore, lot of room for error, and a small initial mine footprint.By 2023, their Phase 2 concentrator will be complete and by 2024, combined output from it (and Phase 1, already operational) will produce between 400-500k mt. new copper.Virtually all of it will go to China as blister.Lots of new copper supply coming in 2021-2023, boys and girls.......at a time when China has a copper stomach ache."

"To be clear, the $1.3 trillion infrastructure bill includes $550 in new spending programs, including roads, bridges, airports, rail service etc. It would also renew existing infrastructure and transportation programs set to expire at the end of September. This bill was approved in the Senate and should be easily approved in the House. It should have a positive impact on the price of copper.The $3.5 trillion social spending bill has not yet been written. The House narrowly passed a budget resolution and framework that allows the House (as the Senate) to approve the yet undrafted bill with a simple majority. The framework calls for a $3.5 trillion on spending for climate initiatives, paid leave, childcare, education and health care. The impact of this bill on the price of copper is likely to be negative, as higher corporate taxes are assumed to be included.The Speaker originally refused to advance the infrastructure bill until the social spending bill passed both houses. However 8-9 moderate House Democrats forced her concession to put the infrastructure bill to a vote by a September 27 deadline. I doubt that House Progressive Democrats and House Moderate Democrats will quickly agree as to which programs and taxes will be included in the social spending bill. This should mean that the $1.3 trillion infrastructure bill will pass both houses and be signed into law in October. (Optimistic but again, good for copper)However, If the House does manage to pass a fairly unpopular social spending bill by September 27, passage (under the budget reconciliation process) will require no Republican votes in either house -- assuming all Democrats Senators plus VP vote ""yes"". There are two Democratic senators (Manchin and Sinema) who have threatened to block passage. There may be more once the bill is written. There is also an issue with the debt ceiling that the Democrats did not address in their maneuvers. There will certainly need to be some deal making. Stay tuned. #FCX"

"Column: Funds unimpressed by mounting copper supply disruptionReutersBy Andy HomeCommodity NewsAUGUST 16, 202110:50 AMExcerpts:LONDON (Reuters) - Two Chilean copper mines have been hit by strike action over the last week and a Canadian one has just been suspended due to wildfires.The copper supply hits are mounting up, but you wouldn’t know it from the price action.The lack of excitement reflects a dearth of speculative interest in copper right now, with fund positioning low on the LME, the CME and the Shanghai markets.Macro headwinds in the form of slowing growth impetus in China and the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 are currently outweighing copper’s micro dynamics in investor minds.FUNDS TAKE A HOLIDAY:Fund managers have collectively taken something of a holiday break on copper.LME broker Marex Spectron estimates the net speculative long on the London market was 4.3% of open interest as of last Thursday - a one-year low. The collective bull bet reached 62% of open interest back in February, when copper was charging up through the $9,000-per-tonne level.Funds remain net long of the CME copper contract but the commitment is weak by historical standards, amounting to 31,965 contracts.That’s slightly up on June’s one-year low of 19,266 contracts, but a long way off the February peak of 87,671 when bull spirits were rampant.It’s noticeable that funds started rebuilding outright short positions on the CME contract after the dilution of the short squeeze on the September-December time-spread at the end of July.Investors everywhere seem decidedly unconvinced that copper is going to revisit June’s record nominal high of $10,747.50 per tonne any time soon.DEMAND HEADWINDSWhen it comes to copper, the investment proxy for global growth, fund managers are still taking their cue from China, where a stimulus-fuelled recovery is fading.Industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail figures out on Monday all came in below expectations, adding to nervousness about the potential spread of the Delta variant within the country.China’s refined copper imports fell for the fourth straight month in July, adding to the sense of lost momentum, although the greater availability of scrap metal is an important hidden factor behind the headlines.Meanwhile, the green infrastructure boost in the rest of the world is still pending.The U.S. Infrastructure Bill’s $1 trillion focus on upgrading transport systems and homes could boost the country’s copper demand by 3%, or 80,000 tonnes per year, over a five-year period, according to research house CRU. (“The American infrastructure plan - what does it mean for metals demand?”, Aug 12, 2021)But the bill hasn’t yet passed and until it does, there won’t be any tangible traction on physical market dynamics.=======================================================================================Commodity funds paring copper bets, and moving in the direction of being outright short.China's economy stalling out.China's appetite for copper crashing. Big copper tummy ache in China for copper.Tepid copper demand expected to be created by 'Infrastructure Boondoggle' - 80k incremental annual demand is nothing but a joke, folks.Things are not looking up for copper.Caserones and Andina won't be striking for more than 30-45 days, and Highland Valley will be offline for a week, maybe two over forest fires in southern BC.No wonder nobody is worried about this purported 'supply hit'."
33's running after hrs...just sayin. this institutional selling can be scary over last few days.Im not convinced the inflation story is stable..I believe it ramps in the coming months.what do you think happens to copper price. You see..what many dont understand...uhmm Ultra..is that you can have growth slowdown and creeping higher prices..they aren't necessarily correlated..that is growth and inflation. good luck..im long a fair amount from 34's
Solid Closing for FCX sets up for a nice run upward next week. Look for FCX to move past 40 next week along with Copper prices moving higher. Have A good weekend.

"Chile’s Codelco, the world’s largest copper miner, increased its production by 14.9% year-on-year to 151,600 tonnes in June, and by 6.8% so far this year, the Chilean state copper commission Cochilco said on Tuesday.BHP’s Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, saw production fall 21.6% year-on-year to 82,900 tonnes in the same month, for an accumulated drop of 14.9% in the first half of this year.SIGN UP FOR THE COPPER DIGESTSign UpEscondida has curtailed some operations since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and imposition of restrictions, including reducing cathode production, resulting in 11 straight months of declining production.Meanwhile at the Collahuasi copper mine — a joint venture by Glencore and Anglo American — production fell 6.7% year-on-year to 53,900 tonnes in June, giving an accumulated increase of 2.7% in the first six months of the year.The country’s total production was up 2.3% year-on-year in June to 477,300 tonnes, Cochilco said.(By Fabian Cambero and Aislinn Laing; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and David Holmes)"
