Hey just my opinion what do you think about Friday? Should we buy FCX before or after the chairman speaks on interest rates￼
Look for FCX to move back over 37 soon and keep going Higher.
Please give your best estimates for this quarters special dividend.refer to special dividend policy reiterated at last conference call
"Copper at $4.3720 looks like it wants to go back to the .40 line or north of it. Again.PM FCX bid $37.14. I hope others' have been makin' the monies off the upsie downsie sine wave action of the bid over the last few weeks. It's done a few round trips from ~$34 to ~$38 hasn't it? Pull up a 180 day chart and you can see it. And having been lucky in the placement of traps and such, ostensibly playing off the gamble that the pattern will continue, I've done nicely. I can't complain as it's keeping the frig well stocked. Now let's see how this week plays out. G/L"

"Commodity Prices Should Bounce Back. A Few Stocks to Play the Rebound.Barron’s, Andrew Barry Aug. 27, 2021 Commodity producers look appealing after a pullback from May highs. While prices for industrial metals like copper and iron ore have been weaker, Chris LaFemina, a mining analyst at Jefferies, is upbeat on the sector. “The soft patch will end,” he says. “There won’t be a massive acceleration in demand, but things will start to pick up, and there are supply constraints in commodities like copper that will result in demand growing faster than supply.”Among diversified miners, BHP (ticker: BHP), at $66, is down 20% from its peak; Rio Tinto (RIO) is off 19%, to $75; Anglo American (NGLOY) is off 13%, to $21; and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), a global copper producer, is down 21% from its peak to $36.LaFemina is most enamored of Freeport—and copper.Copper prices, down about 10% from their spring peak, to $4.33 a pound, have held up better than iron ore, which is off 40% from its high, to $145 a ton. BHP, Rio Tinto, and Anglo American have significant exposure to iron ore.LaFemina likes the copper story in part because of the rise of renewable power—wind turbines require a considerable amount of copper—and of electric vehicles, which use four times the copper of cars with internal combustion engines. Barron’s highlighted the “green economy” demand for the metal in a cover story earlier this year.· Freeport now trades for 10 times projected 2022 earnings of $3.50 a share and yields under 1%. Now that Freeport’s net debt has shrunk to a target of $3.4 billion, dividends and buybacks should ramp up in 2022.“Freeport is leveraged to copper, has low costs, and is growing volumes,” LaFemina says. “The capital return story is just beginning.” He has a $60 price target on the stock and an above-consensus 2022 earnings estimate of more than $6 a share, assuming copper prices at $5.50 a pound.LaFemina is also partial to BHP, Rio Tinto, and Anglo American, noting that they have single-digit price/earnings ratios and high dividends. BHP and Rio Tinto now yield 9%, although their dividends are irregular."
"US Debt = $28.65 Trillion.When GWB left office, it was only $10.6 trillion.Only........Lol.Pretty scr*wed the US will be, soon enough.We'll have to sell California."
Hmmm...interesting action by the machines. In PM the bid goes to the 38.2% Fib retracement line. Bell rings and they take it directly south to the 50% line. Then bounce it to where it now sits; squarely in-between those two lines. I guess they're trying to decide which way to go from here? Do machines have minds like that I wonder? Bid $36.95. Copper at $4.3720.
OMG. Rivian raised additional 10 billion today now has 80 Billion valuation...they are pre revenue. They haven’t booked any revenue to date! FCX is going to 100
"Another great dialog sports fans. No surprises here for me. Demand should be down due to covid impacts. Hopefully the world will recover from that debacle soon. As for the increase supply that Ultra has pointed out so well....... I'm not as concerned as him. Its happened most every cycle change, and the extra supply is usually offset by less salvage copper contribution as the price temporarily lowers. One issue I haven't heard comment on lately is we are now in one of the two ""seasonal"" times per year when copper prices historically decline. Historically speaking, you buy the miners in the August/September time frame, and then sell in the February/March period if you are a swing trader. The key debate in my mind is where copper prices bottom this cycle. Ultra could be close on his prediction....... or he could be way off........ since we now live in a different world managed by much different leadership. Either way, FCX should remain a fantastic trading stock to profit from if investor timing is wisely chosen."

"ICSG posted May data on the state of the copper market on Friday. Every 20th of the month, ladies. Get with the program.""Preliminary data indicates that world copper mine production increased by 4.8% over the first five months of 2021, with concentrate production increasing by around 6.5% and solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) declining by about 2%:"">World mine production started to recover in June 2020 as lockdown measures easedand the industry adapted to stricter health protocols. However, government-imposedrestrictions related to COVID-19 and preventative measures implemented by theindustry to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 continue to constrain output in a fewcountries this year.>Production in Chile, the world’s biggest copper mine producing country, was down by2% in the first 5 months of this year with a 2% growth in concentrate production beingmore than offset by a 13% decline in SX-EW output.>Output in Peru, the world’s second biggest copper mine producing country, increasedby 17% mainly because March-May production was up by 35% from a constrained March-May 2020 basis when the industry was severely impacted by the COVID-19 related country lockdown. However, Jan-May 2021 production is still 7% below that of Jan-May 2019.Fun news."
at some point the market is going to have to give fcx the $4 copper points back..

It looks like Highlowsel gets the prize today FCX lock down at 37.00 is where machines have been set all day. Another day of low volume 10 Million shares traded with 1 hour 15 minutes left to trade. FCX 36.92. I thought we would break 37.50 Copper 4.37 going higher. Maybe Tomorrow volume will pick up.
"Column: Funds unimpressed by mounting copper supply disruptionReutersBy Andy HomeCommodity NewsAUGUST 16, 202110:50 AMExcerpts:LONDON (Reuters) - Two Chilean copper mines have been hit by strike action over the last week and a Canadian one has just been suspended due to wildfires.The copper supply hits are mounting up, but you wouldn’t know it from the price action.The lack of excitement reflects a dearth of speculative interest in copper right now, with fund positioning low on the LME, the CME and the Shanghai markets.Macro headwinds in the form of slowing growth impetus in China and the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 are currently outweighing copper’s micro dynamics in investor minds.FUNDS TAKE A HOLIDAY:Fund managers have collectively taken something of a holiday break on copper.LME broker Marex Spectron estimates the net speculative long on the London market was 4.3% of open interest as of last Thursday - a one-year low. The collective bull bet reached 62% of open interest back in February, when copper was charging up through the $9,000-per-tonne level.Funds remain net long of the CME copper contract but the commitment is weak by historical standards, amounting to 31,965 contracts.That’s slightly up on June’s one-year low of 19,266 contracts, but a long way off the February peak of 87,671 when bull spirits were rampant.It’s noticeable that funds started rebuilding outright short positions on the CME contract after the dilution of the short squeeze on the September-December time-spread at the end of July.Investors everywhere seem decidedly unconvinced that copper is going to revisit June’s record nominal high of $10,747.50 per tonne any time soon.DEMAND HEADWINDSWhen it comes to copper, the investment proxy for global growth, fund managers are still taking their cue from China, where a stimulus-fuelled recovery is fading.Industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail figures out on Monday all came in below expectations, adding to nervousness about the potential spread of the Delta variant within the country.China’s refined copper imports fell for the fourth straight month in July, adding to the sense of lost momentum, although the greater availability of scrap metal is an important hidden factor behind the headlines.Meanwhile, the green infrastructure boost in the rest of the world is still pending.The U.S. Infrastructure Bill’s $1 trillion focus on upgrading transport systems and homes could boost the country’s copper demand by 3%, or 80,000 tonnes per year, over a five-year period, according to research house CRU. (“The American infrastructure plan - what does it mean for metals demand?”, Aug 12, 2021)But the bill hasn’t yet passed and until it does, there won’t be any tangible traction on physical market dynamics.=======================================================================================Commodity funds paring copper bets, and moving in the direction of being outright short.China's economy stalling out.China's appetite for copper crashing. Big copper tummy ache in China for copper.Tepid copper demand expected to be created by 'Infrastructure Boondoggle' - 80k incremental annual demand is nothing but a joke, folks.Things are not looking up for copper.Caserones and Andina won't be striking for more than 30-45 days, and Highland Valley will be offline for a week, maybe two over forest fires in southern BC.No wonder nobody is worried about this purported 'supply hit'."

"I wrote this post for another site. It includes passages that were part of replies to various posts on this site. I would like to see what copper investors think and why. (For the record, I have investments in both copper and fossil fuels.) Opinion -- Too many people seem to be accepting the “science” that global warming is 100% caused by man’s burning of fossil fuels. I don’t have answers but I think all of us should have questions.The first question is why all these US climate issues are peaking now, while man-made air pollution was much higher several decades ago. There are several sites that report continuous improvement in US air quality. The following is from the EPA.“Air Quality Trends Show Clean Air ProgressNationally, concentrations of air pollutants have dropped significantly since 1990:Carbon Monoxide (CO) 8-Hour, 78%Lead (Pb) 3-Month Average, 85% (from 2010)Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Annual, 59%Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) 1-Hour, 51%Ozone (O3) 8-Hour, 25%Particulate Matter 10 microns (PM10) 24-Hour, 46%Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) Annual, 43% (from 2000)Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) 24-Hour, 44% (from 2000)Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) 1-Hour, 90%Numerous air toxics have declined with percentages varying by pollutantDuring this same period, the U.S. economy continued to grow, Americans drove more miles, and population and energy use increased.”The second question should be about the possibility of alternative explanations. The ""science"" says the sun is growing larger and brighter and will envelope the earth in 5 billion years. Solar flares and sunspots, the heat generated from the sun, the tilt of the earth, and the distance of the earth from the sun, are all assumed to be constant. Yet the ""science"" says the sun is quite active. Again, I don’t know the answer. I just have the questions.The final question is to what extent does the US contribute to the global level of carbon dioxide. Do we make a real difference? The US emitted 5.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2018, making up 15% of the world’s emissions. This will be significantly lower in the past two years for reasons related to the pandemic. The Chinese have recently gone back to burning coal. Only Europe seems committed to cutting CO2 emissions. Each of you can evaluate the commitment of your home state."

Just one more OT and I'll shut up. To the anti-vaxxers out there. I get the fear. I do. But consider. Here we have all the hospitals across the country overwhelmed with covid patients desperately sick. But in all of this you want to know what I'm not seeing? Not even one U.S. hospital is full of patients suffering the side-effects of the vaccine. Make of it what you will but.....
"WS dumps the miners!Between the sudden but short duration metal price crashes this past week, RIO, BHP and to an extent FcX share prices have been hit hard - the former two quite dramatically despite extraordinary profits and shareholder returns. On the FcX front - Vanguard and Blackrock have shed about 28M shares this past quarter. Fidelity, State Street and JP Morgan picked up about 22M shares between them. While the overall institutional ownership remains around 78% - some of these portfolio changes are interesting. Vanguard which held a consistent 152M shares - has dropped about 40M this year and in particular their MidCap Indexes dropped 22M shares - sold out all shares. One could argue that they feel no more cap appreciation to be had or don’t care about the dividends that maybe in the cards. On the other had - the number of hedge funds owning FcX shares has climbed to its all time high of 76! That may portend cap appreciation interest!FcX will have zero net debt by Q4 21. It will have the potential to pay a 3$ dividend in 22 if copper stays above 4$ and then drop in 2023 absent additional growth from the low hanging US options! Their silence on succession planning and any shareholder payouts until 2022 tells me they are either ultra conservative or avoiding any poison pills!BHP has made some gutsy calls - selling their coal assets and merging their Oil assets with Woodside. They also announced their 5.7 B potash Jansen project - but on their CC mentioned that could get axed if it did not meet their CaPex alloc criteria. Their CEO was not glowing about their copper portfolio and did not mention Spence on the call. There was some mention of reducing their operational footprint in Chile as well. If I was betting man, I would say they could pull the trigger on a merger for copper assets - hopefully with FcX. I was more bullish on RIO making a play, but will all the uncertainty with the variant and ability to dampen copper prices, not sure on a mega deal is in the works with RIO!In the meantime, the Wall Street roulette will continue around options and stale FcX share price. Let’s hope FcX makes some announcement soon on SH returns - or gets bought out to avoid the single driver of copper price to hold them up or blow them down!"
"Gold 1,817 Copper 4.32 Market green Someone or group trying to make sure FCX closes below 36.50 They are driving it backward Hope Buyers keeps it north of 36.50. Overall been a better day for FCX. Copper and FCX going up more next week. Ultra hope you jumped back on the train."
"Gold 1,805 Copper 4.22 Look for Copper to move past 4,25 Tomorrow. FCX 36 plus on the way to 38 this week. Hope you loaded up going long. Shorts will lose there shorts. Look for a huge volume day on FCX."

"To be clear, the $1.3 trillion infrastructure bill includes $550 in new spending programs, including roads, bridges, airports, rail service etc. It would also renew existing infrastructure and transportation programs set to expire at the end of September. This bill was approved in the Senate and should be easily approved in the House. It should have a positive impact on the price of copper.The $3.5 trillion social spending bill has not yet been written. The House narrowly passed a budget resolution and framework that allows the House (as the Senate) to approve the yet undrafted bill with a simple majority. The framework calls for a $3.5 trillion on spending for climate initiatives, paid leave, childcare, education and health care. The impact of this bill on the price of copper is likely to be negative, as higher corporate taxes are assumed to be included.The Speaker originally refused to advance the infrastructure bill until the social spending bill passed both houses. However 8-9 moderate House Democrats forced her concession to put the infrastructure bill to a vote by a September 27 deadline. I doubt that House Progressive Democrats and House Moderate Democrats will quickly agree as to which programs and taxes will be included in the social spending bill. This should mean that the $1.3 trillion infrastructure bill will pass both houses and be signed into law in October. (Optimistic but again, good for copper)However, If the House does manage to pass a fairly unpopular social spending bill by September 27, passage (under the budget reconciliation process) will require no Republican votes in either house -- assuming all Democrats Senators plus VP vote ""yes"". There are two Democratic senators (Manchin and Sinema) who have threatened to block passage. There may be more once the bill is written. There is also an issue with the debt ceiling that the Democrats did not address in their maneuvers. There will certainly need to be some deal making. Stay tuned. #FCX"
The data is now indisputable… man made global warming is resulting in adverse climate change…..fcx will contribute the copper for clean energy and the new electrical grid .
