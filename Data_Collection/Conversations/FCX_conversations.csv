"Rosatom ordered steam turbines for Bayimskiy copper project power supplyOKBM, subsidiary of State Corporate RosatomBy Roman BershanskiyPublished: Oct 26, 2021Excerpts:GDK Bayimskaya (under control of KAZ Minerals) and Atomflot (State Corporation Rosatom) during Eastern Economic Forum at Vladivostok signed preliminary power supply agreement for Bayimskiy copper ore process plant.Agreement was signed by Сhairman of the board of GDK Bayimskaya Mr.Oleg Novachuk and General Director of Atomflot Mr.Mustafa Kashka.In accordance with agreement, State Corporation Rosatom will provide power capacity for largest at ex-USSR territory copper and gold Bayimskaya ore zone. Atomflot will deliver four floating nuclear power units with rated capacity 110 MW each, operations of first two units will start near Cape Naglynyn in January 2027, third unit – January 2028, fourth unit will be delivered – in 2031. Generation CAPEX will be more than 2 billion USD.Permanent take or pay agreement will include take or pay conditions and electricity price 0.083 cent per kWth with annual adjustment in accordance with CPI.(OKBM, subsidiary of State Corporate Rosatom) announced result of tender for eight steam turbines, which will be installed at floating nuclear generation units for power supply of Bayimskiy copper process plant.Order placed at Kirovskiy power machine plant, which producing different ship steam turbines and gears since 1913. More than 100 power units were produced for different large ships, submarines, icebreakers. Plant placed in Saint-Petersburg.Turbines will have 58 MW rated value, first two units will be produced in 2023, third and fourth - in 2024, fifth and sixth - in 2025, and last two - in 2027. Total price for eight units - 197,6 MUSD (without VAT), including FAT, installation supervising and HAT.========================================================================================KAZ Minerals new, big, Russian copper/gold mine in the Chukotka region of Russia..........will be NUCLEAR POWERED with dedicated nuclear power generating units provided by Russia's Rosatom.Very cool. That's an industry first.The Russians are very big on developing the copper resources in the Chukotka region. This will be a 300,000k mt. per annum mine once complete, with half million oz. of gold by-product.And because you FCX Super Copper Bulls have never heard about it (or watch reports on CNBC about it), doesn't mean it's not out there.........coming to markets near you (and Dumb Farmer).KAZ Minerals shares trade in London. If you have a good broker, you can buy shares on the LSE. KAZ - It's a comer.......Time to wake up. More copper is coming. Lots more."
"Is fcx mining lithium? Don't see how that impacts copper or fcx..maybe someone just doesn't want to talk about cu and fcx price right now lol. What I want to know is if fcx is going over $40? Isn't that what most people come on a message board to see what can impact the share price in the near term. As a long and trader, I say yes.. Risk/reward is favorable for continued upward move. Why talk about something like lithium that may have a major supply issue when there is basic inflation in front of us? Are grocery and healthcare bathroom products like soap hard to find? No...but are the prices going up? Yes...retailers and manufacturers like p&g are raising prices across the board so why do you have to find something like lithium that may be in short supply years from now? Inflation is everywhere and that benefits commodities and stocks of companies that produce it. Keep it simple. Now just focus on whether fcx can hit $40 and beyond  Are you going to listen to someone who says he has no skin in the game or those longs who have money on it..your choice "
Looks like 4.40 Copper is in play. FCX is a cash cow at 3.50. Copper will move higher soon. Buy all the FCX on the small dip today you will be glad you did. This drop in market is a setup to try and get more free programs that our Country can't afford. Stand strong Joe from WV.
"There is never a dearth of surprises with FcX ERs. I was a bit taken aback with the Q3 OCF number which was just $2B - about 400M less than Q2 even with additional sales 100M lbs of copper and 97K oz of gold. Copper cash costs were down by a dime compared to Q2 as well. Add another 600M reduction from financing and investing resulted in just 1.4B in FCF and hence, net debt still hovers at 2B.What happened - they paid off the balance of royalties in the CV dispute to the tune of 300+ M this quarter. They also incurred about 79M in CaPex for the Indonesia smelter - which is just starting! Q4 cash flows will smart as well - why? They are projecting CaPex of 1B (up from 0.3, 0.5, 0.5 in the past three quarters) which includes 300M for the Indonesia smelter. It looks like the financing for the smelter is stuck at 1B and even with all the explanation that this occurs at the PTFI level - we are seeing more CaPex for FcX than planned.My best guess estimate is that FCF in Q4 will come in around 1.5B - resulting in net debt of about 0.5 B. It will be interesting to see how the board will decide on IF and HOW and HOW MUCH to return to shareholders. RA and KQ have made it quite difficult to project what this number should be by confounding it with an ever existing net debt level! It could be 1 to 1.4B$ if they choose to return 50% of what is above the target of 3B$ net debt - but could be zero to that number!The good thing is the Balance Sheet has been strengthened and Stock Holder Equity has crept up to 22+ B from ~18 B in Q3 2020.Given the hopeless messaging from management and inability to answer the SH return question from the GS analyst on the call - I hope they are seriously considering a suitor. It is not that the results were bad - the blah blah blah messages on future copper price strength and future returns to share holders is getting OLD - and this team just cannot seem to get out of the way. Just my opinion!"
"OT: Anyone tracking F? Could be something burbling over there. But disclosure, I've a core position in them from in the mid-single digits. Consider the source. Meanwhile, FCX bid $37.70 ahead of the bell, copper at $4.4268. Let's PLAY!"
"I expect FCX to get back to 38 today, if not close above it today."
Wouldn't argue with additional capacity coming.. Demand is the question between EV and Green infrastructure ? Believe unclear how it goes. Huge cables needed to connect countries. Not sure anyone can predict the future world yet. Dutch
"I have invested $K10 in this company months ago, and have lost so far, please give me a good reason why I should not sell? To me it looks like I am wasting my time, there are better companies that this. out there."
"It is all a matter of interpretation... the main question on the CC was asked by the GS analyst. Why the hesitation and delay in announcing the SH return since the net debt target was achieved a quarter ago - was it potential concern about an unknown future macro downturn or getting to future investment needs? She made RA and KQ squirm ...- RA's response was target achieved too early, talking to investors and changing mindset (meaning interest increasing for a buyback vs. divided), new board members coming on board, need to follow a process, and talk about in planned board meetings- KQ was more direct and said we just need to implement itTo think that 25M+ in compensation is not sufficient to make a call and announce one of the most important message to the market is quite shocking! Listening to the rest of the call clearly highlighted that most of the management team (Josh/Mark in addition to RA) has an engineering mindset - focused on fascinating pick and shovel details on mill rates, drill results and mining has complications that FcX knows how to handle! What is worse is the rest of the analysts probe these 'weed level details' and forget the forest for the trees!My hypothesis is that they will announce sooner than they are planning! Else, they need to stop mopping their brow and sell the company to someone who can put the shine on all the gold and copper they are getting out of the ground - instead of wallowing in the ore they blast out or the concentrate they mill out/leach pads they have stored! Willing to bet a share or two that they will announce soon!"
"Emily ChangGood morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question is just around capitals for tonnes. You clearly well below your net debt target here. But could you give us some color as to what's driving the hesitation around, maybe accelerating this announcement. Is it a macro uncertainty you talked a little bit about earlier or are we still balancing what the cadence of growth projects is in the next couple of years before announcing something positive then? Thank you.Richard AdkersonUsually it's just more a question of how quickly this is developed. When we set the policy, we were anticipating meeting our debt target sometimes out in the future. And it happened so quickly. Business has gone so well. We've added new board members. And so we accept much earlier, a process that would result in this being addressed after the beginning of the year when we got our annual results.And so we'll be talking with our board about it. We are also having engagements with a number of our significant shareholders about stock buybacks and dividends. From the traditional thinking, it is seems to be shifting some. But it's nothing about reluctance about the future that's causing us to do that. And we have regular scheduled board meetings and we talk about it every board meeting. So it's just more of a question of how we set process early on. And clearly we're making progress much faster because of markets, but also because of our execution than we had anticipated. And so it's a good situation, but that's why we are where we are.Kathleen QuirkAnd there's no hesitation, Emily, on this. We just got to implement it.Richard AdkersonYeah.Emily ChangAppreciate and looking forward to it.Richard AdkersonAll of us are, Emily, but thanks."

"London Metal Exchange has to restrain disorderly copperReutersBy Andy HomeOCT 21, 2021 10:45AM EDTExcerpts:LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - This was the week Doctor Copper turned disorderly.The London Metal Exchange (LME) was forced to apply the restraints as a ferocious squeeze rocked the market, with the premium for cash metal spiralling out of control to an unprecedented $1,103.50 per tonne at one stage on Monday as the exchange's monthly prompt date descended into chaos.TROUBLE WITH COPPERIt's clear from both LME and Trafigura statements that the two have been in regulatory dialogue about the trader's copper positions and its draw on exchange stocks.Cynics will scoff at the company's quoted claim the metal is needed to satisfy customer needs in China and Asia, but global exchange stocks of copper were just 312,200 tonnes at the end of September with Shanghai stocks sitting at a multi-year low of 43,500 tonnes.Compare and contrast with the early 1990s copper market, when the LME warehouse system - much more geographically concentrated than it is now - held more than 600,000 tonnes at one stage. Indeed, the ballooning costs of supporting the copper price in a surplus market were what did for Sumitomo's Hamanaka in the end.Is the current dearth of LME copper a manufactured shortage or another sign of a broader supply-chain crisis?We're going to find out very shortly since every available tonne of copper should be heading towards an LME warehouse to capitalise on the record delivery incentive.For now tom-next has stopped flashing red, slipping back into more orderly contango Thursday morning, suggesting the turmoil has abated.But if exchange stocks don't rebuild, the LME Special Committee is going to have its work cut out.======================================================================================LME actions being taken against Trafigura taking the phony steam out of the manipulated LME copper market, and the price is correcting. The mirage of ""copper market tightness"" was all engineered and phony according to the LME. Trafigura will find themselves in court, dragged there by commercial parties in due course."
"Rio Tinto says 60 Jadar mines wouldn’t fill looming lithium gapMININGBy Cecilia JamasmieOctober 21, 2021 | 3:27 am Battery Metals Top Companies Australia Europe Lithium Excerpts:Rio Tinto (ASX, LON, NYSE: RIO) joined the rising chorus of companies and analysts warning of an imminent and “significant” supply gap for lithium, as demand for the metal used in electric vehicles (EV) and green technologies continues to soar. The world’s second-largest miner, which greenlighted in July the $2.4 billion Jadar lithium project in Serbia, believes the supply gap needs to be addressed “within the next ten years.” In a presentation to investors, Rio Tinto’s head of economics Vivek Tulpule said EV sales are on track to hit up to 55% of the world’s total light vehicles sales as early as 2030, reaching about 65 million units. This means manufacturers would need about three million tonnes of lithium, compared with the roughly 350,000 tonnes they consume today, Tulpule noted. Existing operations and projects combined, however, are slated to contribute one million tonnes of lithium, he said. Rio Tinto estimates that committed supply and capacity expansions will contribute about 15% to demand growth over the 2020-2050 period. The remaining 85% would need to come from new projects. “Filling the supply gap will require over 60 Jadar projects,” he warned. Jadar, located in western Serbia, would produce enough lithium to power one million electric vehicles, Rio has said. It will also produce boric acid, used in ceramics and batteries, and sodium sulphate, used in detergents. Mine construction is expected to begin early next year, subject to environmental approvals, with the first production in 2026. Following ramp up to full production in 2029, the Jadar mine will produce 58,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate, 160,000 tonnes of boric acid and 255,000 tonnes of sodium sulphate a year. ========================================================================================Rio Tinto probably knows what they are talking about here on this topic of lithium.This is where you WILL see the real shortages materialize (lithium) which will act as a THE road block limiting sales proliferation of EV's as production of lithium-ion batteries is limited simply by what can be produced annually by lithium mining companies.Cobalt and nickel supply are NOT the road blocks, and certainly NOT copper supply. But lithium IS a problem and will limit the amount of 'non-carbon, emitting flying unicorns' you Super Copper Bulls think you'll see whizzing up and down the highways of the world.Keep your fantasies on the real side, otherwise you'll slam into that wall day dreaming about carbon free unicorns and free gumdrops for all........"
exchange and nonexchange copper inventories released after todays bell shows copper inventories continue to plunge....and i mean plunge.....there is no magical invisable reserve to fill the gap
$38 is in the cards today. Loving the OI in options from 38-42 this week and November 19.
Tim Seymour named FCX as his Final Trade on Fast Money today as “its a free cash flow machine”
Unless you are playing options..as a long you should be happy ..an earnings beat with the ave cu price of $4.2 and better than expected costs. .those expecting a dividend announcement are disappointed but why? Last call they already said next year. The stock has held most of the gains in the run up and above the moving averages...it absorbed a 16cent pullback .I'll trade a small lost in sp over a 16 cent loss in cu price. Plus as some have mentioned fcx doesn't really move on earnings day and usually has a delayed reaction maybe due to options expiration. Let some options expire and get some of the hot money out from last week. Not much you can do unless you can day trade it successfully...looking for a breakout of $39 before it's all clear for the longs.
"KAZ Minerals approves 300,000 t/y Baimskaya copper-gold project in RussiaInternational MiningPosted by Paul MooreSeptember 28th, 2021Excerpts:KAZ Minerals has announced that the Bankable Feasibility Study for the Baimskaya copper project in Russia has been completed and approved by the KAZ Minerals Ltd Board of Directors. This represents a significant project milestone enabling the group to progress with the financing and construction of this world-class copper asset.The Baimskaya copper project is the planned development of a globally significant copper resource with a forecast capital construction cost of $8.5 billion. The mine is expected to have a life of 20+ years and will start up by the end of 2027, with average annual copper production of 300,000 t and gold production of 490,000 oz during the first ten full years of operation.Life of mine copper and gold processing grades are estimated at 0.47% and 0.27 g/t respectively, with elevated grades expected in the early years of production. The project has competitive net cash costs and is expected to be in the first quartile on the global cost curve. Historic data and drilling conducted during the BFS indicate the potential for the mine life to be extended.The processing plant will have a total ore processing capacity of 70 Mt/y from two lines, building on the technologies used at the group’s Aktogay and Bozshakol mines in Kazakhstan.======================================================================================This one is further out (2027 start-up) but it's a big (big!), new copper development coming from KAZ Minerals, out of Russia (vs. their Kazakhstan home base of operations).They're looking at multi-billion dollar financing from Gazprombank. All those Russian gas profits gotta get invested somewhere, and the Ruskies are dropping it into the countries mining industry, in particular, copper and gold mines.Who says the world's copper miners aren't building new copper projects........?"
Bloomberg says Codelco strike is reducing copper supply. CU price will go up to reflect that in a few days. long.
