My model shows fair value of $21 but that's using a 25 year depreciation schedule. Evidence shows these ships are used for ~20. One was recently scrapped at 19 years. Given the new builds have much greener outputs. I think the 25 years is not realistic. Using a 20 year schedule the fair value is $17.55 (using updated financials). So this seems fair price. I will thus be selling out of most of my position from $45k down to $8k (and buy back if the shares tank again).
This stock is just a dividend paying machine and I'm very happy with it.
I have been watching this for about a month now and it seems to be an excellent investment for yield. And pretty good potential for gain since much below historic trading price. My concern is that most of its business is in Brazil and it seems politically unstable especially with the risks of coronavirus in their population and the recent turnover in national health position. My question is who/what entity is obligated for the shuttle contracts down there? Are they all Brazil based companies or multinationals that are signed on contracts. I am looking to go long on this. Thanks in advance.
"My thanks to those who alerted me to buy when the stock was below $20 and in $18 area. Happy to have bought then now that stock is above $20. (Of course, I might not be so happy if stock drops back down -g-)"
"Opportunity to accumulate more as this is a small market cap below institutional radar viewed by many who have not done their homework as ""shipping"" and maybe vulnerable to short term spot market pricing. BUT it is much better cash machine. Limited analyst coverage and small cap keeps the fast traders and hedge fund folks away. Keep a low profile, keep delivering stable moderate growth cash flow."
"Anything buying opportunity, not sure why this thing doesn't take off? Interest rates are going to help this company BUILD up massive cash balance (either more drop downs, or pay off debt faster) Or div raise?"
"Ok, .52 per unit, ex 1/29, paid Feb 13....per etradeAll good!"
"As of 11/19/20: KNOT Offshore Partners LP ( KNOP) said Thursday that it booked a net income of $25.1 million in Q3, an increase from $14.1 million in the same period last year.The shuttle tanker operator generated revenue of $71.3 million, slightly up from $70.3 million a year ago."
"Glad Knop held its ground today, with a little aftermarket. I started at 19 per share back in Nov, finally averaged down to 13, where I see a little green. Hope it works for everyone."
buy in 10.69
Good thing Scott isint the CEO of the company!
"This stock is completely been misunderstood due to it's connection to oil/gas business. For oil company to make profit, the higher the crude price, the higher the profit. When oil price goes down and demand is low, the oil tanks are essentially been used as container to hold the over production, so the need to such tank is much higher than regular production. With all the oil producer and driller scrambling for place to store the oil, they are guaranteed business and cash flow. they deserve much higher price than it is now."
Can someone help explain to me how Knot Offshore Partners LP plans will survive rising interest rates? The vast majority of their loans are variable but their revenue stream from their long-term contracts are not tied to interest rates. Won't any increase in interest rates cause their interest burden to increase substantially?
rock solid... this will go back up.... buy all you can
"Just an FYI, earnings will be lower again but cash flow will be great. They will show paper losses due to deceased mark to market value of their interest rate swaps. Given interest rates (LIBOR) cannot drop much more I see this being the last quarter reflecting this."
Brent crude up to $58 a barrel and trending toward $60 by spring. That’s a fairly profitable number for most oil drillers so bodes well for our clients executing their extension options.
Analyst gave KNOP a $22 price target wonder if that will ever happen and shen
"although their financials show a slight weaking, they do not show perusahaan as a customer in their list of major customers."
Small cap and small float with insiders owning 27% and top 5 outside shareholders holding 24%
I don't get it. They beat earnings and have great forward looking business and the price stays flat?
"GREAT BUY AT THESE LEVELS. they will report another BIG loss next QUARTER, but only PAPER LOSS because of their interest rate swaps and the massive decrease in LIBOR will hurt them, but will not effect their free cash flow!"
Might KNOP be next for a Fortress acquisition deal? Would be worth a 30% KNOP premium with lots of synergies from such a combination. Lets wat for unusual option and stock volume activity in the months ahead? Energy infrastructure firm New Fortress Energy Inc. (NFE) announced Wednesday that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire Hygo Energy Transition Ltd. in a cash a stock transaction valued at $5.28 billion.
Great earnings for KNOP...moving up nicely
"I think why the stock has not performed well this year, in addition to MLP is being out of favor, it shows that it has missed earnings all year do. But this is simply for the planned dry docking that they already allocate money for. Shows the extraordinary large operating expense but in reality that cost is factored in preemptively. Chose unusually large profit misses this year but in times when they don't have dry dock it will show extraordinarily large profits. That is the only gas that I have, if any of you at any other suggestions I'm all ears."
"I'm just holding....with a 17%+ divy...got over 5K++ on the last divy...sitting on my 10,000 shares with a avg price of 12.85."
"Please note the following for tax purposes: I use E*Trade and when I auto import my 1099 into Turbo Tax they incorrectly apply the tax treatment for KNOP common units. They put 100% of the dividends into qualified dividends while a large portion (still unknown for 2020, but ranging from 30-50% if the past is any predictor) is actually return of capital, WHICH is not-taxable!"

"Can someone convince me why I should continue to hold onto this stock? They are near fair value (so upside potential is VERY limited). They only have NEGATIVE headwind risks (loss of revenue due to off-hire time, lower leases, aging ships, more 'green' shuttles being built). This all leads to higher risk for their distributions. So vs. last year their yields are lower yet their risks are higher with no/limited upside. Additionally if their common units appreciate they will simply dilute their unit-holders by selling more shares to fund a drop down. The drop down will increase the cash flow but the excess will simply go to the new shares created. The upside is just not there any more. I was holding 8% of my portfolio, Now I'm down to 3% and thinking about keeping at these levels, maybe selling down to ~2% and waiting to buy back later (since I do not run the risk of their share-price appreciating much)...THOUGHTS?"
Keep the .52 cent dividend coming... allows me to buy more shares quarterly
Hidden Gem in this Market!
What happened today any news I missed?
"Will see some carryover from HMLP. I own both and yesterday after hours, HMLP announced after hours that it was cutting dividend to $0.01 from $0.44 due to a charterer not signing renewal agreement and causing refinancing to fall apart as well as former parent announcing not renewing revolving credit expiring in 2023. The panic happening over there will waft some stink over here. If you trust parent and charterers here, there is opportunity here to be greedy in face of other’s fearfulness. HMLP charters for Liquid Natural Gas on FSRUs (floating storage and regasification units). Not offering advice as much as putting out information I would want to know."
"Oil tankers have a commercial life expectancy of about 30 years. Less than 50,000 dwt, mainly used for transportation of refined products (gasoline, gasoil). Approximately 80,000 dwt, which is the AFRA (Average Freight Rate Assessment) standard."
"Scott, can you just move on? Thought the greek bath houses would keep you busy."
Another drop down announced with nice long contract. An additional like of credit added. Upside to $20
Last quarter they paid down 19 million in debt and increased their cash position by 9 million. Continue to head in the right direction. Now they really need to get Windsor under contract for 2021 to offset the 30 day dry dock of another vessel in Feb and start planning how their going to deal with the Aug 2021 debt maturity. The sooner they get the moderna and Pfizer vaccines distributed the better
Why the drop in price yesterday? It is not ex dividend until close of business today. Did I miss something? My apologies if this is stupid. I have only been following this for 2 months and owned for 1 1/2 months. Tempted to buy more today at 13.50 and still get the dividend.
KNOP is trading at a forward P/E of 8.7 - my guess is that it should be trading in the $30-$35 range - JMHO
"Well.....nothing really to complain about. We are just enjoying the ride, albeit a roller coaster ride lately. A white knuckle ride sometimes, but it's all good. And another big dividend payout on February 14th if they stay on schedule, which anyone shorting the stock will have to pay. Anyone having anything bad to say about KNOP please chime in."
KNOP earnings are out and things are looking good. KNOP is the sweetest 10+ % return I have ever had.
"I can not understand why the share price has been dropping.From what I can see, this company provides a very high dividendwith apparently very little risk."
We have ignition!
"Earnings are out. It appears that the derivative issues in the income statement have subsided, at least for this reporting quarter.http://www.knotoffshorepartners.com/investor-relations/investor-information/news/press-release-details/2020/KNOT-Offshore-Partners-LP-Earnings-ReleaseInterim-Results-for-the-Period-Ended-June-30-2020/default.aspx"
Any ideas what’s going on?
enjoying this move higher. glad i invested at much lower prices!
Anyone else buying up a storm?
thanks Knop!
Wow..first good news my portfolio has had for a while. Adding as well. trader
"Their earnings are going to kill it, no scheduled drydock, fully utilized, their derivatives are priced at the close of the corner and there was very little movement and interest rates."
"Our mother company, Sales of two older shuttle tankers lifts KNOT to annual profit.Vessel value should be able to be similar at KNOP in my opinion, What you guy's think?"
"I have been watching my unrealized loss on share price long enough that I was tempted to sell when my loss was recovered then reversed to a small gain. Then I realized, where can I invest for a reliable double digit yield? Staying put for long term. Where do you guys see this in 1-2 years?"
On my watch list for over 2 years....bought 5000 shares under 13 today. Been reading the transcripts. No brainer on this one.
"KNOT stock was overtaken by HOEGH today, making it 15% weaker than its performance in one month. Why is KNOT so much weaker?"
"Over the last 3 years when ever the stock price hits 20 that's the hi. On ex div day, the price drops OVER one point if you want to score cheap stock."
Jump on the boat today. Somebody sold for 18.5 in begining of session. Looks like great EBITDA at same time as book value is steady or rising. They actually make money to pay the divi and not just return my own money. Now will sit with this in 3-5 years and collect the 11.25% divi every year 
"Decent report. We now know we have at least 18 months of revenue coming from Windsor between the insurance payment and the new short term contract. I would normally be a little concerned about 2022 based on the Bodil option also not getting picked up this year but they took action and got all three Shell ships extended on 3 year charters which addresses a lot of the 2022 option expiry. From what I’m seeing, it appears the market is a little flat for older ships."
What’s going on with this stock in the last two days
Why the big drop today?
"the latest 3q earning news were great. This partnership in on it's way to build operational equity through extra fee collected deducting operation cost. The cost is down due to lower borrowing now and future. US dollar is about getting weaker, all point better FFO (future increase of dividend?)"
Everything is down today. The smart money says the world may end this weekend.
Not much chat on this stock
How low might this stock go in a down market
"I have been trading KNOP for years but today I picked up a lot of shares for keeps. With the new ship, lowering debt and 14% dividend and strong management, this is a keeper. 2021 will be in the 20s."
"Now if we could get them to stop messing around with derivatives..... seriously, solid business, revenues and expenses about the same from year to but lately the derivative losses have been hurting pretty significantly."
Any ideas about this stock?
"I LOVE THE dividend, it's 100% unsustainable. They are paying out the replacement costs of their ships. The small amount of retained earnings are not even enough to cover dry docks and other CAPEX expenses"
"Hi all, I've been trying to average down through all of this. Reading the last company call, seemed like their outlook was still fairly poitive. I'm looking to add quite a bit more, but wanted to check in with you more seasoned investors to see what your thoughts were with so much uncertainty. Any guidance appreciated. Tks"
"For you long term holders. With the drop down and potential increase in cash flow of 6%, are we likely to see increased dividend or will the money go to debt service and capex on older ships. I don’t know what to wish for here as I plan to hold my 7000 shares long term but only in it since summer 2020."
"Company does over 8.00 a share in revenue.....its tight as far as the dividend is concerned....they have lots of debt for such a small company, but great mgt makes up for this......thats why they are able to keep the dividend at current levels."
Div just announced same as last quarter
"KNOT Offshore Partners declares $0.52 dividendJul. 15, 2020 5:09 PM ET|About: KNOT Offshore Partners LP (KNOP)|By: Vandana Singh, SA News Editor KNOT Offshore Partners (NYSE:KNOP) declares $0.52/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous.Forward yield 14.76%Payable Aug. 13; for shareholders of record July 30; ex-div July 29."
How come no action on this forum?
Have a listen to the HESS cc......there has to be more work coming
"Is it just me or is this probably one of the top investments in the market right now? I am NOT talking about companies to make the most money or momentum trading like AMAZON, Apple, etc. I mean based on the valuations, future earnings, downside risk, and upside capital appreciation (closer to book value). This seems like a no brainer."
"CEQP-P the preferred is another good one if you can be patient and get it at $6.00 or below. Non callable, cumulative preferred at 14%."
"If they could just once issue a low ball guidance, they might meet or exceed earnings expectations, instead of missing everytime.....I love the company and the stock, but they are not doing us any favors by not meeting earnings expectations."
a bit scary environment w/ an offshore driller like Diamond Offshre filing for chap 11 bk.
"Wow, this company just even more valuable. They extended a contract out to to 2022, which lowers overall risk to this company due to low oil prices."
Dividend of 52 cents/share on Friday. TGIF
Any idea why KNOP is dropping today?
Earnings report was good. 1.20 distribution coverage.
KNOP holding up well during this market turmoil.
What's the reason for today's run-up?
How is this stock not more popular. Take a look at their dividend payment history. They are like a div paying machine?
Rising crude oil prices could be materially positive for this company if they can negotiate higher contracts going forward. Even a 10% upside in contacts would be huge.
"just got my 1099 from scottrade that listed the knot dividend as non qualified. went to the company site and the 2017 dividend status is not listed yet, the 2016 dividends are listed as qualified, maybe I'm too earley any ideas?"
Anyone see dividend? Paid today.
Paid off 25 million in debt last quarter. That’s great. Could be on track to get debt down to 800 million by the end of 2021. Only risk I see is Shell opted out of their extension option on one ship and they have three additional ships they could determine not to extend in a year or so which could cause KNOP to have some issues finding alternative cash flow for them
"OK, a couple questions. If someone can help me understand how this company manages to claim they are expenses 15M per quarter for dry docking and other CAPEX estimates yet they do not actually set this money aside? If you look at their distributions to Pref + Common they have less than $15M to put this money aside. The money is going to pay expenses, interest, pay down debt, etc.). So when they need to pay for Dry dock or CAPEX that's means they will draw on their credit line. Am I missing something? My NPV of FCF shows Knot Offshores slowly depleted their cash at the expense of distributions and debt pay down (which is important). This makes me thing they will have to cut their distribution 35%-50% to actually account for the $ shortfall."
Any chance they have to stop their charters? or will they keep on going?
Getting really tired of this stock.
"Hello fellow knotters, any thoughts on sustaining current dividends? I'm sensing a cut, but absolutely nothing to back that suspicion, outside of the gradual price retraction and overall market sentiment. I was a bit surprised ( happily) they kept it untouched last go round. I have a fairly large position, and appreciate any thoughts or concerns others may have."
"Hi. New KNOP long checking in. Can someone please advise, are any fees imposed by your brokerage, on the distributions from UK based KNOP ? thank you"
"Seems KNOP decided to buy back shares...bought 1K with five different purchases over the course of the afternoon and the price never varied from $10.7-10.75...just hope this doesn’t turn into another GLOP GMLP, which both appeared to be very rosy and solid, only to tank and screw the shareholders...time will tell..."
"This is a great stock. Not only an income stock, it's now a growth stock (limited upside, but still significant)"
why is everyone hassling on NAT stock?this is a sound investment with some contracts locked in to 2022.why is KNOP down by 30%??
"Have done my research. Company is only getting better over previous years and pandemic seems to only had increased its EBITDA profitability by 2%. I'm not sure why this stock is highly volatile and has a beta of 1.35. It makes no sense as business is so solid, constantly growing and has a huge piggy bank to endure hard times. But hey, if people can't seem to hold boring stocks then this volatility presents a good opportunity to sell your shares when they get high and buy the dip when restless investors decide to look for something more shiny. It would present extra CAGR which this stock lacks."
KNOP is just not getting enough love from the market. My guess is that the small size of the company has it off the radar. Hope for the day that that changes. Until then I will just bank the dividends.
"Any long that have been around care to comment. I have just started to research in dept, so any feed back is welcome.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-logistics-unit-mulls-suspending-173927797.html"
"Fwiw, Knop initiated as buy by B. Riley to 20, per news on etrade this am."
"I added to my position this morning. No dry dockings this year, 99% utilization, outlook looks good."
"Just doubled my (modest) position today. ~12.5% yield, no virus exposure, well managed, stable business. Thanks Mr Market."
"The oil price has fallen sharply today, but what does that scratch KNOP or e.g. HMLP? The NG price has even risen slightly, so obviously no drop in demand is expected from the market. Thus also no lower transport demand. On the contrary, I assume that in exchange for the acceptance of Nord-Stream 2 by the USA, Germany and other European countries will buy additional LNG from the USA. The waiver of sanctions was certainly not free. This means that there will also be a higher demand for transport.I see this as a cheap opportunity to buy before the dividend. I will never understand how, with such prospects, one can panic so much and destroy one's own assets because of a drop in the price of a commodity with which the company held does not even have anything to do directly."
"Meanwhile 1,59 below yesterdays opening price. Nearly 3fold dividend.Very good way to lose money whith taking dividend."
great concept with wide moat...net lease service boats to oil companies to travel to their off shore platforms. No competitors. An LP conservatively managed. Very undervalued.
Nice rise in the stock since earnings. Holding on to my 17%+ divy when I bought in the $12 range
Think we all call investor relations and ask for clarification . Simple and most direct way
"Distribution announced!!! .52 per share! Ex 10/30, pay 11/13. Sweet!"
"No dry docking s for 2019, revenue is going to be very solid and predictable....good report...expenses are very well contained and growth probably 2020...nowhere to go but up!!"
"I am a long-time holder who sold a small post yesterday, today I got them back slightly lower today (3.8%). This was not planned, but guessing luck. Will keep holding and reinvest the dividend."
can someone tell me how a small cap shuttle boat operating company with just 1 full time employee can afford to pay out a 9.67% dividend yield?
Great report and distribution unchanged. Sounds like it may not be cut. Which is great.
Great report. 50% total return in the next 12 months.
https://www.aet-tankers.com/media-centre/aet-secures-long-term-dpst-charter-contracts-with-shell/
Listened to today investor call. Seems like their first priority is the dividend. The negative is they have 4 ships coming off contract in 2022 that have not been renewed yet.
"The trigger for the HMLP problems, which apparently also have a negative impact on the KNOT share price, is a challenge to the contract by the charterer of the ship that is most important for their sales. The whole thing is to be settled by arbitration at the instigation of the charterer.The charterer is the Indonesian PT Perusahaan Gas Negara. Since this is a publicly traded company, it is easy to find out the essential data about the company. In short, this company is not very successful and there are indications that it wants to reduce the charter due to its own difficulties. Which ultimately also means some risk of default by this customer in the long run.Unfortunately, I have not found any information on KNOT about their charterers. One can only hope that KNOT does not do business with this company."
"Remember this post from over 4 months ago!! Some of you bought!!!""CEQP-P the preferred is another good one if you can be patient and get it at $6.00 or below. Non callable, cumulative preferred at 14%.""I'm killin it......have 200K in CEQP-P at a little under 6.00 a share, now over $7.50 with a 14%+ divy."
"KNOP gets no respect....its the R Dangerfield of Oil Transportation....why, I have no idea....I am buying on every dip."
I've held on to this stock for several years and enjoyed the generous dividend. I'm thinking about selling all my shares once it hits $21.
"Shouldn't KNOT benefit from the rising NG price. Higher NG price indicates higher demand, certainly also for LNG. This means higher demand for transport capacity, which should also mean better transport rates in the long term. So in the long term, at least stable, rather better business prospects for ship owners. So far, there is no sign of a positive reaction at KNOT. Am I making a mistake in my thinking?"
What happened today? Minus more than 3% ???
"Increase in earnings estimates-""01:20 AM EDT, 08/28/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Knot Offshore Partners LP's (NYSE:KNOP, Recent Price: 12.53) Q3 quarterly and 2021 full year forecasted earnings estimates for the periods ending September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2021 respectively, have been scaled up.

Time to load up again back to $20 soon by next week
"Word of caution to current/potential KNOP investors. It looks like the company will likely be issuing shares and diluting shareholders: ""On August 26, 2021, the Partnership entered into a sales agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”). Under the terms of the ‘at the market’ sales agreement, the Partnership may offer and sell up to $100 million of common units (the “ATM program”), from time to time, through the Agent. The Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of any sales of offered units for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of indebtedness or the funding of acquisitions or other capital expenditures."""
"This PR had everything i wanted to hear. In particular, ""Due to the nature of its charters, the Partnership’s operations are not exposed to short-term fluctuations in oil prices, volume of oil transported or global oil storage capacity. Furthermore, its vessels operate in areas where the oil being produced typically has a lower marginal cost than that produced in other parts of the world.""He knocked it out of the park with one simple paragraph....exactly what I encouraged him to convey to shareholders in an email not too long ago. Glad he listened...but wish he had at least responded. Oh well. I'll take it. Will continue to add on any weakness."
I didn’t think we’d hit $65 Brent this fast. My energy stocks are going through the roof. 2021 looks solid for KNOP
Selling into the divy rally...2.00 +.....see ya on the other side.
I added today. I hope they come to their senses and buy back stock. It will be their best investment to get 20% return
liking this move...in KNOP and oil!
"I was wrong. This filing was done to renew the previous filing that was set to expire. That said, it's down right AWFUL TIMING. Reach out to investor relations if you don't believe me."
I’m 70 y/o and am looking to add this to my IRA fund. Looking for steady Div and stable share price over time. All comments welcome
"“ The purchase price of the Acquisition is $117.8 million, less $93.1 million of outstanding indebtedness and will be financed on a non-dilutive basis using cash on hand and borrowings under KNOP's existing revolving credit facility”"
There are four ships available next year for long term lease if they can’t lease these ships how bad will that be for the share price?
Added back to Cushing mlp index on 9/11. I never did understand why it was removed from index in the summer for nblx. Now it is replacing rtlr. Should increase buyers in near future if etfs rebalance.
Insiders hold 26.48% of the float which is very impressive. The POR is 75% another bullish point.
1 Full time employee ????..explain....?
They will show worse than expected earnings because of paper losses on their interest rate swaps. However their cash flow will remain strong. Long term investors will know this but short term traders will get spooked my decrease in earnings (remember this quarter experienced a ~1% decrease in libor)
I enjoy this stock. Thinking we’ll be right around $20.10 again before the ex dividend date.
Ripping higher...even caught me by surprise. What to do ????
Seriously? Yahoo lists one employee…must be a GREAT employee
