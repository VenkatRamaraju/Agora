How low might this stock go in a down market
"My thanks to those who alerted me to buy when the stock was below $20 and in $18 area. Happy to have bought then now that stock is above $20. (Of course, I might not be so happy if stock drops back down -g-)"
"Is it just me or is this probably one of the top investments in the market right now? I am NOT talking about companies to make the most money or momentum trading like AMAZON, Apple, etc. I mean based on the valuations, future earnings, downside risk, and upside capital appreciation (closer to book value). This seems like a no brainer."
"The trigger for the HMLP problems, which apparently also have a negative impact on the KNOT share price, is a challenge to the contract by the charterer of the ship that is most important for their sales. The whole thing is to be settled by arbitration at the instigation of the charterer.The charterer is the Indonesian PT Perusahaan Gas Negara. Since this is a publicly traded company, it is easy to find out the essential data about the company. In short, this company is not very successful and there are indications that it wants to reduce the charter due to its own difficulties. Which ultimately also means some risk of default by this customer in the long run.Unfortunately, I have not found any information on KNOT about their charterers. One can only hope that KNOT does not do business with this company."
"Over the last 3 years when ever the stock price hits 20 that's the hi. On ex div day, the price drops OVER one point if you want to score cheap stock."
Another drop down announced with nice long contract. An additional like of credit added. Upside to $20
What happened today any news I missed?
Listened to today investor call. Seems like their first priority is the dividend. The negative is they have 4 ships coming off contract in 2022 that have not been renewed yet.
Analyst gave KNOP a $22 price target wonder if that will ever happen and shen
KNOP is trading at a forward P/E of 8.7 - my guess is that it should be trading in the $30-$35 range - JMHO
Time to load up again back to $20 soon by next week
I've held on to this stock for several years and enjoyed the generous dividend. I'm thinking about selling all my shares once it hits $21.
"Company does over 8.00 a share in revenue.....its tight as far as the dividend is concerned....they have lots of debt for such a small company, but great mgt makes up for this......thats why they are able to keep the dividend at current levels."
What happened today? Minus more than 3% ???
Good thing Scott isint the CEO of the company!
"I am a long-time holder who sold a small post yesterday, today I got them back slightly lower today (3.8%). This was not planned, but guessing luck. Will keep holding and reinvest the dividend."
"KNOT Offshore Partners declares $0.52 dividendJul. 15, 2020 5:09 PM ET|About: KNOT Offshore Partners LP (KNOP)|By: Vandana Singh, SA News Editor KNOT Offshore Partners (NYSE:KNOP) declares $0.52/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous.Forward yield 14.76%Payable Aug. 13; for shareholders of record July 30; ex-div July 29."
I’m 70 y/o and am looking to add this to my IRA fund. Looking for steady Div and stable share price over time. All comments welcome
"Will see some carryover from HMLP. I own both and yesterday after hours, HMLP announced after hours that it was cutting dividend to $0.01 from $0.44 due to a charterer not signing renewal agreement and causing refinancing to fall apart as well as former parent announcing not renewing revolving credit expiring in 2023. The panic happening over there will waft some stink over here. If you trust parent and charterers here, there is opportunity here to be greedy in face of other’s fearfulness. HMLP charters for Liquid Natural Gas on FSRUs (floating storage and regasification units). Not offering advice as much as putting out information I would want to know."
"Shouldn't KNOT benefit from the rising NG price. Higher NG price indicates higher demand, certainly also for LNG. This means higher demand for transport capacity, which should also mean better transport rates in the long term. So in the long term, at least stable, rather better business prospects for ship owners. So far, there is no sign of a positive reaction at KNOT. Am I making a mistake in my thinking?"
"Have done my research. Company is only getting better over previous years and pandemic seems to only had increased its EBITDA profitability by 2%. I'm not sure why this stock is highly volatile and has a beta of 1.35. It makes no sense as business is so solid, constantly growing and has a huge piggy bank to endure hard times. But hey, if people can't seem to hold boring stocks then this volatility presents a good opportunity to sell your shares when they get high and buy the dip when restless investors decide to look for something more shiny. It would present extra CAGR which this stock lacks."
There are four ships available next year for long term lease if they can’t lease these ships how bad will that be for the share price?
"Distribution announced!!! .52 per share! Ex 10/30, pay 11/13. Sweet!"
Paid off 25 million in debt last quarter. That’s great. Could be on track to get debt down to 800 million by the end of 2021. Only risk I see is Shell opted out of their extension option on one ship and they have three additional ships they could determine not to extend in a year or so which could cause KNOP to have some issues finding alternative cash flow for them
"For you long term holders. With the drop down and potential increase in cash flow of 6%, are we likely to see increased dividend or will the money go to debt service and capex on older ships. I don’t know what to wish for here as I plan to hold my 7000 shares long term but only in it since summer 2020."
Not much chat on this stock
Any ideas about this stock?
"As of 11/19/20: KNOT Offshore Partners LP ( KNOP) said Thursday that it booked a net income of $25.1 million in Q3, an increase from $14.1 million in the same period last year.The shuttle tanker operator generated revenue of $71.3 million, slightly up from $70.3 million a year ago."
"The oil price has fallen sharply today, but what does that scratch KNOP or e.g. HMLP? The NG price has even risen slightly, so obviously no drop in demand is expected from the market. Thus also no lower transport demand. On the contrary, I assume that in exchange for the acceptance of Nord-Stream 2 by the USA, Germany and other European countries will buy additional LNG from the USA. The waiver of sanctions was certainly not free. This means that there will also be a higher demand for transport.I see this as a cheap opportunity to buy before the dividend. I will never understand how, with such prospects, one can panic so much and destroy one's own assets because of a drop in the price of a commodity with which the company held does not even have anything to do directly."
Why the big drop today?
I have been watching this for about a month now and it seems to be an excellent investment for yield. And pretty good potential for gain since much below historic trading price. My concern is that most of its business is in Brazil and it seems politically unstable especially with the risks of coronavirus in their population and the recent turnover in national health position. My question is who/what entity is obligated for the shuttle contracts down there? Are they all Brazil based companies or multinationals that are signed on contracts. I am looking to go long on this. Thanks in advance.
"Word of caution to current/potential KNOP investors. It looks like the company will likely be issuing shares and diluting shareholders: ""On August 26, 2021, the Partnership entered into a sales agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”). Under the terms of the ‘at the market’ sales agreement, the Partnership may offer and sell up to $100 million of common units (the “ATM program”), from time to time, through the Agent. The Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of any sales of offered units for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of indebtedness or the funding of acquisitions or other capital expenditures."""
"Opportunity to accumulate more as this is a small market cap below institutional radar viewed by many who have not done their homework as ""shipping"" and maybe vulnerable to short term spot market pricing. BUT it is much better cash machine. Limited analyst coverage and small cap keeps the fast traders and hedge fund folks away. Keep a low profile, keep delivering stable moderate growth cash flow."
How is this stock not more popular. Take a look at their dividend payment history. They are like a div paying machine?
Earnings report was good. 1.20 distribution coverage.
"the latest 3q earning news were great. This partnership in on it's way to build operational equity through extra fee collected deducting operation cost. The cost is down due to lower borrowing now and future. US dollar is about getting weaker, all point better FFO (future increase of dividend?)"
"I have been trading KNOP for years but today I picked up a lot of shares for keeps. With the new ship, lowering debt and 14% dividend and strong management, this is a keeper. 2021 will be in the 20s."
Anyone see dividend? Paid today.
"Meanwhile 1,59 below yesterdays opening price. Nearly 3fold dividend.Very good way to lose money whith taking dividend."
Insiders hold 26.48% of the float which is very impressive. The POR is 75% another bullish point.
