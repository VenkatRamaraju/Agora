PS. Buying back preferred's sub par is a great move!
Boo......ka........ka!
If you have not viewed today’s presentation by flex FLNG you need to. This is how a serious management team builds shareholder value. In today’s shipping market even Guap steam vassals should be able to produce revenue that supports a higher share price unless the intent of management is to screw us like they did with the gas logs acquisition
Price target of 12 dollars is possible for this stock in the next 6 months. $20 dollar is a pipe dream.
"This is a fivebagger, eventually it will go back to 25. In Q3, cobas asset managment has bought the stock. I consider that Cobas with Parames, are one of the best commodity and cyclical buyers. Thay also have a great position in GOLAR, TKeey etc. With the good results shown, and the willing of managment to reduce debt and increase buy backs. All the condition are given for GLOP to go back to pre-pandemic prices, or even more due to GAS prices."
Up another 3% this morning. My target is $14.
"Majuro, Marshall Islands, Oct. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GasLog Partners LP (""GasLog Partners"" or the ""Partnership"") (NYSE: GLOP) today announced that its financial results for the third quarter of 2021 will be released before the market opens on Wednesday, October 27, 2021."
Another penny
Despite the mon increased in dividends - the huge discount to NAV - the inappropriate treatment of shareholders there is good thing ! They are a target to be bought !
This will go back to pre-pandemic $$$ around $20 by January.
As per initial plan the company had 1 vessel to drydock for Q3 and 1 for Q4. In their results off-hire days were 59. That means that both of these vessels went to drydock during Q3 and no off-hire is expected for Q4 and the whole of 2022. This adds about $5-6mil additional revenue for each quarter!
They are executing superbly to the plan! They should exceed their $100 million debt pay down target for 2021 enroute to reducing breakevens particularly on the steamers. They are doing what is fiscally responsible making hay while the sun shines.
"went up too much yesterday, need lots of patience with this one"
"hmmm... low volume today... price going up, high volume price going down... make your own conclusion "

"I am waiting for the earnings and don’t own stock, but I think this stock looks cheap in a vastly improving segment of the shipping industry. People here like price predictions so I am hoping to buy at 4.50 by year end 2021 and think it could see 9.50 by end of 2022 if the seaborne has charter market continues at its current rates."
"if they go on with this debt killing, the book value will explode and the financial cost shrink  the smart boys did some buyback on the pref. nice move hmmm.... maybe their tactics will pay off, no (really) dividend but value creating... we will see...."
I am surprised the market is having a hissy fit on this one - just because they did not raise their dividend.
"Sale and Leaseback Baby  net debt will be under 1 bn, i see the sun rising"
