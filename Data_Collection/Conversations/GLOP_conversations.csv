"sold my preferred shares B for another loss, not worth selling my common stock after riding it down from $21+. I'll hold it just to see. please Lord lead me not into temptation with another energy stock, this old moth cannot survive another flame. Good luck to the rest of you"
"Majuro, Marshall Islands, Oct. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GasLog Partners LP (""GasLog Partners"" or the ""Partnership"") (NYSE: GLOP) today announced that its financial results for the third quarter of 2021 will be released before the market opens on Wednesday, October 27, 2021."
"Yearly TCE rate is 82k this week up 4% from previous week and up 90% y/y !!Ship owners who suffered the most from low spot market terrible pricing last year may benefit now and charter for next year or two by 82k fix price$GLOP, $FLNG See TCE rate here https://fearnpulse.com/#3"
What happened? up 6.78% AH. Nice!
"Looking forward to 2020, we already enjoyed locked-in charter cover of 81% with over 75% of our open days falling in the second half of the year, and we anticipate a very strong LNG shipping market, as Andy will discuss shortly. We're confident that the strengthening LNG shipping market through 2020 and into 2021 will create opportunities to recharge our open ships and to further benefit from the market linked charter of the GasLog Shanghai."
"@Dennis and J.D., when/if I can find it I will post the link to an article essentially saying the lower demand caused by the pandemic is helping create a larger market for LNG at this time. The lower gas prices are speeding up the transition of power plants to LNG from coal and they forecast an increase in LNG usage this year. I think the article also mentioned the lower power demand due to businesses affected by the pandemic was allowing the changeovers to be started sooner versus later this year."
I’m wondering if we may hover around the $3.00/mark until merger.Last press release stated they were considering $3.00/share in the merge.Guess we will find out soon!
Long
"We should see a steady increase towards the $3.00. Will have a few dips as that is the market however as management stated $3.00/share in the new merger, all buys below that target are purchased at a discount.LNG consumption is up and will continue to increase through 2040.Do not miss the boat my friends!Long "
"After hours volume was constantly below 15,000 shares so no volume as you mentioned - the tank down was with 4 million shares So you are totally wrong Despite this I am long more than anyone here since the NAV equals 9 for GLOP and 11 for GLOG and will not sell below this !Enjoy your evening but make a better homework ."
Quiet Period — The period beginning on the quarter-end date and ending at the time of the earnings release for that quarter should be observed as a quiet period with no formal or informal business discussions by management with analysts or investors.From SEC Website;So where does Jumpabone Chumpell get his factual information?; Pure speculation! No Facts. Just his opinion and you know what they say about opinions and #$%oles.
"This article sums up why the stock took a dive yesterday, and quite frankly puts forward some serious concerns about the company. Hopefully during this quarter we'll hear about more and better business from GLOP.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/20135e8e-ca85-3009-a540-4dd62bf955ae/why-natural-gas-stock-gaslog.html"
GLOP is among hedge funds growing favorites.
PS. Very Long GLOP-A
"The problem for me with this is that it is an LP. That means that if I invest in it from my IRA, I could be subject to UBTI tax. I've spent the last hour trying to figure this out and it is so damn confusing that I gave up."
I have 6320 common shares however seeing that tomorrow is the last day for tax loss selling and the preferred As are selling below $16 I was considering selling off some of my common and purchasing some preferreds for variety...Any advice here folks?
"People are mostly talking about GLOP common stock, even though this page is for GLOP-PC (preferred). I am wondering what is driving the recent fall (though at least they pay dividends)."
"down almost 4% today. Wonder what's up? 4rth qtr report coming soon, Jan 28th. Hope this isn't a harbinger of bad news, such as a dividend cut. Cause as long as the dividend sticks, so will I. The high income pays you to wait."
Went back through the call presentation and the financial guy projected paying down $100 million per year for the next three years. Add this to the fact the distribution wasn't mentioned count on the focus being paying down debt and reducing breakevens as they said. All good news for the preferred. Can't imagine they are paying higher interest than the preferreds so I'm guessing they will buy back.
"Preferreds are trading at about a 40% discount from par. Huge dividend. What am I missing here - is there a risk to the value and income stream of these preferreds Other then Bankruptcy / restructuring ?? They are cumulative, so the divy must be paid outside of BK. Is there some other risk, other then BK, that I am missing? Thanks!"
Very Positive news was just announced on refinancing of debt for both glog and glop￼￼. Which we should see a continued move upward into earnings. Long-term bye
Filed a formal complaint with SEC Ombudsman Department last week; wasn't aware of huge shorting build prior to his release; will update inquiry on website to look at smoking gun of short build up prior to his release.
"If the merger falls through which I expect is in play right now and is the delay in earnings and even report of earnings date it becomes in GLOG, Livanos and Onassis family's best interest to drive the price of the GLOP stock up as a way to help sell GLOP. Also, GLOG needs cash to pay down their debt. If GLOG can't get the banks to agree to the merger (given their concern about steamers) and because given the boon in spot charter rates I would expect GLOP to announce a good quarter with a special distribution. I also wonder about the new director and if he's being brought in so that if the merger fails he becomes the new CEO of GLOP. I think the strategy of paying down debt and continuing to depreciate steamers to make GLOP more agile is a good one."
"They cut common stock dividend to $.01/per share. This immediately caused short term owners to bail out. They used the income to bring down debt, allowing for cheaper expenses in the future. Hurts seeing the share price drop but it’s only temporary. On the bright side, I can acquire more shares at a heavily discounted price!"
"It would seem that when (not if...) GLOG buys the remaining shares of GLOP (probably not before 2022), the Preferred shares of GLOP would continue to trade as a public entity. They should rate up, as they will be part of a more stable overall enterprise.There are three GLOG preferred - is there a reason why those currently trade at very different discounts to their original NAV?"
This seems to be extraordinarily cheap. My biggest concern would be somene buying it out and true investors missing the bulk of what should be coming.
"Plop, glop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is!"
My god this has been running lately! So surprising after they cut the dividend its been coming back. Same story with $GLOP
Looks like these are the last few weeks we see GLOP under 4$Based on current yearly TCE rate of 79k/day
"took a long time to go back to 5, 1 day dropped a 1$, now going up turtle pace, market can be frustrating"
Earning miss ;(
"This MLP is not working, as has ben the case for so many others.It can no longer rate equity to fund growth via dropdowns from parent. There is a limit to the debt equity, especially if it wants to keep banks open to fund their growth. They typically need to match equity funds dollar per dollar with debt funds, the former gotten from share issuances. Their hand is now all but forced by the market to raise its equity funds internally via cash flow, rather than paying our the cash as out-sized distributions. For instance, with a $240M price for a contracted X-DF, they wold need about $100-$120M in equity.They currently pay $110M in annual distributions. If they reduced distributions to about $25M, their yield would still be a generous 6%, and they would be in a growth position under their own terms of engagement with banks from a position of greater fiscal responsibility. Maybe the CEO will offer a different view this week, but its hard to force them forestalling the inevitable."
"Feb 2020 dividend was .561/share.After Covid hit and we saw all time lows, there were some concerns due to steamers coming off charters and running on spot rates. Again, we saw a drop.Spot rates have sky rocketed  meaning those off charter vessels are making a killing.They cut dividend, paid down debt, making a killing on spot rates and have steamers paid off this year.The lower breakeven even + more profits should lead right back to that dividend. And then some.Consumption to out pace each previous year. Asia with huge demand, India set to double.I expect the off charter vessels to sign new contracts as countries scrambled to acquire enough energy, while paying through the nose for it.Merger or no merger.. we are ducking set boys.I will be holding this for at least 10 years.Position in GLOP and GLOP-PA.If merger does take place and preferreds are left in my place (assuming they are brought back to par), I may convert those back over to common as the common has so much room to grow.Happy Friday,Wrists are getting sore from holding these shares so tight.No one is taking my gains..Who is with me?"
Schwab now paying me 31% to borrow my GLOP shares so that they can be lent out. That's right: 31%
"Holding 25,000"
"The tip-off was when they moved the earnings date. GLOG still owns 40% of GLOP so cutting the distribution hurt GLOG ‘s cash flow. GLOG is continuing to focus on paying down their too much debt. Continuing with the same president for both companies, I believe they are signaling that they will combine the companies and eliminate the MLP structure. Comparing the two stock prices today looks like GLOP unit holders will get 1 share GLOG for every share GLOP. Long term I think GLOG is an excellent hold due to strength of LNG and all the new ships financed and on extended contracts. As I said before watch what Livanos and Onassis families do. They are the smart money."
"With one-yr charters on TFDE now at $66,000/day, GLOP is in a much better position that had been expected to get favorable recharter of several of their expiring 2021 contracts."
Preferred ex date = 9/7. Buy before 9/5
"@don ... none of my speeches have been deleted.I bought in post Covid at $3.08/share so I am not dealing with the same frustration you are. If your lies are referring to the dividend cut, please explain?That was a voluntary move to pay off debt and put themselves into a better operating position.Even if it was a scheme to make an easier a absorption.. do you not have faith in GLOG?They have newer ships and very strong path forward. If they were merged the company would be a reckoning force.My point. Merged or not merged, spot rates are hitting all time highs and GLOP is currently capitalizing. We are in a stronger financial position and have a great deal of backlog.Please explain all these “lies” instead of just posting baseless accusations with no concrete evidence to back it up. Your heading towards @carmelo.I hope you sold your shares at $1.90, you have no place here."
"Abigail Johnson, FMR , filed 13g form, now holding 4 million shares."
"I don't expect GLOP to merge with GLOG. And if it does not merge wirh its parent, its stock will skyrocket as it will increase its dividend anyway. We will see the result of strategic review but I want to listen to you guys why it will merge or not with its parent company. Any ideas? Let's discuss."
"2020 YE Tangible book value of GLOP was $953MMCurrent market cap $148MMShares are trading at a huge discount to asset value! The price of the shares are egregiously manipulated by the distribution decisions of management. Clearly, they are looking to steal GLOP from investors as well, at penny's on the dollar. Investors put up the $$ to buy the ships, then management forces the share price down by cutting the distributions to almost nothing."
"The dark knight rises my friends.This can’t be held down any longer.Strong quarter and strong demand.Increased consumption through 2040.Merger which will only strengthen operating position.Steamers paid off this year.Lower debt, lower breakeven, more profits.Let’s ducking for boys!"
"Someone knew!!! Lots of insider trading going on the past few weeks..Hope for a massive legal action. I owned 11,000 shares; sold 5,000 premarket."
"a great buy price right here, just picked up 2k more shares zacks does not know what it is doing this is a solid good company"
"They are making steady progress on deleveraging their debt and lowering their break-even costs per ship. One day the market will see this and the stock can catapult to 6 or 7 dollars. Certainly if they increase their dividend down the road, that would trigger SP appreciation."
Thinking $2.30 by end of day and $2.45 to start next week?
"For the new owners of this stock they may not realize it pays Qualified Dividends. From Investopedia: ""May 4, 2020 - A qualified dividend is a dividend that falls under capital gains tax rates that are lower than the income tax rates on unqualified, or ordinary, dividends. ... By comparison, qualified dividends are taxed as capital gains at rates of 20%, 15% or 0% depending on tax bracket."" For most folks paying 12% or less in USA Federal Income Taxes this means no Federal tax on the dividend."
"In July, we closed $454.0 million of new debt facilities, successfully refinancing our 2021 debt maturities in full. The refinancing provides an incremental $14.9 million of liquidity and, following the transaction, the Partnership’s nearest debt maturity is not until 2024."
"guys, easy do understand the reasons for the weak after earnings performance 1. with all the announces before the earnings the average market participan was too optimistic, dry docking hurts and destroyed the quarter.2. missed all rev, ebitda, earnings at the first glance very weak3. imo, the most disturbing point, they issued over 3 mil. shares for 10 mil. $ either the guys are really stupid or they bought an contract with some kind of deal, eg one of there high quality costumer bought this shares for change money, i hope it was worth it.Last but not least, yes they have in comparison low debts for an lng shipping company, but other companys don't have any steams and steams have only some niche where they are better but usually steams are the last one in the food chain."
Distribution due in May. My guess is they will hold at .125 for now with special distribution possible later in the year if results continue to be good.
"Yea GLOP seems to be climbing at a rate above the rest of the industry which gives me reason to believe there are some company specific reasons. The recent low was right at the resistance point of the previous low during covid. Clearly people think it’s worth more than 3.20 hence the bounce back. I spent like 8 hours going over all their financials last weekend trying to make sense of it all. They actually grew the last two quarters even though earnings are a loss and the balances sheet makes it appear they did worse. Basically, the bank re-assessed their steam vessels against current market (and current markets rough - covid) and re wrote the value of those assets at a significantly reduced value. By law, it is required to bake those asset losses into earnings for the quarter they occur in. This is why even though they exceeded quarterly revenue targets (grew), had all ships operating, it still appears they didn’t turn a profit. Basically, this company is bringing in 88+mil per quarter at a margin of 30% (ish) and only at a market cap of 198million today. They’re intrinsic value seems to be way above their market value and looks like a classic “buffet” value pick. So I’m still holding for now. My only negative sentiment is LNG and oil just scare me aha"
"Sale and Leaseback Baby  net debt will be under 1 bn, i see the sun rising"
I bought more GLOP-A on Friday. Keep in mind the ex date is coming up in September and we'll get a $.54 kicker plus price is currently below par! If price keeps going down I will buy more.
GLOP just downgraded by Zacks to Sell. We all know that means it's a STRONG BUY by every other analyst's recommendations. Zacks is the ultimate CONTRARIAN INDICATOR in the market.
Missed the $2.58 but was able to pick up another 140 shares this morning before the spike at $2.60.Will pick up more on Friday and continue to pick up more on its way back to $3.50!
"• Under its unit repurchase programme of up to $25.0 million, repurchased 186,313 of the Partnership’s common units, for $2.9 millionduring the fourth quarter of 2019 at an average price of $15.33 per unit. Since the inception of the programme in January 2019, thePartnership has repurchased 1,171,572 common units for a total amount of $22.9 million at an average price of $19.52 per unit.• Increased the amount available under the unit repurchase authority to $25.0 millionSo, my question is: why did they repurchase stock, when most companies do stock offerings to pay down debt? Stock outstanding 46 mil is not huge. And float 29 mil. Does anyone understand the repurchase stock plan?"
"Confident buyers, stock moving in right direction, solid outlooks, and decent dividends? What more can you ask for!"
"So, buy more now and catch the big dividend and lower cost basis, then collect the reduced dividend while waiting for the price to recover somewhat?"
So far this past quarter GLOP was running at 100 percent all 15 ships delivering. We should have some good news this month :)
"Esperanza: So GasLog LNG (GLNG) has exercised its option to convert the 415,000 special B1 class of shares it received against the elimination of s incentive distribution rights into 415,000 new GLOP common units. Consequently GLNG will now hold a total 35.6% of GLOP common units - close to a controlling interest. GLOP distributions may therefore become a more important source of cash to GLNG. GLOP's unit price could also become more important to GLNG. This could align GLNG's and GLOP unit holders' interests more closely. However, this development, and GLOP's depressed unit price it could conceivably also set the stage for a rollup of GLOP on terms that would be unfavorable to GLOP unit holders. I would need to know a lot more to evaluate the consequences confidently."
"I expect this will be taken private by the parent in two years. Management initiated a second share repurchase of $25mm, using a portion of the approx $95mm on hand, which translates into somewhere around 5mm shares as I expect the stock to trade between 4-5.75 with the reduced dividend. Management uses any excess earnings to retire debt or preferred over the same time frame. 12 months from now they institute another repurchase taking out some more shares, another 2-4mm, getting the share count down to the low 20 millions and then the GP buys the remaining shares at $6-7.5 or $150mm and pff its gone. The reasoning is simple the dropdown vehicle won't work and the GP can buy back stock they issued at approx $25 for 25 cents on the dollar. Just my opinion."
"I can't believe it, 21% up today!!! Sweet Christmas gift!"
So quiet here. Are you guys still holding and waiting peathfully?
"Cheers to the longs!February dividend was $.56/share.We have entered a strong quarter and LNG demand is expected to grow yearly through 2040. This is due to the constant push toward cleaner energy sources and as I’ve stated before, LNG is one of those sources!4330 shares and counting. Adding as much as I can when my capital comes in. Still hasn’t reached the $3.40+ selling price before dividend reduction.Extremely undervalued.Vaccine to be supplied within a couple months.My $12,325 investment (4330 shares) will pay me $2,424USD every quarter once the dividend returns to its norm ($9,696 yearly).It’s not a matter of “if”, but rather “when”.After they announce this quarters profit we will see a spike in SP. After their qrt, the trend will continue to rise and dividend will return.I won’t hesitate to tell you I am definitely long with GLOP. No one is getting my shares this undervalued.Have a great weekend everyone Longggggggg "
Dividend cut from 20% to 5% but stock price is cut by half??? How does that make sense?????
Both Gaslogs have a unique opportunity too retire shares at 50% discount.4get dropdowns.take debt down and retire shares.that simple..
Is there some fundamental problem with the company that accounts for this decline towards $17?
"Hello friends, After holding two years, lost 20%. Tomorrow I wanted to sell this and move to OKE. What is your advice on this move? I appreciate your suggestions on this move."
Strong moves today. Looks like we’re headed to $5.
"GLOP Preferreds keep ring, now at about $21 - $22 for all 3 classes.The ongoing $110M per annum debt repayment rate by GLOP all but de-risks the Preferred shares.These now are likely to rise for par-value in the coming months, imo."
"investers doing their own dd may want to read the latest issue of ""Tradewindsnews Today"" and seriously consider adding before the ""ship sales"". hehe pun attended"
"Incredibly bullish news for LNG and LNG shipping industry. If the spot rate for LNG carrier is $350,000, for steamships, it must be over $150K. Glop may be lucky to have some ships NOT on long term contracts. Spot LNG is $20/mmbtu.

"I do not think the dividends will remain low after this year (and possibly some or all of the next depending on market conditions) for the following reasons. First, GLOP is set up as a Limited Partnership that pays taxes as a C-corp (a big benefit for shareholders in IRAs) and has distributed earnings regularly until the Covid virus outbreak started to spread worldwide early this year. Second, there is a very clear reward for paying high dividends as shown by the crash of the common stocks price per share from $20.00+ range to a low of $1.52 in March. I also think GLOP needs the share price to climb for three reasons, a future opportunity to acquire a ship(s) could be done with shares or share exchange, higher share prices make it easier to raise money if an ATM is ever used, and lending institutions are aware higher stock prices increase the ability of a company to sell shares if needed and raise money to pay them back. Third, as mentioned by others here, GLOG owns around 27 percent of GLOP and needs those dividends to help pay for the brand new ships they are acquiring this year and into next.With the above said, the Conference Calls made it plain the dividends would remain at .125 for the remainder of this year so they can use the cash to pay down debt and improve their competitive position. They also made it clear they would pursue opportunities for growth such as acquiring ships if they became available for a discounted price. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE to grab their favorite beverage or meal then read the transcripts of conference calls and look at the financial statements. This way you will find out the REAL earnings per a share was $.59 a share and not the negative $1.55 shown on Yahoo or the $.42 reported by a media outlet."
"GLOG/GLOP postpones investor day, and the stock rallies? The less we hear from management, the better? Lol!Seriously though, I suspect they're buying back shares today."
China US trade deal included the energy purchase. Liquid Natural GAS is one of the top items to purchase from China. So GLOP is looking good...
"When Blackrock took GLOG private it was a 22% premium to the 30-day share price and 17% to the previous days price. GLOP owns ships and can go where the volume is, not stuck in place like a producer or pipeline etc."
"In my opinion GLOG shareholders got screwed, particularly those in above $5.80. Since Livanos/ Onassis are not selling their shares they should not be able to vote on Blackrock. I believe there will be class action suits. As for GLOP at the virtual annual meeting in May we should get together and demand a plan to upgrade future ship acquisition to newer ships. GLOP needs to stop being a dumping ground for old ships with outdated propulsion systems. In reading the statements Wogan said that GLOP will continue to focus on reducing debt and future strategy. He didn't mention raising the dividend in the future. This tells me that they are trying to sell the company. GLOG still has the problem that GLOP is dead money to them unless they're somehow collecting a nefarious fee. I believe they tried to merge and the banks wouldn't let them because of the old ships (would have jeopardized future financing). It's interesting that Blackrock didn't want GLOP either. Hopefully the market will be strong enough to keep the old ships engaged at lower breakevens. That may happen."
"Together, the charter periods in our dropdown pipeline extend from 2025 to 2032 and represent approximately $3 billion in contracted backlog and some $300 million in total annual EBITDA with an average charter duration of approximately 8 years. These vessels provide visible future growth opportunities for GasLog Partners and would contribute positively to the average charter length of our fleet as well as to our distributable cash flows. Taken in combination with our strong balance sheet and access to diverse sources of debt and equity capital, GasLog Partners remains poised for continued growth."
Can someone please give a first time investor some advice here. I invested at $19 and am so confused how this happened and what I should do? Hold or sell? It keeps going down and I always told myself I would hold when a stock is down but this is getting out of control.
Going to be a solid week!!I think we will see $3.00 by end of Friday.Bump here or there but only heading in one direction.^^^^^^^^^^^^Longgg 
wow it has been rough holding this last two months. I'm hoping next ER provides some guidance on their plans with glop because the last one was light on info considering the glog acquisition
"We are up through the 20 and 50 DMA and volume is increasing. Recognia says no resistance till 15.41. Chart is looking beautiful. Nervous to expect more out of GLOP, but holding on."
"SO , I will ask this once again. The brokerages say ex div date of 2/14 and the company has a date of record 3/9. Is this correct? If so why such a big gap between these dates? It is usually one business day."
"Hey guys, I have been watching Gaslog Ltd and Gaslog Partners for 8 months. At the beginning, I had no share of Partners but only Ltd's shares. Recently I sold all shares of Ltd and bought GLOP because I think the merger isn't coming. The reason people believe the merger is about to happen is 1. the mgmt cut the dividend to 0.01 so that this might help GLOG purchase GLOP at nice price, 2. same CEO since q3 of last year, 3. Minimizing G&A as a result of merger, 4. Existence of independent financial advisor for the 'strategic reveiw' which people think a synonym to merger. These are my assumptions after reading 3 times the last cc and many comments on Yahoo Finance and Alpha. But my opinion is quite different. I believe the mgmt is really conservative. They think not only Covid era but post-Covid era too. Nowadays world is like a small town everything is related, especially banking. No one knows what will happen after Covid. Considering recent high price of bitcoin, and unbelievable amount of quantitive easing, we would probably see a big change of modern capitalism. Therefore, it is better to be conservative in regards to debt. So their tactics to reduce debt instead of raising dividend is true, not a cornerstone for a merger. In the last cc, they say 'all options' for the strategic review. And I think it cannot be a merger between parent company and daughter company due to recent rise of LNG spot rates. They don't have any problem of operating profit. This winter is so cold one. So they would prefer keeping two different entities, rather than mergering both just to reduce small amount of G&A. However, it is anyway very important to think about what the strategic review is. In my opinion, it can be 1. merger with another company, 2. maybe nothing or no big deal thanks to vaccine and high LNG spot rates. What do you guys think?"
Why is this trading at $3?
"So, is this just people loosing interest right now; since the dividend was just paid?"
"Another green day boys.The good news is, we have so many more to come.We will see a little red here and there, just the way she goes Rick.India announced plans to double LNG consumption. Canada increasing LNG consumption.USA increasing LNG consumption.All of Asia increasing LNG consumption.Tell me, who isn’t increasing LNG consumption?Hold on to your shares tightly boys, they will be highly sought after once the rest of the world finds out what’s going on..To many people with their heads in the sand buying Tesla at $700.We will be the ones making money.Dividends, increased SP equity, Long, Long term hold."
"The series B preferrds drop to $14.50 today. It pays a 14% divy, (before anything paid to commons), and has the potential to appreciate to at least to 23 if not 25, (over 50%) if GLOP is still an healthy ongoing concern 3 years from now. I am tempted to start legging in here and wanted to see if anyone, familiar with preferreds, had any thoughts on this. Thanks!"
Emailing a Complaint to the SEC; suggest others do the same.
cheap stock average buyback from company $20 a share bought 3k more yesterday 4% increase on dividend expected
Hard to believe this was a $25 stock just two years ago.
how were they helping long time holding shareholders that bought the stock in the $20 years ago and held it believing them every quarter about dividend increasing 2 to 4% and you hold the stock even when it drops 100% first from $23 to$10 when all of a sudden and analyst downgrades the stock when it was $16 to $10 a share and its drops to $4.50a share? how did they get the information to downgrade hat early? how come there was and unusual and large short position in the stock in mid January? 3 weeks before the quarterly earnings? this is not fraud? and the company allows the stock to drop another 75% now it sits at 4.50 why does the little guy get screwed? holding the stockbelieving the company I think we should sue this company and see who knew what was going one before the announcement a lot of people got screwed people that cannot call the company and talk to the bigshots before the company makes all these announcements
"Plenty of stealth buying on rather stagnant share price.Chaikin Money Flow has increased from about negative .22 value to a positive .071 value today-- while share price has fluctuated from about 2.50 to 2.63 these past few weeks. It might appear that there was no progress from Sp alone but as is typical, institutions buy in a zone and accumulate over time. IMO, a positive sign.Cheers to all longs."
"Looking at Vessel Map yesterday; all Glop and Gaslog vessels were working (transiting) so utiluzation should speak to 100%.That being said, doesn't speak to any recontracting but does bode well for spot market activity. Only 1 vessel was available for spot market and it was working."
What is the ex-dividend date? tks
For anything thinking of jumping on board I suggest you read our posts over the last year.Management sold out GLOG shareholders and will eventually #$%$ as well.They do not care about investors.This company buys GLOG old ships.Now a dumping station for livanos family and Blackrock.They will do what?s best for their privately owned GLOG company with no regard for GLOP.Don?t say we didn?t warn you.
"took a long time to reach 5 now 1 day down to 4, $%$÷$%"
Kikos---Please provide a comparison of GLOP and LPGand please be factual
Very positive article from Zack today.
"Many other LNG shipping Preferreds now trade 5% ABOVE per, e.g. TGP, HMLP.Will GLOP-A return to its above par pricing, before COVID and before the recent tumult in GLOG overall?Seems to be heading to par, now a mere 6% below par."
"Very interesting conversation with investor relations today. Currently GLOP common stock has a distribution coverage of 1.1 times. Annual payout to the common holders is $100 million. That’s the buffer which would have to be needed before the preferred would be affected. Ships are on long term contracts mostly with Shell oil. One ship is up for renewal next year and three the following. Because of the Recently issued preferred stock they are in good financial position to take the next drop down from the parent. And, if they call the stock in 4 years they pay the holder $25. What’s not to love about this stock? As Buffet says be greedy when others are running. I keep selling other companies to buy more of this. Very long!"
Might be a rough day. A miss on quarterly earnings and revenue.Cheers to all longs.
market pulse up 7% and this cannot make it to 1%
"Rather fantastic earnings report in my opinion. I'm picking up some preferred on Monday. They've already locked in charters to fully service their debt for the next year-and-a-half. This company is NOT an Altera, which mainly deals in offshore drilling contracts."
"worth adding that yesterday GLOP locked their oldest Steam vessel to a 3-yr FSU charter in SE Asia. I haven't seen an official PR yet, but saw the statement on Tradewinds..."
I'm relatively new to investing and I was wondering if someone would be willing to tell me if it's worth investing a good amount of money in GLOP? Preferably in layman's terms.
they really porked the long time share holders were are they now with the price why aren't they supporting their company
"Solid after market numbers for both GLOP and GLOG.Many, many green days ahead!Enjoy the ride boys "
"2021 almost entirely on contract, 2022 and beyond heavily contracted w/ Shell and other quality players. They have all new ships built 2006 to 2016 not an aging fleet like others. Existing contracted cashflows cover aggressive debt reduction leading to dividend increase, increasing LNG demand as cleaner energy source with huge Asia demand, high LNG shipping spot rates combined with improved cost control shows in strong EBITDA. Q1/21 EBITDA is same as Q1/20 pre-covid at $64M and up from $59M in Q4/20. Interest expense on loans is down nicely to $7.9M in Q1/21 vs $13.4M in Q1/20. There is quality and value here not a pump and dump stock holding will be a big win."
"Why did they announce the dividend early? It seems like a message. I interpret this as 'no merger'. If a merger was going to happen, why would they declare the dividend?"
Recent research memo by German bank presents a comprehensive and positive picture of the GLOP and GLOG situation.
Is good time to buy some to average down? so sad about it.
Told y’all this wouldn’t stay down for long. GLOP is experiencing a solid quarter and lower expenses.LNG consumption is expected to grow yearly through 2040...Won’t be long tilll Earning Reports show numbers greater than 2019 and $.46 dividend!
"LNG war will only increase demand for gas no matter where it comes from. Trump is turning the economy back on. After short term blip, Gaslog will be fine. Still trying to find out what will happen to the preferred if GLOG buys GLOP?"
"Book value is over 15 a shares and the cash flow is still positive and CF is over $2 for 2020! INSIDERS ARE NOT SELLING ANY OF THEIR SHARES at this moment. If the stock would be trading at this price or lower price for long time, one should expect someone could jump in to purchase the company at $10+ a share..."
almost looks like it's ex-date for the preferred's being paid on the 15th of next month with the price action but i can't seem to verify that anywhere...someone know for sure?
"One more went private and now investors have even less options to invest in.My favorites is $FLNG and $GLOPJust to mention, one analyst I’m appreciate his views, J Mintzmyer bullish on $GLNG but I don’t like companies losing money.$FLNG – good dividend, upside 30%, I will sell some shared at 20$+$GLOP – huge upside 400%, here is most of my money ;)I know people says steam ships, big debt and questionable management… My calculation is simple: if demand growth outnumber fleet growth we will see unprecedented TCE rates, something similar to containership market rates right know. Then anything that move around LNG will make ton of $."
"Anybody invested mainly in the Pfd's GLOP--A,B,C.Thoughts on the safety for continued payment of their dividends."
"read the report, the 130Millions was the non cash charges due to the spot price dropping. They took this charges in 4Q to offset the lower expected price in 2020. So the 2020 may not look that bad. cash flow would be down about 20% but it is still very significant amount accumulating cash . Dividends cut is to save money to pay debt due in 2019 due to lower cash flow expected. . this is a good move.. This one is well over sold. The book value is 15 a share...."
"Actually this is one of the few MLP stocks an investor can own in a IRA/401K without causing a unrelated business tax liability. That is one of the reasons I bought this stock. I don't know if it is the same with preferred shares. Glop pays taxes up front like some other MLPs so the taxes are not ""deferred"" to partners/shareholders. Everyone should do their own research to make certain this is correct for them."
"I went back and reread the IEA forecast and found something I missed the first time. Also, my last post before this one is waaay longer than the three sentences showing. Now for what I missed and why I think it matters. ""Repercussions from the Covid-19 crisis are set to result in 75 billion m3 of lost annual demand by 2025, which is the same amount as the increase in global demand in 2019."" So, according to this we are essentially using the SAME amount of LNG we did at the beginning of 2019 and in 2018 most of the LNG handlers paid high dividends. According to this sentence, FEAR is controlling the share prices of LNG handlers more than the fundamentals of company financial strength. I guess Wall street wants to make billions shorting everything like they did in the 2008-2009 financial crisis."
"@Dennis, Yes, raising the dividend would make the share price go up, but reducing the paid dividend and using a chunk of the profit they are making now to reduce debt and buy back shares will help the company grow much quicker as the market returns later this year as cold weather comes to the northern hemisphere. Shorts are making the share price drop into bargain territory again so I am adding."
"GasLog Partners LP Unit (NYSE:GLOP) was upgraded by B. Riley from a “neutral” rating to a “buy” rating in a report released on Tuesday, BenzingaRatingsTable reports. The firm currently has a $23.00 price objective on the shipping company’s stock. B. Riley’s target price suggests a potential upside of 52.72% from the company’s current price."
"The impairment charge recognizes that their book value is less than market conditions warrant. The roughly $150M charge is a non cash charge. By redirecting their div to debt payoff in 2020 and 2021, they will accelerate debt reduction by nearly $200M in that period. This returns the company’s NAV to beyond the current level, which had been recently estimated at $15/sh."
"We should see a steady increase from here. Market took another with announcement of new Covid strain. They have since announced that the strain proteins are 90%+ the same and the efficiency of the won’t be affected. I expect we see a slow but steady increase until earnings.When they announce strong revenue from high spot rates and increased demand we should see a nice spike!Don’t miss your chance to get in at these prices. Mark my words, you will regret it.6320 shares and counting.Long"
At the conference call management projected 2020 EBITDA at $230 to $260 million. The fleet was stated at 81% chartered which accounted for $200 million of the projected EBITDA. The open vessels were mostly steamers (I think all but one)in the second half of the year. Because they have lowered breakevens on the steamers with the $130 million write down they are positioned to be very competitive on rates. Particularly with China opening back up and lng prices down we are well positioned to compete in an expanding market plus I think long term the world wants more lng at competitive prices and reduced carbon footprint. Long GLOP!
"A merger makes no sense. GLOP was established to facilitate the financing of GLOG's transaction activity. GLOG can sell a ship to GLOP at 100% of fair value and retain 40% ownership through their ownership of GLOP, and they lose this flexibility if they merge. The more relevant issue for management is how to restore and enhance this ability going forward. Steamships are little more than a distraction, they have been written down, and trade at a per diem discount already baked in. GLOP has a market cap of less than $200mm, with a substantially higher book value and liquidation value. Merging will amount to a forced acquisition, and almost certainly attract shareholder legal action."
Picked up another 800 shares at $2.926320 shares and holding these for years to come.So many green days ahead my friends!!Merry Christmas Long 
Zacks#1-strong buy indicator based on huge volume of shipping markets now. Countries opening up trade with large backlogs due to COVID. Clean energy is huge with most countries turning completely green..this won't stay under $4for long-maybe not even thru this week..Great entry spot imo and most analysts.The pull back today was expected and temporary..
junaid a GLOP will go to $12.00 before it goes to $2.00. Prices will rebound and the industry will improve. Investors invest in good companies with a plan. Day traders trade and lose everything.
"$GLOP very enticing with LNG hot commodity, low corporate tax, and potential double."

Again: Non movement of Share price clear indication these Theives are Un-Investable!!!
I bought a TON here. I got enough reserves to buy more if it dips. here's the thing......it's good dividends. what is the yield? about 4-5% per year I think. it's not bad but the book value should be around $9 I believe. not to mention there is a HUGE gap that needs to be filled btwn $6 and $9. textbook play. I made $$$ from Express and Party City.....but honestly. those are small potatoes compared to what we will make from GLOP.
"Global LNG Carrier Containment Market Projected To Grow And Attain The Value Of Around USD 15.56 Billion By 202512-23-2020 07:57 AM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance"
ok it's pretty much 100% from this point. i'll see u guys at 7 bucks soon. like I said: 7 - 9 bucks in near future from a tech analysis perspective. like JAY said: 2040 LNG will reign surpreme. there is no other facts u need. if ur not on the train. then u missed the party and u were never invited. enjoy the ride to everyone who was in this baby since the start
"Guess the reaction relates to general uncertainty over oil prices, transport costs going up because of IMO 2020 and glop need to recharter sone boats. I am a buyer today at 15.60 . Seems a compelling buy."
"Random thoughts: Before purchasing the common shares, I carefully read the 3rd quarter earnings report. Reported "" Highest-ever quarterly Partnership Performance Results(2) for Revenues, Adjusted Profit(1), EBITDA(1) and Distributable cash flow of $96.5 million, $31.9 million, $71.8 million and $34.3 million, respectively. Had a coverage ratio of 1.3 x and were buying back stock. With respect to steam charters, they said 'Poten currently estimates the one-year time charter rate for TFDE and Steam LNG carriers at $84,000 per day and $50,000 per day respectively, although the current term charter market for on-the-water ships, and Steams in particular, has limited liquidity for charters greater than one year. We continue to anticipate that the ongoing LNG shipping market tightening should persist through at least early 2021, which may result in further term charter opportunities for on-the-water vessels as their existing charters expire.'And yet a quarter later even after having a coverage ratio of 1.19 they cut the dividend 75%. I am sorry but this does not add up."
"Here's a company with 15 ships, market cap $271 million, enterprise value of $1.51 billion, debt about 4.3 times EBITDA and dividend coverage of 4.6X for a yield above 9% in a growing market as the world moves away from coal and oil. As the world economy recovers from the virus in the next 3-6 months I believe someone will buy them. The parent GLOG has too much debt so they would probably sell for the right deal. RDS could buy this company for pocket change. Wonder how long it would takke them to recover the investment? So much value here! Long GLOP."
Oppenheimer Funds increased its stake to 5.41% as of 12/31/18. Growth in LNG and future drop downs will drive this stock to high $20's this year. Vessel delivers will drive stock in the future.
"The real screwing here was the buy out of the Incentive Distribution Rights for an exorbitant fee. The IDRs shares would be collecting nothing right now. Instead, GLOG paid themselves a handsome fee and converted their IDR shares to common units. There is no way that the exec team and conflicts committee didn't know what was coming when that deal was ""negotiated"". Jail time is needed. Fining the company only punishes the shareholders."
can anyone explain to me why has been this stock beaten down?
back to over $5
It would be interesting to know the reasons the independent commission recommended we should sell our shares to BR? The company has a fiduciary responsibility to the stockholders as owners to do what’s in our best interest. The fact that they are not surrendering their shares and recommending we vote yes is strong indication they are violating their fiduciary responsibility to us in deference to. What they perceive to be the best interest of the company and themselves. IfBR was not solicited they did need to put this in front of us and give us the reason for their recommendations. In my opinion we all need to get together and vote NO!!!
Feeling confident on this one. Loading up when I can. With a dividend correction the next year or two long term holders of volume will reap some big rewards. Gas is still the future.
"No point in selling here, but too nervous to add. Have to wait for the company to communicate."
"They are executing well on their strategy to reduce debt by $100 million per year for 3 years, reduce break evens in a strong market. Effectively making them capable of being the low cost supplier to keep the steamers chartered."
"""GasLog Partners stock price target cut to $11 from $24 at Evercore ISI""No idea why."
I own CSIQ..price was $13..150 million buyback or 15% of float.now $21.This is not difficult.borrow money at 8.75%and retire shares paying 22%..@ A 50%:discount..as a retired Investment banker the formula is Simple..
"Last chance to get in at $3.00.Small pull back today after yesterday’s gains.Make no mistake, this SP is only going one way... Don’t miss your chance if you’ve been thinking about hoping on board.I’d be buying more if I had the capital."
Odd to see the preferred's dropping. The conservation of cash can only help the preferred payment.
I just checked all Glop ships on the Marine ship tracking and all of them are moving except one Steam and one TFDE vessel that I am not sure if they are out of service or just docking. The rate for the supposedly worthless steam vessels is around $90K/day and the spot rate for TFDE is over $120K/day. They should be making a lot of money for this coming quarter.
"Perhaps my honest opinion is biased as I am invested in the common and the preferred, but I believe we will see a major spike shortly.1.) Tax loss selling is complete2.) High demand and high spot rates3.) Market outlook states demand will increase yearly through 2040.4.) Steamers paid off this year.5.) Merger talks with parent GLOG (this would only strengthen operating position)6.) Voluntary debt reduction took place equaling lower breakeven and strengthening profitability.If I had more capital, I would increase my position.3250 common510 preferred AHolding strong and long.Cheers to a strong 2021 "
GLOP has become a Meme stock!!The share price is no longer bounded nor predictable.
Does GLOP stand to benefit from recent LNG deals between Qatar and Taiwan and South Korea?I hope it does because those contracts are huge and will require a lot of LNG tankers.
"@Tanner, no need to take four ships out of generating revenue at one time. Per the 2004 International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water.""From 2024, all ships are required to have approved Ballast Water Management Treatment System, according to the D2 standard"" GLOP could do one per a year and still meet the standard."
"Here is Stifel's take on the roll-up valuation of GLOP shares :• Earnings. This morning GLOP reported its 3Q20 results with an EPU of $0.11 which was inline with our estimate but below the consensus estimate of $0.17. The partnership reportedhigher than anticipated operating expenses, however, offset by lower than expected interestcosts due to a weakening LIBOR. The release was dominated by GLOP's announcementof another quarterly distribution cut to $0.01/unit, which largely explains the price action inthe units today.• Distribution Cut. This morning the partnership announced a cut in quarterly distributionsfrom $0.125/unit to $0.01/unit. With the challenging LNG shipping market, particularly forsteam-powered ships, balance sheet preservation and debt repayment are not unwelcome.However, particularly in the midst of a strategic review and with GLOP no longer representinga capital raising vehicle, we expect a side, and hopefully unintentional, benefit of distributioncuts is a smoother path to consolidation with the parent GasLog Ltd. (GLOG). A lower unitprice not being sustained by yield based buying, means the conversion price from GLOGshares is more palatable.• Chartering steam. GLOP owns five steam power ships that are less desirable than modernships for most applications. The partnership was able to charter one of the ships on a multiyearbasis as more of an LNG infrastructure play. We expect there could be more of theseopportunities upcoming in a number of developing market geographies. While the rates onthese ships may not be eye-popping, we believe the combination of cash flow visibility andnot potential gaps in employment should be helpful.• Capital Allocation. With the new quarterly distribution of $0.01/unit, the partnership will saveroughly $13 million a quarter. GLOP has scheduled debt amortization of $110 million per yearand preferred dividend payments of $30 million. Based largely on contracted revenue, weexpect the partnership should generate more than $150 million year for debt repayment andcommon/preferred dividends. We expect cash flow in excess of these items is likely to buildon the balance sheet for future growth or could potentially be used to repurchase preferredswhich are trading at significantly below par and yields above 15%.• Valuation. With no material distributions, we believe GLOP should be valued on a cash flowor EBITDA basis. Furthermore, we do not anticipate GLOG being willing to pay more than8.5x EBITDA to consolidate the business and anything meaningfully higher than these levelswould be heavily dilutive. Thus we expect $3/unit (8.5x 2021 EV/EBITDA) is the high endof the value range."
"could someone explain what is the difference between glop and glog, they both have the same management, seems to be using the same fleet. I understand glop is an mlp vs common stock for glog and they cut their dividend but it cant explain the price difference between the two especially the book value. glog was trading under $10 and the beginning of the year and glop was over $15, now glop is trailing by 25%, doesnt make sense to me"
"We are 1/2 way to $3, just another drys, going for bankruptcy."
"The Board has decided to engage an independent financial advisor to advise it and management on the Partnership's strategic alternatives. This came from the earnings call transcript, does anyone care to speculate as to what this can mean ?"
This stock will rebound over time. Might not be tomorrow but I believe management is being honest and realistic with the dividend cut to improve the balance sheet. Better for the companies health to pay down debt
"I do not understand Zack's strong sell on this company,They are associated with great commodity LNG. Good earnings, Fantastic dividend reasonable PE. What's not to like?"
Another great Q and dividend hike
"Wells Advisors weekly composite of analyst estimates as of 11/19 GLOP, rated outperform, $22.50 target price GLOG, rated outperform from last week's buy, $16.33 target price"
"I checked the companies holding GLOP and decided to buy. Held by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's Dividend Holding, and George Soros! So if it's good enough for them it's good enough for me!"
"Took position at $2.98 today. Already have a position in GLOG.The price of GLOP makes little sense, and is now yielding over 15%. Per their prior div, which they could have maintained for 2020 had they so chosen, the yield would be 80%. The point being is that they have strong cash flow visibility.Share buybacks make a lot of sense at this price."
I like and own both. Preferred for safe income and common for price appreciation and income. While the common is riskier I feel the parent GLOG is double motivated to increase the stock price back to $20. First by increasing distributions which are their sole source of income from GLOP and second to allow GLOP to make more money from their ATM in order to allow a drop down. GLOG has a big debt issue and as a 36 percent owner of Glop they need GLOP to help. I know they’ve said no drop downs this year but that could change. Finally as the world gets back to business I think lng is the future for the next 10 to 20 years. Important to follow the motives of the parent GLOG. It’s why GLOG reduced the dividend and GLOP held the distribution and if they can keep executing they will increase or offer special distributions in future.
"Earnings on Monday boys!No where but Long live LNG.. merged or not, the future is green for us fellows."
"Don't overreact until you see the earnings results and reaction thereto. I'm guessing that because they haven't announced the earnings date they are still trying to work out the details with the banks. To merge they will have to issue between 34.5 and 46 million shares of GLOG. The dilution will cause some decline in the GLOG price so how would you fell about getting 1/1 compensation for the merged , much larger and better company. Even if it's .75 GLOG share it's still not that bad because long term it's a much better company. If the merger falls through because the banks don't like the risk of GLOP and its steamers I would look for a substantial special distribution to get money to GLOG. In either event a good deal for GLOP owners such as myself and good for the GLOP SP. I sold my position in GLOG and bought GLOP because I believe a good deal is coming. Again, a little patience here."
After doing a lot of research and reading on GLOP there is NO Available-To-Market common share sales at this time or news of one. The only mention of an ATM share sale I found was a mention it could be used in a catastrophically bad market situation to keep the company liquid if needed. If my memory is correct it was mentioned/discussed in a conference call transcript. In my opinion this is a sign of good management being prepared for any unforeseen market difficulties the Covid virus pandemic may have caused. Always better to have a plan of action than be forced to react. I didn't find any mention of a further reduction of the dividends from .125 per a common share per a quarter this year. After the pay down of some debt to make them more competitive when quoting LNG shipping rates it is possible they will return to the dividend rates of $2.00 + per a common share for a year.
"Another day of drifting downward but that is not a problem since I am long on this stock. For anyone that bought this and is in the red remember you don't have a loss until you sell it at a loss. The ""Pros"" know most retail buyers get impatient and give up their shares so they can buy them cheap to cover ""shorts"" or go long. Found a LNG news article I want to share at the following link. A lot of info at this site if you have the time to read the articles. Enjoy, and as always would love to hear opinions from others here. https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Energy-Giants-To-Bring-Greener-LNG-To-The-Market.html"
I agree that if you want this stock to soar it needs to restate the previous dividend of at least $0.50 per year. that probably won't happen till next year when they use a lot of their cash to further lower their debt. but if your charter rates especially for their steam vessels remain strong into the spring and early summer next year they should have a cash to give 50 cent dividend is still paid debt at the rate they have previously projected.
"Can I get your thoughts?So, let’s put aside our hurt feelings from the GLOG buyout.When it comes to GLOP I have 2 theories of what could happen.1.) Management keeps dividend low, buy out takes place at @ $3.20-$3.50.2.) Management does not buy out. They want to take advantage of GLOPs historical payout. Increases dividend back to .10+ and SP follows.Your thoughts?If they do not intend to absorb GLOP, it is in THEIR best interest to increase dividend and resume cash flow over to GLOG. Wonder what next ER brings!"
"......In the course of considering strategic alternatives for GasLog Partners, management and the Board have come to the conclusion that all stakeholders would best be served by an independent review of such alternatives. The Board has therefore decided to engage an independent financial advisor to advise it and management on the Partnership's strategic alternatives. We expect to select the indicated advisor in the very near future and to have the review completed no later than the first quarter of 2021....."
EARNINGS TOMORROW ??
"Hey Jay I am on your side but I don't think they will give higher dividend in a short term. Because the mgmt hates uncerntainty. They will continue to pay down debt for at least 1 year, in my opinion. We should consider first the strategic review for the company. I don't know what it is. However it will not harm GLOP, I believe. Nowadays, the mgmt must be thinking a lot about their position. They must be considering to order new ships as they will have all ships this year. This means GLOP will have more TFDE ships, and a possibility of higher dividend. One potential risk is that I don't understand why they cut dividend from 0.125 to 0.01. Previous dividend 0.125 was a reasonable amount. 47,517,800 × $0.124 = $5,892,207."
Here we go : https://seekingalpha.com/article/4319514-gaslog-partners-high-odds-of-2016-recovery-repetition?dr=1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha
"Very low vol everyday, meaning people just hold. I hold too. Book value per share 12.84, stock value 4.06. Is wrong?"
Seems obvious that they are waiting for the GLOP strategic review to be concluded so it can be released with earningsI'm thinking they want to get this wrapped up and move fwd. With the current spread perhaps 4 Glog for 5 Glop........ .8units
"Looking forward to a very positive earnings report!2020 was a crippling year for many corporations, companies and investors.Last quarter, LNG demand was through the roof and GLOP was able to capitalize on record spot rates.As we all know the world is pushing green and consumption is only expected to increase.Holding GLOP and GLOG for the long haul.The future is here my friends!"
"Opportunity to buy more of the preferred! Downgrade was related to question as to future ability to raise the common stock dividend. This may actually be true due to lower charter rates for steam propulsion, but will have zero effect on the preferred since if they pay any dividend at all they will have to pay the entire preferred. Also, since the preferred is cumulative so it must be paid before it can be called. Since long is the medium term future and the majority of Gaslog’s charters are long term with Shell Oil I see this as a very safe bet with a more than 8 percent yield."
"GLOP trading at a more reasonable price. Remarkable has been how much it has outperformed GLOG. Yet, GLOG has more long term charters with 60% of fleet new 2S high efficient engines.The inverse move of the shares is behaving like GLOP is being used as an option against the risk that GLOG eliminates its div shortly.In FEb 2020, GLOP slashed their payout - so it has little risk from a cut. Now trading at 8% yield.GLOG trades at 16% yield, and clearly the street foresees 50% cut to that payout ... or is at least hedging that way.If GLOG affirms their div next week, then GLOP shares as a hedge will fall, GLOG will rise. But that’s not the expectation..."
slowly moving
pps up and down. no dividend increases. stock has become a bad investment in my opinion.can someone explaind why anyone should continue to hold this....
COMPANY NEEDS TO BUY BACK SHARES BEFORE THE EX DIVIDEND DATE!!! SAVE MONEY FOR THEM AND OTHER SHAREHOLDERS.
Did i miss something I would think the price action would be much higher on this news.
See news story from Dec 3rd; he's talking GLOP up; now he puts out a sell 5 days prior to ER when companies are in there quite period! He definitely needs some lovin or has Insider Information and needs to be reported to the SEC.
"Overall, an excellent report on earnings for GLOG-GLOP and a. nice dividend of 12.5 cents/GLOP for holders of record May 18.Very strong and wise management with 78% fleet in charter and stock buyback continuing. Once epidemic is over in a few months I expect almost entire fleet will be back in charter. Impressive management and pleased!"
Has this name just been unloved short term?Or left out in the cold by livanos?
"""The acquisition of the Glasgow positions the partnership to meet its distribution guidance for the year, without the need for additional dropdowns. However, we do expect to continue to acquire assets from our parent at our historic pace of some two vessels per year."" - 2019 Q1 Conference call"
Who’s doing all the selling? Is this in dividual‘s or institutional repositioning?The fact that the preferred stock has actually strengthened is a strong suggestion that the balance sheet remains very intact and at the price price movement on the common stock is an over reaction I have been buying over the past couple of days￼
"GLOP-A preferred now above $20, getting to near 52-wk highs. Historically, these have trade at and above par of $25/sh.That all the GLOP Preferreds have rallied strongly of late indicates that investors are growing more confident in the parent, which itself is the daughter to a greater parent (GLOG). Also, GLOG-A Preferred shares are essentially at par valuation.Hopefully GLOP has been buying the preferred shares, which is a nice return on their investment, and a better option for its cash than either debt reduction (which is less expensive than the Preferred debt), or buying new vessels which are expensive compared to the cost of its own equities at this time."
"DanielCharles Schwab today borrowed my GLOP stock for the second time in a month at 11% interest, through the Charles Schwab borrowing program. Either the stock is being shorted or someone is collecting ""voter rights"". Anyone know what is going on?"
Earnings report says they paid down and refinanced all of their debt. I realize nobody is thrilled about another dividend cut but it seems to me this selloff is overdone. I'm buying back in at these levels for a longterm hold.
"I finally jumped back on.Not with 2000 shares though.Made this a small part of my portfolio again with 665 shares @ $2.91.Should see some gain before dividend rises. Even if a merger down the road, will see a higher buyout price than $2.91.Good luck all!"

"This company is the most profitable thing on earth! Just let me know if I wrong…The company reported adjusted EPU (EPS) of 1.29$ for 2020 and all this for share price of only 3$ !Investors here are scary of two things: steam ships and Greeks1. The steam ships are not so old, the oldest one is from 2006 and they are built to serve for 40 years. Take a look on TGP fleet the oldest one is from 2002 and all ships are assigned to long contract. TGP is doing well, shares running hot now but still underappreciated in my view2. I don’t like what they (GLOP/G management) did with the common shares year ago and all the idea in general of starting a child company and then suck everything out including invertors money. But in shipping industry they really know what they doing, they run the fleet better then guys from US or Norway (FLNG) – I done some work to analyze that. Now we are in situation when there is still value in the company and the company generates 1.29$ per unit early !So I think the fair unit price may be around 14$Let me know if I wrong because I’m currently ALL IN in this stock ;)"
"And the sell of is done!Ending the year on a solid note.Remember, this will be shooting up after earnings report and merger.Last chance to get in below $4.50.This has proven to be a much stronger quarter for the LNG sector.

Coal being replaced by LNG where and whenever possible.Markets pushing for cleaner energy sources pushing up demand on a yearly basis, estimated to last through 2040.I make it very clear I am LONG with GLOP.I have 6320 shares and I can confidently say this is a sound investment.Dividends will return to solid numbers shortly, and share SP will rise higher than pre-Covid levels ($15) by the end of 2022.

GLOG is an LNG shipping company with a fleet of 18 vessels. Additionally, it has two newbuilds on order which are slated to be delivered in the next six months which are on long-term contracts. Seven of its vessels operate in the spot market with the remaining ships contracted on long-term charter agreements. Additionally, GLOG is the parent company to GLOP which engages in the same line of business with a fleet of 15 vessels. Moving forward, GLOP could be a likely candidate for a roll-up in to GLOG given the partnership's recent distribution cuts and market positioning."
"Gains have been taken.Personally I don’t know why anyone would give up their position here right now lol.We are on a very steady rise and if you have been following the industry, the moment earnings report comes out this will have another spike.Spot rates hitting all time highs and what was at first thought to be a huge setback for GLOP has now been a huge profit maker. Steamers off charter allowed them to capitalize on these spot rates.Looking forward to seeing business plan and what kind of contracts were signed due to the demand increase!You know what I’m going to say..LNG consumption is expected to increase yearly through 2040.Don’t miss the boat.."
No news = good news on this one?
GLOP off today on shift to market perform from Morgan STanley analyst concerned about growth not security of current 9.7% yield.Stock traded 2X normal volume today . Shakes our weak holders who do not really follow the company. Look for update and positive comments to quell this short term concern on April 25th conference call. IF we see $19 that is very attractive accumulation point again IMHO
"Picked up another 300 shares at $2.64..Can’t miss out on these dip days. Soon enough people will jump back on and the price will sky rocket. February, 2020 paid out a dividend $.56/share. With reports of consumption increase yearly through 2040, won’t be very long till we are bouncing above 1019 earnings.I predict a %10 increase (from $2.63) by either Friday or Monday.Do NOT miss your chance to get the best bang for your buck."

The world has been on a constant push for cleaner energy sources and LNG happens to be one of those cleaner energies.Consumption would increase with Trump in power. Just imagine how much more it will increase with Biden.Good luck my friends!Long "
As expected the Q1 results are very strong (0.30 target beaten by 0.27 cents. Actual 0.57 EPS). Dividend will remain at 0.01 and the profit of about $36m will be used to reduce their debt and consequently their breakeven.www.gaslogmlp.com/content/uploads/GLOP-6-K-Q1-2021-vF.pdf
"If you believed in LNG once, don’t give up your faith.The entire stock market took a pounding in February, not just GLOP/the energy sector.This was $15 last December and consumption is expected to increase each year through 2040.This will be back to $15 in due time. Then $20. Then $25.Collecting dividends along the way.The future is “clean”. Constant pushes toward cleaner energy sources and LNG is one of them.Very happy to be a long term holder here.4000 shares at $2.89 average.I feel with out a doubt we will be looking back and have a big smile on our faces knowing we held strong.Don’t sell. You will regret it.Long"
confused about Dividends. can someone please explain it to me? I checked to see the Dividen yield and it says 1.44% (google search). but i seen that it paid 50 cents per quarter last year. so it doesnt make sense...... 50 cents for 1000 shares is a whopping $500!! isn't that a dividend yeild of 50% per quarter which is 200% per year?? i'm so confused. thx for whoever is explaining......
"For those of you that are focused on the preferred shares, take a look at the details. There's a reason that they are trading at seemingly attractive yields: The current dividends are only good for a fixed number of years. After that, the yield is set as a premium to Libor. The ""A"" series reset 6/15/27, the ""B"" series 3/15/23 and the ""C"" series on 3/15/24. Based on current LIBOR rates (about 50 basis points), the dividends will reset to about 25-30% lower than the current payouts on those dates."
"This stock is an absolute STEAL right now. One time last chance at this price before it's gone, look at the history and strong ongoing financials. Mean reversion to $15-20 on this coiled spring"
"During the conference call, it was reported that the book equity value of each unit is ""$13 which is well above thr current trading value of the units."" Does that not make you feel better?"
"Consensus EPS for next quarter is $0.24, with high estimate of $0.31. They made $0.50 last quarter. With the macro environment normalizing, we should see last quarter beat, or 2x consensus, and being to see some understanding that the LNG market is not toppy, but recovering, and this level of earnings is sustainble."
"I take solace in that even though the share price has taken a dip, our dividend is now a robust 43%! Staying long and strong my friends!"
New S.A article..........GLOP signs 1 year minimum charter (for one ship) with Cheniere.
2mw will be Good.and Bad.Let's hope they understand they have a unique opportunity to retire stock@50% discount..While still maintain distribution..
Eps plus .50. Looks like $2.00 for year..Too bad bank.owned..1.5 x eps..@3
"At the conference call CEO projected $230-260 million EBITDA for 2020. Of that $200 fixed from long term charters and $30-60 from the spot market. I believe they were 81% booked for the year. Given the uncertainty of the virus I would imagine many customers are competing to book that capacity due to the need for storage. That says they should be closer to the $260 million figure. Should help debt repayment and stock buyback (They should be all in at this price). Downside risk I see is China is declaring force majeure (means you don't have to honor contracts if some natural phenomenon occurs like an epidemic). Customers like Shell are denying/ opposing, but the question is if China doesn't pay our customers will they default payments to us for force majeure. I believe if China doesn't pay in the short term ultimately they will have to pay because they want/ need the product."

"On TipRank Today:Gaslog Partners (GLOP)Oil isn’t the only resource pumped out the wells in Texan and other oilfields. Natural gas, and natural gas liquids, are also found in abundance, sometimes in even greater quantities than the petroleum. Gas is in high demand, as a cleaner alternative to oil-based fuels. Gas is used for cooking, heating, and even as an alt-fuel for cars. To get the gas to market, however, requires a specialized infrastructure network, and that is where Gaslog Partners comes in.This company owns and operates liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers, the specialized ships that move gas and gas products, in a pressurized liquid form, across the world’s oceans. The company is 100% owner of 15 LNG carriers, engaged in both active transport and offshore storage.In the recent earnings report for third quarter CY2019, Gaslog showed a modest revenue beat, as the $96.5 million print was 1.3% higher than the analyst forecast. EPS missed, however, coming in at 43 cents against the 50-cent estimates. Distributable cash flow, however, was up 26% year-over-year, a metric that helps explain the 55-cent quarterly dividend. At $2.20 annually, this makes the dividend yield an impressive 15.1%. Compared to the S&P average of just ~2%, and you can easily see the attraction for investors.Jonathan Chappell, 4-star analyst from Evercore ISI, sees plenty of potential for GLOP to maintain its current performance levels. He said of the company, as the end of October, “The extensive fixed-rate time-charter coverage of its fleet plus the low breakeven levels associated with its well managed capital structure has enabled GLOP to increase its annual distribution by an average of 8% over the last 5 years and should now provide it with the cash flow stability to maintain the current run rate even as legacy charters expire into next year…” Chappell puts a Buy rating on GLOP, and his $24 price target implies a high 65% upside. (To watch Chappell’s track record, click here)Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans is also bullish on GLOP, as he sees the LNG industry generally as a good position. In his recent note on the stock he writes, “We believe the fundamentals for the LNG shipping market will continue to improve significantly as LNG shipping demand growth outpaces LNG shipping supply growth throughout the coming quarters and years.” Giveans sees a $26 price target for GLOP, indicative of a 78% upside. (To watch Giveans’ track record, click here)We have seen the bullish opinions; the bears are cautious due to short-term churn in the LNG carrier industry as four of GLOP’s ship charters will be expiring in coming months. The uncertainty has not hurt views of the company’s profitability, however."
"Post Covid Lows:June 26th: $3.45 low, rebound to 4.20 days followingSept 9th: $3.28 low, rebound to $4.10 days followingOct 1st: $3.35 low, and now consolidating $3.35-45 since. Thoughts? My thought is that it's found its ""in-pandemic price"" and will consolidate here until a positive world-news event starts to reverse the fear and volatility in the energy markets. At the least, we will be finding out if this is the base low or not in the next days to weeks. I feel this is dragged down by external forces, and not company performance."

In 2010 I saw a stock drop by 15-20% then skyrocket over 400% the next day.

"On reviewing the financials of this company there is strong continued revenue, margins and EBITDA. LNG strong future demand, ships contracted. The previous dividend was ~50 cents a quarter which if reinstated at this price is a 40% dividend yield. Not sure why the price if this is so low, given revenues they should be reinstating the dividend eventually and that kind of yield will drive up the price."

"There has been a lot of talk about a merger between GLOP and GLOG coming in the near future.I don’t yet know how I feel about it.From a performance standpoint I can support it.My fears are that the president will not put all stakeholders best interests in place.Discussion within the forums have some saying we may only receive %75 during the transition.I would say a 1 for 1 share swap is not only fair, but the ethical thing to do.If I get 3,690 shares of the newly merged company compared to my 4,920 GLOP shares I would say that a serious misjustice would have taken place.GLOP shares we on an upward trend at $3.40/share (a solid increase over GLOG at the time) until the president (who runs both corporations) decided to cut the dividend to $.01/share to “pay down debt” and “lower expenses” to make GLOP more profitable and a competitive advantage.At the time that was okay with me.However, if we only get .75 for every share, one could assume the dividend cut was put in place to benefit GLOG and not GLOP stakeholders. Management would know that the dividend cut would drastically lower the share value making it a much cheaper buy for GLOG to absorb GLOP.This would be completely unethical and I would hope followed by a lawsuit to regain the losses incurred.I have much faith in the future of LNG and the profitability of these two companies.Again, I am acceptable of a 1 for 1 share swap as this would be just.Let’s see if management but all stakeholders interests first or if they purposefully put GLOP shareholders into a negative situation.Fingers crossed my friends."

"Stifel Commentary after Q3 2020 release....They note that with GLOP now intending to pay debt down at a $110M annualized rate, and with their div payout for their 3 preferred being $30M annually, their current secured contracts more than cover that payout.——-CommentaryGasLog cut the distribution distributions from $0.125/quarter to $0.01/quarter and also is undertaking a formal strategic review of the business. We expect this is likely to lead to the consolidation of the partnership with the parent company (GLOG). Following the distribution cut and the addition of new time charter contracts, we expect the partnerships should be well positioned to not only continue repaying debt and making preferred equity coupon payments but also build cash over time. Ultimately, we expect the value of GLOP to be what GLOG would pay for it which we believe to be around 8.5x 2021 EBITDA and we are adjusting our target price accordingly——-By this, the Preferred payouts are quite secure. And note too, that the $110M debt reduction is not a mandatory bank-driven decision, but a strategic decision. They can always adjust as conditions warrant. Their reduction in payout to the Common has made the cash flow available to cover the Preferred much more secure ...."

"So here is the deal on GLOP. The dividend will remain low until the debt is materially paid down. When the company is worth $6+ a share and selling for $3.50 in one years time, it will be sold to Blackrock for $4 for a 14% premium. The dates and exact amounts are fluid, but you get my drift. It's the same management that did wrong by GLOG shareholders. Don't think they won't repeat (IMHO)."

"@Jeff Have you got a link you can share showing they are only giving out 26 percent of their profits? Income was .59 cents a share for Q1 which beat the revised estimate of .40 cents per a share from analysts. That is two consecutive quarters of them beating the estimated income. As a limited partnership it should be higher than 26 percent, but they have reported they are using the difference in funds remaining from the decreased dividends to pay down debt and increase profitability next year. The four way split is understandable from the three preferred (A,B,C) and common stock dividends."

"Share Buyback is a Powerful Tool for GLOGAs of 30 Sept 2019, GLOG had $65M in cash. They had almost exhausted their prior share buyback program ($25M limit). For the prior 12 months, GLOG at purchased about 1M shares, at an average price of about $20/sh.Retiring 2% of shares by this means, however, barely offset their ATM share sales.ATM sales are all but dead hear, at $11/sh. But, another $25M share-buyback announcement could soak up 5% of their shares, and retiring these 2.5M shares saves $5.5M in distributions, helping them to maintain their payout to remaining shareholdersThey are basically getting a 20% return on investment, since retired shares would currently yield 20%.GLOP has been active in share buybacks, and now is the time to double down on that program. I expect them to do exactly that. They can defend their current payout, even if their Steam vessels all rollover to almost 50% lower new contracts.——-Unit Repurchase ProgrammeOn January 29, 2019, the board of directors of GasLog Partners authorized a unit repurchase programme of up to $25.0 million covering the period from January 31, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the repurchase programme, GasLog Partners may repurchase common units from time to time....

Does it not strike you as a contradiction that in this over-valued stock market due to far too much liquidity and no safe yield anywhere that GLOPs preferreds would trade around a 15% yield if it were even remotely clear that GLOP will remain solvent?
I jam wonderingthe IQ of someone selling here ……
