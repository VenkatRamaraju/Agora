"As a user of AppFolio, I find the company going downhill fast. Uploads takes forever, often failing, customer service highly unresponsive. They are extremely expensive vs. competition. Would envision mass migration to other platforms over time. These guys care more about collecting revenue that delivering on a great experience. Only a matter of time before it all catches up to them."
"Just got into this stock a few days ago, and I am 23% ahead. Very leery of holding for long term though, since several of my LT stocks are way off from their high. Example: BLUE, now down more than $100 from it's high. Way too much money left on the table."

Big hit yesterday. Was this because investors disapproved of spinning off of MyCase or because of details in the numbers?

"Slowest of all the online sites. Also, worst customer service. CEO is completely uncaring. This stock is going down. Lack of leadership, lack of customer care, lack of technology. Too many other great competitive sites that actually perform and deliver on landlord needs."

"Appfolio continues to be stumped by a basic issue (uploading photos) that no other real estate web site has. Unbelievable, going on for a very long time. No one seems to care. Great companies have great products and continually improve. Rentlinx was once a great site and continues to go downhill fast."
I have both APPF and APPS...

Hidden gem here. More people need to start buying ;) easy money here
Morgan Stanley cuts from equal weight to under weight. I guess they have finished establishing their short positions.
"We've had a couple of great weeks with this one. I'm looking forward to the upcoming reports. I see a big upside if and when they expand into a new vertical. I am not in a position to use their software, but they seem to have a great product that scales well to suit many different kinds of users. They are currently in real estate management and legal services verticals. One can imagine several other verticals that would benefit from a similar cloud-based, mobile-friendly platform for taking care of clients. Not sure when they will come out with a new vertical, but it will be a shot to the arm in an already healthy growing business. Position: Long."

Weird stock ... lot of market cap and very low volume
"AppFolio is horrible. Super slow site. Support is extremely weak, never fully fix issues. Photos don’t upload on rentlinx. Sr Management does not seem to care. Ready to leave and sign up with a competitor. Advertising on RentLinx is a waste of money."

Love this company
Nice $100 million stock buy back. Nice earnings and solid growth. Nice.
"I hear you Dave, 1 year price target is 20 x 4. Funny math & pe. Hope earnings good. I sold in August but almost bought back today. Looking ok for run up this year."

"Keep going higher for no reason other than being the most expensive software in such a crowded, competitive space. Soon the stock will be $200, $250, $300 yeah yeah yeah!!! Free money!!! WOOO HOOO!!"
It is the stocks like these that keep me playing the game. Picked it up years ago on some insider buying at $12./Patience is a virtue.

"Anyone else who uses AppFolio finding they've completely dropped support and rarely respond? Software is also very very slow and uploads constantly fail. It's been a constant issue for ~ year. They purchased RentLinx, which was once a great software, but constantly fails."

"Have worked with App Folio for over a year to address a slow photo upload issue. For over a year, they deceptively, knowing it was their issue, stated that photos were not uploading due to my computer, which is a Intel I7. My internet is also fast. After showing videos I took for the company, whereby photos uploaded to their competitors sites take very fast, but their photos upload extremely slow and often fail, they finally acknowledged the problem is on their side. They have no solution and have told me they have no intention of fixing the problem. Their recommendation to me was to try to upload photos at off hours (late night, early morning). Ridiculous solution for a company that wants to compete in the technology space. I would not say this is a company on a leadership track. They're slow to acknowledge their technology issues, quick to blame the customer, resistant to address issue. In fact, they refuse to address issues. Not a company I would recommend investing in. Leadership decieved me for over a year. Very very dissappointing experience. Was hoping to invest with them and upgrade to their other products. Not a chance anymore."

"I never heard of this company but just found them on the Fortune 500 List as the fastest-growing company. What I don't like about the company is its BBB complaints and D rating. Some investors may laugh at this assessment saying who cares about the BBB and what does that have to do with investing in a company, but the truth is it has a lot to do with investing because consumers use BBB as a source when checking reviews on a company before using that company. What I like about this company it its rapid growth and five year growth estimates of 25+%. The company has practically no debt and a good P/E ratio for a small company that's growing at the speed this company is. I will be researching this company more."

Giving a nice quarterly report with top revenue and bright forecast for future orders. APPF should bounce back to 80 soon.

Appfolio is the best of breed when it comes to property management. APPF will continue to thrive. The earnings were good. This is a total overreaction. Buy while you can.
Does this volume look large enough to signal institutional buying?
"down 14% in 1 month, same as new relic - its a down trend for the cloud spec. companies."
"Can someone explain the resilience in this stock this week? It marginally missed rev/earning targets for the quarter while the market is getting pummeled. It's growth is pretty meh in a likely overheated sector. You have multiple lowered estimates for this year and next year, and a forward PE well north of 100. I don't get how this company is keeping it's amazing premium."

"Keep buying, this baby has plenty of room left to grow."
There is so much competition in this space. Some even giving it away for free. Not sure why this is going up so much.
"Well, when accounting for the PE ratio it was over valued. I got caught as well, though think the company will be able to dig itself out. Not a bad time to average down in a solid company, though it will take time. This was a huge momentum play and now those people need to unwind their positions and value players should pick up the slack. Just hoping that is closer to 50 than 45."

Isn't this company going to get hit pretty hard? They sell to landlords who are completely under siege in this macro environment.
