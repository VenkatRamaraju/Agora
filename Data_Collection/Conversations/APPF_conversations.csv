I wrote to the CFO to tell him of the horrible things I have heard about this company! Waiting for something positive!
Hidden gem here. More people need to start buying ;) easy money here
"Can someone explain the resilience in this stock this week? It marginally missed rev/earning targets for the quarter while the market is getting pummeled. It's growth is pretty meh in a likely overheated sector. You have multiple lowered estimates for this year and next year, and a forward PE well north of 100. I don't get how this company is keeping it's amazing premium."
I have both APPF and APPS...
AppFolio is up 6.03% to 165.01
Nice $100 million stock buy back. Nice earnings and solid growth. Nice.
"As a user of AppFolio, I find the company going downhill fast. Uploads takes forever, often failing, customer service highly unresponsive. They are extremely expensive vs. competition. Would envision mass migration to other platforms over time. These guys care more about collecting revenue that delivering on a great experience. Only a matter of time before it all catches up to them."
Confused w the valuation on this one but happy to see people winning
Weird stock ... lot of market cap and very low volume
It is the stocks like these that keep me playing the game. Picked it up years ago on some insider buying at $12./Patience is a virtue.
"It got a Zack's BUY rating a few days ago, so what do you expect?......down... On the other hand it did perform well for the year and this an be just a bit of profit taking.."
Morgan Stanley cuts from equal weight to under weight. I guess they have finished establishing their short positions.
Up 10 pts on Monday .
Im glad i took my profits a day before earnings. I had a feeling they wouldn’t meet expectations. I’ll buy back in after it rebounds.
$APPF stock has experienced recent insider buying and is up -0.46%
Giving a nice quarterly report with top revenue and bright forecast for future orders. APPF should bounce back to 80 soon.
"AppFolio is horrible. Super slow site. Support is extremely weak, never fully fix issues. Photos don’t upload on rentlinx. Sr Management does not seem to care. Ready to leave and sign up with a competitor. Advertising on RentLinx is a waste of money."
Nice analysis showing several signs favoring strong growth at APPF. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200874-appfolio-growth-story-heard?dr=1
Appfolio is the best of breed when it comes to property management. APPF will continue to thrive. The earnings were good. This is a total overreaction. Buy while you can.
"We've had a couple of great weeks with this one. I'm looking forward to the upcoming reports. I see a big upside if and when they expand into a new vertical. I am not in a position to use their software, but they seem to have a great product that scales well to suit many different kinds of users. They are currently in real estate management and legal services verticals. One can imagine several other verticals that would benefit from a similar cloud-based, mobile-friendly platform for taking care of clients. Not sure when they will come out with a new vertical, but it will be a shot to the arm in an already healthy growing business. Position: Long."
Buy buy buy!
"We've had a great rebound since the quarantine scare. This is my only stock that has hit a 52-week high since then. Slight dip today, though. Profit taking?"
"Have worked with App Folio for over a year to address a slow photo upload issue. For over a year, they deceptively, knowing it was their issue, stated that photos were not uploading due to my computer, which is a Intel I7. My internet is also fast. After showing videos I took for the company, whereby photos uploaded to their competitors sites take very fast, but their photos upload extremely slow and often fail, they finally acknowledged the problem is on their side. They have no solution and have told me they have no intention of fixing the problem. Their recommendation to me was to try to upload photos at off hours (late night, early morning). Ridiculous solution for a company that wants to compete in the technology space. I would not say this is a company on a leadership track. They're slow to acknowledge their technology issues, quick to blame the customer, resistant to address issue. In fact, they refuse to address issues. Not a company I would recommend investing in. Leadership decieved me for over a year. Very very dissappointing experience. Was hoping to invest with them and upgrade to their other products. Not a chance anymore."
"Keep going higher for no reason other than being the most expensive software in such a crowded, competitive space. Soon the stock will be $200, $250, $300 yeah yeah yeah!!! Free money!!! WOOO HOOO!!"
Come on appf
well Dave we are sitting on the fence. That is the 200 day moving average. I will comment after I see how G-20 goes.
"Appfolio continues to be stumped by a basic issue (uploading photos) that no other real estate web site has. Unbelievable, going on for a very long time. No one seems to care. Great companies have great products and continually improve. Rentlinx was once a great site and continues to go downhill fast."
BUY without any hesitation. Back to 90 in couple weeks.
"Just got into this stock a few days ago, and I am 23% ahead. Very leery of holding for long term though, since several of my LT stocks are way off from their high. Example: BLUE, now down more than $100 from it's high. Way too much money left on the table."
Terrible stock! I sold it today for $132.

"why did they take on so much debt with contracting earnings, and slower growth?"
"Slowest of all the online sites. Also, worst customer service. CEO is completely uncaring. This stock is going down. Lack of leadership, lack of customer care, lack of technology. Too many other great competitive sites that actually perform and deliver on landlord needs."

"Anyone else who uses AppFolio finding they've completely dropped support and rarely respond? Software is also very very slow and uploads constantly fail. It's been a constant issue for ~ year. They purchased RentLinx, which was once a great software, but constantly fails."
"I never heard of this company but just found them on the Fortune 500 List as the fastest-growing company. What I don't like about the company is its BBB complaints and D rating. Some investors may laugh at this assessment saying who cares about the BBB and what does that have to do with investing in a company, but the truth is it has a lot to do with investing because consumers use BBB as a source when checking reviews on a company before using that company. What I like about this company it its rapid growth and five year growth estimates of 25+%. The company has practically no debt and a good P/E ratio for a small company that's growing at the speed this company is. I will be researching this company more."
