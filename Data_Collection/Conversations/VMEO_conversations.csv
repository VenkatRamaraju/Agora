"Hold off if looking to buy, as bad as it seems now, its only going to get worse. This is the 1st leg of its gap down, we have a couple more to go before reaching $29."

Anyone holding this has to be sick given what IAC handed you. This will hit my $29 PT very soon and depending on what happens could easily go lower...its weakness has been showing since it became public and seems to only be worsening.
"People are still thinking this is a YouTube competitor. It is not. A couple years ago the current ceo made the choice to pivot the entire company and turn it into a video hosting/infrastructure platform for businesses. They are now in the same market as cloud flare tv, fastly, etc. They have had good amount of success in this market and if they keep going the direction they are headed I could see Vimeo making profit."
Vimeo going public ? 15 years too late if you ask me....
Cash app finally gave me my shares today
Anyone with a brain can see how this will be huge with the changes laid out for the near future
VMEO is down 4.91% to 43.16
A breather on its way to $29 and ony a breather. This will comtyinue to gap down although may not be today but it will be very soon...
"All YouTube has to do is to add a product for the businesses or change their algorithm and it will kill Vimeo business over night. YouTube has a reach and businesses would want to be in that platform. Video content race is over and it has been won by YouTube. Also Vimeo didn’t raise any money by going public, they just made existing shareholders and VCs to cash out."
all my clients are moving to Vimeo ever since YouTube's latest update
"New meaning to ""Speculative Bubble"". This stock has No info available... shooting into the dark."
"Based on this performance, I wish they had just stayed part of IAC but it is part of IAC's scam(s).....I believe VMEO struggles (stock) to sustain current levels and falls back to high $20's/low $30's before settling in to form a base.Why is it that IAC doesnt own any VMEO, yet we shareholders this was spun into are the real BAG holders."
What a beautiful # $29 to see so covered but will short once again should this go above $30.62.....dont bother as the stock will continue to flail just like the company.
"If this stock is shorted again, I will jump off the building"
40% plus growth so don't buy into slowing story posted by Barrons as that data had already been posted by the company weeks ago. This is a long-term investment here and this company is just getting started. In 3 years time this stock will be 150 or higher.
Should I Sell? How low can it go?
no fomo here.... will not chase given the lock up ends in a month and might be some tax losss seeing into early december. gets to the low 20's and i will load the boat.
There is going to be a massive migration to video hosting services this year. The trend will only continue and Vimeo is listed as the #1 alternative to YT. I use it every day
This is still valued at almost $6 billion. Looks like a great short opportunity right now.
"Another company that seem to have as priority to make the executives rich, not the shareholders. Just in the quarter, the cost for stock options for the executives, were aprox 15 Million, while total sales were 96, i.e. 15 % of sales, (not even profit) goes to compensate the executives. Please note that this is in addition to their normal salary. Even if stock option compensation is not a monthly payment, I'm pretty sure it's going to be a frequent cost. Consequently, it should not be treated as a ""non-operational"" cost, and eliminated when calculating (improving) the Adjusted EBITDA. The cost may vary from quarter to quarter, but it's a cost that most likely will show up every quarter, so it not correct to treat it as ""one-time"" cost. It's also worrying to see that with sales of 96 million in a quarter, and even eliminating the stock option costs, they are still not profitable on EBITDA level. They need to improve their sales, and much more their profitability, to justify their very high valuation. I'd wait a few quarters, to see where they are heading, before buying shares."
Still over valued!
OoooooOverValued……..
Low prices and bright idiots. Usually this is an indication that might be time to buy..The same kind of clowns were on the bmbl board a few days ago..
boring
I'm buying this tomorrow
The most economical video hosting service imo
"Serious issue with a management team in its mid-30s that has no experience running a company or dealing with investors. Vimeo is a second-rate product that has never quite found its way, and there's no reason to believe this team can do it. If they shake up upper management, get a better mix of gray hair and tech talent in there instead of young MBA types they probably have enough of a tech stack to put something together. Talking about acquisitions day 0 is an insane move for a CEO."
Need to see this at 30s and then ill buy
"I'm long now, think there's something here though..."
"Like I said yesterday, I bought this today and I got in at $38.50.Usually if I get a quick $4 gain I just flip whatever that is but I decided to hang on to this all the way to the low 50s which in some time could be a real possibility...L"
Back up to $38.82. Price target is $50. The time for shorting this asset is over.
Why the massive drop here ??
Nice little short I opened here at 35.20. Will probably cover shortly. Good luck.
This one has been strong for me since I bought in 41s two weeks ago. I think 50+ is possible this week.
"Lower lows and lower highs only mean one thing, DOWN. This has quite a bit more to shed before it even looks like it might be fairly valued. IAC got rid of VMEO once they saw what the market was willing to give it knowing it was worth maybe half that. This has much more downside to go from what I'm seeing..."
did I miss something?
"BIngo, hit my target and $29's/$28's is the low unless market begins to take a hit at which point this is worth maybe $23"
"This will see $39's tomorrow, no need to buy when you can pick this up a whole lot cheaper soon....you can see the gap down just beginning..."
Everyone got Vimeo'd .... it's bad ...
This is why I bought last week in 41s! I thought 50 was a possbility by today. But i will take 45+! Congrats longs.
le. vmeo is going higher. Much higher.
Just opened small short position at 35.20. Hard to see how this doesn’t hit 30 soon.
just what does Vimeo do/make/sell/? the boiler plate profile description is a case study in obfuscation.
This will be a 100$ stock soon.
Wow breathtaking!
"The unloading of VMEO and onto the public markets is just the beginning of the unwind....unfortunately, it will be a slow, painful march to $29 before any opportunity higher.....def needs a reset as this is completly way overvalued."
"Yesterdays low is not the end. Unofrtunately there is some additional unwidning to do, I'll guess and say the low will see $28's, again unless market taks a fall at which popint this is wirth no more than $23."
this message board stinks.
"Yes, Watching this one very closely."
There it is!!! Took a few weeks longer than I thought but we are about at fifty. Still holding from my buys in 41s a few weeks ago. Will unload a chunk of my shares this afternoon. This was a good ride!!
"Do they compete with YouTube? No, but YouTube is now putting ads on corporate videos and this will definitely drive more business to Vimeo for ad-free hosting"
Vimeo is up 8.58% to 49.25
Vimeo is up 4.95% to 41.98
Trash will remain $10-15 next 5 years
Lie lie
Just unloaded the rest of my shares at $51. $10 per share gain in about 6 weeks. I'll take it. Good luck all.
I guess all it takes is one Barron's article to make everybody #$%$ their pants?
This platform is awesome and spans age groups. It’s a digital marketing person’s dream!
First! Any IAC shareholders here?
Knew this was heading down to $30. Closed my mid 35 short a bit too early but a win is a win.
Here we are with what I would qualify as another gap down....my prediction will be that it will land at $29 unless market corrects which wolud drive this even further to an est $23
Coursera will buy them at some point.
the ceo is a very beautiful lady
My earlier prediction of $39 will come true shortly...40% growth is great typically but not when you are priced oike VMEO.This was overvalued from the day it was spun off ...which is why it was spun off....does IAC even own a share anymore???
And the price as i predicted is $39 but dont rush to buy quite yet bc its got more to shed of its overvaluation.
They had some interesting insights about VMEOV on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Dont even stick your toes in folks not when can get a much greater discount very soon.....this will be in the $33's soon enough but even then, only for a short while as it continues its decline."
interesting analysis on vimeo inc. https://youtu.be/-IKNkT0_jA8
"Continue to hold off on any purchases as this is just beginning its decline, the first major leg was down friday and its clearly not done, we have quite a bit more to shed. ]We will continue to see lower lows and lower highs. VMEO wont see $45 again till 2022 at a minimum so this is dead money and with so many other opportunities, why invest in an overvalued company.....Fact is, they have quite a bit of growth to accomplish just to match todays price point and even at 40%+ growth, its still just not enough and they are already slowing????This only means trouble."
I heard about VMEO the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"IAC unloaded all its shares at much higher prices along with any other current shareholders knowing its the only way they can cash out bc its headed for a huge decline....look at its behavior since it went public, just brutal.And the move down only seems to be accelerating."
Bought this at 41.60. I see this getting a nice bump in next week. Maybe even to $50. Good luck all.
Basura!
Vimeo is up 8.06% to 32.83
This is going to be 35 this week . Buy here and make 10% in a week . This is getting attention after market hours
