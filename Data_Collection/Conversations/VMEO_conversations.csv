did I miss something?
"Another company that seem to have as priority to make the executives rich, not the shareholders. Just in the quarter, the cost for stock options for the executives, were aprox 15 Million, while total sales were 96, i.e. 15 % of sales, (not even profit) goes to compensate the executives. Please note that this is in addition to their normal salary. Even if stock option compensation is not a monthly payment, I'm pretty sure it's going to be a frequent cost. Consequently, it should not be treated as a ""non-operational"" cost, and eliminated when calculating (improving) the Adjusted EBITDA. The cost may vary from quarter to quarter, but it's a cost that most likely will show up every quarter, so it not correct to treat it as ""one-time"" cost. It's also worrying to see that with sales of 96 million in a quarter, and even eliminating the stock option costs, they are still not profitable on EBITDA level. They need to improve their sales, and much more their profitability, to justify their very high valuation. I'd wait a few quarters, to see where they are heading, before buying shares."
the ceo is a very beautiful lady
no fomo here.... will not chase given the lock up ends in a month and might be some tax losss seeing into early december. gets to the low 20's and i will load the boat.
What a beautiful # $29 to see so covered but will short once again should this go above $30.62.....dont bother as the stock will continue to flail just like the company.
"Lower lows and lower highs only mean one thing, DOWN. This has quite a bit more to shed before it even looks like it might be fairly valued. IAC got rid of VMEO once they saw what the market was willing to give it knowing it was worth maybe half that. This has much more downside to go from what I'm seeing..."
How low can it go????
40% plus growth so don't buy into slowing story posted by Barrons as that data had already been posted by the company weeks ago. This is a long-term investment here and this company is just getting started. In 3 years time this stock will be 150 or higher.
Knew this was heading down to $30. Closed my mid 35 short a bit too early but a win is a win.
"Dont even stick your toes in folks not when can get a much greater discount very soon.....this will be in the $33's soon enough but even then, only for a short while as it continues its decline."
Back up to $38.82. Price target is $50. The time for shorting this asset is over.
This is going to be 35 this week . Buy here and make 10% in a week . This is getting attention after market hours
Why the massive drop here ??
"I'm long now, think there's something here though..."
