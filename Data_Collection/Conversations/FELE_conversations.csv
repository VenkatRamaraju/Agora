"I am concerned about degrading product quality as the result of a recent experience. I will only give you the facts. It may be an aberration or it could be an early alert of problems to come. You must judge for yourself. On Jan 27, 2017, a technician at Franklin Electric stated to me that the average life expectancy of one of their submersible pumps is 10-15 years. I had one professionally installed to pump water from my well on July 28, 2012. It died after 4 1/2 years on Jan 25, 2017."
