"There will be about 3.7M births in US in 2021 - almost all of them eligible for Panorama (NIPT) testing. Since this eligibility is a recent development, I wouldn't think we will see an impact on Q4 as much as we will Q1. Q3/20 was up 26% over Q3/19, so I think we can reasonably expect Q4/20 to be up a similar amount, if not more. That would be 108M for Q4, which is slightly more than average analysts forecast. One analyst sees 109M. Natera believes they have about 50% of the NIPT market, so that will end up at around 2M tests/year, or 500K quarter. Last quarter reported 170K tests."

"Q2 preliminary results look good - at least on revenue part. But does anyone know what the consensus losses for the quarter were? revenue and volume growth rate in Q2 2021 was the largest Y/Y growth in its history as a publicly traded company.Total revenues for the Q2 of 2021 are expected to be ~$138-$141M vs. consensus of $127.48M, which represents ~60% Y/Y growth.The Co. expects its product revenues to be ~$135-$137M, representing ~70% Y/Y growth.During Q2 2021, the Co. processed ~0.37M tests, which represents ~58% Y/Y growth.Also expects, its Women's Health business will be its first business unit to achieve cash flow breakeven operations, which represents a major milestone for the Co.The Co. will recognize a loss from operations of ~$113-$117M for Q2, reflecting increase in R&D and S, G&A costs in support of the commercialization of its new product offerings, which are expected to continue in subsequent quarters."

"NTRA is on “serious sale” at these bargain trading levels — when you consider, yesterday’s barn burner, Q4 earnings and bullish forward guidance!"
"NTRA is way, WAY oversold for a business that recently turned in its best Qtr report in its history, and provided positive guidance for its current FIscal Year!"
"They raised the guidance for the year! Q2 GAAP EPS of -$1.32 misses by $0.20.Revenue of $142.03M (+64.3% Y/Y) beats by $11.16M. Product revenues grew 70.7% over the same period.Processed approximately 375,700 tests in the second quarter of 2021, compared to approximately 234,100 tests processed in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 60.5%.Increased 2021 revenue guidance from $550-575 million to $600-620 million, the second revenue guidance increase in 2021.And the best part of all:""The second quarter of 2021 was the fastest year on year growth quarter in our history as a publicly traded company,"" said Steve Chapman, Natera's Chief Executive Officer. ""Our volumes continued to accelerate, and we expanded our market opportunity with positive new data in both organ health and oncology. As a result of our Q2 performance and the current momentum in the business, we are increasing our revenue guidance for a second time this year, by roughly $50 million."""
