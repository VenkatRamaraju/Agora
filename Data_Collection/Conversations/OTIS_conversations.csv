OTIS services thousands of existing elevators. It is a exelent company and a buy and hold for sure. Jim Cramer interviewed the CEO today. Absolute hiden gem. A must have in a serious investors portfolio.
"Agree. Dropped $10 in a month and nobody is reacting. China is an exposure but for everybody, not only elevators nor Otis."
Second post of this new great company on its own
Why is there nobody talking on this board? The stock is tanking and nobody has anything to say about it?
Cramer and the CEO almost orgasmed about the great steady service revenue stream! But only 1% dividend yield? Not investor friendly enough.
added more at $85.50
OTIS reached an all time high at 57.26
Otis Worldwide is down 5.21% to 81.17
"Yahoo finance doesn't do a good job keeping relevant information current. P/E as shown as na, but Otis has earnings & a price of 70+. Get with the program Yahoo!"
I am confused as well. Market should rebound overall at this point. Would love to see $100.
Looking forward to earnings. Loaded on 3/18 calls
Just just just why?
Bought 1000 shares today.Added to my CARR position too.

"Love that the President/CEO said: Our vast global footprint and focus on strategic digital investments enable us to better serve our customers locally, deliver on our commitments worldwide and support our growth as cities expand.""I believe the first earnings will tell us more about the share price for sure, but i am going to buy in because I love the history and innovation with this company!"
No love for otis since earnings
Buy at $35
Does anyone know what the dividend for OTIS will be?
Some bounce.
