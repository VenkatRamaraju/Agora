"Their top holding, $OTIS, went public in March 2020 according to yahoo finance, so how could they possibly be a dividend aristocrat?"
OTIS reached an all time high at 52.29
"this is in the WSB discord everyday, just wait."
OTIS reached an all time high at 52.26
Cramer and the CEO almost orgasmed about the great steady service revenue stream! But only 1% dividend yield? Not investor friendly enough.
This is big but in this market have some other choices. So take care.
I should of bought this at 49 annoying. At least I got carrier at $15
"Well OTIS was on a huge roll until the mini-tender offer was announced!! Let it go down into the upper 50s, and I'll buy more!!"
So are we buying or waiting???
Long here
Guess we'd have to wait a month for quarterly earnings to properly evaluate this iconic company...
OTIS looking ATROCIOUS on the chart right now!! Could be a move to 200 day average is next!!
OTIS reached an all time high at 57.26
"Buying more shares today.Adding to my CARR position too;tremendous amount of renovationand ground up building of new schools,public buildings, and hospitals which will requirenew HVAC systems and Elevators."
OTIS is down 5.02% to 62.06
added more at $85.50
rational profit taking
OTIS is down 4.99% to 63.66
"Sure, buy at PEAK"
OTIS reached an all time high at 53.83
Just just just why?
Buy at $35
"This will pop pre-market based on global production of new state of the art construction, skyscrapers and office buildings."
"I think this is driven by people who got Otis and Carrier but never wanted to hold them. Or are focussing on RTX and rebalancing. I personally love the elevator business model, I think this brand is exceptional and leading globally. Also feel confident with the CEO and management."
How much?
OTIS is up 7.18% to 76.40
OTIS reached an all time high at 62.46
Great sector. Long as of today
"Agree. Dropped $10 in a month and nobody is reacting. China is an exposure but for everybody, not only elevators nor Otis."
There are plenty of Elevator companies around the world. I wonder if there is a possibility for consolidation. What do you think?
OTIS services thousands of existing elevators. It is a exelent company and a buy and hold for sure. Jim Cramer interviewed the CEO today. Absolute hiden gem. A must have in a serious investors portfolio.
Why is there nobody talking on this board? The stock is tanking and nobody has anything to say about it?
OTIS is up 5.57% to 67.12
Don't get this huge move given this rather negative earnings report...
4th post. New shareholder from the spin off. Good luck!
Judy the president/ceo just killed it on mad money. great job
I am confused as well. Market should rebound overall at this point. Would love to see $100.
"not in this. But, look at old UTX 10K and see if OTIS was broken down in the annual report....otherwise I guess you all wait for numbers...although maybe OTIS and CARR was not broken out in the UTX annual reports..."

"I love Otis,but it goes up and down so much"
Otis will have total debt in excess of $7.5 billion (including Moody's standard adjustments) and pro forma debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 3.6x
back to 60 or lower sorry
Starting to remind me of CC after it was spinned off
"Love that the President/CEO said: Our vast global footprint and focus on strategic digital investments enable us to better serve our customers locally, deliver on our commitments worldwide and support our growth as cities expand.""I believe the first earnings will tell us more about the share price for sure, but i am going to buy in because I love the history and innovation with this company!"
Bought 1000 shares today.Added to my CARR position too.
"BOTH Carrier and OTIS move together...more buildings= more air conditioning (especially in global warming) and more elevators & escalators. It's a truly great set-up. With the spin-offs, these two leaders in their markets only get better and more focused. Don't need to be dictated to by the corporate office. I'm staying in long-term.I'm waiting for elevators to go voice- operated for cleanliness and security. Same for air conditioning which will receive their power via fuel cells on site."
Second post of this new great company on its own
13th post in case this ever blows up
OTIS reached an all time high at 59.30
$100 this month? Yes!
70.39% DEBT-to-equity ratio as of 2020Q1. No-go to me in the midst of a pandemic/recession.
anyone have any idea why Otis went up $5 Friday?
Good earnings report. Bring on $70
Anyone want to make a prediction as to when this stock will hit $70 a share?
Where to get form 8397 for cost basis on UTX spinouts and RTX exchange?
Does anyone know what the dividend for OTIS will be?
