I’m going to start to ease in here . I’d say this will rebound . I’ll hold back a percentage of my investment in case it gets cheaper for an improved average.
Net income down by 2% and stock price is down 30%??? This stock price is a bargain! No way but up in the coming days...
Just discovered $FTDR -- seems like a great buy (34% increase in net income YoY). I might buy some soon....
