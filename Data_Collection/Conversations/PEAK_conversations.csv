"Was going to dump this after the dividend was cut, but still haven't."
"Slow steady climb, with a great dividend, I'll just stick around and keep collecting."
They seem overdue as far as announcing next dividend amount and date/ex-dividend date
Good report. Based on guidance for 2020 I am wondering if next quarter dividend goes up (0.40 my guess).
Was not happy when PEAK cut dividend 19% but price has risen 20% since then. Glad I didn't sell.
"Seriously, when do things get better for healthcare reits? Is the whole sector just gonna wither and burn or something?"
"Look at their financial statements Operating cash flow: $847 million, Free cash Flow $1.6 billion and then buy more of this under priced sold stock."
I see $22 as the bottom here. The high yield will hopefully support it at that level. It is still selling at 20 times earnings so I am reluctant to add . You just never know. The div seems safe so I will just hold ( for years). 3000 shares purchased at 28.
"I put all my peak sales into LTC. I see peak pulling back to around 28 after it goes ex-dividend. If it goes to 25, I may consider getting back in. May!!"
"Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") upgraded HCP's corporate credit rating to Baa1 from Baa2, with a stable outlook."
"Down about 8.5% from when I bought. Not to sure I made a wise investment, but it won't be the first time."
"Zooming out a bit, providing senior care facilities is, and will remain, a very good business. From the 2012 level of 43 million, America's senior citizen population is expected to nearly double to nearly 84 million in 2050, providing a massive opportunity for companies that cater to that demographic.HCP is one of those companies. It's a solid operator in the facilities segment and is taking concrete steps to better position itself to profit nicely from that growth. The REIT didn't deserve the market's shunning of its stock this year, and it's a bargain as a result. To me, it is certainly a buy at its current price."

"Now its super oversold... with all these projects in the works, the future looks bright"
Good jump today. Investors probably re-allocated some of their investments from tech to other sectors.
Very mysterious filing with the SEC today for confidential treatment of some financial information omitted from their last report. What are these usually? Criminal investigation or takeover? http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20180319/A8Z8L2ZZZBQZA2Z8Z22NYLZZIKGAZZBRZ2Z2/
Divvy coming on August 20th. Have to own by the 9th. Been owning this for over 5 years now.
"CEO and the BOD probably got a pay raise, reason for the cut."
"Guess, I will just wait for the dividend."
They play it down pre market just to buy it up.
"Janet Yellen, moved to raise interest rates again on Wednesday. Janet shot her poison arrow into the air, It fell to earth, I knew not where. Well we do know and it fell onto the stock market. The robots started clicking, their sell signals activated and now what? Well for one thing I'll soon be getting @ $500 Div from HCP. Since I don't plan on selling, I'll take the Div."
"Next ex-div date is around the middle of Next ex-div. date is around the meddle of Feburary 2018, watch for an entry point before then. This stock has paid an excellent dividend for years."
"I'm usually not a fan of company name changes, but if the switch to 'Healthpeak Properties' creates a positive narrative for HCP, I'm all for it. Good luck HCP longs! Continue to believe $40 is coming soon."
"This whole rate sensitivity explanation for the recent decline is a flawed argument. If rates were to rise, it would happen in a inflationary environment, which would increase the value of the company's real estate holdings. In addition, landlords would just pass rising costs to their tenants, so the company's fees and revenues would increase. This is nothing 'like a bond' as the pseudo pundit cliche goes - a bond is a fixed income instrument, its revenue is fixed by contract. Just wanted to cheer the board up - hang in there everyone, someone sure wants to get this on the cheap."
getting close to long cycle strike price. someone has to take care of the boomer tsunami.
Boom...that moved my 1900 shares.
"Smart strategic transactions announced with Brookdale today... The moves improve HCP's credit profile while being slightly accretive to earnings. Additionally, reduces Brookdale exposure from 16% to only 8% of total portfolio. All in all, excellent for the long term as it gives the company more flexibility to maker other moves. Good luck to HCP longs!"
"Interesting that there is a $1.40 lower price on the new PEAK symbol than the HCP symbol. Not sure which is the real price, but shouldn't they be substantially the same until the HCP disappears from tracking?"
"In Feb 2018, less than a year, it was 21.60; now 34.26; that is 25 % Up. Does that indicate a recovery, new high, or a bad last winter? What this winter holds is the question here?"
Only green in my portfolio today.
"Great long term stock. Basically beat down and has bottomed, undervalued by all metrics’s. Good time to buy, dependable 6% plus dividend is a bonus while you wait for growth!"
Don't get to excited folks. The dividend is still there.
Why does it drop so much today?
Spinoff of QCP should be positive for HCP in the long run.Good dividend play.
Good time to buy REITS like HCP since they are resistant to any trade wars.
new 52 week high today
"I'm down about 14%, but I have been here before with other dividend paying stocks that I still own. Not to panic, just relax and collect the dividend."
what happens with the stock ? can we get any information ?
"They just shook the tree probing for stop losses under $22. Market makers have sold/shorted more than they can stomach prior to earnings, and are looking to reload on the cheap. Intra-day volatility has been rising on low volume down days - looks close to capitulation, we might pop around earnings and dividend."
"Manipulation at its finest. Now they want to ride it up, but greed compels them to also buy it as low as possible. I am interpreting this ER reaction as long term bullish, no telling how low they'll shake it before it turns though. Standing ready to swing trade this on major dips."
This could be a good thing
Going to $16 !
"Initiating position here. 500 #$%$ $22.22. I have traded in and out in the past. Cannot find any reasons why HCP, CTRE and HCN keep going down. Solvency issues? Divy unsustainable? Aging folks need no more LT healthcare?"
"Let's see which way this plays out. Inflation is already here - i.e. real estate/rents and healthcare will rise with wages and price levels. That's already a fact. The market manipulators, however, are trying to convince you that now that's grounds for the Fed to raise rates (in the future, uncertain, hasn't happened yet), which will then raise mortgage and treasury rates (again, a speculation, because you see, they'll be stopping QE, just when budget deficit is about to explode, and the US will be issuing massive new debt with no other buyers in sight, hmmm). Sure, short this, bearish for REITS..."
Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) is doing just fine... Aging demographic requires more of the services their properties support. Life Science is the one of the select areas of commercial real estate that isn't expected to decline over the next couple years. A big part of investing is being in the right stock at the right time and the next decade+ looks good for PEAK in my opinion.

Bring it back towards $23 on low volume and buys will come in
Share price has been consistently dropping since the name change.What are the reasons? It is down at least by 15% since the high.Any significant news?
It’s nice to see HCP going up.
today i am finally in the positive. holding long term.
Do they have a dividend? Peak
Are there any buyers out there?
cheapest in 10 years ...
Will hang on to this for a while longer and see how it goes. Looking for other good dividend stocks to move to.
"Why are HCN and HCP getting crushed today? Any reason at all, or is it just the usual market manipulation bs?"
good luck tomorrow longs...i took a 13% profit and sold at 26 before market closed.

Another 52 week high. Price action last 2 days is a large drop early followed by increase throughout Day finishing positive. Seems some MMs at work. Is a dividend increase forthcoming?
"Nov 19, 2019 dividend payout. Did anyone receive this payout? According to dividend.com there was a payout but I do not show it in my account. According to Vanguard there was no payout. But according to dividend.com there was. ￼"
Does NOBODY want the dividend which is closing in on 7%? Who are the people even selling this right now? I mean who sells a divi stock like this at a loss? The whole point is to collect the divi and wait for it to go back up.
"With interest rates in decline, stocks with solid dividends like HCP could very well benefit. HCP 52-week high is within reach and I see no reason this can't continue rising from there as well. Actually, I expect it too. Good luck HCP longs!"
Has anyone else not received the May dividend payment yet? Two weeks late . They have never been this late before. Makes me wonder if they are having a cash flow problem.
HCP has been doing well for me. I have owned it for years and just sit back and collect the dividends.
Their second dividend cut in the last few years and they are still up two days in a row since.
A person named Günther posted about overlaying several health care companies. I did HCP - OHI - HCN for the past year. They moved almost in unison. So ya really think these movements are brought about by individual investors. The robot in the room does not care if a company is doing well or not -- the robot runs on its algorithms and those equations may not mirror the health of a given company. Do robots invest for dividends or are they looking for quicker returns?
"I believe HCP is oversold, and undervalued. Should be around $27"
As long as interest rates keep rising this stock and other HC REITS will remain unstable.
Stock got hammered today. I'm always suspect when that happens particularly as tomarrow they are meeting with I assume analysts. The smart money drove the stock down today and than ending up buying at the low. I expect tomarrow the price will risehigher and the smart money will be selling. Just a guess.
It seems someone likes the dividends $
HCP seems to be climbing up slowly and paying the dividend.
Good CC insiders need to Rally
So what was that 3.5% drop all about? Seems like it bottomed out and went right back to even for the day.
Fingers crossed  #Peak announces next week exact date of #NASDAQ Uplist!!!Go #PKKFF #PKK  #TNT
%90 owned by Institutions. Earnings beat and Rev going towards builds that are already worth more than when contracted (Pre-Build Price). It dropped way too low and is all time oversold. Its also one of the first if not the first Retirement on the S&P
"Previously struggling stocks of companies without tariff risks have a chance to make up some of their lost ground in this environment. We could surely use that with HCP, but not really worth it considering how the rest of my portfolio is bring treated. Good luck HCP longs..."
Sold half my position. Not sure when this thing will botom out. Invested the proceeds into some marijuana stocks which are pretty hot right now.
As long as interest rates keep going up this stock will keep going down.
Can anybody answer why this would be hit so hard? Higher expected costs? Lower Revenue? General Panic?ETC...
HCP reached a new 52 Week Low at 24.83
"Would appreciate any thoughts on which would be the best purchase, long term: LTC, MPW or HCP or ?"
Six Form 4 forms were filed and they all Disposed at $ 22.85. One did Dispose at $22.85 and then acquired some shares in the $21 area. Not real warm and fuzzy when directors and officers are disposing shares. But they also own a lot more than they disposed.
HCP should be at least $27.
Schwab Just came out with a sell recommendation for HCP. Schwab is very conservative in stock selection. Can't imagine why. Does anyone have an explanation or idea? Interesting.
How do you adjust the cost basis of your HCP shares after the spinoff of QCP and what is the cost of the QCP shares? Your assistance is greatly appreciated!
Great earnings and the major drop prior to earnings was calculated in. Q4 normally isn't this good. This marks the start to a good year

"We're approaching levels not seen since 2015... I'm not big on charts, but we're breaking prior resistance levels which bodes well for a continued rise in share price considering the search for yield is only getting more crowded. Another 10% in the fairly near term shouldn't be too difficult to achieve. Good luck HCP longs!"

Has hcp cut dividends or they expected to cut their dividend?
So by changing the name what benefited us?
52 week high earlier in the trading day. What's not to like?
"Well, Wheeler (contributor to Motley Fool) posted an overly-optimistic analysis of HCP in that venue a few days ago. I reacted to it with a mathematical analysis of how we were screwed by the spinoff and the 36% dividend reduction. Today QCP did as I predicted: no dividend for fourth quarter, blaming Manor Care. My reaction post magically disappeared from Motley Fool on Monday after appearing there on Saturday. So now we investors not only have to deal with companies cheating us, but the financial press is complicit, participating in their machinations and deleting our protests"
"Stock well position, good dividend."
woohoo
"Still about 13% below what I paid, but will hang on and collect the dividends.It is coming back slowly."

"Just calm down, and collect the dividends. If it gets down in the $25 bracket, just buy more."
"PEAK has me a bit perplexed. I understand share price falling along with the broader market, but I don't understand it underperforming. Interest rates are at all time lows, which should equate to better loan terms for PEAK (new or refinancing existing ones). Yield is hard to come by and PEAK now distributes a dividend many multiples of what Bonds are paying. The population is aging, which should benefit much of PEAK's property portfolio. Based on the above, I'd expect some outperformance during the downturn, but instead it's falling more than the broad marker. Thoughts?"

"Is anyone concerned about the MUCH lower eps forcasted for next year in HCP? Or since its been on my radar, the numbers being dragged down on OHI with its tennant problem/lawsuits/huge short/poor divi coverage. Im eyeing LTC (not litecoin) at least they are showing sideways earnings as things settle out with the much anticipated ""cuts"" to medicare/aid. To be fair, reforms do not necessarily mean cuts as the fearmongering left would have us believe. Clinton ""reformed"" welfare by pushing it off on the states backed by fed block grants, much like the desires of the current congress with medicare/aid, as I understand it. If nothing else, the perceived fear may bring some buying opportunities among the quality names in this space, but Id hold off on HCP until the forward numbers rise. GLTA"
"HCP has been having problems with their senior living property’s, it’s been on ongoing thing. I believe it was in their last quarterly shareholders meeting they stated there wouldn’t be a dividend increase because of it."

HCP reached a new 52 Week Low at 22.40
It s div date today right?
Getting closer to my buy range.
"Something to consider... HCP currently pays $1.48 annually in dividends. Let's assume you have 1000 shares, bought at $24 to keep math simple, hold and reinvest dividends over the next 5 years. Assuming no change to dividend and no change to share price, here's what you'd have.Based on a consistent $24 share price & $1.48 in annual dividends:Year 0 - 1000 shares ($24k)Year 1 - 1060 sharesYear 2 - 1125 shares Year 3 - 1195 sharesYear 4 - 1270 sharesYear 5 - 1350 shares ($32.4k)That's all hypothetical, but it's a decent visual on how compounding works when reinvesting dividends. I'd expect the share price to increase quite a bit over the next 5 years, so in reality, the share count will likely be lower, but the value of position will be significantly higher. You can put in your expected share price by year and do the math to your preference. My strange idea of fun."
Hope HCP announces a dividend increase during 4th quarter and year end earnings report. Don’t know if stock price can continue climbing if dividend is less than 5%
So that little QCP that spun off of HCP was bought out July 27th. I had to research it. I guess no one cares.QCP shareholders are to receive $20.75 per share as of the last trading day on July 26th.Welltower bought them out.
Why would quarterly dividend get reduced from.37 to.30. I must be missing something.
Things are not looking good for HCP. Hope they keep the dividend.
!Billion liquidity year??
In case you missed it within the article today....Dividend will be 30 cents/share coming up on March 5th..... M signs as (aka Anonymous)

"TheStreet Ratings rates HCP as a buy. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, growth in earnings per share, good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results."
When will we see $30 again? Div pays next week
"I bot 1000 @ about 10.00 in 1985. At market dips, I picked another 2000 shares on 2 occasions when it dipped below $18. So for about $50K cash in, HCP returns $20-some K/yr now after a withdrawal to put 1 child through med school. HCP is a fantastic low cost ‘lesson learning’ stock. Dividend reinvest, splits, market resilience, thrills and spills and at core one of the trophies in my stock pick spreadsheet of valor."
"26 becomes a strong support as well as resistance. It has been between 25 and 26 for a while. Being a reit, up or down 3% a day is so suspicious. See if it can truly break 26 this time."
Down almost 12% from its 52 week high.
Hit new high today and pays a great dividend. What's not to like.

"The lower it goes, the better its safe yield will look, due to their solid cash flow. If stocks and bonds crash, then it will be an inflationary scenario - very good for real estate and rents (forget the rising rates mantra - real assets and their rents will be worth more). If bonds get bid up in a flight to safety, this will also react positively. It's very hard to see continued downside here besides increased competition (new construction and finding tenants is costly though - why not just buy this out?)"
Time to sell and find another company to invest in. I already had one in mind.
What's with this stock? Why the big drop?
