Divvy coming on August 20th. Have to own by the 9th. Been owning this for over 5 years now.
"We're approaching levels not seen since 2015... I'm not big on charts, but we're breaking prior resistance levels which bodes well for a continued rise in share price considering the search for yield is only getting more crowded. Another 10% in the fairly near term shouldn't be too difficult to achieve. Good luck HCP longs!"
"This whole rate sensitivity explanation for the recent decline is a flawed argument. If rates were to rise, it would happen in a inflationary environment, which would increase the value of the company's real estate holdings. In addition, landlords would just pass rising costs to their tenants, so the company's fees and revenues would increase. This is nothing 'like a bond' as the pseudo pundit cliche goes - a bond is a fixed income instrument, its revenue is fixed by contract. Just wanted to cheer the board up - hang in there everyone, someone sure wants to get this on the cheap."
Has anyone else not received the May dividend payment yet? Two weeks late . They have never been this late before. Makes me wonder if they are having a cash flow problem.

I read positive articles about PEAK while the price continues to slide downward. What is the underlining problem(s)?
HCP reached a new 52 Week Low at 22.40
"I'm usually not a fan of company name changes, but if the switch to 'Healthpeak Properties' creates a positive narrative for HCP, I'm all for it. Good luck HCP longs! Continue to believe $40 is coming soon."
"Interesting that there is a $1.40 lower price on the new PEAK symbol than the HCP symbol. Not sure which is the real price, but shouldn't they be substantially the same until the HCP disappears from tracking?"
This could be a good thing
It seems someone likes the dividends $
"Initiating position here. 500 #$%$ $22.22. I have traded in and out in the past. Cannot find any reasons why HCP, CTRE and HCN keep going down. Solvency issues? Divy unsustainable? Aging folks need no more LT healthcare?"
"I own nothing but stocks that pay good dividends and have for years, including the last recession."
Are there any buyers out there?

good luck tomorrow longs...i took a 13% profit and sold at 26 before market closed.
In case you missed it within the article today....Dividend will be 30 cents/share coming up on March 5th..... M signs as (aka Anonymous)
"Confused....HCP symbol shows 4,488,534 shares traded on Friday w/ $37.53 close....under symbol PEAK shows 4,223,652 traded w/ $33.64 close....so whats the real price? Anyone?"
Hope HCP announces a dividend increase during 4th quarter and year end earnings report. Don’t know if stock price can continue climbing if dividend is less than 5%
"Declared the dividend today, 23 Oct 2019. Same 37 cents as they’ve paid since the company dumped QCP on us in 2016. No raise for three years. Not the HCP of old."
"Smart strategic transactions announced with Brookdale today... The moves improve HCP's credit profile while being slightly accretive to earnings. Additionally, reduces Brookdale exposure from 16% to only 8% of total portfolio. All in all, excellent for the long term as it gives the company more flexibility to maker other moves. Good luck to HCP longs!"
"With interest rates in decline, stocks with solid dividends like HCP could very well benefit. HCP 52-week high is within reach and I see no reason this can't continue rising from there as well. Actually, I expect it too. Good luck HCP longs!"
no one is talking about the new 52 week high?
%90 owned by Institutions. Earnings beat and Rev going towards builds that are already worth more than when contracted (Pre-Build Price). It dropped way too low and is all time oversold. Its also one of the first if not the first Retirement on the S&P
"Still about 13% below what I paid, but will hang on and collect the dividends.It is coming back slowly."
"Slow steady climb, with a great dividend, I'll just stick around and keep collecting."

HCP reached a new 52 Week Low at 24.83
"Zooming out a bit, providing senior care facilities is, and will remain, a very good business. From the 2012 level of 43 million, America's senior citizen population is expected to nearly double to nearly 84 million in 2050, providing a massive opportunity for companies that cater to that demographic.HCP is one of those companies. It's a solid operator in the facilities segment and is taking concrete steps to better position itself to profit nicely from that growth. The REIT didn't deserve the market's shunning of its stock this year, and it's a bargain as a result. To me, it is certainly a buy at its current price."
"This stock seems to be stuck, but it pays a nice dividend."

A person named Günther posted about overlaying several health care companies. I did HCP - OHI - HCN for the past year. They moved almost in unison. So ya really think these movements are brought about by individual investors. The robot in the room does not care if a company is doing well or not -- the robot runs on its algorithms and those equations may not mirror the health of a given company. Do robots invest for dividends or are they looking for quicker returns?
Fingers crossed  #Peak announces next week exact date of #NASDAQ Uplist!!!Go #PKKFF #PKK  #TNT
"Are you still on the fence to #BUY?- Currently 17 people viewing this #PKKFF Conversation!#PEAK Market Cap - $481.60Mvs.-3 people viewing #UPST Conversation!#UPSTART Market Cap - $13.70BWhere do you think you’ll make a Bigger Multiple by Investing today???In My Opinion, 10x, 20x, maybe 30x current share prices!!!

Was not happy when PEAK cut dividend 19% but price has risen 20% since then. Glad I didn't sell.
Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) is doing just fine... Aging demographic requires more of the services their properties support. Life Science is the one of the select areas of commercial real estate that isn't expected to decline over the next couple years. A big part of investing is being in the right stock at the right time and the next decade+ looks good for PEAK in my opinion.
"I bot 1000 @ about 10.00 in 1985. At market dips, I picked another 2000 shares on 2 occasions when it dipped below $18. So for about $50K cash in, HCP returns $20-some K/yr now after a withdrawal to put 1 child through med school. HCP is a fantastic low cost ‘lesson learning’ stock. Dividend reinvest, splits, market resilience, thrills and spills and at core one of the trophies in my stock pick spreadsheet of valor."
Tomorrow is payday.
"Something to consider... HCP currently pays $1.48 annually in dividends. Let's assume you have 1000 shares, bought at $24 to keep math simple, hold and reinvest dividends over the next 5 years. Assuming no change to dividend and no change to share price, here's what you'd have.Based on a consistent $24 share price & $1.48 in annual dividends:Year 0 - 1000 shares ($24k)Year 1 - 1060 sharesYear 2 - 1125 shares Year 3 - 1195 sharesYear 4 - 1270 sharesYear 5 - 1350 shares ($32.4k)That's all hypothetical, but it's a decent visual on how compounding works when reinvesting dividends. I'd expect the share price to increase quite a bit over the next 5 years, so in reality, the share count will likely be lower, but the value of position will be significantly higher. You can put in your expected share price by year and do the math to your preference. My strange idea of fun."
