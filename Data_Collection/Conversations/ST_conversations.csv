"JOEY do we know you? Are you missing FRESH? or the STZ 40 BILLION PONZI ?probably they blocked him or her. Maybe you know Edwin Moldauer? I was reading he caught STZ with a crooked severance contract after they frame him with a phony employment termination ...LOL...I read after 9/11 although he had outstanding employment reviews, new wine management terminated him and another analyst Torry Trett, they cancelled his visa H1b, they destroyed his property , they chase him around the country and out of the country, they frame a severance with a shady lawyer, and when found out, the wine company decide to file civil and criminal bogus charges. to cover up all this and also the cooked books. I see they got DOL and FTC to block all claims against STZ, that they got federal and state judges to block all claims, clearly all valid . The request of the defendant for a jury trial was denied by the federal judge and after 10 years civil claim was dismissed. More so hidden by courts all along the employer, that was not the wine company but STZ the parent company, that benefited from the cooked books of the wine company. More so JUDGES change the names as to the parties to contracts in their published decisions and DOL chaged dates and facts to justify dismissal. Last but not least STZ and US gov aka DOL FTC used social media Google FB Yahoo to disseminate FAKE information deceptive and libelous material about this Edwin Moldauer...... Someone can write a conspiracy story about this and the 40 billion STZ ponzi."
