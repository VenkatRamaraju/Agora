"I foresee the CEO of all CEOs being announced very very soon!!! and then here, we, go.........!!!!!!"
ATI Physical Therapy is down 16.16% to 3.06
"Just want to know, what does ATI stand for?"
Advent & Fortress must not be happy with how this SPAC going public has gone!
Just wanted to provide some clarity on their “good news”. The increase in hiring is likely due to new grad hires as many just graduated in May and just passed the boards. Check back in Q1 and Q2 2022.
"The trend for PT is very strong. Look at the macro numbers. People are going back to their doc's and therapists in droves. For those that waited for theses levels, $3 plus is a great risk/reward. When they report next, the expectations will be low."
Will hit 2.5
How low will this stock go?
Buy this stock up ….private equity firm Advent International one of the world’s best has 2 board seats and are managing this play …they are looking to reap profits not losses …hold tight - should rip after CEO announcement …
Does ATI have any chance to get back to double digits in the long term?
