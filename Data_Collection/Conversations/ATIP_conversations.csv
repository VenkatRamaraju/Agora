"In addition to SEC inquiry (roll out from SPAC), Justice DEPT. nowlooking into potential fraud violations (as per message board).Senior management must be fired."
"In case anyone here does not work with health care people. The turn over rate is high across the board everywhere. I work around a staff of 40 nurses and 25% turn over every year. This company and its stock is going to be just fine. I know I got in low, so I didn’t take the big hit this week. At $4 and the target is $5 in a year is a 20% gain in the year. A couple of ER and more positive is going to come from this company."
$ATIP to the moon massive short now
Let’s see 4.50 today people :). See the growth stock grow
my FAII options are not converting to ATIP..any idea?
"David Cabot, has retained Cox & Stone, to explorelegal action against each board member of ATIPon an individual basis. Cox & Stone has confirmedSEC rules and regulations were violated on spin outfrom SPAC. The foregoing as per the Cabot Letter."
"I was doing my DD since the earnings call to see if theres an opportunity here... Financials are ok, debt is large but OK with current cashflow, history of the company is good and theyre profitable in a sector which will not see downside in demand for decades if ever... But what bothers me and why I wont take a position here is the management... When I checked the board - from 8 directors only one has more than 2 year history with the company, thats what I see as a main problem. I cant put my money on people who havent built this and came here 2 years ago with no ties to the prior development... A very bad sign. Good luck to all holders."
"Boy, I hope Uncle Bruce is right about this stock..."
"Well, at least I bought lower than the current share price #$%$ show debuted."
Analysts predict between $12-14 a share - why does it keep dropping?
Fear of this being a Stink SPAC is why I actually sold at $10 before it went public. I took a 50 cent per share loss. One look at the chart tells you people knew this was a real torpedo. People are now losing billions on Stinky SPACs. My advice would be to join the lawsuits and stay clear of SPACs.
"Uncle Bruce hype man convinced me to buy, should I keep buying or just hodl"
averagd 3.8$ I hope to see 10$ in 3 o 4 years
I lost alot of money thanks Uncle Bruce...I'll just hold this garbage since my calls expire in November anyway. losing another 200$ at this point makes no diff.
CEO must be fired. Maybe prosecuted.
ATI Physical Therapy is down 15.25% to 4.00
ATI Physical Therapy is up 6.23% to 8.53
This is so disappointing.
my 3 x 2.45 calls for Nov 19th now worth .05. that's ~750 now worth 15$. thank ya Uncle Brucey!
What an overshoot.. chsnce to buy solid company at 70% discount
I agree with Robert.
ATIP is down 5.69% to 9.44
Expecting a drop tomorrow
"never make an investment based on someone else's DD. I wasnt interested in atip but bought it cuz I figured hey, uncle bruce knows more than me. but it didnt seem attractive tbh. with covid etc, people unlikely to need pt for some time. then, I did some more reading. on reddit many therapists complain first hand about working for atip, how difficult it is dealing with them and how they get underpaid. I though about selling this junk last week but I was down a couple hundred and thought why not wait. big mistake. do your dd and trust your gut.."
Something nasty is brewing under the economy and this ATIP report is a hint. People are tired of #$%$ wages. Something has to give.
what was Labeed Diab's bonus and severance package?
Such a overreacting from market. This will be back soon. Wish had more cash to buy under $6. GL
Advent & Fortress must not be happy with how this SPAC going public has gone!
ATI Physical Therapy is down 6.82% to 8.20
Tomorrow at least 3.50. Golden opportunity to buy now
Wish I bought more when it dropped below 3
I’m going to sue uncle bruce next
Hopefully the rotation to growth stock would start and help boost SPAC prices as well…just saying…
first quarterly report on Monday since becoming a public company! buy or sell today?
What a SPACtacular collapse!
Analysts just dropped target to $5 - what a scam SPAC/IPO Release!
"Mr. Diab, my Grandchildren, have lostsome of their college fund on your stock.Your lack of ethics, in not disclosing Material Facts,is a Criminal Act."
"Advent and Fortress made this happen and are on the Board, is anybody really expecting any C level Management changes"
"I might get out. http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-rise-of-spacs-ipo-disruptors-or.htmlBasically Aswath is a well known economics and investing professor. The sum of the article above is, you can make money off spacs befforee they go public when there is hype. but the data shows after going public, most spac investors lose money."
Yet another spac scam to add to Nikola and RIDE and even RMO. Lofty projections with nothing to back them up.
woof
a far better spac was CCIV. but uncle bruce refused to talk about it. makes you wonder. cciv is a good company with a great ceo and happy employees. unlike atip
"Mr. Habib, how many Yachts do U need?"
Is this the bottom?
"Biab is a loser, he must be fired now."
"The Annual meeting will be very lively.Diab, better be history by then.The board a group of losers and con men."
Does anyone have info on atipws?
"it's going out of business sell off ... here's the deal, if this was a traditional IPO, it won't tank like this because it won't be overvalued like most SPACs do. ATIP is the nail in the coffin for SPAC investing. Money losing QSI with no revs until 2025 is a much better SPAC."
halted hahahahah
"David Cabot, is doing a detailed report onSEC violations, and alleged Fraud in not disclosingMaterial Facts, prior to roll out from SPAC.Packages of completed report will be hand deliveredto NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and CNBC.Cabot is expected to appear on Mad Money."
"Potential Fraud, by non disclosure of Material Facts.THIS MAYBE BE ACCEPTABLE IN CAIRO; this is the United Statesof America. Mr. Diab should leave the USA now."
"Received several emails from Laws firms initiatingclass action lawsuits against ATIP for not disclosingMaterial Facts, prior to roll out from SPAC."
Holding strong ya’ll
Should CEO go to jail after this report? Sickening.
Why the big difference between shares outstanding of 207 million and float at about 13 million. Is the difference restricted shares owned by insiders and SPAC that can not be sold until a lock up period is over?
What was Cedric's severance package?
what is the news?
#$%$ this spac......
"The question is when will bag holders see 9 again, possibly 9 years from now"
"Clement Company, has contacted Herschel Walker,about his joining board of ATIP. Clement Company,seeking two seats on ATIP board. Clement hoping tomeet face to face with this sports Icon."
"We are awarding Mr. Diab, the Angelo Mozillo (Countrywide Shame) award,for hurting elderly investors such as this writer.How much money does Diab need. Diab, is the poor man's Trevor Milton."
that's a big oof
lololol
"Clement Company, will be asking for two board seats.Peter Bowman EX VP.; of Clement Company, is working to add a significantposition of shares and be ready to have voting power."
SEC will be auditing ATIP as per Senator Elizabeth Warren's staff.Did the Pharaoh and his team break laws?
ATI Physical Therapy is down 43.05% to 4.75
What a comeback
"Just looking at this opportunity, the long term I can not see a down side. Founded back in 1996, so 25 year old company just goes public. The long term hold is 100% gain in the next year."
stupid longs invested in this trash got what they deserved. down 19% today to $3.82. This piece of trash has been on a downward trajectory ever since the SPAC merger. too funny. lol
"Wow, 1.5 Billion in Dept..Arent they suposed to make money and not burn it?"
Warrants are separating from stock movement and moving up. Stock has hit bottom and recovered. Similar thing happened to $ATIP and itRecovered a decent amount over the last couple weeks. And it’s not half the potential $KPLT is. Let’s F’N go here boys. This is our PayPal moment.
U wnt get a better price buy n hold its just a matter of time b4 this explodes
A 40 percent sell off is a huge over reaction. Its still even profitable
Should Fortress take any ownership for this? Didnt they get a seat on the board?
Time for the run up to red 05 for the day
"The fact that PT's are bolting out of this company for competitors paying higher rates does not bode well...75%+ of reimbursement comes from Medicare patients, and those are low, fixed rates...if they can't make money today how will they if they have to increase PT pay by 10-15% to keep their staff?"
Welcome to the SPAC world. Bend Over. :-)
"How many Yachts, does Diab need?How many Mansions are enough Mr. Diab?What qualifies U, to be CEO?Ross Perot, voiced two ways to judge a man:Military Record and record of being a Family Man.West Point would probably provide Mr. Diab's military record,"
ATI Physical Therapy is down 6.57% to 7.97
another bad day for $atip
"thanks alot ""uncle"" bruce. classic case of shovel sellers to gold rush seekers."
$ATIP squeezes
That HR problem getting fixed for $800M worth of reasons
"I invested some of my Grandchildren's College Fund,in this Loser. It appears that SEC rules and regulations (per David Cabot)were not adhered to. Full Disclosure of Material Facts is mandatory."
Uncle Bruce - super pumper - nice work
"How many Yachts do your require Mr, Habib?Not disclosing material facts when rolling out of SPAC,is a criminal offense."
"Paul Barnard Esq; is focused on one large class action lawsuitfor alleged Fraud by ATIP board in not disclosing Material Factsprior to exiting SPAC. Barnard has privately voiced that CEOAnwar Habid, could be barred for life from being an officer of a Public Concern!"
"the CEO is an Arab ... to be politically correct, I should say Arabic ... fire him"
Major support at 0.73 cents
makes me wonder about uncle bruce. I bought this solely on his recommendation. there goes 1000$ on 3 calls I had for November. should I continue to hold? company seems like #$%$ covid is going to get worse. aTIP therapists talk garbage about the company on reddit. this company overall seems like garbage.
Diab will be prosecuted as to the full extent of the law.
eh im buying today. Best time to buy is when other people with poor understanding are selling
"Based on SPAC evaluation, changes in executives must happen now!"
ATI Physical Therapy is up 5.03% to 9.40
"I am not a holder here yet... will be slowly adding during next two weeks up to 12k shares if it goes well but what I see here...Company is well set up on the market, history proves they do well, price/sales close to 1... I dont like the 600mln debt but from the cashflow perspective its ok.Market is growing double digits... physical therapy is a type of business that can never be replaced and never face declining demand.Management managed the company for 25 years without dealing with this public nonsense... I guess it was not intentional and with labor market volatility right now its hard to calculate financial forecasts.At this price I see it as a good pick - working business with good prospects and history. Kinda a pick Buffet would like :-)Good luck to ya all"
Can anyone tell me how much Advent paid for ATIP back in 2016
"Are those Q1 earnings of $ 0,9 a share right?"
How low will this stock go?
"Rick Colossimo, President of of General Concrete Supply Company,very upset that employee Retirement Fund lost a bundle,on non disclosure by Diab, on roll out from SPAC, exploring allLegal Options to send Diab back to Cairo."
ATI Physical Therapy is down 15.15% to 3.08
This company is a disaster - there will be several lawsuits before this is sorted out
Omg ATIP…….
Labeed out as CEO!
