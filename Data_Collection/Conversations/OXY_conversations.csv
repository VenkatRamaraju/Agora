Looks like Oxy 20-day avg should move up to cross the 50 in about 2 days…..should bring in some more buying.
You huff and puff all you want but the price of fossil fuels is going to continue to rise regardless of the covid and lockdown spinners. People even in lockdowns need heat for the winter and solar panels and wind turbines simply can not do the job. If you don't believe me ask Texans.
One of these days OXY will go up $3 IN a single session and never look back.
"Oil at the highest levels it’s been at in 6 years and OXY is down $50 from its five year highs. Looks pretty bullish to me  and yes, I know about the debt, blah blah blah. This will be a monster gap up. Balance sheet is getting better by the day."
Do you think the Liberal Media could play up the Delta Variant card any more than they are. They only talk about how bad it is every 30 seconds now??????
"GOM production around 130mboed, offline around 10 days, let's assume, that's 84 million loss.Im long OXY, just sad to see the loss, i was expecting another record for Q3, it looks like it wont happen"
W better not complaining today. Hopefully he didn't sell his position yesterday lol. Oxy to $30 should be before EOY. Usually September is a nasty month for oil and the market in general but usually the market does the opposite of the direction you think it will go.
Another 3b cash flow this quarter to pay down debt. Minimum $45 next April with long-term debt under 25b.$13b cash flow per yr assuming WTI at $66 is a no brainer investment.
I hope we can hold these pre-market gains. I can't remember a time of late we had back to back gains. Has me quite fired up this morning! GL to all!
"Viki queen of modern OIL….remember this, in Q4 2022, this company will generate 12 bill FCF, and have 20 bill of dept…..Generation opportunity"
WTI just lost most all gains.
IDA is causing refineries to be out for weeks. There was already a murder at a gas station. Prices will surpass 100 with over 3 million bpd offline. Scary...
"W, interesting point you bring up. When someone figures out just what point that is we will get back to you."
oil price is up nicely today guys so OXY & CVX! Hurricane season has just started with Ida and Larry is on its way!
"W, you know that Oxy is money at $70 oil so why are you so upset. This will move up after next earnings. You will be fine."
If Oil is in such short supply why did the Saudi's cut the price of crude to Asia?????
***** Henry Hub NG @ $5.03 this morning....... not a bad price to see with the winter heating season about to get underway...........*****deepsub
480K school busses to hit the road next week. Each consumes 6.2 miles to a gallon. You do the math. And diesel is made from oil
If OPEC delays planned increases by a month or 2 OXY over $30. I say pray

"W, what did I tell you? Stop worrying about daily fluctuations. Oxy will be above $30 in a year time."
"Remember Citi said OXY could cut debt by 50% in two years with oil at $55....If OXY gets debt to 50% our free cash flow will be $8Billion + and we have under 1Billion shares, this stock will be $75+ easy"
"***** Crude oil has gone green,....... now that it's inching up above the flat line, what could be the excuse for oil patch stocks to still be in the toilet today??? Hmmmmm.....*****deepsub"

"Excerpt from the Oil Price piece ""Why U.S. Shale Companies are So Undervalued"" >>>>""As an example let’s compare the cash generation between Occidental Petroleum, (NYSE: OXY) and NextEra Energy, (NYSE: NEE). One company produces oil and gas primarily, and the other participates in the “Green Energy” sector building windmill farms for electricity generation.ShaleAuthor’s research/company filingsInvestors in NextEra are looking past a mountain of debt to award the company a capitalization of $168 bn at the current share price of ~$85. Some of this is understandable given the figurative, “wind at the back,” of this industry. Windfarms could be the “tulip craze” of the modern era, and are endorsed and sanctioned by local, state, and the Federal government. However, if dividend security is analyzed using conventional metrics in the table above, investors in OXY should be sleeping much better at night, than those holding shares of NEE.At some point, investors in NEE may have to come to grips with the fact that as attractive as this sector is socially, it is not generating returns sufficient to maintain generous dividends being offered.Analysts are beginning to take note of the cash generation being seen in the American upstream oil industry. Scott Gruber of Citibank, (NYSE:CITI) recently put out a bullish note on OXY, citing the company’s cash flow yield of ~13% for 2022. His short-term estimate for the stock includes growth to ~$35 per share.When all of this is considered you can understand why execs at OXY are anxious to finish their deleveraging over the next year. Vicki Hollub, CEO at OXY commented on the coming shift in capital allocation priorities once debt targets are insight-“We have significantly de-risked our balance sheet with the successful completion of our recent debt tenders, and this marks the next stage of our deleveraging effort as we work to further reduce debt and to lower our breakeven.While we still have work to do before transitioning to the next stage of our cash flow priorities, including returning additional capital to shareholders, we're confident that the steps we have completed to date and the strong operational performance that we continue to deliver will accelerate our progress.”"
"***** Not that I am a follower of Zack's....... but I am a long-term reader and sponge for information over the years........ and like a gold miner knee deep in a Sierra Madre Creek, I go through 30 pans a pay dirt to yield only one pan worth of good info. So today, after about a year and a half...... Zach's finally lifted the rating for OXY...... from a #3(hold).....to a #2 (buy)......Hmmmmm. FWIW*****deepsub"
***** NEWS......OXY reports that seven out of 10 platforms in the GOM have halted production even though they have not experienced any damage from the hurricane. READ THE DETAILS on Yahoo news....... this is just a temporary production halt..... the chem business is in the process of ramping back up in Louisiana as power being restored....... so within a week or so Force measure will be likely canceled.*****deepsub
"And to me it looks like the upside of the warrants is getting larger in relation to that of the shares. The market is not appreciating the leverage that they offer, or their lower volatility in relation to shorter term options."
***** OXY is trying its best in all this confusion of oil and gas pricing...... to be a green machine today! Maybe this has just been a early morning head fake from those that know that EIA #s will be good....... and some are noticing that 7-year high NG price also the last couple of days.*****deepsub
Covid-19 Delta variant is peaking. Oil stocks will move soon to a new level
"As I’ve pointed out before; If you think OXY is ever going to rally, I recommend you look at BP and Chevron. Both are buying back huge amounts of shares and have excellent earnings and a huge dividend and they are flat dead! BP unchanged for 18 months in the greatest bull market in oil, nat gas and the broad market. If you told me 18 months ago oil would rally 150%, natural gas 200% in the broad market 50% in oil stocks would be mostly unchanged ... well I don’t know what to say"
"Too bad Oxy stock is dropping at the same time other oil companies are returning extra cash as either dividend increases or buy back of stock.....Oxy must continue to pay out the 32 billion it still owes and it will take years to return to a small dividend increase.....all because of vicki......Her name is mud on wall street by the way.....so all those who think that when oil eventually skyrockets, oxy will not make anywhere near the increase the other oil companies will have simply because of the massive debt vicki incurred....."
***** (vbg) Only 90 minutes into the trading day....... and we're about @ 1/2 average daily volume already....... OXY is under accumulation. Could be a combination of the CITI upgrade and the bump up in relative strength number to 84 from 78...........Yahoo shows analyst consensus rating the same as XOM lately.......@ 2.7*****deepsub
"Current pps appears as if WTI oil is going back to $40 or below. No way OPEC let’s that happen. What a wonderful second chance for those who missed out. If I had FAANG, I’d sell it all and buy oil"
Another 3b debt reduction next month will send oxy to 30. Easy money! lol
OXY has disgusting performance one of the worst oil stocks in the sector performance wise!
nat gas at these levels is like oil at a hundred for oxy and others...a big part of their daily production is nat gas
Happy to see W happy and relaxed. How many times did I have to tell him buy and come back in December???
"occidental oil is a BARRIER PRICE CAPPED oil stock. OCCIDENTAL OIL PRICE CAP IS SET TO 33 US DOLLAR UNTIL 2027 by OIL STOCK BROKERAGES. IF YOU HOLD OCCIDENTAL STOCK, THE SHARE PRICE WONT INCREASE MORE THAN 10% IN THE NEXT 3 YEARS. OCCIDENTAL SHARE PRICE HAS NOT INCREASED ABOVE 31 US DOLLAR IN THE LAST 2 YEARS."
If you dont have to stomach to endure the bumpy ride due to covid oil stocks are the wrong place to be right now....risk reward...the fund managers are back on auto pilot...buy all tech and stay at home...pes 100-1000....oil stocks are still way out of favor FOR NOW....however if you think covid will fears will fade this sector has tremendous upside ..if you think Rome is burnings invest in a tech stock or stay at home with massive pes and huge risk when covid subsides ...it was bumpy back from the bottom and expect no different now until covid mania has subsided
"It is very difficult to understand this administration's policies regarding oil and energy in general. First, they block our own oil companies from drilling on federal land. Ok, understood, sort of - you are trying to reduce oil production in order to reduce its usage, which helps environment and pushes towards renewable energy and EVs by making oil & gas relatively more expensive. Obvious consequence is reduced US oil production and inevitable higher oil/gas prices. Administration doesn't like higher gas prices either. They want to lower gas prices, and how? by asking OPEC to increase production. Now they want lower gas prices by increasing production? Why would OPEC listen to you, what leverage do you have on them to make them (including Russia) shoot their on collective feet to make US president happy? What was wrong with letting US oil production work its way through the market dynamics? Is oil produced in OPEC countries burn cleaner than oil produced on US soil? With such flip-flopping, I suspect we will neither achieve lower gas prices nor any environmental improvements...and nearly certainly screw up our energy independence that took decades to build."
"Oil 73 USD and oxy 28 USD ....This is rididcolus, oxy normally would be at 55 USD.With these oilprieces the Anadarko Deal was a GOOD DEAL.Once next asset deal with resonable price will be announced the stock price will skyrocket to 40 USD within one step."

"Oil up $1.30, come on OXY one day hold a $1 plus gain."
"No seriously - I hope to god I’m not stuck on a plane on the tarmac somewhere at 11pm due to weather, missing part, sick crew, blown fuse, or labor dispute and have one of these shorties next to me."

"The API reported a large build in gasoline inventories of 6.414 million barrels for the week ending September 3—compared to the previous week's much smaller 2.711-barrel build. Lousy report for gasoline. Distillate stocks saw a decrease in inventories this week of 3.748 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 1.961-million-barrel decrease. Good report for distillates. Only a 2.882M barrel draw in oil. Lousy report for oil."
***** LOL...... ONLY NOON....... and I'm up 30 already........it's going to be a good winter season in the oil patch !!!*****deepsub
"So much for supply oil deficits, large drawdowns, nothing matters oil sells off and oil stock follow! Fact is $70+ oil and oil stocks are still in the toilet! This story is getting really old."
WTI is on fire this morning.
OPEC may halt output growth! The market is paying almost zero attention we can wake-up tomorrow and OPEC decides not to increase production due to some recent softness in demand due to Delta. Notwithstanding we still have a supply deficit (I expect a big DOE oil inventory draw tomorrow).Check out by Googling: OPEC+Oilprice+News
"The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday reported a large draw in crude oil inventories of 4.045 million barrels for the week ending August 27, bringing the total 2021 crude draw so far to more than 62 million barrels, using API data.Analysts had expected a loss of 2.833 million barrels for the week."
"I've got to give it to the Bears. They warned us in early July, and I got that sinking feeling in late July but thought it was just noise. If you think this can't go lower, look at last year, it bleed until Nov, and only stopped because of the vaccines. That's not going to save us now. I've said it numerous times, there is no floor. I thought I'd start buying in at $22, nope. Maybe $17. We will likely see it this Fall. God help us all. "
"Could not pass up this opportunity to add more warrants. I thought $10 was not a bad entry, just a few days ago, but $8.60 today was even sweeter. I still believe in positive fundamentals in oil and value in oil stocks. Willing to ride this cycle of volatility for another month or two."
Wiseman-Chevron Corp Chief Executive Mike Wirth said on Wednesday(9/15/2021) the company prefers to return money to its shareholders rather than use it to invest in solar and wind power projects.
"I think once we know how OPEC is going to respond to the delta variant - good or bad, we’ll see a spike. The market likes to know what’s going on and OXY is doing great, no matter what happens."
Look on the bright side:AAPL is down -3.4%TSLA is down -2.6%BTC is down -2%Oxy is doing pretty good comparing to these giant companies. Does that make you feel better W?

"I remind all…Oxy is a 50 usd stock minimum, thats my opinion and watch the chart. Oil was lower and oxy at 60 usd. Crazy world and manipulated.I adding additional shares.Oxy is a cashmachine at these levels, debts no issue anymore.Oxy Chem is a cash machine too.Screaming buy."
What I am still hoping for is a shoutout from papa Elon on our carbon management projects.
"Oil will MASSIVLY rise very soon, latest once opec will slow its output with a new agreement.Oxy is a 50 usd Stock and has additional to oil business a very strong chemical business with giant earning growth.I am adding, for me a big opportunity. A Little Bit patience is necessary , but I guess, I will be rewarded with +100%.Maybe Exxon makes an offer. It would be much cheaper than their own exploration cost. Exxon spends 20 billion each year in exploration, u ING oxy with 40 usd offer would be 30 billion + 35 billion debts would be MUCH CHEAPER AND MUCH LESS RISK.Exxon would get a great chemical and hydrogen business on top.Think about that."

I imagine that today the western Gulf of Mexico is now seeing its share of well and platform shut-ins. This should come on top of those wells offline in the eastern gulf.

WTI is on fire though; it might break $70 today. What's OXY's break even oil price W?

Oil is up due to a hurricane headed right at the region....daytraders who are on the right side of the trade should be happy ..but all the ones on here have puts....the only benefit to oil from storm is that it will probably take out 3 days of supply ...similar to what is happening in Mexico. it does tighten suply for a period of time..the best news is that nat gas is getting very tight overseas and that is a big part of OXY
"Is the business sound? Has Oxy cut costs? Are they the low cost producer? Are they generating FCF? And it’s not 2020, oil isn’t going to ZERO. Open the tequila and comeback on Monday."

"January 25th 2020 - OXY trading around $45 pps. Price of WTI Oil trading around $53. And that’s when OPEC was at war internally. OXY did have a higher dividend at that point, but they also had more debt. Debt has been reduced and the dividend will be restored at some point. Oil was the only sector that never fully recovered from the pandemic. This is way undervalued in my opinion. "
U WON'T WORK TO COMPRESS IT ANY FURTHER!AGAINST TREND AND INDICES - DO NOT PASS!
Why was there a shock to the market this morning? Hopefully it starts to recover and OXY will rebound 2.5x the market.

I would like to see and it is possible for the company by sometime in the second quarter of 2022...... to initiate a divvy...... to start with just 1 buck per share, and provide guidance that would include raising the dividend by $0.25 each quarter thereafter until it's back up to $2 per share........ as market conditions allow...... in other words .....

"In human history, human always thrive to have more efficient energy sources, wood to coal, coal to oil, etc. Each transition took more than 1/2 century or a century. This is the first time we are heading from efficient to inefficient energy transition route -- so called as green energies. Yet, the fact is our infrastructure is far apart to support the green energy ideas. It will cost unthinkable money and effort to reach the desired level, and it is no guarantee that whether it would be sustainable. Personally, the green energy ideas are all non-sense. They will eventually realize the ideas are economically impossible and too expensive. You need to realize more importantly that these green ideas allow regulators and billionaires to create multiple tax credits, ""green"" taxes and ""free"" grants, which allow them to suck tax funds or ""steal"" profits from one sector to theirs. Some of these tax credits, which is normally non-refundable are refundable, allowing them to receive ""credits"" while reporting losses in their tax returns. Again, when you look at the big picture, they are using ""green"" as their promotional tool to suck tax funds. The oil sector is one of the sectors that is being attacked in this agenda, as the transition is from the oil. We are also being attacked by the ""green"" taxes. But soon they will realize who the king is in the commodities and even in energy."

"Big things coming. Interest rate hike means the bond yield goes up; growth stocks go down. Oil stocks typically follow the bond yield. Growth stocks would likely stay flat or decline as the rates go up over the next couple of years. Also, opec playing nice. The delta variant has given them the green light to runneth up the price of oil. OXY has plenty of assets that can now be sold at fair market value. They could literally sell 5-8 billion in one swoop, plus pay down 3 billion/quarter due to the high oil prices. We could see a surprise at any moment: large asset sales + 2-3 billion that can be paid down with cash generated from operations. We could see them retire 8-11 billion and bring back an awesome dividend."
Report out that China is hoarding oil at these prices ..it appears that they expect much higher oil prices ..LNG buyers are asking for therir overage limits also because of shortage fears

"We have US selling oil from reserves, China releasing oil from their national reserves, inventory of DUC at a multi-year low, combined with strict CapEx discipline from Big oils. We even had POTUS begging OPEC to increase supply. What more proof of coming supply crunch do we need?"
"Yes, oil will eventually stabilze....Big investors are buying apa, cvx, rds......Nobody is buying up Oxy.....why?? its immense debt eats everything up......thanks to Vicki Hollub, only warren buffett is dancing around with his 800 million of shareholders once great dividends going to him, ONLY.......You should hear the comments about Oxy on the street......sadly, all the boosters on this site seem to think they are way ahead, having purchased Oxy at 10 or 12......They haven't been around since Oxy was close to 80, less than 2 years ago , with a great dividend.....Until Vicki leaves, the stock won't do much, certainly nowhere as well as the other majors in oil.....why would hedge funds purchase this company when down the road, its immense debt eats everything up.....it will take years to even come close to getting rid of the debt but by then, all the others will have made fortunes......"
"Two stock upgrades for August, one a Buy and another a Strong Buy"
"W, I am still confident Oxy will rebound back to green today. What do you think?"
"Ignoring pundits’ oil price increase forecasts and assuming Q2 revenue for rest of the year, OXY would deliver $23.51Bn in 2021 revenue vs. current market cap of $23.99Bn. This stock will keep going higher as the debt continues to fall."
Natural Gas at a the highest in over 5 years! OXY is making lots of money? You think?
When does OPEC+ finish their meeting today??????
Need to get thru the usual 9:45 am sell off or short ladder.
"Look at the YTD, see the 3 spikes? We are in pullback mode from those, but within the next 12 months, we’ll see the same pattern, except these next 3 will all be higher than the last one. Hold it and buckle up, next leg is coming   "
"OPEC raised its forecast for global oil demand for 2022 by just under a million barrels a day to 100.8 million barrels a day, higher than 2019’s demand level of 100.3 million...Wall Street journal quote."
"Today is one of the biggest head fakes in oil to date. EIA and API blowout numbers, Hurricane shutdown production and OPEC stays the course. If delta variant was the issue we would see a much smaller drawn down on inventories. Nothing could be further from the truth."
"W, always sell in the morning and buy back at end of day. You can double your money in no time."
"Now own OXY and it joins CVX, COP and RDS-B as my energy holdings. Hoping for the reopening trade to come back to life soon."
"Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson's 2Q investment moves showed a bullish take on energy companies, with new stakes in BP and Shell and Apache parent company APA and raised stakes in Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum."
Where's W? He's whining that much this morning surprisingly. Here's your chance to buy cheaper. Oil companies are making ton of money with oil at $70. Remember it was only $60 in 2019.
EIA report: Wow! Total commercial inventory dropped 13.6MB! That too with increased imports. Oil -7.2M (6% below 5-year average)Gasoline: +1.3M (2% below 5-yr average)Distillates: -1.7M (9% below 5-yr average)Propane: +0.5M (20% below 5-yr average)Seems like oil traders are waiting on OPEC+ decision.
"W....the stock's up 6%+. Would 36% make you happy?I love your enthusiasm! But, you're the kind of guy that chases people away from a profitable craps table. Don't be surprised if oil companies take a hit from being down 2-3 weeks on some of their ops and lost demand. The overall environment for the coming year is bullish.Make a small donation to a hurricane recovery cause and go play some golf."
Someone is buying all these delicious shares at huge discounts.
"FYI - also saw today one of my Propane Supplier stocks (not producer) reporting can’t deliver some product due to lack of drivers. I would do it but I have 3 DWI, 2 Wrckless, 1 Drivewith Revoked. The TX DMV calls it a Driver Hat-Trick"
***** Hurricane watch is in effect for the middle of the Texas coastline and Louisiana as tropical storm Nicholas looks to make landfall late Monday night....... affecting the coastline between the mouth of the Rio grande and high island off of Louisiana....... this occurring just as the nine refineries in Louisiana are just now getting operations up to speed but being held back by lack of feedstock from producers in the GOM........ should be a pretty good draw down in crude and gasoline this week I would think.......*****deepsub
"Weird that this falls 2-3x more than the other oil stocks the past couple days. And also weird that oil goes up, oil stocks fall, when oil goes down, it falls even further. Someone please buy OXY out for $35 a share right now."
"I totally agree... OXY is at least a doubler.The valuation is a big joke.. a bargain.I do not understand, why oxy is not at 60 USD.Oil is hihger than befpre corona and oxy was at 66 USD????Now ridicolus 28 USD ....I guess we need an substantial asset sale, what will happen soon.Viki queen of modern OIL….remember this, in Q4 2022, this company will generate 12 bill FCF, and have 20 bill of dept…..Generation opportunity"

"The market wants to take it down but OXY will not go down without a fight. There's definitely a lot of support at $25. Not every September is bad for oil stocks. This year might be different. If not, we can add more on every 5% drop. Good luck W and all Oxy investors."
"Miller Tabak's chief strategist, Matt Mailey, spotted a rare technical analysis pattern - the golden cross - on the weekly WTI crude oil price chart. The analyst told about this in an interview with CNBC. • Golden Cross occurs when the short-term moving average of an asset crosses and exceeds the long-term moving average. Usually this situation is viewed as a signal for further growth. • The $ GS analyst also believes that oil prices will rise due to increased consumption amid rising prices for gas (for gas, talks about a price of $ 10 in the future are already beginning) and other alternative energy sources."
"WTI at $68 is a sweet spot. dont forget we got $60 ish oil for second quarter with the stock averaging $27. nothing changed, only lower costs, marginally better peoduction and marginally better oil prices. third quarter would still better the second"
"You guys have no idea what’s coming. Oil prices may approach all time highs within the next 1-2 years. The more EVs on the road, the more remote work; the higher the price of oil will go "
"With Brent and light sweet at almost 60 day highs, I don’t see why OXY shouldn’t be $33 by Friday. May god bless the Soviet Union"
I’m holding despite losing about a million. That’s small stuff if this goes to TP or $40. Not sweating it right now
$40 by 1Sept 22..For the Warrents. $60 for the Stock.
"Gonna get walked down as funds come in today during quad witch, not a big deal going to be alot of movers today on weird volume."
I sincerely believe we will finish the end of year in the $30s. Maybe more if they announce some huge asset sales/debt reduction.
Almost $72 a barrel this morning. Hoping this knocks out the 10 am selloff hour
***** BTW..... did any of you OXY-fans see the news a few days ago about WES?They announced a buyback of senior notes to the tune of 1/2 billion $$$$........ MORE debt reduction! With NG selling now at these high levels...... their profits going ahead are going to be greatly enhanced......*****deepsub
"If you want to see our potential in market cap and where our stock price could be heading you should go compare OXY to COP, our numbers are very close and if we drop our debt we should have a larger market cap then them."
USA new covid cases might be falling fast:Aug 27 192kAug 28 88kAug 29 42kDelta has officially peaked
"Given the storm damage in the gulf , the drop in production & transport , and the continuing weather threat ( it’s still early in Hurricane season ) along with higher consumption across the country , OXY looks primed to hit $30-$32 once again in short order . All IMO."
***** Climbing in PPS in Pre-Mkt already....... WTI inching toward $71/bbl.............LQQKs like good news for the oil patch again today!*****deepsub
Oh yeah DOW is down 230 Pts and OXY down 15 cents - burning? Go back to shorty school in your flood pants.
Max pain for today's calls is $25. The option thieves are hard at work today trying to close it at $25.
Got my popcorn! Time to watch the daily plummet!!!
"Help me understand: i looked at 5 yrs of oil price (WTI) and compared it with APA, GUSH, OXY. All three stocks trended Downward and showed NO correlation or just nominal correlation to price of oil. Can anyone explain? Is this on depletion concerns?"
@AAA Looks like green to me today. Your short is going against you. To bad no red.
AND GO 28$
"OXY should focus on paying Buffet back first, once Buffet is paid he has a year to exercise he warrants at i think $62, his debt is the highest interest too if i’m not mistaken."

What happens to your EV when it and your garage are in 2' of water?
Light sweet + Brent went up but OXY didn’t follow.
"Big gap at 21.98, wouldn’t take much to close it."
"$FANG $OXY $APA Strongly positive for following reasons:1-All three oversold2-Delta cases peaking in US, following UK model. With decreased gov interventions, this should INCREASE mobility, ppl's comfort for travel, help with gas prices3-Typically, this is a low season for oil but like most things this year, I predict it will be different because of COVID meaning that oil will go up between now and Oct. 4-Mideast tensions high and will remain high with Afghanistan mess, supporting higher oil prices5-US 10 yr yield predicted to rise to 1.75-2%...this alone will lead to these stocks taking leg higher to recent highs and further"
BP and RDS are carrying the entire oil sector with their share buyback program.
"Hurricane Isa: record oil production losses continueHurricane Ida has led to the largest-ever initial loss of crude oil production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from a hurricane in the ten days since the first platforms were evacuated, according to estimates by Bloomberg.Sixteen years to the date after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, Hurricane Ida crashed into the state on August 29 with Category 4 winds, 15-foot storm surge, and flooding.During the ten days since the first platforms were evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ida in the middle of last week, 16.8 million barrels of oil production have been lost, Bloomberg’s calculations show. To compare, this production loss is 32 percent higher than the output lost in the first ten days after Katrina in 2005, and 42 percent more than the ten-day loss of oil production after Gustav/Ike in 2008.Disruptions from Katrina lasted for months, and some of the production never returned.A week after Ida made landfall on August 29, and ten days after the first platforms were evacuated, as much as 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd), or88.32 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico production, continued to be shut-in as of September 5, data from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) shows. A total of 82.72 percent of the daily natural gas production in the Gulf was also shut-in as of Sunday evening.The shut-in oil production was lower than on Thursday, when 1.7 million bpd, or 93.55 percent, of all daily crude output was offline.Utilities across Louisiana are working to restore power to residential and commercial areas. According to Entergy, Hurricane Ida’s Category 4 winds, 15-foot storm surge, and flooding made it one of the most devastating storms to hit the Entergy region. The estimated 950,000 customers affected are second only to Hurricane Katrina’s 1.1 million who were left without power. Restoration times are up to three weeks in the hardest-hit parishes in Louisiana, Entergy said on Friday."
"OPEC is suggesting that the planned increase of 400,000 barrels a day might be cut considering delta variant. OIL BOOM COMING!"
"Cramer now bullish on OXY, price of oil surging and shorts going crazy. The perfect storm. Higher."
***** OXY today was upgraded to an 84 relative strength rating up from 78 just a couple of days ago.......... FWIW*****deepsub
Love the trend lines. Longs stay patient.
Every one of these liberal mummy advisers needs to go!!!
chk history..last time oil was at this level..oxy s.p was in the 50s
"Is this good or bad for OXY stock? HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp on Wednesday said in a securities filing seven of its 10 offshore oil production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remain offline since Hurricane Ida.Hurricane Ida tore through the Gulf of Mexico late last month knocking out some 80% of the region's offshore oil and gas production. Restarts have been slowed due to damages to offshore oil and gas transfer facilities and onshore resupply operations."
Much to my surprise we are actually holding up pretty well for a red day in oil and majority of indexes.
"When the price of oil and SPY falls, and OXY is consolidating, this is the best sign!"
"Put this into perspective, we have $75+ Brent $72+ WTI $ 5.00+ natural gas and look at the stock price of OXY. What is wrong here???? Anyone have an intelligent answer that makes sense?????"
"Oil is climbing, demand is climbing, economy is firing on four cylinders, we the energy investors going to be making a lot of cash over the coming weeks. The US is in very bad shape when it comes to their inventory levels. So bad that they don’t have enough oil to sell to China let alone keep up with their own demand now and that’s why you saw the Chinese release some oil from their reserve along with US. All oil stocks are going to do very well. My number one pick still remains Baytex Energy ticker $BTE $BTEGF.$OXY $XOM $SU $CNQ $MEG $CVX $USO $TSLA $LCID $BNS"
Volume is good and steady right now
when is OXY going to announce another tender offer? how big will it be?
"Don’t let the headlines fool you. The economy is recovering much faster than anticipated. August vaccination rates were higher than July. COVID cases are dropping or flatlining in many states. The media wants the federal cash machine to keep pumping, but it will end eventually and the US consumer will be left holding the bag. Oil is the only place to be right now and a hedge against any news - good or bad. WTI should continue its run regardless of the daily vomit the media spews. "
"What a switch, market in the red and oil stocks green! That is a nice change, in fact it is almost a unique event!!!!!! Nice surge in buying!!!!"
"Money is going into crypto instead of commodities like before. Usually with a low dollar, commodities prices shoot through the roof, but with so much USD in crypto, inflation of commodities hasn’t happened. We need the crypto market to crash for real world assets to be valued at its true value. Oil and all other commodities are still cheap once crypto is out of the picture."
"W, buy now. It's going back up."
"***** HENRY HUB NG price------ $5.46/mcf.

To the moon BOYSSSSSSSSS
Oxy is a $3.5 billion per quarter cash cow is a no brainer investment. lol
OXY is making so much money every money manager is dumping the stock!!!!
I look forward to the last week of September when OXY announces debt tender offers. 3 or 4 billion? We shall see.
***** hearing rumors from another board....... about the EIA #...... a drawdown of OVER seven million barrels of gasoline......... I get the feeling the way things have traded this morning....... this info was already out amongst some of the privileged in the information chain......*****deepsub
"Hurricane Ida caused many refineries have to shutdown, and hurricane season has just started. OXY and CVX will rise quickly!"
SP taises it's rating of OXY to BB. I think that they see OXY lowering its debt load substantially in the near future.
The oil inventory keeps shrinking on a weekly basis. I hope that inventory shrinks to the historical low level and gas price goes over the roof so that people run out of gas and electricity and learn the lesson hard way that the oil is the king of the commodities and energy.
Does anyone know if the warrants are callable by Oxy ? I suspect they may have such a provision to allow Oxy to effectively repurchase an obligation for future shares at a discount at some point.???
***** From WSJ : Current analyst ratings for OXY-------------11 BUY.....0 OVERWEIGHT.....15 HOLD.....0 UNDERWEIGHT.....3 SELL. >>>>>>>. >>>>>>> Recent consensus overall rating moved UP..... from HOLD to OVERWEIGHT*****deepsub
They had some interesting insights about OXY on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Anyone look at the price of natural gas lately..wow
Nice comeback!
"If jobs report looks good, I would expect a real rotation to commence. Nowhere I’d rather be than right here. The economy will get better, the fed will taper, the fed will raise rates, oil will stay high, and oil companies will be cash pumping machines.Dividends and buybacks galore over the next several years. This is it folks, if you’re not in now, you’ll miss it. We should absolutely see the fed change it’s tune between now and the end of the year. "
$ 27.47 is the best point to open LONG!
Congrats to all who held through the most recent downturn. Nice to see OXY outperform in September! I will sell now. I’m up about 80% after averaging down on my YTD cost. I hope to be back in before the dividend returns.
"Shortage of fosil fuel supply is coming, it is coming fast….."
Is everyone happy with the performance of OXY the past two days??????
Looks like its energy rally time
An increase of 2.71 million barrels of gasoline is not good!
Oxy is fair valued at 50 usd. It is a no brained at theses ridicolous low level.
"You’re suppose to ignore this weeks trading folks, Friday is QuadWitching day and this week was already decided a few weeks ago."
"Pretty Green and Natural if You Ask Me!Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals.

Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels.$BTE $OXY $SU $MEG.CA $XOM $CNQ $USO $SNP $PTR $BP $CVX $TOT"
"This just form the news wire: OXY said six Gulf of Mexico platforms have either restarted or are prepared to resume production, while the remaining four platforms remain offline as the company works with its partners."
"Its one thing to have such strong oil prices in Q3, but what about nat gas?? 30% of Oxys production is nat gas and 18% is nat gas liquids....great, right??Well the avg price of nat gas in q2 was $2.64, what will Q3 be?? Sure seems like it will fall in the mid $4. range which will produce serious cash flow!!"
"Between now and mid next year, once the covid starts fading away, OXY and the oil companies will be traded in the next higher price range (i.e. $35-45 for OXY). By then, you will realize that the current up/down is just volatility in a lower price range."
"third time there going to short from 27 to 24, its seriously so petty and boring at this point"
"OXY sells 630,000 Mcf per day at a hedged price of $3.61 which is less than 50% of their total production in natural gas the other 50%+ is sold at the market, now $5.271."
All you can do is hold on for now and wait for the cycle to be complete. In a couple of weeks we will see a rebound and smoother sailing.
Summer is almost done. Tuition payments have been made. Kids heading back to school. Time for supply to tighten and oil shoots to 100/. And Oxy gets the debt into the “20’s of billions” by EOY. Going to be a great second half of the year. Patience.
OXY having a great day congrats longs !!
"Oil will go up after it comes out that we were lied to about demand destruction due to 2 mbpd less refinery demand. With gasoline storage, real demand is consumer demand, unchanged. Real output destruction of 2 mbpd in the gulf is real, and not reported as such. These lies will be exposed in the coming weeks inventory levels. The deeper issue is, why is our deep state is spending so much effort trying to to suppress American oil. Surely some of that brainpower and effort could have been applied to the Afghan withdrawal, which was botched beyond belief. Impeach 46!"
"Utility ETF paying 6% dividend, near guarantee to make a rising profit or crude stocks paying the same or less and everyone trying to put them out of buisness."
OPEC+ said there is no need to release more into the market despite the Mummies request for OPEC to increase output. They basically said mind your own business Mummy.
Same pattern every morning this week. Hedge funds playing their usual games
Happy to see W calm and relaxed
"What a difference a day makes, yesterday at oil low;“Hopefully oil is just down because the Saudi’s and Russians are selling it hard to scare OPEC into keeping production down. We’ll see soon”"
"Finally, this is what we've all been waiting so painfully long for, the upward trend in oil stocks!!!! I hope we see $80 oil by the end of the month!!!"
"lol dude..even China has now started to release oil from their strategic reserves. Oil demand is recovering and will probably exceed pre-pandemic levels, while at the same time supply is being constrained. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-china-auction-7-38-124009618.html"
"***** something is not adding up------the last two days the stock has been showing up on the ticker tape way more than normal, indicating increased trading....... but at this time the volume for the day is only about half of normal volume, this late in the day......... could it just mean a lot of retail activity and smaller trades? Dunno, but with recent upgrades it seems like some news is imminent........ just a feeling more than anything else....*****deepsub"
Great news. Looks like OPEC is committed to WTI oil in the $60s+. Extremely bullish for OXY. Today is a great buying opportunity.
Added OXY to my long term investment. This will be 50 by next year.
WTI down 15 cents and OXY down 15 cents PM. So do wr sell off today? What no two days in a row green?
Go walk your dog W then check stock prices.
JP Morgan just went to underweight; a distaste for cash flow going against debt vs. shareholders.
"Rigged game that we are trying to participate in. Oil up today and oil stocks are getting crushed. Oil stocks are extremely undervalued vs. historic valuations but the big money and the talking heads would prefer to own overvalued speculative tech companies that will never earn enough profit to justify their valuations in our lifetime. Then on the other end of their mouth, these same people try to get on their high horse and tell retail investors that ""valuations"" matter. What a joke."
I think the 3 indexes will be red end of day and OXY will close 4-5% green. What do you think W?
No worries. Just the fed talks about tapering. Oxy will make a nice reversal and rally tomorrow on EIA data. Don't worry and be happy. Especially for W panicking.
"Oxy reporting no material damage from storm, although their full restart timeline is somewhat dependent on 3rd party contractors.Sept 8 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp:* OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP SAYS CO CONTINUES TO EVALUATE IMPACT OF HURRICANE IDA ON ITS GULF OF MEXICO AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS* OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP SAYS RELIEVED TO REPORT THAT ALL EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS ARE SAFE FOLLOWING THE STORM* OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP SAYS CO'S OFFSHORE PLATFORMS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO DID NOT INCUR ANY STORM-RELATED DAMAGE* OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP - CO'S LOUISIANA-BASED CHEMICAL FACILITIES DID NOT INCUR ANY MATERIAL STORM-RELATED DAMAGE AND ARE IN PROCESS OF RESTARTING* OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM - OPERATIONS IN GULF OF MEXICO ARE RELIANT UPON THIRD PARTIES, CANNOT PROVIDE TIMELINE FOR FULL RESTORATION OF OPERATIONS AT THIS TIME"
"Thumbs up for those who think OPEC will surprise with a cut, citing delta. Thumbs down for those who think no change is coming. Comment for those who think OPEC will increase production."

Hopefully oil is just down because the Saudi’s and Russians are selling it hard to scare OPEC into keeping production down. We’ll see soon enough.
"Buy points at 22.50, 17.50 and 13.5. They’ve thrown the most amazing news at oil stocks and they havn’t move a cent! Sitting’ them out unless I get pullbacks."
The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (BSEE) latest estimates show that approximately 48.56 percent of the current oil production and approximately 54.39 percent of the current gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is still shut in as a result of hurricane Ida.
***** HO HO HO ...... say it isn't so........BAC sez crude oil could rise to $100 per barrel due to cold winter weather....... and GOLDEN SLAX added that we could see $100 oil because of failure to make a deal with the Iranians on the nuclear deal or no deal.......... while other analysts are claiming it commodities in general will be rising under huge demand and low supply...... except for oil of course which they don't think can go any higher....... they hope! (vbg)*****deepsub
looks like a market rotation from faang and nasdaq to the 'stable' dividend payers...
"If you think OXY is ever going to rally, I recommend you look at BP and Chevron. Both are buying back huge amounts of shares and have excellent earnings and a huge dividend and they are flat dead!"
I think the OPEC agreement will fall apart.... And you'll see 50 dollar oil again.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Post after post why arent oil stocks higher...COVID HEADLINES....its directly related...as soon as negative headlines hit fear of demand concerns rise....ANTIVIRAL pills are in lte stage trials at merck and pfizer...they work on all variants and work like tamiflu..merck will have 10 million doses ready in months in advance of approvals....when covid fears subside there will be the next leg up for many oil stocks and zoom pelaton and all the massive pe stocks will........india is cranking out about 200 million doses a month of vaccines right now so they can blanket the world quickly ....
OXY has declared force majeure in it's chemical operations... They sent a letter out to their customer base last week and apparently can't meet contractual supply commitments for chlorine and other chemicals. What this is going to mean financially may take some time before we commoners know.
"MRO, XOM, XOP going up! OXY lagging as usual!!!!!!Reply"
US oil inventories could litary go to zero... and oil traders would be like ... eh wait lets be careful here.. I heard there might be a small fishing boat coming from Oman in couple of weeks with some barrels...very bearish
Look at this manipulation! Oil continuing to go up and oxy headed the other way now down 52 cents from high! Just criminal IMHO!
I would like to know how much disruption in oil production OXY suffered due to IDA?? Are their oil rigs in the GOM up and running??? Does anyone have any information???
"As I pointed out last week; “ Another manipulation? Notice how OXY made a slight new low in the end of October last year before moving up 230% in 4 months and now a week ago in made a slight new low (relative April lows) and is now on fire? Seems the programs hit the stops and wash out all enthusiasm so the big money can buy while retail is selling.”The job of professional traders with hundreds of billions of dollars at their disposal is to take your money. This isn’t just OXY, the XOP ETF also hit those stops and a lot of other oil company stock. It’s a hurricane of money and they will find ways to shake you off that tree and make a meal out of you."
This month can be volatile as institutions are manipulating the market. Weak hands like W will have a heart attack someday lol
***** All this B.S. will come to a screeching halt once the dividend is reinstated........ by then we'll have a higher credit rating as well and money will flock into this stock like crazy......... and I will hold my shares like I would hold my wallet in a side street in Hong Kong...... kowloon- side........*****deepsub
i will hold once stock price is fair valued at 50 USD.
Somebody tell W we are up 5 cents
"Nice comeback, closed only 20 cents below the high of the day!......LOL........"
WTI back close to the high of the day $69.83. Oil stock should be much higher in price!
all the market players are selling OCCIDENTAL STOCK. OCCIDENTAL share has BARRIER PRICEAT 31.5 USD DOLLAR. ı sell occidental when share price is above 27 us dollar and buy back when share is at 22 us dollar. easy trade. sell tomorrow

W very calm today. I like that. I suggest you take a 2 month break and come back to collect. OXY at $40
Does anyone remember hurricanes Katrina or Rita? One caused significant gathering and pipeline damage offshore. Does anyone remember how long it took for damage assessments to come in and spur prices upward? Thx.
We have a few very bullish signs for OXY
This should be trading around $40. Way undervalued here.
Anybody know how to Unmute someone? I kind of mis W.

This management needs to announce a bond purchase to send a signal that they are serious about reducing the debt. They need to send a positive signal to the market to stop this incessant dumping!
"This stock's performance today is utterly disgusting out of all the oil stocks in the sector it is one of the worst performers!!!!! That is a fact look at all the stocks in the XOP! That is managements fault now matter how you slice or dice it, management is responsible for the stocks performance since they are the ones that have the power to change it!!!!!"
"You guys have to remember: OXY would like to sell some assets that could be in the 5-8 billion dollar range. If that happens and they have free cash flow from operations, look for a 30% debt reduction overnight."
We are almost $10 dollars down from July. It's astonishing.
Sell programs by hedge funds!!!! Hope no one fell for their BS manipulation????
Will we hit $30 this week?
At least close on the green for W lol. I still see an easy 20% gain from here. This stock will beat the market easily in next next 3 months before end of 2021.
"***** If EIA #s back up the API later this morning, and concur that there was a huge drawdown in gasoline of over 6 million barrels, the price of crude could break through the $70/bbl Mark today------which would be a great positive psychological barrier broken that would lift the energy sector and oil patch stocks....... let's see what happens!*****deepsub"
