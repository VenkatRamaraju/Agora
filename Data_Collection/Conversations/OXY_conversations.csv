"It think it can be well assumed that the sell off in the energy sector was a overdone today; and perhaps a correction will be healthy before we take the next leg up. Judging by the after hours action and the increasing after hours bid, I believe we are heading up from here. Never is a straight line and volatility should be expected as oil has gone up quite a bit in the past couple weeks. Truth is nothing has really changed. The trend is up and today was just a heavy counter trend move. For me $38-$42 in the next month or so is the expectation."
Buying OXY is like buying a lotto ticket you know is the winning ticket
OPEC set the stage for rally in oil next week by reducing the deficit from 1.1M boe/day to 300k boe/day. justifying their plan to gradually increase as oil demand increases. Their heels are dug in Joe. No more oil for you!!
"I just purchased more OXY, I really think this move down is a great buying opportunity, I do believe we are heading to $40 in December."
"The after hours jump could be from Suncor Energy Inc. SU symbol. Reported after hours. Had phenomenal quarter, this Canadian company. But what dampen the stock tomorrow is that last check, Brent crude has significantly went down on the 2nd day. This is an almost a $5 drop in 2.5 days. Very significant. So, we have big profit selling after Brent reaching 15 year high. This will have a negative effect on oil stocks tomorrow. Brent is getting crushed right now. I should have sold 1 future contract — I would’ve made $5,000. Every dollar up or down is $1,000"
"Common sense investingAside from the supply issue that will affect almost every industry except oilapple has euphoric growth during the pandemic due to stimulis and subsididies that allowed a massive part of america to earn more money than pre pandemic and allowed a massive number of people not to py their rent...during the financial crisis there was a new economy forming of sales due to millions of people not paying their mortgages for years and that money got pumped into boats cars and travel...think about amazon and shopify had the perfect storm..almost the entiire planet was forced to shop online ...why would anyone expect to better that as the world re opens....zoom same issue ..pelaton ???your shut in so you pay monthly fees to pelaton..now.?....home improvement..people did not travel so they spent on their homes...home builders....everybody remortgaged and bought second homes in mild climates to escape....fuel cost are way up so the poor airlines will get hit again...the real estate market exploded and many markets went up 50-100% in a year ??? it will have to affect banks soon...PES ON ALL BIG TECH AND FAVORITES WENT UP 10-15 PE during the pandemic 'JUST BECAUSE"" alternatives got pumped through the roof because of agendas..some are way ahead of the next 5 years...speculative stocks went ballistic from millions and millions of new investors to the market with their small accts that basically thought things only go up and that new money moved them...in summary their is one industry that is backed up by strong fundamentals,,,very very low pes and massive cash flow and thats many oil and gas names ..if more big caps on the hit parade stagnate their will be hundreds of billions if not trillions to re position that is why OXY HAS TO TOUT A MASSIVE CAMPAIGN TO SIGN UP LISTS OF COMPANIES FOR DIRECT AIR CAPTURE..THEIR TECHNOLOGY IS SUPERIOR AND JOINTLY OWNED BY CHEVRON BILL GATES AND OXY...BACK ROCK ALONE COULD DOUBLE THIS STOCK IF THEY CAN RATIONALIZE A MUCH BIGGER POSITION due to carbon removal ...bp is going to store carbon under the north sea so they can play too ...everyday you watch cnbc and everone of them says but amazon apple microsft shop etc etc etc the currrent favs ...when those are exhausted ?"
All most all the Oil companys are hitting out of the ball park with their earnings!!Oil is up almost $1.00 today and we are down. Really who are you shorts kidding!!!!!!!!!!
"Oxy will report that dept reduction target in low 20-is will be in Q1_2022…..after that, dividend and stock buybacks……lets go…..to level 60-62$ in mid 2022"
"don't know if anyone has been peeking over at XOM (my other oil play), but it is going parabolic as it earnings approach on Thursday... if they do well, i expect the expectation for other oils to follow, and then the same run up prior to earnings for oxy.. so go EXXON!"
"Old article about OXY hedge “ The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia” So the hedge was just for the summer no?"
It's going to be fun to sit back and watch the share bounce toward $40 when OXY knocks it out of the park next week on earnings and timing for dividend reinstatement
Suncor exploding up 9% after doubling their divvy. They actually missed earning expectations although obviously earning and revenues were up from last year.
"Blowout earnings next week, Thanksgiving Travel after that, huge Christmas Travel after that, continued reopening and cold winter setting in throughout, all ahead the next 10 weeks. Huge consumption increases in an already tight supply. The run up and fun will continue. GLTA"
SU average analyst EPS estimate was $.57 and the high was $.65 and the did $.71 
Every major who has reported earnings has reported and pretty big increase in CapX spending for the future....i don’t like it

$55 price target Raymond James .. no announcement on dividend yet! Make oxy great again!
Alan? Jason? Mehmet? Mary ?
What level does oil have to trade at to get this market to wake up??? WTI $95. These oil stocks should be trading 40% to 50% higher with oil in the $80's....
Oh no!! Oil tanked to $82 per barrel. Let's all sell. Low breakeven prices guys. Big revenues and earnings coming in.$CPE $OXY $CDEV
"the long awaited gap up to 40- looks like it will close quick as many predicted. The push past 40 will be tough though. If we can set a solid floor at 40 after earnings, I will be more than pleased... then the push past 40 will be slow and steady into 2022.. i like thy set up a lot!"
"Raymond James Maintains Strong Buy on Occidental Petroleum, Raises Price Target to $55"
Well shaping up to be a decent enough day. Have to hope XOM and CVX have good earnings; and if we can get an earnings release for OXY anything similar to SU I think most of us will be pretty satisfied.
"The oil build was false: ""The hefty stocks build was because of a large jump in net imports of crude oil while refinery processing remained sluggish, Citi Research analysts said in a note"" This drop in oil prices is also caused by talks with Iran. We all know how that is going to end up. So I expect oil to resume it's uptrend shortly after profit taking subsides."
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
Look like all these analysts have inside information of dividend restoration.. all of a sudden they are all predicting this $50/55 price target. We will find out next week 
"Refiners were slow to process is why there was a build. If it takes 2 gallons of oil to make 1 gallon of gasoline and there was a draw of over 3m in gasoline then it seems to still be a total draw. Shell game but final result is low supply. At the WTI delivery hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, crude storage is the most depleted for three years, with prices for longer-dated futures contracts indicating supplies will remain low for months."
"End of month housekeeping. Oil had a really strong month. Profit taking makes sense. Next catalyst is earnings, debt repayment & forward guidance. Small divy increase announcement???"
"***** 96 cents >>>>>>>> to $1.59 !! These #s represent the new consensus estimates for earnings in the next fiscal year, over the last 60 days from 7 analysts. WOW---- THAT is some increase over a short time, this is coming from Zacks, who now has just move the rating for OXY to #1 (STRONG BUY)..... and a momentum rating of B. We knew that margins were gaining rapidly but these consensus numbers blow the doors off, IMHO...... and over the last few months have watched Zacks increase their rating from a HOLD to a recent BUY, and now just a few weeks later they have it at STRONG BUY, with a RS index # in the mid 80s...... it's no wonder that the stock price is starting to gain traction with all the eyes and spotlights on it !!! ENJOY THE RIDE------OXY-FANS !!*****deepsub"
As posted a month ago if tech continues to beat oil and gas will move slower...greed motivate trades for funds and for almost two years they sat back on auto pilot and just invested in the same list of stocks..microsoft beat so now they back to auto pilot feeling sedate that they do not have move ..YET...however % gains will be much tougher goinf forward than the massive % gains tech had the past 16 months ...for micsoft to show another 35% gain the stock would ahve to go up almost a trillion in market cap....and appple would have to go up about the same...tech gains will slow upward momentum a little but many oil and gas particularly the ones still trading below pre covid levels like oxy apa bp can have high % gains
"but, but, but..... Cramer said oil had topped out 3 weeks ago at 72... i don't understand..."

Alan said we would be down 5% today? Maybe he is out of power again as they are struggling in India

"If you're already banking truck loads of cash at $70 oil, what difference does it make whether oil is at $85 or $75?"
SU announced restoring dividend. Doubling. Previously planning a 25% increase. Quarter numbers are great but the future is also looking great. Looks like the quarter numbers will exceed high expectations.
Did you anyone try to time and sell your stock or warrants yesterday or is everyone here (including me) feeling the pain from holding?
"What we have hear today is a 2% decline in oil prices. However, nobody is focusing on the fact that we have a 4.15% increase in natural gas prices. 630,000 Mcf per day of natural gas is hedged at $3.61 which is well under 50% of daily production. Over 50% natural gas production about 650,000 Mcf per day is sold at market which is $6.27."
"OPEC sees smaller oil market deficit in it Forth Quarter, reduction to 300,000 barrels a day from 1.1M barrels a day. OIL dropping on the news."
