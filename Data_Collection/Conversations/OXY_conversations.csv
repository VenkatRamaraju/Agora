"Occidental favours re-establishing dividends over production growth - CEOBY Reuters— 10:08 AM ET 10/07/2021HOUSTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Occidental wants to raise margins and re-establish dividend payments for its shareholders rather than focus on growing its production volumes, Chief Executive Vicki A. Hollub said on Thursday.Oil companies can best contribute to the energy transition by producing just enough oil to meet demand in a way that is more efficient and produces fewer emissions, the CEO said.""We don't see that in 2022 and beyond that we need to grow significantly,"" Hollub said at an online event by the Energy Intelligence Forum.""Our growth in the period, and maybe over the next ten years, will more be to reestablish dividend and grow that dividend"".

Any of you complaining about OXY weren’t trading it last year when it went from $25 to nine dollars while oil was rising. Vickey Mouse messed this company up in a huge huge way.
"As per Dow Jones Newswire, E&P stocks (they specially mentioned OXY and three others) are 60% discount to the overall market based on enterprise value/cash flow, against a five-year average of 45%. McDermott wrote that the stocks now are discounting an average crude price of $56.50, against a 12-month strip price of $76 a barrel. This creates ""room for a further catch up trade versus the commodity, even absent higher prices"
Once Ghana deal is signed to anreasonable price as the deal mentioned one year ago with Total ….oxy share would explode in that moment to 50 usd.
So according to a seeking alpha article the current net debt is $31.4Billion ...
Stock price of OXY at 9:48 makes absolutely no sense at all .

"@Wolfee 30K calls between $29 and $35, today. Open interest for weeks out isn't even close to that; however, I don't know what the trend has been."
"Historically, the oil inventory rise from Oct to Dec, but we are at the low level in the 5 year avg chart:https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.phpAt any moment, the inventory could shrink further down and even break the 5 year avg spread. This and the new sentiment of the fear of supply shortage could increase the oil price even further up. The short spammers ( more like hired employees ) have been shown up whenever we reached the ~$32 peaks. However, this time, the story could differ. They are not seeing the tsunami coming toward them. The upward momentum tsunami is on the way and will come soon. Once it is here, they will experience the hell. The force of the universe has positively changed favouring the energy investor. We are at the different environment compared to the previous two peaks."
The 5 day chart here looks like hell . I don’t understand why . OXY’s peers have held up and gone up while OXY lags . I can find no other reason for it except manipulation.
"@Myaccount said EV's efficiency is 3 to 4 times higher than fossil fuel cars. Could you answer which has higher efficiency?(1)Burn fossil fuel to drive cars directly.(2) Burn fossil fuel to generate electricity-> charge battery with electricity-> run battery to drive cars.From thermodynamic points of view, process (2) will lose more efficiency because of extra steps. Of course, this comparison does not consider other cases that generate electricity without fossil fuels."
"EQT CEO on CNBC just explained how the panic buying or stocking up of LNG in both Europe and Asia will persists through the winter regardless of whether it's a cold winter or not... LNG alone will push this stock up $5 per share... add in oil, $45 to $50 pps by February is not out of the question...."
Will we hit $40 this week?
"Looks to me like Oxy and Oxy warrants are breaking out. The debt, is now leverage, for a winning position with wind at our back, as commodity prices rise. The breakouts look significant. Did someone say chart analysis predicted a good chance of a rise in Oxy shares to $38.50+…….suggesting warrants may head for $21.50+?"
"Q3 will be the largest FCF ever in OXY’s history. Why? Because the last time WTI was at $70 (avg for Q3), OXY was producing 700K boe per day. But thanks to the Anadarko acquisition, OXY is now a 1.2M+ boe per day company. The market will have to take notice soon and push up its valuation, and maybe investment grade rating could happen sooner than expected (Q2/Q3 2022)."
Cash flow last QTR was $2.5Billon ....This QTR should be above $3Billon  4th QTR will be above $3Billion most likely to i think and if we average $70 for 2022 & 2023 then you can expect around $10-$12 Billion free cash flow per those years 
"EVs weight 30% more than fossil fuel cars(FFC) and thus need 30% more energy to travel same distance. If all FCCs are converted to EVs, we will need 30% more energy to generate electricity for EVs. If all the generation comes from fossil fuel, we will need 30% more fossil fuel than now to burn to generate electricity. Even if we replace all fossil fuel with green to generate electricity, we are still generating 30% more heat to warm earth than business as usual."
"Most of us here know we are in a winning trade. Even Wolfe is pretty happy these days (just giving you a hard time my friend) A lot of us have faired pretty well this past week. Me, well I told you, I bought dec 17 options my strike, is $30 and I got them for $300 a piece. At first I was thinking about taking my profits when OXY got to $37 ... right now I don't know. I am pretty sure we will get $40 here. And here's the thing, if I see $37 a share ... I can sell those options for $700 at least ... and turning any trade from $300 to $700 is a good thing. I never try to double my money. Us bulls are in a good spot; the question isn't OXY it's how high oil goes. This is a unique situation if you are in the trade."
"buying 1,000s of shares and warrants"
Bank of America has a 'buy' rating and a $50 price target for OXY stock.
It's about that time that OXY will announce more debt retirement through early redemption.
Oxy has sold more of their assets to reduce the debt on the 38 billion they paid for Anadarko Petroleum.at this rate they will still owe 15 billion after selling ALL their assets--Bright future for this company with abbott and costello as their financial advisors
"Would someone please explain to me how the purchase of the OXY Warrants go, OXYWS. Right now it is around $14. I got a few awhile back. I purchase some OXY shares but wondering if I should dabble with more warrants."
Our Tool In Chief is still pushing OPEC+ for more production. My bet is he raids our national strategic reserves for 10-15 million gallons which will curtail WTI prices temporarily.
"Bought OXY in Sept 2020 at $10.19 on the expectation that a supply crisis will come sooner or later from the underinvestment in production assets. That crunch is nigh. As Goldman is publicly stating:Since that call on oil by Goldman a week ago, energy prices of all kinds have kicked into warp overdrive amid rising supply fears globally."
So somebody just posted today on twitter that Aldous has a $70 price target for OXY at the end of 2023  Guess i’m spot on 
"WTI now over $82, and gas at $5.75…..and both climbing. Be still my heart."

"If you go back and you look at asserts to liabilities you will see we need to drop about $15Billion in liabilities to be able to get to the $60-$75 range, just my analysis from their past balance sheets."
OXY's leverage was bad on the way down and should RIP IT HIGHER on the way up...Mr. Market will correct for this present under valuation. BE THERE. Boolean
Capital one increases price target to $44 (from $40) 
Oil at multi year highs and these oil stocks so disconnected from reality it's pitiful. Valuations need to catch up to reality of higher oil prices.
Oxy share price is now consolidating before heading to $40.Putin: $100 Oil Is “Quite Possible”. I bet OPEC+ is looking for $100/bbl to make up for the -$30/bbl last year.
Wind power fails to meet the expectation in Europe because of Nature mother. Wind turbines acts like windbreaks which block winds. Nature will let wind flow through least resistance path- that is place with least wind turbines.Similar effect apply to solar and EVs. These green will not deliver what they are designed for. It is just a waste of money.
The price action of OXY shares is truly baffling. It seem to trade on sentiment rather than in relation to the price of a barrel of oil or on fundamentals. I say this because not so long ago a barrel of oil was $25 cheaper and OXY traded in the $30's. Now with a barrel of oil in the $80's OXY is still trading in the 30's...I expect Nov 4th will mark a significant turning point for OXY. If it reports a banner quarter I don't think that the market can continue to ignore the company's fundamentals...
***** Have y'all read the latest article out about the Goldman recommendation in the oil patch....(about 4 hours ago) The picked 3 names to top the list for value going forward on the basis of sustainability of free cash flow..... the three names are XOM--HES--OXY. Now I may be a little biased since I am a stock holder in OXY and a bond holder in HES...... but I have to grin to see OXY recommended in such a short list of top quality names in the patch....... their current price Target is $40..... and the rationale is that the underlying assets are underappreciated by the market. FYI*****deepsub
"Add to that, Buffett dumping his shares was also a great warning. The fact that only one insider in the last two years (even at nine bucks!) bought any shares in this #$%$ was also a huge warning sign. OXY?s not out of the woods yet, huge debt and rapidly rising labor costs plus all the materials necessary to keep the place running do not make this a no-brainer. Even when they do return the dividend, what are interest rates going to be that that dividend has to compete against?"
"@Kora ... intelligent minds always think similarly. but you are right, I should change my name to LEGION because we are millions shorting this dead-cat OXY,....maybe you haven't notice the price action the whole week; but I can't tell you more because...."
"One important take away from last few EIA reports is that we are now much more dependent on oil imports. Oil imports have to stay at higher level to maintain our inventory levels and feed refineries. US has nearly relinquished control of world oil as a swing supplier. It is just a matter of time one of our big overseas suppliers toys with us and inventories drop precariously low. This is not good for our national energy security. Ironically, as an investor in oil producers, however, it gives me comfort knowing that greedy OPEC+ is in control and not the production-growth hungry shale producers. In some ways, it feels a little like the guy who profited from housing market collapse who saw the big problem oncoming, couldn't prevent it (even if he wanted to), but made money from it."
My bet is that a Oxy returns to a $70-$80 range sometime within the next 6 years. Warrants should then be worth something in the range of $50-$60 from today’s $15. (+250%-300%)I think Oxy gets there or higher within 2-3 years.
"Y because they Can. No growth, No dividends"
How did that guy arrive at a 10% divvy? Many if this is not a screaming buy I don't know what is. Bought back big.
"***""** I don't have a crystal ball of course, but about 35 years of investing in the oil and gas sector......... and all segments except downstream........IMHO, since this renewed cycle got going about a year ago, we are only in the third inning of this baseball game....... implying of course two more years of high demand and low to flat supply....... and I have been through cycles in the market that has been negative/bearish....... while at the same time energy stocks have had a contrary market of their own and one of the only places to hide and prosper during some downturns...... even though it may dampen stock appreciation somewhat...... the right investments in the oil patch can not only make you profit but act as a buffer against negative overall market movement....... been there.... seen that.... done that*****deepsub"

"At anytime, OXY could announce an asset sale where the value will be significantly higher than the value booked in its balance sheet.

"In mid-September, Oxy was reported to be in talks to sell Ghana assets to Kosmos. Does anyone know if things progressed?

"Apologies as I know several people here are not into technical analysis. That being said, the way I see it: OXY seems to be clearly forming a base that started around March this year. The price of crude is also completing a base starting in July that appears ready to break higher.A strong break higher in crude seems a certainty considering, winter/china/recovery heading into the fall and winter months. If a break higher in crude lifts OXY above 33.50 with decent volume; OXY could very well exit it's old base and form new base at a higher level.That all considered, normally I would look for a 20% break up from 33.50 before OXY consolidates or bases again. For me that indicates a $40 dollar price target by the end of the next oil run. Personally I will buy DEC 17 calls at $30 near $3.00 per.Hopefully any or all of this works out and best to all you other bulls out there; I understand the frustration, I just happen to believe longs are soon to be rewarded. I hope I am right :)"
Last time oil was $82 this was a $90 stock. Never know how long oil will last at these levels though.

Most people don’t understand what’s going on with the OXY options. Stock is up 15% in the last 30 days and 200% over the last year. If you think about it the stock is still relatively cheap and should be up another 25%. Remember options expire tomorrow stock will go up next week

"I too am focused on the benchmark price in Feb 2020, right before the pandemic hit. Most independents are up 30%-50%+ from that share price. Oxy is 25% below their share price then in spite of: having delivered significant with divestitures,, having pushed out near term bond due dates, benefitting from off the chart gas pricing with a significant volume unhedged, having benefited from a pretty well structured oil hedge that gave the company the upside up to $70-$75 Brent pricing, and accelerating some permian development through a JV which stretches the performance of their budgeted capex."

"Vicki is now promising to raise the dividend, maybe as high as . 15%......the poor thing knows her reputation is shot on the street and she is now talking about raising the dividend, maybe by as much as . 03%.....WOW.....I get over 5% from other oil producers and have watched my Devon skyrocket as well......Of course, none of my oil patch babies carries the immense DEBT vicki put onto the Oxy shareholders......of course, Warren gets the first billion every year Vicki offered him in desperation when her job was on the line....Until Vicki Hollub is pushed out of Oxy, this stock is not going up anywhere like the other oil babies are.......I sold off my 9000 shares when Vicki first made her ridiculous move and put that money into Devon.......I did buy back a few thousand shares when Oxy was 11 knowing that the dividend didn't exist but i had hope that a certain hedge fund operator was buying in and would try to force Vicki out......He lost however and Oxy is still mired in the high twenties to low thirties even though the price of oil has doubled....i laugh when i read the sites here wondering why Oxy seems to go nowhere while the price of oil skyrockets......The reason is simply VICKI HOLLUB.......when she finally is pushed out, wall street will come back in......SHE ALONE, is the reason this stock sits in this trading range......32 billion in debt, being paid off in small pieces, will take years to be able to offer a real dividend or even buy back shares.....meanwhile, Berkshire can park a billion more a year into other stocks with Oxy shareholders money.....Just look over the desperate flight Vicki made secretly to Omaha to find her savior......"
"Next stop is 60-62$…..I do not like daily movment in price, but that is my target if OIL stay above 70$ in 2022"
Nat gas is the highest in 10 years and oil is through the roof ...capex is down billions and there is no divdiend.....the stock is 10$ less than right before covid when free cash flow was BILLIONS LESS do your own math the dividend 5% of a market cap of 35 billion is 1.7 billion cap ex was about 1.5 billion more per years and they are earning about 3-4 billion more from oil and gas this high...so about 5-6 billion...baord is full of motivations speakers..instead of just doing their trades they post specific buy and sell advice ...you can see the the one an two option trades go through..do you own research but just like the apache board most posters who post specific prices to buy and sell at are wrong almost all the time ..actually most of the sell posts have been here since 9 and at apache since under 4 ..
"1. Paying dept even more in Q4 & Q1_20222. Investment grade - HUGE3. at the end of 2022 dept will be around 20-22$4. FCF in OIL 70$ & GAS 4.0 is around 12 bill5. Market Cap will be around 50-60 bill, x2 from this levelAll this in 12 months"
"Serious question, what reasonable scenario has to happen for OXY to go over $100/share ? If oil stays over $80 for the next couple of years? Inflation continues to go up where the Bonds go over 3%? Before when the economy was flaky and oil was under 40, this was going bankrupt. But now I can see how OXY could be the best energy stock with the owning all of that Permian property."
"This energy crunch and shortage is going to last for at least another year to two. Those in the energy industry know that you do not just turn on supplies as if one was turning on a tap. The pandemic has pushed many of the majors to reduce their capex and investments and with activity returning to almost pre-pandemic levels by end of this year/Q1 next year, the underinvestment in energy industry is going to put significant upside pressure on oil price. I am pretty confident Brent will hold at the price level of at least 80, in reality I see it oscillating between $ 80 and $ 120 till end of 2022. Institutional money are all waiting to see how OXY will manage its debt over the next few quarters, if OXY continues to take positive step to reduce debt , I see OXY going to 60 by end of 2022. Yes....60"
"API 5.21M Build, Cons: 0.140M Build, also reportedly showed inventory declines of 4.6 million barrels for gasoline and 2.7 million barrels for distillates. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub, meanwhile, edged down by 2.3 million barrels for the week, sources said."
"In Q4 we can have 4 - 5 bill FCF from operations, sick……Company who have that FCF are about 200 bill MC in this market"

No volume here today at all . Underperforming vs it’s peers the last two days . Oil on a tear . OXY will be swimming in FCF . When this does pop it’s going to really move .$35 next week is possible IMO
33 usd …this is a big joke.Oxy is a 55 usd Stock Minimum
Oxy will really pop when they “officially”.announce dividend buy backs before earnings.
"Oxy stock appears on the cusp of breaking out with its 3rd approach toward $33 over the last 12 mos. All the recent share price target upgrades add fuel to the fire. The Fitch re-rating upgrade to BBB on the debt has the company poised for an upgrade to an investment grade rating in the near future (I think). The warrants are about to breakout with the stock price, and you can tell that their historical Time price-premium has been reduced over the last year….but I am confident that future volatility and upward price movement should restore another $1 or so in premium to them when in fact they do breakout.I think the company is poised like a coiled spring."
Who is ready to get rich in the oil and gas sector? 100 oil is coming quickly! 1973 all over again!!! $OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPG
This is vastly under valued. The leverage here is palpable. STAY LONG AND STRONG HERE. No matter where I go traffic is immense...people are burning fuel at a significant elevated level of months prior. Boolean
If it closes above $32 today I'm buying Friday Pizza for everyone on the board. Except Eddie!
"***** 7 min. ago, OXY announced it will report earnings on November 4th with a CC on the following day. It's gonna be sweet !!*****deepsub"

"WTI is going to 100$, it is fall, winter is coming…..my goverment today put cap on price on gas stations…..40% more for gas for industry, winter is coming"
It’s embarrassing owning this stock
