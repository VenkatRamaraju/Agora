"Wow, what is going on? Bears collapsing?"
"There is too much uncertainty in the Zillow Homes segment, which accounts for their most significant revenue source. The rising interest rate environment, supply chain shortages, and inflation risk make it challenging ie like a commodity if over pay for your homes and they can only sell them for losses based on a sudden cooling off in real estate - it becomes a death spiral for them risky and now problems being highly sensitive to the real estate market at the top is a very detrimental situation - there is a reason bank of america lowered Z price target to $85 this afternoon"
Impressive growth stock trading at a huge discount
"Well, we all know this is still in the early stages to get into this small and net stock! The potential is fantastic!"
Appl and AMZN and many real estate companies missing by a wide marginblood bath in the markets and Z is possible tomorrow
"Last week Zillow paused home purchases related to its iBuyer segment (Zillow Offers)for the rest of the year to work through a backlog of properties already in the pipeline.We believe there could be three potential factors at play and driving the decision: 1) highdemand and operational constraints related to labor, as called out by Zillow; 2) execution,as Zillow has a history of somewhat inconsistent performance in iBuying; and: 3) Zillowis starting to see weakness in the markets where it is operating and is thus at leasttemporarily pulling back. Based on weakening mid-to-low-end home turnover and asample of 301 properties owned by Zillow and listed for sale on its site, we believeweakening demand could be a potentially big issue and one that may not be fullyappreciated by the Street. We lower our estimates and PO to $85 (from $100) which isnow based on 11x ’22E IMT (internet, media & technology) EBITDA and 1x Homes andmortgage sales (12.5x and 1.5x previously). We believe lower multiples are justified ongrowing risks in each segment. We reiterate Underperform"

"something fishy going on here. Fact- Z bought my sons property three weeks ago for $537,200 and they just listed it for $527,200. I think they are dumping properties. It smells like they know what is coming."
"Congrats everyone, we may be able to mark today down as the last time we saw this under $100! (And part of me hopes I’m wrong so I can pick up some more for cheap!)"

the market is zillows to lose. The ceo seems like a guy that gets the internet and the digital world and that usually spells huge stock returns. I think Zillow will be the future of house buying and people visit the site just to daydream
"Over 14 million shares traded today. Of that, about 1.5 million in the last ten minutes. Someone put about a $150 million bet on Z to close the day.Somebody knows something..."
"Wow, +5.10% on the day for $Z. Embarrassing day for the bears I must say"
"here is the deal hedge fund manager does the pump shows and conferences to make sure he doesnt lose any more money on Z then he has IMHO Gil Simon, the euphoria last a day because every major firm like Bank of America is starting to down grade Z with now a $85 price target from $100 just announced this afternoon unbeknownst to shareholders cause I and other shareholders on other stock message including myself didnt believe such a downgrade to $85 existed, then I find out its actually true but wasnt loaded for people to see till late this afternoon right before closequestion is how many dollars will this drop tomorrow $2, $3 or $4"
Happy Friday. Our baby is trending up today.
It could be a huge margin call on some institutional ZG bear. Quite amazing to see!
"Did not expect such a quick and strong recovery, but will enjoy the ride."
So much for the “blood bath” today lol. Bears … go back into hibernation
I actually don’t mind seeing these prophets of doom posts. Usually their desperation is a good sign for a Z hike
Anybody knows why the after hours 2% rise? Hopefully it’s a sign of tomorrow’s action.
