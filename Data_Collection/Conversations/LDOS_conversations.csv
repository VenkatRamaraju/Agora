Wow huge after hours is this an error
Great earnings! Why down?
"Does any one know if they (LDOS) will be announcing a special dividend this year?? Seems like every year, in early July they give a special dividend."
LDOS is down 4.90% to $51.00
"""Our positive outlook is bolstered by the level of proposal activity. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 billion in submits outstanding of which $35 billion is new work for us."""
BAM!
"LDOS is one of the hidden Lion, waiting for the Defense deal to ink after election, Only player that US govt can share defense information and those project can never go to out sousing IT companies. lot of upside is waiting and they have diversified their business into healthcare and cloud computing. I am hopeful this to hit $110 by yearend,"
First time buyer today. Looks like its headed to $100 over the next 6-9 months.
I think these vulture class action lawyers mainly issue press releases - period.
Leidos is the main contractor for government and healthcare computer/information systems.I see a strong future and slow steady climb.
"Some executive, Maria Hedden is having an affair with two direct reports, Henry Vitali and Bill McGann. She is busted as I have been told. Let’s see if she is big enough to have a press release. There was something about a Ben Keeter being involved. Not sure."
Just purchased my first shares!
"Can I buy Leidos' stock now? I mean, is the stock available for anyone to buy? I like to buy some shares asap. Thank you."
LDOS reached an all time high at 113.00
LDOS at 67.03 Friday 1-12-2018
Any ideas when the NASA NEST contract win starts up?
Leidos is down 6.65% to 96.90
Tops earnings estimates by 45% and falls. Makes sense..
Nice dividend too
New contract for travelers verification. Great!
Credit Suisse Cut price target from $133 to $131. I can deal with that :) Wonder if that is the NYSE buyer?
Where is Leidos' competive edge compared to its peers? Looking forward to your comments.
LDOS reached an all time high at 105.83
The quiet stock that just keeps on rising - and paying dividends.
LDOS is up 8.53% to 122.43
Is this a joke?
Large open interest options position July 17 PUTS $85.
Earning has beat the expectations. Go LDOS Go.
Getting ready for the bounce back up. Indicators are looking bullish at foxchart. Long over 60.49 for a run up to 62.27.
"Anyone else notice the form 4's that were filed with the SEC, all the stock the executives were acquiring? I even noticed a CFO loading up. Cant wait to see the earnings in early August!"
Leidos is up 4.97% to 92.33
Leidos is up 4.96% to 92.84
This stock looks good.
LDOS is up 5.45% to 90.48
"Leidos ia going to pop. Zero long term impact from COVID. So it is artificially depressed. The analysts think so too, still way under analyst estimates. Load up now before this one takes off!"
Seems to me that the entire Aerospace and Defense sector stocks are all correcting led by Boeing. Save some available cash for when this turns.
Trifecta complete!12/12/2019 DISA GSM-O 6.5 billion contract awarded to Leidos12/16/2019 Hanford DOE 4.0 billion contract awarded to Leidos1/6 2020 NGEN 7.7 billion contract awarded to LeidosCongratulations All Leidos personnel !!!
Does anyone know on what date tendered LMT shares will actually convert to LDOS and be tradable?
I would like to invest in this but backlogs are down in Q4 by 25% in defense and health and flat in civil. Book to bill is below 1. EPS in Q4 are all from tax benefit. I think thye are struggling. The estimates are not reliable. Cash flow is $550 and 19x cash flow is a high valuation. too much hype in this name.
LDOS reached an all time high at 110.69
LDOS is up 4.92% to 70.16
lookin like a death cross
"This board wins the prize of dumbest message board in the history of the internet. Meanwhile, the stock's price is diving."
whoa Nellie? circuit breaker in effect.
"My dividend was in my bank account first thing Sunday morning, 21st."
Back to $124 in no time
LDOS gains nod to support Moon Lander. (Bloomberg) 4/30/2020This should add 10% for 5/1!!
let's go.. need 90
Best pizza in Washington DC ;)
Looks like the LDOS/LMT deal will be done in August and the LDOS dividend will be $13.64/share.
Short this stock at close and cover each morning !!!
Finally creeping back up towards 100! Giddy up
"Six months of Leidos…..Interesting….On August 16, 2016 Leidos stock was $51.84/share – this is the pre-merge price.On August 17, 2016 Leidos stock dropped to $38.20 because they gave out a $13.64 dividend.Today (actually tomorrow) is the 6 month anniversary of the split….On February 16, 2016 Leidos stock is opening at $51.62/share.So basically the Leidos shareholders received a $13.64 (a 26.3%) dividend for only 6 months.And the company is twice as big…."
love the growth since December lows. wish I'd bought more
"WOW&WOE!!Very narrow, extremely high tech device! Dept of Defense should buy co. as a closely held quasi gov‘t entity-in tightest oversight!

Now two business units from L3harris but with all debt.They seem to be going on a binge and debt isn't the way to it. Don't get fooled
"Great company, but why people are backing off?"
I'm a long looking for a dip to get back in bought Dec last yr
outstanding broke 100+with strong volume
Quite here
My understanding is that you have to tender LMT shares. The 10% discount is not guaranteed. Given that IS&GS produced ~9.25% of LMT profits last year I would not tender more than that but I am not sure I will tender any. My LMT is held in a 401K and I am not sure of the future tax implication if I tender for
back to March prices. I'm buying this dip if it drops to $91.
What is going on with LDOS? Less than a month 19% drop.
Leidos is one of a few companies reporting that should grow both earnings and revenues this first quarter 2020 (on May 5) and for the entire year 2020.
"A look at Leidos's competitors current PE (TTM) suggest Leidos has room to run.LDOS PE(TTM) 18.1SAIC "" 29.1BAH "" 22.9CACI "" 19.9MANT "" 31.2"
Why going low ?
Has LDOS said what their dividend policy will be going forward?
LDOS continues to power higher!! 90% of stocks that go into the lower 90s continue up to around 100-102. SAIC failed recently but I think LDOS will come through like a Champ on this possibility!!
LDOS reached a new All Time High at 66.36
"I think i just got in on the last possible day for the special divi...bought a small position today...it says my settle date of my shares is Aug 15, so i am hoping i get the special divi..if not not a huge deal, but it would be nice"
LDOS is up 4.92% to 84.79

This is going to 120 after earnings :)

"$123 is still a great price, I am looking for $150 and by years end."
"Leidos call was positive and earnings beat, revenue down as expected. Forward looking guidance was positive in-line with backlog. Good opportunity to get in or average-down."
"I believe the stock is now undervalued and have started to accumulate, no longer shorting. After spending the last week doing extensive research, I believe 2021 can be a big year for Leidos. Therefore I am now more in a buy and hold scenario. We shall see!"
Leidos is up 5.06% to 87.20
bought in at 103 and wishing I would have bought more.

Leidos just received 84.6 million from Virnetx related to a long term lawsuit against Apple. Should add substantially to EPS this quarter.

Does anyone know the details of their overlap with Palantir?
I'm hoping this Thursday's Investor's Day renews some optimism into the company's employees and investors. With the implantation of the 7.7 billion dollar NGEN contract finally up and running maybe the company can start running on all cylinders. The stock is down 20 percent since the announcement of winning the NGEN contract 2/6/2020.
Just added more under $91

Why in the world is this stock crashing? It had a great earnings report. I understand the panic selling but other stocks are rebounding and LDOS is lagging. Does not make sense.
What's going on today with LDOS? Down 1.24% on no news that I know of.

Adding to position today in anticipation of higher earnings and revenues.
"Earnings continue to beat. This continues to show the strength Leidos has in a diversified business both in government and commercial contracts. Very limited exposure to the downturn in the aeronautical business, unlike many other defense contractors. Pipeline just keeps breaking record numbers."
"A nice earning surprise, but yet another dip. People seem to be treating this stock unfairly even though it has a solid business and it’s area of services in the defense sector is unlikely to weaken if not grow."

4th Quarter contract awards should provide a boost. $99 target year end!
I don't like to see such a drop from a strong company it has done well since I bought about 56 but down from highs without any info from management
Was the $13+ sell off yesterday due to the dividend being paid? I heard it will be paid 8/22 but the sell-off yesterday may the movement of cash. Anyone know? Cheers!

Up 10% in one day and no reaction - not even spam. The quiet stock!
Pure crap. Are they seriously making this fuss over 6 mil for a company this large? The lawyers are going to make more than this rounding error. DAMN though. I'm taking the hit today
Why would the record date come before the ex-dividend date? Can't say I have ever seen this before. My understanding has always been that an ex-dividend date is dictated by stock exchange rules and is usually set to be two business days before the record date.
LDOS reached an all time high at 116.89
Management seems to be pretty weak. I have some friends there. They complain about management all the time. The name I hear the most is Kelly Hernandez. Some kind of EVP of Finance. Apparently she is incompetent and a ball buster. Constant turnover. Apparently she is on a short list to be the next CEO. Markets and Management are key to a companies success. The company is in the right markets.
Is this the Leidos with a subsidiary called Dynetics?
I'll take 8+dollar 5 day growth any day
LDOS is up 6.14% to 75.18
I did not trade LMT for LDOS but I did buy some shares of LDOS and captured the special dividend. Now LDOS is slowly moving back to the price I paid. It should double in a year or two from my original cost based on the revenue doubling due to purchase with some slight reduction due to additional debt. That was my basis for buying LDOS but who knows what will really happen to the stock market and LDOS valuation in the future. My best guess is that the S&P 500 will eventually hit 2217 from current level 2156 and LDOS should move with it.
LDOS is up 6.15% to 82.80

this is a repeat of Q1 report/reaction. I will add more at $91.

"Wow. Spruce Point has issued a report on Feb 16 targeting $LDOS, and the exact same set of bs law firms have offered their 'services' in the exact same words as they did for $MGNI. This copy-paste cannot be a coincidence."
"The impending Reverse Morris Trust with Lockheed Martin will trigger a special dividend of approx. $13.50 per share to Leidos stockholders when the deal closes later this year. Will this be based on all shares held when the deal closes, or just on shares that were held when the deal was announced on Jan 25 2016? If it's the latter, then does this explain the precipitous drop in LDOS just after the announcement? If it's the former, then how will this affect the price after the dividend is paid?"
why sell
what's with the DB short guy - you buy and then spread misinformation to make money? I would imagine an army of lawyers is on it right now. I assume twitter will block it haha
If you don’t buy and hold now You will regret soon
