"Some executive, Maria Hedden is having an affair with two direct reports, Henry Vitali and Bill McGann. She is busted as I have been told. Let’s see if she is big enough to have a press release. There was something about a Ben Keeter being involved. Not sure."
Just added more under $91
One of the Best Buy’s in the market right now.
looking back when 25 day m.a. moves below 50 day m.a. it has been more significant dip. dropping my buy order a bit. we are in time of year that is known for drops. i have been raising some cash from other stocks hitting unreasonable highs.
Tops earnings estimates by 45% and falls. Makes sense..
"Can I buy Leidos' stock now? I mean, is the stock available for anyone to buy? I like to buy some shares asap. Thank you."
One of only a few green tech stocks today. Very happy with Leidos
Where is Leidos' competive edge compared to its peers? Looking forward to your comments.
Leidos is one of a few companies reporting that should grow both earnings and revenues this first quarter 2020 (on May 5) and for the entire year 2020.
back to March prices. I'm buying this dip if it drops to $91.
"WOW&WOE!!Very narrow, extremely high tech device! Dept of Defense should buy co. as a closely held quasi gov‘t entity-in tightest oversight! Even to this amateur, commenter-do not want this patent out there! Great Uncle ran military&civilian sides of Groton‘s Electric Boat (now GD) during WWII! He‘d go nuts given the hap-hazard info (hope inaccurate) a bit of quick “DD” re. this holding co. that owns •THIS•, & all kinds of ordinary stuff-buildings, etc!GEN DYN should grab it up NOW!?M.M.A page colleague here lately commented re. (a paraphrase) the “flaky” individual in charge!! Really too loose for words!Best “security” for ALL! M.M."
"LDOS first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 by 16.1%. Moreover, the bottom line grew 45.4% from $1.19 per share registered a year ago.The company’s GAAP earnings of $1.42 per share improved from the year-ago quarter’s 80 cents.Total RevenuesLeidos Holdings generated total revenues of $3,315 million in the quarter under consideration, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,213 million by 3.2%. The top line also improved 14.7% year over year. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to program wins and a net increase in volumes on certain programs."
Management seems to be pretty weak. I have some friends there. They complain about management all the time. The name I hear the most is Kelly Hernandez. Some kind of EVP of Finance. Apparently she is incompetent and a ball buster. Constant turnover. Apparently she is on a short list to be the next CEO. Markets and Management are key to a companies success. The company is in the right markets.
I'm hoping this Thursday's Investor's Day renews some optimism into the company's employees and investors. With the implantation of the 7.7 billion dollar NGEN contract finally up and running maybe the company can start running on all cylinders. The stock is down 20 percent since the announcement of winning the NGEN contract 2/6/2020.
"News story on govconwire, Leidos secures over $5 B in contract wins in June"
"Oct. 6, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Leidos (NYSE:LDOS), a FORTUNE 500 science and technology leader, was recently awarded a five-year single award contract by the National Security Agency (NSA). Through this award, which holds a ceiling value of $300 million, Leidos will provide development and modernization efforts in support of the NSA's Technical Signals Intelligence (TechSIGINT) mission."
it's good this is down over the past week. Leidos is a great company and their financials look great for the warning report in 2 weeks. I'm loading up!
"Wow. Spruce Point has issued a report on Feb 16 targeting $LDOS, and the exact same set of bs law firms have offered their 'services' in the exact same words as they did for $MGNI. This copy-paste cannot be a coincidence."
"LDOS is one of the hidden Lion, waiting for the Defense deal to ink after election, Only player that US govt can share defense information and those project can never go to out sousing IT companies. lot of upside is waiting and they have diversified their business into healthcare and cloud computing. I am hopeful this to hit $110 by yearend,"
"A nice earning surprise, but yet another dip. People seem to be treating this stock unfairly even though it has a solid business and it’s area of services in the defense sector is unlikely to weaken if not grow."
