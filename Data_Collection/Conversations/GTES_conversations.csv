"I wanted to invest in this as I know the company well and have always used their products and really like to support traditional American based manufacturing but the statement that one poster mentioned about the high debt load made me look at the financials a lot closer and he was right. When 60% of your assets are goodwill and intangible assets and you have a huge long/short term debt load it causes one to be reticent to invest. I would have to see how they manage their debt load for a couple of years before I can feel comfortable with investing in this one. I will have to stick with CMI, ITW and DE. Good luck to the longs, I intend on keeping a hand on the pulse, I wish the company well."
Gates Industrial is down 5.05% to 15.61
GTES is up 56.35% to 15.51
In 2014 Blackstone paid $18.62 a share!!!! Insiders are buying in at the 13 range.No brainer
Give us some good earnings
GTES is up 5.06% to 16.00
"When I see an insider who has never bought step up and buy $1mil worth, it makes me think it's at the buying range. Seems like it has the profit to get through this dip. What am I missing? Why is this still falling?"
Gates Industrial reached a 52 Week high at 15.27
"You'd think a company that started out making rubber casings for wagon wheels and is an industrial leader for belts and hose products would be in better financial health.....I guess this happens when the kids, grandkids and great grandkids take over then sell the company to a hedge fund that runs the debt up more and then attempts to take the company public.....reduce the debt by 90% and Gates could be a good investment."
Great earnings
Blackstone sold 90% of its shares in this yesterday. $365m worth
Gates Industrial reached a 52 Week high at 15.06
GTES reached a new All Time Low at 15.44
Since analysts upgraded the stock is going down.Any comments why?
This is a spectacular quarterã€‚Stock is worth $30.
Just wanted to be the first person posting! And just maybe we can all make money on this stock!
"Company puts out earnings release ""strong results""...then does not give out numbers that are easy to compare to analysts estimates. All i see is a company that missed estimates and guided lower....and is not trading at very expensive levels...they did do one thing well...pricing the ipo at 19."
"still not buying. Stock still expensive. Add to that, we are probably coming to the end of current economic cycle. Might consider it around $15 but will probably just wait for the economy to tank. The economy is fragile and will not be able to withstand the upcoming rate hikes."
This will significantly boost the amount of cash per share. If the infra-structure bill passes they will need cash to take advantage of this and for future growth and expansion expansion. As long as they are using the cash wisely......as evidenced by earnings and revenue beats it is a good thing for shareholders. Blackstone all ready has a huge stake in this company. Making Gates more profitable is to their advantage if they want to sell all or part of their stake in the company. Or for that matter buy up the remaining shares and take it private.
Good numbers. To be discovered.

Should have been valued more than this
Great earnings. This stock should be at $25
GTES is up 5.01% to 16.15
"At 14 its a BUY, target is 18 near term"
Wonderful! 5 of 6 analysts come out with BUY or Overweight ratings yesterday and stock tanks today? Interesting how it almost falls back to its 52 week low $17.55 (I know IPO was only 7 weeks ago). I'm guessing it closes the day with 1.0 MM shares traded vs 500K traded at 3:20 pm. The Bigs always get their share.
Bye Gates. Thanks for the memories. 130% profit was a nice 1-year play.

Gates Industrial is up 4.97% to 17.73
The best stock that nobody owns. Doubled in a year with virtually no buzz.
"Pretty darn low volume for the stock trading down ~7%. No buyers? Manipulation of a relatively thinly traded stock, via short-raid? Article about debt load? Tough call, but thinking of buying more at this price."
Something good must be in the wind. 2.3 million shares traded today.
Very quiet here! Very undervalued. Blackstone loves GTES ! Lets see if we can go to $20.00
