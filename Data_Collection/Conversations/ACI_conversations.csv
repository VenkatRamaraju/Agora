Gaps in price are 95% filled. The gap at 25 should be filled so buckle up for more downside.
"ACI: Barclays investments firm upgraded Albertsons to Equal weight, price target $27 and currently it isat $28. Was it overbought and price should be $27 the highest or the analyst missed it."
I don’t think ACI has the support to stay at these levels. It may drop to mid 20’s before some resistance is seen.
Massive chatter on $ACI could go to 50.00 in a blink of an eye!

$ACI ready to roll!
"Albertsons is a great company. The consensus for the market was to wait a year after the IPO and then buy the stock. Well done, the plan is coming to fruition, now we have lots of buyers (TY shorts), a new CFO, and the stock is soaring. Glad I bought in at 14 (easy home run). Not bad for a supposed boring stock."
Where are my dear bears???

ACI - a great company and great management! Good job ACI.
Look at the 6 month chart. Bearish Head and shoulders pattern Confirmed. The Head and Shoulders chart pattern is the most reliable Bearish indicator.Next Leg is Straight Down. This is very typical for this type of pump and dump Market Manipulation scheme.
Get your candy at Albertsons and Vons! Woo hoo- trick or treat - up up we go little bears!
"Did space-X hook up a rocket ship to this beauty? In 5-years you are gonna look back at this one and say, man, this was a $13 stock at some point? I wish I would have got in back then...LONG"
Since when this becomes a meme stock.
Buffet bought more Krogers but not one share of aci should tell us something. Buffett doesn’t invest in criminals and their collection of leveraged buyouts that are milked for their assets

"Rite Aid.Now is the time for ACI to go back to the table , with a one for one share swap. What do you think?"
Wish I'd bought ACI a year ago instead of RAD. Both were $16.
$ACI Picking up steam.
just bought 500 More..
Albertsons Companies is up 5.04% to 26.04
cycle to $16. Hoping it will break through this time and run to $20s.
"Are the three bears still around? What do you know, this stock has doubled in the last year!"
Going to crash !
What’s your favorite Halloween candy?
"Hey to all my shorties, get in the kitchen and make me some pie! Go ACI"
Great company.
Great stock!
Best stock ever !!!
Bear raid
"Constant ""feel-good"" pumper pieces from Paid media shill Zack's on crack, constant artificial pumping withobvious HFT laddering algos, constantly ""Painting the Tape high"" right before close, this is looks like a typicalC'bus pump and Dump Market Manipulation Scheme."
"Way under rated stock - ACI stock price should be at least as the same price of Kroger (KR), at $45."
"I will state this for those who are wondering why there is a sudden increase in ACI value. Most of the grocery chains are trading well above 20 P/E right now (Target, Walmart, Costco, etc). Albertsons and Kroger are barely above 10 P/E. P/E is basically the evaluation you should use to determine whether a stock is under or overvalued in its market. Given that the other chains are trading much higher P/E, it is perfectly understandable that Albertsons and Kroger are having a price increase and it should continue."
"Yesterday the SEC announced they will be working with the FBI to investigate and prosecute cases of corporate wrongdoing. Hopefully, they take a closer look at this suspected Pump and Dump IPO scheme: The Hedge Fund backers behind this stock IPO Scheme only floated 25% of the worth-less non-voting shares at IPO, so they could easily manipulate the S.P. in the open Market, using the $300 million taken from the employees’ pension plan, by using the majority of voting-shares-appointed BOD’s “buyback plan” to pump up the approximately 75% privately held controlling shares they got for practically nothing. The board announcing its “stock buyback plan” almost immediately after the IPO shows that this alleged Market Manipulation Scheme was planned out and orchestrated from the very beginning. They should also investigate the suspicious insider information trading of the CEO and BOD members that bought shares of the company for their own accounts, right before announcing their $300 Million stock ""buyback plan"" designed to artificially inflate the Stock Price in the open Market, along with privately owned shares. It's this type of devious activity by corporate malfeasants that give Wall Street a bad image."
"Suspicious End-of-Day Trading activity: ""Painting the Tape High"" before close. Look at the 5 day chart:"
This pizza couldn’t ipo above 16 and had to manipulate the pps a month after the ipo using the stores money that was cut from the employees pension. Now Wall Street is trying to pump this shell trying to convince it’s undervalued or something. If you buy at these levels it your money will be in quick sand.

"If Alberton’s makes 600 million over the next two quarters, not unlikely, the stock is still trading at just above a 10 P/E"
lets see if my $28 and $30 calls print for earnings
