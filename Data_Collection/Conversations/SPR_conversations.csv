They had some interesting insights about SPR on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This Dreamliner news is temporary. Three more weeks. Quarterly report. 52 week low in the 30s. That alone should bounce price to 60s plus. Add to that China lifting Max restrictions and placing YUGE order? Fughettaboutit! 
In another couple of months the 52 week low will be in the $30s instead of $17. Coupled with another positive quarterly report we should see lots of action. Add to that some big news and it's fuel to its . 
China will either buy from BA soon or be left behind. They can ill afford to let that happen.
RBC Capital: upgrade to $62
"WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said it was offering $482.3 million in aviation manufacturing assistance to 313 businesses, including up to $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (SPR)."
Hate to even say this but what else can be messed up with the Dreamliner production? Hoping nothing.
$52 by this Friday!
"I was looking at Airbus for comparison and see that they are having supply chain issues and may not make their deliveries, lots of the parts may be the same as Boeing, we will most likely see the same issue here. I can see Spirit facing the same supply shortages, unfortunately this supply chain issue is not improving fast enough and may affect the bottom line. Let's hope for the best and prepare for the worst."
it's one of those rare days that SPR isn't attached at the hip with BA.
SPR and BA upgraded to outperform by Bernstein 
"another 7% up this week, and a great day all around for the market. I will enjoy my weekend even more. Everyone enjoy your!"
Stocks like this and BA are completely under the control of hedge fund traders and solely used to trade options against the Dow.
"Folks, this stock has been a rollercoaster. It doesn’t take much to knock it. The article on the 787 was the latest excuse to beat up on it. I am not minimizing this issue (although it is much less significant for SPR than BA notwithstanding SPR getting hit much harder than BA yesterday). I would like it to get resolved sooner rather than later. But it seems more likely than not that we are in the later innings of this issue and there are other positives that longs are well aware of. If your timeframe is more than a few days or weeks and especially if it is potentially multiyear, then the stock would seem to be attractive at these levels. Try not to get the daily nonsense frustrate you too much (yes, easier said than done at times, I know)."
SPR BA UAL DAL LUV should be up today....
The week of Nov 15th will begin with a 52week low of $32. Interested to see what psychological benefit it may have for the per share price.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"SPR and BA trade in inverse to AAPL. Today AAPL is up and surprise, surprise SPR is down."
"SPR, an almost monopoly, costructing major parts for BA and Airbus. it's a steal at this price."
"This is a good long term investment. I don't have many units here because I am focused now on short term/profitable plays. However, if I had plenty of money and did not want to risk it, I would definitely invest here....i think this should double in 2 to 3 years."
