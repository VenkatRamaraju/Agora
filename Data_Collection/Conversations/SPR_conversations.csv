"More demand means more business for SPR.""(Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Tuesday it delivered 29 aircraft in March, up from 20 a year earlier, with the U.S. planemaker's net orders staying positive for the second straight month as airlines get ready for a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.The company's orders appear to be turning a corner after the coronavirus crisis caused airline customers to cancel hundreds of jets on orders last year, resulting in one of the worst performances for Boeing ever.Boeing's net orders turned positive for the first time in 14 months in February as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts boosted the confidence of its customers. The plane manufacturer said it booked March gross orders of 196 aircraft, all of them for its 737 family of jets. Net of cancellations and conversions, Boeing had 40 jet orders for its 737 planes last month.Boeing said its March gross orders include previously announced 100 737 MAX orders for Southwest and 24 737 MAX orders for private investment firm 777 Partners and 11 orders for P8 military aircraft.Turkish Airlines canceled 10 737 MAX airplane orders in March and converted 40 737 MAX jet orders to options.China's CDB Financial scrapped 16 737 MAX orders last month and China Aircraft Leasing canceled 26 737 MAX orders.Alaska Air and United Airlines respectively recontracted nine and 25 737 MAX orders last month for earlier delivery positions.Nineteen 737 MAX orders were canceled by unidentified customers in March.Boeing's gross orders for the first quarter were 282 airplanes. Net of cancellations and conversions, orders stood at 69 aircraft in the quarter. Adjusted for stricter accounting standards, Boeing's net orders were 76 airplanes in the first quarter ended March.Boeing's official backlog rose to 4054 aircraft orders in March from 4041 orders in February.The company delivered a total of 77 airplanes in the first quarter, up from 50 aircraft a year earlier. Boeing resumed 787 jet deliveries in late March after halting them for four months due to production defects."""
time for SPR stock to break away from BA since it is less tied to it than it ever was.
Close BA down for 90 days and see how the world does without them. They will pay $600 a share to get them opened again.
I was sure that I would not get Put shares on my $37 Sept 17 options...I might have to close it early as I don't want to get put shares of SPR now.
"Boeing posted its first quarterly profit in almost two years, as deliveries of its best-selling 737 MAX jets to airlines gained traction amid a sharp rebound in travel bookings following an increase in global COVID-19 vaccinations!The 737 MAX is integral to Boeing's financial recovery. It's going to be a big week for SPR"
"Gail, any chance you could clean up some of these posts every ½ hour? I appreciate the updates about your frustration. I feel I am now aware and can do w/o them."
maybe a decent dip today to add to my stash! Vaccines beginning distribution means people begin to fly again soon.
2022 is right around the corner and it will bring huge growth in the aircraft industry.
Its time to get into this stock below $40. Airlines are opening back up and adding flights for the summer. Boeing is shooting up and SPR is your shot. Holding this until we get back to $65+.
I think hedge funds have tweaked their algorithms to achieve maximum annoyance for Gail and they just have daily meetings going over the comments
this stock went from 90 to 20 in 6 months on concern that boeing would even survive.....now that it's clear that boeing will be fine it should gradually come back as business comes back
@Ha definitely a buy. Do your DD but if you look Spirit over you'll love this company. It will be difficult to catch up to last year (as will all aviation related companies) but it has trimmed the fat and started to divest into multiple areas of manufacturing. Down more than 50% as of today it has a good path a greater pps.Any news this week about relief from a Congressional bill will give this and ma y companies an instant boost!Make your own judgement.

"BREAKING - Bloomberg United Airlines Holdings Inc. is in advanced talks for a large narrow-body aircraft order that would include at least 100 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets as part of a broader fleet revamp, according to people close to the matter.The Chicago-based airline sees an opportunity to upgrade its fleet and is studying several new, fuel-efficient models at a time when the likes of Boeing and Airbus SE are hungry for deals and demand for leisure travel is surging in the U.S., said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are confidential."
"Many of my friends work for this company. The company is struggling just like any aviation company in this environment. I see this as an opportunity to leverage down and buy more. The company first took a hit with the 737 Max deal and then covid hit a months later...prior to all of that, it was in the 80s and 90s. Will it get back to 80s and 90s in the next year, probably not, but 50s, maybe 60s...I would think so. This is a long term play, not a short play."

Pfizer vaccine 90% effective at preventing covid....SPR going to the moon!
BA shows profit up +3.8 .. SPR will be up 5 % today . I’m buying at 45 .
"I'm still a buyer at $43. This is a gift. Some delays and repairs, but nothing awful happened. This will rebound soon."
We were higher than this in February. They have held this down here basically over 6 months even in the face of a travel recovery. Time for this to get back close to $50.
"I was looking at Airbus for comparison and see that they are having supply chain issues and may not make their deliveries, lots of the parts may be the same as Boeing, we will most likely see the same issue here. I can see Spirit facing the same supply shortages, unfortunately this supply chain issue is not improving fast enough and may affect the bottom line. Let's hope for the best and prepare for the worst."
"Who will be the first manufacturer to build and test a legacy design with Spirit’s new CFFP, fuselage panels? No panels means making a composite barrel, with panels could allow easier manufacturing, and major repair ability. The tools used for the trainer eliminated shimming. Imagine a NMA with no shims, CFFP, and CFRP wings. Boeing is researching their next moves, and they want to win... It will have CFRP wings, Japan, and Everett make those.https://www.spiritaero.com/pages/release/spirit-develops-new-carbon-fiber-fuselage-panel-to-support-lower-cost-higher-production-volumes-for-aircraft-manufacturing"
just wonder where spr will be by October: same forties or at least sixties? I hold over 14 months already and not gonna sell for 12 months more. glta
"When a company like (SPR ) earns over $4.60 a share and is trading under $30.00 a share ,and than you have (LULU ) that earned just over $4.00 a share and is trading over $300.00 a share a big disconnect on wall street"
"Nice article in Forbes opining that Spirit has enough cash to survive their forecasted worst-case scenario: ""We find that in the worst case, it will consume more than $300 million in cash. Quite a bit of burn but fortunately, it has a sufficient cash cushion to take the hit...In the second scenario, where revenue declines by 50%, the company could post losses of $-626 million and its free cash flow could drop to $-233 million. This is quite likely as Spirit saw its revenue drop nearly 45% in the quarter ending April 2, 2020. Not a very rosy scenario but not too bad either, considering the drop in revenue and current market conditions. In addition, the company had nearly $2.35 billion of cash at the beginning of the year. At the end of March, this cash pile reduced to $1.83 billion but still quite comfortable given the expected cash outflow this year. Overall, we believe the company can safely navigate the current crisis which might aid its stock recovery as demand starts to rebound.""Google ""With Boeing Pessimistic, Should Spirit Aerosystems’ Investors Stay In High Spirits?"" to find the article."
"So what is your plan to convince people to give away shares down here after today's Fed meeting? Just curious how you shorts think. 2M went through TSA lines last weekend, BA Max inventory almost depleted, UAL deal coming soon, SPR stock seriously over sold............................. You get the drift."
"https://www.webull.com/news/41503955For what it's worth, CFRA Maintains Strong Buy on shares of Spirit as per link"
When 50 ????????????
"Three weeks ago, I thought the bottom would be $18 in worst case. With the lack of Stimulus, $16 may be the new bottom...I am basing that on no stimulus, no vaccine and layoffs in Airline industry...A long term investor could really profit with a buy here...looking at 2016-2018 as reference points, this company was doing the right things before 737 Max and the virus...It will rise from the ashes"
"By Daniel McCoy – Reporter, Wichita Business JournalJul 6, 2021, 2:23pm EDTShort sellers are abandoning the ship as Spirit swings into growth-mode."
This stock is undervalued fundamentally.
"Beautiful chart on the upside since Oct. 28th. Over 100% since close of that day. Hoping another 100% from here until summer of 2021, maybe? Most of us longs are playing with house money right about now I presume? 60 will probably arrive quicker than I anticipated. Happy TGDay to everyone."
Boeing up due to increase in deliveries for 737 max. And who supplies boeing with the fuselages amongst other parts for 737 max? That’s right SPR.
"When considering to buy today or tomorrow ask yourself, what will push it up tomorrow? Nothing. I've made this mistake many times, its a pass for me today."
"WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said it was offering $482.3 million in aviation manufacturing assistance to 313 businesses, including up to $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (SPR)."
"what's everyone's short, mid, and long-term outlook on SPR? I don't think the airlines industry is as bearish in the short-term as the news outlets make it seem. Travel should come back quick in my opinion."
SPR diverse its portfolio since the pandemic. This will reach $100.
"Does SPR have enough money to avoid bankruptcy as the demand for planes is going to be very low over the next 18 months? I ask this because another supplier wen into bankruptcy. Where are most of their planes manufactured in the states, are they in north Carolina ? Thanks, dave"
"Any airline looking to retire older, fuel inefficient airframes will be putting in huge orders for the MAX and others even if they are a number of years ahead of pre pandemic plans...why...HISTORICALLY LOW...GENERATIONALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. They know the post pandemic recovery will drive massive revenue in the coming years and money WILL NEVER BE THIS CHEAP AGAIN"
SPR will have a long recovery but make no mistake it will recover. I bought 6800 shares at $24.78 several months back and then recently bought another 1000 shares at $47. i plan on holding until $90 to $100 range but i expect that's at least 2 years away.
I remember when this stock hit 17.5$ two weeks ago and I told everyone to buy as it would hit 20$ in no time. Same advice people. it's only going up. Mark my words.
Why the sell off on no news today? The PPS should be a lot higher
I like that the volume is up. New retail eyeballs? 
I said I hoped for $50 by end of the week. Now I'm hoping for $55. That would be another great ceiling to break. Let's go Spirit!
"Spirit Airlines' $4.0B cash on hand can last 1,758,33 days WITHOUT using their revolving credit lines and paying debt payments on time."

Not sure how this ever got below this price in the first place but glad it do so I could add shares.
Trapped here a while... opportunities lost make money elsewhere.
Easy stock too catch big long term gains on
with the Maxx back in service Spirit will be busy again! Add more people in countries around the world getting vaccinated and suffering from cabin fever and missing loved ones the travel business should be excellent on 2021. Spr has away to go to recover but plenty of room to grow! GO Spirit
We are now the same as we were on 8/25 of 2014 if you can believe that one. Talk about way oversold!
Its definitely a perfect storm of negatives. The irony is that this company is doing well considering. It's the other viables and variants causing the market to bleed. Keep holding.
"I feel today’s drop is a big over reaction. The triple 7 doesn’t account for major revenue numbers for spirt. Although it doesn’t help, it will affect Boeing more than spirit. I added more on today’s drop at $47.50"
China will either buy from BA soon or be left behind. They can ill afford to let that happen.
Spirit AeroSystems is down 5.36% to 38.12
the slowdown in business is has already been figured into share price
"Airlines need airplanes no matter what… it’s a cycle, they need new airplanes every 25 to 30 years. Even if travel demand is down they need new airplanes anyway. There’s a pilot shortage for a reason… more people are traveling today than 10 years ago. The demand for air cargo is also increasing thanks to e-commerce. Without mentioning defense which is another big part of the business. I invested on SPR and BA because of this but unfortunately some investors don’t do their dd and end up selling on great and sustainable companies like these two. Once they realize they made a mistake they will come back and put their money in. At some point long term investors will be rewarded. Patience is key!"
"SPR ,BA Fuselage in front problems ??"
"SPR to $200 within five years...Why;They are diversifying customer baseIncreasing market dominance Hyperloop worldwideThe CABAL is burning dollars at a record pace. So the value of dollars goes down, anything of value increasesShall we say $100 by Christmas "
Be sure I am adding on the close another 4000 shares.
"@Gail short sellers are no different from longs. they think can make money by shorting as we think long is better strategy to make money. price is determined by all buyers and sellers. in fact, you wouldn't have accumulated your holdings at 44~ without the short sellers. in the long run, when more investors share your outlook on SPR, short sellers will leave the town..."
SPR needs to detach from BA as it is more than BA business.
This drop today is is about a overspending Congress not the value of SPR.
Soon they will be paying us to take shares. LOL
"This week two positive pieces of news. China orders planes from Boeing strictly for commercial use. Then Southwest orders up to 500 more Max for route expansion. One more and we have a 3 stage rocket to break through the stratosphere. Maybe China announces approval of Max for travel? If so, we could have a nice frenzy going on Tuesday. Remember when Kodak went up 1500%? I'm not greedy. Will be very happy with a 200-300% bump from here."
Look at the chart pre Max ordeal... this company is in a better shape now than ever before. Incredible potential both from financial strength to new growth targets. My #1 position and will be holding strong for years to come.
"No matter how good a company is, unless investors know about it the price will stagnate and decline. SPR needs a new PR head.Second time posting this. Will try and try again until it posts. So forgive potential duplicates."
if this drops below $46 I will load up. This is a great price for Spirit AeroSystems. This will be double within 2 years. Possibly less if we can get a businessman into the WH.
"Same option game, new week."
Will big gain soon. Good time to buy now. Long term in vest.
Added 1000 and will add more if it goes under $42.
congrats who bought at 17usd before election and sold and gonna re buy on 21 soon. maan you are one lucky fella i say
Close the doors and lock them. See what the world does when no one is there to build aircraft and travels stops.
Max will get recertified after exhaustive testing. Once that happens the backlog will move out. Patience is required for this long term hold.
"With the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars going into infrastructure, why are they wasting it in Amtrak and not investing in New technology like Hyperloop? Hoped Gephardt would have had influence."
Republican party will accept the $2.4T stimulus package next week that will help the airline and travel sector greatly!
"Despite expectations of heavier losses next year,the analysts have lifted their price target 5.7% to US$42.06, perhaps implying these losses are not expected to be recurring over the long term. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean."
Long term hold In at 19.80 - 5k shares.
SPR nicely green on a red market day.
"Makes no sense to sell even with the huge rally off the lows. It is still way off the highs. It'll take years to get to all time highs, but no reason for it not to be able to get to mid 30s in the next few days"
+8% for the week. That's how I like to start the weekend! 
Super cheap
I still hope to see $50 by the end if the week. We are just looking at some market corrections going on right now. GLTA 
"Guys, Don't be afraid small waves. Never sell your stocks until next December 2021. We are solid uptrend."
"$BA $GE $SPRBoeing still has 4398 jets in the back log; this is more than 7 years worth or work and profits#The combined changes, plus nine 737NG deliveries this year, left Boeing’s Max backlog at 3,543 jets at the end of July, down 19% from 4,398 jets at the end of 2019, data shows."""
"The Spirit AeroSystems Analyst: Kristine Liwag upgraded the rating for Spirit AeroSystems Holdings from Underweight to Overweight, while raising the price target from $18 to $50."
Looks like hedge fund Elliot took a large position in SPR. Gotta admit the price drop from 90 looks attractive now. Undervalued and essential to Boeing and Airbus.
glad we haven't been taking it on the chin like the rest of the market today. 
"As long as the 737-max is flying, this will double in 2 years (maybe 1 year). Better play than BA for sure."
hopefully buy end of the year we should see more contracts coming to Boeing no that the 737 Max has been approved for return to the air. Just need the new software/firmware to be updated in all jets along with some new training for pilots. Good news still
Bottom line is BA and SPR are grossly over sold stocks.
"I expect some profit taking today, but be careful because this could pop at the first bit of good news."
Just like I said 3 hours ago.
Go go go spr .. Almost two years now aviation industry struck in pandemic. Needs overall all planes  only SPR help to out.
Question: what makes a spaceship break through the atmosphere? Answer: a multi-stage rocket. We have an opportunity for a multi-stage pop which will send this stock soaring. Stage one: CDC guideline change to Masks being purely voluntary. Stage 2: Boeing's guidance tomorrow. Stage 3: a positive earnings report next Wednesday.
"lots of buyers, no real sellers left."
Another vaccine just hit the market and travel is completely over sold.
"We have seen before that after a -7% day we can have +8% today. But I don’t mind. Long term vision, this company is very solid."
It seems Virgin Hyperloop is using Spirit to build pods. Since it appears the current protocol for tubes is steel. However I believe Spirit’s expertise with composites will rock Hyperloops around the world. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zcikLQZI5wQ
it's one of those rare days that SPR isn't attached at the hip with BA.
buy good companies stock when it is down. Buy SPR.
Even if you wait 4 yrs for this to return to pre covid level..you will make 300+ percent returns
Who's ready to be splurging all these gains on good assets/maybe a couple babes and cars in the future? These cheap prices will pay off HUGE! #DDTG $PLAY $KSS $SPR $CCL $CAKE $ERI
It is hard to imagine investors overlooking this for long down here.
"I have been accumulating shares of SPR, it’ll be rewarding in a couple of years. Good luck everyone."
"This thing is not only about aviation, they are working with virgin hyperloop project as well. Hyperloop idea came from Elon not that long ago - it’s great inovation. Big upside potential here in my opinion, not mentioning coop with BA."
$SPR $VENA It's evident in the daily chart. Not in yet but will be ready
Adding adding and adding some more.
"re-market gains going to hold for once, $SPR $VENA"
"Be sure to tie-up your shares with high limit orders, $60, $90, $120...The percentage of float shorted is growing past 6%...It’s said over 10% becomes a good squeeze candidate.For those that don’t know. Placing a sell limit order takes your shares out of the float-loan pool..."
"another 7% up this week, and a great day all around for the market. I will enjoy my weekend even more. Everyone enjoy your!"
"Gail, you gonna have a stroke. No matter what happens you know SPR is a solid company and will be double this price next year."
Ho hum. Take it lower so we can all add more.
"I am not talking politic but the way the congress is spending our money rubs against the way I manage and invest my money. Take this into consideration the next time you vote, would you?"
Test flight left BA today bound for China and their test flight to recertify the MAX. This drop was orchestrated to steal shares no doubt about it.
India reinstates the 737 Max. Buy this and every dip from here.
"Today’s action looked like it was wrapped around options expiration. I was watching level II and realized the call board doesn’t even keep up with the real numbers... MMs made some serious coin on the side today, it’s also a quick way for them to seize control of shares. I didn’t realize how they can play the fiddle when they want to... study... The stock price is certainly being held down, in favor of parting shares from loose fingers. SPR will POP, Pop, & pop!"
"$50 by New Years, increase in BA orders, or more Hyperloop news whichever occurs last."
$SPR Supplies boeing with 737 max components! A win win for both companies!
"This is a good long term investment. I don't have many units here because I am focused now on short term/profitable plays. However, if I had plenty of money and did not want to risk it, I would definitely invest here....i think this should double in 2 to 3 years."
Southwest is reportedly in talks with Boeing and GE for a potentially huge 737 Max order as the carrier looks to refresh its fleet.
"""FAA demands emergency inspection of all Boeing 777s after mid-air explosion ripped engine into pieces"" I wonder how this will affect Spirit. I guess I am wondering what, if am it will have on the stock price. I know it will depend on the findings. My initial gut feeling is there will be a small pullback in BA, which usually transfers over to SPR. I know that Spirit manufacturers the fuselage, nacelles, and struts for the 777, and the engines are made by GE. Just wondering what others thoughts are on it?"
"not bad ER for Boeing ... narrower loss than expected, increased liquidity, ditched Embraer deal to focus on core backlog ... translates well for SPR"
"I told a lot of people to buy last spring below $20, they’re happy now. There’s plenty of room before more resistance."
"Analyst has BA a buy with $270 price target, just now on CNBC - SPR will be $40!!!!!!!!!!!"
"it's a Friday and we are higher than we have been for the past few weeks so I'm expecting this to dip into the red at close today, but I think it's temporary and will be back up again Monday for a great weekHope I'm wrong though!"
"Let's have a caffeine free day today Gail! More money, less panic Go SPR"
This was my only stock with a positive return for the day.
Up to 100$ by end of Q2/2022 if BA get thier act together

The company applied advanced digital design techniques to continue to advance the affordability of robotic manufacturing and industrialization."
$60 by end of next week regardless of how hard these hedge funds try to hold it back all day every day.
Added in premarket.
SPR and BA upgraded to outperform by Bernstein 
wonder why Boeing released outlook on China now?
"Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) investors should pay attention to an increase in enthusiasm from smart money of late. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) was in 44 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 50."
not a single reason to be red today.
turning into #$%$ ???
we have reached a new 6 month high! Hopefully now that the economy is opening back up and travel season has started; increases in demand will bring BA and SPR BOOMING forward!
This stock is NOT about past earnings right now. Its all about FUTURE earnings as the airlines all around the world order new planes!!!
Never sees $37 again and sees $50 by Nov.
"Nothing against, but more Gail texts, lower spr goes. Maybe to try another pattern?"
SPR will be in the 40s soon. We need to invest more money in SPR. Get up!! guys! Go ahead~~ to 80$ per share~
Today close over $43 with China certification coming soon over $60
Any word on when how the China max test going? Hoping if approved could pop this back over 40.
"Hyperloop, Boeing, and AirBus are customers. Plus they have qualified carbon fiber panels, able to reduce an airplanes weight 5%. What’s not to like. This company will be better than before. I see a ceiling-of-resistance within 2-years at $120. Then as revenue begins to make it all better... breakout to the upside. Value stands the test of time..."
"The Boeing 737 MAX may soon be in the air again. The European aviation authority EASA is about to give the aircraft a green light, EASA director Patrick Ky told Bloomberg news agency on Friday. With the approval, aircraft maker Boeing is taking a step towards its goal of getting the 737 MAX back on the air before the end of this year.EASA makes the decision after a number of test flights in September. ""Our analysis is that the aircraft is safe and the safety level is high enough for us,"" Ky told Bloomberg. According to the director, the safety level can be further improved, but that is not a requirement to be allowed to air again.The European aviation authority is the first to give the green light for the popular aircraft. The American aviation authority FAA has not yet approved the aircraft. The FAA made a test flight with the aircraft at the end of last month.Ky expects the necessary paperwork to be sent out next month. This is followed by a further period of four weeks during which other parties may respond to the green light from the aviation authority.In March last year, the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after two aircraft of this type crashed in rapid succession in Indonesia and Ethiopia. A total of 346 occupants were killed.Source:https://www.nu.nl/economie/6084358/europese-luchtvaartautoriteit-boeing-737-max-veilig-genoeg-om-mee-te-vliegen.html(translated from Dutch)"
$SPR $VENA I’ve watched so much Dateline
"First time buyer here with SPR. Looking at the fundamentals and recent stock price, it seems like a great buy. I’m in at $23.41 with more ammunition to use. How low do you think it could go considering their entire business relies heavily on new planes being built? I saw the pop that BA gave it when they said they’re restarting 737 max production but it gave up all of those gains then some.Honest opinions are appreciated!"
I wish all Spirit stock holders a Happy New Years and may this stock double or triple for all.
"""After 14 months of turmoil that included the 737 Max grounding and the coronavirus pandemic, Boeing had more orders than cancellations in February."" Great news for Spirit"

I’m in at $34.15. Long term this is a solid play. I expect in the $40s again next week

"Last night, after market, 400 shares were traded at $42.50. Just like the last time an after market trade brought it down to $43.50. What's going on? Who's doing this? Is it a signal between hedge funds what to do the next day? It doesn't take me off of this stock at all. I know what I know about the stock and I'm sticking with it no matter what. I'm looking at the big picture. Patience is an acquired taste. Or one forced upon you by circumstance."
"Good news these days. China market is a big one for Boeing & SPR. Also within a couple of months Air France/KLM will anounce their large order. Boeing has a good history with KLM, hopefully lots of 737MAX orders."
Boeing and Spr's performance shows the airline industry's return pace is faster than analysts expected
CC is not bad actually and SPR is grossly under valued here.
This is one washed out stock for sure as is BA.

Only lower 1 time since last December and in the midst of a recovery? I am adding here.
The creditability of the U.S. here and abroad is taking a down turn and will affect the market negatively as well.
now. Is this what it feels like to make it. Feels nice knowing we’ve already won just have to hold. $SPR
The Afghanistan withdraw debacle impacted the investment sentiment negatively. Not a political talk. Just saying.
I will add under $40.
Dont understand how CCL which has almost 0 revenue is green today while SPR which beaten estimates is down 3%.
Not so easy attacking travel as oversold as it all is here. If Trump were in office SPR would be over $65.
"I don't see it going much lower. The drop to $43 on the 25th was a major fluke. It rebounded really quick. That says there is value at $43. It is going to rise with Boeing orders over the next few quarters. The 737 has been signed off for flight months ago, the 787 is going to come back, the 800+ cancelled planes are going to be reordered at better prices for each of the airlines, SPR has better government contracts for bombers, other countries are adding order to SPR build. I see it at $70+ by December. A big jump in price is when SPR puts out a statement towards the summer (my guess) that they are rehiring a portion of the hundreds they laid off. That's the big sign things have turned. Get in before that news."
"Folks, this stock has been a rollercoaster. It doesn’t take much to knock it. The article on the 787 was the latest excuse to beat up on it. I am not minimizing this issue (although it is much less significant for SPR than BA notwithstanding SPR getting hit much harder than BA yesterday). I would like it to get resolved sooner rather than later. But it seems more likely than not that we are in the later innings of this issue and there are other positives that longs are well aware of. If your timeframe is more than a few days or weeks and especially if it is potentially multiyear, then the stock would seem to be attractive at these levels. Try not to get the daily nonsense frustrate you too much (yes, easier said than done at times, I know)."
"If you believe that they won’t come up with a deal with a creditor(bank), sell it. If you do believe they will come up with a deal, buy it. Simple as that. Personally, I think they will make a deal."
In another couple of months the 52 week low will be in the $30s instead of $17. Coupled with another positive quarterly report we should see lots of action. Add to that some big news and it's fuel to its . 
"China announced successful max 737 test flight. as I said before, Boeing posts its China market prediction followed by freeing Huawei CFO. China certification of MAX is imminent."
Just bought 2K shares @19.07 guys!
I’m out. Only made $60 cost averaging. I’ll wait to see what tomorrow brings.
I've got a buy in at $40.87. I really hope it doesn't get there but I have no idea what's going on anymore.

air filtration/disinfecting systems on planes will make this stock soar to new highs
Lightly traded --- very volatile --- Relax !
SPR should have a great QR as well next week as they build components for the 787 and 737MAX. I'm very optimistic about this and hope this will be a real turnaround for both BA & SPR. 
Zacks says sell. and It's already the second year as sell... Meanwhile spr is up over 100%. What should happen for zacks to rethink?
"Finally! No more masks! That means we're back to pre pandemic. Combine that with the freedom to fly to the max 737 and we should see a return to Old highs of $102 per share! I guess it takes a while for the good news to reach through to the heads of the airlines to order more Max's. But I anticipate it should be coming shortly. With the streamlining of the company and the addition of more companies under its wing, it's not only $102 this year but higher! But first things first. Start with the ordering of more Max's and filling up flights to capacity providing the airlines money to order more."
"Started a position today. Big one too. Market fell in love with tech, even though pandemic is nearing an end. Recovery stocks will outperform when there’s a turn, just a matter of waiting for it."

Much already factored in current SP. 3.4 billion debt and 1.9 billion cash in bank. SPR will be fine. Adding today on any down price.
I guarantee Cathie Wood is adding today.
Spirit bringing back 900 employees to work today...a good sign that orders may be picking up again. Has Boeing been given the heads-up that 737MAX will be airborne again before the end of the year?
"this is the best recovery play out there. i would say crude but its 36 and wont recover till next year. Cruise and cinema will wait till next may. sooo, after elections , corona will fade off and with the stimulus , we ll be 36usd less then 10days like June 9th. you can easyly cash out x2 in a month if you dont believe in... but for the longs, 1 year period wii be 50usd or more. so good luck waiting for below 17usd lol those days are long gone pal"
"Thinking of taking a position here, would love to hear from some long’s, if you think this is a good investment and entry point?"
If you are waiting on the actual certification announcement then it will be too late. I expect multiple leaks before the official announcement. If you are like me (small investor) we will be left behind if we try to time this to the announcement. Accumulate now and wait for the next couple of months to see at least a 50% return.
looks like we might finish about $44 today.
"Anyone keeping up on Hyperloop?Open source, many countries looking for initial installations, ecofriendly replacement of short haul airplanes. Such as LA to Las Vegas, NY to Atlantic City, Dallas to Chicago? You know there is  in the infrastructure bill. We just don’t know how deep. I read they are comparing it to the freeway system. So that would mean a new way to cross the country without roads or airplanes. Hyperloop: https://virginhyperloop.com/experienceAs soon as a project begins, there will be money pouring in. I believe SPR will be building pods, and tube sections. Highly lucrative!Probably why the MM’s have been holding this open down. They want it all.

it looks like we may be heading back to that January dip. I hope not but if so I will load up like crazy.
"this is last week of low. from Monday will going up.. cos of this partnership of hyperloop. so buy this week. Virgin Hyperloop and Spirit AeroSystems Announce Collaboration AgreementLOS ANGELES and WICHITA, Kan., June 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spirit AeroSystems [NYSE: SPR] has joined in partnership with Virgin Hyperloop as it prepares to move towards a commercial product. The collaboration will help to solidify the hyperloop prototype utilizing Spirit AeroSystems engineers, fabricators, builders, supply chain and certification experts, and technicians.“As one of the most credible aerospace-grade structures companies in the world, Spirit AeroSystems provides a strong fit for our team as we look to build out strong partners in the hyperloop ecosystem,” said Josh Giegel, Chief Technology Officer of Virgin Hyperloop.Hyperloop is a new mode of transportation designed to eliminate the barriers of distance and time for both people and freight. It can travel at speeds approaching 700mph, connecting cities like metro stops -- and it has zero direct emissions. With hyperloop, vehicles, called pods, accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The pod floats along the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag. The hyperloop supply chain is unique in the way it integrates existing technology with proprietary innovations to deliver a completely new transport experience. The pod is similar to an airplane fuselage in a low pressure environment, the columns similar to those of a pipeline, and the pressure management system similar to those used in industrial operations such as manufacturing semiconductors. “As a new form of mass transportation, hyperloop opens up a new segment of diversification for us in the transportation space. Our collaboration with Virgin Hyperloop is a prime example of our belief that this burgeoning industry is a game changer,” said Keith Hamilton, Spirit Executive Director of Programs & Business Development. “Through leveraging our values and core competencies of designing and manufacturing aerostructures, many of the skills are transferable to produce the hyperloop bogie.”This new transit mode will unlock exponential growth opportunities for cross-industry manufacturing and development jobs - across construction, aerospace, rail, automotive, aviation, electric vehicles, and autonomous control. As Virgin Hyperloop looks to create the first Hyperloop Certification Center in the United States, it will bring thousands of jobs for first movers of the technology and its partners."
I will follow Cathie Wood.
"American people have short memory. Look at long term chart of any airlines and you wont even see 9/11 effect. Covid solution will be found, life will be normal, SPR will learn from this pandemic, become more efficient, diversity revenue stream other than BA. Long term buy !"
Is SPR a buy???
"I see this stock at $50 in the near term. But, near term means end of COVID, or end of COVID on the horizon. Lots of traders here talk of 80, 90 and 100. I believe that too, but not for 3 years. This is a great company, always has been. they are a powerhouse in manufacturing."
let's have another great and steady climb back into the $40's today. Great company with a bright future!. Let's go SPR!
"Starting to look like a reasonable entry point. With air travel slowly bu surely restarting this should bounce back to 50ish area before next earnings report. Looking to enter today if we see a strong move up or tomorrow if it continues to dangle around 41,5..."
"This should be 80-100 in short term. Depending on hyperloop and Morocco projects go, could be much higher"
Never ever thought SPR would be trading this low again. What a gift.
$50 by EOW! Who else thinks this happens now that the Senate passed 1.9t bill? Long SPR.....!
This Dreamliner news is temporary. Three more weeks. Quarterly report. 52 week low in the 30s. That alone should bounce price to 60s plus. Add to that China lifting Max restrictions and placing YUGE order? Fughettaboutit! 
Singapore permitted 737 max back in the air.
This will not stay down here for long. Neither will BA.
Bought in July 2020..this is the best performing stock in my portfolio..up almost 104%
Now that the $3.5T with a T bill is shot down the market is free to run.
Possible 135 plane order from Ryanair Over $40 this week cfo ceo are speaking in 3 hours
Something is very wrong here.
SPR should be at a higher growth clip than BA. Should catch  past $50. Expect this to be in $80’s by mid summer
"You buy when it's beat up and down. Economy will recover and airlines will fly, it is a matter of time. $circa $21 $SPR has great risk reward ratio.. accumulating from here 9n is a smart move, even if it goes down to $15. Dollar cost average will pay off. Patient 8nvedtord looking at 400% appreciation, after Covid-19 is gone."
They've been saying all along to expect the 777 certification 3rd quarter of 2023. It's a ploy to shake stocks loose for cheap pickup.Anticipating August quarterly report. 
EPS of (0.31) as compared to estimates of (0.66)!! Huge beat!
Trump's admin loves to reward contracts to BA RTX NOC LMT which will help SPR go higher!
Should I buy this for long term 2-4 years investment? Any chance of bankruptcy?
Gail kept silence for 5 days and we were up. Gail talks - we 3% down. Gail - shhh...
"SPR is my largest holding by far. I’ve been accumulating shares for a few years and bought a bunch in the teens and 20’s I’ve been able to cost average to around $43. If it falls into the $30’s, I’ll buy more. Spirit is becoming more diversified and is expanding rapidly, good long term prospects."
I still think this has a very good upside and a bargain at this price. I’ll continue buying the dips and wait for it to rise back up to the 40s In the next quarter
"Here we go. In for BA, SPR and UAL. Love technicals and fundamentals. Sit back and wait."
Revenues will rise for many years to come because the Max makes financial sense to airlines due to much lower fuel operational costs. This will be helped in the 1-2 yr timeframe also because airlines delayed purchases to replace aging fleets.
COVID is getting worse not better. Take your money and run
Added more today. Thanks
Boeing to resume building the Max. Spirit supplies the fuselage among other components. Great news. #BAhttps://news.yahoo.com/boeing-says-start-building-737-164406337.html
Hate to even say this but what else can be messed up with the Dreamliner production? Hoping nothing.
"ceo said the recent layoffs ""will help spr to remain financially healthy""......"
SPR will reach $100
I like having the support of Cathie Wood and ARK.
It's gone up too much too fast. Time to get out

"""Explaining his bullish sentiment on the company is Cai Rumohr of Cowen & Co., who wrote that regarding the eventual global recovery of the 737MAX saga, Spirit AeroSystems, as the world’s paramount aerostructures supplier, stands to gain the most.The four-star rated analyst maintained a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target from $60 to $70 on a more positive outlook. This target reflects a possible 12-month upside of 39.30% from Monday’s closing price of $50.25Rumohr explained that as long as business and travel trends continue in their current paces, SPR could be looking at three times the 737MAX sales rates for the year than what was seen in 2020. Furthermore, investors are eager to see China recertify the aircraft model, as the country represents about 25% of the backlog."""
