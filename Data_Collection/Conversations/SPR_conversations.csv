"another 7% up this week, and a great day all around for the market. I will enjoy my weekend even more. Everyone enjoy your!"
"First time buyer here with SPR. Looking at the fundamentals and recent stock price, it seems like a great buy. I’m in at $23.41 with more ammunition to use. How low do you think it could go considering their entire business relies heavily on new planes being built? I saw the pop that BA gave it when they said they’re restarting 737 max production but it gave up all of those gains then some.Honest opinions are appreciated!"
"SPR and BA trade in inverse to AAPL. Today AAPL is up and surprise, surprise SPR is down."
"Today’s action looked like it was wrapped around options expiration. I was watching level II and realized the call board doesn’t even keep up with the real numbers... MMs made some serious coin on the side today, it’s also a quick way for them to seize control of shares. I didn’t realize how they can play the fiddle when they want to... study... The stock price is certainly being held down, in favor of parting shares from loose fingers. SPR will POP, Pop, & pop!"
"Last night, after market, 400 shares were traded at $42.50. Just like the last time an after market trade brought it down to $43.50. What's going on? Who's doing this? Is it a signal between hedge funds what to do the next day? It doesn't take me off of this stock at all. I know what I know about the stock and I'm sticking with it no matter what. I'm looking at the big picture. Patience is an acquired taste. Or one forced upon you by circumstance."
I think SPR BA NTLA UBER LFYFT are trading at the bargain price!
When 50 ????????????
airlines stocks (UAL DAL LUV ALK) & BA look ok today meaning SPR will rise from here.
SPR needs to detach from BA as it is more than BA business.
My first initial purchase was around 21 in April/may and bought on dips as low as 17 and change over last few months... NO REGERTS < that’s intentional 
"The Boeing 737 MAX may soon be in the air again. The European aviation authority EASA is about to give the aircraft a green light, EASA director Patrick Ky told Bloomberg news agency on Friday. With the approval, aircraft maker Boeing is taking a step towards its goal of getting the 737 MAX back on the air before the end of this year.EASA makes the decision after a number of test flights in September. ""Our analysis is that the aircraft is safe and the safety level is high enough for us,"" Ky told Bloomberg. According to the director, the safety level can be further improved, but that is not a requirement to be allowed to air again.The European aviation authority is the first to give the green light for the popular aircraft. The American aviation authority FAA has not yet approved the aircraft. The FAA made a test flight with the aircraft at the end of last month.Ky expects the necessary paperwork to be sent out next month. This is followed by a further period of four weeks during which other parties may respond to the green light from the aviation authority.In March last year, the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after two aircraft of this type crashed in rapid succession in Indonesia and Ethiopia. A total of 346 occupants were killed.Source:https://www.nu.nl/economie/6084358/europese-luchtvaartautoriteit-boeing-737-max-veilig-genoeg-om-mee-te-vliegen.html(translated from Dutch)"
"WHAT A FORTUNE TELLER . GOT 25 CENTS WORTH !!!fidelity account--Goldman Sachs Adjusts Price Target on Spirit Aerosystems Holdings to $69 From $65, Maintains Buy Rating"
"WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said it was offering $482.3 million in aviation manufacturing assistance to 313 businesses, including up to $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (SPR)."
"""Explaining his bullish sentiment on the company is Cai Rumohr of Cowen & Co., who wrote that regarding the eventual global recovery of the 737MAX saga, Spirit AeroSystems, as the world’s paramount aerostructures supplier, stands to gain the most.The four-star rated analyst maintained a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target from $60 to $70 on a more positive outlook. This target reflects a possible 12-month upside of 39.30% from Monday’s closing price of $50.25Rumohr explained that as long as business and travel trends continue in their current paces, SPR could be looking at three times the 737MAX sales rates for the year than what was seen in 2020. Furthermore, investors are eager to see China recertify the aircraft model, as the country represents about 25% of the backlog."""
Never sees $37 again and sees $50 by Nov.
"This week two positive pieces of news. China orders planes from Boeing strictly for commercial use. Then Southwest orders up to 500 more Max for route expansion. One more and we have a 3 stage rocket to break through the stratosphere. Maybe China announces approval of Max for travel? If so, we could have a nice frenzy going on Tuesday. Remember when Kodak went up 1500%? I'm not greedy. Will be very happy with a 200-300% bump from here."
"New numbers of fuselages for 737MAX coming soon. After the lashing from the plandemic, and Boeing last year. This year will be blazing... before the end of the year, will we have more Hyperloop news, or CFRP panels to an existing model? Any pontificator?I feel SPR will far outpace the market."

If you have traveled at all recently you would know just how fked up this low price here is.
Gail kept silence for 5 days and we were up. Gail talks - we 3% down. Gail - shhh...
Exactly the same walkdown as last 2 qtrs.
"I don't see it going much lower. The drop to $43 on the 25th was a major fluke. It rebounded really quick. That says there is value at $43. It is going to rise with Boeing orders over the next few quarters. The 737 has been signed off for flight months ago, the 787 is going to come back, the 800+ cancelled planes are going to be reordered at better prices for each of the airlines, SPR has better government contracts for bombers, other countries are adding order to SPR build. I see it at $70+ by December. A big jump in price is when SPR puts out a statement towards the summer (my guess) that they are rehiring a portion of the hundreds they laid off. That's the big sign things have turned. Get in before that news."
EPS of (0.31) as compared to estimates of (0.66)!! Huge beat!
"When BA crosses $220, SPR will be $45+....BA earnings on 10/27 and expected to be BIG + good guidance + China's deal (1,000 737 MAX)"
In another couple of months the 52 week low will be in the $30s instead of $17. Coupled with another positive quarterly report we should see lots of action. Add to that some big news and it's fuel to its . 
"what's everyone's short, mid, and long-term outlook on SPR? I don't think the airlines industry is as bearish in the short-term as the news outlets make it seem. Travel should come back quick in my opinion."
"WICHITA, Kan., April 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) today announced its board of directors declared a regular quarterly $0.01 per share cash dividend on its outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable July 6, 2021, to stockholders of record as of the close of business June 14, 2021."
Its definitely a perfect storm of negatives. The irony is that this company is doing well considering. It's the other viables and variants causing the market to bleed. Keep holding.
"Starting to look like a reasonable entry point. With air travel slowly bu surely restarting this should bounce back to 50ish area before next earnings report. Looking to enter today if we see a strong move up or tomorrow if it continues to dangle around 41,5..."
"The Spirit AeroSystems Analyst: Kristine Liwag upgraded the rating for Spirit AeroSystems Holdings from Underweight to Overweight, while raising the price target from $18 to $50."
you go right ahead and sell here and I will buy them. We can check back in a year and see who was right.
now. Is this what it feels like to make it. Feels nice knowing we’ve already won just have to hold. $SPR
$SPR $VENA It's evident in the daily chart. Not in yet but will be ready
"Good news these days. China market is a big one for Boeing & SPR. Also within a couple of months Air France/KLM will anounce their large order. Boeing has a good history with KLM, hopefully lots of 737MAX orders."
"No matter how good a company is, unless investors know about it the price will stagnate and decline. SPR needs a new PR head.Second time posting this. Will try and try again until it posts. So forgive potential duplicates."
"Airlines need airplanes no matter what… it’s a cycle, they need new airplanes every 25 to 30 years. Even if travel demand is down they need new airplanes anyway. There’s a pilot shortage for a reason… more people are traveling today than 10 years ago. The demand for air cargo is also increasing thanks to e-commerce. Without mentioning defense which is another big part of the business. I invested on SPR and BA because of this but unfortunately some investors don’t do their dd and end up selling on great and sustainable companies like these two. Once they realize they made a mistake they will come back and put their money in. At some point long term investors will be rewarded. Patience is key!"
The creditability of the U.S. here and abroad is taking a down turn and will affect the market negatively as well.
I think hedge funds have tweaked their algorithms to achieve maximum annoyance for Gail and they just have daily meetings going over the comments
hopefully buy end of the year we should see more contracts coming to Boeing no that the 737 Max has been approved for return to the air. Just need the new software/firmware to be updated in all jets along with some new training for pilots. Good news still
"""After 14 months of turmoil that included the 737 Max grounding and the coronavirus pandemic, Boeing had more orders than cancellations in February."" Great news for Spirit"
"I think we found support today, recovery stocks will heavily outperform next year"
"Makes no sense to sell even with the huge rally off the lows. It is still way off the highs. It'll take years to get to all time highs, but no reason for it not to be able to get to mid 30s in the next few days"
"You buy when it's beat up and down. Economy will recover and airlines will fly, it is a matter of time. $circa $21 $SPR has great risk reward ratio.. accumulating from here 9n is a smart move, even if it goes down to $15. Dollar cost average will pay off. Patient 8nvedtord looking at 400% appreciation, after Covid-19 is gone."
Up to 100$ by end of Q2/2022 if BA get thier act together
turning into #$%$ ???
Spirit AeroSystems is down 5.36% to 38.12
Only lower 1 time since last December and in the midst of a recovery? I am adding here.
This was my only stock with a positive return for the day.
"SPR pulled back further than I thought it would but as soon as this Delta BS is over, it will recover sans any black swan event. I'm not buying more but I'm not selling either."
"2 days until EC and more good news! ""EDGEWOOD, N.Y., May 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI Aero”) (NYSE American: CVU) today announced that it was awarded a follow-on order for nearly $1 million from Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR) to manufacture cabin rack assemblies for new production CH-53K King Stallion Helicopters, built by Sikorsky Aircraft. Deliveries are scheduled for 2022. Including this new order, total orders from Spirit AeroSystems for CH-53K assemblies now total approximately $3.6 million.CPI Aero president and CEO Douglas McCrosson stated, “CPI is proud to be the single source supplier of these assemblies for the CH-53K King Stallion. The USMC is looking to complete Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) and declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the CH-53K later this year and we look forward to supporting higher production rates as the program moves through Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and into Full-Rate Production (FRP).”"
They had some interesting insights about SPR on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Why the sell off on no news today? The PPS should be a lot higher
Tomorrow I add significantly here. BA guidance will be far better than this price supports.
"ceo said the recent layoffs ""will help spr to remain financially healthy""......"
"not bad ER for Boeing ... narrower loss than expected, increased liquidity, ditched Embraer deal to focus on core backlog ... translates well for SPR"
"More demand means more business for SPR.""(Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Tuesday it delivered 29 aircraft in March, up from 20 a year earlier, with the U.S. planemaker's net orders staying positive for the second straight month as airlines get ready for a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.The company's orders appear to be turning a corner after the coronavirus crisis caused airline customers to cancel hundreds of jets on orders last year, resulting in one of the worst performances for Boeing ever.Boeing's net orders turned positive for the first time in 14 months in February as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts boosted the confidence of its customers. The plane manufacturer said it booked March gross orders of 196 aircraft, all of them for its 737 family of jets. Net of cancellations and conversions, Boeing had 40 jet orders for its 737 planes last month.Boeing said its March gross orders include previously announced 100 737 MAX orders for Southwest and 24 737 MAX orders for private investment firm 777 Partners and 11 orders for P8 military aircraft.Turkish Airlines canceled 10 737 MAX airplane orders in March and converted 40 737 MAX jet orders to options.China's CDB Financial scrapped 16 737 MAX orders last month and China Aircraft Leasing canceled 26 737 MAX orders.Alaska Air and United Airlines respectively recontracted nine and 25 737 MAX orders last month for earlier delivery positions.Nineteen 737 MAX orders were canceled by unidentified customers in March.Boeing's gross orders for the first quarter were 282 airplanes. Net of cancellations and conversions, orders stood at 69 aircraft in the quarter. Adjusted for stricter accounting standards, Boeing's net orders were 76 airplanes in the first quarter ended March.Boeing's official backlog rose to 4054 aircraft orders in March from 4041 orders in February.The company delivered a total of 77 airplanes in the first quarter, up from 50 aircraft a year earlier. Boeing resumed 787 jet deliveries in late March after halting them for four months due to production defects."""
"Three weeks ago, I thought the bottom would be $18 in worst case. With the lack of Stimulus, $16 may be the new bottom...I am basing that on no stimulus, no vaccine and layoffs in Airline industry...A long term investor could really profit with a buy here...looking at 2016-2018 as reference points, this company was doing the right things before 737 Max and the virus...It will rise from the ashes"
Hate to even say this but what else can be messed up with the Dreamliner production? Hoping nothing.
"I'm still a buyer at $43. This is a gift. Some delays and repairs, but nothing awful happened. This will rebound soon."
funny chart. nothing natural
"Having just returned from the EU after a 2 week vacation I can say that airports are full, travel is robust, and the BA 737 as well as the Dreamliner I flew on are the best and most efficient aircraft I flew on. If you want to sell to hedge funds at the bottom be my guest."
They've been saying all along to expect the 777 certification 3rd quarter of 2023. It's a ploy to shake stocks loose for cheap pickup.Anticipating August quarterly report. 
The Afghanistan withdraw debacle impacted the investment sentiment negatively. Not a political talk. Just saying.
Not so easy attacking travel as oversold as it all is here. If Trump were in office SPR would be over $65.
"Nice article in Forbes opining that Spirit has enough cash to survive their forecasted worst-case scenario: ""We find that in the worst case, it will consume more than $300 million in cash. Quite a bit of burn but fortunately, it has a sufficient cash cushion to take the hit...In the second scenario, where revenue declines by 50%, the company could post losses of $-626 million and its free cash flow could drop to $-233 million. This is quite likely as Spirit saw its revenue drop nearly 45% in the quarter ending April 2, 2020. Not a very rosy scenario but not too bad either, considering the drop in revenue and current market conditions. In addition, the company had nearly $2.35 billion of cash at the beginning of the year. At the end of March, this cash pile reduced to $1.83 billion but still quite comfortable given the expected cash outflow this year. Overall, we believe the company can safely navigate the current crisis which might aid its stock recovery as demand starts to rebound.""Google ""With Boeing Pessimistic, Should Spirit Aerosystems’ Investors Stay In High Spirits?"" to find the article."
SPR and BA upgraded to outperform by Bernstein 
"Hyperloop, Boeing, and AirBus are customers. Plus they have qualified carbon fiber panels, able to reduce an airplanes weight 5%. What’s not to like. This company will be better than before. I see a ceiling-of-resistance within 2-years at $120. Then as revenue begins to make it all better... breakout to the upside. Value stands the test of time..."
anyone understand why this is dropping with news if Maxx being recert to fly would think it would be soaring.
"""FAA demands emergency inspection of all Boeing 777s after mid-air explosion ripped engine into pieces"" I wonder how this will affect Spirit. I guess I am wondering what, if am it will have on the stock price. I know it will depend on the findings. My initial gut feeling is there will be a small pullback in BA, which usually transfers over to SPR. I know that Spirit manufacturers the fuselage, nacelles, and struts for the 777, and the engines are made by GE. Just wondering what others thoughts are on it?"
Once this recovers I will never look at it again. So volatile even down here. At his level it should never drop even a dime.
Lightly traded --- very volatile --- Relax !
Close BA down for 90 days and see how the world does without them. They will pay $600 a share to get them opened again.
"Finally! No more masks! That means we're back to pre pandemic. Combine that with the freedom to fly to the max 737 and we should see a return to Old highs of $102 per share! I guess it takes a while for the good news to reach through to the heads of the airlines to order more Max's. But I anticipate it should be coming shortly. With the streamlining of the company and the addition of more companies under its wing, it's not only $102 this year but higher! But first things first. Start with the ordering of more Max's and filling up flights to capacity providing the airlines money to order more."
"I see this stock at $50 in the near term. But, near term means end of COVID, or end of COVID on the horizon. Lots of traders here talk of 80, 90 and 100. I believe that too, but not for 3 years. This is a great company, always has been. they are a powerhouse in manufacturing."
China will either buy from BA soon or be left behind. They can ill afford to let that happen.

Singapore permitted 737 max back in the air.
"Any airline looking to retire older, fuel inefficient airframes will be putting in huge orders for the MAX and others even if they are a number of years ahead of pre pandemic plans...why...HISTORICALLY LOW...GENERATIONALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. They know the post pandemic recovery will drive massive revenue in the coming years and money WILL NEVER BE THIS CHEAP AGAIN"
Southwest is reportedly in talks with Boeing and GE for a potentially huge 737 Max order as the carrier looks to refresh its fleet.
+8% for the week. That's how I like to start the weekend! 
"low volume, low market cap, time to add shares."
let's have another great and steady climb back into the $40's today. Great company with a bright future!. Let's go SPR!
Not sure how this ever got below this price in the first place but glad it do so I could add shares.
"Be sure to tie-up your shares with high limit orders, $60, $90, $120...The percentage of float shorted is growing past 6%...It’s said over 10% becomes a good squeeze candidate.For those that don’t know. Placing a sell limit order takes your shares out of the float-loan pool..."

This Dreamliner news is temporary. Three more weeks. Quarterly report. 52 week low in the 30s. That alone should bounce price to 60s plus. Add to that China lifting Max restrictions and placing YUGE order? Fughettaboutit! 
"Same option game, new week."
"SPR is my largest holding by far. I’ve been accumulating shares for a few years and bought a bunch in the teens and 20’s I’ve been able to cost average to around $43. If it falls into the $30’s, I’ll buy more. Spirit is becoming more diversified and is expanding rapidly, good long term prospects."
India reinstates the 737 Max. Buy this and every dip from here.
Never ever thought SPR would be trading this low again. What a gift.
this stock went from 90 to 20 in 6 months on concern that boeing would even survive.....now that it's clear that boeing will be fine it should gradually come back as business comes back

Looks like hedge fund Elliot took a large position in SPR. Gotta admit the price drop from 90 looks attractive now. Undervalued and essential to Boeing and Airbus.
This drop today is is about a overspending Congress not the value of SPR.
SPR should have a great QR as well next week as they build components for the 787 and 737MAX. I'm very optimistic about this and hope this will be a real turnaround for both BA & SPR. 
"lots of buyers, no real sellers left."
I think if u are long time investors you should not be worried about the stock it will go up as soon international travel restrictions end then you will see more investors go back in the game
SPR BA UAL DAL ALK LUV are all up????
Look at the chart pre Max ordeal... this company is in a better shape now than ever before. Incredible potential both from financial strength to new growth targets. My #1 position and will be holding strong for years to come.
I’m out. Only made $60 cost averaging. I’ll wait to see what tomorrow brings.
"I was looking at Airbus for comparison and see that they are having supply chain issues and may not make their deliveries, lots of the parts may be the same as Boeing, we will most likely see the same issue here. I can see Spirit facing the same supply shortages, unfortunately this supply chain issue is not improving fast enough and may affect the bottom line. Let's hope for the best and prepare for the worst."
Go go go spr .. Almost two years now aviation industry struck in pandemic. Needs overall all planes  only SPR help to out.
I guarantee Cathie Wood is adding today.
Trapped here a while... opportunities lost make money elsewhere.
I was sure that I would not get Put shares on my $37 Sept 17 options...I might have to close it early as I don't want to get put shares of SPR now.
"BREAKING - Bloomberg United Airlines Holdings Inc. is in advanced talks for a large narrow-body aircraft order that would include at least 100 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets as part of a broader fleet revamp, according to people close to the matter.The Chicago-based airline sees an opportunity to upgrade its fleet and is studying several new, fuel-efficient models at a time when the likes of Boeing and Airbus SE are hungry for deals and demand for leisure travel is surging in the U.S., said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are confidential."
"Beautiful chart on the upside since Oct. 28th. Over 100% since close of that day. Hoping another 100% from here until summer of 2021, maybe? Most of us longs are playing with house money right about now I presume? 60 will probably arrive quicker than I anticipated. Happy TGDay to everyone."

2022 is right around the corner and it will bring huge growth in the aircraft industry.
Just like I said 3 hours ago.
@Ha definitely a buy. Do your DD but if you look Spirit over you'll love this company. It will be difficult to catch up to last year (as will all aviation related companies) but it has trimmed the fat and started to divest into multiple areas of manufacturing. Down more than 50% as of today it has a good path a greater pps.Any news this week about relief from a Congressional bill will give this and ma y companies an instant boost!Make your own judgement.

"As long as the 737-max is flying, this will double in 2 years (maybe 1 year). Better play than BA for sure."
I like having the support of Cathie Wood and ARK.
SPR will have a long recovery but make no mistake it will recover. I bought 6800 shares at $24.78 several months back and then recently bought another 1000 shares at $47. i plan on holding until $90 to $100 range but i expect that's at least 2 years away.
just wonder where spr will be by October: same forties or at least sixties? I hold over 14 months already and not gonna sell for 12 months more. glta

They should have Gephardt convince his old friend to excuse SPR from the mandate for obvious reasons.
"This thing is not only about aviation, they are working with virgin hyperloop project as well. Hyperloop idea came from Elon not that long ago - it’s great inovation. Big upside potential here in my opinion, not mentioning coop with BA."

I still hope to see $50 by the end if the week. We are just looking at some market corrections going on right now. GLTA 
Selling Puts to make money on dips like yesterday on this quality company is taking candy from a kid.
This stock is NOT about past earnings right now. Its all about FUTURE earnings as the airlines all around the world order new planes!!!
"This is a good long term investment. I don't have many units here because I am focused now on short term/profitable plays. However, if I had plenty of money and did not want to risk it, I would definitely invest here....i think this should double in 2 to 3 years."
"China announced successful max 737 test flight. as I said before, Boeing posts its China market prediction followed by freeing Huawei CFO. China certification of MAX is imminent."
"Started a position today. Big one too. Market fell in love with tech, even though pandemic is nearing an end. Recovery stocks will outperform when there’s a turn, just a matter of waiting for it."
SPR BA UAL DAL LUV should be up today....
"Gail, any chance you could clean up some of these posts every ½ hour? I appreciate the updates about your frustration. I feel I am now aware and can do w/o them."
If you are waiting on the actual certification announcement then it will be too late. I expect multiple leaks before the official announcement. If you are like me (small investor) we will be left behind if we try to time this to the announcement. Accumulate now and wait for the next couple of months to see at least a 50% return.
"this is the best recovery play out there. i would say crude but its 36 and wont recover till next year. Cruise and cinema will wait till next may. sooo, after elections , corona will fade off and with the stimulus , we ll be 36usd less then 10days like June 9th. you can easyly cash out x2 in a month if you dont believe in... but for the longs, 1 year period wii be 50usd or more. so good luck waiting for below 17usd lol those days are long gone pal"
"By Daniel McCoy – Reporter, Wichita Business JournalJul 6, 2021, 2:23pm EDTShort sellers are abandoning the ship as Spirit swings into growth-mode."
COVID is getting worse not better. Take your money and run
SPR nicely green on a red market day.
"Who will be the first manufacturer to build and test a legacy design with Spirit’s new CFFP, fuselage panels? No panels means making a composite barrel, with panels could allow easier manufacturing, and major repair ability. The tools used for the trainer eliminated shimming. Imagine a NMA with no shims, CFFP, and CFRP wings. Boeing is researching their next moves, and they want to win... It will have CFRP wings, Japan, and Everett make those.https://www.spiritaero.com/pages/release/spirit-develops-new-carbon-fiber-fuselage-panel-to-support-lower-cost-higher-production-volumes-for-aircraft-manufacturing"
"Many of my friends work for this company. The company is struggling just like any aviation company in this environment. I see this as an opportunity to leverage down and buy more. The company first took a hit with the 737 Max deal and then covid hit a months later...prior to all of that, it was in the 80s and 90s. Will it get back to 80s and 90s in the next year, probably not, but 50s, maybe 60s...I would think so. This is a long term play, not a short play."
"Spirit AeroSystems (SPR +3.7%) ramps higher after Bank of America double-upgraded shares to Buy from Underperform with a $50 price target, which views the recent 17% drop since the end of May prompted by Boeing's problems as overdone.BofA analyst Ronald Epstein believes Spirit Aero will benefit from the recovery in narrowbody demand, leaner operations and a more diversified portfolio.Recent acquisitions and joint ventures provide Spirit Aero with a more diversified portfolio, including exposure to Airbus's A220 and A320 platforms, large commercial and business jet aftermarket, and defense, Epstein says, also noting the company's plans to repay ~$1B of debt in the next three years, ""deleveraging at a faster pace than Boeing.""It's a lower target than it should be, but its positive news so I'll take it."
"SPR, an almost monopoly, costructing major parts for BA and Airbus. it's a steal at this price."
"People worry about the direction of this country: border lost control with illegal immigrants flooding in wanting freebies, inflation sky rocking, CDC declare the need for booster shots and masking again, congress corruptions, endless spending to buy votes, homelessness....and now the Afghanistan debacle. I know, this is a stock forum, but all that I mentioned will impact the market negatively big time."
"Folks, this stock has been a rollercoaster. It doesn’t take much to knock it. The article on the 787 was the latest excuse to beat up on it. I am not minimizing this issue (although it is much less significant for SPR than BA notwithstanding SPR getting hit much harder than BA yesterday). I would like it to get resolved sooner rather than later. But it seems more likely than not that we are in the later innings of this issue and there are other positives that longs are well aware of. If your timeframe is more than a few days or weeks and especially if it is potentially multiyear, then the stock would seem to be attractive at these levels. Try not to get the daily nonsense frustrate you too much (yes, easier said than done at times, I know)."
"Does SPR have enough money to avoid bankruptcy as the demand for planes is going to be very low over the next 18 months? I ask this because another supplier wen into bankruptcy. Where are most of their planes manufactured in the states, are they in north Carolina ? Thanks, dave"
Zacks says sell. and It's already the second year as sell... Meanwhile spr is up over 100%. What should happen for zacks to rethink?
We were higher than this in February. They have held this down here basically over 6 months even in the face of a travel recovery. Time for this to get back close to $50.
Revenues will rise for many years to come because the Max makes financial sense to airlines due to much lower fuel operational costs. This will be helped in the 1-2 yr timeframe also because airlines delayed purchases to replace aging fleets.
Should I buy this for long term 2-4 years investment? Any chance of bankruptcy?
