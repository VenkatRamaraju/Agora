This is a great buy. Beautiful dividend
H&R Block is down 4.94% to 23.28
Lets go Brandon
HOW about its weighted alpha?Weighted Alpha is a measure of one year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.
What is a good entry point for this one?
"HRB is a strong buy with a $25 target. The company normally does 3.1 billion a year and makes about $2.50 in earnings. The stock would normally trade about 10x or $25. Last year, the tax deadline got pushed so, $450 mln of the tax returns got pushed into this years numbers. As, a result last year they reported $2.65 bln and $.84 in EPS. This year they will report 30% top-line growth at $3.1 and 300% bottom line growing to $3.33 in EPS. The following year, they should be back on track for $3.2 billion and about $2.50 in EPS. I believe this year tax returns will be more complicated with people getting unemployment and not withholding and PPP loans. Thus more people could visit their offices, which they get $260 for a average tax return versus their $30 software version. In the meantime, the company should throw off $1 bln in EBITDA and will buy back $600 mln in stock versus a $3.1 billion market cap. So, the stock is trading like 6x eps, versus normal 10x and you get a 6.6% yield. They have been increasing the dividend $.04 a year so the yield will increase to 6.75% in July. The Bottom line is, the stock is basically at the downside, and could go to $20-30."
What a beautiful buy at $24.50 yesterday
"They are an ATM. Steady, stable business, with improving trends for tax assistance with more complex tax code and more stimulus. They print cash flow and return it to shareholders. Incredibly low P/E stock for what you get, plus upside on the financial services, small business, and WAVE. The market doesn't value this stock appropriately for the FCF it kicks off. Surprised it hasn't gotten taken private through an acquisition or acquired by a Financial company to access the refund dollars of clients onto their platform, think Paypal/Venmo."
why the dip today?
What really matters is the Pre tax loss improved $24 Million over last year when there was no Covid. Not sure why the stock is down on that news. This is always a loss quarter. They also retired 5% of the outstanding shares. That is the big news.
"I just came across this one. I'm scratching my head overall due to the price and the way it died after co-vid.I think everyone is looking for fast cash this year, I don't think this is the immediate draw for that, but this is under priced right now.Still delivers a 7% Dividend and profits won't get hit that much this year, everyone needs taxes, company keeps buying back stock each year and I can't see this going lower, than the year low and will probably return at least.Keeping my eye on an entracne on between earnings and the next dividend payout."
goes down to $24
Will buy at or below $24.00
Are earnings today 8/30?
"4% shares repurchases, 4.7% yield and 4% growth (mid Range) is a total return of 13%. Find that someplace else at 7x earnings"
What a beautiful stock
Yes.. this stock should go back to $20. It is a solid income generator. The revenue is spread and this tax season closes July15th so should see a good revenue beat their too. The same people that have used HRB in past are still using it and it is just spread out. Coronavirus does not effect taxes.. you still have to file. It is relatively safe to go to HRB and file too as it is a one on one setting or you just drop paperwork off. Taxes could be a bit more complex now too. I see NO reason why revenue would go down. Anyone??
"Check history and last 12 months. Most of the companies stock prices go down after reporting higher earnings initially , but in few days it will start climbing to new highs -every month. Not sure why, but do not sell if earnings are improving and dividends are better than banks or bonds."
