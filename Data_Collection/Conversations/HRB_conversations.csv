Barrons: H&R Block Wants to Do More Than Your Taxes. Why Its Stock Is a Buy.
"Wow, thanks for the discount!"
Short cover tomorrow hopefully Earnings good HRB business struggles for years due to use of tax software HRB not a growth stock and earnings are weakening over time
"They are an ATM. Steady, stable business, with improving trends for tax assistance with more complex tax code and more stimulus. They print cash flow and return it to shareholders. Incredibly low P/E stock for what you get, plus upside on the financial services, small business, and WAVE. The market doesn't value this stock appropriately for the FCF it kicks off. Surprised it hasn't gotten taken private through an acquisition or acquired by a Financial company to access the refund dollars of clients onto their platform, think Paypal/Venmo."
This is a great buy. Beautiful dividend
"If we get a Green Day Tom she’s gonna fly! To the moon Alice, I mean HRB!"
"Maybe I'm wrong,but I think the stock is down because people are trying to figure out what their quarter would have looked like if the tax deadline had remained at April 15 and their revenue didn't get pushed in this the next quarter. It is very difficult to compare apples to apples this year and I think that is what is causing the slump. Just my opinion."
"as trade issue escalates between countries; in US, best option to invest on local businesses. besides unnecessary drop after earning, HRB could be one of the best choices; not to mention their 3.63% dividend."
"On call, it was stated that HRB going to make significant investments and also going to more aggressively price products for growth."
"I've bought and sold HRB over and over. I read the Forbes article but believe the stock is easily worth $37 share. look where it was 3 years ago. they've bought a ton of their stock back, have plenty of cash, are diversified, we'll managed, etc. economy is better."
Lets keep it simple. Covid or not u still have to pay taxes. HRB has the brand equity to win in all segments of the market.
This stock made me forget what the green color looks like!!
HRB hit 26 weeks HI today. Great stock to own with 7% dividend.
"HRB selling off here in the AH session. Just a preview of a bigger sell-off that I expect tomorrow during the regular session, on a combination of profit-taking, valuation concerns, uncertainty as to the future. This could easily trade under $24.00 tomorrow. I think the dividend raise is actually a net negative in the short-term, as many companies raise their dividend as a way to try to prop up their stock price."
Fund managers should see we have a good year ahead. We will have a very short tax year so will be another quick income year. Everyone has to file taxes no matter what. Not sure why this is lagging in the 14's. I firmly believe this is a $20+ stock.
Good Luck all!
Close above $24 today....$25's this week.
Yes.. this stock should go back to $20. It is a solid income generator. The revenue is spread and this tax season closes July15th so should see a good revenue beat their too. The same people that have used HRB in past are still using it and it is just spread out. Coronavirus does not effect taxes.. you still have to file. It is relatively safe to go to HRB and file too as it is a one on one setting or you just drop paperwork off. Taxes could be a bit more complex now too. I see NO reason why revenue would go down. Anyone??
Guys; think about it this way. Which company will pay you $1.04 dividend per share at $19 price a share?And add to this the potential of HRB getting acquired; so you would get more upside on your initial capital investment if this happens.
What is happening to this stock. I keep buying and it keeps going down 
Whats driving the dip. I dont see any news.
"Insider buying HRB on September 3-2020 reported September 8-2020.President and CEO Jeffrey Jones direct bought 13,150shares average price: $ 15.04, total shares hold: 338,152 sharesDirector Gerard, Robert A. direct bought 12,000 shares average price:$ 15.17, total shares hold: 21,000 shares. HRB will go ex-dividend: Sep 10-2020."
The futures are all high Green...$2 jump up likely today....$26's....then $28.
"The upcoming dividend is being paid out July 1st, but what is the ex dividend date? I can't find it. Anyone know?"
Higher and higher daily...
Collected the divy and excited to buy more today at 7.1%. Even if their earnings stay the same they have enough cash to pay the divy for 20 years and after 50 years of paying don’t see that changing. Two certainties in life and one is taxes. Love this stock!
Picked up a bunch of Oct 26 Call options this week @ $1. Even a small rally in stock price will provide a 10%+ return in a week or less. Follow how I do do on this and future purchase at #allenron22 .
"To receive dividend, you must hold HRB shares by tomorrow (June 24). Its 26 Cents per share and will be paid on July 1st. July 15 is the deadline to file US taxes that was extended by 3 months. There will be lots of folks who will be filing their taxes through HR Block and Turbo. I personally used HR Block for the past 12 years and no problem e-filing with them. I see lots of revenue generated next month and its about time to load it up and see some money in your pockets."
"Anyone filling out their 1099 information on HRB ? You click 1099, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and click Add manually. It asks for a description (the financial institution) and account number. Then it allows you to click Add Sale. And it asks for a description a 2nd time on line 1. But the system only reads the info from the Description you entered in a previous screen. Then you click ""add sale"", which is what you've been trying to do. But wait. After you click add sale, it tells you about business assets or depreciation, then asks before each sale ""enter sales as a group"", then finally, after a dozen clicks, you get the Capital Gains assistant. Which in prior years you got after 1 or 2 clicks. And remember, its not reading the description you put on the capital gains assistant. Try it. And, on this 1099 form, question 12 asks if this is a collectable. Jeez um. Its for 1099 entries, stocks, bonds, mutual funds. Someone really messed this part of the entry process up."
"If you look at past 3 years of its statements, HRB has been borrowing money cheap (consequence of low interest rates) and buying back its stock. This is not a bad strategy in itself, it just one of the stategies.But now I think it has become way too leveraged for its own good. The big risk is that its cash flow needs to stay very strong.and it is likely to miss out on big opportunity when the interest rises (if it had investments in treasuries, which is what a normal bank will benefit from).and a bigger risk is what happened to other retail tax prep companies in the past. Granted HRB also has good market share in the online tax preps business.if congress ever takes aim at the earned income credit and child credits in order to boost tax revenue, HRB will be in big trouble.therefore i do not think this gap down is that surprising nor i think its a buying opportunity at this point.of course, nobody has a crystal ball and i certainly do not!just my $0.02."
Looks like hrb hit a short term bottom today. A bounce from here is likely. Maintain or add to positions as long as relative strength remains strong.
"this is still a $20+ stock all day, the trouble is, there is so much resistance at that $20 level. Once HRB properly breaks through and moves upwards of $20.75 I think this will climb very fast as all the chart and momentum traders will jump on. Good luck my price target set at $23.50 - $24.00."
What a beautiful buy at $24.50 yesterday
Just need 25 to get out of this mess.
Rocket coming soon
"This stock is so undervalued. the dividend, profitability, stability and of course; theyve bought a quarter of their stock back. im loading up with all i got"
Insider.... Jimmy “the Maltese” Grimaa just bought 22500 shares.
"So with around 25 million shares shorted (Yahoo sourced at June 14), can we hope to see a short squeeze as shorts begin to cover their positions? When would we likely see this?"
They are going from S&P 500 to mid=cap 400 Should that make any difference?
"HRB adds 2 new Officer Positions to its leadership team in August 31, 2020 press release one day aheadof September 1st 's earnings release. It is a positive news. The preliminary earnings review which was released on H&R Block Reports Tax Return Volume Through July 17; Fiscal 2021 First Quarter Results to be Released September 1st, 2020 --see Press released 4:23 pm ET July 28, 2020 (Globe Newswire)--""H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today released its preliminary results for the recent U.S. tax season that was extended due to the coronavirus pandemic. Total U.S. tax returns prepared by or through H&R Block were 21.2 million for the period of May 1, 2019 through July 17, 2020, an increase of 0.7 million, or 3.3%, when compared to May 1, 2018 through July 17, 2019. The increase in tax returns was led by DIY online filings (excluding Free File returns) of 6.7 million, resulting in growth of 10.6%. This was the fourth consecutive year of growth in the DIY business driven by continued product innovation, competitive pricing, and increased awareness.""Based on the HRB preliminary press released on July 28, 2020, I think HRB will meet or exceed the EPS to be reported after markets close September 1st, 2020."
Fiscal year ended in April and was much worse than last as filings down a lot. So May-July quarter will now be much better than last year as people rush in to file before new July 15 deadline. So in turn that means fiscal year 2021 will be great year over year. So would expect price to be back over 20 by then.
seriously what HRB has to do with trade war with any country? this stock and their service is 100% local and American.
"""H&R Block said it expects revenue will be between $3.05 and $3.1 billion in 2019, compared with analysts' estimates of $3.14 billion""Again, it shows that the analysts are clueless in their guessing games- and overpaid for their needless work.Also, the fact that the company decides to increase dividends when simultaneously reduce profitability guidance is good sign as far as I am concerned.jmo..........Thanks God I am not an analyst.............:o)"
"""Analyst Actions: Morgan Stanley Lifts Price Target for H&R Block to $17 From $16, Maintains Equal Weight RatingBY MT Newswires— 9:55 AM ET 08/03/2020"""
Just took a strong position at 13.94. Looked at the financial Statements in depth.
Why use HRB when you can do your own taxes yourself for a lot cheaper.
"Should've sold, I honestly thought this was going to go up."
"Seniors who are used to getting free tax prep have fairly cheap tax returns (VITA sites don't usually handle complex returns) and aren't interested in high-profit upsell products. They don't intend to return when the free sites open again. They will not make up for all the ""young family"" clients that have too much time at home & are playing around with tax prep software."
"If this does not see at least 2-3% upside move after earnings, I am selling out and putting money elsewhere"
"Opened a 1/4 of my position around $16.50. Of course in hindsight, I regret not going 75% in. Hoping to add more on a pullback. Maybe sub 21?Wave growth was great. Overall..and it was mentioned before...this is a boring Buffet/Value investing stock. Share buybacks, dividends..a set it a forget it type play. Boring stocks = long term wealth."
"I just came across this one. I'm scratching my head overall due to the price and the way it died after co-vid.I think everyone is looking for fast cash this year, I don't think this is the immediate draw for that, but this is under priced right now.Still delivers a 7% Dividend and profits won't get hit that much this year, everyone needs taxes, company keeps buying back stock each year and I can't see this going lower, than the year low and will probably return at least.Keeping my eye on an entracne on between earnings and the next dividend payout."
"That's 'cause it is anticipated that HRB is gonna have a season of declining revenue with all the ""free"" tax services offered. That more and more <$60K taxpayers will flock to the free sites, and those with 6-figure incomes wouldn't want to trust HRB.Bottom line: declining revenues during this, their most revenue-generating time of year"
"HR Block vs Intuit stock price performance for 2020.HR Block down 28% vs Intuit up 43% from January 1 2020 to December 31 2020. That is a huge difference between number 1 and number 2 tax software provider. In addition to being number 2 tax software provider, HR block is the number 1 tax preparation retail chain in the world. Right now in terms of the valuation, HRB's physical retail location's value is practically either given away for free or at least 75% discounted."
25.30 easy this week...divi and stock premium for Jul 20 is 7% or $1.62 ...cannot beat that
Close at $26 or higher today....It's time UP and UP.
"HRB ---It is important that the Q2-2020 beat consensus estimates during CO19 HI ( Aug 2020 thru Oct 2020). This quarter historically was always slow, and HRB managed to perform so well.H#$%$ strong cash flow, great dividend of 6%....It is a great company to own...Today's sell is kind ofover reacting...I would BUY more H&B at this depressed pricing level.....BE PATIENT!!!!!!!!! ACTUAL:$ 176.6 millionESTIMATE: $163.7 million"
Maybe Moe short selling tomorrow Sad to sayHRB gets no respectBusiness model antiquated
like your optimism otter! I'll give ya a thumbs up partner!
"Current quarter earnings are going to be a huge beat. It true the filing delays are pushing revenues farther out but that doesn't mean its lost. I have posted a few days ago why its workforce is working on the cheap. Also for example the free services many seniors use are shut down and will not provide be available this tax year. Many have no choice but to look for paid services. I am loaded with a windfall of clients from this. It may be temporary, but it sure will boost revenue in June and July. Next report will be a pleasant surprise....."
I have seen HRB move up $2's in one day in the past: $28's to $30's ....It will happen again soon when the market is very Green. Patiently waiting for the moment.
"Earnings are out:H&R Block Reports Strong Fiscal 2021 Results; Increases DividendKey Financial Metrics -- Total revenue of $3.4 billion increased by $774 million, or 29.3%, due to an increase in U.S. tax return volumes due to the extension of the 2020 tax season into our fiscal 2021, stronger mix in DIY, Emerald Card revenues related to federal stimulus payments, and strong growth from Wave. -- Total operating expenses of $2.6 billion increased by $82 million, or 3.2%, due to an increase in variable labor, partially offset by impairment charges related to the pandemic in fiscal 2020, and lower bank partner fees and travel-related costs. -- Pretax income of $669 million compared favorably to a pretax loss of $3 million in the prior year. -- Earnings per share from continuing operations increased $3.08 to $3.11; adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.84 to $3.39. --------------------------------------------------Happy to be Short a lot of shares and looking for this Bloated Baby to sell off tomorrow in response to this ER."
"Loaded up big on Friday, lets hope it pays off :)"
An up day? It's a MIRACLE!!!
2 point up will be good and very possible this week....Let's reward longs that are strong....
Upgrade in.....fwiw *H&R Block shares are trading higher after Northcoast Research upgraded the stock from Neutral to Buy and announced a price target of $20 per share.
Who thinks HR Block reports good earnings?
i think this is going to 32 per share
"I worked at several HRB offices this past tax season. All that I can figure is that there must be a lot of online returns being done and reviewed by a tax pro for a fee. Much of the time there were few or no customers in the office at all. What I saw was not because of Covid. It is what the HRB offices have been experiencing for several years now, I believe. With the simplified tax laws for individuals and people being able to do their taxes online (and in some cases for free), my prediction is that over the next 5 years, HRB will be closing about 50% of their seasonal offices and cuttinng 50% or more of their seasonal workers. Heck, last year HRB cut back and the tax pros were expected to do taxes, vaccuum the office an clean the bathrooms. I am not kidding. This is true."
At these prices I would hold for a week or at least a few days to be honest here. Retrace will happen short to mid play.
I'm imagining:Millions of Robinhood users realizing they owe short term capital gains...Crypto traders with hundreds of realized gains from EVERY crypto transactionMillions on unemployment. How many forgot to withhold taxes?People who filed for unemployment and are losing their low income housing qualifications..Short term rebate loan cash...I think it's going to be a VERY busy tax year for H&R block...
HOW about its weighted alpha?Weighted Alpha is a measure of one year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.
Anyone know what they plan to do with their 2 billion dollar loan? They clearly do not need it to pay the bills. It is free money to them as I am sure it is an insanely low interest rate. Pretty soon fed will be paying them to borrow money. No idea why we are sitting at this low a price but if you don't buy in soon you WILL miss the boat.
"Huge difference in tax rates 6%for 2018, 25% for 2019. Wasn't for the tax gift Hrb would of miss earnings estimates"
This stock has never let me down
"This looked very good in my research until I saw the drop in shareholder equity between 2020 and 2019. Also they still have a goodwill of 700 mil on the books I don't like at all. These things are really holding me back from investing, someone explain this and I might change my mind."
"HRB stock price has been performing very well in either UP or DOWN markets lately.If it breaks the $15.50 today, it will rise to $17 or even $18 in near term."
PE Ratio (TTM) 12.75EPS (TTM) 1.19Dividend: $1.04/Annual or $0.26/Quarterly per share for a 7.03% yield.
HRB is up 4.91% to 27.99
Earnings is a day or so
HRB: Value Traders' Delight....It will go back up in the $28 sooner that traders think. It will close above $24 today.
"Up over 6% so far today, this is wat happens when an undervalued company gets noticed."
"Revenue down 600 million, income down 140 million. So this is good news"
Why would you sell? I bought more. 8% dividend and NO WAY is this stock staying this low for a year. It has a rock solid dividend with solid revenue. You think people will file taxes? You file no matter what. Easiest 10%+ stock I have EVER seen. Sit on this a few years and you will double your money.
"Does anyone have insight on what happened to HRB's cash? I looked back through last quarter's earnings call transcript and didn't see any notations. As of 10/28/17, HRB cash decreased 82.1% to $181.00 million from $1.01 billion on 4/20/17."
"Earnings per share rose 176.39% year over year to $0.55, which beat the estimate of $0.50.Revenue of $601,030,000 rose by 299.72% year over year, which missed the estimate of $617,030,000. Good business and not bad numbers overall. Would have liked to hear some guidance though."
"New ""Family and Friends"" policy. If unhappy, like all of the preparers that I know, we are not happy with the new ""Family and Friends"" policy. Send Jeff Jones an e-mail, asking him to change the current policy to something that is appealing to tax advisors that work for HR Blockjjjones@hrblock.com"
"Great company, increasing FCF and with a P/E of 7.5. Seems inevitable"
"The earning is very good, I think we would see $30 soon.Remember H&R Block offered $35 buyback option couple of years back; so they are undervalued under $30."
"This stock is about to fall flat, anyone can see that. Good luck waiting for another push."
"My wife is a seasonal tax preparer for HRB and her office is overwhelmed with customers this season due to AARP limiting their free tax services due to COVID. If this follows in other locations, then earnings should skyrocket in fourth quarter."
Are earnings today 8/30?
What is a good entry point for this one?
with the dividend increase and decent report it should come back above the 200-day Moving Average which is at $26.50 IMO.
Hoping to see cost cut program announced during e call.
Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) reports 0 new Covid-19 cases for the first time since March.
What's going on today?
Everyone hold on. This is gonna be wild after close
I think there is more pain in this stock going forward.
A new 52 week high almost ever day now. This is very bullish indicator.Look for $25 next. Then $30 by year's end.
My friend works for HRB as a tax preparer. He has been working 12 hours a day including weekends since May 2020 to meet the deadline as client demands are HIGH and very busy. The HRB office opens 7 days work week during tax filings season. HRB stock price should be ok going forward. It is time to accumulate.
People will go back to the streets once they get the vaccines.This is positive for HRB since they have lots of stores.See you above $25 soon.
$25's this week on the way to $28.....Stronger HRB everyday now...
"Marched earning expectations, promises to keep paying dividends in the midst of a pandemic, has lots of cash on hand(over $2B) The share price drops by almost 7%! WallStreet is now Comedy Central"
Why would this company have a lower value than it did 5 years ago? They have very little compatition and can charge what they want. They offer the same services they have always offered. In my opinion as our population ages they will do less of their own taxes and turn to HRB. I younger generation is just not smart enough in my opinion to do their own. I see HRB in high demand and they can charge pretty much what they want and all those fees go to small overhead. People have to file taxes no matter what. What are business costs really? I do not see a downside to this stock unless I am really missing something and what could that be?
Watch the noise makers come with all the noise today. Will be buying more because this is eventually headed to $24+
I'm reading comments to ease my stress...
"HR Block made an improvement, but. Last year, I told them there was a big problem entering stock sales Capital Gains, schedule D. Last year you had to guess and click over and over, to try to find the page where you add stock sales. Its better, BUT, once you have your brokerage entered, you can't go to the ""add sale"" screen direct. You click Sale of stocks, and asks if you want to add another per. Another Broker, not an individual stock. So you click Finished, so it does not add a new Brokerage account and then it asks about Capital Loss carryover. So when you get o entering Capital loss carryover, if you click Back, it takes you to where you can add new stock sales. Come on Block, some people have hundreds, or dozens and tens of trades. They don't want to import. They just want to add new sales, that occurred in their brokerage. And you have not link sequence, other than clicking past , then clicking Back, to add new ones, or to be able to edit the existing ones. Sometimes I want to go back to turbotax."
"i work with several franchisees of hrb, they tell me they are having a great quarter"
"Buy dips, regardless of election HRB is going $20+ with a healthy dividend"
"Why is this dropping? Their fundamentals are okay, they're executing on their strategy successfully and affected by COVID-19 in a way completely out of their control but also completely recoverable."
Expect $2 point up soon; Still believe to have good news after the bell today or tomorrow morning....$25 - $26 range !!!
"Shorts dominated today. Trading was carefully controlled to not hit -10% (and trigger the short sale restriction rule), it traded just $0.02 above the threshold."
"Press released today August 31-2020, before earnings release Sept 1-2020. ""H&R Block Adds Chief Product and Experience Officer and Chief Financial Services Officer to Its Senior Leadership Team Julius Lai and Les Whiting will lead important areas of the company’s long-term growth strategy -- from GLOBENEWSWIRE 9:00 AM ET 8/31/2020 ""Sounds good!!"
What really matters is the Pre tax loss improved $24 Million over last year when there was no Covid. Not sure why the stock is down on that news. This is always a loss quarter. They also retired 5% of the outstanding shares. That is the big news.
-19% Jesus......
The company said they ended the year with 2.7 billion in cash and announced a quarterly dividend of .26 per share.
"Amazing that this POS continues to climb -- only because it sets the bar so low and then ""beats"" their number. ""The net loss for the quarter to Oct. 31 was $153.6 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with a loss of $146.2 million, or 68 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.""I guess it's OK to lose more money YOY."
can I get get dividends if I jump in today?
"HRB is a strong buy with a $25 target. The company normally does 3.1 billion a year and makes about $2.50 in earnings. The stock would normally trade about 10x or $25. Last year, the tax deadline got pushed so, $450 mln of the tax returns got pushed into this years numbers. As, a result last year they reported $2.65 bln and $.84 in EPS. This year they will report 30% top-line growth at $3.1 and 300% bottom line growing to $3.33 in EPS. The following year, they should be back on track for $3.2 billion and about $2.50 in EPS. I believe this year tax returns will be more complicated with people getting unemployment and not withholding and PPP loans. Thus more people could visit their offices, which they get $260 for a average tax return versus their $30 software version. In the meantime, the company should throw off $1 bln in EBITDA and will buy back $600 mln in stock versus a $3.1 billion market cap. So, the stock is trading like 6x eps, versus normal 10x and you get a 6.6% yield. They have been increasing the dividend $.04 a year so the yield will increase to 6.75% in July. The Bottom line is, the stock is basically at the downside, and could go to $20-30."
The next couple of days should be pretty interesting... ex-dividend date is coming up and two upgrades today from Neutral or Hold to Buy: HRB INTRADAY OPINION CHANGES Thomson Reuters/Verus upgrades H & R BLOCK INC from HOLD to BUY – 06/18/18 Ned Davis Research Group upgrades H & R BLOCK INC from NEUTRAL to BUY – 06/18/18
"This is obviously oversold... I'm a tax accountant in Texas and I can assure you that the tax reform did not simplify the tax returns for the majority of people who would typically pay H&R Block to prepare them... You have people who own businesses who are still unsure of what new deductions they qualify for, and the IRS still hasn't issued guidance on a number issues raised by the accounting industry. You also have lower income families who aren't comfortable filing their own return, that choose HR Block and are (over)charged for their returns that include earned income credits and newly increased child tax credit."
CC was positive 3-6% growth. EBITDA up in 2022. Cash generation will allow share buybacks and dividend increases. projected flat Rev which is pretty good considering the big bump this year Covid fillings. It is a strong buy
When is the effect of the buyback?
H&R Block is up 5.31% to 19.42
Gonna buy more tomorrow to bring my total to 1k. This has $50 potential with the short squeeze. That's when I'd be happy to sell.
"How sustainable is it for a business to increase the amount of customers by giving away a significant % of their product for free? Is that a solid business model, or a gimmick that will cost them in the long run?"
"The comments of the CEO lacked “confidence” they lacked vision, its as if he were reading a script prepared by someone else. I was surprised there was no mention on what would be the use of proceeds from the credit line drawdown."
"“In fiscal 2021, the company repurchased 11.6 million shares for $188 million, at an average price of $16.29.” Wow, most companies buy back shares when the prices are near highs. Good deal."
Why are they still open during the coronavirus crisis? Answer: Money. Fourth quarter earnings. They have been given a gift of having until July 15 to work. They should be closed and reopen end of April.
"HRB's stock price drop is just as irrational as cruise liners, ev stocks, and bitcoin's dramatic rise. But I am not complaining. I am buying more hrb as I speak."
"Added to my position, technically we have already broken up: https://invst.ly/tx9peIf you look at a longer term chart, we are bouncing of the historical long-term support trend line https://invst.ly/tx9rsI'm in somewhat similar industry and we are quite far from sufferings, we are actually growing. Also fed is reporting record number of small businesses opened in 2020. With the short ratio being where it is, we are very likely to see some of them covering. Earning coming out on March 4th and I wouldn't expect to see anything even remotely bad."
"July 15th is the deadline to file 2019 Tax and it has been extended to 3 months due to COVID-19 (good idea). June 25th is the Ex-Div date and I do not see pay out date in their statistics (July 1st?). Tomorrow is job reports day and just like last week, there will be reduced jobless claims and more jobs reported. The stock market is going to react positively and HRB will be around $18. Its great time to buy HRB at a discount of 8% and reap the benefits of dividend shortly. It's no brainer to buy it now."
"Considering the way the pandemic is going, what do you think are the chances that IRS will extend tax filing deadline from April 15, 2021 to July 15, 2021? What are the chances? Any guesses?I think there is a 60% chances at this time."
Your convictions and common sense. Why would this stock trade lower than its historical average? What has changed in the last three years? In my opinion very little has changed and this stock belongs in the 20's. It is guaranteed people will have to do taxes virus or not. I believe more people will use HRB because the younger generation is not bright enough and want things quick and easy and the older generation is just tired of doing it. Not sure why we are even hanging out at this price. My best guess is big guy manipulation. This stock has paid a dividend since the first day it was listed. Lots of potential for suprise positive news too. Can you explain why this stock should trade lower?
When it dropped to around 11.00 as a direct result of Covid I was too frightened to act not knowing what to expect next. It was a missed opportunity. I saw it go back to 18 and thought I missed my chance at a company I have watched and liked for a long time. At 18 it was overpriced in my opinion. At 11 it was a steal; at 13.94 I believe it is a good investment and I firmly believe the dividend paid at 13.94 is safe and yields almost 8 per cent.
"interesting, im think earnings sell was over reaction, went down with the market, beating the market today"
Result looks great. A profit of $124M compared to a loss of $207M from same quarter last year! Now I need a 6-10% move!!!
INTU PE is 46.87....I am not sure what Cramer is thinking ...next year HRB expected growth EPS 7.3% and 4 % divi yield ...I am good with that
"MGI, one of the old guards, has become a hot commodity in the age of digital money transformation because its name brand, well distributed network and customer relationships. Driven by covid19, its future is in contactless digital transfer. $HRB should do a buyout of MGI. The two combined will be a winner in the old guard transformation into fintech in this new era due to covid-19."
"H&R Block is hiring 500+ positions on their jobs site, their business is fine. No idea why the stock fell, just because management was prudent in planning for worst case scenario?"
HRB has continued to hit 13 weeks HI. It is a sign of bullish for both short term and long term trend.HRB price is heading to at least $18 this week and then heading to 52 week HI in 2020I.While collecting a 7.00% dividend rate. What a great stock to own.
"My next Pure Earnings Short Sell play is almost certainly going to be...HRB. Later today, after I Cover my current MPAA Short, I will be throwing all my hard cash into this HRB play. HRB is looking extremely good to the Short side, as a direct response to her earnings release which is coming up today after market close. Let us look at why this is my Play of the Day:1: HRB hit 2 consecutive 52 week highs, both on Friday and on Monday. Ahead of an earnings release, contrary to popular opinion, this is NOT Bullish, but rather extremely Bearish, especially when coupled with significant over-valuation, which is what we have here. Market sentiment towards the stock is at an extreme. Expectations are VERY high for this earnings release. This makes a sell-off upon release, very likely. The one contrary point here is that HRB hit their new 52 week high very early in yesterday's session, then sold off fairly hard. I certainly hope the stock rallies back up today and if she can make ANOTHER brand new 52 week high, that would make my Sell Short play even more favorable. 2: HRB is significantly over-valued right now.3: Analysts are very lukewarm towards the stock and see very little upside potential, even looking out 12 months from now. 4: A comprehensive financial analysis shows nothing impressive and plenty of strong indicators that this is just too expensive at the moment. P/E Ratio is high. Gross Margin is average. Growth Rate is below average.5: On 5/24/21, just a few weeks ago, the company Guided EPS above consensus, but Revenue below consensus, for Fiscal Year 2021. In response, the stock rightly sold off about 4.5%, but has since drifted back up to a 52 week high yesterday, for no rational reason. 6: The company has failed to meet consensus estimates on either EPS or Revenue, one of these two measures, for the past two quarters. If that happens today, I see the risk of an upside price reaction as being extremely low. For all these reasons and more, HRB looks really nice as a Pure Earnings Short Sell play and I will be doing this play later today, at any price above $25.00, but hopefully at $26+."
"Hey, most of the investors' concerns are overblown regarding the IRS extension! This is literally the best and most bullish news for HRB. The premarket price for this morning proves me right. Last year the same thing happened and some of last year's revenue and profits got pushed over to the first quarter 2021 already so even though IRS is extending deadline this time, the impact will be $2.4 EPS with extension vs. $3.5 EPS with regular April 15th deadline, which is drastically better than year 2020, which was $0.84 EPS vs $2.5 EPS without extension. This can only mean very bullish thing for year 2022 because next year EPS will be $3.5 EPS. You know Wall Street loves year over year growth and thus it is very bullish news for HRB because this literally extends and guarantees year over year growth for two tax years(2021 and 2022)over 2020! 2020 EPS $0.84, 2021 EPS $2.54 EPS, and 2022 EPS $3.55! Fantastic! Very bullish! The news could not have been better! Continued strength in HRB until August 2021 is what I will predict and it may even go higher until September."
We should have waited a bit for the dust to settle before jumping in yesterday ..........I keep on repeating that to myself......only to break my own recommendation over and over again.................
HRB clearly has demonstrated they have staying power by keeping the dividend the same. I am not sure why this keeps dropping but I will keep buying.
A reasonable goal would be 23.70 today.
"Covered my HRB Pure Earnings Short Sell play a little after Noon ET at the wonderful price of $22.92 for an outstanding single day profit of just about...$14k. This one worked out very nicely. Immediately threw all my hard cash into a brand new Pure Earnings Short Sell of KR. Looking for a similar big win tomorrow on that one, but...only time will tell whether another huge win for Shorty will occur. Good Luck Folks!"
bought some $24 call options today. 3 days rule and it's way oversold for no reason. hope for some good return before July. 
I believe the GS downgrade was unwarranted and premature. People I associate with are clueless concerning the new tax law changes and I’m certain they will most definitely be seeking professional advice (H&R block) this year when the do their taxes. I opened a position yesterday. Thanks GS for the great buying opportunity!
"HRB---For the quarter, H&R Block reported revenue of $2.33 billion, up from $1.81 billion. Consolidated earnings were $5.13 a share, up from $2.37 a share a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting revenue of $2.32 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.06 a share. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 4% to 27 cents a share. HRB sell -off today due to the whole markets sell off and waiting forFED 's 2 days hearings.... My take on HRB's EPS is great....I am a buyer of HRB today's sell-off and will collecta nice dividend of 4.25% while waiting for the stock price to come back... It is a $26 stock price and sell at a deep discount. HRB needs to close at $23.65 in order to bounce back to $24.25 near term......"
"I'm shocked that this board has such little activity. I follow very few stocks as closely as this. the stock is extremely undervalued. HE Block had an extra day of revenue. they will benefit from the processing glitch. they are financially managed extremely well. stock buyback, dividend, Trump tax overhaul complete, state tax returns getting more complex every day, internationally diversified, etc"
"The problem for H&R Block this year has been the deluge of phone calls that make it very difficult for in-office tax-preparers to get anything done. Block has tried to counter the late season start (in their usual excessively frugal manner) by hiring less Receptionists... so the phones ring off the hook & the tax people have to get them. In the beginning of the year it was: ""Where's my stimulus check! Where's my Stimulus check?"" Then... it was: ""Why is my refund taking so long! Why is my refund taking so long?"" Lately, it's been: ""You told me to come in and file early, now I read that I can get my unemployment taxes back... when can I get them back?!"""
"Not a bad quarter at all, should go up substantially and the future has got to look bright for people trying to sort out all those free trades."
sell my options contracts that expire 2/19? up over 150% on 3 contracts ? or hold or are we at the top?
Excellent positive move: Up 50 cents on 5M shares traded...High was $23.69 and closed at $23.28. We will see $24's today...It's time!
"Looks like a short squeeze coming, check out that increased volume now towards the end of the day."
"I have been using HRB Tax Software, used to be TAX CUT, for more than 10 years now and loving it. No way that I will switch to other software like Turbo Tax, etc. Note that before using HRB TAX CUT I used Turbo Tax for 2 years, but never goes back and stick with HRB software till now and in the future. I am very familiar with it. It is straightforward and very easy to use and follow. GL longs, HRB will come back up again. It will be $30's again where it belongs..."

"H&R Block Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend:""H&R Block, Inc.

At over 7% dividend, HRB is a great value stock. HRB should rise to $18 after September EPS release. I have been accumulating HRB shares."
Revenue was up 8%. The loss increased 140%. I do not see how anyone can say that is a good sign.

"Why estimate of earning is way high? Future Estimates range from 0.10 cents to $3.47. All of them bearish despite fundamentals are strong. Something is not right. Quarter 3, 2019 had estimate of -$0.59, and Q 4, 2019 estimate is $2.61 during shutdown? Agenda or manipulation?"
To the moon. Dont sell!!! Shorters in BIG TROUBLE!!!
"$GME is the leader in the bricks-and-mortar retail game sales sector, which is in long-term decline, but temporarily boosted by launching of Microsoft xbox and Sony's play station game consoles. $GME has been vastly under investing in the online gaming area because it diverted its investments into mobile phone retail and service businesses and thus wasted a lot of capital. $HRB is the leader in the brick-and-mortar income tax preparation business, which also face long-term decline and HRB is the second largest online tax preparation and tax software player behind turbotax and has been investing in this growth area for more than two decades and aggressively so in the last 5 years. Thus HRB has had and will continue to have a better future. What's more, HRB block's short ratio is 5.48 while that of $GME is at 5.78. HRB might be the next one to be squeezed because this tax season will be strong for HRB."
Sure wish someone could explain this. Solid stock that has delivered dividend for decades. Last year increased dividend with no sign of problem that I can see. What am I missing?
"anyone know how many shares traded AH? I bought at 23.90 and 23.95 in IRA account, it should be safe , willing to add if it drops down to 23.60."
No after hours action?
Hmmm... Institutional Ownership is now 97.5% up from just under 95% before earnings.

next year do UR tax on a post card ( short this for next 9 months )
We are back in share repurchase territory below $16. They have an authorization to buy back 20% of the float worth $600 million. They bought 5% in Q3. That shrinks the shares out and increases EPS. The CEO is getting traction with new products. Covid will be behind us in 6-9 months and they should return to record earnings.
Q1 will be a pleasant surprise. I could explain if anyone is interested....
"Earnings on Monday, March 9. My prediction. Earnings will be bad and completely miss estimates. "
"Oh well, I give up."
"Buy, buy, buy"
I did a complete analysis of HRB. It’s a fair buy at 14 a share. I am astounded at the current level at which it trades. Good luck everyone. HRB is a great company but as Buffett said about Kraft Hienz it does not work if you over pay for anything. I’m in at KFC at 32 which I concluded was a fair price with a 5 per cent dividend.
I wonder what is the intention of those big analysis researchers when they recommend a stock for you when they know its going to decline!
Dying company relying on buy backs and other financial manipulations to support stock price. Their storefront business is dead and they’re try to compete with Intuit and others in the cyber world. Not happening!
Huge volume in the July 25 and 26$ calls.
"The biggest assisted tax prep business and IRS data through last week shows assisted returns up 17.5% YoY while DIY is down slightly for the industry. Not only that but each week's report Assisted has grown more WoW in rate. Should be great news for HRB. An easy comparison to last year's extended season, but the improvement vs. DIY means assisted likely took share for the first time in a long time. The extra tax forms that everyone is getting for unemployment, stimulus, Gig jobs (Uber, Instacart, etc.), Robinhood trading, should be a tailwind to assisted tax business for a couple of years. Also, the tax code is just getting more complicated under the current govt. All bullish for HRB. Check out the IRS results that dropped today. Big jump in assisted returns. Should be a great year for HRB earnings.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-may-14-2021"

"# H&R Block, Inc. HRB incurred first-quarter fiscal 2020 loss per share from continuing operations of 72 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 76 cents.Loss was flat year over year as increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding offset increased tax benefit due to favorable discrete items. The company usually incurs loss in the first three quarters of fiscal year due to the seasonality of its tax business."
"I wonder how pre-season hiring will shape up. With the headaches from the child tax credit, $15 per hour in many states for other jobs without having to take classes on your own time (and dime), and Covid.........will HRB be able to staff offices?"

just stop paying taxes
Red to green.... I knew it was coming
"terrific results and dividend hiked to 27 cents from 25.stock doing nothing in AH, no surprise"
Up 10% or down 10% tomorrow?
Close $24's today....Very likely...
Can someone please explain why is this stock going ??
I got hrb @15.20 a couple months ago after the earnings. Seems like an easy ride back up to pre pandemic levels from here
Looking at $30 after earnings report.

"HRB will release its earnings on Sept 1, we will see the EPS will meet or exceed the EPS estimate consensus $0.238 and the stock price should be well above the $17 levelthat was raised by Morgan Stanley rating from $16 to $17 on Aug 3."
"Good earning with cheap price, buy 1,300 share at $24.Easy money."
It's time...$25's this week.
Why the $2 drop if earnings were so great?
I spoke with my HRB rep and she said business is booming because it is new tax law and still confusing to many. Business is up. I believe older people are sick of doing their own taxes and younger generation can't handle the math.
Buybacks or dividend increase before tax season....let's go!!!!
"Nice earnings report, won't have any issues paying out the dividend. A little short on revenue but showing growth over last year. Stock is undervalued at current prices. Will see where it goes from here."
20% of the float is shorted so lot of short covering if there is a run for this beaten down stock. Should be trading 18-20
This company has been around FOREVER and paid a dividend as long as it has been around. Very stable slow growth solid dividend. I wonder why no other company has ever bought them. A bank or some other financial company should own them. I also wonder why HRB never gets into financial planning. I frequently discuss my financial plans with my tax preparer. I think this company has a lot of untapped potential and if none of that happens I am perfectly happy with the 5% dividend and solid 3% growth.
What a beautiful stock
"With the rally today, I’m hoping for a rally aftermarket if earnings is anything above projected!"
I can't wait for the day when bad earnings makes the stock go !
Is this a good time to jump in? Why?
Up on a down day. I added some early this morning. Looks like a good choice.
"4% shares repurchases, 4.7% yield and 4% growth (mid Range) is a total return of 13%. Find that someplace else at 7x earnings"
Not sure why it's down today. The market in total is overpriced and the EPS estimates HRB just gave out equates to less than an 8x multiple. The cash flow/EBITDA generation of the business is strong and they took market share. Taxes are more guaranteed than anything and you get a nice dividend. This should be trading at 12-16x P/E and it would be a $30+ stock while still low priced even by historical norms. Definitely a buy on the dip today.
"Check history and last 12 months. Most of the companies stock prices go down after reporting higher earnings initially , but in few days it will start climbing to new highs -every month. Not sure why, but do not sell if earnings are improving and dividends are better than banks or bonds."
