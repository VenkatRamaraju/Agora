Fortunate to have bought this stock after the market crash in 2009 and I anticipate another big leg up over the next few years as topline optics improve with the transition to cloud going from headwind to tailwind. Actually think it would already be much higher if people viewed them as willing to listen to takevover offers. If Mr. Trefler ever suggested he is ready to retire and willing to sell the company then you would probably see a 30% pop.

"PEGA is finally getting the AI message out. Hard to believe they haven't given it more visibility but the same time, Trefler has never really pumped this stock as far as I know since I first bought it in 1998. Now it's AI attributes are getting out there in the light of day and I'm sure that's what the price action has been about the past two days. Expecting another multi year run, maybe not the 60-bagger since I added to my position in 2002, but at 1/20th the market cap of CRM it has lots of room. Should be fun."

"#$%$!!!!! Buyers: What is on your alleged mind? PE is north of 94. Even if it were a take-out target. Would it make sense for someone like $CRM to overpay this much.Short story: Once upon a time, a money manager bought Keurig for my account. Paid over $75. ""Take out target"" He was right. It did get bought - at $50. I fired him. Moral: take outs can be below the irrational exuberance price"

"Joe,you obviously have collected a lot of opposition research from the Trump campaign and feel a need to share it with the world. Thanks for your concern, but this is a forum for a stock, $PEGA. I have owned PEGA for years. When I want to get information about Bill Clinton, I can go many other places. This is one of the only places that is probably inhabited by people who are interested in whether or not their PEGA stock is going to be going up or whether CRM, when they stop fooling around with buying Twitter, will turn their sights on a company, PEGA, that could integrate with them and expand their offering.If CRM comes after PEGA, what would they offer? $50? $75? $100?"

"PEGA all time high today. Yesterday and today have shown a nice price rise on average to a little below average volume. Not sure if it's so much buyer related vs. nobody selling. One thing's for sure, nobody is selling right now....obviously that could change on new info or earnings in 4 weeks. Wonder what this stock can do when the SaS / recurring revenue model fully kicks in over the next 18 months. Long PEGA since 1999."
Anybody knows what is the future of PEGA?
It isn't down at all - someone tried to sell 10 shares to make everyone think it is down ..... Not going to work as they had blowout earnings and their revenues and profits were planned two quarters ahead.....

"Bought puts. This is just an example of a dumb company thinking that can compete. They have had a good run. I worked near by in Kendall Square Cambridge MA. It's right btween Harvard and MIT. Amazing how this company tries to generate a profit in the middle of liberal fungus tards who hate profit. While these snowflakes are in college, they hate money and Capitalism, but when they get their first job and no mommy tit to suck, they go into shock."
