Pegasystems reached an all time high at 116.49
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"

"AI, Robotics, Automation and cutting-edge Customer Experience systems, I'm amazed this isnt at $200 yet!"
It isn't down at all - someone tried to sell 10 shares to make everyone think it is down ..... Not going to work as they had blowout earnings and their revenues and profits were planned two quarters ahead.....
I know a few folks working in PEGA and they said they are signup business left and right.
Fortunate to have bought this stock after the market crash in 2009 and I anticipate another big leg up over the next few years as topline optics improve with the transition to cloud going from headwind to tailwind. Actually think it would already be much higher if people viewed them as willing to listen to takevover offers. If Mr. Trefler ever suggested he is ready to retire and willing to sell the company then you would probably see a 30% pop.
"PEGA is finally getting the AI message out. Hard to believe they haven't given it more visibility but the same time, Trefler has never really pumped this stock as far as I know since I first bought it in 1998. Now it's AI attributes are getting out there in the light of day and I'm sure that's what the price action has been about the past two days. Expecting another multi year run, maybe not the 60-bagger since I added to my position in 2002, but at 1/20th the market cap of CRM it has lots of room. Should be fun."

"PEGA all time high today. Yesterday and today have shown a nice price rise on average to a little below average volume. Not sure if it's so much buyer related vs. nobody selling. One thing's for sure, nobody is selling right now....obviously that could change on new info or earnings in 4 weeks. Wonder what this stock can do when the SaS / recurring revenue model fully kicks in over the next 18 months. Long PEGA since 1999."
