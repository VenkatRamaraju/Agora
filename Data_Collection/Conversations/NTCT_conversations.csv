Solid billion dollar a year company with analyst projections that look way too low. Increased EPS with slight decrease in revenue. Well managed technology company. Looks like a $50 stock. Could spike back up over $35 per share. You never know. All stocks are a gamble. Not many places for big funds with some profit taking to put their money. Not many stocks out there anymore priced at only $27 per share.http://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=NTCT

"Airtel 5G Rolled Out In Kolkata, Bengaluru – 5G Wave Hits IndiaAirtel Launches India’s 1st 5G Capable NetworkSilicon Valley of India, Bengaluru and superstar metropolis of yesteryears, Kolkata have become the lucky Indian cities to get India’s first 5G cities. Airtel has just deployed Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), which has been claimed to be India’s first 5G capable network."
"""The research and development alone is costly, but building out 5G networks will be wildly expensive -- even for an industry accustomed to spending tens of billions of dollars every year in infrastructure costs. Rolling out 5G to the entire United States will cost $300 billion, according to Barclays."""

"I've read these so called analyst reports with their price projections on this security and if they handed me that #$%$ I'd toss it in the trash can. None of them even suggest the possibility of a Netscout being awarded a 1, 2, 3, 5 10 or more billion dollar contract from the US govt. or through the companies they already have contracts with like Verizon. Definitely no speculation in those reports yet they'll put $87 a share on a company like RGLD that's entirely based on risk based speculation - gambling. Except RGLD odds are a little better than the slots?"

"AT&T to Launch Mobile 5G in 2018Guess I'll be switching my phone service to AT&T later this year unless my current carrier offers is 5G too.AT&T* expects to be the first U.S. company to introduce mobile 5G service in a dozen markets by late 2018.5G will change the way we live, work and enjoy entertainment,” said Melissa Arnoldi, president, AT&T Technology and Operations. “We’re moving quickly to begin deploying mobile 5G this year and start unlocking the future of connectivity for consumers and businesses. With faster speeds and ultra-low latency, 5G will ultimately deliver and enhance experiences like virtual reality, future driverless cars, immersive 4K video and more.”"
"5G not factored into share price.Company smart. Setting itself up for a huge windfall from buying it's own stock at these levels. They could punch out later at eighty plus a share for a huge cash profit. You follow.Taking 25 million shares off the market will increase share price.The board running the company is definitely gearing up for and look like real street fighters.5G change out in US is necessary for new technology to work. So no choice but for it to happen.5G not mentioned in the analyst reports. If you're an investor you have to realize they will get a piece of that $300 billion 5G pie by default. Analyst reports are no good on this stock. 1 billion revenue projections assume nothing from a 5G changeout. That's just not realistic. Stock priced way undervalue.""This amended Credit Agreement will support the Company’s previously disclosed intentions to execute an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) of up to $300 million within the next several days. The planned ASR will be initiated under the Company’s previously disclosed 25 million share repurchase program.""Guy can't lose by buying back his own shares at these levels. Their is going to be a huge windfall of cash for someone purchasing this stock at this extremely low price level. Might as well be the company instead of some fund.A brilliant move on the part of the company."

"How 5G will impact the future of farming and John Deere's digital transformation.In rural America, 5G technology could enable new precision agriculture capabilities on farm equipment leveraging real-time connectivity.http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-5g-will-impact-the-future-of-farming-and-john-deeres-digital-transformation/All of the in-process, or not discussed yet, 5G applications robotics etc. - the most critical part of the 5G will be having intelligence on the performance of the network and having non-disruptive communications. Without seamless operation at full application designed 5G speeds the automobile, farm tractor, telephone, drone, whatever it may be will not work and the product would be considered unreliable, in some scenarios dangerous, like automobile, tractors, aircraft etc. something non of the companies either selling or planning to sell 5G products will be able to market if that's the case.So a company like NTCT expertise and services will be in demand and are the critical part of the 5G operation. To implement seamless reliable full 5G speed operation. Companies will bring in this type of consultative expertise early on.5G and operations of vehicles is not like your cell phone service not working for awhile. On a 5G network an entire cities traffic could be shut down. Accidents everywhere. Total chaos and disruptions. Preventing that from happening, the responsibility, falls into the hands of companies i.e. that's what NTCT's specialty is.5G buildout not factored into share price. 5G not factored into projected revenues. Stock undervalued."

"Taking 5G to the edgeAs standards continue to develop, 5G will advance and won’t just be about faster speeds on your phone. It will also mean much lower latency, which will be enhanced by a new range of applications utilizing edge computing.A quick primer: latency refers to how long it takes for the network to recognize you’ve requested a chunk of data and to start sending you that data. For example, it’s the brief delay between the moment you press play on a streaming video app and the moment the video shows up on your screen.We expect future 5G technologies will eventually allow future driverless vehicles to make real-time decisions based on information that goes beyond the individual sensors onboard the vehicle itself. Vehicles will be able to “see” around corners, through other vehicles, and at longer distances. This will enable vehicles to quickly make sense of their environment and help guide safe operations on the road.That’s what we mean about 5G unlocking a new level of experiences beyond just speed.The entire automotive industry... Google self driving cars... 5G coming quickly... and preventing attacks and disruptions on these 5G networks i.e. preventing a car accident will be paramount."

New nationwide 5G US network coming. RGLD is a company based on mineral speculation. If you have an environmental impact issue or they dig in the ground and the gold's not there vs NTCT and the future 5G network? NTCT at $28 vs a company based on speculation and limited resources at $87.79 per share. I don't get it.
