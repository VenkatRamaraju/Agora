"We all know GM will be in 60 to 80 in october, I would think it is a good opportunity right now to load up."
"Drove by the nearby GM dealership and where the new trucks were always displayed along the roadside it's all used pickups of various makes. Only a handful of used sedans and a few new SUV's. This chip shortage isn't getting better, sure living in Canada means America gets priority so I'm sure chips are used in pickups destined for American customers. Still must be hard on sales staff."
"GM did nothing wrong, LG Chem is 100% at fault for supplying defected batteries to them.- LG Chem will cover a large percentage of the total $1.8 billion cost as they did with Hyundai.- All future GM EV's will use their Ultium batteries and not these old LG ones."
"Both F & GM have been in an almost identical 11-week down trend - not so with Toyota, VW or Stellantis, which have largely sideways/a little up over the same period. So, if it was truly all about chip supply, this the peer group would likely have been tracking each other, but that not been the case.As other commenters have suggested, F & GM seem to be in the grips of a steeper the usual summer slowdown amplified by algos & shorts (affecting many other value plays as well), because the numbers they have both posted have been good to excellent through 1H and despite some headwinds, the economy is not falling off a cliff and demand is unlikely to substantially weaken.Further, despite the jumpiness around the Fed's taper talk, the Fed will likely postpose any action if the economy show signs of slowing if the trends from the Delta variant going into 3Q/4Q continue to accelerate. - ergo, continued more easy money.So, if you have the money sit tight and/or buy - the trend and negative sentiment will turn at some point, although seeing this value destruction has been a frustrating exercise, no doubt!"
"So called auto shortage is really a customer shortage. Toyota has already cut production by 30% to handle the diminished demand. With Tesla stealing sales, GM and other domestic car manufacturers are going to be hurting big time. Its going to be a long cold winter."
"“In rare circumstances, the batteries supplied to GM for these vehicles may have two manufacturing defects — a torn anode tab and folded separator — present in the same battery cell, which increases the risk of fire,” the company said in a statement.The definition of rare is something that exists in limited quantitiesSo rare that every Bolt is being recalled."
"Today’s pop was expected after yesterday’s gap down as well as the hammer daily candlestick. The 2 to 1 probability of green today is merely playing out, . Swing-trade here."
"BREAKING: Another Tesla crash has happened with their Autopilot, this is the result of deceptive marketing from Elon and Tesla about their Autopilot and FSD promises. Tesla has admitted to regulators that they're at level 2 autonomy, while GM's Cruise is testing level 4 autonomy with driverless cars already in certain cities. Tesla's autopilot is already being investigated by the federal gov (NHTSA). Cruise is the real gem of General Motors. Microsoft, Honda, Walmart, and Softbank have all bought equity into Cruise and it's currently valued at $30 billion dollars. This will be a major growth driver for GM in the future."
"So explain to me how this works. GM has hundred of thousands of 2021 autos sitting in big lots throughout the country, because they can't sell/move because of chip shortage. These are brand new cars sitting and sitting and sitting. Now we are almost into 2022 year auto models and consumers/buyers will want 2022 models. But hey - those 2022 models might sit and sit and sit due to ongoing chip shortage. But let's not get a head of ourselves.My question is how does GM sell sitting 2021 auto models - when the company might not have enough chips for 2022 models? Just think of the back log of new autos baking in the sun and snow covered in the winter for all of 2021 and possibly all of 2022. Sure GM will sell cars, but not a full capacity. Its like sell one car and put five in moths balls. Math don't workBoy upcoming earnings reports could be scary, with weak forward guidance."
Folks relax  !! The batteries were made by LG and they will have to pay for most of the replacement cost !! Buy at the open… once this issue is behind us and the good news on the EV’s release coming in October GM will pop to $65.
"Chip shortage could be worse in 2022 than in 2021. Chip factories shutting down due to Delta Variant overseas and lack of workers. Also COVID vaccine shipments to Taiwan, Japan, etc., slowing and not being used by local citizens. Lastly what happens if GM starts to moth-ball 2022 models (along with sitting 2021 models) when the company doesn't have enough chips for cars manufactured?I've not read anywhere where auto makers will see improved chip distribution'/deliveries in 2022, so be careful here GM longs."
Market seems to be shifting to Industrials and Cyclicals. Hopefully start of a nice run for F and GM.
Thanks for letting me buy calls when this was at $48
"Go GM!!! After watching the interview with Bloomberg, I bet GM will be one of the successful EV manufacture!!! Solid statements from a smart CEO!!!"
"Many Bolt owners are ignoring the recall. I don't blame them, get as much life out of your current battery before you free brand new one."
"BOLT : disaster. Basically brand is destroyed HUMMER: $100k plus and limited quantities. Not meaningful LYRIC: $60k plus - more likely $80+ again limited quantities and whole some love the design, I think it is UGLY and am sure I am not someSILVERADO: when ? 2024??Still think GM is honest about EV plans, roll outs, margins. They keep saying they are a tech software company now but have the worst screens and software on the market. Have you say in their latest models?Oh and OVER the air updates? Is that software or firmware? It is just software unlike Tesla. Don’t hate me : challenge these points"
"When the announcement is made that LG will be paying for at least 75% of the billion dollar battery recall, we should see a $2 jump up in price for GM."
"Looks like shorts have infiltrated this board and are desperately using manipulative practices. They have been downvoting any of the informative posts, while upvoting all the negative. These are most likely desperate investors scared of competition from GM or they have a short position. They must have not realized that 80% of GM's float is owned by institutions. Their impact here has no power over the price. Just wanted to inform others here."
"The GM situation has with the batteries is overblown !! If you buy today you will be rewarded, GM will jump to $52 - $53 in a few days."
Apple should just buy GM get rid of the union.
will be mid fiftys in no time LG will pay for the loss.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Bears and shorts are spreading misinformation here, these are the facts of below:- GM did nothing wrong, LG Chem is 100% at fault for supplying defected batteries to them.- LG Chem will cover a large percentage of the total $1.8 billion cost as they did with Hyundai.- All future GM EV's will use their Ultium batteries and not these old LG ones.- GM made over $120 billion dollars in 2020 during a pandemic, this is pennies to them."
Mary Barra will be speaking at noon today at Bloomberg!
"who put at $77 target on this stock,, they must mean $7 because the stock is a joke and will see that $7 eventually"
if lg doesn't pay gm u can bet gm won't buy any of there products .I don't see that happening
"As I said yesterday, that seems to have been the bottom. Any news and GM flies. Look at PE. Trading this short term and long term. Very cheap here, I think. No brainer to me."
"GM is like that kid movie ""The Never Ending Story"". You know like the never ending chip shortage. The never ending LG/Bolt battery disaster. The never ending backlog of 2021 GM autos with no chips installed. The never ending debt and of course the never ending stock price that seems closer to $40 now versus $55."
"Let's be very, very honest here. For GM to get back on track three things have to happen but unfortunately all three things will take a very, very long time to correct.GM has to correct the Bolt Battery problem and try to win back consumer confidence. You don't tell Bolt owners to park their car outside because it looks nice on the street. No you tell them if they want a home to sleep in day/night please keep your Bolt way, way far away from your dwelling. So Scary. Also within this ""never ending nightmare"" is who pays what? Or who gets stuck holding the bag? LG made the battery but all Bolt owners are mad at GM. LG has said nothing about paying recall fees, yet GM has said LG will share in the pain.Number 2 - GM along with all car manufactures are starving for more micro-chips to be delivered. It won't happen this year and it might not happen next year. Consensus is the ""chip crisis"" won't be back to normal until end of 2022. That is not good news for GM and GM investors.Lastly, number 3 - GM has tons of new cars, suv, etc., sitting in packed lots across the country with no to go, since they can't operate properly without micro-chip. These sitting moth balled babies will so be in direct competition with brand new 2022 car models. With so many new cars just sitting and so many new cars coming out in the fall of 2021/spring 2022 - GM could lose billions as buyers dry up and don't reduce GM bloated car inventory.And please don't pick on my post - because all of the above is the truth. And some times ""The Truth Hurts""."
Chip shortage almost over from new report. So much disinformation from hedge funds. GO LONG.
"This article at least touches on the ramifications for the EV market. Of course, LG may contribute some money but the 8 year nee warranty will cost GM a fortune in replace again when battery life falls in 3-4 years. Also, they can’t make enough batteries and the recall will drag on. Also the residual Values will fall ans be a $100M + hit on GM finance, almost zero new BOLT saleshttps://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/528025/expands-battery-recall-bolt-ev/amp/"
"I bought thisstock today. I feel it has corrected (along with FORD) and all the bad news is out. Chip shotage, battery fires, recalls...and then it bounced hard off the 47 level. The fact is Wall Street looks 6 months ahead and 6 months from now...early next year, I think it will be too late to buy this. I realize there will most likely be a market correction before then but seeing as this already corrected I think the down side is limited short term, and hopefully this will be back in the upper 50's before it happens.I also realize I am wrong roughly 30 to 40% of the time.But I wanted to add another cyclical most other stuff is just flying to high for me."
I just called a dealership about a new Escalade Sport Edition. They only had one on the lot and are asking $14k over MSRP. Not sure how that's possible.
Green is good. Looking forward to see it the $60-$70 range by the New Year.
"GM will test all time high's within a few weeks, catalysts below:- LG Chem will announce in 0 to 2 weeks that they'll cover a large percentage of the recall.- GM's Capital Markets Day event in early October will likely touch on the commercialization/monetization of Cruise, future EV lineup, acceleration of EV product rollout, and Ultium battery tech.- Cadillac Lyriq EV pre-orders start on the 18th of September.- Hummer EV will be the first released EV truck in the Fall.- GM and Ford will get the highest amount of EV Tax Credits as they support union groups.- Bond rates are expected to rise towards the end of the year, value plays like GM will benefit the most.- Chip shortage will continue to improve as East Asian countries continue to reopen their economy."
Mary Barra speaking now at Bloomberg
"LG Chem creates batteries for Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, and other automakers. Even the Tesla Model 3 production in China uses LG battery cells. GM is not at fault here, the issue is a manufacture defect by LG. Hyundai issued a similar recall with these LG batteries and LG Chem covered 70% of the total cost. GM will only pay a smaller fraction of the total of 1.8 billion. This is nothing to a profitable company like GM."
"New interview with GM CEO Mary Barra from Bloomberg (Summary below, great insight)- Barra says EV Silverado will be revealed in the not too distant future and she can’t wait to reveal it to the world.- GM’s Hongguang EV is the fastest/highest selling EV in China- The Chevy Bolt used generic LG batteries, while all future EV’s will use GM’s Ultium patented batteries that LG will help manufacture.- Barra says rest assured that they’re having appropriate conversations with the federal gov regarding the EV federal fleet.- GM’s autonomous driving subsidiary Cruise will provide a key update during Investor Day in early October.- Cruise autonomous ride sharing to deploy in San Francisco in quarters not years away."
"General Motors CEO Mary Barra just announced today in a Bloomberg interview that ""GM Moving aggressively to introduce more EV's in China"". SAIC-GM is their Chinese brand and they outsold Tesla and Nio for the month of July in EV units sold. Tesla and Nio fanboys are shaking."
Throughout the entire weekend and today there were uneducated shorts on here constantly trying to spread fear. Most of them said GM is finished and its stock will just magically end up in the 30's. In reality institutions bought the dip hand over fist as they understood GM had no fault in this recall issue. While LG Chem in Korea was down more than 10%+. The Korean market is pricing in that LG Chem will cover a significant portion of GM's total cost as is expected.
