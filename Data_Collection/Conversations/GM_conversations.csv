Operating profit guidance for 4th qtr half what analysts were expecting. I'm definitely pro GM in intermediate/ long term but chip shortage still a big problem. Watching CEO Mary Barra on Squawk Box and she says chip supply well improve in future quarters.
The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different streams of income that doesn't depend on the government especially with the current economy crisis around the world
"Poorly positioned in cash flow/debt with a largely irrelevant product line, GM is yet again one recession away from bankruptcy."
"General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is given credit by Wedbush Securities of having to navigate around near-term supply and chip issues even as the growth plans is focused on the electric transformation. The bullish thesis from analyst Dan Ives and teams is predicated on GM's ability to convert 20% of its installed base to EVs by 2025 and more than 50% by 2030 which is seen setting off a metamorphosis in the stock valuation. ""In the near-term the lingering Bolt battery issues, chip shortage, and lack of production/supply will be headwinds for GM as well as other auto players heading into early 2022. That said, we view this transition period as noisy but see the forest though the trees on an EV transformation and re-rating for shares on the other side of this green tidal wave journey by Barra & Co. over the next 18 to 24 months."" The firm keeps an Outperform rating in place and price target of $85."
"TIMBER - Last month, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson cautioned the company's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages. Meanwhile, the rise in the price of steel and other commodities has been unrelenting. And the disruptions in the global supply chain, whether congested ports or a shortage of materials like resin and magnesium, have continued to drive up operating costs and interrupt production schedules. Recent warnings about supply-chain disruptions from such suppliers as Magna International, Continental, Autoliv, Aptiv Plc, Lear Corp and ABB Ltd suggest the worst of the fallout could still lie ahead.Get ready for $40's GM longs. Coming very, very soon"
"What are you going to do when this headline hits the newswires next year?AP Release: GM's Cruize Automation ""the only licensed completely autonomous (driver free) technology platform"", has agreed to license the use of their platform to Tesla, Ford, BMW, Volvo, Honda, Toyota and 15 other worldwide car makers.You see..... GM's future is not about how many EV's you are going to produce and sell. The BIG money knows this is coming. By the time this headline hit's you'll be TOO LATE."
"It’s funny how there are headlines about how Tesla has managed the chip shortage better than competitors. Last time I checked Tesla sells 500,000 vehicles vs 6,800,000 vehicles General Motors sells. It’s a lot easier to find x13 less chips. Anyway, looking forward to tomorrow. I will be exercising my options in January regardless of the results tomorrow."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
TIMBER - GM soon to test $48 to $50 level before dropping further. Chip shortage will be worse next year and that's coming from Chip Manufacturers. I sure believe Chip company's over what ever GM tries to spin.
"There is so much unlocked value in this companyBefore the whole thing gets twisted together, maybe it's time to IPO and spin the technology side and let the ICE piece pay a dividend, deal with the union and dwindle down.It's time that the generation of the board and the management step aside. This 60-70 year old generation got us to where we are today."
"earning beat == bad news, wall st. doesn't like companies that beat and guide higher; it's all about concept stock; Marrie Barr just needs to come up with a good bedtime story and stock will fly like tesla. Tesla valuation went up 60 billion by announcing Hertz buying 100000 cars. GM should give AVIS 1 million free electric cars, maybe stock will pop 100 billion."
"I don’t see how GM will “absolutely” catch Tesla’s EV sales in 2025 like the CEO said. I see many Teslas and more and more $F Mustang Mach-E Electric SUV but no GM electric cars in the place where I live, and I live in a very large metropolitan area with more than 8 million people. By the way, I think the Ford Mach-E is very beautiful, especially the rear end."
so just checking here TSLA makes a 4.2 Billion dollar (promise to buy you cars) deal with Hertz and their stock goes up 180 Billion. GM brings earns very respectable numbers during a well know chip shortage and an obvious pandemic and they are shorted - does that make sense to you ?
"Insight into the market around earnings : :Large traders are virtually all selling on the earning ""beats"". not just GM, all the earning beats considered ""good"" but not ground breaking, are bring sold, if it's a Bad earning report they are sliding 10%. this is starting to look like a selloff to me."
"I'll post one more summary for anyone surfing around or considering these names. Investors have written off recreational products as dead. Most of these trade in the low teens or single digits, which is a serious discount to the market. Comps may be tough, but business is still booming. Consumers have records amount of savings to spend in the next year. Supply chain problems are working themselves out. Backlogs will take two to three years just to restock to historical levels. With some of these stocks, simple PE expansion to the normal ratios mean they would almost double.I would even lump outdoor products like $JOUT and $VSTO and autos like $F and $GM in here too. Totally unloved and poised for huge upside in the next 12 months.$WGO $THO $BC $PII $HOG $LCII $PATK $MBUU $MCFT $HMC"
"I so tried to get you GM longs to listen. Ford has a HUGE beat, reinstates dividend, Amazing EV line up, Rivian and Argo monetisation, hybrids as a transition to EV, still massive cost savings to support cash flow and profit. Look at GM- modes will be coming we promise, we will not IPO cruise, IPO Brightdrop never, here is your dividend : 0"
"OMG - Train Wreck ComingSeveral auto executives, see chip shortage lasting into 2023 and that includes some executives like Daimler AG's chief executive, Ola Kallenius. GM now due to chain supply issues and chip shortage going into 2023 could see its stock price Cut In Half. Careful longs or you could lose everything"
"Here are the numbers:Adjusted earnings: $1.52 a share vs. 96 cents a share estimate, according to RefinitivRevenue: $26.78 billion vs. $26.51 billion estimate"
"General Motors and Ford are recommended by JPMorgan as Detroit turnaround acceleratesOct. 28, 2021 9:53 AM ETFord Motor Company (F), GMBy: Clark Schultz, SA JPMorgan is positive on General Motors (GM +0.4%) and Ford (F +11.9%) after both automakers impressed with their earnings reports.

JPMorgan says it is attracted to GM shares based on both valuation and catalysts like capital allocation and strong sales performance for the recently refreshed full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. Both GM and Ford (F) are rated at Overweight by JPMorgan"
Ponzi theory states whenever an established company's MC is a fraction of a start up peer there is something worth questioning and auditing. There are a number of automobile start ups with their MCs just below or above GM and those start ups are no were near the production levels as GM today.
