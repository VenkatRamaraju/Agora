"And the ""BAD NEWS"" keeps coming GM's way. GM to Bolt owners: Park 50 feet from other cars - The Detroit automaker has recalled all of the roughly 142,000 Bolts sold since 2016 because the battery can catch on fire.And last we heard LG has paid a penny for GM's 2.5 billion dollar (plus) battery recall. Can't wait for GM next earning's call and the pain GM longs will feel down to their bones."
"To all the people spreading misinformation here, and for the 1-2 people who are here to calm their nerves for whatever reason. It's not the end of the world. GM is a cyclical stock, like all auto stocks. Some clarification for the chip shortage issue:GM will close down 8 out of 15 plants starting Monday. NOT ALL of them, like some of the people have been saying here. Information was provided on ABC news. - ALL, absolutely ALL auto companies are dealing with the same issues that GM is dealing with. Whoever says that GM is the only one, or is mishandling the crisis, is simply lying. - GM's Mary Barra, made it clear that the chip shortage will NOT have a negative impact on the roll out of their EV fleet. They are prioritizing their EV line up, and thus the Hummers and Cadillac WILL get released as planned. - This fall still remains one of the most exciting times for GM as we head into their tech day in October, followed by earnings, followed by them releasing their Hummer EV. It's fine if you have a short position and express your thoughts why GM could go down. But coming on here with fake accounts and simply spreading misinformation? really?"

"Both GM and Ford will get a competitive EV advantage over international automakers and Tesla, union made American vehicles will get a $12,500 EV tax credit. Tesla will only get a $7,500 tax credit. Now before you bearish clowns start saying that this isn't fair, remember that Tesla only survived because of government incentives and a crucial government loan early as a company. Without those Tesla would have never survived as a company.$GM $F"
"Both F & GM have been in an almost identical 11-week down trend - not so with Toyota, VW or Stellantis, which have largely sideways/a little up over the same period. So, if it was truly all about chip supply, this the peer group would likely have been tracking each other, but that not been the case.As other commenters have suggested, F & GM seem to be in the grips of a steeper the usual summer slowdown amplified by algos & shorts (affecting many other value plays as well), because the numbers they have both posted have been good to excellent through 1H and despite some headwinds, the economy is not falling off a cliff and demand is unlikely to substantially weaken.Further, despite the jumpiness around the Fed's taper talk, the Fed will likely postpose any action if the economy show signs of slowing if the trends from the Delta variant going into 3Q/4Q continue to accelerate. - ergo, continued more easy money.So, if you have the money sit tight and/or buy - the trend and negative sentiment will turn at some point, although seeing this value destruction has been a frustrating exercise, no doubt!"

"Deutsche Bank adds General Motors to its Catalyst Call Buy List. They believe the large pullback offers a compelling opportunity to get in before GM’s highly anticipated event in early October. During this event GM will expand on EV strategy, product and technology, Cruise autonomous driving milestones, and how to commercialize and monetize Cruise. They give a $68 PT.Their comments below:""We believe the large pullback in the stock offers a compelling opportunity to accumulate the stock going into the much anticipated Capital Market Days in early October. While 2Q results and 2021 guide came in soft, we think 2Q was impacted by one-time warranty charges that will reverse and management set an easy bar for 2H assuming lower volume sequentially as a result of chip shortage. We believe investors should take advantage of yesterday’s pronounced pullback in the stock to accumulate ahead of GM’s October 6-7 CMD where management could share additional insights into its EV strategy, product and technology, and Cruise could provide updates on its AV milestones.We would expect GM to potentially announce an acceleration of its EV product rollout, with high-volume models coming sooner, potentially resulting in higher EV sales targets. GM could also share insights into the planned economics for its EV business and how returns could match those from ICE models. Finally, GM could provide an update on timing for commercialization and potential monetization of Cruise.”"

This fall is definitely one of the most exciting times for GM. They will be releasing their Hummer EV, have their tech day in October where they talk about bright drop. I don't know if I could back some of people here saying GM will hit $70/80 by the end of the year, however I definitely see it finishing around $60. 6 P/E for a company that is as profitable and has cash flow like GM does, is just disrespectful. Coca Cola has a higher P/E for crying out loud. I wouldn't short a stock that is one of the cheapest out of all competitors, and only one of the few that actually makes money.

"From the Motley FoolGeneral Motors has been working on fuel cells for more than 50 years, giving it the foundation and technical knowhow to quickly adapt if fuel cells go mainstream as soon as Hyundai hopes. It also has a range of battery and other green powertrains to fall back on in the meantime, and is spending more than $35 billion on various forms of clean tech through 2025 to build on the research it has done. I'm not convinced hydrogen fuel cells will ever be the big winner some hope they will be when it comes to passenger vehicles. What makes GM the best fuel cell stock is the company's work to expand the potential total addressable market for its tech as widely as possible. The company has a deal with Navistar to supply its Hydrotec fuel cell power cubes for use in commercial trucks. It has also partnered with Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies to use its battery and fuel cell technologies on a new generation of freight locomotives. It even is involved in a demonstration project with privately held Liebherr Aerospace to explore the use of hydrogen to power aircraft. If the transportation industry's green revolution plays out how I think it will, with batteries replacing gasoline vehicles and hydrogen replacing larger diesel-powered vehicles, General Motors has the potential to win in both areas.

Call the Open - $44 or $45 but unfortunately that's not the bottom. I was long GM for a while but now just watching the slow fall. Obviously the company is going to have to alter forward guidance with the 1.8 billion dollar battery recall and various plant closings. I won't nibble until chip shortage is resolved and that could be mid-2022 or longer.
TIMBER - No the Bolt recall is not 2 billion. Its more like 6 Billion with LG just picking up 25%.TIMBER - Frustrated Chevy Bolt owners want their money back after massive recall

I’m not quite ready to replenish my stake, but I’m definitely getting interested.

The fact is Wall Street looks 6 months ahead and 6 months from now...early next year, I think it will be too late to buy this. I realize there will most likely be a market correction before then but seeing as this already corrected I think the down side is limited short term, and hopefully this will be back in the upper 50's before it happens.I also realize I am wrong roughly 30 to 40% of the time.But I wanted to add another cyclical most other stuff is just flying to high for me."
GM showing strength when the market was bloody and has been consolidating near $49 nicely. Shorts can't even manage to break it down as institutional buyers eat this discount up. The next leg up will happen this month and we'll be back near the mid 50's. LG Chem will announce soon that they'll cover majority of the Bolt recall cost and this will be the crucial catalyst needed.
"Let's be very, very honest here. For GM to get back on track three things have to happen but unfortunately all three things will take a very, very long time to correct.GM has to correct the Bolt Battery problem and try to win back consumer confidence. You don't tell Bolt owners to park their car outside because it looks nice on the street. No you tell them if they want a home to sleep in day/night please keep your Bolt way, way far away from your dwelling. So Scary. Also within this ""never ending nightmare"" is who pays what? Or who gets stuck holding the bag? LG made the battery but all Bolt owners are mad at GM. LG has said nothing about paying recall fees, yet GM has said LG will share in the pain.Number 2 - GM along with all car manufactures are starving for more micro-chips to be delivered. It won't happen this year and it might not happen next year. Consensus is the ""chip crisis"" won't be back to normal until end of 2022. That is not good news for GM and GM investors.Lastly, number 3 - GM has tons of new cars, suv, etc., sitting in packed lots across the country with no to go, since they can't operate properly without micro-chip. These sitting moth balled babies will so be in direct competition with brand new 2022 car models. With so many new cars just sitting and so many new cars coming out in the fall of 2021/spring 2022 - GM could lose billions as buyers dry up and don't reduce GM bloated car inventory.And please don't pick on my post - because all of the above is the truth. And some times ""The Truth Hurts""."

"How did Tesla avoid the chip shortage?Tesla managed the shortage by finding alternative chips then rewriting the software over the course of weeks to make them work in its cars, Mr. Musk said. “It was an incredibly intense effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production,” he said.Tesla stock is up more than 4000% since its debut 10 years ago.The new GM has produced an abysmal annualized total return, including dividend payments, of 5.2% over the last decade, compared with 14% for the S&P 500, according to FactSet. Put another way, $10,000 invested in GM at it’s IPO and reinvesting dividends along the way would be worth roughly $15,879 today, compared with $36,742 in the S&P 500.GM and Ford are being hit hard by the chip shortage.

I am down 8% on F since then but up 16% on GM - so a net 8% (nor bad) . I will continue this strategy as you can expect operations improvements at F, improved chip situation given Japan reliance improved, brilliant models, great leadership, but at GM likely lowered earnings due to chip shortages and issues in Malaysia, more money for the Bolt Recall, Bolt Litigation headaches, delayed launch of the Silverado, uninspired designs, loss of consumer trust after Bolt. Ford will be a beneficiary of the Rivian IPO and maybe even make a $1B SPAC spine off their scooters, GM say Cruise is worth $30B if you believe in an autonomous future but they seem very reluctant to spin anything off that will help create shareholder value.

Tesla's autopilot is already being investigated by the federal gov (NHTSA). Cruise is the real gem of General Motors.

"From the Motley FoolWhile concerning, this could be the perfect time to get into General Motors stock. You often hear about upgrade cycles in the tech industry, whether it's smartphones or video game consoles, but there's one coming in the auto industry that will forever alter the way it's viewed. And GM intends on leading the way.The carmaker forecasts its entire fleet will be all-electric by 2035 and it has committed to spending $35 billion on EVs, self-driving cars, and battery technology by 2025. That is more aggressive than rival Ford Motor, which anticipates 40% of its fleet being all-electric by 2030.Wall Street has a consensus price target of $70 per share, which would give General Motors an implied 37% lift above the $51 per share where it recently traded."
Throughout the entire weekend and today there were uneducated shorts on here constantly trying to spread fear. Most of them said GM is finished and its stock will just magically end up in the 30's. In reality institutions bought the dip hand over fist as they understood GM had no fault in this recall issue. While LG Chem in Korea was down more than 10%+. The Korean market is pricing in that LG Chem will cover a significant portion of GM's total cost as is expected.

A Samsung Securities analyst from Korea says he is expecting LG Chem to cover majority (up to 65%) of the total Chevy Bolt recall cost. That means LG can cover around $1.17 billion and GM's future top/bottom line won't be impacted as they covered $800 million during the last quarter. Would be a great positive catalyst for GM.

"An idled factory costs GM about $50M/moth so you can figure the additional hit on top of the 1.8BIt sounds like they are likely months from determining the cause of the battery issue. There are a lot of ither costs on top of course if this is not an immediate timely recall.It you want to be reasonable you are looking at 2 months and lost sales ok top, so another $200M hit to the bottom line. The again 1.8B or $2B is a rounding error. Worst case I suppose is they never get 100% confidence and can’t do the repair and just buy back the cars and end the Bolt. (Old tech anyway they will say not like the new Ultium) Thag will cost another another $3.5B to but the cars back ans $1B to convert the factory etc and other costs (not to mention litigation) so maybe $5B ans the LG Contributes $1B so a net $4. Asked when production would resume at the Orion factory, Flores said, “Are we going to resume production at Orion two weeks from Monday? We certainly hope so, but we’re not at that point to proclaim that. We have an assembly plant idled because our supplier is not building a defect-free product so there is a lot of pressure to work quickly, but to get it right.”"
Time to Stick A Fork In It. - GM to halt production at nearly all North America assembly plants due to new chip problem.So please explain to me GM longs how GM can give solid forward guidance for upcoming quarter and rest of year when the company is shutting down ALL NORTH AMERICAN ASSEMBLY PLANTS?When you don't make cars or severely cut back production - your revenue and profit margin GO UP IN SMOKE. Low $40's next week.
"This Turkey GM is going down to $27-28. Incompetent Supply Chain Management, never provided forecasts to Chip Suppliers.

I have been shorting GM and Ford, making Bank. Will continue Shorting into CY2022. Earnings and revenue are going to be dismal, below forecasted."

"Intel says it will reserve Ireland chip factory capacity for automakers -Reuters""Intel Corp on Tuesday said that it will reserve factory capacity at its semiconductor plant in Ireland for automakers and has created a program to help them transition to making chips in its factories. Intel, the biggest maker of processor chips for PCs and data centers, in March said it planned to open up its chip factories for outsiders to use. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in April here that the company wanted to start producing chips for automakers within six to nine months to help alleviate a shortage that has disrupted vehicle production around the world. Gelsinger was due to outline details of the new program on Tuesday at the IAA automotive show in Germany. The “Intel Foundry Services Accelerator” is aimed at helping automakers learn to make chips using what Intel calls its “Intel 16” chip manufacturing technology and later move to its “Intel 3” and “Intel 18A” technologies. Those manufacturing processes would be far more advanced than most of the processes used in the automotive industry today. Intel views automakers as a key strategic priority.""$GM $F $INTC $VWAGY"

"o, Lucid just got top honors with an electric car that can go 520 miles on a single battery charge, beating out Tesla by 100+ miles.

Very impressive until I read on and saw that the car was built for the luxury crowd and starting price before incentives was 169,000$.
