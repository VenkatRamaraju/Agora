"Sorry folks, but all I keep thinking as GM’s share price continues to drop is “come to papa”. I sold a good percentage of my stake at 55, and felt pretty bummed when the share price went over 64, but now my decision to capture profits and wait for a pullback seems to have paid off. I’m not quite ready to replenish my stake, but I’m definitely getting interested. Best of luck to all, and sorry to those of you who may have started a position near the highs due to the incessant pumping by analysts and brokers. It’s taken me far too long to learn, but never buy a stock near it’s all time highs based on sentiment. The Wall Street industry is full of snake oil salesmen who peddle false narratives and bogus statistics."
"I purchased $152 calls 9-24 expiration today. Purchased $155 calls last week when price went down to about $150 and I settled for a nice little profit when stock recovered a couple bucks the next day. Hopefully, history repeats itself."
"You know after reading the GM statement below I feel this crazy battery recall is going the way of the faulty Takata air bag recall. Which means it could take years, if not a decade to correct GM battery problem. Heck I've got a 2010 Ford ranger and still waiting for Ford to replace defective/dangerous airbags. So now I read this about GMGM says it is working with LG to increase battery production. The company says owners will be notified to take their cars to dealers as soon as replacement parts are ready. Flores said he is not sure when that will be.So Ford tells me - not sure when we can replace your faulty air bag on your ranger that you've had for ten years and now GM tells Volt owners - we have no idea when replacement batteries will be available."
"As I said yesterday, that seems to have been the bottom. Any news and GM flies. Look at PE. Trading this short term and long term. Very cheap here, I think. No brainer to me."
"When news breaks that chip issue is behind auto makers in Fall, end of year, early next GM stock will jump 20%. You can Book it Dano."
Call the Open - $44 or $45 but unfortunately that's not the bottom. I was long GM for a while but now just watching the slow fall. Obviously the company is going to have to alter forward guidance with the 1.8 billion dollar battery recall and various plant closings. I won't nibble until chip shortage is resolved and that could be mid-2022 or longer.

"General Motors is betting its entire future on electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to power them. To aid the company’s stated goal of selling one million electric vehicles by 2025, the Detroit automaker just announced its new “Ultium Charge 360” service that will provide its customers with access to more than 60,000 public charging stations across the U.S. General Motors is also ramping up sales of home charging stations through a partnership with Qmerit.To date, GM has allocated nearly $30 billion towards its manufacturing electric vehicles, including spending $71 million to develop a new campus and design center in Pasadena, California, the heart of Silicon Valley. General Motors says its “Advanced Design Center” is strategically located to take advantage of the top talent in high-tech given its proximity to some of the best design schools and top universities in the U.S.Clinical Professor of Finance David Kass of the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business wrote in an email to InvestorPlace, “Legacy automobile companies such as Ford and General Motors can be valued more like technology companies when they are able to demonstrate that their forthcoming electric vehicles are perceived to be competitive technologically with industry leaders such as Tesla and Nio. Although Ford and General Motors do not have cult-like figures such as Elon Musk running their firms, there is still an opportunity to increase their valuations above current levels.”Investors appear to like the direction the automaker is moving in. Year-to-date, GM stock is up 37% at $57 a share. ""jeye"""

"GM is like that kid movie ""The Never Ending Story"". You know like the never ending chip shortage. The never ending LG/Bolt battery disaster. The never ending backlog of 2021 GM autos with no chips installed. The never ending debt and of course the never ending stock price that seems closer to $40 now versus $55."
This is the cheapest stock ever. It can easily go to 90

"Why haven't major chip manufacturers (to auto manufacturers) come out as stated when they will be in full chip production? Why haven't chip manufactures come out and stated when things will be back to normal (pre coronavirus)? Why haven't chip manufactures stated how long chip shortage will last? One year, two years, more?All this talk about GM and Chip shortage is picking up steam but instead of blaming GM - I want (now) to hear from major chip manufacturers and find out when business goes back to normal. Or shall I say when enough chips can be produced to make GM very, very, happy.Will it happen end of yearWill it happen mid - 2022Will it happen end of 2022Will it happen later?I need a timeline here instead of all this Crazy Guessing"
"Always the little guy panicking and with weak hands selling to the big boys which are accumulating GM. This story is played time after time and the little retailer never gets it right.

"Chip shortage, huh...Tue, August 17, 2021, 9:40 AMWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories surged in July, boosted by an acceleration in motor vehicle output as auto makers either pared or canceled annual retooling shutdowns to work around a global semiconductor shortage.Manufacturing output jumped 1.4% last month after falling 0.3% in June, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production rising 0.6%."
"I think that there is very little evidence that anyone is buying the dips of GM. First there are no dips, the chart is pretty much straight down. It has lost 15% of its value in the period of August 4 to today or 20 days, hardly an indication of any buying. Most of the auto stocks have fallen because of the chip crisis, the only one which has maintained its value is TSLA, whose investors lack contact with reality. The shorts have been running rampant over the battery issue and the 1 billion has very little impact on GM's bottom line. The problem with the battery issue which makes me hesitant that the stock will rise much above 60 or 65 is the competency of the corporation. GM has a long history of non-performance, The products it made in the 1990s were extremely poor, it required a bankruptcy to survive the financial crisis and since that date it has received little respect from the street with an average P/E of around 5. Behind all this, the one EV product which it does make will burn your house down. Sounds like typical GM.I am bullish on the stock for its fundamentals. I bought it at 29 because it has fallen too far in the pandemic crisis. Its earning in 2Q were good and right now it is oversold and probably a buy, although the chart looks like its next support is 41. However as a company I do not think in the ultracompetitive EV market that it has the ability to compete. There will always be Bolt mishaps. it is just the way GM operates."
"Expanding Matter@expandingmatterChina July EV report just came out and General Motors SAIC brand outsold Tesla in EV's- Tesla manufactured 32,968 units in China, but only 8,621 units were actually sold in China- SAIC-GM sold 27,347 units in China- BYD sold the most: 50,387 ""jeye"""
GM just hit oversold today !! Back up the truck and load up.
Mr. Buffet had some prior information of today's recall. He can now average at a lower price.
"Ahhhh - stop hit today. Three things hurt GM stock near term which made me sit on the sidelines for a while. Bolt news is not good especially for a car company that's going all in on EV. Yea I know GM has new/different battery coming out in new models. But Bolt news still hurts. Second thing is ""chip shortage"" which will be ongoing for rest of year. Your still see GM shut down plants now and most likely well into the end of the year. So frustrating since GM cars are in strong demand. Lastly the market did not like GM forward guidance. Over reaction - maybe. Or maybe sign the stock could drop into mid $40 in then near future. All EV stocks seem to be getting hammered but GM still the cream of the crop. $63/$64 seems like a distant dream so I'll watch and buy if stock heads lower. For the time being there is no news that will pump this thing higher except the end of chip problems, the answer and full repair of Bolt battery and very strong forward guidance. Need all three for GM to move higher."
"A recent CNBC article said, ""Automakers are spending billions of dollars to transition to cleaner and greener battery-powered vehicles, but the new technology has come with an even steeper cost: Reputation-damaging vehicle fires, recalls, sudden power loss and problems getting some of the cars started.""""Anytime you go into a new area of technology, there's more to be learned than there is that you know,"" Doug Betts, President of J.D. Power's automotive division told CNBC. ""There are risks, and there are things to be learned."" The learning curve with batteries is steep for traditional automakers, and battery technology remains challenging even for Tesla, which has faced similar issues."
"OMG - Not only are there not enough micro-chips for GM vehicles, now Chip manufactures are raising prices 20%. Just think what that does to GM's bottom line. Not only will GM miss next quarter, the company is going to give really weak forward guidance. Talk about a punch to da gut."
"Below is a lack of leadership, lack of understanding, lack of trust, lack of transparency...10 days ago - ""GM is working aggressively with LG to increase production as soon as possible.

"Today will be known as the 2021 GM Massacre. $800 million + another 1 billion write-off, with the Chevy Bolt (1 model!!) alone. Quality control and reliability testing not done property at a corporate level. Corporate responsibility to shareholder and trust is worn down, announcing a $1 billion write-off, after market close on a Friday evening. Come today Monday, GM will be punished and anybody with start sense will cut their losses and be clear forever from this disaster of a company, before their impeding second bankruptcy. They were already $110 billion in debt, so what's another $2 billion in write-off right? Oh and ya, anyone I have talked to will never buy a GM (ice OR ev) because of this debacle and their poor quality."
"So explain to me how this works. GM has hundred of thousands of 2021 autos sitting in big lots throughout the country, because they can't sell/move because of chip shortage. These are brand new cars sitting and sitting and sitting. Now we are almost into 2022 year auto models and consumers/buyers will want 2022 models. But hey - those 2022 models might sit and sit and sit due to ongoing chip shortage. But let's not get a head of ourselves.My question is how does GM sell sitting 2021 auto models - when the company might not have enough chips for 2022 models? Just think of the back log of new autos baking in the sun and snow covered in the winter for all of 2021 and possibly all of 2022. Sure GM will sell cars, but not a full capacity. Its like sell one car and put five in moths balls. Math don't workBoy upcoming earnings reports could be scary, with weak forward guidance."
Throughout the entire weekend and today there were uneducated shorts on here constantly trying to spread fear. Most of them said GM is finished and its stock will just magically end up in the 30's. In reality institutions bought the dip hand over fist as they understood GM had no fault in this recall issue. While LG Chem in Korea was down more than 10%+. The Korean market is pricing in that LG Chem will cover a significant portion of GM's total cost as is expected.

"BREAKING NEWS OMG when will the factory start back up. Huge fixed cost!Nearly 1,000 hourly workers are laid off, after being off for a week earlier in the month because of a global shortage of semiconductor chips used in a variety of car parts. Flores said it is costly to have a factory not running, but assembly line workers were warned that the shutdown could extend beyond next week."
"The good news is GM has chips for their most profitable Cars and SUV's like the the Cadillac Escalade and the Cadillac Black wing and the other big ticket units, so without incentives their profits will not be hurt and maybe even better than expected. This is real news from GM's news letter."
"Part of the problem with GM is that it has had a couple of months of bad news at a time when the market has been plagued with uncertainty and value stocks are becoming out of favor. First it got ahead of itself in June and climbed to 63 when it was swept up in the EV craze. Then the chip shortage hit, the Bolt problem, an earnings report which was very good but came with an outlook which was uncertain because of the unknown duration of the chip problem, and Buffett selling 10% to accumulate a position in Krogers. Financially the company is humming. Its 2nd Q revenue doubled from 16 billion to 32 billion, its net income went from a loss to 2.6 billion and the margin increased to 8.3% with EBIT margin of 12%. There is no reason to believe that these numbers will not continue to increase as the economy improves. I got into GM at 29 so I could sell now, move on and be a happy camper. I believe that there is more room to go after all the chatter ends and I am not reducing my position."
"GM did nothing wrong, LG Chem is 100% at fault for supplying defected batteries to them.- LG Chem will cover a large percentage of the total $1.8 billion cost as they did with Hyundai.- All future GM EV's will use their Ultium batteries and not these old LG ones."
Nio has the same market cap as GM. Lol  GM is over 100 years old and is making good money . What has happened to investors nowadays ??

"General Motors filed for the first bankruptcy on June 1, 2009.The second one would be much faster and much easier if GM do not change its leadership. I do not know whether the risk of fires for their EVs is due to the unreliable battery pack, software problem or the combination of both. It means, however, GM did not check the safety and the reliability of the batteries, charging systems and whatsoever. Even the fire was caused by defective LG batteries, someone in GM (probably Mary) should take responsibilities for having decided to select those unreliable batteries. My understanding is that the EVs caught fire while they were being charged or regularly driven. What if EVs collide during driving ? Did GM do the collision tests to check the safety of batteries during collision? It seems to me that there is no leader in GM who care about the future of GM and also patriotic customers who want to buy USA automobiles. The Moral Hazards of Leadership should be fixed and someone should take full responsibility for this incident if GM do not want the second bankruptcy."
"The shorts are out in force. Fact is, right now, we are seeing panic (fueled bu shorts). Then, we see overselling. Then, miracle of miracles, the news that LG will be shouldering most of the cost AND that they supply Tesla with batteries. It reverses and spikes back. Only question is, how long until that reverse? It will be sooner than the shorts would have us believe."

"“In rare circumstances, the batteries supplied to GM for these vehicles may have two manufacturing defects — a torn anode tab and folded separator — present in the same battery cell, which increases the risk of fire,” the company said in a statement.The definition of rare is something that exists in limited quantitiesSo rare that every Bolt is being recalled."

"Over the recent years, General Motors has been slowly emerging from the shadow of its bankruptcy and misguided perceptions of a poorly managed business heading to extinction. As I have been saying repeatedly over the years, GM has been executing well on its strategy and is well-positioned to be a leader in the future of transportation.This leading position also has important implications for GM, beyond the new total addressable markets in driverless taxis, logistics platforms, fleet management etc. It is changing customer perceptions about GM brands by making them more relevant for the future of smart and connected vehicles.Last but not least, while GM is positioning itself as a leader in EVs, autonomous driving, fuel cells and fleet management, its legacy businesses are strong and highly profitable.

"In LG fine prints it reads - company not responsible for any battery defects, if battery used in operation for three month or longer. So in other words GM picks up the total cost of Bolt faculty batteries from 2017 to May 2021. So long $40's and hello $30's next week,"

"Both F & GM have been in an almost identical 11-week down trend - not so with Toyota, VW or Stellantis, which have largely sideways/a little up over the same period. So, if it was truly all about chip supply, this the peer group would likely have been tracking each other, but that not been the case.As other commenters have suggested, F & GM seem to be in the grips of a steeper the usual summer slowdown amplified by algos & shorts (affecting many other value plays as well), because the numbers they have both posted have been good to excellent through 1H and despite some headwinds, the economy is not falling off a cliff and demand is unlikely to substantially weaken.Further, despite the jumpiness around the Fed's taper talk, the Fed will likely postpose any action if the economy show signs of slowing if the trends from the Delta variant going into 3Q/4Q continue to accelerate. - ergo, continued more easy money.So, if you have the money sit tight and/or buy - the trend and negative sentiment will turn at some point, although seeing this value destruction has been a frustrating exercise, no doubt!"
"LG will end having to pay almost half of the 800 million that GM is expecting to pay for the bolt recall. So, that will be a nice positive for next quarters earnings. They ended up paying every 3 out of 7 dollars on the hyundai battery recall."

"It's an hour and a half before the market even opens, GM announces blowing away earnings, and instantly there are 10 articles posted about the stock ""dropping like a stone"". No one can trade yet. These articles were prepared ahead of time to scare everyone into selling their shares so they can buy."
"LG Chem creates batteries for Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, and other automakers. Even the Tesla Model 3 production in China uses LG battery cells. GM is not at fault here, the issue is a manufacture defect by LG. Hyundai issued a similar recall with these LG batteries and LG Chem covered 70% of the total cost. GM will only pay a smaller fraction of the total of 1.8 billion. This is nothing to a profitable company like GM."
They had some interesting insights about GM on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
What can you expect from a company that pays it workers to do nothing? Be thankful we have a Democratic president who will bail out GM if needed.
Still a much better buy than NIO and Tesla!
"General Motors CEO Mary Barra just announced today in a Bloomberg interview that ""GM Moving aggressively to introduce more EV's in China"". SAIC-GM is their Chinese brand and they outsold Tesla and Nio for the month of July in EV units sold. Tesla and Nio fanboys are shaking."
Jefferies cut the price target for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from $68 to $53. such a great company to recommend the same action(HOLD) for price targets of 25% higher and almost 5% lower. excellent analysts. the last time Jefferies made such an excellent guess was around $28 and stock just went up since then. so good news!
"I would buy more and not worry too much, GM is in a very good position for long term."
"Wow, GM trades a PE multiple more akin to a utility company. Probably one of the cheapest stocks in the market at these levels."
You know GM is doing something right when you have scared investors from other boards coming here and spamming. GM is the biggest automaker in America and their scale can't be matched. They have an extremely profitable ICE business + EV growth + excellent management execution. This is a stock you hold in your long-term port and will you'll be rewarded when it's over $100

Don’t ever forget. GM wanted to partner with Nikola for their technology. Oh geez.
"Folks don’t pay attention to the chatter !! GM Truck plants at Lansing, Mexico and Fort Wayne are opening tomorrow Monday the 16th. Load up before the big jump, many analysts are predicting a much higher price for GM $80 - $90."
"Appears hedgies & intuitional holders have been pushing the SP down artificially since the June top, in my estimation to capture the likely large pop from the October event.Similar price action with Ford - no reason for either of these companies to be trading at these levels, regardless of the semiconductor headwinds.Anecdotally, the steep drop on earning day saw very heavy retail investor buying, so as other commenters have posted, it's only a matter to time until a true breakout."
"It took LG Chem around 2 weeks for them to announce that they’ll cover majority of Hyundai’s total EV recall cost. LG will take a bit longer this time as the recall cost is higher. Anywhere between September 1st to September 15th is my prediction, will be a great catalyst for GM that'll remove plenty of uncertainty."
"BREAKING: Another Tesla crash has happened with their Autopilot, this is the result of deceptive marketing from Elon and Tesla about their Autopilot and FSD promises. Tesla has admitted to regulators that they're at level 2 autonomy, while GM's Cruise is testing level 4 autonomy with driverless cars already in certain cities. Tesla's autopilot is already being investigated by the federal gov (NHTSA). Cruise is the real gem of General Motors. Microsoft, Honda, Walmart, and Softbank have all bought equity into Cruise and it's currently valued at $30 billion dollars. This will be a major growth driver for GM in the future."
"Unfortunately GM stock will not bottom until we get rid of chip crisis. When you keep reading ""headlines' like the one below the stock has no where to go except down. Simply because less chips, means less auto sales, which means lower revenue, which means falling stock price. This isn't newton's law of what goes up - must come down. No. It's more like a long building toothache that could go on for the next 12 to 16 months. Which is extremely frustrating for GM longs.GM extends shutdown at Lansing Delta Township plant through Labor Day"
"TIMBER - Ford halts F-150 production in Missouri, while GM pauses EV assemblyMan we're actually going backwards nows with more and more factor shutdowns and chip delays and lost revenue. 2022 just might be an awful year of auto manufacturers if thing are not straightened out quickly."
"If you bought a GM EV with battery fire problem, what would your family and friend say to you?You have no problem at all, GM or LG has tons of problems and is fully responsible. You won't have any loss at all. Now you can enjoy car-free safe life.The only problem you have is you are too innocent. GM or LG will solve your problem soon, within a year if you are lucky. Good Luck!It's like that they are saying that GM is innocent and LG is too bad."
Its comical that the trolls are pushing GM autonomous driving while badmouthing Tesla's. Truth is Tesla's versions has been consumer and field tested while GM's version only runs in carefully crafted test scenarios. That's like shooting down a missile that happens to have a beacon on it.
"GM production shutting down across the board. Could stock be halted today - due to god awful chip news?Electric vehicle production at Orion Assembly in Lake Orion, however, will be down for the next week. It builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV.

"BOLT : disaster. Basically brand is destroyed HUMMER: $100k plus and limited quantities. Not meaningful LYRIC: $60k plus - more likely $80+ again limited quantities and whole some love the design, I think it is UGLY and am sure I am not someSILVERADO: when ? 2024??Still think GM is honest about EV plans, roll outs, margins. They keep saying they are a tech software company now but have the worst screens and software on the market. Have you say in their latest models?Oh and OVER the air updates? Is that software or firmware? It is just software unlike Tesla. Don’t hate me : challenge these points"
"It's sad and irresponsible for some of the fast money guys to promote buying GM and F at the highs, any smart person knew that this was not going to last. GM and Ford come out every few months and get WS excited about their plans on EV, but bottom line they are still way behind Tesla! This stock will test $35 again!"
"Let's be very, very honest here. For GM to get back on track three things have to happen but unfortunately all three things will take a very, very long time to correct.GM has to correct the Bolt Battery problem and try to win back consumer confidence. You don't tell Bolt owners to park their car outside because it looks nice on the street. No you tell them if they want a home to sleep in day/night please keep your Bolt way, way far away from your dwelling. So Scary. Also within this ""never ending nightmare"" is who pays what? Or who gets stuck holding the bag? LG made the battery but all Bolt owners are mad at GM. LG has said nothing about paying recall fees, yet GM has said LG will share in the pain.Number 2 - GM along with all car manufactures are starving for more micro-chips to be delivered. It won't happen this year and it might not happen next year. Consensus is the ""chip crisis"" won't be back to normal until end of 2022. That is not good news for GM and GM investors.Lastly, number 3 - GM has tons of new cars, suv, etc., sitting in packed lots across the country with no to go, since they can't operate properly without micro-chip. These sitting moth balled babies will so be in direct competition with brand new 2022 car models. With so many new cars just sitting and so many new cars coming out in the fall of 2021/spring 2022 - GM could lose billions as buyers dry up and don't reduce GM bloated car inventory.And please don't pick on my post - because all of the above is the truth. And some times ""The Truth Hurts""."

"i thought everyone on here was so rah rah about GM and this so called $77 target, stock seems dead like their battery cars"
"Soft management, constant problems, shareholders worn out."
I am having a hard time to undestand what is going on !!! Does it have to do with the .02 % chance of a Bolt battery fire ? or the cost for replacing battey modules in some of the cars ? It is because of the Chip shortage or just a lack of good news ?
"Just went in ahead of earnings. CEO recently said Q2 will be ""significantly better than expected"" so I hope that's not all priced in already.+"
how many are bag holding from the mid 60's 
"You know deep, deep, down the Auto Makers are not being honest about the severity of lack of computer chips in 2021 and up coming 2022 car models. GM and all the rest want you to think all is well and things are improving daily. In reality the chip shortage is growing and we're almost into 2022 new year car models.What happens when Mary tells GM investors the Hummer and Cadillac EV rollouts will be impacted by chip shortage. Boy if that happens you know the brown stuff will hit the fan HARD."
The biggest LEAST DISCUSSED risk or GM is rare manufacturing defect in an Ultium platform battery. When you put the survival of your company on ONE battery platform - yes you get scale and cost efficiency - but the lack of diversification means a single fire could cause a multi brand recall costing $10B or endless litigation from lawyers who will say the Lyric had a battery issue so now you have to recall the Hummer and the Brightdrop as well. We are talking 10B recalls soon. I bet you by the next filing Buffett is 100% out if not already. This will be in the 30s fast
"I bought thisstock today. I feel it has corrected (along with FORD) and all the bad news is out. Chip shotage, battery fires, recalls...and then it bounced hard off the 47 level. The fact is Wall Street looks 6 months ahead and 6 months from now...early next year, I think it will be too late to buy this. I realize there will most likely be a market correction before then but seeing as this already corrected I think the down side is limited short term, and hopefully this will be back in the upper 50's before it happens.I also realize I am wrong roughly 30 to 40% of the time.But I wanted to add another cyclical most other stuff is just flying to high for me."
"The chip shortage is now largely priced in, and I'm also not so much worried about GM's business model. What I am worried most about is a market correction. GM's is a high beta stock. It will suffer disproportionately if the market retreats."
"As far as the Berkshire Hathaway selling goes. According to the info presented on Dataroma, Berkshire trimmed their position at $59.17. I wouldn't be surprised if they went on to pick up more at these prices. They have been more active as of late, thinking of what they did with Barrick last year."
Green is good. Looking forward to see it the $60-$70 range by the New Year.

"If you own GM stock you gotta love this.While the $1 trillion campaign is set to address several shortcomings in the U.S. infrastructure, the bill has the attention of electric vehicle owners, drivers, and supporters. Some of the budget is set to be spent on the broadening of the EV charging infrastructure.Currently, U.S. EV charging stations are not readily available in every convenient location, and the bill could put an end to the small number of publicly available chargers in the country.The largest charging infrastructure is owned by Tesla, the company that also holds the largest concentration of EVs by manufacturer in the country.Tesla’s charging stations have been installed in over 25,000 locations globally but are exclusively available to owners of their vehicles. This is set to change shortly, as the company’s CEO Elon Musk stated that third-party manufacturer EVs would have access to the company’s extensive charging network before the end of the year. However, this only means that wait times and long lines will increase at the company’s Superchargers.Musk stated on Tesla’s recent Q2 2021 Earnings Call that owners of other manufacturers will have to adopt a time-based pricing system that will limit congestion. With that being said, EV owners across the U.S. would benefit from the expanded charging network, which would likely incentivize non-EV owners to consider switching to an electric powertrain. $7.5 billion will fund the manufacturing and installation of EV charging stations, with an additional $2.5 billion for zero-emission buses, $2.5 billion for low emission buses, and $2.5 billion for ferries.The upcoming Senate vote could be a preview of what is to come for the $3.5 trillion package that Democrats will unveil later.So long $60 and hello $70 this month"
"There is a lot on GM's plate second half of year. Earnings report this week. Hummer roll out this fall. Cadillac pre-orders September. Brightdrop (Huge) order coming this month or next. Cruise increases self driving car start date, years ahead of competition. ETC.$58 plus at market close today but could be over $65 a share come Wednesday morning."
The sell off has barely begun. 1 billion on Bolt recall...ouch. Who is holding this. 25 open on Monday.
No way to spin it - longs. Friday's after hours news was bad for GM and bad for investors. How bad - well we find out Monday morning. Of bigger concern (which a previous posters mentioned) is the fact that GM has serious issues with Bolt LG battery. But should the same thing happen with GM's new ultium battery (going forward) GM stock would drop to $5 a share. So risky when you're dealing with unproven technology. Especially unproven batteries.So Risky
This news is so SCARY for GM longs - Surge in Delta variant cases is also dampening the enthusiasm in the labor market and worsening the shortage of semiconductor supply.Be prepared GM shareholders for chip shortage to be around until 2023. Thus stock will tank over next 12 plus months.
"Was optimistic that GM promoted an engineer to run the company all those years ago. Couldn’t be more disappointed. Mary Barra runs GM like an accountant. Product line is beyond boring. They claim they are going to be an EV powerhouse. Still only the Bolt to show for their investments, meanwhile other major car companies are rolling out pretty impressive EVs. My prediction is Mary Barra will retire before Wall Street finally realizes she has been lying the past 10 years."
"Drove by the nearby GM dealership and where the new trucks were always displayed along the roadside it's all used pickups of various makes. Only a handful of used sedans and a few new SUV's. This chip shortage isn't getting better, sure living in Canada means America gets priority so I'm sure chips are used in pickups destined for American customers. Still must be hard on sales staff."
Short squeeze today?? Watch out. This could end positive today. Could be totally wrong.
"Multiple Lawsuits coming so if you think the 2 Billion recall is all GM has to deal with. Think not. When the dust settles GM might be paying anywhere from 3 to 4 Billion to clean up this mess. And yes LG will pay a percentage, but bottom line - this is going to hurt."
"I hate to say it, but I think Ford is the better play for the next 6 to 18 months. They have a fresh, and much better mix of vehicles to make the transition to a higher percentage of EVs. If EV adoption stalls, GM could have a rough go with their full on push to EV. They already guided to 100k less vehicles for H2, while Ford guided for an up to 30% increase in H2. Analysts are also projecting sequential EPS growth for Ford through 2022, while GM projections are flat."
I have never seen so many thumbs up and down on this board before. GM getting popular I see.

Dems infrastructure bill through senate. House full of dems eager to move on this thing. It should get through and significantly help EV plays including GM and other American autos (mainly Ford and GM) out. This certainly adds value to current share price.
Lots of frustrated uneducated shorts here. We all know GM is quiet but extremely serious to do what it takes to become the leader in EV car…during that time some other mad scientist on drugs is trying to build some humanoid weird robots.

GM will survive but it will be smaller and weaker in the coming years. GM has too much debt. as your friend i suggest highly that you sell GM stock. i care.

There is a reason LG is down much more than GM premarket on Bolt recall news. They are likely to be the ones shouldering the brunt of this recall. GM will be just fine.
"The big winner and loser at the same time is LG, GM discovery will end up helping LG chem to build better and more reliable cells, the whole car industry will take advantage of this. Of course this will Cost LG and GM but at least they found the problems."
Just sold on this news -Surge in Delta variant cases is also dampening the enthusiasm in the labor market and worsening the shortage of semiconductor supply.GM nor any other car manufacturer can withstand worsening of shortage of semiconductor chips. Now I think shortage could go into 2023 and that just awful.
"Just a bunch of noise. Everyone knows chip shortage is hurting sales. They can’t build them fast enough, every car they build is sold twice over. Chip shortage is a short term phenomenon, so is this sell off. Won’t tell people what to do, but I’m holding on, not buying, not selling. It could go lower short term, or it could recover some of these losses. But I am confident it will be higher in one, two three years down the road. Significantly higher. I’m willing to wait it out.

"2. Cruise is worth $20 billion to GMAs previously mentioned, Cruise has raised approximately $8 billion in investments. Its latest investment of $2.75 billion came January-April 2021 from Microsoft, institutional investors, and $750 million from Walmart at the tail end of the round. SoftBank made the original $2.25 billion investment in 2018.These sophisticated investors put a lot of money into Cruise, and you can assume that they were careful in the valuation of these investments. The estimated valuation of Cruise was $30 billion following these recent investments this year. GM reportedly continues to own approximately 70% of Cruise, although this is unconfirmed. Based on these estimates, Cruise would have a value of approximately $20 billion to GM.GM currently has a market cap of approximately $80 billion at $55 per share. We already discussed that it is currently trading at a traditional car manufacturer's P/E ratio, so the $20 billion value of Cruise should be added to its market cap. This would give it a market cap of $100 billion, or a 25% higher stock price of more than $86 per share. Since these sophisticated investors only make investments they think will be worth a lot more, then the value of cruise is most likely much higher.Even if Cruise is only valued at $30 billion by these sophisticated outside investors, it is still a unique investment opportunity. By investing in GM, you are essentially investing at the same price that they did, or potentially less if you consider that GM is undervalued. This is truly a unique opportunity for general investors to participate in an early investment opportunity alongside big sophisticated investors by investing directly in GM. ""jeye"""
"All of GMs full size truck plants including Flint MI, Fort Wayne IN and Silao Mexico restarting after a brief shutdown."

"All of a sudden GM looks like a ""High Risk"" play and not safe harbor trade. Just think how low stock could go if GM gives weak forward guidance or misses revenue targets for next couple quarterly reports. With chip issues growing, the odds of GM underperforming are now greatly increased. Best to watch from the sidelines as stock drops under $30 a share."
"Per Barrons and the actual 13F Berkshire sold seven million shares of General Motors (GM), leaving its resting stake to 60 million shares. 60 million shares worth 3.2 billion dollars seems like a lot of confidence in GM to me."
GM with 108 BILLION. In debt Ford with 152 BILLION both pledging to spend billions more to go 50% all electric by 2040? I think by 2030 one of them will die. Just flip a coin.
How can you give credible forward guidance when GM shuts down various manufacturing plants week in - week out? Seriously - things now look completely out of control.
Looks good to me!
so all this fall from $55 was not really for no reason. is really ugly to do this at market close. I mean the costs won't be so high and will be on LG side mostly for sure. but this brings some question mark to EV capabilities of GM or their suppliers.
"All is wellGM to continue with LG as long as they pick up 50% of 2 Billion (and growing) recall costChip shortage - well its going to get better beginning of 2023Bolt future - Depends on how much LG eats of recall costUpcoming earnings - well don't blame GM. They didn't factor in 2 billion plus recall loss, slowing auto orders, extended chip delays, Delta variant manpower issues, past and future plant closings, etc.Future auto sales - which year - moth balled 2021 cars sitting without chips or 2022 models? Boy talk about horse trading one year against the other. Talk about a buyers marketCruise Self driving car - Not for me if you read what has happened to passengers of NIO and Tesla self driving cars. RIPETC."

"Some say that GM won't be as affected by the chip shortage as Toyota because they are less reliant on Asian suppliers, which are squeezed because of the Covid surge. Not sure if that's true."
"Chip shortage could be worse in 2022 than in 2021. Chip factories shutting down due to Delta Variant overseas and lack of workers. Also COVID vaccine shipments to Taiwan, Japan, etc., slowing and not being used by local citizens. Lastly what happens if GM starts to moth-ball 2022 models (along with sitting 2021 models) when the company doesn't have enough chips for cars manufactured?I've not read anywhere where auto makers will see improved chip distribution'/deliveries in 2022, so be careful here GM longs."
Have to wonder now where the bottom is. Lower $40's or mid $30's? GM can't shake chip issue along with Bolt battery issue. Throw in the fact that Tesla and NIO self driving cars are extremely unsafe and you realize GM stock is extremely risky to hold over $40 a share.

"Institutions and hedge funds are going to take retail investor shares come Monday, then we'll get a strong bounce.

When your entire cash flow rests on overpriced hi end trucks, there is a wealth effect multiplier and portfolio declines cause people to hold off purchases - especially if the feel prices are inflated by supply constraints: bad for GM. Buffett took the off ramp."
"So called auto shortage is really a customer shortage. Toyota has already cut production by 30% to handle the diminished demand. With Tesla stealing sales, GM and other domestic car manufacturers are going to be hurting big time. Its going to be a long cold winter."
SELLING was OVERDONE !GM will recover majority of recall cost from suppliers.
"What we're seeing now are short term growing pains into the EV space. Lyriq is really nice at a good price.How can one justify TSLA's share price and P/E of 350 when they make only a fraction the profit that GM does, and GM has a P/E of less than 6. That is just nuts. I get that TSLA is a good company, but come on, man! Does value matter anymore? Is it all about who's the most popular in the eyes of retail investors?"
This board has lost it's mind.
"Bears and shorts are spreading misinformation here, these are the facts of below:- GM did nothing wrong, LG Chem is 100% at fault for supplying defected batteries to them.- LG Chem will cover a large percentage of the total $1.8 billion cost as they did with Hyundai.- All future GM EV's will use their Ultium batteries and not these old LG ones.- GM made over $120 billion dollars in 2020 during a pandemic, this is pennies to them."

Matt: that was MaryBbarra, general Motors chair and ceo speaking to David Westin on his Detroit special"
Folks relax  !! The batteries were made by LG and they will have to pay for most of the replacement cost !! Buy at the open… once this issue is behind us and the good news on the EV’s release coming in October GM will pop to $65.
bought yesterday @ 48 thinking that was a good price
"I've been watching General Motors stock for a couple of years, ever since Berkshire added it to its portfolio after its bankruptcy. Summers are always rough on GM. It is the end of the year/beginning of the year period that GM shines. I am a shareholder, true believer in the company and I also own a lot of contracts I will be exercising in the future. This fall is definitely one of the most exciting times for GM. They will be releasing their Hummer EV, have their tech day in October where they talk about bright drop. I don't know if I could back some of people here saying GM will hit $70/80 by the end of the year, however I definitely see it finishing around $60. 6 P/E for a company that is as profitable and has cash flow like GM does, is just disrespectful. Coca Cola has a higher P/E for crying out loud. I wouldn't short a stock that is one of the cheapest out of all competitors, and only one of the few that actually makes money. Once interest rates rise a lot of these so called GM ""competitors"" will be biting the dust."
"This article at least touches on the ramifications for the EV market. Of course, LG may contribute some money but the 8 year nee warranty will cost GM a fortune in replace again when battery life falls in 3-4 years. Also, they can’t make enough batteries and the recall will drag on. Also the residual Values will fall ans be a $100M + hit on GM finance, almost zero new BOLT saleshttps://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/528025/expands-battery-recall-bolt-ev/amp/"
"My observation is that the run-up to $64 coincided with posts by youthful enthusiasts on this message board around the same time, when GM's foray into EV was first publicized. My fear is that these younger investors have bailed and now we're headed back to the same old stock that your Daddy would buy."
"Cost of $1 billion on a $73 billion market cap...doing the math, the stock should be down 67 cents on this news. Anything more is an overreaction UNLESS this is looked upon as a trend that will continue."
GM stock languished for a decade. now it's coming back to earth to languish for another decade. GM is just a car company. it will only be a car company. it is not a tech company. it is not an ev company. it is only an old fashioned ice car company with old fashioned management. if you hold GM stock it is no different than taking a rock to your face. don't disfigure yourself. sell GM as fast as you can.

"GM is making some impressive gains in electric vehicle range and they might be about to make a HUGE leap forward with a new disruptive tech from Ideal Power (IPWR). IPWR's patented, highly efficient bi-directional power switch has ratings of up to 5X vs. traditional IGBT devices (in terms of conduction loss reduction). Not sure who the TOP TEN GLOBAL Automaker who's mentioned in the recent news story from IPWR is, but GM was the first one that came to mind for me. I am digging into this one, if you have any insight, let's compare notes."
"gm stock will probably dip down a lot. the market is going to be skeptical of Ultimum as a result of bolt recall. if Ultimum is good, gm will climb up again. but right now and until October lyriq hummer tech investor day event, with Delta overwhelming a lot of us hospitals, gm will run sideways at best, into the mid 30s at worst."

"You know - No one has come out in the last several months and said exactly when ""CHIP SHORTAGE"" will end. No one. So long term investors in GM are trading blind, not knowing if GM will get enough chip this year, or next year or even come 2023. GM has not come out and said when Chip issues will be resolved. So how can anyone buy and hold this stock if no one knows when this ""nightmare"" chip issue is going to end?Bottom line - Do not buy and hold any auto stock until you hear the CEO say ""we now have all the chips we need"" to try to sell our moth-balled fleet of new 2021 cars, suv's and trucks, which total in the hundred of thousands. And just think if chip issue are not resoled by 2022. There will be millions of autos, suv's and trucks sitting dormant in every vacant lot in America.

"GM said it will seek reimbursement from its battery supplier, LG.The largest U.S. automaker said the recall covers all remaining Bolt vehicles not previously recalled in July.

"I am out! Long time holder. BUT looking at the warranty costs $11,500 PER vehicle. That is jut 1 car.Can you imagine the recall costs if Bolt have any more issues for the 2020 on models. And that is not Ultium which sounds amazing but is not multi-year field tested. One problem and recalls costs could hit billions across entire lines since they have the same underlying battery architecture. This is a major OVERLOOKED worry of EVs over OEM that is not well studied. This will keep PE down markedly in the years ahead."
I'm out and might re-visit in the $35 range. I'd consider Ford if it drops to $6 but I believe Ford has more debt than GM. What a disasterFord Motor Co. will halt F-150 pickup truck production next week at its Kansas City Assembly Plant in Missouri and General Motors Co. is halting assembly of its all-electric Chevrolet Bolt because of the continuing global semiconductor shortage.
"From Credit Suisse..........GM posted a 2Q beat while also raising ’21 guidance. However, we expect the stock reactionto be negative today given a 2H outlook significantly below consensus, providing a reset onexpectations.EPS of $1.97 came ahead of consensus $1.82, but below CS $2.37. EBIT of $4.1bn beatconsensus $3.4bn, but missed vs. CS $4.8bn, and came in at the low end of the implied 2Qguide of $4-5bn. Vs. our estimates, while NA volume/mix/price and GMF provided robustbenefits, NA cost was more of a drag than anticipated.Moreover, while 2021 guidance was raised, the 2H guide came in below consensus. 2Himplied EBIT guidance of $3-5bn was below consensus $6.6bn, and lower than the likelybuyside bar of $6bn.Clearly the 2H guidance represents somewhat of a splash of cold water and a reset onexpectations."

"I sold this hyped stock some weeks ago and so glad I did. It's plunged. This stock was so HYPED I almost began to believe it.

In other words, he's not impressed with all the pundits HYPE, particularly on CNBC. Good luck to the folks still in this. You will probably need it."
You can GUARANTEE an announcement next week of a class action lawsuit they GM knew about the recall and didn’t disclose on quarterly call or revised earnings. Another leg down on that
I don't know how GM stock will perform this week but since I have no plans to sell this week that doesn't matter. Selling now hoping to time the right re entry point will only mean missing out on several $2 plus up days as the shares rebound over the next year. The $64 high reached back in June will be surpassed as the EVs and Ultium batteries begin to roll out in volume.

Chip shortage almost over from new report. So much disinformation from hedge funds. GO LONG.
"Market overall has sold off. Everything is down i don't have one green stock today and i have a diversified portfolio. This thing with Car manufactures and Chip shortage is crazy. You would think chip companies would be screaming green but look at them especially TSMC WHAT A DOG! GM and Ford have so many new models coming out that this is a no brainer. Just Hold and this will be much higher by next quarter. The market is dull no real news, all you hear is delta variant and more fear again with closures and economy slow down. People the virus is hear but the world is going to keep turning. This world loves to thrive on this pandemic and talk about it everyday. Now the latest Afghanistan what a cluster that is! Reminds me of Viet Nam and Iraq. American's spends Trillions trying to make these countries change their political view and 1000 s of years of lifestyle. If they do not want to change and are being forced it will never work. We can blow them to smithereens but look Taliban is back. It happened to Russia before us. Two of the biggest power on the face of the earth couldn't control them. So pull the hell out and learn a lesson and lets get back to worryong about this country because uncle Joe does not have a clue of what's going on in this country! He still thinks his policies are golden as the rest of the world laughs in our Face!"

"MSNBC 8/23/2021 8:38:37 AM: ...lastly here General Motors is expanding a recall to include all chevy bolt electric model vehicles sold worldwide to fix a battery problem that could cause fires potentially. the new recall adds about 73,000 bolts from the model years of 2019 to 2022 to a previous recall of 69,000 vehicles made from 2017 to 2019. that latest recall will cost about $1 billion. the company said owners should limit charging to 90% of capacity and park those vehicles outdoors until that battery is replaced. Again no mention of GM going after the supplier for the cost. ""jeye"""
"GM said Friday that the potentially defective batteries in the recall expansion were supplied by LG. The voluntary recall is being done out of an ""an abundance of caution"" and GM will replace defective battery modules with new ones, at an expected cost of $1 billion, it said. GM said that it discovered the manufacturing defects in some of the cells after ""further investigation"" into the manufacturing processes at LG and disassembling battery packs. GM indicated that it may pass on the $1 billion bill to LG. ""GM is pursuing commitments from LG for reimbursement of this field action,"" it said. Folks is not GM’s fault it’s LG Chem the battery manufacturer !! Time to load up while is cheap."
"Boy this is scary if your Long GM.The auto industry this year expects to build 3.3 million full-size pickups and SUVs in North America, according to the latest AFS forecast. Virtually all of them will be powered by gasoline or diesel engines. In 2028, that number is expected to climb to 3.75 million - and only a fraction of those will be offered with electric motors and battery packs.So how can GM make a profit if it stops its gas-engine pickup models which consumers love to switch to EV - which is up proven technology? It's like cutting off your nose spite your face."
Not exactly worried. Just the time of the year. All of the real auto companies have sold off this month. Not that big of a deal

"Deutsche Bank adds General Motors to its Catalyst Call Buy List. They believe the large pullback offers a compelling opportunity to get in before GM’s highly anticipated event in early October. During this event GM will expand on EV strategy, product and technology, Cruise autonomous driving milestones, and how to commercialize and monetize Cruise. They give a $68 PT.Their comments below:""We believe the large pullback in the stock offers a compelling opportunity to accumulate the stock going into the much anticipated Capital Market Days in early October. While 2Q results and 2021 guide came in soft, we think 2Q was impacted by one-time warranty charges that will reverse and management set an easy bar for 2H assuming lower volume sequentially as a result of chip shortage. We believe investors should take advantage of yesterday’s pronounced pullback in the stock to accumulate ahead of GM’s October 6-7 CMD where management could share additional insights into its EV strategy, product and technology, and Cruise could provide updates on its AV milestones.We would expect GM to potentially announce an acceleration of its EV product rollout, with high-volume models coming sooner, potentially resulting in higher EV sales targets. GM could also share insights into the planned economics for its EV business and how returns could match those from ICE models. Finally, GM could provide an update on timing for commercialization and potential monetization of Cruise.”"
Semiconductor chips retrieved from recalled Bolts couldn't be reused?
The reality is GM was down in a boisterous buy hand over fist market. Want to play to the short term auto recovery if you think oversold - BUY FORD. GM is another news release away from a big drop. With so many great stocks even value plays who wants GM
How can you go long knowing lower lows are coming. Especially with chip issue and slipping revenue? I mean GM has not solved there bolt battery issue while battery shortage could go into 2023. So please do tell how GM gives forward guidance when everything is slipping backwards.
I’ve been buying since the 20’s and adding since 52. Will add daily and sell my Microsoft if this hits 35. This will be 3 digits within 18 months.
"you can pretty much ignore the critics here, 84% of this stock is owned via institutional level traders and they alone control the price. Will it go up ? ... well the longer you hold it down I think the more it will correct upwards when the chip shortage is over."

GM with 108 BILLION. In debt now adding another BILLION. By recalling the BOLT is this a repeat of what they did to their EV1 Are they going to start crushing Bolts ??
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Still no answer for Bolt battery crisis. Which means GM could be forced to give 60,000 Bolt owners brand new EV cars for full compensation? Talk about a massive financial hit to GM's bottom line.And remember Lemon laws can force car manufacturers to give car owners full refund or possible new car replacement. YIKES"
So how big of a hit does GM stock take when CFO comes out and warns of missed earnings numbers and weak forward guidance? My guess is the stock could drop $10 with that news.
THE AUTO MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO GROW: Covid and future pandemics will require social distanced isolated Transportation that only autos can provide. Mass transit will continue to deteriorate.
