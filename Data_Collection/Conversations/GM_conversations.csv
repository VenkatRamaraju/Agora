"This stock is stuck in the mud, until it declares a dividend. GM is limiting there investigators. Supply outweighs demand. Nvda, Msft, AAPL and so on growth stocks with a dividend. You can be both"
GM beats on earnings and it's down nearly 5%. Makes no sense.
"Oh there will be earning disappointment. Then add Bolt train wreck, on going chip shortage and chain supply disaster and you have the ""perfect"" cocktail to drop GM stock to $48 a share, if not lower.Cheers"
If TSLA goes above $1100 I'll turn the ice pick on my genetalia
GM buyers do not want electric vehicles. Will never work period. This is already the case now. Will go broke trying to switch to electric.
"I'm surprised nobody has brought this up. These are the year to year (out-the-door) price increases:GM 39.1%Jeep 35.3%Dodge 33.3%Nissan 29.9%Ford 15.6%Totoya 14.5% Subaru 6%Lexus 0.5%Mercedes 0.2%I get there's a car shortage, but this shortage is across all brands. There's a huge variation across manufacters. Some of this might be that manufacturers are only producing their most expensive models. Or maybe some manufacturers are hit harder by the shortage. But my take on this is some makers won't hesitate to gouge the customer for a quick buck while others value their long term customer relationship. Examples of these include Subaru and Lexus. In the end I think this will bite GM and hurt them in the future."
nice bonuses coming for UAW where's our dividend reinstatement??
"I so tried to get you GM longs to listen. Ford has a HUGE beat, reinstates dividend, Amazing EV line up, Rivian and Argo monetisation, hybrids as a transition to EV, still massive cost savings to support cash flow and profit. Look at GM- modes will be coming we promise, we will not IPO cruise, IPO Brightdrop never, here is your dividend : 0"
What a great buying opportunity! Guided to the high end of estimates and chip shortage easing! This stock will roll next year! Get it here when it’s on sale!
"Gm has already stated that they will reinstate $ Dividend this year. Considering Ford has reinstated their dividend , I feel sure that Gm will soon follow suit.! IMO."
The taxpayers won't bail this company out again. ..
"Strong earnings, coupled with positive comments regarding EV and most importantly restoration of the dividend should propel the stock next week."
"Investor Day was a transformative moment for GM, emphasis on growth & diversifying revenue!- Revenue growth: Doubling annual revenue by 2030 to $280 billion- Margin expansion: Improving overall margins of 12% to 14%- Cruise: Robotaxi service can begin next year, potential for $50 billion in annual revenue down the road- EV: Expects EV annual revenue to reach $10 billion in 2023 to $90 billion by 2030- Software & Services: Annual revenue from $20 billion to $25 billion by 2030 (includes OnStar Insurance)- Ultium Battery Platform: Creation & vertical integration of batteries allows for cost & range advantage- Ultifi Software Platform: Software-defined features, subscriptions, performance upgrades all through OTA- BrightDrop: Electrified ecosystem of delivery products/services for commercial customers, contracts already for FedEx and Verizon"
"$52 tomorrow. Investors now realize it won't be until very late 2022 or more likely 2023 before GM breaks $60 a share again. Just too many hurdles like chip shortage, supply chain problems, Bolt battery issues, factory closings, high cash burn rate and slowing sales. Other places now to make a buck, but GM is not longer that."
"GM needs a real leader, someone that is blunt and honest, like Elon. Mary sounds like a politician and she's not instilling confidence, hence the fact that Berkshire has been trimming their position. The batteries of the future are LFP batteries and GM is doubling down on more expensive, less safe NCM batteries. They should have learned something from this Bolt mishap, but it appears they have not."
"No reason to buy now - since GM CEO says Chip problem carries over into 2022, yet chip manufacturers say Chip problem goes well into 2023. So GM future revenue targets will miss miss badly, as EV cash burn increases substantially."
"What are you going to do when this headline hits the newswires next year?AP Release: GM's Cruize Automation ""the only licensed completely autonomous (driver free) technology platform"", has agreed to license the use of their platform to Tesla, Ford, BMW, Volvo, Honda, Toyota and 15 other worldwide car makers.You see..... GM's future is not about how many EV's you are going to produce and sell. The BIG money knows this is coming. By the time this headline hit's you'll be TOO LATE."

"Why does Wall Street hate this stock? GM makes money. Is it because GM went bankrupt years ago and Wall Street never forgave it? Honestly, I don't get it."
"For those of you that have been touting Armageddon due to 'mothballed' inventory impacts. GM has already shipped over half of those out. You'll have to think of another sky is falling scenario now....DETROIT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) is more than halfway through shipping newly-assembled pickups that it had parked due to a shortage of semiconductor chips, a top executive at the No. 1 U.S. automaker said on Friday.""We've made great progress,"" Steve Carlisle, GM's North American chief executive said at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit. ""We're a bit better than halfway through that at the moment and our goal would be to clear out our '21 model years by the end of the year. We'll have a bit of a tail of '22 model years into the new year but not for too long.""https://www.reuters.com/technology/gm-more-than-halfway-through-shipping-pickup-trucks-parked-due-lack-chips-exec-2021-10-22/"
so just checking here TSLA makes a 4.2 Billion dollar (promise to buy you cars) deal with Hertz and their stock goes up 180 Billion. GM brings earns very respectable numbers during a well know chip shortage and an obvious pandemic and they are shorted - does that make sense to you ?
"Cathy Wood just dump more than $100 M of TSLA stock today, other HF and Tutes will follow.. The retails investors will hold the bag !"
Clearly GM will eventually fall below 50. Zero long term plan.
"Ford and GM with solid days. Tesla down after hours on solid earnings beat. Looks like gains are already baked into Tesla, no surprise on a 100+ P/E multiple. Tesla has a valuation problem, no ones dogging the company but the stock is another story. Share price unjustifiable even on forward earnings. GM and Ford on the other hand have beautiful valuations if either of them can successfully navigate the EV transition with huge upside growth potential for the stocks IMO!"
"I believe they will issue a dividend soon, because without a dividend it limits investors. This is similar to owning a home in a 55 plus community. All is great until you try to sell and realizing part of your buying pool can not purchase."
F to reinstate dividend. jumps 9% afterhours. GM 0% dividend.
"OMG - Train Wreck ComingSeveral auto executives, see chip shortage lasting into 2023 and that includes some executives like Daimler AG's chief executive, Ola Kallenius. GM now due to chain supply issues and chip shortage going into 2023 could see its stock price Cut In Half. Careful longs or you could lose everything"

"Congrats to GM shorts - oh wait fhat me. Longs - you can still recoup losses by buying Ford before blow out earnings which will underscore it is not an industry problem but poor GM management - chip shortage management, designs not what people want and grand destruction with Bolt recall"
So when GM misses on Earnings and gives weak forward forecast how low will stock drop?$51$49$47$44$40I'm going either $47 or $44. More plant closing coming boys and it could be worse early next year.
red again today
"TSLA (+4.7%)=>>Receives 100,000-car order from Hertz. The Glory (-.3%)? Receives an order for 12 leather jackets? What happened to GM's first-mover advantage? Great job, America's Tesla!"

"GO FORD, +11% !!"
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM headed 60.0+
"GM's average vehicle transaction price increased by over 20% YoY and inventories at dealerships/OEM's are at record lows, this tells you consumer demand for GM's vehicles are extremely high. Chip Shortage is transitory and GM has strong pricing power. Nearly all American GM plants will be open this week and GM's management on Friday confirmed supply issues is improving going into Q4."
"TIMBER - Last month, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson cautioned the company's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages. Meanwhile, the rise in the price of steel and other commodities has been unrelenting. And the disruptions in the global supply chain, whether congested ports or a shortage of materials like resin and magnesium, have continued to drive up operating costs and interrupt production schedules. Recent warnings about supply-chain disruptions from such suppliers as Magna International, Continental, Autoliv, Aptiv Plc, Lear Corp and ABB Ltd suggest the worst of the fallout could still lie ahead.Get ready for $40's GM longs. Coming very, very soon"
"Insight into the market around earnings : :Large traders are virtually all selling on the earning ""beats"". not just GM, all the earning beats considered ""good"" but not ground breaking, are bring sold, if it's a Bad earning report they are sliding 10%. this is starting to look like a selloff to me."
GM could touch $55 tomorrow as investors realize auto sales are slipping hard and supply chain issues grow also with increasing chip shortage. And just because GM CFO say half the moth-balled fleet of GM car sitting (maybe rusting) in vacant lots over the last year are now gone - doesn't mean jack regarding GM's dropping auto sales. Best to be on sidelines when GM misses quarterly projections.
"Here are the numbers:Adjusted earnings: $1.52 a share vs. 96 cents a share estimate, according to RefinitivRevenue: $26.78 billion vs. $26.51 billion estimate"
"The BEARS on this stock have no idea of what the following are worth:1, Ultium battery technology2. 40,000 car charging units across the US and Canada3.

"And to think, GM had the EV1. Like Apple burning that iPod and cell phone idea they had.."
GM really needs to bring back a dividend. Something like 1.5% yield.
GM is down 4.92% to 54.55
Here is the plan: GM down $2 on earnings miss due to higher bolt costs and the worst of the big ORM chip issues. So I will sell GM short now. Then F will fall 40 cents with GM in sync and I will buy F at the low and hold when F earnings blow out of the water as the have a more competent management and have handled the chips better and have the explosive F150 reservations
How did they do it with near empty dealer lots?
"Divvy reinstatement day=>>F reinstates, up 7.4%. The Glory doesn't; would rather spend your divvy money on cheesy Super Bowl ads about cars that don't exist. The Glory down 5.4%. I get it."
"GM knows they are building less cars, but wants investors to think long term. That ain't working."
"Not bad earning results. Just badly communicated. They let the analyst expect too much for 4Q revenue and then missed it. Yes the yearly guidance was lifted, but not enough due to the revenue decrease in Q4. Should have forecasted $Q lower then beat it.. Mary.......let me know if you need my help for Q1 forecasting, I work at Ford."
"GM is positioning for EV's in a big way. Stop the nonsense posts, this company will be the dominant EV manufacturer in the coming years. Maybe Tesla will have to buy them to stay in the automotive business two years from now."
"General Motors (GM -0.0%) plans to work with dealers to install up to 40,000 electric vehicle chargers across the United States, focusing on areas that currently have limited access to EV chargers. GM will give each of its EV dealers 10 Level 2 destination charging stations to deploy at key locations in the community. The Detroit automaker doesn't plan to pay for all of the chargers, but will work with community leaders and dealers on financing arrangements. General Motors, unlike Tesla (TSLA +6.7%) or Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY +3.2%), doesn't have its own charging station network, so customers must currently rely on third-party chargers. The move comes on the back of President Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which contains a goal to add 500,000 new EV chargers by 2030. There are currently around 41,000 public charging stations in the U.S. The company will also begin selling its ""Ultium"" branded level 2 home and commercial charging stations to customers in dealerships and online. The Ultium chargers are available to GM and non-GM owners and will begin shipping next year. Analysts have praised GM's electrification strategy after the company set ambitious goals in its transition to EVs."
UP after hours. Riding on the coattails of Ford again I see.
The real tell was the surprise Beat
TIMBER - GM soon to test $48 to $50 level before dropping further. Chip shortage will be worse next year and that's coming from Chip Manufacturers. I sure believe Chip company's over what ever GM tries to spin.
"""GM CEO: 'Absolutely' believe we can catch Tesla in EV market share by 2025"""
"I BOUGHT GM. Pre market . Yes I do not like GM (refusal to IPO Cruise shows managerial control issues over shareholders especially) but short term it’s a technical base and traders and buyers will have to anticipate GM following F next quarter and reinstating their dividend. They have no choice. And analysts will say their guidance was too conservative. But this is only a short term trade for me up to $57 and I expect a catch up trade with Ford today. Longer term, I don’t see the GM product that says desire on a mass scale like Ford, they have already rung most costs savings out of OEM, they don’t have transitional hybrids until the BEV market really explodes 3-5 years and Cruise lacks brand awareness like Uber or Lyft to ever generate $50B in autonomous driving - that is some GM fantasy like Maven. Uber will just license Argo (yes Which Ford is monetising next year in an IPO which is what GM should do). So, I closed my short and am now Long for a bit."
Folks hold - no margin pls and we will see 70 or plus by mid nov
"Tesla makes EV cars that cost $42,000 - $200,000. GM makes EV cars that cost $5000 - $200,000. It needs to be understood that Tesla is not poised to be a mass car seller, 4 models won't do it in a world that need 100 different models, what Tesla will build 50 factories ? the first mover advantage actually lays a mirage over future potential, Tesla is having its moment where it is selling 2x the cars annually so they seem very far ahead, but NIO,XPENG,GM,BYD,Ford,VW are all about to hit that 2x volume slope as well. Tesla gets a loose deal for 100,000 vehicles and the stock goes up 180 Billion, whereas GM puts in a pretty good Q3 (way better than most) and gets a 5% haircut. Eventually (starting in 2023) GM and others EV makers combined will humble Tesla's market share. Tesla can not make a $25,000 car never mind a $15,000 one, that is hyperbole. Tesla is actually missing the mass market with no plans to address it yet. Tesla a company that derives its stock price from Future potential versus GM which derives it from Profits today, they are different classes of investment if you ask me. Things will come to pass."
Great Earnings! Way to go longs!
Open Red? Very possible but surely close major red. GM just told investors 2022 will be rough year due to chip shortage.
GM is a very frustrating stock to own. Not sure how much more of this B.S. I can take.
They are bankrupt!!! Remember I said it. Executive managers have no clue what they are doing. All of the great GM employees are retiring and cashing out as fast as they can. They see the writing on the wall. Wait until earnings stock will drop 50% or more. Can’t survive on less than 30% production.

Predictable? WS knows GM and Ford are the safe bets with today’s reaffirmed earnings. They’ve got maybe 6 months or less to sell the TESLA story to LOONs before both Ford and GM EV numbers start to show YOY growth. The HERTZ non-news was proof that WS was desperate for any catalyst it could find to facilitate this (I’m guessing they were holding out for the CyberTruck launch end of this year that got delayed 1-2 years which will now be too little too late).The good news is that the money will stay in the EV sector so when the ship gets righted the rebalanced upside potential for GM and Ford is tremendous.
"General Motors and Ford are recommended by JPMorgan as Detroit turnaround acceleratesOct. 28, 2021 9:53 AM ETFord Motor Company (F), GMBy: Clark Schultz, SA JPMorgan is positive on General Motors (GM +0.4%) and Ford (F +11.9%) after both automakers impressed with their earnings reports. Analyst Ryan Brinkman: General Motors (NYSE:GM) is given credit for its best-in-class leverage to global growth markets, ongoing operational turnaround, and improving product cadence. JPMorgan says it is attracted to GM shares based on both valuation and catalysts like capital allocation and strong sales performance for the recently refreshed full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. Both GM and Ford (F) are rated at Overweight by JPMorgan"
Operating profit guidance for 4th qtr half what analysts were expecting. I'm definitely pro GM in intermediate/ long term but chip shortage still a big problem. Watching CEO Mary Barra on Squawk Box and she says chip supply well improve in future quarters.
I think Mary signaled her retirement date as late 2024 given that sometime in 2025 GM will not have caught up to TSLA
"Just like BA, GM has poor old-school managment that should have been replace years ago. It's a different world out there. Old excuses won't work anymore."
"General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is given credit by Wedbush Securities of having to navigate around near-term supply and chip issues even as the growth plans is focused on the electric transformation. The bullish thesis from analyst Dan Ives and teams is predicated on GM's ability to convert 20% of its installed base to EVs by 2025 and more than 50% by 2030 which is seen setting off a metamorphosis in the stock valuation. ""In the near-term the lingering Bolt battery issues, chip shortage, and lack of production/supply will be headwinds for GM as well as other auto players heading into early 2022. That said, we view this transition period as noisy but see the forest though the trees on an EV transformation and re-rating for shares on the other side of this green tidal wave journey by Barra & Co. over the next 18 to 24 months."" The firm keeps an Outperform rating in place and price target of $85."
Didn’t GM already total flop in the EV market with the volt and bolt?
"Tesla got 100,000 car order from Hertz Global on Monday. Elon Musk made over $36 Billion and Republicons said not to tax him, but they can tax GM and low wage workers."
"It’s funny how there are headlines about how Tesla has managed the chip shortage better than competitors. Last time I checked Tesla sells 500,000 vehicles vs 6,800,000 vehicles General Motors sells. It’s a lot easier to find x13 less chips. Anyway, looking forward to tomorrow. I will be exercising my options in January regardless of the results tomorrow."
"earning beat == bad news, wall st. doesn't like companies that beat and guide higher; it's all about concept stock; Marrie Barr just needs to come up with a good bedtime story and stock will fly like tesla. Tesla valuation went up 60 billion by announcing Hertz buying 100000 cars. GM should give AVIS 1 million free electric cars, maybe stock will pop 100 billion."
"If Bara messaged differently, this stock would be over $60 today."
"TIMBER - With or without the CHIPS Act, we think we still have a rough road in front of us. And I've said we believe the chip shortage is at its worst right now. It will get incrementally better as we go through '22, but we expect the shortage to persist into 2023. It just takes that long to build capacity says Intel CEO Gelsinger.EXPECTS CHIP SHORTAGE TO LAST INTO 2013.

See you all at $55 a share tomorrow."

"3 Month Chart Ford up 20%. GM up 2.7% . I told you there would be a major divergence and got made fun of. Fords models are superior, in greater demand, they have Google on board for software. But best of all, their margins are 50% or GM's which means that have the ability to double profits in the net 3 years on the ICE business to catch up to GM while GM has squeezed savings already and will face just ICE revenue decline not offset by margins improvement. And of course, Ford is much better positioned with Hybrids as a smart transition until EV buying become mainstream. Why is GM so far behind launching vehicles despite all their talk of 30 vehicles by 2025 and fastest time to market for new development,. Ford already launched the F150 Lightening in real record time. I think GM won't go down much as it is cheap, but will stagnate and Ford will zoom especially at earning when Ford beats with 50 cents a share and GM misses slightly on top line revenue and profit as they will reveal a greater Bolt hit than the market anticipates or that LG offsets. Be in autos - revolution coming - but be in FORD"

To date, at least 24 countries have proposed some form of zero-emission vehicle targets. For instance, the UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.$TSLA $GM $F $VWAGY $NIO $XPEV"

I’m honestly surprised GM hasn’t brought back the dividend yet. I’m not talking a massive dividend like before but something like 1 or 2% max. Ford has reinstated their dividend and the stock is surging. I think this will put pressure on GM to reinstate a dividend even if it’s very small hopefully for the beginning of next year.
"Cathie Wood projects Tesla gets to 2.4 trillion valuations in 5 years, with sales of 400 billion, 6 times sales. GM trades at 0.6 times sales; If GM cuts its production in half, there will be no chip shortage, and then project that sales will double in 3 years, maybe stock will trade be 250."
"Increasing EV production and the energy crisis are not irrelevant. The coal usage is at historical high as more EVs were put on the road. The EVs weight 30% more and thus require 130% equivalent fossil fuel burned per car for every EV replacing an ordinary car. Not like solar or wind, EVs has no help for green. Governments accros Europe, China and US need to ban the charging of EVs during bitter winter or hot summer when electricity is tight. Otherwise, normal household would die from cold or heat stroke."
Buy Tesla
Why is this board comparing TSLA ( A cult stock with with big plans) to GM a sick stock with big losses for the next several qtrs???
