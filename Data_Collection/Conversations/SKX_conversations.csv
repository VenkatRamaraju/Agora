"Note: they are projecting net earnings of $0.55 for the next quarter. That's pretty good. No position, but considering picking up a few hundred shares here after hours."
interesting Baron's article this could be the catalyst that proves to break Skechers out of its base and move to new highs.
"All peers are rallying, there clearly isn’t worry about overall demand for shoes and leisure wear. Valuation is extremely compelling both actual and relative to peer group, analyst estimate cuts overall weren’t even more than 10pct . Big sellers on the results news are done , SKX is about to move higher imho"
Look at the volume!
"￼Sales: 866.322.8738Support: 877.322.8738￼COMPANIES AND EARNINGSS&P 500 Companies with More Global Exposure Reported Higher Revenue Growth in Q1By John Butters | May 11, 2018Filter Stories“The world economy will continue to strengthen over the next two years, with global GDP growth projected to reach almost 4% in both 2018 and 2019.” –OECD Interim Economic Outlook (March 13)Coming into the Q1 earnings season, companies in the S&P 500 with higher global exposure were expected to benefit from the tailwinds of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher global GDP growth. Now that more than 90% of the companies in the index have reported results for Q1, did S&P 500 companies with higher global revenue exposure outperform S&P 500 companies with lower global revenue exposure in terms of earnings growth and sales growth for Q1 2018?The answer is yes. FactSet Geographic Revenue Exposure data (based on the most recently reported fiscal year data for each company in the index) can be used to answer this question. For this particular analysis, the index was divided into two groups: companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S. (less global exposure) and companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S. (more global exposure). Aggregate earnings and revenue growth rates were then calculated based on these two groups.￼The earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q1 2018 is 24.9%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the earnings growth rate is 22.7%. For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the earnings growth rate is 29.6%.The sales growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q1 2018 is 8.2%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the sales growth rate is 6.4%. For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the sales growth rate is 13.1%.What drove the outperformance of S&P 500 companies with higher global revenue exposure?"
"I bought at 45, just want my money back."
So moving shipments from the 2nd to the 3rd quarter took the 2nd estimates down by the amount... and that move costs 25% of the company's worth?
"I have to believe something good is going on; Volume is 10 millions shares above normal!!5 times volume, who knows maybe some ""Big Dog"" is going to buy them out!! It could happen!!I love their shoes, most comfortable shoe I ever wore!!"
"It is starting to look like SKX has successfully retested its low of two days ago, and now is putting in an increasingly clear base, with $29 support, after all selling momentum has been exhausted. Now if someone will look at the fact that SKX just reported their best quarter ever, The stock fell 33% after this announcement. Read it over a couple of times and tell me if the fall makes sense to you. LOL""First Quarter HighlightsRecord sales of $1.250 billion, an increase of 16.5 percentEarnings from operations of $148.8 million, a 19.6 percent increaseNet earnings of $117.7 million, a 25.2 percent increase, and diluted earnings per share of $0.75International wholesale sales increased 17.9 percent; total international wholesale and retail sales combined represented 54.0 percent of total salesDomestic wholesale sales increased 8.5 percentCompany-owned global retail sales increased 26.4 percent, with a comparable same store sales increase of 9.5 percent worldwide"""
"It has about 700 million cash, not much debt. It is still profitable, spending to grow. Has good products with market demand. Fall is coming, school kids and others will need new items. Next quarter will be ok. So, can it be a take over target at this price?"
The report is unclear anyone know what their EPS number was???

I would love NIKE to place a bid to buy the company.....now would be the time..based on all the information posted by End2War this is an obvious blip in the growth story for SKX so why wouldn't a company like Nike pounce knowing this low price wont last.....anyone here think nike should make a move? they have the cash and SKX would be a FANTASTIC addition for them.
Did some heavy research on this company yesterday and I feel it is undervalued at these levels. Demand for their shoes is huge and I own Nike. I feel like Skechers has a bright future. I think investing now will be rewarding later on down the line.
"So, the next question is whether SKX will close today over $31 or under it?"
"I thought they reported a loss based on the share drop. they could still make 1.50 eps for the year, right? with a pe of 20 means a $30 sp."
bought at $23.87
MAn am I glad I listened to Cramer 2 days ago and bought $SKX! NOT - it dropped over 20% right after he blessed it.
"Sorry guys. I don't own this stock, but I hate to see anyone loose 25%. Not a short either. Just saying."
"Great earnings for a great company........if Netflix ever had earnings like this, they would be up $200 a share. Skechers has real earnings, positive cash flow and almost a billion dollars in net cash. Netflix has phony earnings based on mis-classifying spending as investments and bleeds cash every quarter. If we were Netflix, we would spend the conference call bragging that we sold 100 million individual shoes (50 million pairs)."
What did I say!?! I said we should be over $30 and here we are!!! Still climbing. I’m very optimistic on the long-term potential of this one. We could grow to be a giant in this industry.
"Meantime, CROX, SHOO and FL are making new 52 week highs today as all members of the footwear group keep flying higher while SKX continues to languish in an oversold and undervalued condition, and specialists and analysts are manipulating the stock, while we see AHs block trades continuing to show institutional buying in the backwaters. When the boys get done loading the boat, suddenly they will discover all the sales initiatives that SKX put in place jumped sales and profits and this stock will lurch upward, so be ready as this discounted condition cannot continue for much longer before the market catches on, IMO."

"Same old, same old. 1 step forward, 2-3 steps back. Oh well, I missed out on TSLA. Gotta find the next overvalued, money losing, tech company with shady accounting and a cult-like following"
"I looked up the Chinese revenues related to that article from a couple weeks ago. It seems as if skx reported $580 ish million in China revenues in 2017 and expected 35% growth. But Mr Willie, the ceo of Skechers Asia said growth would come i closer to 50%. While this isnt a massive difference, its shows that skx is thriving in the rapidly growing Asia market. And the numbers get more impressive each year. This year should be $870 million plus in Chinese sales as recorded by skx. This is now the company's second biggest market. I am not sure why growth cant remain in the 30-50% next year as the brand spreads its distribution points far and wide in China. At the midpoint of that growth range, skx would do almost $1.240 billion in 2019 sales. That moves the needle close to $400 million in 2019. Thats about as much growth as analysts forecast for the entire world in 2019! Clearly we would get hundreds of millions more in sales growth globally ex china. This stock is cheap and lagging b/c of expense growth to support all these new revenue sources. When the company dials back these investments the profit margins will explode on still double digit revenue growth. Hopefully management will see this, and let more profit flow to the bottom line soon. The footwear sector is on fire. SKX MGT OWES SHAREHOLDERS."
come up very soon
$32 by mid week... Let's ride...
32 by march NOT selling the company UNLESS its 60 plus

3rd largest shoe business in the world and people still don't have any confidence in it. Who is still selling this stock down here??
Sold for 30 after a 40% rally since April 1st. Feels risky...
"I think some large institutional buyers may show up in the next 10 days, looking for a bargain unless the market jitters continue to keep the big averages falling. Then they probably will hold off.Assuming the major averages can get back above their 50 day MAs, which is uncertain right now, and the rally can continue on good corporate earnings, I would expect a lot of the SKX drop to be erased within 1 or 2 months. The 1st quarter results were good but the second quarter guidance was weak, while the third quarter guidance seems to have been good. In the current market that is worried about the interest rates rising, and wondering if the rally will be chocked off, we now see many good results being sold down as the current market is taking profits and playing it safe waiting for the dust to settle.If the market were in better condition right now, I think it is possible the first quarter results, which were small beats, could have taken SKX into the $43 to $44 range, if it were not for the 2nd quarter guidance, but instead it was greeted with a huge, IMO, unjustified drop due to skittish late stage market conditions and unlucky timing. There also seems to have been the usual suspects that include MMs, short sellers and hedge funds that worked their attack to drag SKX down in the after hours and kept the pressure on. I would not be surprised if this was not manipulated down persuant to a coordinated (illegal) plan, given the extent of the drop.Now that the pronounced selling has dried up, we can look to improved prospects to show up over the next 10 days or so as the buyers kick the tires and time their moves.My prediction is that SKX will close over $30 by the end of the day Friday. I expect some resistance around $29.75, but if the broad market likes some earning reports and recovers, that might drive SKX back up faster. At this juncture with only 1.3 M in volume, I am expecting total volume today to drop again, into the range of $3 to 5 M shares; but when the institutional buying starts, there should be a lift to signal they are buying. So, if it starts rising, watch the volume to gage the extent of any institutional action on the up side."
I have never understood how a company can watch its stock get crushed without doing anything. If I was CEO and I reported earnings that were great but guided soft into next Q and then watched the stock sold off way beyond anything rational I would immediately meet with the BOD and get approval to announce stock buybck...this would support the stock AND show investor's the company is SERIOUS about protecting shareholder value.....I understand some companies just dont have the balance sheet to do what I just outlined but SKX does have the means to do it.
Hard to explain why the stock is holding up so well after q2 compared to q1.
Price Target raised at UBS from 32 to 37. See it on marketwatch
I'm surprised Nike hasn't gone after them with the stock price so depressed.
"Let me begin by clearly stating that I am neither short nor long on this stock. However, within the past 2 years I had invested in UAA, clearly not doing well on that bet. While not identical, I would classify the companies as comparable (apparel, growth oriented). I was one of the people who tried to catch the falling knife as one particular earnings report spooked investors and I thought I knew more than the market. I was wrong.The news on Skechers delaying shipments until Q3 is clearly a demand issue. While some here are trying to make it out as just a quirk of the calendar, I am very skeptical of this. Looking at the chart suggests a gap downwards to about $24. My guess is that $24 will be tested before $35. If you are an investor in the company for the long haul, this might not be important to you. However, if you are a trader you should likely wait until $24 gets tested, held, and then upward momentum starts again.Of course, I could be wrong here but it seems like I've seen this movie before."
I am amazed how all you hear about is talk about Nike and Adidas on CNBC. Sketchers is by far best in class and sooner than later will get its due. Monster stock for the next few years no doubt and when they pile on in will rocket to new highs easily!
I just added at 29.05
"The Street has been complaining about Net profit well SKX delivered on that, the ""Net Profit number"" was crushed; beat EPS number by .08 cents, or a 33 per-cent beat!! Way to go management, great job!!!! To all longs that held their shares, way to go!!!"
reason for today fall?!
"Solid compound growth since 2013. In the us, 12%, with 15% growth in number of pairs shipped (19M) from Q1 2018 vs 2017, but the real compound growth has been international, 20% since 2013, 26% for Q1, which is probably the best in the industry. The total growth in sales went from $3 B to $4 B in just 2 years, which is an accelerating rate of growth as they do 54% of the sales outside the US, and have a presence through subs, distributors and partners in 170 countries. This is a well established global brand that is growing strongly for 4 full years internationally. It achieved its highest sales for the Q1 at $1.25 B and this will likely continue as they push toward $5B. The specialists are pushing the stock down for their own reasons, but there are a lot of things to like about SKX's real financial and growth performance. It looks like a good value play right now, and the lower they drag the PPS, the greater the value, IMO. Some are selling here to others that are buying from them. Which ones are making the right choice?"
"I don't know about this market anymore, you buy solid companies with good balance sheets, and they tank. WTH is going on??"
$62 Target.......street eps estimates $3.60 2023 & $5.01 2024
SKX never fully recovered from the drubbing it took in April 18' when it reached 43.08 and then tumbled. Now it is taking another drubbing. I suspect that a lot of the air has been let out and will soon rebound to 28-29 level. IMHO
Would you guys buy?
Cramer says buy here...

Why such a huge dip? I don't see anything drastic.
"A large part of the sell off in SKX was based on an increase in expenses, but the thought pattern that this was a ""concern"" is not sound. SKX reported a 24% increase in expenses, which was an additional $73 M jump in G&A, but this included $37.4 M to support international growth and $18.3 M for operating 73 additional company owned stores, of which 15 new ones opened during the first quarter. Additionally, selling expenses climbed $10.6 M due mostly to higher international advertising expenses. By my way of looking at it, all of those added expenses will produce added growth, especially in foreign markets where the potential for growth appears to be greatest. There is no reason to fret about a well funded and well running company, that has show it can consistently achieve growth, spending some funds where they believe it is going to achieve benefits. They are not going into debt or taking on interest obligations. It is a management judgment call and not cause for a 36% wipe out of valuation. Rather it is cause to expect growth will be promoted and will continue. Sometimes the analysts just fret over things that are off base, and I believe this is one of those cases. When you look at all the other shoe companies, following the haircut that the analysts gave SKX, I suggest it is the best relative value out there. Most of the charts show this group is really doing very well, and I continue to argue that SKX makes good shoes, that are quite popular and they are growing their position in the marketplace. Right now, the PPS is oversold and undervalued in my opinion, and I am not worried about the 1st quarter increase in the expenses, so long as they achieve the desired effects. If the 2nd quarter beats the guidance or comes in at the high side of the range, I think there will be a very rapid recovery. In the meantime, it is starting to look like the selling is exhausted, the recent bottom is in, and SKX has plenty of room to move up if the institutions come to the obvious conclusion that SKX is in a hot group of footwear stocks, and has a really nice risk/reward ratio down here. Will it retest the recent lows, or jump on an improvement in sentiment. Look at the numbers and make up your own mind, but I think it is a strong buy right here at $30.46. For those technically inclined, take a look at the Bollinger bands which is another way to look at the volatility and try to project where it might head next. Another consideration is that even the analysts have 7 strong buys and only one sell on SKX so they know it is not overpriced. Please do your own due diligence to evaluate your investments or trades, and never rely on chat board commentary alone."
"I just noticed a couple of 905,000 trades in the after hours at $29.28 and I am guessing that is SKX share buy back program in action. That has jumped the volume over 5 m for the day. Might see a return to upside trading tomorrow."
"If they hit $6bn of sales and get some margin leverage as both the distribution rollout and the brand matures, EPS will get towards $4 and this will be a $60+ stock. That’s a 2 year plan to 2020. This a great opportunity to buy the stock on a big discount to the sector and the market and put it away for 2 years. Imho"
"A few facts worth considering here:1. 9 day RSI is now 14, this is equal to the 5 year low reached previously in Nov 2015, from which the stock rallied 30% in 2 weeks ;2. Forward PEG ratio is now 0.7x, almost a 5 year low - it dipped briefly to 0.6x in mid 20163. Forward EV/EBITDA is now 6.5x, at the lower end of its 5 year range of 6.2 to 12x - it went briefly above and below that range in mid 2015 and late 2016;4. Forward P/E and P/E relative to the S&P are also now close to the low end of its 5 year range. SKX's P/E has ranged from 10.5x - 20x since 2013, its currently 13x. Relative to the S&P its range is 0.65x - 1.5x the S&P P/E multiple, its currently 0.79x. 5. On multiples relative to peers SHOO, COLM and DECK, its now on or through the 5 year low on P/E and EV/EBITDA. Conclusion being that based on current earnings estimates, there might be 10% further downside to the absolute trough, but we are far into the lower band of multiples now, and at trough vs. peers, and the RSI is extremely oversold = to the 5 year low."
"“And I think we all know us well and you’ve seen how we have been reshaping our portfolio to align with where we see our strengths in a larger consumer marketplace across active, outdoor and work. I would encourage you to remember those facts. And when you read things in the news that you don’t necessarily always have to believe rumors.”That's one of the least convincing denials I've ever seen and the analyst comments are very suspicious. SkX is in all those markets but their products are directed at a a different demographic and thus do not compete with VF's present brands. IMO SKX is a perfect acquisition target for VF. At the close I bought back 1/2 the shares I sold yesterday so I'm back to extremely over weighted with SKX. in case something happens this long weekend."
Should I buy? I feel like sketchers will make a comeback to the 30’s. What do you guys think?
"250% month over month direct to consumer e-commerce sales, that's what this rally is about and it will continue, among the top 3 shoe brands sold on AMZN. Skechers are cheaper and more comfortable than Nike, that's what people are looking for now."
"One thing I am seeing today, Tuesday, that I expected is much lower volume as the selling pressure continues to exhibit exhaustion behaviors. This is a process that needs to complete and appears to be in completion mode today, even though the volume still is much higher than the normal 3 m shares before the last earnings announcement. The selling started at 37 m shares, then dropped to 13 m shares, and today likely will fall well under 8 M shares, perhaps in the range between 5 and 8M shares. Then, once all the sell the news folks are out, then we still have to worry about the overall markets and the rising interest rates, but corporate profits will be assessed and other world developments will take a place in deciding what happens next. My point is that the immediate selling from the EPS guidance is ending, which provides a basis for a bottoming process and we are looking at the bottom forming now. perhaps it will dip below $29, but there are also some possible buyers now that will start to wade in and others that will start kicking the tires and looking for buy points. The entire market seems shaky right now as the main averages have dropped into possible correction mode again, and it is not clear that the rally can continue without more volatility and correction. Given the late stage of the rally it is reasonable to expect some corrections, but with earnings still looking good, I can see a rationale for any corrections to be shallow and short lived, if they develop, and it is quite possible the rally is just stalling a bit here while the institutions make up their minds about this earnings season and the inflation factors. I do think SKX is well positioned for some growth when the market permits that, given it is way oversold and his very modest valuation for a great growth story. I don't see a big slow down in the demand for shoes or the capability of consumers to buy shoes, so apparel and shoes can be a leading sector in a market down turn, IMO."
Buckingham research out with comments today saying their channel checks suggesting strong demand for SKX and support the reacceleration of top line in H2. But they also expect investments will mute margin potential this year. That's kind of what we heard from the company at Q1. The only real news here is the top line channel checks. They don't have any data on margins. So at least the top line sounds like its performing well for a strong Q3.
Today is an excellent buying opportunity. People who made money in SKX had shares at this price before they reported Q4 earnings and we saw prices $32-34...
"I now own 2 pears are Skechers shoes. I bought the first pair, memory foam, at Ross for the low cost of $37. they feel like slippers when I put them on in the morning, and they stay phone me and very comfortable all day. they have no spot that hurts any part of your foot. I was really intrigued with that pair of shoes because it's more comfortable than I used to from day one.the second pair is a performance shoe. Called ""Go Run 600"". This is a fantastic shoe, but it's not the top of the line. It lives for $60 and they give you 10% off if you have a AAA card.$54 for this shoe and it's well worth it if you run or walk. it's a substantial improvement over the memory foam but similar.I was surprised to find buying at the Skechers store that it comes in a box with a catalog of shoes. the catalog is very impressive and explains the Technologies, the different shoes that are offered in their product line and the colors and styles. it's a great catalog and very inviting. you can order online or in the store. the catalog knows more than a hundred styles and is an amazing collection of shoes. if they can get you in the store and make you purchase one pair. It's hard for me to see how you will avoid purchasing your second pair and so on.The New Concept store is extremely well laid-out and comfortable to shop in. the United States is a hyper-competitive shoe market and it will be interesting to see how Skechers does, but I think they're going to do better than previously as the New Concept stores are quite nice. if you're in Los Angeles check out the Santa Monica store on the 3rd Street Promenade."
Hmm looks like a breakout happening with volume coming in.
Anyone know why the share price has been tumbling the past few days? I haven't seen any news.
"SKX vs. NKE: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?Zacks Zacks Equity ResearchZacksAugust 13, 2019Is Matthews China Fund (MCHFX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?Investors interested in Shoes and Retail Apparel stocks are likely familiar with Skechers (SKX) and Nike (NKE). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Skechers and Nike are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SKX has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.SKX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.54, while NKE has a forward P/E of 28.12. We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 0.97. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.16.Another notable valuation metric for SKX is its P/B ratio of 2.17. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NKE has a P/B of 14.20.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SKX's Value grade of A and NKE's Value grade of F.SKX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that SKX is likely the superior value option right now."
"do you think some company like lets say Nike sees that the market is currently ""under valuing"" them and hence might take an interest to make a bid? I know all about the family and it would depend on the offer and if they are even interested in selling just thinking out loud because it seems like it would be a pretty good buy for a company like Nike"
Great shoes and great sales
All I'm looking for is $50 per share...is that asking too much?
"For the second quarter of 2019, the Company believes it will achieve sales in the range of $1.200 billion to $1.225 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.35. This guidance takes into account the impact of existing foreign exchange headwinds and the commencement of joint venture operations in Mexico. Based on current expectations, the Company anticipates that its 2019 annual tax rate will be in the range of 17 percent to 20 percent."

"Here are some other #s to suggest how ridiculously undervalued this stock is now:The share price is now back to where it was at end 2015, when it was about $30/share and on a market multiple of 15x. Since 2015 SKX Sales, EBITDA, EPS, Cash per share, Book value per share, are all UP at least 45% (2018 vs. 2015), and the S&P500 multiple has risen 10% from 15x to 16.5x. Yet SKX stock has gone nowhere, its still at $30. If the stock were merely to follow its EPS and BV/share, it should be trading at $45. Add another 10% for the S&P increase since end 2015, and it would be $50."
"With about a month to go before the start of the Q2 earnings season, there are concerns in the market about the impact of a rising U.S. dollar and slower global economic growth on companies in the S&P 500 with higher international revenue exposure. Based on current estimates, are S&P 500 companies with higher global revenue exposure expected to underperform S&P 500 companies with lower global revenue exposure in terms of earnings and sales growth for Q2 2018?The answer is no. FactSet Geographic Revenue Exposure data (based on the most recently reported fiscal year data for each company in the index) can be used to answer this question. For this particular analysis, the index was divided into two groups: companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S. (less global exposure) and companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S. (more global exposure). Aggregate earnings and revenue growth rates were then calculated based on these two groups.￼The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q2 2018 is 19.0%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the earnings growth rate is 16.5%. For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the earnings growth rate is 23.9%.The estimated sales growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q1 2018 is 8.7%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the sales growth rate is 7.4%. For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the sales growth rate is 12.5%."
"Might buy in now and hold, nice pennant today breakout to the upside and keep on going!"
Standpoint Research upgraded to BUY from HOLD.
I think someone believes that SKX had a nice turn around from Covid this Q. Calls are carrying a heave premium too - if this thing keeps driving higher I much sell some at-the-money calls for a little extra $$ and provide some protection.
Everyone buying into earnings
"Last miss, and the AH selling was over 41 M shares. They are doing very well growing the sales internationally, which is their main goal, to build the brand, but market gives no credit when they miss guidance. Good growth in cash, and executing on share buybacks. I think they should step up buying back stock at these prices. Still growing faster than NKE."
deathly afraid of tomorrow. think a turnaround in order and stock very undervalued but management is accident prone and not shareholder friendly. dont want to lose my profits. really nervous about holding through earnings
Fantastic ER and they still have many stores shutdown (mostly in Europe). Well played SKX!
"Look. At. This. Balance. Sheet! A company worth 3.9B with $900m in cash and short term investments. SKX is doing exactly what other companies aren't - building cash for troubling times like this. at $24.xx, what a deal!"
"I am so frustrated owning this stock and took a bath on shares of SKX a couple of years ago. I love their product and wore SKX exclusively for many years. I developed a foot problem at some point requiring me to move to New Balance and removable inserts, but still wear my SKX as my problem has resolved. I always loved their style, comfort and price and they always had a great selection of work/dressy shoes that were super comfy. If you look around the web you see nothing but positive reviews of their stores and shoes (with running and golf shoes getting high praise). Was out at a large museum in L.A. and, while NKE were the prevalent brand, definitely noticed older folks and tourists (primarily Asian) were wearing SKX. The company appears well managed with a rock solid balance sheet, no debt and impressive growth. However, it is not considered the ""cool"" brand so it gets no respect and no premium (trading at 1X sales) while every other company in the market drowning in debt, negative FCF, fractions of SKX revenue, etc. etc. go higher and higher and get assigned insane valuations. I am deathly afraid now of owning SKX through earnings since any minor hiccup or extra money spent on achieving growth will be seen as a negative and the stock will be punished. Sadly, management seems totally uninterested in promoting their company or stock in between ER reports. Too bad Oprah or Willy Wonka Musk and his cars made in tents are not our CEO or we would be trading at 85 now.."
"First-quarter sales increased 16.5% to $1.25 billion, which marks a new quarterly sales record, a result of the growth we achieved across three distribution channels, domestic wholesale, international wholesale, and our global company-owned Skechers retail stores. This is a testament to the worldwide strength and relevance of our brand.First-quarter highlights include a new quarterly sales record; an 8.5% sales gain in our domestic wholesale business, with an increase of 15.1% in pairs shipped; a 17.9% sales increase in our international wholesale business, primarily due to our subsidiary and joint venture countries; a 26.4% sales increase in our global company-owned retail stores, with comp-store sales increasing 9.5% globally."
The The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation now owns 7.3 Million shares as of today's SG13 filing that was probably the big move last week. They acquired 5.4% of the company. Lets go SKX!
"Cramer said he favors NKE over SKX...gee....over the last month I've had a 14 percent return with SKX while NKE has gone nowhere. SKX is a value company right now. I like both SKX and NKE and own both, but there is no question SKX trades more on fundamentals right now than NKE. I expect a big return in this name over the long haul. Rates rising makes value names like SKX a smart investment."
"I sure hope we test $30 again today. if skx pushes through $30, 35 should follow soon."

"Finally, some serious movement!"
This is actually a solid co. with a very good brand. Long term investors will do very good with SKX.
"Good article on Shechers in the Wall Street Journal; a few copy and paste comments below.The decidedly uncool footwear company’s shares produced a total return of 836% from 2012 to 2017. That was 3½, 4½ and 14 times the performance of Adidas , Nike and Under Armour , respectively.Skechers won a devoted following by focusing more on comfort and less on style and glitz. In the U.S., it is the top brand for walking, work shoes and women’s casual lifestyle shoes. It also traditionally has done well with children, though not teens, and its shoes are thought of as offering good value for money.Now my comments, bought 3 pair yesterday, the most comfortable shoes I ever put on my feet. I'm 69 and noticed some of their people that advertise for them on TV are older guys like me, Howie Long for one, Matt Kucher another. The shoes are light and look great! Check them out, also had plenty of wide fit for the older guys.Long and strong, good luck to all!"
Over $100 million for buybacks and yet no announcement.
Any news ?
"Cramer lightening round on SKX yesterday...""Well, the last quarter was quite bad. I'd like to see the boys come back on and give us a little sense of what's happening because otherwise, I'm not venturing into that one.""The last quarter was a record! The Q2 outlook was softer than the sell side expected but was mostly because of some orders shifted to Q3 and higher investment spending on GROWTH! You have to buy these stocks when others have panicked, Cramer saying he'll only buy again when its clear everything is great just means he'll pay over $40 for it rather than $29."
I believe this earnings due in july will be the game changer...expecting a beat and great forecast for Q3...could easily get a $10 pop...go look at the pop in the 4thQ of last year....nice pop..would not be surprised to get that kind of action...economy is strong....retail doing well....SKX is like a coiled spring..any beat will bring on the upgrades.
why is there such a bias against SKX in the market? it seems a solid financially sound company with virtually no debt. and now china is on the upswing ...
"1.4 million shares repurchased this quarter with $92 million still available for further share repurchase. Almost 2 million shares purchased in 9 months this year. That means at current numbers, another 3.4 million shares could be repurchased. That will be almost 3.5% of all total shares repurchased this year if total diluted shares of 156,298,000 figure is used. That's meaningful using any metric. Company is growing sales and profits, and opening new market channels throughout the world. What's not to like? This deserves a higher multiple! Glta Bill"
Remember 3 day rule...look at chart after last miss...stock dropped...and then again next few days...
$28.69 is support and if the stock closes below this level then it is technically in a breakdown with no support below.
"SKX stock is for long-term holders, who can stomach volatility. The stock has been incredibly cheap and has great intrinsic value. Once SKX strategy switches from fast international sales growth to cash flow optimization, SKX will be north of $80/ share. Just be patient and give it a couple of years... actually, if you compare the SKX Price/Sales ratio to Nike's and look to SKX Sales growth vs SKX Earnings growth vs SKX Stock price performance in the last 5 years, you can taste some of the hidden value in this stock..."
Patience will be rewarded
nice :)
"After two rally attempts were turned back at $28.45, the final hour sell off in the broad market carried SKX to another loss. However, selling did continue to moderate, and most of the day traded in positive territory. Despite the closing selloff, aspects of today's trading were encouraging. I look forward to better days for the longs from here."
Buyout???
FL is up $7 on earnings. The footwear group is doing well again. SKX is being pulled up with them. Going to take a run at $31 today?
"SKX is a high quality company with so much going for it. Plenty of cash, good revenue and earnings, room left on stock repurchase etc. With tech out of favor and retail showing some signs of strength this is one to own. Wouldn't be surprised if this gets taken out at $35 in the not so far future.FWIW Pete Najarian had some positive things to say about the stock yesterday."
"Todays retest of $30 is the 4th time, and bodes well for SKX. Again the shoe stocks are generally doing well, in a down market, and this is continued rotation into apparel and footwear that will ultimately help drive SKX's pps recovery. IMO"
blew away earnings...why down?
Do you think we will recover some $$$ tomorrow?
Open tomorrow 27.50..
What a bargain price for great company! loading up tomorrow..34 and change...
"Lots of positive things I see here in Europe that US investors and analysts probably don’t .... 1. Definitely more brand awareness and advertising on UK TV and also continental Europe channels for SKX than the last few years. 2. Price points here compared to US are a bit higher across the SKX range and comparable to adidas and Nike. For example a pair of men’s trainers are up to 80usd a pair here. Suggests that the brand is well liked and pricing ok. Helps the gross margin as they grow overseas. 3. Stores I’ve been in have much more store space allocated to SKX vs. even a year ago, sometimes 50% more inventory for sale - this is not stuff that is unsold , just more store allocation than before. This sort of expansion requires time and money and personally I think SKX has been doing a good job in what is a tough market to take share in. I believe they see a long term secular trend for their style of product and are pushing the growth button hard now in Europe and Asia especially. Surprised that US investors and analysts don’t understand this better, they should travel and see what’s going on over here"

"SKX was over $51/share back in August 2015. From then to now... the balance sheet and cash is significantly better, the sales is significantly higher, the product is more proven to be a lasting product then a fad, growth in China is ramping up higher... there's no reason why it would be valued at less than $51/share today if it was worth that back then. I think 1 or 2 more quarters of very solid results and we're over $50."
"On Sunday, I visited the Skechers new concept store in the Santa Monica 3rd Street Promenade, and I mentioned that I purchased several items, one of which is their Go Run 600 shoe, which is a good one but not the top of their line. So, I have tried it out now, both walking and running. Very, very comfortable for 4 mile distances. It really is light, and it feels like you are in your bare feet with a padding of bouncy foam that is just right. What absolutely amazed me, is that my right knee did not suffer from its usual pain where I had a minus tear operation. I have been wearing New Balance shoes since the 1980s for running (the 990s and 993s), and they are great, but these new Go Runs are a later technology and felt much better for me. If you have not tried them for running, I strongly recommend you try them on and see what you think. They work for me and I am switching from New Balance."
lets see $35 T OPEN
Chunky athletic shoes are the hippest things going - Skechers is going to surprise waaaaaay on the upside.
"This stock always overreacts to the downside on any miss, no matter the amount of the miss or what the guidance is. Another buying opportunity."
"My prediction: $29.11 = BottomYesterday's volume as stock fell 27% = 37.1M sharesToday's estimated volume as stock drops another (ridiculous 4.3%) =12 MTomorrow selling on the quarterly guidance will be exhausted, IMODon't forget that Management guided to up to $.43 for 2nd quarter which was only $.10 off consensus! $.10 in projected income has resulted in 30% of the company value!!1One of the reasons for the drop in projected income was an increase in SGA expenses to support foreign growth. They have been spending on growth and delivering growth for over 5 years. That money is likely to be well spent even if it dented 2nd quarter projected profits. Another reason for the drop in projected profits was some sales displacement. Not a big deal, but the PPS has been really sold hard for two days. Best prices are today and tomorrow, IMO. I keep thinking that the S&P500 projected earnings are going to come in with a huge growth due partly to the tax changes and this is going to keep the markets from falling. SKS will benefit from a good earnings climate, and this is still a great growth story with good prospects. An independent growth factor for SKX is that the world population is climbing, so shoe demand has a built in growth factor in good and bad markets."
Did I hear that correctly - $150M share repurchase?
"Did a search for Skechers skateboard shoes. All results were on shopping sites etc. indicating that that is not a current product. I also did a skateboard shoe search on Sketchers website and all that comes up is all their GO GOLF products A search of Vans website for golf give no Vans golf products. Even though the page existsPut that together with this:And I think we all know us well and you’ve seen how we have been reshaping our portfolio to align with where we see our strengths in a larger consumer marketplace across active, outdoor and work. I would encourage you to remember those facts. And when you read things in the news that you don’t necessarily always have to believe rumors.”Seems to me to be a clue that the two companies are going to become one."
"Risk reward going into #s on the 19th is undoubtedly good. The stock has been a very big underperformer. If they beat and guide for a strong Q3 of growth and margins, then this will go to $40+ very quickly imho. If they are so so #s, then we probably have downside back towards the $27-28 level. Analyst estimates were dialed back already about 6-7% after Q1, so there should be much less EPS risk from Q2 onwards. And the P/E multiple is already at or close to all time lows vs. the peer group. The de-rate has already happened after the Q1 #s. I see 10% or so downside vs. 30%+ upside from the Q2 release which i feel is very good odds."
Someone explain to me the drop in after hours trading PRIOR to earnings release information being available??
Another price target increase:Skechers USA (SKX) PT Raised to $46 at Susquehanna on NY Shoe Show & Black Friday Weekend Store Checks
"I thought the results actually looked great. If estimates were missed I would say whoever came up with the estimates got it wrong, not the company. As I noted below recently returned from Italy. Everyone is wearing Skechers there."
This is a bad overreaction.

"With that excellent ER, this should be over $30 right now."
their shoes are nice tho... very comfortable and 2-3 times cheaper than the big brands..
Got in at 29.97!
Clearly a program seller at 30.50 needs to be cleared out
is the sky falling??
"Wrong. They got skewered again for nothing really. If I had the numbers they produced, I'd be beaming. Sure - there are opportunities to improve, but otherwise, great product, great growth story and more to come."
does anyone have any idea how the earnings report is going to come out after closing bell
"Market is off to a good start on Thursday and SKX is trying to launch another attack on $30, which is purely a psychological round number resistance point. There can't be much supply, IMO, so I am expecting it will break through $30 and keep going at some point. IMO, this is an oversold and undervalued stock when you check the fundamentals and the psychology that caused all the selling is bogus fear. Once the fear subsides and the bargain hunters see it is not going down, most value and growth players should consider SKX a solid pick, IMO. It seems obvious to me, but the technical damage of a stock that was crushed still is holding it back and that is the real problem that needs to be overcome. It is know as overhead resistance."
"i'm holding until at least 2020 anyway and i'm not selling this stock for less than $60, i don't care whether it goes up or down today or tomorrow. By 2020 we will see the true power of their International investments and if i'm right and they can get close to $6bn of sales and see some operating leverage as investment in growth slows at that point, then EPS will be approaching $4 and they will have bought back 5-10% of the stock by then...hence why $60/share minimum by sometime in 2020 is the least i'm willing to accept. If people want to panic sell now because of Q2 guidance then so be it."
that was fun. but in true SKX fashion it will fail to hold any significant gains.
"I see the ambulance chasers are at it again... business is slow they could care less about us stockholders. Frivolous, assign them court cost !"

"Between a huge Singles Day where we know SKX did very well, and Black Friday where we know in general retailers did very well, Q4 is shaping up to be a very nice beat."
I have a question for the more astute investors on this board like end2war....will the strength of the dollar hurt the numbers? international growth strong but those currencies are weak against the dollar. TIA
nice bounce back.
"Jeezus, can't this POS have a single up day? Every other overpriced, money losing FOMO tech stock marches ever higher (SHOP is closing in on a 2000x/pe?!) and SKX cannot get any traction. I wish someone would just buy them out and go private since the market clearly does not care about a profitable, growing, simple business model with great balance sheet and worldwide distribution network. Nope, better to chase Virgin Galactic with its whopping 2 million ""revenue"" but the same market cap practically as SKX."
Buy heavy on any Cramer Dip that we get from his Lightning Round comments. Everything looking up for this stock and company including Amazon reviews of the golf shoe line. This high margin product is being very well received and will help drive a surprise on the next earnings release. It’s a $38 stock at this point and will migrate that way slowly into the next earnings call. GLTA
Is everyone drunk? This strong growth stock is down 27% on a fairly small glitch.
I am hoping skx can finish over $30 today.
No need to be alarmed folks...this is merely profit taking after a huge run. SKX will be back in the 50s later this week. We still have a lot more upside from here...SKX worldwide is still operating at a fraction of its full capacity. Once stores in Europe reopen we are talking a huge move to the upside. No fear on dips.
"According to my algorhytyms and projections this baby will be over 300 by the end of the year. Think about all the people who can't take Uber now because of Corona. They all have to walk. Sketchers makes the best walking shoes and will not be able to meet demand. People who normally deliver in Ubers need good walking shoes too. Short Uber, long Sketchers. I always have to trust my algorhytym models."
Does anyone know why SKX stock is up so sharply this morning (March 15) whereby it is up over $2 to $41+?
"The valuation multiples for SKX are ridiculously low vs peers now. 2019 EV/EBIT of 7x, PE of 11x. For a stock that is the fastest growing in the sector. Compared to many others on a 50% premium. Macquarie reiterates buy today , $45 target."
"Really nice to see SKX mentioned today on CNBC as one of the top sellers and beneficiaries of Singles Day. Does anyone have any sources where details of how much was sold or what this might mean to the company? This would be a great time for management to go on Bloomberg or CNBC and brag a little bit, and provide some more detail. GLTA Bill"
Up-Grades coming!! Home run!! EPS looks like .07 cent beat!!!
"One of the issues that has been raised is SKX's plans to add 450 stores, in an age where sales by internet are on the rise. But, IMO, this is a very good strategy for SKX because, first, their year over year results showed same store sales improvements, if I recall correctly, of 6% so that is accretive to sales and profits. What critics of this strategy don't seem to take into account that shoe sales are very dependant on fit and providing more places for customers to try the shoes on is an overall positive both for the retail store sales and for follow on internet sales. If they can lay out attractive stores, they can also expand sales into accessories and apparel, which is what their stores are doing. This is part of a growth strategy that helps the public become more and more aware of the SKX offerings which are key to continued success with growing sales. I personally think they know what they are doing, and it will pay off."
"Market down big with Dow off nearly 2% while SKX is unchanged and volume is crawling compared to past two days. You can really see the selling is exhausted here. When the market doom and gloom lets up, SKX is set up to see net positive demand and it should find some higher ground IMO. Best days to buy probably are yesterday and today."
This will rise to $28 and then hover around there until significant news breaks or the next earnings call.
"I suspect that SKX management was very surprised at the violent down action on the PPS resulting from their guidance. Personally, I thought it resulted from two items, increased costs that cut projected profits, and some order displacements to the third quarter that raised an issue over how long the growth rate may be lower.The analysts played a big part in the PPS fall, and I think they are all manipulators. They are able to spin whatever they want to move the stock PPS which they have done. There may have been some shorting to help push the PPS down in afterhours after the eps report.But it is obvious that SKX has been a growth machine for more than 5 years. The growth numbers are huge and they don't lie. Any company that wants to sustain growth at some times outlives its existing infrastructure and that means they must spend more to push to the next level. That is clearly what is going on as SKX tries to take advantage of its growing position in the foreign territories, especially China. I think the balance sheet looks great ($700 M in cash) and this is a good time to invest in their growth. While the cost to keep growing is playing a part in lowering the estimated profits for next quarter by 10 to 15 cents, I don't think that should have been cause for the wholesale selling, and in fact it is cause for cautious optimism. Gross margins in the first quarter actually were growing and once the costs are spread over the anticipated growth, they will have the leverage that they need, assuming they know what to do to attain growth, which we have seen they do know. It is very hard for me to see a rational from one quarter of guidance that they are spending to maintain growth that the stock should be clobbered by a 33% PPs haircut. That is plain ridiculous IMO and is the result of manipulations by the market by those that are buying in on this drop.As to the deferral of sales to the third quarter, that is yet to be seen, but in the first quarter their sales were very good to great, with a beat and nice continued growth. Until you get to the guidance part, the report should have sent the PPS to $45, not $29. This company is not extended on PE, nor is it overpriced by any sense IMO. If they beat their guidance for the 2nd quarter or even come in at the high end, that will do a lot to show they know what they are doing. By the time everything plays out, if their brand is strengthened in the foreign arena, we could be looking at a $50 stock. Right now, we are looking at a great performer in the apparel space that is worth $40 selling for under $30, IMO. Look for recovery back into the $34 to $38 range by the next quarterly report, IMO.This stock is under valued because it is being pushed around by institutional action, some are selling but others are buying. Which ones are the smart money, LOL.Please do your own due diligence, and don't every rely on a poster."
Company is flat out bargain! Just went from c rating hold at Schwab to A strong buy. Trading at 1-1 sales to market value. Love this CHEAP!!
"Tax cuts are now passed, what does this company have in store for its loyal shareholders and over $800,000,000 in cash?"
Growth company with a broken stock price..... guaranteed bounce coming..... (1) Count how many people around you are wearing Skechers (2) Try on a pair with the Memory foam insoles to feel the comfort (3) See the high traffic of customers in your local Skechers store (4) see how they differentiate for each age and category (5) go to China or Brazil and see the major brand presence

Very nice 50% move on SKX and nobody on the board talking... hidden gem. Congrats to the longs!
"The market cap is now 3.1 billion and they have 844 million in cash. They just got done spending about 400 million on stock, average price of $30, with 100 million to go. This is a bear raid, just like they did to WHR a few weeks ago."
"The CEO comments left this issue about the buy-out as open ended with a weak denial statement. He did not say for sure it was ""NO"" and mentioned they would or could pursue acquisitions for more growth. I think the Buying of SKX would benefit both companies. SKX is a strong brand and making head way in the ""Golf World"" with no debt and almost one billion in cash on balance sheet. With VFC marketing muscle and their position in the retail world this would be great for both companies!!!"

Skechers Wins Best Brand of the Year in Germany.
The books look really good here. Perhaps we can get back over $40!!!
Optimistic for tomorrow. If it does another 3% percent in the first 30 minutes its gonna be a good day.
"Looks like the US is going to reduce its demands and make some compromise proposal to China, which should help the sentiment on companies with significant positions in China. If progress is made that should help SKX sentiment, IMO.

"SKX is on the cusp of hitting a home run.....retail doing great....SKX stated the reason for the ""slight"" dissappointment in the 2nd Q forecast was the orders for some companied had been pushed back to 2nd half of the year so the market drops SKX from $42 to $29...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! SKX will beat and give good guidence...watch for the $10 pop"
Price Target raised to $45 at Citi.
Thank You End2War for your posts.
Just bought in today for first time
"Wow, and like that I'm back in the red with SKX. I thought the company had some good momentum with the last 2 quarters and Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser gave them a bump up a few weeks back noting business was picking up. I'm leaving it on the back burner and definitely not selling for a while, but one day I'm exiting for good."
"Big drop in April after earnings report, tomorrow will be a good day!!!SKX will finally gain traction and keep climbing......."
"From the 4/19 high to the 5/4 low, SKX lost over $15 (or an astounding 36%) after posting its best quarter ever, and after 5 solid years of very good growth. While I can't say for sure which way it is going next, I have a pretty good hunch that its sales and earnings growth will continue."
Buy at $32.1
"guidance was bad, blowout earnings won't matter"
"Hard to argue with the facts and numbers on this one. And even more powerful - I checked my doorstep and didn't even realize it but my kids have a total of 4 pairs of Skechers, my wife has two and I have one (and soon to be more). When I walked my kid to the bus stop yesterday, 3 out of 4 kids had on Skechers and one of the parents. Sold on Amazon and Alibaba. Good enough for me - I'm in..."
"$40 stock, patience is the key"
For one second when I was checking the Yahoo quote it said up $20 to $46 a share maybe that's our buyout point!
back up to 30 by tomorrow 
So I'm expecting a rebound to mid $30's next week....then expect it to flat line for a bit.
Started a position at 24.50 about 20 mins ago. GLTA
Finally some positive movement
Great earning results and very positive market reaction so far.Analysts are still cautious. It means more room for further upgrades.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/skechers-stock-rockets-16-premarket-as-analysts-weigh-in-on-earnings-2019-02-08
Great time to buy!
would love to see an earnings blowout with great forecast and stock pops $10
"record sales Q1 market is unbelievable, guidance was obviously lowered on purpose"
thanks for the great post Logan.....I do think this earnings will be the game changer for the stock price.
"If that China interview is correct, the growth rate coming out of China still for SKX is at 50%+ and currently even faster at nearly 80% through its direct E-commerce business. And that overall 50%+ growth rate is on a big business too, one that’s doing over $750mn of sales. That growth rate is faster than any other large shoe manufacturer , including Nike. That is staggering for a stock on 11x p/e, and imho shows the current undervaluation of SKX’s Asian franchise in particular. Especially as the other regions are growing mid to high single digit still."
I just returned from a cruise on Crown Princess and found that they had a lot of Sketchers shoes for sale. The entire lot was sold out before I got off the ship. Pretty impressed with the demand.
