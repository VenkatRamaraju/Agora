Don't you love this stock... I have had it for several years now and the CEO is wonderful.... The money I have made is wonderful too...:-)
anyone knows why CRM share price is up but call option is down so much?
Buy buy buy!!!!
My investment in stocks and crypto are really doing well especially crypto despite the fluctuations in the current price 
This is a great company and they will grow the business. But how can this stock and the market in general go up when we have a government that is bent on taxing us to death in order to build a communist country.
"Marc Benioff sold over 10,000,000 shares last week. That’s over 1/3 of his owned shares. Anyone else see a potential drop in share price next week starting 10/4?"
"Q2 Adj. EPS $1.48 Beats $0.92 Estimate, Sales $6.34B Beat $6.24B Estimate"
"the CEO always is selling his stock as soon as it goes out check it out on market watch ,therefore i will not invest in it!"
How high will this jump tomorrow?
Funds looking closer to 7 not 6 Billion. stock future up in the air.
"You can't fight poverty by just printing more fiat into the circulation. If you mean well for the people, embrace a transparent financial system."
I'm loving this.
"Holding my CRM shares until we break $300!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!see ACRX is breaking-out, now up 8%; look at the ACRX 5-day chart!"
"The last 9 reactions on this CRM board are ads for ""worlds greatest stock picks."" Go away ads people. Go CRM. Benioff has the golden touch. Glad we have him."
Our own corporation looks at CRM this way. They spend half a billion on social issues which translates to over-priced products and excessive wages for it's employees. We went elsewhere for our business need and saved a fortune. The results for us were fantastic.
R-E-S-P-E-C-TThis is way overdue.
"Salesforce UPGRADED to Overweight from Neutral with a $365 price target (from $280) at Piper SandlerPiper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin upgraded Salesforce (CRM) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $365, up from $280. The analyst says in-person conversations with new leadership over the last two days give him confidence that Salesforce should see a ""multi-year period of multiple and profit expansion tied to operating discipline and organic investments that can sustain growth."" Despite the 7% rally after the fiscal 2023 guide up yesterday, Salesforce has an estimated 2023 enterprise value to sales ratio of 7.5 times versus Microsoft (MSFT) at 9.3 times and Adobe (ADBE) at 14 times, in part because it has emphasized growth over margins for the past decade, says the analyst. Bracelin believes the company's new team, new model, and new post-Covid reality point to a ""structural change"" that could result in a material boost to profits as it scales revenue to $50B-plus."
$WIMI $CRM holding strong.I see this go over 100$ in next 3 to 5 years.$TWTR
BEARS MAD
"CRM has been consolidating for the better part of a year...the longer the sleep, the greater the fireworks. Looks like resistance at 272 is going to be broken when the market opens, and the old high of 282 could be surpassed by the close."
Good luck all.
Looking forward to a red opening tomorrow
"Breaking, New price targetsSalesforce price target raised to $350 from $335 at Goldman SachsSalesforce price target raised to $340 from $280 at Raymond JamesSalesforce UPGRADED to Outperform from Neutral with a $330 price target at KGI SecuritiesSalesforce price target raised to $320 from $291 at BarclaysSalesforce price target raised to $315 from $295 at StifelSalesforce price target raised to $310 from $250 at JPMorganSalesforce price target raised to $305 from $285 at Morgan Stanley"
GOOD GUIDANCE AS WELL. IT WILL REACH TO 300 SOON !!
$WIMI $CRM $NKLA here’s the deal we need a deal haha
"Well all those months of pain - and finally others recognize what we saw , despite the Slack acquisition which was to blunt MSFT teams and dynamics"
Recently they had great earnings and I feel their future is very bright. I am buying on the recent pullback over the past few weeks.
"UP, UP, AND AWAY!!! CRM reports strong 2nd quarter earnings!!! CRM will reach $ 275.00 tomorrow!!! GO CRM GO!!!"
It's peaked.
"Sell this and buy BILL, which is growing like no tomorrow. I see $320-350 on that."
Appears may have gotten lucky. Sold at $268.00 A/H. That never happens---
Pretty simple......investors think MB is a BS'er. He would make a better Santa Claus at the local mall that he does the CEO of CRM. He isn't going to have to change much. He can be put a raised fist patch on his suit and be social justice warrior and Santa Claus at the same time
This is now a 300 dollar stock for next ER
$CRM keep in mind they officially closed the Slack deal this quarter. Could be great catalyst with positive updates.
"now I like this CEO. He spoke up for weak, (nothing ""woke"" about it). Going put 1 million in this :)"
What does this company even do ? LoLI've never used it LoL
"Make sure to give your best each and every day - on the long run, it will certainly pay off! $CRM $VENA"
"Come-on guys,we can close above $280"
"Holding for 305. CRM surpassing 300 is like the Cowboys winning another Superbowl in the 1990's. Not if, but when."
"GUIDANCES BEING RAISED IN 3, 2, …."
up we go
This is overvalued i feel. But wont ever short it lol
"Wow. Just when this stock had legs to run. This happened. Like was said, WS does not like new products and news from CRM. Bell weather company ."
easily $400
Next MSFT in 5 years
Longs waiting for Uncle to see the new guidance.
"Expansion, guidence , CNBC crowing about, analysts jumping in bullish, , interview with Cramer coming up...I wish u guys ( and girls) could see my grin as I pour another glass of champagne."
"Just because Marc sold some shares should not matter, and an analyst pegging the shares at 265 is not cause for alarm. The long term catalysts are firmly in place. Don't get spooked by short term profit takers."
"Yesterday's candle is bearish but weekly candle is forming bullish, RSI and Stochastic turning hot. It may require a week or two to consolidate then it will continue its north bound movement. Holding."
just deleted my stop loss order...
yikes ceo thinks he can pay to change the laws
"Getting accurate estimates is impossible. Yahoo Finance has CRM earning .91 per share on 6.24 billion, Think or Swim has them earning .92 per share on Revenue 6.24 Billion, and Seeking Alpha has them earning .93 per share on 6.25 Billion. Where do these estimates come from? To me if these estimates are based on analysts expectations they all should be the same, yet they NEVER are. How do you know which one is actually right???"
"man, this baby going to 300 by Christmas....rough ride (from 280, joining to Dow last year down to 200 at beginning of this year!) So far happy to add more on this bumpy ride."
What do investors have against CRM ? This stock should have gained 10% after earnings. Can’t understand
In case you were under a rock this week - new high and up $25. I’ll be happy with $5 next week and hope doesn’t give too much back as it gets there .
CRM has won back investor's confidence on buying Slack. The stock price should go up and over $280 soon. This is the only big high tech company left behind during the pandemic time because of buying Slack. Don't miss this investment opportunity. Good luck!
Bank of Am raised PT from $320 to $330
"perfect stock if interest rates rise!!! positive cash flow, great future growth with Slack!! this stock is a no brainer"
Last minute shoppers are coming in right before ER announcement. Think some may have been tipped off? lmao
"$KPLT short % hit 26%. The shorts are stagnating, fewer are entering into this stock. They are hoping for a loss in the lawsuits for Katapult which won’t happen. These lawsuits are normal for new stocks with volatile price action. Nothing to worry about. The potential for this company is huge. Big companies like $CRM & $ADBE are not fools to collaborate with a failing company. They know Katapults worth and so should you!Hold and see this fly high."
I'm out. I can't hold shares in a company which supports infanticide. Has the CEO absolutely no conscience?
"CRM management intentionally pumps the stock price, my guess is that they are preparing for next merger. Buying WORK has been approved to be successful not only good for business but also regaining confidence from shareholders in management's capability of leading the company. This stock is one of the best in the big tech group with significant potential to move up. $300 is the next target price, and it will be reached by the end of this year."
"Im afraid we need a good beat today, expectations are skyhigh for ER after close today, but i believe"
healthy pullback. $300 in no time
I am sure it has massive upside and is an outstanding long term play.$WIMI $SHOP $CRM

"Salesforce price target raised to $320 from $282 at JMP SecuritiesJMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $320 from $282 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its Q2 earnings next week. The analyst notes that channel checks on the company's quarter have been mostly positive, with the highlights that included a ""large ten-figure deal"" with a networking company along with ""commentary around big deals in general""."
"This won’t stop until $330 at least, let’s continue the party next week, happy weekend all."
"The questions around abortion is a debate belonging to individuals, their Doctors, and their God. Nowhere does it belong to a pompous CEO who dares not only to comment but put Corporate profits on one side of this argument. As a shareholder, I do not want a company leadership to spend time on political activism. I have posted before about MB activist mindset, but this is the last straw for me.....helping people move out of a state like Texas......and of course that adds to another day of decline.As an investor, MB needs to show me where in the company Prospectus or P&L is the line for spend on abortion rights. Maybe MB should pay this out of his own pocket and NOT the company purse. As I end, I am so disgusted, I just placed a sell order for all my 500 shares...............I AM DONE!"

"CRM is kicking Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP"
wow!!! 400$ by eoy crushed earnings!
"If this stock was realistically trading at what a typical valuation on a similar company....it would be at $100 or less. Stocks like this are piled into by wall street elite as a safe haven....they then keep each others positions propped up. Similar stocks include AMD, NVDA, TSLA, TWLO, etc....In my humble view."
Most upsetting stock I have ever owned.

My wife just informed me...no s*x for 2 weeks because I did not buy more CRM in March...
"CRM has lot of room to move up as it had been range bound for almost a year. Good earnings, good guidance, Slack deal is done, have to catch with rest of the market which has been up a lot."
"This looks like a pump again by Benioff and his team to buy few more companies to keep that 20% growth streak going. If stock fails to break above that 280 level it set last year, then watch out below for that double top"
Solid report. No weakness.
CRM will go down faster than I do tomorrow.

"@uncle have an avg of 44%/yr return over last 7 years for total of 327% why are you so negative on this company? Did you sell early, or never buy?"
"Big beat baby. Not selling this for a very, very long time"
"This is RIDICULOUS, another down day for CRM, I am convinced this is not going anywhere. I am losing confidence that CRM is a long term holding in my portfolio, it is becoming more transparent CRM is dead money. No confidence in Benioff, no confidence in strategy, no confidence in growth, no confidence in smart acquisitions. Considering CRM looks to be an anchor in my portfolio and I have better places to invest and while I hold CRM, this dog is losing me money. WHY did I not sell when was nearing $275! If next week this does not rebound, I'll take my profits and leave CRM to the more hopeful."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"

An earning surprise should take $OKTA upwards just like $CRM did. I can easily see $300 with the recent momentum.
$275 at least this week
You should buy this before earnings this evening. If you dont believe check there financials. Aslo get in cyber security when it dips. Your welcome!!
Well..the silver lining (if there is one) is that traditionally CRM has fallen for several days after earnings ...this time being no different. The negative is that when this has happened in the recent past the market was in better shape and not so nervous.
"If the CEO wants to go play Abortion Warrior, then he should leave and go to work for Planned Parenthood. When a woman kills an unborn child that is a killing. Period. Whether the killing is legal is for somebody else to deternine. I am out."
"Latest upgrade should drive CRM above $280 before ER next week. And depending on the ER results and no Benioff surprises (like prior reports), CRM will finally start making new highs and get to valuations commensurate with CRM potential based on all the investments made over the years.I Hope Benioff allows the integration of acquisitions begin to work and produce for the company. And I hope Benioff does not throw another curveball about another acquisition. Heard on CNBC this morning when Cramer mentioned ""exciting change"" to be announced by CRM....don't know how to parse that statement."
Invest in this stock by Tom and pick up this dip? What’s your thoughts on this stock will it go over 290$ by Tom when the earnings come out?
We are heading there guys!! Just need that boost from the ER next week and we are all good! In Benioff we trust
Shorting again !
275 to 267 is the wrong direction.

"W/O question this company is selling at a premium. She stumbles, could easily drop $40.00."
Selling or holding?
Nice beat on CRM.  DON’T FORGET ABOUT DOCN (DIGITAL OCEAN) too!
"rsi is way overbought. Every time this happens above 70 with this stock in the last few years, it comes down. This will be no different along with the fact that there's now a gap to fill. And unless the the SPX clears 4500 in the near terms, the bears are in charge and we're going to 4200-4270 region before we take out new highs."
"We see quite a bit of price swings yesterday and today. Obviously you had the ER, and the Fed meeting as major drivers. But today's pricing action does seem unusual... up until you view the opex for today.Looking at where the open interest resides, and you see a perfect definition of MAX PAIN. It's unfortunate (IMO) the growth of derivatives has such an impact on short term pricing action. And that is why I only invest long term now. If you don't understand what I'm talking about do yourself a favor and you'll actually learn something unlike 95% + of the posts here."
Raised guidance by 50 million? Did I read that correct ?? Wow the stock acting like it was much higher
Who made money off of CRM today? 
Trailing pe of 111 and 63pe on next years est. More risk than reward.
its about time u fly. Have been waiting for the longest time. $CRM $VENA
At whose expense will he transport these women to other states to get the abortions? His or his shareholders. I choose to not pay for it.
$CRM $WIMI pretty important breakout here.will this continue up or start pullback?? $NFLX
Why does Wall St love crm? I am sure it is not because they pay so much to investment bankers for all their acquisition activity. All want a share of these fees.
"Does anyone know if this will continue? Would love to buy 200 and sell around $325. Would I be safe doing it? Thanks, this is unreal!"
$CRM Looking for 300 before 320. Pump pump!
Buy now before earning report?
where the haters? *Cue Benioff laughter*
Time to start Shorting CRM. D bag ceo is getting company involved in politics / abortion controversy. Not good. I am playing for big downside.
Taking off to $300
Interesting take prior to earnings.https://youtu.be/4dZOTAZS68Y
I read all the customer reviews online for this quarter. Let just say I have a stop loss just in case.
LOOKS LIKE a VERY GREEN SEPTEMBER APPROACHING...$$
"Going to 280 by EOD tomorrow. They crushed it, as usual. What a fantastic collaboration platform, blows away MSFT Dynamics by 10,000 miles."
$CRM $VENA can walk away from the market forever. higher and I can retire.
Congrats longs. Glad i bought back in below 220 and let crm ride.
I repeat not more than $145.
Forming the perfect cup and handle!!
$INTC tomorrow's job # will be huge gap up for all stocks.$WIMI $CRM
I might be one of the few that doesn't give a @#$% about abortion debates. What I DO care about is a stock's value. CRM is a fine company whose stock price is just way too high. Wait to buy lower.
PT increase tomorrow to 350.
Back to $245 support. Nothing changed !!
$190 support
Don't you love this stock. I have owned it for two years and I think the CEO is great.
New all-time @ 287+ pre-market.
Large Class action lawsuit coming soon. CEO pumped then dumped. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000112760221025894/xslF345X03/form4.xml
I would be BENIOFF without CRM in my portfolio............LOL! If this is not $280 by next ER and $300 by YE.....I am out and moving on.
CEO set a pump trap.
Owning CRM is like watching paint dry or grass grow! Do we finally hit $280 going into ER in a couple weeks? I believe so as Slack acquisition should be absorbed by most investors.
Growth is accelerating
JPM shills out making a trade for itself and clients before earnings with a price target hike so they can dump some shares into retail baggies
"Time to face reality. IF CRM isn't going to make a move towards $300 esp after the last few quarterly reports it likely isn't. My guess is that investors don't believe MB can grow CRM at a pace organically to warrant the valuation. They likely think CRM will grow, but at a massive cost to the balance and share count via aquisition. If CRM is to make a move towards $300 MB is going to HAVE to announce a massive share repurchase or implement a dividend. Reinvesting profits into a company only to spend those profits on aquisitions is NOT returning capital to shareholders. IMO CRM is dead money past $275. People can thumbs down all they want but it's the truth"
$ORCL $CRM $WIMI Should be another good nex week to add to your shares . Don’t see any catalysts coming this week so if you have some more dry powder time to lite it up .
Best stock out there.
