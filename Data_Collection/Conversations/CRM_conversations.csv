$300 yeah
Don't you love this stock... I have had it for several years now and the CEO is wonderful.... The money I have made is wonderful too...:-)
"If this stock was realistically trading at what a typical valuation on a similar company....it would be at $100 or less. Stocks like this are piled into by wall street elite as a safe haven....they then keep each others positions propped up. Similar stocks include AMD, NVDA, TSLA, TWLO, etc....In my humble view."

"Salesforce UPGRADED to Overweight from Neutral with a $365 price target (from $280) at Piper SandlerPiper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin upgraded Salesforce (CRM) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $365, up from $280. The analyst says in-person conversations with new leadership over the last two days give him confidence that Salesforce should see a ""multi-year period of multiple and profit expansion tied to operating discipline and organic investments that can sustain growth."" Despite the 7% rally after the fiscal 2023 guide up yesterday, Salesforce has an estimated 2023 enterprise value to sales ratio of 7.5 times versus Microsoft (MSFT) at 9.3 times and Adobe (ADBE) at 14 times, in part because it has emphasized growth over margins for the past decade, says the analyst. Bracelin believes the company's new team, new model, and new post-Covid reality point to a ""structural change"" that could result in a material boost to profits as it scales revenue to $50B-plus."

Our own corporation looks at CRM this way. They spend half a billion on social issues which translates to over-priced products and excessive wages for it's employees. We went elsewhere for our business need and saved a fortune. The results for us were fantastic.
