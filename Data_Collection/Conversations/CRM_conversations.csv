Holy sssssssss can't believe got in under 80 
"Getting accurate estimates is impossible. Yahoo Finance has CRM earning .91 per share on 6.24 billion, Think or Swim has them earning .92 per share on Revenue 6.24 Billion, and Seeking Alpha has them earning .93 per share on 6.25 Billion. Where do these estimates come from? To me if these estimates are based on analysts expectations they all should be the same, yet they NEVER are. How do you know which one is actually right???"
Guidance is impeccable 
Just when you think things are going to happen that is positive?? The big boys pull the rug out in everyone. If you sell now they will win.
creeping up nicely. $300 by end of year?
I sold my CRM at 248.72. I’d like to see sub-230 to consider buying. Probably closer to 220.
"As inflation fears creep in, look at how DOCU and SNOW have exploded without profitability. CRM is drastically undervalued given its profitability & growth. This is bound to have a meteoric rise. $280 is in sights in the coming months. Perhaps $300 by years end or higher"
"Yahoo finance has the price target for Salesforce (CRM) at $273. That price is based on the average price target of 34 professional analysts. CRM is a great buy at the prices it's currently trading at. Buy shares and hold. Anywhere under around $230 is a good price to accumulate shares of this to enjoy the gains as it goes up to the upper $200's area. Whether you buy at $220, $225, $230, or even when this get back up to the $235 or $240 doesn't matter too much because all those will seem like they were a good price to have bought this at once it gets back up into the upper $200's. Good luck all!"
"AYYO UNCLE, GOOD BYE"
I love how people throw the word ‘investment’ around and then complain about performance over 8 months. I bought in March and I’m up 20% but I am an investor and will own this for the long-term.
CRM LOOKING GOOD! I’m expecting DOCN (Digital Ocean) to have a bright future as well.
Take off time ￼
This is 10 off a share from August.
I will keep buying the dips. In 5 years I will laugh about the price today. Almost 25% growth in revenue year ovee year. And that with the rapidly growing demand. Im sold
How high will this jump tomorrow?
Minimam $300 go to the moon

Red today
pretty sad price action for a blowout qtr
CRM is about to break out now that it has closed above short term resistance..
I am afraid to buy before ER....
this release will be the start of the run up to 500
"Rising price targets coming, so is $350"
salesforce.com is up 4.91% to 273.65
"Going to 280 by EOD tomorrow. They crushed it, as usual. What a fantastic collaboration platform, blows away MSFT Dynamics by 10,000 miles."
Solid report. No weakness.
Buy now since earning report is tomorrow afternoon?
"Expansion, guidence , CNBC crowing about, analysts jumping in bullish, , interview with Cramer coming up...I wish u guys ( and girls) could see my grin as I pour another glass of champagne."
Wouldn’t be surprised to see this red again and totally collapse next week…$220 new target
"Strong resistance at $229 - $230 range, once it breaks we will take off to test the new resistance at $240, and once that is broken we could easily reach $300 as more buying pressure will kick in....! Lets do it longs!"
Hey Marlo......any observations today???
Buy dips here????
calls at 270
I think it is time for sales force to offer dividends

"Market America Worldwide valuation as of 2017 was $7.3B, (there is no 2021 data on valuation) But if they are involved with $VERB this is important, & if $CRM & $MSFT accepted their integration of technology this surely cannot be ignored as well as VERB being Ranked #1 among sales platforms for direct sales by leading industry publication"
just deleted my stop loss order...
Just bought some more. I think Beenyoff is going to deliver on Aug 25th.

"Building a base. The bigger the base, the higher the space."
People really have no clue how to read charts…this is in a downtrend and has been for weeks. Heading to $230 and possibly retesting $210 when market corrects. This was the max price you could get for a junk company ran by a pompous CEO
"from the chart, the price is rounding out. therefore there is chance that price would go down slowly."
"can sleep at night type of investment , water the roses on pullbacks 300 here we come"
Shorts/mm's trying to close the gap up. The market is looking for bargains so they will have a tough time.Interesting battle.
There goes 241!! Wow 4% drop in 2 days!!!
"Just because Marc sold some shares should not matter, and an analyst pegging the shares at 265 is not cause for alarm. The long term catalysts are firmly in place. Don't get spooked by short term profit takers."
Need some opinions of y’all. Thank you so much

My wife just informed me...no s*x for 2 weeks because I did not buy more CRM in March...
"Salesforce price target raised to $320 from $282 at JMP SecuritiesJMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $320 from $282 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its Q2 earnings next week. The analyst notes that channel checks on the company's quarter have been mostly positive, with the highlights that included a ""large ten-figure deal"" with a networking company along with ""commentary around big deals in general""."

close above 250 please.
"Slack acquisition is amazing management analysis & decision, I was suggesting to buy this company back in 2019 in this bord. Congrats Long! $300 is loading… "
"Will CRM ever break back over $250? The previous high was in the mid $280's (Briefly) but fell after the SLACK acquisition to around $200. CRM can't seem to gain its momentum back, even with a good ER, I do not see any catalysts to drive price....Its will only move on emotion or sentiment, but do not see investors getting there anytime soon."

"Setting up to be an excellent stock to short - buy puts on, going into end of Q3-start of Q4. Mark is very popular but he is too much of a promoter and CRM is extremely overvalued - just like many companies in this current environment. The next bear market will make guys like Mark cry like a river."
"@uncle have an avg of 44%/yr return over last 7 years for total of 327% why are you so negative on this company? Did you sell early, or never buy?"
Break out to $280+
Nice to see this finally close above 250. Maybe this is the long awaited launch toward 300. It's been a very painful stock to own the past 8 months.
"CRM has been consolidating for the better part of a year...the longer the sleep, the greater the fireworks. Looks like resistance at 272 is going to be broken when the market opens, and the old high of 282 could be surpassed by the close."
"I wouldn't sell this stock. Love or hate the CEO, company has a long way to go. Principles before personalities. I'll take this principal over many others."
Good luck to all longs!
Look at ZM going up daily by 3-5% whole CRM struggles to keep 1% gains…what a broken stock and company all because of the pompous CEO
Buy buy buy!!!!
"Today, AT&T (NYSE: T) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) announced a multi-year strategic agreement to deliver entirely new connected experiences for AT&T's millions of customers. AT&T will deploy Salesforce Customer 360 to create a single view of every customer across every touchpoint—whether it happens in person at a storefront, over the phone, in a business setting or on any AT&T digital property. The announcement is part of AT&T's broader transformation to accelerate momentum in wireless, 5G, fiber-fed broadband and software-delivered entertainment."
"This is probably the best stock to day/swing trade. I have already made a few thousand dollars in the past few weeks day trading it. Here's why:It trades between $219-$225 outside of a few days where it dropped to $216 and went up to $230. So, it's essentially in this range until next earnings come out. If I buy at $221 for example and it drops to $219, I hold and wait until it goes back up to $222-223. Easy quick $300-400 play. Contrary to what ""UNCLE"" (or any other short seller here) says, CRM is not going to drop to $180 or even $200 unless there is a market meltdown again. I don't think this will happen, even if Democrats take the Senate. Maybe there will be a 5-7% selloff but that's it. There needs to be a REAL catalyst to move the market. And, with the Fed in control, I don't see a meltdown happening. Also, too much money is waiting on the sidelines to buy the dip. People are buying every dip. Is this healthy long term? No, certainly not. But, remember: for every bubble there was, it took a minimum of 3 years for it to pop (2008 and 2001 as most recent examples). We've only been in bubble territory now for, at most, 2 years. I'm going to continue riding this train.But that isn't even the main point. CRM is a large cap tech stock with a real product and real revenue. They are also best in class in their industry. And, they grow consistently YoY. A stock like this doesn't just drop by 10-20% unless there is *REAL* negative news that the market doesn't like. The Slack acquisition already happened. Beinoff said there will be no more acquisitions in the near future. The stock already fell more than 20% from Slack. What's going to be the catalyst for another 10-20% drop? Stocks are assigned value by the market. Unless there is news, stocks don't just drop 10-20% on nothing unless EVERYONE sells. Most people are not selling. In fact, people keep on buying. Look at ARK. As of january 5th, they own $50M worth of CRM stock. On January 4th, they owned $47M worth of stock, so they increased their position in CRM by $3M in one day. That's just one fund.The point is unless there is *REAL* negative news, CRM isn't likely to drop to $180-200. Shorts are playing with fire on a large cap tech stock with YoY growth and on a stock that has already dropped roughly 23%."
"Snow down , CRM will follow, love them in 2022"
I know a little bit about technical analysis and this is the best this chart has looked in 10 months. One or two good days watch the 50 cross the 200 and things should get even better. By the way love the bashers on this board. I say if you think this company is junk why don't you just sell and turn the page.
just hope it doesn't roll over like a lot of companies with great earning Disney is a good example

Good luck all.
oh.. seems Slack has finally closed! hop aboard the rocket guys!
Guidance raised. Up nicely after hours.
Buy now before earning report?

Going to drop. Place a stop loss.

"perfect stock if interest rates rise!!! positive cash flow, great future growth with Slack!! this stock is a no brainer"
260 this week
People may not agree with the Slack acquisition but Salesforce still has a huge foothold in the CRM space. They've exceeded their revenue targets each year. This month is the end of their fiscal year. IBM just purchased 7Summits to increase their Salesforce consulting expertise. I think we're getting CRM at a massive discount right now.
Hold or cash in guys?
$VENA $RKT $CRM Have you seen your spending habits affected by inflation
$CRM $WIMI $COIN I do love it when we are having heavy fud attacks.... GOOD SIGNS!!!!!
"CRM has lot of room to move up as it had been range bound for almost a year. Good earnings, good guidance, Slack deal is done, have to catch with rest of the market which has been up a lot."
do they report in morning or afternoon?
"This is a huge buying opportunity. The stock is down significantly on misunderstanding and needed information that Biogen needs to provide and will do so. Some of the insurance companies, need clarification on the drug benefits, doesn’t mean they’re not going to provide patience with coverage. This is also the same with hospitals, they want reassurance from the FDA, assuring that The drug serves the needs of patients with Alzheimer’s at the beginning stages. Once Biogen clears up this matter, address of the issues to the FDA, hospitals, insurance companies and general public, I firmly believe The company will be a huge asset in helping people with alzheimer’s. So, I do believe this is time to buy stock like Biogen when there is uncertainty, stock overtime will be close to $1000 share. .."
"down at the open tomorrow......CEO comments will be same old story....Cramer will have him on his show tonight...and he ""just can't figure out why your stock isn't higher?"""
An earning surprise should take $OKTA upwards just like $CRM did. I can easily see $300 with the recent momentum.
CRM always disappoints after earnings
Buy CRM. Most undervalued software stock.
"Salesforce reinstated with a Buy and $275 target, TOP PICK at BofABofA analyst Brad Sills reinstated coverage of Salesforce with a Buy rating and $275 price target. The analyst states that the company screens well in his ""4 M's"" framework for software investing - Market, competitive Moat, Management strength and Margin potential. Sills adds that the core business of Salesforce represents a $62B opportunity, while adjacencies that include analytics and collaboration software such as its pending Slack acquisition represent an additional $67B opportunity."
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Morin program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 6btc in just a week of trade."
Wouldn’t be surprised to see this very red by end of day what a joke
We are heading there guys!! Just need that boost from the ER next week and we are all good! In Benioff we trust

"@Michael - Don't make money? Sorry but that's just flat out wrong (or a lie). Most tech companies would source out implementation as it's a very capital intensive process. The tech company sticks to what's scalable, efficient, and profitable. Company grows revenue 20% YOY for at least a few years now which is impressive given total revenue has now exceeded $20b. Just look at the stock chart - it speaks for itself. Are you just sore you missed out? How many stocks in your portfolio did better?"
Is anybody concerned that we are not moving higher this close to earnings
When the water and the hype goes away the rich will still have your money. be impressed .
"Latest upgrade should drive CRM above $280 before ER next week. And depending on the ER results and no Benioff surprises (like prior reports), CRM will finally start making new highs and get to valuations commensurate with CRM potential based on all the investments made over the years.I Hope Benioff allows the integration of acquisitions begin to work and produce for the company. And I hope Benioff does not throw another curveball about another acquisition. Heard on CNBC this morning when Cramer mentioned ""exciting change"" to be announced by CRM....don't know how to parse that statement."
Beast Mode! Let’s go $300 
The action on this stockIs very similar to ELY stock and what happens in mid nov when they bought top golf.... drop 20% in the first few days then after the market took the time to understood the acquisition and growth potential it surged for 21 straight days.
$CRM keep in mind they officially closed the Slack deal this quarter. Could be great catalyst with positive updates.

The people that think they can read charts really should stop. This stock has been rejected for over a month at $246 and while the whole market has made higher highs this is still down 20% from its high…sell this at $246 and buy back very soon at $220
"CRM stock price dropped about $50 on news of Slack merger. This amounts to over $40 billion decline in total market capitalization of the stock. The deal with Slack was valued at $27 billion. So Slack is being valued at -$13 billion by the stock market! Of course, that is impossible. Slack has positive value. This means CRM is way undervalued right now. Will return to $270 range soon."

I should have dumped my CRM money into ADBE when it was at 460.
New ATH incoming
I'm a long time investor in Salesforce and when my son's company switched from Microsoft office services to Salesforce and Slack he said CRM was so much better in every way. Couple that will a big partnership with Amazon and I see a great investment continues here. Aqusitions have always stalled the stock price then after two or three earnings reports we see big moves up. I like my CEOs less socially conscious with company money though.

So realistically if the market starts tanking ( 20-30%), TVIXF should be going up significantly.. Could is good back up to 1000? Or do you think Credit Suisse controls this? You input is greatly appreciated, thank you"

$260.00 today
this guy is stuck in the $240's at the moment. hopefully there is a catalyst in the quarterly to get it over $250
Regardless of stock momentum the earnings was great and very good long term buy. No disappointment and fantastic outlook
"As someone who has been in CRM for a few years, let me share an observation for newbies: there are only TWO times during a year that you buy Salesforce. 1) when they buy a big company and the share price gets hammered and 2) when they hit their 200 day moving average. Study its chart. The 200 dma is around $202/shr, which is about $20/share from here. It is over SIXTY DOLLARS off its high. They DESTROYED their last earnings numbers. If you're thinking about whether CRM is worth it, knowing the ONLY reason the price is down is because they're buying a pricey but disruptive company that greatly enhances their product,... maybe it's time you buy some, then keep some powder dry in case it DOES go to the 200 dma. After that earnings report, and knowing that the Slack deal is baking in as we speak, I don't think it's going much lower than this unless there is a macro event out of its control. I have been buying more at $220-$222 even though my average before this was $131/shr."
"Salesforce price target raised to $290 from $275 at Mizuho2/17/2021 Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $290 from $275 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst's recent checks indicate healthy overall demand trends for software through January. Companies that enable digitization are still leading the way, although many legacy and/ or on-premises technologies continue to normalize, Moskowitz tells investors in a research note."
Last minute shoppers are coming in right before ER announcement. Think some may have been tipped off? lmao
anyone knows why CRM share price is up but call option is down so much?
"If you sold CRM, I feel very very sorry for you newbie., specially if you took a loss. You’ll never make money panicking. I learned my lesson long time ago. No stock goes up without a bumpy road. Tesla, amazon, facebook and so on and on and on didn’t just announce their IPO and become what they are now, it was a ride and you gotta be willing to go with it. The stock market is not an org that gives you money as soon as you buy. Trust the business, see the potential, hold and wait."
This is one to keep buying and holding for the very long term. Great company. Only going up. I see us around $300 end of year.

CRM run by Bay Area demo-socialists.
275 to 267 is the wrong direction.
Owning CRM is like watching paint dry or grass grow! Do we finally hit $280 going into ER in a couple weeks? I believe so as Slack acquisition should be absorbed by most investors.
"cant catch a break BUT when it does, $300."
That's it?
This is trading at a big discount to peers with eps upgrades on results. Slack hurt but will turn out to be a masterstroke.
Why down when all other cloud stocks are up? Is it because this company actually makes a profit?
GOOD GUIDANCE AS WELL. IT WILL REACH TO 300 SOON !!
This is now a 300 dollar stock for next ER

"I own some shares. Seems to me, there are two forces at work here. If large enterprises are reducing workforce, or even some companies going bankrupt, then that will affect Salesforce. On the flipside, Salesforce is exactly the kind of service/product that benefits from a remote work, tech driven economy where things need to be in the cloud. I think it's strong overall, I don't think they have any cash problems, but they're obviously not 100% immune to economic ebbs and flows. Still pretty good though."
"We see quite a bit of price swings yesterday and today. Obviously you had the ER, and the Fed meeting as major drivers. But today's pricing action does seem unusual... up until you view the opex for today.Looking at where the open interest resides, and you see a perfect definition of MAX PAIN. It's unfortunate (IMO) the growth of derivatives has such an impact on short term pricing action. And that is why I only invest long term now. If you don't understand what I'm talking about do yourself a favor and you'll actually learn something unlike 95% + of the posts here."
"I always watch and listen to the earnings reports of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft (all I own) and IBM (wish I bought when they bought red hat). They all say ""this division doing well, that division doing ok. BUT, THEIR CLOUD BUSINESS IS GENERATING HUGE NUMBERS AND GROWTH! They report this week. Next month CRM will do even better. Buy, Buy, Buy. Also, now is the time to buy 5G suppliers and Casino soft ware companies."
PT $300 CRM will come back stronger than ever with Slack integrated.
Smh why is there such trouble staying solid above 250
Whatever concerns that people may have is already baked into the price - excessively so. The stock will spring to the upside very soon. Risk / reward is to the upside - big time. I would not want to be short here. I have shorted various stocks before and held on too long and lost my profit and took a loss. My advice to shorts is not to be greedy. I have learned this the hard way.
Reason why we are not at 180 plus is the perception of decreased growth due to addition of recent acquisitions. Will there by synergy or dilution. Looks as though the diversification is not hurting as much as some forecasted and this should ease the negative influence on share price and get this back on track to steady growth. See you at 180!
"Investors may be finally seeing acquisition of SLACK as a positive for CRM, if this holds and we get an analysts upgrade maybe CRM will start a rise in momentum to get CRM back to pre-Slack levels around 270-280 by ER in late August. Thoughts?"

"SNOW was $10 below CRM Tuesday, now they're $22 higher....in just three days."
"Yesterday's candle is bearish but weekly candle is forming bullish, RSI and Stochastic turning hot. It may require a week or two to consolidate then it will continue its north bound movement. Holding."
"Now who said no analysts were positive on the Tableau? This from Goldman Sachs on Sunday: ""Salesforce is one of the most promising stocks highlighted by Goldman Sachs. In May the company announced that it will snap up Tableau Software (DATA) in a massive $15.7 billion deal. ""We are bringing together the world's #1 CRM with the #1 analytics platform,"" explained Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. ""Tableau helps people see and understand data, and Salesforce helps people engage and understand customers.""The deal certainly has the Street’s seal of approval. Five-star KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin notes that data has increasing value as enterprises adopt cloud and digital best practices, yet >90% of the $41B data management and analytics software market is still made up of traditional data software tools designed 30+ years ago."

"Yo... the acquisition was a big #$%$ move. Salesforce is literally showcasing its power by spending just a bit more on slack than Microsoft did on LinkedIn. I?ve been in 4 different biotech companies - all used salesforce. I?ve worked with salesforce developers and data integration experts. Just like how Apple created a niche market for app developers, salesforce created its own ecosystem for web developers. I imagine slack to integrate itself into the salesforce platform to allow a streamlined approach to internal and external facing aspects of business productivity."
How much lower after Therese unga!! Ran up on nothing diwn 10%
Down down down
JPM shills out making a trade for itself and clients before earnings with a price target hike so they can dump some shares into retail baggies

Don’t wait until earning call to jump in on this CRM. I feel positive that we are ready for uptrend.
"CIBC investors edge took $4,077 from me, for no rhyme or reason!I owned $45,760.04 (SLACK TECHNOLOGIES INC CLASS A COMMON STOCK)With the merger made by Salesforce $CRM. I received 62 CRM shares worth $18,862.88 and the remaining sum in cash, which would be $26,897.16.I transferred $1,897.16 to my personal bank account.I should have around $25,000 left in Cash in my Cash account on investors edge.However, I only see $20,923.63. I am missing, $4,077. Where is this money? This happen to anyone else?"
I’m thinking the investment community has lost faith in CEO. What a haircut yesterday on nothing except another much smaller deal .
CRM Is a stock which don’t gain at market gaining time but losing well when market going down

CRM has won back investor's confidence on buying Slack. The stock price should go up and over $280 soon. This is the only big high tech company left behind during the pandemic time because of buying Slack. Don't miss this investment opportunity. Good luck!
"Getting closer, only $30 off 52 week high."
where ya @ uncle?
"As Slack investor, I think all you folks complaining about how CRM has been performing is pretty funny...Slack was a rollercoaster of mostly red on green days and really red on red days. But the product is set to revolutionize how people work and how businesses get the actual ""business"" done. Its not a Covid play; its not a work from home product. People integrate their business processes INTO Slack and use it as a tool to get their product created, not just ""send memes to their friends."" I just bought into CRM today as I know its a discount right now and I know that Salesforce adding Slack to its offerings is going to be a HUGE game changer for Slacks' exposure in the enterprise platform. Its going to be an exciting next few years and I can't wait to talk about it with all you folks. Cheers to the longs!"
Yessss!
"Did you hear what Amazon said ""Cloud business exceeded expectations""Salesforce will do the same!!! Buy"
"I'm new to investing. I bought CRM at a higher price and now it keeps dipping. I still believe in the company although I'm quite disappointed with its perfomance for now. Hopefully, it will pick up soon! I really don't want to sell at a much lower price. Should I hold?"
"Sell this and buy BILL, which is growing like no tomorrow. I see $320-350 on that."
"breaking: Salesforce price target raised to $220 from $205 at JefferiesJefferies analyst Brent Thill raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $220 from $205 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Thill, who notes that Salesforce shares trade at a substantial discount relative to large cap peers, said investors have raised two main concerns: aggressive M&A and a lack of leverage on operating margins. He believes Salesforce needs to ""take a breather"" to digest the Tableau deal, thinks margins ""could be a step function higher"" and that Salesforce could do more to deliver profitability given its scale, and believes the company should focus on delivering organic revenue growth."

Absolutely amazing earnings report. Very long CRM.
"Salesforce sets a new long-term sales target at its annual investor day. It now aims to reach more than $50B in revenue in FY26 -- up from a pre-M&A target of up to $35B for FY24. The latest figure includes sales linked to Slack, which Salesforce has agreed to buy."
PT increase tomorrow to 350.
"Run CRM, run!"
"UP, UP, AND AWAY!!! CRM reports strong 2nd quarter earnings!!! CRM will reach $ 275.00 tomorrow!!! GO CRM GO!!!"

Goldman sacks price target for sales force $315
Invest in this stock by Tom and pick up this dip? What’s your thoughts on this stock will it go over 290$ by Tom when the earnings come out?
"Salesforce price target raised to $210 from $205 at Mizuho""Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $210 from $205 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q1 results, while technically in line with Street estimates, were better than many had expected following generally mixed checks, Moskowitz tells investors in a research note. While guidance was lowered more than had been expected, management's targets are conservative, and will likely be exceeded due in part to an accelerating demand for digital transformation, Moskowitz tells investors in a research note.""https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3101839"
"I wonder if CRM is going above $230 by the end of the day today, or if we have to wait until Monday for that! Either way, no worries here. This is headed to the upper $200’s based on the professional analyst’s price targets."
Most upsetting stock I have ever owned.
Predictable earnings. Stock will likely trade up to $280 over the next few days.
time for a major move higher - soon. this stock just keeps building power. Boolean
"Well, the big boys sold off yesterday. That?s how they clear out rookie investors/traders. That?s why the retail investor can?t make money. Hold thru the storms. Let#$%$ 255"
"I went all in yesterday on the dip. These 2 companies are both leaders in their field. This acqusition fits CRM like a perfectly fit glove. I work with Tableau and the way that they take data and simplify it so the average non analyst can understand it is nothing short of amazing. In a world of big data Tableau will just become more and more important. The combination of these 2 companies will catapult CRM forward for years. While there may be some price pressure over the next few days, CRM is headed much much higher in the mid-long term."
LOOKS LIKE a VERY GREEN SEPTEMBER APPROACHING...$$
Best in the business.
Yeah MB is ALL about creating shareholder value.............for SNOW shareholders
bears quiet
"Looking to purchase some CRM due to the current dip so I have been looking into recent ER:- Working capital is still less than long term debt however has increased by 1.6bn since last 2 quarters and is positive. This will be impacted with the acquisition of Slack which may put CRM in a vulnerable position for the short term.- Strong increase in revenue year by year and strong increase in earnings.- TTM PE approximately 53x based on current SP. A somewhat high valuation but also in an overvalued market.CRM tend to use non-GAAP figures, with the exclusion of stock-based compensation to employees, as a measurement of performance in their report which I have disregarded as this is not a true reflection of the companies performance. A solid company still within the tech valuation bubble but I think still a good buy at this price. Will buy a small position tomorrow. GLTA"
Told you $230 is easier than $250 while the whole market is rocketing higher and higher each day
Rejected again for the 20th time this year…cannot and will not pass $250 as soon as it gets close massive selling happens. All while the market is making newer highs …completely broken stock due to horrible CEO
"Q2 Adj. EPS $1.48 Beats $0.92 Estimate, Sales $6.34B Beat $6.24B Estimate"
Thank you hedge fund for keeping up and safe.
"As certain as the sun rising in the east is the fact that MB and his spending has effectively capped this stock at $250 for the foreseeable future. Buy the drop and sell it at $250 again, and again, and again, and again."
CRM can be the best performing stock in 2021.Happy New year and good luck to all.
Fourth day in a row we are down for a total of $7.34. What is interesting about CRM is it can turn around and be up $3.00 to $4.00 in a day. Everything looks positive for the future but looking forward to a green day !
244 shares deep baby
"Once Slack acquisition is completed , salesforce will climb to new highs. Let’s get it done."
The sell off has started. Back down to $245
"Short sellers are finished here. Cathie Wood (ARK Funds) recently took a HUGE position in CRM. And, as much as people think CRM overpaid for Slack, people don't realize this how valuable this acquisition will be for CRM, both in the short and long term. CRM is going to pop **easily** back to $240, minimum over the next 1-2 months. Lastly, Jefferies recently put a $320 PT on it. IMHO, that's conservative. Going off future expected growth, CRM should already have a $500B market cap. It is severely undervalued right now, and even at $300/share."
Everything MB does is interpreted by Wall Street as margin risk.
