Predictable earnings. Stock will likely trade up to $280 over the next few days.
just deleted my stop loss order...
"Salesforce price target raised to $320 from $282 at JMP SecuritiesJMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $320 from $282 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its Q2 earnings next week. The analyst notes that channel checks on the company's quarter have been mostly positive, with the highlights that included a ""large ten-figure deal"" with a networking company along with ""commentary around big deals in general""."
"Q2 Adj. EPS $1.48 Beats $0.92 Estimate, Sales $6.34B Beat $6.24B Estimate"
Absolutely amazing earnings report. Very long CRM.
What do investors have against CRM ? This stock should have gained 10% after earnings. Canâ€™t understand
"Yesterday's candle is bearish but weekly candle is forming bullish, RSI and Stochastic turning hot. It may require a week or two to consolidate then it will continue its north bound movement. Holding."
"Going to 280 by EOD tomorrow. They crushed it, as usual. What a fantastic collaboration platform, blows away MSFT Dynamics by 10,000 miles."
Don't you love this stock. I have owned it for two years and I think the CEO is great.
Why does Wall Street hate CRM ? Any thoughts.
CRM has won back investor's confidence on buying Slack. The stock price should go up and over $280 soon. This is the only big high tech company left behind during the pandemic time because of buying Slack. Don't miss this investment opportunity. Good luck!
My wife just informed me...no s*x for 2 weeks because I did not buy more CRM in March...
How high will this jump tomorrow?
"After 1 year consolidating. Breakout coming. As the saying goes ""the longer the base, the higher in space""."
"Holding my CRM shares until we break $300!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!see ACRX is breaking-out, now up 8%; look at the ACRX 5-day chart!"
An earning surprise should take $OKTA upwards just like $CRM did. I can easily see $300 with the recent momentum.
Funds looking closer to 7 not 6 Billion. stock future up in the air.
"UP, UP, AND AWAY!!! CRM reports strong 2nd quarter earnings!!! CRM will reach $ 275.00 tomorrow!!! GO CRM GO!!!"
Best in the business.
Is anybody concerned that we are not moving higher this close to earnings
anyone knows why CRM share price is up but call option is down so much?
Merrill Bank of America raised PT from $285 to $300
You should buy this before earnings this evening. If you dont believe check there financials. Aslo get in cyber security when it dips. Your welcome!!
"CRM has lot of room to move up as it had been range bound for almost a year. Good earnings, good guidance, Slack deal is done, have to catch with rest of the market which has been up a lot."
just hope it doesn't roll over like a lot of companies with great earning Disney is a good example
Solid report. No weakness.
Last minute shoppers are coming in right before ER announcement. Think some may have been tipped off? lmao
10 year 1 trillion company
B of A raised PT from $300 to $320
$CRM keep in mind they officially closed the Slack deal this quarter. Could be great catalyst with positive updates.
This is now a 300 dollar stock for next ER
My investment in stocks and crypto are really doing well especially crypto despite the fluctuations in the current price 
Just bought some more. I think Beenyoff is going to deliver on Aug 25th.
Congrats longs
"Just because Marc sold some shares should not matter, and an analyst pegging the shares at 265 is not cause for alarm. The long term catalysts are firmly in place. Don't get spooked by short term profit takers."
Regardless of stock momentum the earnings was great and very good long term buy. No disappointment and fantastic outlook
"We see quite a bit of price swings yesterday and today. Obviously you had the ER, and the Fed meeting as major drivers. But today's pricing action does seem unusual... up until you view the opex for today.Looking at where the open interest resides, and you see a perfect definition of MAX PAIN. It's unfortunate (IMO) the growth of derivatives has such an impact on short term pricing action. And that is why I only invest long term now. If you don't understand what I'm talking about do yourself a favor and you'll actually learn something unlike 95% + of the posts here."
"Latest upgrade should drive CRM above $280 before ER next week. And depending on the ER results and no Benioff surprises (like prior reports), CRM will finally start making new highs and get to valuations commensurate with CRM potential based on all the investments made over the years.I Hope Benioff allows the integration of acquisitions begin to work and produce for the company. And I hope Benioff does not throw another curveball about another acquisition. Heard on CNBC this morning when Cramer mentioned ""exciting change"" to be announced by CRM....don't know how to parse that statement."
