looking to get out on the next pop to 3.00
how long before institutions give up and sell all they own?
Is there any reason to believe this company will ever trade higher?
What's it going to take?
"Trivago weekend platform is building out, as is experience features, now is good time to implement to be fully ready, on travel return when majority masses are fully vaccinated. Accumulation now will pay later. Next year should be a ground breaker imo. Buy - Hold like your investing!"
Any near term hope ? --
this stock...wth
"I currently hold a fraction of that I held on this stock at my peak, only 20k shares today. It’s enough if we get this right to make some real money. I think the travel play will work in 2022! I just came back from two weeks in Italy and it was a breeze! No major issues, not hard to get tested here in the states and in Italy upon leaving. No long lines in airports, no one got sick. Restaurants were open and people were having fun. Seemed very normal to me. Delays variant is as we expected out of London, a weak variant but very contagious. Things look much better than before. I hate to say this is the time but I think we are very close to being back to normal. I don’t know that that means for travel and this stock! Trvg was $2.5 pre covid.... GLTYA"
"Has ""Tax Loss Harvesting"" for this stock ended yet?Back up to $4.50 PPS next year?"
"Seriously, Is this Company ALIVE? Hello?"
"Summer is not happening. Coastal CA Hwy 1 isn't bumper to humper, it's just my imagination, running away again. Off the hook! These peoples are not going to get out of their cars, their self isolated on a car bubbled. No worries.... yeah, right? Scooby Doo...."
Merck's viral pill = game changer --> reopening???
Best time to buy is when theres blood in the street- is that right? or should I wait until it goes up?
just bought 10000 shares
"Once the travel sector fully recovers this will be ranging between $7-10 I think, as long as debt doesn't get too high"
Cool news
"millionaire-maker potential article featuring yours truly, whoo!"
with this rate the tock will reach $23 in 5 years.
I wouldn't doubt deals been stuck to buy at discount accumulation in progress
"59 institutions own millions of shares yet people are selling and price is going down, why??????????"
In at 1.80 and 2.19 or something. Sold a ton of calls but now bored with this. Move to 4 already. Europe is traveling like crazy right now.
"Trivago sponsoring chelsea training kits. That's an odd move for a german company with a terrible name. However, it does seem they are willing to market. Still some of the best fulfillment software in europe. Good bye or put sell at these prices."
"Relax, unsettled arena at the moment. Cooler heads will prevail. This will be back to $4 soon enough."
Travel stocks highlighted on CNBC this morning --
"At the end of day, best of class will always win out"
Tell me again why I should still be here?Is it worth waiting maybe years to get out from under here?Bet on the wrong horse imo
"November 1st is third-quarter results, so, ah, this MONDAY! I can hardly wait!"
"it is expected to see 24 variants of covid every year, so travel stocks are zilch, down the drain, I have lost over 50% of the value of my trivago stocks in 6 months."
"Some hedge fund sold today. I wish the 2.5 puts had some juice in them. If it hits 2.20 or lower, I'll buy."
Trivago is a long term play. Travel won't fully open up until 2022 and then people will bandwagon. Not much profits for now but if you load up next year this will pop on better earnings and then people trying to hop on at the last minute will push it higher. I'm planning to have 100k on this stock going into 2022 and then if it pops to $8 or $10 that 100k will be a half a milly
"Variants, smariants. If your vaccinated it dosen't really matter, unless your not. Covid slowdown will weed out weak players, who can't weather the storm. What emerges after, is the stronger hand. Trivago is in lean mean position for survival, long term play. No debt, strong cash position, low overhead, market leader. Hold-accumulate. Bite me, Shorty you'll never see my shares. Long- Strong."
Why is TRIP up so much today and why won't this stock breakout?!
Ran some quick calcs on travel against trvg and this stock is about 8% under valuation compared to LTM trading. I used a few peers and a tech travel index. Most stocks/indicted are down 38-45% from the highs back in March. Most have rebounded from the lows of August/September nicely except for trvg which lags 8%.
if earnings were going to be great stock wouldn't be at 2.53 imo
"lol...today add 5000 to $ 2.51 and at the end of the day I earn $ 200, only lost 0.18 cents on my other 5000 shares that I owned, if it keeps going down I keep adding, good luck"
"Technically speaking the stock chart looks good over the last 5 days, tending higher"
"Travel is having a tough time but I've worked with Trivago, they have a great business model and their app and website are easy to use. Will go back into the teens in a few years"
"Prediction OTAs to step back, as Meta Search makes huge comeback, in the next few years."
52 Week Range 1.2500 - 5.8800Enough said.
"I'll tell ya who's getting a haircut TRIP, maybe that $99 dollar annual fee isn't flying so well? Trivago gets best discounts for free- step aside Trip, Trvg looking to eat ur lunch!"
