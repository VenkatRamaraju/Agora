"Really strong climb up today. Tempted to take some profit but held off. TRVG will be at least a $10-12 SP stock within a year or two. As Covid19 is mitigated by global vaccine efforts, we will see a monstrous ""roaring 20's"" of travel exceeding the 1920's ""roaring 20's"" after the pandemic of 1918/19 diminished. Folks are itching to get out there!"
Im not a to the moon guy but looking at trvg chart this thing is about to pop.
"Buy TRVG (Trivago) as soon as possible, more travelers are pouring out now ""as more passengers resume travel, following a weekend when airport volumes hit their highest levels in a year. Delta Air Lines Inc. bookings began picking up five or six weeks ago as people have begun making plans for spring and summer, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said at an industry conference Monday."" by the wallstreetjournal"

They are going to figure things out and the stock will pop going back up to previous highs
BNA international airport(Nashville) had 1M passengers four days in a row for the first time in over a year.
Amazing that value stocks are flying (Dow) and this stock is flat to down! Should be $4.75-$5
Good to see the projected yearly share price increase from 2.50 to 3.26 thanks to upgrades.
Thud.What a major disappointment this stock is.Might only be good as a tax loss unless you want to hold for a long long time.
"Trvg doesn’t rely as heavily on google, as Trip, Booking, Expedia. Yes TV is more expensive, as Trip, Booking, Expedia will find out, Trvg is not as vulnerable. The holiday data report that Trivago is providing, is the industry front runner, mined from its unparalleled vast data base, that google is lagging, but eyeing to model after. Best solution is google to purchase tech in Trvg."
"If you used the Robinhood tradingplatform to invest in $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME,$KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG, and suffered losses as aresult of Robinhood's alleged manipulation of the market.https://cdn-ceo-ca.s3.amazonaws.com/1g1gguu-Robin-hood-Scam.jpg"
Par Capital adds an additional 6 million shares @ $3.74 in a private transaction just filed.Locked up for 6 months.Something cooking here?
Huge revenue miss
"TRVG is essentially viewed as a European stock; once Germany says it is past Covid, then TRVG will “rip higher” ... I suggest we are about 3 months from seeing significant change ... will oscillate between $3.25 and $4 for awhile, so do like me: accept it, accumulate, and get ready GLTA!"
Indeed: https://techstockobserver.com/did-trivago-nv-adr-nasdaqtrvg-just-create-a-new-and-very-helpful-narrative/
"Trivago has the most comprehensive advanced travel tech available, the other OTA are all playing catch up. Trvg is well positioned in the local domestic sweet spot, to take full advantage of recovery, it's a no brainer. Good luck once this becomes more obvious. Have a nice summer. Earnings are looking backward, the future is what counts going forward. You'll thank me later. ha! lol."
"Prediction OTAs to step back, as Meta Search makes huge comeback, in the next few years."
Think $5 this week.
"On quote from Robin Hood: So in other words destroy the revolution, the investors - not suspend the market, but only sellers are allowed to trade. In other words only those supporting the position of Hedge funds shorting the stock are permitted to trade. Can you imagine if the reverse happened? At least the corruption is laid bare, that's something - I hope Robin Hood gets destroyed. Then the next retail-platform will realise what not to do. From Robinhood “ We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG.

What about the year over year revenue growth and zero debt
Hope ya all bought the dip like I have been mentioning. $5 this week and $10-$20 on a craze
Best time to buy is when theres blood in the street- is that right? or should I wait until it goes up?
I look at this stock compared to other travel stocks which have doubled even though they aren't profitable makes me think that this has a lot of catching up to do. Flag pole implies it will continue upwards either next week or the next.
This company was a thing of beauty in premarket trading and then everything fell apart for most stocks. Tell me this game isn't rigged.
"they will be the 1st to accept bitcoins for hotel room purchases, going straight back to $20.00. Where is this news at???"
"Marriott, Wyndham, Hilton, Choice, etc., etc. loyalty programs? Not if ur looking to save some bucks while still getting a great deal. You’ll need a service that provides broad range of selection and choices, not tied down and limited to self interests. At the end of the process, for the most travelers, Trivago serves as the most valuable, potent and reliable travelers tool in the world today, imo. That’s why in the coming years, perception will collide with reality, because there’s so many really nice hotels, in so many different places, one or two loyalty programs is not going to satisfy or deliver that trip of a life time enough, when it really matters to you, your gonna shop around big time. That’s when TRVG will deliver the goods better than any one, anywhere, anytime."
"No Buying For YouWell.. today was crazy.After the chaos of the past couple trading days, the internet gang was looking at another sky-high day of gains. That is, until the premiere of Stock Wars V: The Brokers Strike Back. Robinhood was the first broker to limit trades on “high risk” securities like $GME, $AMC, $KOSS, and the others shown below.$BB $BBBY $CTRM $EXPR $GME $KOSS $NAKD $NOK $SNDL $TR $TRVGThis limit only allowed traders to sell equities, prohibiting them from opening any new positions. Naturally, investors panicked and began to sell stocks, driving prices lower and lower. As the day continued, more and more brokers and clearing firms followed. After intense backlash from the halt (including Ted Cruz and AOC agreeing!), Robinhood later issued a statement indicating they would begin to reverse the change starting tomorrow. The Senate plans to hold a hearing on what happened today. We’ll wait and see if Washington takes action."
What is different now than on March 16th when the stock was around 5?Isn't the picture rosier now?
Trvg about to break out! It’s been spotted by main stream now! Recent Catalysts: 1)Travel coming back 2)Low price stock attractive to millennials 3)Already moved to $5 on reddit folks a few weeks back 4)Series of recent upgrades We could see $10-$20 over the next 5 months on the market craze!
What's it going to take?
"Variants, smariants. If your vaccinated it dosen't really matter, unless your not. Covid slowdown will weed out weak players, who can't weather the storm. What emerges after, is the stronger hand. Trivago is in lean mean position for survival, long term play. No debt, strong cash position, low overhead, market leader. Hold-accumulate. Bite me, Shorty you'll never see my shares. Long- Strong."
"I heard Europe has extremely good growth this year which will benefit Trivago. Also, a little bird told me there are companies currently looking to acquire Trivago due to the low valuation......TripAdvisor, Priceline, CTRP, and Exepdia are all excellent acquisition targets"
What a trade kids! I was lucky enough to sell allMy stock at $5.20! Then added back today at $2.60. I will add more as she drops. I was in this for weeks before on the back to vacation play! I always thought $5 was a good price. I think this could make a run to $10 on a squeeze!
"Covid, or no Covid, people are traveling, especially in Trivago's local zones, like theres no tomorrow, the turnaround is inevitable, masks, or no masks."
"Trivago sponsoring chelsea training kits. That's an odd move for a german company with a terrible name. However, it does seem they are willing to market. Still some of the best fulfillment software in europe. Good bye or put sell at these prices."
Merck's viral pill = game changer --> reopening???
TSA travelers surpassed 1.6M for first time since pandemic yesterday!https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
So strange! Big volume as well! Someone is selling. Was their negative covid news in Europe?
"trivago 6.74 everyone will be going on summer vacation and even more in april , may, june ,july and so on .This means more bookings .Stock was way oversold .This stock wont be below seven dollars long . Would not be a short seller at this low price. With summer ahead , Its just starting to go up .This will retrace it steps back up"
"Finally some good news... hopefully this translates to TRVGExpedia — The travel platform’s stock rose 6.9% after it reported a first-quarter adjusted loss of $2.02 per share on revenues of $1.25 billion. Analysts had expected a loss per share of $2.31 on revenues of $1.12 billion, according to Refinitiv."
"I'm losing hope here folks! I mean did anyone really think this would just sit here like a lump day after day when other stocks for no real reasons go sky high, Nothing makes sense to me anymore."
"$TRVG simply wallstreet rates this as 50% below real value and shows strong future growth. To me this is an awesome growth and value play, how could anyone not want to grab at least some shares?"
"I just saw $4.05/share premarket! Boy, I hope that's accurate! "
"Travel is exploding but it’s close travel. Airbnb, local beaches, etc. NYC tourism is back. I think the massive flight delays and cancels due to lack of staff/ stimulus checks is hurting this stock. European travel is back which should help this stock! Maybe people are not making the right connection yet! I know their had been the delta variant scare but I read that 90% plus of the new cases are from non vaccinated people. Headlines are impacting this stock when we should be looking at travel data! I’m staying here until I get what I want"
What’s the eps?
Time to buy? I'm buying
If the volume hits 1 mil before 1pm central look for it to jump 6 cents or so
"to seeking alpha mr. ""sell on all rallies""...revenues are $50million euros higher than the previous qtr, to over $200million euros. his thesis of declining revenues is out the window. appears the germans are righting the ship after all-- 3rd straight quarter of profitability. who knows what a realistic valuation for this company is."
was one of the best options earners this last 4 months. 1.3 payout on 2.5 strike for puts and 1.4 payout on 7.5 strike calls. The steam seems to have gone out. Time to go back to Nokia I guess for steady earners.
Yes a Real sleeper today but this held up well considering I he market continues to slide! We may cross $5 and close above next week
"For the longs waiting for this to run, my I suggest the options market? This stock is by a far margin my best earner. You can earn up to 50% per month selling puts and calls. Excellent volatility."
"Trvg vs. LyftLyft has no competitive advantage never turned a profit not even close, loads of competition checker cab yellow cab cash cab mikes cab etc. Trvg is juggernaut building huge moat thru hotelier direct channel to eliminate OTA. Top line growth to be added as Red Awning 80K direct channel units on board. As travel climate improves this year, 1B revs in line and Uber Trvg merge deals with room service offers, WS can’t ignore. Lyft 22B valuation looks really good I’m all in lol!!! In fact I may start up my own Johnny cab company why I need lyft?"
Rough place to be but holding its ground. All the way back to pre-covid levels when the world was collapsing. I was hoping the $3.5 level would have held her since that was 2019 levels. Crazy... I heard the delays variant declined as fast as it spread in the UK! This is good news.... travel is on like donkey Kong
Is this a reddit stock or actual good news?
"On Robinhood . In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."
This used to be 24 dollars a share wth
"Buy and/or accumulate shares, Some one will buy this gem."
with this rate the tock will reach $23 in 5 years.
"Seriously, Is this Company ALIVE? Hello?"
"I know in the past that TRVG has been viewed by the investment community with a jaundiced eye. I personally never held a position until early Jan. 2021 for that reason. However, they seem to have found their stride during the pandemic and really streamlined ops/related costs as well as positioned themselves to excel going forward. Since 1/1/21 I have been and remain, optimistic. GLTA."

does expedia's earnings affect trivago's stock in any way?

Once vacation season starts this will rocket up
"Relax, unsettled arena at the moment. Cooler heads will prevail. This will be back to $4 soon enough."
People stop telling how much the stock is going to be in a week or a month. Nobody knows.
just bought 10000 shares
From 8 to 9.60 in two weeks. On to the next one
Ran some quick calcs on travel against trvg and this stock is about 8% under valuation compared to LTM trading. I used a few peers and a tech travel index. Most stocks/indicted are down 38-45% from the highs back in March. Most have rebounded from the lows of August/September nicely except for trvg which lags 8%.
I also added a few k shares more than my all time highest stake in TRVG at the close! I still believe in this company - no one was or is buying this stock based on business travel
Let’s go!!
What a massive disappointment! I think it’s time to sell and move bro a tech stock in the hopes of doubling my money by year end! I can’t believe how much this stock failed me.
"yeah, this sounded legal and like a free market economy...Robinhood issued a statement on its blog emphasizing its goal of ""democratiz[ing] finance for all"" but cautioned that ""recent volatility"" prompted the broker to introduce certain restrictions.""We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary, the company wrote. ""In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG.

"Robinhood and other trading apps restricted Millions of investors from buying certain stocks because their BILLIONAIRE Hedge Fund buddies are crying!!! However, there is no restrictions for hedge funds to short a billion shares to drive down price and cover their short positions today. Hedge funds are allowed to gang up snd short 140% of a company’s stock, but common people are not allowed to buy, while the SEC is sleeping (hopefully not with billionaires!) and allowing all these to happen.

Saw the first Trivago commercial on TV today. This would indicate to me that they are starting to ramp up.
Thanks whomever is driving up the price. In at 1.8 and selling 2.5 puts and 7.5 calls all day long for some big upside.
"The Transportation Security Administration in the U.S. screened more than 10 million travelers over the July Fourth holiday weekend, but a different story is emerging overseas. Parts of Asia, Europe and Australia have new lockdowns and reimposed travel restrictions due to the fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus. This could impede the comeback for the travel industry in the second half of the year."
8s this week? seems like it wants to reverse...above 8 I'd think traders would step in on reversal and move to close the 10.28 gap...good entry here
"Hmmm releasing earnings early*ish, May 3. This could get interesting "
Basically sums it up...https://techstockobserver.com/will-trivago-nv-adr-nasdaqtrvg-quit-missing-the-whisper/
"if you go to sleep for the next five years(rip van winkle) will Trivago still be here? I think yes, in one form or another, perhaps as ""bolt on"" to Vrbo-Trvg or Airbnb, as part of Expedia being bought, imo. goodnight kitty!"
"Today 5/5/2021 1) Deutsche Bank Adjusts Price Target for Trivago N.V to $4 From $2, Maintains Hold Rating2) DA Davidson Adjusts Price Target on Trivago to $3.75 From $1.35, Maintains Neutral Rating"
"TvGo is significantly pulling back it’s advertising spend, focusing, on profitability. Revenues are anticipated to continue to decline, proportionately, but should the numbers come in with surprise, look out for the comeback, buy out, and or squeeze?"
I’ve been holding trivago since last year at around $4. I thought this would be a good stock that might be the next big travel stock. Unbelievable that it had dropped to this range. I had made the choice to let it go and cut my losses before earnings.
"I think TRVG is dropping 3% today because Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a delay of four weeks to the next phase of England’s lockdown reopening, amid a surge in the delta variant of Covid-19"
"It's only a matter time before it returns to the mid 7's. The Boeing fiasco this quarter didn't help much, unfortunately."
$2.50 level is holding strong in Trivago over the past 2 days
"Strong buy on a any ER pullback, Trvg acquisition weekend application makes taking flight trips, hotel, car rentals smooth as cake, all best of class in same place at your finger tips. Better tech than trip, Google and Booking. Expedia is the winner, forget Tzoo, narrow flight-hotel access either-or only limits. Long haul travel is finished until 2023 at least, local domestic trips are in vogue now, and trvg nails it, great times coming, load the boats up, while we can!"
Europe welcoming US travelers & EU procuring 1.8B Pfizer shots...Europeans are going to vacation aggressively this summer and Trivago will benefit. Very much liking this stock at these levels
"Only site that you can see all the hotel prices from thousands of different agencies, anyone that book hotel room without searching in Trivago first know that he paying over price,"
Timing is everything 
"Trivago Posting record double-digit net income, Priceline is Over 1,000 a Share.. This Is Great Opportunity To Get Into The Next Big Player in Single Digits"
I could see this at $5-$10 in the next month or so! And that’s with no reddit craze! Just the back to travel play...
"Stimulus checks on the way... Vaccines are out... Everyone thinking of warm weather Spring, summer time and vacation.... This stock is poised to hit $7.50 by May and then $10 by June... A good momentum stock... Go long..."
"I thought we might me up alot more today given all the positive news with more vaccinations and the House passing the stimulus bill. Well, the day is not over yet."
I figure in 5 years we will rich with this stock. the price was $23 in 2017
"TRIVAGO needs to put there employees to do more work and add a ""THINGS TO DO & SEE"" section on the TRIVAGO website. How many of us have traveled to some city and have NO CLUE whats happening in that city. Add a simple """"THINGS TO DO & SEE"" Button after each search result. Start small with established High profile Events, Coliseum, Parks, Zoos, Lakes, goverment building, etc. then start teaming up with Local clubs, bars, churchs, etc where they can post their own stuff. Come on TRIVAGO..get a little more work out of your EMPLOYEES. There watching too much ""Foosball"". I love DORTMUND by the way! ..Best soccer team in the world."
Nice run up. perfect storm of positive expedia story. end of lawsuit stories. and top of the year.
"Short selling ganging up all over it, not letting it breathe!Gonna have to cover some day."
Best website 2 book a room with.
Wondering why red today with all good news regarding reopening and overall market up?
I’m just wondering who’s selling at this price!!!!! Will regret big time
"There are 350 million shares outstanding while the float is only 5% if that. If the company were to release another 45% or half the current shares outstanding, TRVG would be trading under $2.00"
Hopefully close over $4 today. Market has been focused on stocks that really sold off and were great values.
Buy now before massive short covering take it to $8
Why is TRIP up so much today and why won't this stock breakout?!
Price vs sales of 1
"Some hedge fund sold today. I wish the 2.5 puts had some juice in them. If it hits 2.20 or lower, I'll buy."
TRVG is up 8.62% to 5.04
"Is travel making a comeback? It sure looks like it, based on forecasts for Memorial Day weekend. More than 37M Americans are expected to travel from Thursday to Monday, which is up 60% from last year, according to AAA. The need to get out follows a successful coronavirus vaccination campaign, as well as a reduction in COVID-19 cases, and comes despite gas prices that have skyrocketed across the country (90% of travelers will be driving).Bigger picture: Security lines have been stretched at the busiest U.S. airports, with 2.5M people expected to travel this weekend. Helping supply the ferocious demand is the launch of new U.S. budget carriers: Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways. The two are targeting smaller airports and underserved routes, and could put more pressure on larger carriers like JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU), Southwest (NYSE:LUV), American (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta (NYSE:DAL) if they survive. The last U.S. airline to launch, Virgin America, folded in 2018.""It is night and day, compared to 2020,"" said Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group. ""Hotels are booked full, companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Vrbo (NASDAQ:EXPE) say they are sold out in many communities, and rental cars are all but impossible to find."""
Timothy my guess is the we say someone taking profits today or someone that needed to bail based on portfolio mgmt! Look at the volume. Someone was hitting the bid all day! I see this from time to time and it can be a great opp. They did the same to other smaller stock of mine today! Travel was up but TRVG was down
Is there any reason to continue holding this stock from an objective viewpoint?
"Sky is falling?I googled nice hotel in certain city, one night, one person, came up $181.00, not too bad. Booking, Expedia came up too expensive. Trivago ultimately slashed price to $122.00. I went back to google who slashed price to $149.00, then finally $127.00. That’s why they hate Trivago. Consumer will lose in the end, without trivago. Booking, Expedia, not to mention Trip will suffer just as much, if google gains a strong foothold in travel. I don’t see Amzn reentering travel and I don’t see Trivago folding anytime soon. The European over sight ETTSA is watching but staying quiet for now. I think Trvg has something up its sleeve, but long term. Imoo."
J & J Vaccine will get approval this week after this mornings reccomendation. Travel stocks will get another boost. Should be at 5 soon enough.
It's a good time to buy and/or accumulate shares.
"Trvg AI Data Science is at the industry cutting edge potentially leading the way to ground breaking new insights, providing tangible value proposition for acquisitions prospects, and or expansion opportunities. If Amzn plans to make an entry, the science could prove to be the swaying factor, in a big way, imo."
I had this before the crazy ride yesterday and I will hold it to at least to $10 or $20. It's a good company and the stock is cheap. It will fly by spring as the vaccine begins to take hold and travel opens up.
Any predictions today
"Once the travel sector fully recovers this will be ranging between $7-10 I think, as long as debt doesn't get too high"
What happened? 10% drop without any news...
The CDC news left the markets a day later. Focus moved on. Don’t count pennies; count $1’s. No victory here but better than red. Still think we flush to $2.75. Volume remain anemic.
"Travel is having a tough time but I've worked with Trivago, they have a great business model and their app and website are easy to use. Will go back into the teens in a few years"
"Booking is the major revenue partner at 60%, up from from 39% two years ago. Expedia will need to catch up to keep up, meaning once the Travel industry starts churning full steam ahead, Trivago will greatly benefit, imo. Great entry point all day long here!"
"Summer is not happening. Coastal CA Hwy 1 isn't bumper to humper, it's just my imagination, running away again. Off the hook! These peoples are not going to get out of their cars, their self isolated on a car bubbled. No worries.... yeah, right? Scooby Doo...."
My vote is $5 and close above for the week!
"Trivago needs to expand into flights, experiences, rentals, and rating reviews, to deliver more competition to booking, trip and Expedia. Trvg must carve out its niche, with the best deals, not just with hotels, but offer up competitive deals over all. Then Trvg will become a Prime take over target, hopefully, Amzn figures this out first."
"lol...today add 5000 to $ 2.51 and at the end of the day I earn $ 200, only lost 0.18 cents on my other 5000 shares that I owned, if it keeps going down I keep adding, good luck"
What month do people think folks will start taking travel vacations in any appreciable fashion? I'm thinking June.
it will go up to 7
Trivago is a long term play. Travel won't fully open up until 2022 and then people will bandwagon. Not much profits for now but if you load up next year this will pop on better earnings and then people trying to hop on at the last minute will push it higher. I'm planning to have 100k on this stock going into 2022 and then if it pops to $8 or $10 that 100k will be a half a milly
Is there any reason to believe this company will ever trade higher?
Nice post market action near $4. Anyone that bought the last few ways should be very happy soon. I’m hearing California restaurants are packed with lines. Wait until travel opens up
"fwiw, recent filings of ownership........big boys here!http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/summary/?id=8752493"
"Volume remains anemic, growth trade back on, seller still exists. Look for $3.25 as next support"
this is a great opportunity to short - it's clearly not generating any more buying power at these levels.this one will retest the low $6's - I just shorted a bunch here
5.50-5.60 test coming - short was the play from the $7's as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago.Another rocky week or 2 max. Volume is low - nothing to worry about long term. Trade the swings to make easy money.
"Wanted to share more news from what I hear about traveling to Italy. Italy is open for travel but if your airline is not providing a so-called “Covid Free Flight” you currently must do a 10 day quarantine even if you are vaccinated with negative covid tests done within 48 hours of departing. United is not yet providing “covid-free flights” like Delta and Alitalia. You will be tracked by the health care system and scheduled a test after 10 days. This is soon about to change but is true at this moment! You will be called by the authorities and must have someone drop off food/supplies. It is unclear what current travel to Italy is like if you are not on the “covid-free” Delta flights. The difficulty traveling abroad could be the reason we observed heavy selling. Impatient holders moving on. I believe by September the latest, things will be very heated with traveling. Many people will be heading back to work which means work travel will be back on at some capacity. We are even hearing some events will be on person over the summer. We are close!"
hopefully this company will add on airline reservation sometime down the road. if they do stock will x 5
"With international travel still restricted local domestic travel is at high demand, and therefore puts trivago in the sweet spot, now, and more so, once the weekend acquisition deal penetrates market. More online ads vs. less tv means better reach and more targeted for lower cost to acquisition customers. Trivago is amoung Away ETF top fund candidate, points to this summer being a local travel blow out in the USA, then later the world will follow. Vago is on the cheapO at this level. You may not need a plane, a car, a ship, but ur gonna need a hotel. accumulate hold."
Hotels are hiring massively on LinkedIn. Recovery will take this up big time. Wake me up when it hits 20$. Long and strong
"I bought 2000 more at $ 3.69, it keeps falling, I keep buying, travel restrictions in Europe will end one day, and TRVG is going to rise above $ 8 easily,good luck."
Nice volume today! Trend is up now :)

"Theres been some talk regarding Expedia spinning off Vrbo, to unlock it's under valued potential. Expedia stating not in the near future, but also hinting the road map, alternative and hotel in alignment side by side, clearly defining the differences. Indicating imo a potential merger down the road. On the other hand, Expedia, could sell off Trivago, to AirBnB who is trvg partner. Win Win in either scenario."
"I got 3250 shares , should I add ,please convey a detailed opinion"
What's with this daily saw tooth pattern- can't the markets make up their minds?
i hope we do well this quarter
TRVG would trade down or sideways until Europe re-opens. that's where 60% of their revenue is. North America where vaccines are going better than Europe accounts for 40 percent...hence the hesitancy in the stock. load up and be patient. I actually want it to drop further....
TRVG is up 8.54% to 9.28
arrrgg. All the juice is now completely out of TRVG. 10% return on 2.5 puts for 7/21 and calls at .70 for 7.50 in july. Weak. Those were more than double or even triple that a month ago.
Very cheap stock that's been badly hit by Covid. Great website that gets hotels for the best value for money. Will see revenues back around $1b per year in 2022-23.Hold for a year and you'll at least double your dollars. Predict this will be $7-8 minimum.
"Nearly 50 million expected to hit the roads and skies this 4th of July weekend, per AAA and I think we may get some news at shareholders meeting, FINGERS CROSSED"

"Reading recent Skift article regarding Travels big winners in Antitrust Tech Crackdown, if Amzn is contemplating reentering travel space, it would make sense to me that trivago would be a great target, should Amzn be shopping. If Trvg can utilize Amzn Prime members reach, pitching amazing deals, would be a deep inside winner, imoo!"
Can't wait to get the earnings. Hopefully the stock sky rockets
6 month chart brutal. Hold for a long long time or cut bait?
"Has anyone else noticed the number of cruise line tv ads on tv and streaming channels? Since yesterday, I've seen Norwegian and Carnival quite a bit! Especially on Bloomberg channel! Good news in my opinion! glta!"
"bought in today ... trading volume was light for an up day ... as get closer to full vaccination (May-June?), we should start seeing some acceleration up, JMHO and GLTA"
"stumbled upon $TRVG ... did some googling and could not find any substantive perspective on ""why buy"" ... can anyone on the board throw out some thoughts? ... i would think #1 is that it will be part of the proverbial re-opening trade."
Wake me up when it hits 20$. Long long and strong
"On May 17, 2021 Refinitiv/Verus upgraded TRIVAGO ADR REPRESENTING from HOLD to BUY."
"Trivago weekend platform is building out, as is experience features, now is good time to implement to be fully ready, on travel return when majority masses are fully vaccinated. Accumulation now will pay later. Next year should be a ground breaker imo. Buy - Hold like your investing!"
It will be $20 by June 2021
I saw a Trivago commercial on TV last night so that's a positive.
TRVG will go to double digit when more good news on the Covid-19 vaccines are out later this month.
"All we need is for Musk to tweet ""booked thru Trivago, what a great company"" !!!"
"trvg will crashback below 1.50 by end of nov dec 2021travel stock will crash over 30 percent as bookingstart toslowdown andwanrdown do to dealt fear andspreadinglike wild fireout of control in usa. no traveling and a complete shut down to usa again to control delta as reseach show delta set to hitover250,000 to 2800,000 thiousand every day by end of oct to dec 2021"
$10 coming
52 Week Range 1.2500 - 5.8800Enough said.
"Domestic traveling already picked up... International traveling will take another 2 months as Germany, France and England are slow in vaccinations and France going through a 3rd Covid wave and 2nd lock down... in May or June TRVG will be trending above $7 and above $10 by August..."
TVGo let’s hoteliers bypass OTA go direct to customers - profits will eventually be huge
Bought the dip at $4.14. Take her to warp $5 Mr. Scott
if I am not mistaking TRVG reported 2 cents per share loss for Q1 2021... they cut cost...as restrictions ease they should bring more revenue with possible profits next quarter... need to also check guidance for next quarter.. so maybe not so bad after all... they beat expectations 2 cents vs expected EPS of 3 cents...
why this moving?
Gap is closed
"I have watched this stock go up fairly big for many days the last month only to give up all gains by market close. Today was different, really different. I don't know why. But I've been waiting to get in on a solid upswing day. I think I finally got it today."
Buyout by next month
PAR INVESTMENTS just disclosed 34.5% ownership of TRVG. Sounds like they are trying to accumulate as many shares to take this one over! Let the fireworks begin!
"CITIInteresting time for a downgrade by CITI. TRVG was valued $11 at last year's IPO. Underwriters included JP Morgan, GSachs, M.Stanley but not CITI...Since the IPO, cashflow revenues, earnings have improved. Just comparing TRVG to EXPE and PCLN, based on cashflow alone, TRVG TODAY should be worth $9-$11.Now if the revenues from PCLN and EXPE go back to 2017 Q1-Q2 levels, then it's a $20 stock. Rating: hold at $7? What? If you tell me hold at $10, I might agree, but at $7?Ridiculous. Clearly CITI analysts have their own agenda which has little to do with TRVG....My rating: strong buy till $10."
Great volume and + SP action showing on a day in a sea of red.
Wish I sold yesterday.Thought we had bottomed. I was wrong.
Serious accumulation happening!! All the way to $10!!
"price is down, low volume, no one buys it, every one sells this, , no one travels, the summer is over, back to school, it will sink again"
trivago is up 6.46% to 2.80
Today was a good day to begin to re-accumulate a fresh position after the profit taking of last week. Any SP below 2.20 is worth looking to add more IMO. Travel will explode starting late 2021 and especially beyond into 2022-2023 as Covid19 becomes much less of a concern. A 2-6 bagger possible over the next 24+ mos.
NYC is fully open as of last night. Fireworks to celebrate the moment and 70% vaccination achieved. These are milestones and positives for the world.
On some good news this stock will fly
dead money
"The plague is upon us, and this too will pass. As travel will never die, as long as man is alive."
What’s everyone’s thoughts on this climb? I’m thinking of waiting until the shorters drop it tomorrow to buy more stocks but does anyone have news on why the sudden jump today? The only thing I figure is places are opening up which is encouraging more travel
"Hotels show signs of life with long-awaited travel boom in sight, Occupancy rates at U.S. hotels reached the highest since lockdowns began, Buy TRVG (Trivago) as soon as possible, more travelers are pouring out now  Sales $1,300M,  next EPS +200%, share free float 51M only. Gross Margin 96%, Debt To Equity “Zero”"
RobinHood and other brokers definitely poured more oil on the flames by that restriction yesterday. They did free marketing for those companies and they got attention all over the world. Retailers will jump in heavenly and this result in spiking price of Trivago and big guys will join the party too for BIG gains.... Thank you Robinhood for putting Trivago on that list... I have just placed a Good till cancelled for all my shares at 50$.
"Has ""Tax Loss Harvesting"" for this stock ended yet?Back up to $4.50 PPS next year?"
"Expedia (EXPE) is 145 $ ; Booking (BKNG) is 2173 $ , TRVG is going to be 100 $ soon."
The relaxing of Mask  restriction Will help this stock! Not saying I agree or disagree but sentiment is changing quickly to the positive side.
"Apr 16, 2021 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Somebody knows something "
"Earnings miss, lowered guidance, decline in revenue, adjusted ebitda. All major indicators point DOWN. PT is now $2.25. Cutting my losses now."
How does this stock have a $1B revenue with no earnings?
Google trends search on name Trivago shows solid up and to the right...perhaps an early indicator of upside surprise
"Earnings can be a difficult event to understand and forecast. Personally it’s an event I try to resist trading before but possible immediately after. Remind yourselfs that What happened was in the past and to focus on the forward numbers. Did they revise their outlook? Do things look better. More optimistic, tending better...Is managements tone positive?! I don’t place too much on the past especially under a covid past. I think we can learn a lot on earnings day but it’s anyone’s guess how things will open up and how humans will behave when they will be allowed to travel again!"
"ETF Managers Group LLC raised its position in trivago by 232.4% during the fourth quarter. ETF Managers Group LLC now owns 1,200,954 shares of the technology company's stock valued at $2,702,000 after purchasing an additional 839,654 shares in the last quarter."
"Timothy happy to shed some light here but I usually get paid for these insights. Last quarter we had four major hedge funds sell nearly 20m in shares. Two liquidated and two still hold/held 19m shares. Those two hedge are most likely still selling today based on historical sales from them (trend analysis). When Dan says things like “there is a buyer for ever seller and vice versa, well it’s true to some extent. Let me explain, if a large institutional seller like PAR has a broker working their sell order, the market gets drift of this and the broker has a job to do (best price) but often can’t locate buyers large enough so the market makers or specialists (prob before your time) take the other side of the trade. In other words, brokers buy the stock! This is done often at a large discount from current market prices for the risk also as I mentioned earlier, word gets out on large sales which pressures stock. I was a specialist on the floor many years ago so I know what really happens there. So yes there is always a buyer/seller but at what price depends on who is on the other side! On a positive, PAR paid for stock over current prices and below so they are just trading off a core position as I do. Also the 10 year average price is $6.38, so prices today are at a discount to this level. The stock really started to decline in late 2019, before covid became well known. Stock moved under $5 in 2018 as well only to hit mid-$7 levels. So I believe we are on a good spot here and is why I keep adding stock."
This will be above 6 in two weeks.
"Nice pop. Don't see any news. 24 to 7 is too far.Should be able to get to double digits. Almost 50% from 7, still 25% from here.If they actually have a good quarter when they report earnings, could even get to 12+.JMHO, emphasis on the O. Nothing to back it up.aa"
When do you guys think this will reach 6?
"$CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. to the MooN"
Is there anything this company can do to reverse the stock direction or are we looking at bankruptcy?
Guy Adami picked Expedia as his Final Trade on Fast Money. Getting some light on Expedia could help TRVG.
Good quarter. Dow Jones reports Euro -01 cent loss. Better than expected. Revenue was also 95.5 million and also higher than forecast. Volatility and covid to make it interesting for the rest of the year.
"have you seen any worse stock? keeps going down week after week after week, no stopping"
"Trvg lean and mean in the sweet local travel spot, on a global scale set to only keep advancing as vaccine rolls out worldwide. I think ""Booking"" is more dependent on Trvg, to survive, than vice versa. Booking, Expedia, Trip will take more time to recover, as international travel is slower to return, and 50% of their pocket book. Trvg as an ABNB partner, and VRBO relative will only become stronger in days ahead, Weekend launch is a genius move at right time, I have to congrat management, finally."
Priceline takeover bid coming
Is it a good buy to buy ? Long term gain ?
"So I did some research on the recent selling pressure and it appears that PAR capital is most likely the culprit. I happen to be be a subject matter expert on institutions. I spend a number of years in thIs specific area as a market professional. Order flow is another area I focused on early my career. PAR capital, top trvg holder of 30% shares outstanding, runs a concentrated book or portfolio or 31 stocks. They got into the travel stocks many years ago so it’s not a post covid play. PAR has been selling based on filings and based on our models they are grossly overweight trvg by about 7-10 million shares. We have priority models that dictate overweight-underweight positions from institutions so the 7-10 million overweight share comes from our models. Also in investigating PAR’s portfolio, they are 50% invested in travel stocks which makes up more that 50% of assets invested in travel. PAR is grossly overweight the sector. Personally I think this can be quite an opportunity to buy their stock on these selling pressure days. I added more down here."
I cancelled my $4 offer. It’s was a a small sale but I think we are going to fly soon. Feels like it. Risk trade back on and pent up travel demand is here
"over 1B$ in revenue with a market cap of just over a billion...This stock is grossly undervalued, especially with the year-end guidance Trivago has provided"
"Markets making a slow bleed a fast bleed! Let’s just get it over. I’m committed to much lower levels (under $3). Spoke to my Italian contacts this weekend and they are just waiting for the issuance of the vaccine passport. Then travel begins. Many people on the states are already traveling as the vaccine provided a false sense of security. We will see an explosion in travel like never seen! It’s hard to be patient but that’s how great investors need to be! Know your right and stay the course! Look at it this way, we are approaching levels seen near the height of covid. My heart goes out to the world as we try to get through this but we will! We always do... GLTYA"
"Gonna get me some gains today, i can smell it in the air"
$7.50 by late next week. Too much positive news in the travel industry.
"New York Times finally picking up on what I mentioned last week, Europe could potentially allow US travelers based on vaccine passport! I will let you know what I hear from Italy..."
Any near term hope ? --
"Local travel indicators showing to be off the hook this summer. Best in 20 years, or so. February shorts Trvg future earnings was a mistake, as long term prospects are excellent growth. Long term prospects still on track. Buy and hold."
Look ma TRVG going to $9
Back to 10 by the end of October
"millionaire-maker potential article featuring yours truly, whoo!"
I wouldn't doubt deals been stuck to buy at discount accumulation in progress
A Seeking Alpha article mentioned selling trvg on any spikes in share price...i'd only wish there was such an opportunity.
"About a quarter of the Americans and nearly a third of Brits said their goal for their first post-pandemic trip would be to spend time with family and friends they weren't able to see because of COVID-19 restrictions. For senior citizens, the numbers were even higher: 35% of Americans and 47% of Brits."
Will it hit 2 ?
"Nice pickup off the Reddit mention! It’s not new but we could sure use the lift! In the beginning, when Reddit first noticed TRVG, I was not happy thinking we were worth more than what kids could push a stock to in a day or a week. Today I am very much open to the Reddit craze pushing this stock to nose bleed levels and cashing out! I welcome it"
They spend a lot on Ads that are pretty good.
Good day to add! Many blessings in this stock! Stay strong and believe in yourself
"Short interest on this stock is surprisingly low at .005%. However, according to Starmine, the short squeeze score is 91 which means that only 9% of stocks have a higher likelihood of a significant relative price rise in the next 39 days."
It will double from here in a month.
Back to $15 a share soon !!!
I spoke to Italy today and the lockdown is the basic Italian way but it’s not serious. They are all more relaxed than ever same as here. Gatherings and waiting for the vaccine distribution. My contact owns a BnB (who doesn’t over there) and says that all of his apartments are fully booked through October!!! I’m all booked up since Jan!
We broke $5 Let’s go 
Great buying opp here’ I added back my sale from Friday! This stock never trades lock step with the market as in all travel stocks are higher. Also most of Europe is on lock downs again! They need to get the vaccine out there
Travel stocks highlighted on CNBC this morning --
This is a good level to start your accumulation! I loaded 15k shares at $2.25 yesterday. Was lucky to sell all my stock at $5.15ish. She may get squeezed again but either way travel will be back This year.
Coming back up!
its stuck at 5 like glue
"I can see this forum is so popular, wow! tons of posts every day. LOL. I I have lot %50 of my stocks value. can this stock go any lower? I may be wrong."
"News news news. Italy is opening now! Restaurants and wineries, all places. Phase 1. Let’s see on travel. Many are in line to get vaccine travel passports."
Holding 1.2K shares @ $4.58 average. Gonna keep holding because I feel passionate about the future. I’m done listening to reddit and what others have to say. Let’s go.
Interesting article from global newswire located at top of yahoo TRVG summary page from two days ago re weekenddotcom. TRVG aquired Weekend recently. Yahoo won't allow me to post the link here but if you open it (it's in German) just do a quick copy/past of the text into Google translator. I checked out Weekend's Website and was impressed with it's functionality fwiw...
Sold some yesterday near the highs and loaded alll day today! Loving it
"I'll tell ya who's getting a haircut TRIP, maybe that $99 dollar annual fee isn't flying so well? Trivago gets best discounts for free- step aside Trip, Trvg looking to eat ur lunch!"
"We knew Americans are desperate to travel again – but we didn't know just how desperate until now: 38% of Americans polled by Trivago said they'd give up sex for a year if they could resume traveling immediately. For Brits, the number was even higher: 40%."
"What just happened,Why it went negative in the last 5 minutes,Was it an option play?"
One day we're gonna look back at these prices and wonder what all the fuss was about.
"New York Life Investments Alternatives bought a new stake in trivago during the fourth quarter valued at $164,000. Institutional investors own 10.62% of the company's stock."
Longs will be rewarded 
Won’t be stepping in until $2.75 down to $2.5. Someone is stepping on this everyday. It looked to me that the founder sold a ton of a stock at the highs but who can blame him.
"I would like to see this Brand add airlines, cruise lines rental cars, etc to their platform. TRVG needs more horizontal scale. Is a great buy at this level, but a broader business model is required to get it into the higher double digits. I sent a note to their IR on this very point, if so get any response, I will share it. (understood, they would not likely share any biz model plans for obvious reasons). GLTA!"
"This stock was trading around $2.50 from Oct 2019 to Feb 2020 which was just prior to pandemic. So that tells me they were not profitable and stock was cheap for a reason. Can you give me facts why this stock will go up to $10 to $20 range? Please don't stay stuff like, believe in yourself, etc."
Bad management?What is it with this company?
"Added at 3.90 ready to add more at 3.60 if it goes there, which it probably will today or tomorrow."
Wouldn’t be surprised if it goes green on the eps beat
"That's right, international travel is dead for the foreseeable future, Booking stock looks cheap, over the last 5 year comparison, looking forward the next 5 years, only Trivago is looking cheap. The local domestic market leader is in the sweet spot, will be ramping up while the big OTA, is scaling back. May take awhile for the market to figure this out, as they're all invested in the big OTA's. We may pay the price until its demonstration turnaround time, and the market realizes the facts, like it or not!"
"#TRVG Technical indicators are looking bullish, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 5.08 for a run up to 5.93."
"TRVG (Trivago sp $5), Hotels show signs of life with long-awaited travel boom in sight, Occupancy rates at U.S. hotels reached the highest since lockdowns began, Buy TRVG (Trivago) as soon as possible, more travelers are pouring out now  Sales $1,300M,  next EPS +200%, share free float 51M only. Gross Margin 96%, Debt To Equity “Zero"
Way oversold. Time to accumulate. Will be over $8 within a year. Someone may buy this company at this label.
TRVG is so cheap price vs sales of 1
Most travel stocks are lower - use this as a proxy! Trip is higher on new service - Annual subscription.
