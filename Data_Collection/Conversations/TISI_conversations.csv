Back to the way it was soon 30. Good job Team and congratulations!... Keep the good work.
"If I read yesterday's 8k filing correctly, they received an extension on an interest payment for 10 days. And it sounds to me like the lender is wanting to add another board member that is agreeable to them. Did I read this correctly? Doesn't sound good to me."
"Financial engineering, continuous reorgs and initiatives always fall flat when you've lost your humanity and the hearts and minds of your people. Not recoverable."
where do you see the lowest point? which has been sold in the last few months for no reason. Rebount was announced for the fall. does anyone still believe in it?
Where are the Q3 results?
Team is down 11.80% to 2.99
There was no reason for the sale that happened since the earnings. It should've been the other way around. It will be back up as it was... the company has good improvements...
Team Inc (NYSE:TISI) Is Trading At A 49% Discount
"a turnaround should be possible. only because of Corona there was a drop in sales. however, sales are picking up again, as can be seen in the q2 report. nobody knows how big the agreement with Chevron is. Chevron is active in the raw materials sector, which is currently picking up strongly. The deal has lured investors and was sold off, after which it could buy bigger ones. More should come about this deal in November Q3 and the ceo intends to achieve the turnaround in autumn."
my company used Team. so I have personal experience with them. they did excellent work in my opinion. Don't know why the stock is crashing
"Tisi,A oil gas service company like Haliburton,, baker hugghes etc could come and buyout this one? At what price, 10 usd??"
Sure glad I dumped it all at 25. The latest restructure just added more layers and more overhead that can't be sustained when you are losing money.
Bankruptcy right around the corner ….
Seems clear at this point that Team will not recover. Terrible leadership @ takeover of Qualspec and Furmanite left the worst of the leaders of each in place. Now they have a guy running the place that spent millions splitting the company up only to discover that it worked better with separate divisions like it was and spent a bunch to split it apart again. New directions every day leaving employees with no confidence in current leadership. Team has no quality talent left in management and little to no talent left in the field. No training and employee development done in over a year. No training means no growth. What a shame.
"A blinding flash of the obvious - arrogance, incompetence and a callous disregard for people is the perfect formula for getting the results TISI is getting. This is textbook for how to screw up a good business beyond repair. I wonder what the record is for using ""headwinds"" in the Quarterly Earnings release? I think TISI is up to about 16 quarters in a row. Clearly investors has seen they have been duped for too long. Can't help but wonder why the BODs is not holding this team accountable for performance. Where is the fiduciary responsibility?"
It is a winner - stay patience buy and hold strong 
You can't make money by dishing out free jobs to gain work or by quoting jobs initially and have screw ups that add unnecessary cost on the back end.
"After years of continual corporate restructuring, questionable-at-best acquisitions, management defections and earnings disappointments, the Company finally ekes out a good quarter in terms of financial metrics. The market liked it, and the stock soared over $20 per share. Then our CEO takes the stage and literally throws all the good news out the window with an incomprehensible ""3 Pillar"" strategy with a $30 million price tag, much of it apparently going to consultants. What's more, additional cold water was poured on upcoming earnings expectations with the Company's plan to accelerate amortization of the Furrmanite acquisition. The analysts on the call, who I thought demonstrated remarkable patience, tried mightily to gain clarity on growth expectations and margins,etc. and our CEO and CFO gave long-winded answers that did anything but answer the questions asked. Gatti may have a great background, but he is in serious need of IR training."
quite possible. the price for this company is currently very cheap for a takeover
You know what…. Someone might buy this company.
The Furmanite management has done it again….$3.26
"Nick Saban said after his number one ranked team’s loss to Texas A&M, ""I'm responsible for all of it. We have to do a better job with our coaches. We have to do a better job with our players.""Nick Sabin is “owning it”. Is anyone in leadership at Team doing the same?"
Team is beyond salvaging at this point. Gatti spent a year splitting the company apart and shedding the talented managers and key employees that made Team what it was with his #$%$ ?One Team? project and then tried to put it back together with people that can?t manage or execute the work effectively due to the massive drain in talent. Take a close look. There are very few legacy Team personnel left. They all went to competitors after it was clear that Gatti was taking the company in the wrong direction. They were replaced by people that are clueless about the industry they serve. I?ve long since written off the investment I made at $20 and have moved on. The industry has become commoditized and Team simply cannot execute effectively with the loss of talent and lousy leadership at the top.
Senior management and the board are running this company into the ground. Look at the steady decline of the share value over the past 5 years for evidence while they have continually rewarded themselves whilst shedding staff and locations to reduce SG&A to sustain their greed.
Did investors really think 1st quarter revenue would be up coming out of a pandemic? A very good year is ahead and with an infrastructure bill passed our economy will boom. Invest in the future not the past.
"Well, my amateur opinions on this when I took my position were this. Generally speaking, any company can have the best product, best service, best employees, best reputation with its customers, etc. None of this matters if they are not able to turn all of this into a profitable business model. The business will eventually cease to exist. And, looking at the earnings trends, it appeared to me like this company was losing money before the current CEO was even employed with them. Something, in my mind, had to change. And the cost savings amount that was cited as a result of the One Team project by the current management team that I ran across during my research should have more than offset the yearly losses recorded for 2018 and 2019. Any price increases passed on to the customer or possible later share buybacks would have been icing on the cake. I was a bit disappointed that the losses were not narrower in this current earnings report. But I'm not going to panic just yet. But like I mentioned, I'm just another amateur investor. I'm not a professional by any means, and could be misreading a fair amount of the facts and events surrounding this company."
Up 24% with no obvious news. Why?
Bye bye CFO
"Boy, would I like to get a CLEAN copy of Cold Spring HARBOR, Billy Joel's first album. I would love to get a copy of this before next Friday the 15th..."
"Saw an article recommending this stock. Why would anyone buy this stock? Income over the past 5 years has been flat to declining in 2020. I'll give them a break for 2020. Looks like they haven't made a profit in over 5 yrs and they don't pay a dividend. Summary, flat to negative revenue growth, no profits, increasing losses, and no shareholder return. Am I missing something? Seems like the falling share price is justified."
"The current management is a disaster. When Executive Mgt/Senior Mgt makes 10% or more of market cap, then that is a problem. All of the cost cutting & reorganization they cite during earnings call is just #$%$ Something does not seem right. They hired a new CFO a couple of years ago & the market cap, stock price, earnings are worse. If that person is not being listened to by CEO or Board Members and/or if CFO does not have the skill set (business, not just accounting & financials), then something needs to give. This stock appears just to be a good ole boys gig just playing around with money, both theirs & investors. One would like that if their customers base is made up of financial stable companies, then those companies would have completed their ""turnarounds, etc"" during the pandemic crisis when things were slow and not wait until the upturn then shut down to perform ""turnaround maintenance"". Also, the new exclusive use of some software program is more hoax. That kind of stuff is old news. If a solid company is just now utilizing a software program to monitor systems & safety then whoa, where have they been. There overseas business seems to more about bluster/image than providing adequate net income to add value. Proof of how horrible the stock price is when the reworked the CEO's contract to lower stock price threshold for bonus's to kick in. I say, good luck to investors. Do your due diligence. They should wipeout all Executive Mgt to start over or close the doors. At their market cap, revenue, cash, debt...what more do they have to loss. Cheerio"
Bottomed out. Excellent entry point.
to not break covenants they only need 50 mill ebitda. I agree management is just horrible cfo could not manage out of a paper bag. I think Atlantic park the term loan lender forces the company to put themselves up for sale. A buyer with cost synergies could take out 20 mill or more in costs so say they value at TTM 80 mill ebitda at 9 multiple that IS 720 minis debt of 356 thats 10.40 a share
"Chances are they make another poor acquisition and absorb more debt. Case and point is look what happened to the Furmanite acquisition, they polished it up to look fine and got surprised with all this debt. Now those same managers that drove the stock down are in charge and you now got a bunch of outsiders come in and try to change the culture saying at NOV, Schlumberger, Haliburton etc. we did this when they really don't know the business. Saw the company go from $45 a share to a measly $4 within a 5 year span."
Gone are the good hard workers that gave a good deal of their own to make this company a good investment for every one.
Team is up 9.06% to 3.13
"Cash flow problem, lay off is a must."
"""The smartest guys in the room"" management this company brought in after (and from) the Furmanite buyout has been a complete disaster. They are completely alienated from the only revenue source they have...the techs. Enough is enough."
Could they be setting for a take over or a buyout from a larger company like them. It's possible. Could be a good time to buy in and hold see who bites.
"The board and executive management are clearly unable to manage this company. The CEO got $10M to watch the stock lose 75% of its worth in the 2 years he's been there. They forced anyone of value out and replaced them with people that know nothing about the service business. Employees have been forced to take severe salary cuts and work 20 hours per week. Most have used their savings while execs taker a measly 10-20% cut. There is no enthusiasm to work for Team anymore and these execs have no clue. The spiral will continue until someone buys Team at a bargain and sells it off piece by piece. Unfortunately, the employees suffer and the execs will line their pockets."
