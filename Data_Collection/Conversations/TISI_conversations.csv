"The current management is a disaster. When Executive Mgt/Senior Mgt makes 10% or more of market cap, then that is a problem. All of the cost cutting & reorganization they cite during earnings call is just #$%$ Something does not seem right. They hired a new CFO a couple of years ago & the market cap, stock price, earnings are worse. If that person is not being listened to by CEO or Board Members and/or if CFO does not have the skill set (business, not just accounting & financials), then something needs to give. This stock appears just to be a good ole boys gig just playing around with money, both theirs & investors. One would like that if their customers base is made up of financial stable companies, then those companies would have completed their ""turnarounds, etc"" during the pandemic crisis when things were slow and not wait until the upturn then shut down to perform ""turnaround maintenance"". Also, the new exclusive use of some software program is more hoax. That kind of stuff is old news. If a solid company is just now utilizing a software program to monitor systems & safety then whoa, where have they been. There overseas business seems to more about bluster/image than providing adequate net income to add value. Proof of how horrible the stock price is when the reworked the CEO's contract to lower stock price threshold for bonus's to kick in. I say, good luck to investors. Do your due diligence. They should wipeout all Executive Mgt to start over or close the doors. At their market cap, revenue, cash, debt...what more do they have to loss. Cheerio"
Bankruptcy right around the corner ….
Steve@ the company is doing better no doubt.... good improvements. Why you are saying worst investor conference call?
Team is up 13.90% to 9.75
"Well, my amateur opinions on this when I took my position were this. Generally speaking, any company can have the best product, best service, best employees, best reputation with its customers, etc. None of this matters if they are not able to turn all of this into a profitable business model. The business will eventually cease to exist. And, looking at the earnings trends, it appeared to me like this company was losing money before the current CEO was even employed with them. Something, in my mind, had to change. And the cost savings amount that was cited as a result of the One Team project by the current management team that I ran across during my research should have more than offset the yearly losses recorded for 2018 and 2019. Any price increases passed on to the customer or possible later share buybacks would have been icing on the cake. I was a bit disappointed that the losses were not narrower in this current earnings report. But I'm not going to panic just yet. But like I mentioned, I'm just another amateur investor. I'm not a professional by any means, and could be misreading a fair amount of the facts and events surrounding this company."
The Furmanite management has done it again….$3.26
"The board and executive management are clearly unable to manage this company. The CEO got $10M to watch the stock lose 75% of its worth in the 2 years he's been there. They forced anyone of value out and replaced them with people that know nothing about the service business. Employees have been forced to take severe salary cuts and work 20 hours per week. Most have used their savings while execs taker a measly 10-20% cut. There is no enthusiasm to work for Team anymore and these execs have no clue. The spiral will continue until someone buys Team at a bargain and sells it off piece by piece. Unfortunately, the employees suffer and the execs will line their pockets."

Let's support Engine Capital's efforts to overhaul this dog. Current management should resign.
Team is beyond salvaging at this point. Gatti spent a year splitting the company apart and shedding the talented managers and key employees that made Team what it was with his #$%$ ?One Team? project and then tried to put it back together with people that can?t manage or execute the work effectively due to the massive drain in talent. Take a close look. There are very few legacy Team personnel left. They all went to competitors after it was clear that Gatti was taking the company in the wrong direction. They were replaced by people that are clueless about the industry they serve. I?ve long since written off the investment I made at $20 and have moved on. The industry has become commoditized and Team simply cannot execute effectively with the loss of talent and lousy leadership at the top.

Chevron is active in the raw materials sector, which is currently picking up strongly. The deal has lured investors and was sold off, after which it could buy bigger ones. More should come about this deal in November Q3 and the ceo intends to achieve the turnaround in autumn."

I can't help but to think that with the overall demand for skilled trades, and the number of projects that have likely been delayed due to the pandemic, that a company like this wouldn't be in a solid position to benefit from it. I'd like to hear some thoughts from others who have taken a position here as well. If memory serves me correctly, there has been a notable amount of insider purchases lately as well."

Bottomed out. Excellent entry point.
That was the worst Investor conference call I have ever heard. The CFO was nearly unintelligible and the new CEO seemed woefully unprepared for the analysts' questions.
The upside potential for TISI just got a whole lot more interesting. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesom-eSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.

"There is no good reason for this company to exist. It doesn't pay a dividend, it has meager growth prospects, it has poor to non-existent profit margins and it operates within a low growth industry. Team also has a worldwide presence, which is silly given its low revenue base. The best course of action would be to merge with another services company. Otherwise, investors are merely supporting a employment operations for Teams' executives."
Up 24% with no obvious news. Why?
TISI is down 10.11% to 7.20
Seems clear at this point that Team will not recover. Terrible leadership @ takeover of Qualspec and Furmanite left the worst of the leaders of each in place. Now they have a guy running the place that spent millions splitting the company up only to discover that it worked better with separate divisions like it was and spent a bunch to split it apart again. New directions every day leaving employees with no confidence in current leadership. Team has no quality talent left in management and little to no talent left in the field. No training and employee development done in over a year. No training means no growth. What a shame.

You know what…. Someone might buy this company.
"After years of continual corporate restructuring, questionable-at-best acquisitions, management defections and earnings disappointments, the Company finally ekes out a good quarter in terms of financial metrics. The market liked it, and the stock soared over $20 per share. Then our CEO takes the stage and literally throws all the good news out the window with an incomprehensible ""3 Pillar"" strategy with a $30 million price tag, much of it apparently going to consultants. What's more, additional cold water was poured on upcoming earnings expectations with the Company's plan to accelerate amortization of the Furrmanite acquisition. The analysts on the call, who I thought demonstrated remarkable patience, tried mightily to gain clarity on growth expectations and margins,etc. and our CEO and CFO gave long-winded answers that did anything but answer the questions asked. Gatti may have a great background, but he is in serious need of IR training."

"A blinding flash of the obvious - arrogance, incompetence and a callous disregard for people is the perfect formula for getting the results TISI is getting. This is textbook for how to screw up a good business beyond repair. I wonder what the record is for using ""headwinds"" in the Quarterly Earnings release? I think TISI is up to about 16 quarters in a row. Clearly investors has seen they have been duped for too long. Can't help but wonder why the BODs is not holding this team accountable for performance. Where is the fiduciary responsibility?"

"Chances are they make another poor acquisition and absorb more debt. Case and point is look what happened to the Furmanite acquisition, they polished it up to look fine and got surprised with all this debt. Now those same managers that drove the stock down are in charge and you now got a bunch of outsiders come in and try to change the culture saying at NOV, Schlumberger, Haliburton etc. we did this when they really don't know the business. Saw the company go from $45 a share to a measly $4 within a 5 year span."
Senior management and the board are running this company into the ground. Look at the steady decline of the share value over the past 5 years for evidence while they have continually rewarded themselves whilst shedding staff and locations to reduce SG&A to sustain their greed.
"In my opinion, the only hope here is an activist group coming in and demanding an ouster of management and the board of directors, similar to what transpired at Furmanite before it was acquired by Team. The market gave a very clear answer to what it thought of the Company's 3 pillar strategy -- simply check out the stock price right before the earnings conference call compared to the closing price that day."

"Saw an article recommending this stock. Why would anyone buy this stock? Income over the past 5 years has been flat to declining in 2020. I'll give them a break for 2020. Looks like they haven't made a profit in over 5 yrs and they don't pay a dividend. Summary, flat to negative revenue growth, no profits, increasing losses, and no shareholder return.

"Rumor of a merger or acquisition is in gear, stock should jump to 15-18 VERY soon."
There was no reason for the sale that happened since the earnings. It should've been the other way around. It will be back up as it was... the company has good improvements...
another nice move
"If it looks like #$%$ smells like #$%$ then it?s still #$%$ Team management has an incredible ability to distract investors and provide false hope they can work themselves out of a huge hole of debt; all whiles generating negative net profits. The only way out is if Team raises their prices and they gets smaller. Consider raising prices across the board and firing 10% of the highest revenue lowest contributing margin clients. If they do this their entire situation wil improve exponentially. However until someone gets a pair and begins leading this company out of the financial ruins, Team will remain a dud."

Back to the way it was soon 30. Good job Team and congratulations!... Keep the good work.
is this a good buy?
to not break covenants they only need 50 mill ebitda. I agree management is just horrible cfo could not manage out of a paper bag. I think Atlantic park the term loan lender forces the company to put themselves up for sale. A buyer with cost synergies could take out 20 mill or more in costs so say they value at TTM 80 mill ebitda at 9 multiple that IS 720 minis debt of 356 thats 10.40 a share
"Owen needs to resign and an established operational turnaround manager should be hired. By management's own statements, things are not going well. It seems unlikely that a strategy of layoffs is the answer here. As others have noted, the Company bit off too much at once, and despite a very low price paid to acquire Furmanite, it seems that acquisition has gone sour."
Could they be setting for a take over or a buyout from a larger company like them. It's possible. Could be a good time to buy in and hold see who bites.

Sure glad I dumped it all at 25. The latest restructure just added more layers and more overhead that can't be sustained when you are losing money.
"The problem with this company might be integration risks/issues given the series of acquisition they made. Even worse, one of those acquisitions was Furmanite---the only NYSE company I am aware of that agreed to be acquired at basically half the rumored value of the first offer they allegedly received from another suitor. If this is any indication of the management of that company, it doesn't bode well for Team"
