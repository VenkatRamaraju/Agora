Today was a bit disappointing considering momentum was not too bad. When I look at the one day chart it seems to me there were a couple of mini short attacks that were attempting manipulation. I could be wrong but it certainly looks pretty blatant. Boy will it be fun when they get their shorts handed to them one day!
This not a company. This a charity for CEOs private jet and lifestyle.
I?m a longtime shareholder ..I?m getting sick and tired of the Canoo employees posting on Reddit about how great a company Canoo is?..They?re starting to sound like pumpers?while the share price just erodes? There?s an old saying?#$%$ or get off the pot.?
Delusional holders with BS information. PT $5.
I can see this going to zero in a year or two.
"Interesting new developments...Apple now looking to tackle car manufacture by itselfOne source says Apple has revived its vehicle development lab that closed in 2016, one that previously housed over 1,000 Project Titan employees; the market condition is similar to when Apple entered the smartphone market with iPhone, and it is ripe for disruption."
"Super stonk, over $8 now"
"Wow, there are lot of paid pumpers for this stock, they bash any negative sentiment vehemently with out understanding where the negative sentiment coming from. This stock has extremely under performed with many lost lot of money. But these paid pumpers ( Tony friends?) bash and down vote and very active on this forum."
"Fisker dropped after confirming Uber partnership. For Canoo, expect the $6."
Nothing to see until 2023.
"Unemployment rate hits record high, tapering expected before EOY and smart money moving out from speculation. I didn't expect this to go down this quick. PT $3 ~ 4 by Q1 2022."
"I know the critics will thumb me down on this. But I see Canoo like the VW Beetle in the 1950's - a new, unique, economical design that at first is dismissed as an oddity... then slowly but surely grows in popularity and respect to eventually become a worldwide icon."
Bull trap. Sell at every pop
pops57 seconds agoReplied to a reaction$HEXO conversation@zencoolI have no idea. This company has made an art out of playing games with its shareholders.Making money selling weed is very simple. Not sure why this company takes the most complicated route.Sell a pound. Use the money to grow two ponds. Sell two pounds grow three....I made more money selling weed when I was 15 than some of these “publicly traded companies” make in a year
"Up 18% and holding.If other shorts follow through with covering, this thing could be over $10 in no time.The question is: Do the shorts feel lucky at this time?"
Just bought tons of puts. Easy money
This is a squeeze
"Company will keep growing until they get aquired for $15-30 a share, be patient and believe in the company. Tony invested 25 million of his own money in the company"
"We are continuing yesterday's afternoon momentum. We are due for a trend reversal, even if it's just a small one lol"
"Rivian ipo is equivalent to Canoo at $327 a share get ready for a 50x return!!! I bought 50,000 shares and holding on for the long hold"
Could be Appel car...
"I dont have a position here, but nice to see canoo finally see some green eh?"
This might be worth a gamble at $2 put some throw away cash at this and see what happens.
Something is up here..someone knows something.
"To paraphrase Thomas Paine: ""These are the times that try investor's souls."" With my holdings now about half their purchase price, I could get bummed like many others. But I know my paper losses shrink to insignificance compared to those of the GOEV executive team. My pain is like paper cuts compared theirs. They are super-incentivized to succeed. And since I met several team members (including Tony) and saw a dedication too intense to be questioned, I know this is not the scam some assert. So I suggest we all maintain cognitive control, let the team toil in the vineyards, and patiently wait for these full-bodied wines to mature."
"whenever theres this much dissing a stock, I say it's probably time to buy"

"Zero revenue, money running out soon. Production years away. Red ocean market with big players already dominating the market. Low IQ bagholders spreading false news. Perfect stock to invest to lose your money!"

"Why the pop? a can’t find any news, short squeeze? "
Raise your ask to 20 don’t let these guys cover so low
Well hopefully your putts don’t expire worthless I’m sitting on 3400 shares at a sweet average laughing and watching my money grow while your posting memes of lumber jacks falling trees you sir are a financial wizard
shorts are out in force after the beating they took today I'm surprised the debts haven't been called yet. I hope you boys don't get lockjaw.
"I think it is so funny that a guy posted his short position of when he bought, when he would cover thinking he had money in the bank. Hey son Karma is a son of a gun, it has now moved over your initial purchase(SHORT) price. You in the red and have milk all over your face. Shorties better cover soon. This is heading to 8 soon, then 9, then 10, then 11, then 12, then 13, and so on."
Dangum this biznatch iza crashin' Glad I bailed last week with a loss...
"Just a reminder that every large percentage move up for GOEV, The shorts and paid bashers will come out in full force and try to scare longs in GOEV. Stay strong knowing that this is a good long term investment that will move up the closer we get to Quarter 4 of 2022. Expect a pull back after this large move up but this stock will be here long term and potentially make you some good money. My advice is to stay the course and not read the message boards for the rest of the week as the shorts (Rats) will be stretching half truths and down right just being deceitful to as to not have to cover their positions. Hold fast and make the rats run for higher ground....the water is rising. GLTA"

The lowest ever. Down more to $5
Just an end of the week observation: Workhorse is seeking a higher capacity design. Canoo has the highly optimized MPDV.
"(CRAIG IRWIN - ROTH Capital)- ""One of your former employees this past couple of months went over to Apple to take a senior leadership role on Project Titan. And the same reporting that noted that, seemed to confirm reporting, I guess beginning of last year, that there might be some conversations between Canoo and Apple."" ((TONY AQUILA'S REPLY)) ""With respect to your comment on Apple, I really don't have a comment. And the reason is we just don't comment on those types of discussions. But obviously, I'm focused on deals that would be accretive long-term to the Company."""
This is from TD Waterhouse…. Based on the 2 sell side analysts who offered a 12-month price target in the last three months. Analysts predict a(n) 84.95% increase from today…FWIW
which auto company offers you a real shot to make serious money with the EV revolution? I agree not all EV start ups can be winners but my money is on Canoo. and so is the CEO's and the money of increasingly more institutions (we're at 15% now).
They are going to start pushing climate change / global warming more than ever before. This is going to fly!

"What's going on, the markets all racing upwards and this literally getting crushed today?"
Back to $7 then $6.
This company a scam.
this is a heavily shorted stock so don't listen to this nay sayers trying to drive the price down. this company has great technology. doing what they have don so far is no easy task. I only own a little bit of stock in this company and will continue to hold long term.
should tank if it can get below the $6.92 mark. I'll be covering my position around $6.75. Short 800 shares at 7.62
Goev short sellers
Canoo is up 9.48% to 6.47
I’m cashing out on Goev in 2022 buying a yacht and traveling the world  see you guys next year
"Actually my cost is about $18 but my daughter bought some at about 21. With every major auto manufacturer committed to going electric, and the many newcomers, canoo has the most elegant platform with the most flexibility! If they don’t make it as an independent company, someone has to have interest in those assetsThere has been almost no good news for this company, so when they finally have some, the stock will rocket upwards"
"Morgan Stanley got 1,514,142 shares on 8/20"
If you weren’t already holding don’t buy now. This pulls back tomorrow more than likely. 30% in a day. Congrats but never buy after a 30 bump.
Clearly thus stock is being manipulated during post and pre markets to keep it down
This is still undervalued!
They had some interesting insights about GOEV on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Let’s go!
This stonk is ready to run
Way undervalued..Im in.
@m Only problem is Geov has no product and won't have for at least 4 or 5 years. Listen to the CEO.
"This journalist from investorplace is really out to lunch:""the company has pivoted away from an innovative EV........to becoming a manufacturer of a delivery vehicle.""What's he talking about?

Also, Apple’s whole interest in EVs was apparently rooted in their admiration of the BMW i3 largely!"
cup and handle complete + squeeze happening.
Eazzzy $15 Coming. WAY undervalued.
"the intraday chart is looking good, we are going more than 20% today, and possibly +25%. Short's covering? There must be some news..."
https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210901PD210.html
"I would advise long-term (real) investors in GOEV to ignore the negative comments on this forum and consider the following: People with brainpower and proven track records like GM's Director of Advanced Design, Randy Rodriguez, and internationally renown Josette Sheeran do NOT come aboard leaky ships for a thrill ride. They, like several others, made their serious career moves to GOEV after careful deliberation and due diligence. For that, and other reasons, I continue to be confident in my investment in this company, even when the stock has been shorted down."
It’s gonna take at least $14 for me to celebrate
Pretty happy the 7$ Puts I sold got assigned this WE. More than double my position and lower my average price at $10. Already breakeven on the new shares
GOEV shorts on today's price action
Apple might buyout Goev
This will fall down to ride level soon. Mark my words.
who bought at 50$? And more important..who averaged down?
Im so proud holding this at 17$.....
"Well, took a 55% loss. Will try to regain it elsewhere. This probably won't move up anytime soon."
Woa... Up 15%. What's cooking?Is there a buyout offer?
"This will be staying $5 ~ 6 range for a year. Worst case, $4 very soon; most likely by EOY."
"I posted earlier exactly what’s happening now. They should be done manipulating or trying to short-tank this around 11am or so. Once they’re exhausted, it’ll reverse course. I’m proud of people not panic selling this morning. Sorry shorts, but you’re now on the wrong side with this one. To be honest, most of you knew it was going to happen but you shorted it deeper anyway. “Greed is good”,,, only in the movies."
Canoo 2 the  
This is a nice burn day for the shorts. Would be nice to see this continue really hard for the rest of the week and them fleeced. Give us a decent announcement Tony to throw some napalm into this fire!
$GOEV HC Wainwright & Co. initiated coverage on Canoo with a new price target (15$)
Ok...chiming in... buying cause I can weekly sell the premium and because there is a 30% short hold with minimal shares.. this is a large potential short squeeze and it is in the EV sector.. so yeah.. this jump in one day is high but it meets the needed threshold to buy.. so yep BOUGHT
Cool...https://www.autoevolution.com/news/canoo-anyroad-is-the-dream-recreational-vehicle-of-tomorrow-168292.html

This ain't no GME nor AMC. They have real business and revenue. This is just a paper company for now. $5 here we go.
I’m patiently waiting for Tony drops a bombshell news and the sp jumps over 100%.

Did anybody notice the large sell at the open this morning. This seems to be a recurring event. I posted about a similar large sell order 12 days ago on the 13th. A major player wanting out??? Perhaps taking a loss to avoid an even bigger loss? On the plus side I am only 2 cents from capital gainsville. Still just a trade in my view.

Good day for EV.Except Lucid.I’m kinda glad now that canoo put production out so far. Everyone who is trying to get production started this year can’t find supplies to accomplish in.I wonder if starting production in the Netherlands will prove advantageous?
Screwed Up This One ! Sold Last Week $6.53.Win SomeLose SomeGLTA
Now you want them to figure the rest out in a couple of years. Ain't gonna happen. Just testing the battery will take years.
Does this have any hope? I lost so much this based on initial presentation. Things have changed and not an aggressive company and EV landscape changing and technology is now kind of matured don't know if this company has any technical advantage
I see ACT expo has 0 effect.
Lucid Motors is valued at 33 billion and is only 1 year ahead of Canoo thats 20 times canoo. Canoo is such a good deal right now any hot news will spike the stock its at a bottom now
Hold on. If they live to produce these things will be a huge hit. Monster sales....if they make it.
"Well, it is a true bummer this stock is down like Rocky Balboa, but as soon as the first Canoo truck hits the pavement...its game over. What if Canoo never takes flight? It would be a real slap in the face to the small guy and gal who believed in the equality that the hope of Canoo brought to the marketplace. I still stand on big money has bought them off to delay (not end) there product line. opinion only. Its just a matter of time. Neo tanked too and stayed down for a time. crybabies everywhere, lawsuits flying around but they had a product that looked amazing and people were were destined to buy! Sound familiar? I am holding."
"Post market and pre market this stock is sinking, but during normal trading its gone up"

"What makes me sad is avg investors that are not canoo groupies think canoo is no different than RIDE or wkhs. Lucid and Fsr are better choices?

The cars are created by former bmw i3, i8 team ffs!"

Going back to $5. Mark my word.
Major problem insiders are mostly all out of the stock at this point 2 dollars really soon
Little of substance is going to happen until Q3 2022. So we will stay between 6 and 9 dollars for the time being. But Every good stock is long term.
God bless my 7$ puts got assigned and double my position and lower my cost average. Bought 5 $11C Sep 24 for the short squeeze coming
Yahoooo (finance)! We are +20%
Just dropped another 7K on GOEV!
Canoo will be positioned as a laggard once/if it successfully goes into production. There are big automakers already selling EVs. Do not expect to make profit for years from now.
ZEV has a huge deal from Berkshire. Don’t underestimate them because the price was walked back down.
"Canoo could end up like a chip make providing components for car maker, skateboard, tophat, self driving, modular options, next TESLA in the making"
It's bouncing off the major resistance on the one day chart. I bought option leaps and will buy more shorter contacts if it cracks above last months high @ 8.27. Guessing 15 by EOY but who knows
I’m hearing bankruptcy filing already started this company is in major problems
worst case scenario we trade low 6s when tapering sentiment hits. Best case scenario we x5 our money by EOY 2022
Initiating at Buy and $15 PT - HCW
Interesting day that’s for sure
did you see the photos of the MPDV at the ACT Expo? pretty slick design imo. personally I prefer the truck but I'm not a small business owner in need of a van.
Apple deal coming
Shorters love to depict Canoo's business situation 10x more dire than it is. Canoo is as of now solidly on track to produce its lifestyle vehicle by 4Q2022 but I wouldn't be surprised if the first produced cars come 2023. keep an eye out for battery supply announcement.massive potential imo.
"If you look at the job postings online they have jobs avail Germany, Michigan, Texas and Torrance they have some exciting plans I assume. Race car tech job avail too"
REMEMBER GME?
"Thumbs up if you still plan on buying a Canoo over a Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Nio, VW, Hyundai, BMW, Ford, GM, Subaru, Toyota, Honda - and when you’re done acknowledging that you still want the AWD lifestyle vehicle over all those, then do yourself a favor and calculate the average market cap for those companies"
Tony pumped the stock today they can’t have the company fold in 2021
UPS may be placing a big order!!
Market turning red soon. Tapering woes. Bearish for long time. PT EOY $4~5.
@Amy when did you start investing in Canoo?
Is this roadkill still twitchin’ ?
Great looking short here.
Canoo groupies foreva! Canoo victor!
this is going to make bold investors rich AF. I'll take my chance to be one of them.
We just hit all time low check insider holdings it’s at 2 percent at one point is was 50 percent
Finally a correction but we’re not there yet.
Now is the time to buy !
Jame needs help. I suggest to cover before you are more red at least you get some sleep at night. you can try to make money other time if you save your base
