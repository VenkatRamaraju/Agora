"At long last thanks to a COVID vaccine this company is continuing the great run it had prior to COVID and I'm finally getting rich. Patience is the name of the game folks. Don't give up and close your position before the miracle happens. If the past 7 years has taught me anything it's that great stocks always eventually come out on top no matter what, and TDY is certainly a great stock. Can't wait for this to push past 400 and then take out 500."

"TDY is a customer of LightPath (LPTH) for infrared (maybe both IR and visible light molded aspheric lenses). Nice new IR product presumably using LPTH lenses. I wonder if there's any prospect of TDY buying-out LPTH so the manufacturing would be in-house? (LPTH turned around; new CEO; making money; and has lots of new contracts in the US, Europe and even China)."
