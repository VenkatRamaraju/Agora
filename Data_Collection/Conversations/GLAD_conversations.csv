do dividends really get paid every month?
new 52 week highs the last couple of days. Suspect response to the sale of Alloy Die Casting position. Large capital gain realized.
joined yesterday for the divi!!!!
"I currently hold 3 dividend payers (SCM, PSEC, HRZN) P feel confident with SCM & HRZN but on the fence with PSEC so I'm looking for another dividend payer. As of today GLAD @9.56 is paying high 8%. Their recent qtr report sounded fairly good. Numbers aren't bad. What say you who have been here? Anything to consider, look out for? Management? Thank you."
Finally in the green for today.
Years and years of great dividends.Bought on dips and reinvested dividends.
Looking to time an entry point on GLAD. Any thoughts?

"Dividend investors generally don't like GLAD because the dividend never increases. I bought a boatload of GLAD because of the high yield of over 9%. I'm getting up in years and am not looking to have a great retirement in 20-30 years, so a low dividend yield now with hefty increases over the next 30 years doesn't appeal to me. High short term yield is what what I'm putting my $$$ into right now."
"Forward P/E - 11Price/Book 1.2Strong Buy, in my opinion"
"good earnings, no questions at conference call which is pretty unusual."
"just announced dividends for next three months, down to 0.065/share. Also announced reduction in incentive fees for themselves, although there may not be any incentive fees to earn anyway."
"Just buy now and hold. Dividends are paid out monthly, which is over 10% per year."
Per the CC they committed to monthly dividends through and including Sept. = annual divvy of ~10% at current prices. That's a huge positive.
"Bought on dips, great dividend. Long term investment."
Very good financials. Glad is moving forward at a financially secure company. I am glad I own Glad and a nice monthly dividend .
Monthly DIVs and they keep showing up on time and in good amount. Reddit users should push this one up for us then lets dump it once we are millionaires.
About to buy a small bit of this stock. Opinions? Steady earner?
look out below see massive sell off . Missed earnings targets.
I’ve been thinking about buying more stocks of GLAD lower than the original cost I paid for it. But I want to do this to add more stocks to my portfolio for the dividend payout. I’m hesitant because it doesn’t seem like a bright idea.
