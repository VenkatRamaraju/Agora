Gladstone Capital is up 5.00% to 11.54
Per the CC they committed to monthly dividends through and including Sept. = annual divvy of ~10% at current prices. That's a huge positive.

"Book value per share $7.41 at 12/17/20 with a 12 month target of $7.85 and a current closing price of $9.08.IF.....the analysts are right the 8.5% dividend won't cover the loss in share value in the next 12 months.On the other hand, they are analysts....who knows what that's worth?"
"Bought on dips, great dividend. Long term investment."
Are they issuing shares each year to keep their stock price around 10 bucks like my analysis leads me to believe?
Stay in for monthly dividend. Reinvest same to buy more shares. You can also take your check and compound it elsewhere!!

Well this gets me out! This market is not rational!!
I’ve been thinking about buying more stocks of GLAD lower than the original cost I paid for it. But I want to do this to add more stocks to my portfolio for the dividend payout. I’m hesitant because it doesn’t seem like a bright idea.

Monthly DIVs!!!
Everyone get their monthly payout today?
The dividends here are just. WOW.
Gladstone Cap reached a 52 Week low at 8.35
What is the reason for the drop ??
Monthly DIVs and they keep showing up on time and in good amount. Reddit users should push this one up for us then lets dump it once we are millionaires.
"Dividend investors generally don't like GLAD because the dividend never increases. I bought a boatload of GLAD because of the high yield of over 9%. I'm getting up in years and am not looking to have a great retirement in 20-30 years, so a low dividend yield now with hefty increases over the next 30 years doesn't appeal to me. High short term yield is what what I'm putting my $$$ into right now."
Very good financials. Glad is moving forward at a financially secure company. I am glad I own Glad and a nice monthly dividend .
should have got in months ago..dagnabit
GLADD is up 11.11% to 20.00

"I currently hold 3 dividend payers (SCM, PSEC, HRZN) P feel confident with SCM & HRZN but on the fence with PSEC so I'm looking for another dividend payer. As of today GLAD @9.56 is paying high 8%. Their recent qtr report sounded fairly good. Numbers aren't bad. What say you who have been here? Anything to consider, look out for? Management? Thank you."
