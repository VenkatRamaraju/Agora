This stock gives me heart attack everyday.
In my 35 years of investing by far the most manipulated stock I’ve ever owned
The other 2 stocks are flying and we are utmost down. Crazy?
Say hello to $500 in next week. News is out from CNBC and FDA. Full approval to Biontech vaccine on Monday. GL
Watch for GREEN on BNTX NVAX MRNA today since the profit taking is well over!
"Fellows, how do you think, will the Japanese contamination problem of MRNA going to affect BNTX on positive or negative way on Monday session?"
"Still astonished that people here still believe BNTX vaccine works... very unfortunate. If you care about your investment, look into Dr Robert Malone (mRNA inventor)... he is very concerned with the narrative media is pushing out to people regarding your vaccine."
Lower dosage could be highly beneficial for BNTX. Especially for the booster market. Why purchasing more boosters from MRNA when there is another vaccine out there which raises the antibody levels more than enough with less side effects? And together with Pfizer BNTX has the production capacity to deliver.
I see it as a good opportunity to add more shares...GLTA!
just buy and hold by next earnings we will be running up to $600 patience is the key
as usual Moderna always gets the better gains cause its #$%$ stock sigh
"It’s the reality, if one fund get out, and other funds don’t get out, the other funds will lose their profit, if I hold it long I would have gained 0% but now I have 20% just from exiting and re-enter, face the reality, many people and funds are already in this stock and the time where it steadily rise (Ex: $50-$200) is just too rare to happen"

"TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Shots from Moderna Inc's COVID-19 vaccine lot that has been halted due to a report of contamination were used at mass inoculation sites in the western prefecture of Osaka over two weeks this month, Japan's defence ministry said on Thursday.The shots were administered between Aug. 6-20, the ministry said in a statement. It did not say how many people were affected. The ministry's mass vaccination sites in Tokyo did not receive the lot in question, it said.Moderna said on Wednesday it has withheld supply of about 1.63 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan after a report of vials with particulate matter, which it suspects involves a production line in Spain."
Major contaminants such as metal particles should have been stopped at the Basic QC level. It’s a horrendous error & we wouldn’t expect this level of contamination from herbal therapy let alone an injectable therapy. If this was detected at the factory level it would be forgiven but 2 deaths THATS a gameOver!
"Top FDA officials resign. Obviously, approving the Pfizer vaccine got to them."
Healthy pause… Some might have sold some of their shares to re-deploy their money after an imminent market correction. I’m one of them.
Green long before the bell
BNTax is calming down. I like it.
"There is a truck load of media pumping Moderna stocks that’s drowning out the facts, it just makes the rebound al that much better"
Will Biontech burn red alongside Moderna due to their production tainting in Japan?It seems we are quite glued to the hips with Moderna.
"How can we be trashed while mRNA went up?? Which brand was facing an issue in Japan? This is manipulation..... our positive news didn't move the SP yet negative news on twin affect us more. The agenda is clear, we are not their favorite. This SP will move when big boys challenge big boys, hopefully at this price is attractive now."
"Do not try to play smart with BNTX. It can make you chasing the stock at a snap of finger.If you are a professional trader, you may make some quick bucks at fluctuations. But for the rest, the best play in town is to just stay invested long term and ignore these extreme fluctuations. The uptrend will not change, at least for the foreseeable long term. BNTX plus/minus 30% moves are just the norm."
"End of quarter is Sept 30, investors will be piling in, not worried."
"Booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are highly effective against both coronavirus infection and severe covid-19, Israeli scientists reported in a new paper that supports the idea of administering a third dose as protection against the virus wanes.Researchers at a variety of Israeli institutions looked at data from the nation’s Health Ministry for 1.1 million people 60 or older this month. On July 30, Israel became the first country to make booster shots available to people in that age range who had been fully vaccinated with two shots of the Pfizer vaccine at least five months earlier. The United States plans to start offering booster shots to most people Sept. 20 if the plan is approved by the Food and Drug Administration."

i bought at 345 should I sell now and buy again later your thoughts plz
Now I am really confused
Maybe if there is really bad news on BNTX Moderna will go up and BNTX along with
Everyone who has lost their shirt shorting BNTX seems to be here crying about it. There is life beyond being miserable all day long. Not expecting that they'll make better choices in their lives.

I told you to sell and buy nvax. GR8INFO4U is not your friend.
"MRNA is up on BNTX good news, BNTX is down on MRNA bad news. Strange link, any one notice that?"
"lol, seems like we will never leave MRNA alone. Hahahahahaha...TT"
What is happening ? BNTX has been down daily since Aug 23 up to today. A lot of people are short selling and taking profit ??
And everyone is saying this is a $500 stock?

"Moderna makes 49% net net profit and BNTX 52%.Beats MRNA stock by 3%.BNTX Pays 31% taxes on profits, and still comes ahead in profit.Then what on earth is this, a paradox?Noway, Moderna has an expensive way of life luxury styleSpend spend spend.The question is where or to whom ?"

"How does this rise past 400$ now, what must be done in the coming weeks and months for bntx to reach a new all time high"
BNTX will drive NVAX and MRNA higher on Monday too!!! I own all 3....
What is the rationale behind this falling? Anyone
My guess = +5% to 10% tonight!
Moderna was never been and is not now anywhere as good a company as BioNTech. The royally f'ed up their production of the vaccine and should pay the price in the market - people got killed. No matter what their HF owners flail and try to do to keep their share price up Moderna is run by imcompetents.
"Pfizer vaccine starts providing protection starting day 12 after the first shot even when there are not enough antibodies: There are other things like T cells which are not properly understood yet which play an important role in providing protection as well. In short, pfizer vaccine starts providing good degree of protection even without full vaccination."

"Reality strikes again. Both approved rMNA companies are down 25% from ATH in three weeks. No matter how you guess why, this is real. It is also unreal in the history of successful products of listed companies. Both products are successful NOW. Amazon, MSFT,Apple all proved great for investors over years. This is compressed into less than a year. Too wild to explain."
Institutional Shares has recently gone up from 15% to 18.55%.
FDA to give fully approval on Monday. Buy the dip now and thank me later.

"It is very evident Biontech is a strong company with great management, good fundamentals and good revenue.There has been nothing but good news and the securing of purchase contracts day after day by many countries.It is without a doubt that by the end of Sept, this stock will most certainly hit the range of 420-450 as a conservative estimate.Nobody can predict the shorts however, as this stock has had a trend of not showing linear increase in its SP in response to positive news.Best to not look at the SP daily. Set the value of your close positions and live your life in peace.It won't be long before getting the notification from your broker that Christmas came early for you."
Today..12:17 on Marketwatch....Pfizer-BioNTech submitting supplemental BLA for approval of COVID-19 vaccine booster
Modernas failures are biontechs gain ! No other way to put it
Q3 earnings on 11/09/21 will be astronomical!
"Lost $0.46 per share today, good lesson"
"Still trying to determine the “why’s “ of the BNTX share price. 1. There have been a series of positive facts recently that in normal listed companies would move any share price on an upward trajectory.2. There are no legitimate negative events to impact the positive facts.Yet, after a two day reaction to a blow out Q2 reveal the price heads down.3.The daily volatility is wildly high without basis..4. The share price continues to mirror MRNA and the sector.Iv been investing for some 55 years and I have significant profits here but the dislectic price movement has me baffled. I’m running out of theories."
"Profits determines the value of a company BioNTech is about to wipe the floor with Moderna due to the following:1. They will receive full paediatric approval 5-162. The results of the lyophilised trial should be released within 6-8weeks for FDA review (Yes there going to have another for more shelf stable version before Novavax has there first Version released)3. October we should see the results of how effective the Delta Booster is4, November we should get a double whammy Delta + lyophilised approval if we are lucky5. By December there should be a new circulating Virus due the velocity of mutations. However as the booster should be based on the 6 circulating mutations it should be effective for at least 6-months without the requirement of Boosters (This is speculation)6. November- China & Russia at this rage should be forced into BioNTech contracts as this stage especially id the new booster shows to provide sterilising immunity 7. USA will dump the stock pile into the lap of the UN and invoke the DPA to maximise its acquisition of the Delta/lambda booster probably forcing the EU to do similar measures and drive up the price of new delta contracts to facilitate expediency"
"News this morning. Pfizer is recruiting a large new sales division to get the booster into arms when appproved. With the recent FDA full approval direct sales to physicians, pharmacy’s and other usual point of contact delivery for Rx products will be preceded by advertising. The pricing of direct sales is expected to be far above the pandemics muted levels. This from Benzinga yesterday."
New line approved by EMA in Germany boost capacity by 410 million does & a site in France that would supply 51 million does . Also Israel is reporting boost are working .
Can BNTX recover tomorrow and may go down to $300?
Shorts are going to have a real problem there is a growing number of people who are realising that BioNTech is here to change the world. This stock is the Muhummad Ali of stocks when you think it has been beaten to the ground it’s just getting started!
May reach near new high next week - IMO
"Bntx is too cheap, comparing with MRNA。 bntx eps is double of mRNA one, but bntx sp is lower."
"Evidence is mounting that the mRNA vaccines, esp. Pfizer, are narrow in their protection against variants. A new paper (1st link in reply) on medrxiv found that Pfizer's protection against the Delta variant is weaker than natural immunity. Another paper (2nd link in reply) studied memory B cells evolution and found that there was little growth in potency or breadth against variants, again when compared to natural immunity:""These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with breadth equivalent to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals.""Results in these papers raise questions about the effectiveness of a booster shot with Pfizer or Moderna to help with new variants. Immune responses by these vaccines are too narrowly limited to the original Wuhan virus. Until vaccine goes in arms, we don't know for sure how NVAX will work out in this respect. However, data from the US phase-3 trial and the hACE2 inhibition results on slide 24 of the recent EC say that NVAX will have broader responses and hopefully broader protection against new variants.$BNTX"
Almost 10% down in the past 5 trading days. Going the wrong direction to reach $500
"Im Germany both MRNA and BNTX are going down, simply no logic...Why BNTX is connected like rubber band to MRNA? Despite all positive news are for BNTX while MRNA is going bad because of contamination problem in Japan, and still both are synced in any movement. No sense in that. Normally if your direct competitor have problems you should rise, but not in this case. Why???"
"In the past three days, the sp is up above the 20MA. A good sign for another up trend! Good luck for all of us! Go $600!!!"
$130 decline from ATH. Wow.
"Another Nation rolling out BoostersPrague (dpa) - The Czech Republic plans to start giving elderly people and those who are at risk a third vaccination against Covid-19, a government group said on Monday.Registration for the booster shots opens on September 20 and is voluntary, the group said. People may have booster shots as long as their last vaccine was at least eight months ago.The additional shot is strongly recommended for anyone aged 60 or older. Those who are eligible are to be notified by text message.The campaign is to use vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.Meanwhile, Health Minister Adam Vojtech plans to reintroduce compulsory testing for any caregivers in nursing homes and social settings who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19. The testing requirement had been lifted in early July.Vojtech said the vaccination rate in this area was not what was expected, in comments to CT radio.Just under 5.7 million of the Czech Republic's 10.7 million citizens have been fully vaccinated so far.Meanwhile tougher entry regulations entered force on Monday for tourists and travellers coming from neighbouring Germany.Anyone who has not been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks must provide a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and go into quarantine after arrival. The quarantine can end after a minimum of five days, following a second negative PCR test.Exceptions apply for commuters and people who want to make quick trips across the border, for example, for those who want to go shopping."
"If you want to load more, wait for next good 4hr chart. Yesterday, it was a start for technically nice 4hr chart. Today, it has been destroyed."

Congrats to GR8 on his buy of AC Immune at 7 a couple of weeks ago! Up over 4 points PM.
"The timeline - while restating the obvious - its important to know how far ahead PFE/BNTX is and the longer term implications - Full approval - for 16 and up - So a 2 year age advantage over Moderna - when they seek their full approvalBoosters not yet covered by the full approval but the roll out of boosters will give the mRNA companies a huge advantage on the booster market because their booster approval may come just after the like of J&J regular approval (if it comes at all)Under 12 - Pfizer/BNTX will be likely be submittting the data to the FDA in mid to late Sept- If it takes a month to grant EUA that group could be available in Late Oct - 6 months or so later PFE/BNTX could be seeking BLA for that group as well along with having already sought and obtained the 12-15 full approval.MRNA is second we will see how far behind they are But J&J is way behind - It may not get BLA til near year end. Because vaccines are typically given to otherwise healthy individuals, they are generally subject to more regulatory scrutiny than other medical products, including prescription drugs. Full approval means the Pfizer vaccine now carries the FDA’s strongest endorsement of safety and effectiveness. Public health experts hope the change will convince more unvaccinated people to get the shot and spur more employers to require vaccinations.Moderna has also applied for full approval, and Johnson & Johnson has said it hopes to apply later in the year.All during the quarter boosters will roll out - along with tackingling the remaining 79mln Americans - and now tacking the difficult anti-vaxers - Its up to each nation to go after these people. Who really should now be isolating with their decesion.Pfizer’s shot still is available for 12- to 15-year-olds under emergency use authorization. The full approval also doesn’t apply to boosters. The agency will decide separately whether an extra shot is necessary for healthy people."
"Moderna, plays a major role in the global vaccination plans. Serious production deficiencies are bound to reduce significantly people's trust in vaccines in general. What this means is that Biontech's stock price will be unquestionably impacted severely."

"The current SP weakness on light volume is nothing more than a disagreement on Booster usage.A key advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee may back a more limited approach to Covid-19 boosters than the one announced by Biden administration health officials.In a joint statement last week, the heads of federal health agencies, including the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, unveiled a plan to begin allowing all Americans to receive booster shots of the messenger RNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer (ticker: PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) the week of Sept. 20.Before that can happen, however, FDA staff must authorize booster doses of the vaccine for widespread administration, and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices must issue a recommendation. Comments by ACIP members in a meeting on Monday suggested that their go-ahead wasn't a sure thing.""Process really does matter,"" said Dr. Beth Bell, a member of ACIP and a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Washington. ""I think it's really quite important that we're continuing to highlight what our process is, and how we get to a point of making recommendations.""A presentation at the meeting made by a CDC staffer, Dr. Sara Oliver, noted that the vaccines continue to offer high protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, though protection against asymptomatic and mild infections appears to be lower.The presentation, based on the discussions of a working group, suggested that the priority should continue to be vaccination of unvaccinated people, and that the priority for a booster-dose policy should be ""prevention of severe disease in at-risk populations.""The CDC work group is discussing a booster-dose recommendation approach that targets long-term-care residents, older adults, and healthcare personnel, according to Oliver's presentation.That appears to be setting the stage for a narrower set of recommendations than Biden administration officials have been promising. ""We expect the rule will be simple,"" White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients said at a White House briefing last week. ""Get your booster shot eight months after you've got your second shot.""In a note out Tuesday morning, SVB Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch wrote that the ACIP comments should dampen near- term expectations for booster doses. ""We read this meeting timing and the additional dose ('booster') discussion as an indication that uptick in third doses may not come as rapidly as investors have been expecting,"" Graybosch wrote.In a separate note, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote that ACIP was taking a conservative approach. ""ACIP still appears to be hesitant on whether [additional] doses are needed despite waning antibodies and increasing infections,"" Yee wrote. ""We think the ACIP could be leaning toward just a narrow 3rd dose recommendation for high-risk people (healthcare workers, elderly) vs. the more blanket recommendation the White House favors.""BioNTech's (BNTX) American depository receipts dropped 3.8% on Monday, and were down another 1.2% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Moderna shares dropped 3% Monday and were up 0.9% in premarket trading Tuesday, while Pfizer shares climbed 0.3% on Monday and were down 0.1% early Tuesday.Some ACIP members were critical of the Biden administration's approach to the booster rollout. One member, Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University, said that ""many many many"" hospitals in the south had begun giving boosters to patients and healthcare workers, despite the FDA and CDC not yet signing off.""Since it was given a date, many assumed it was given a blessing by the White House, and this was the next step,"" Talbot said.Talbot said that these healthcare providers won't be covered by the PREP Act, which offers Covid-19 vaccinators immunity from liability. ""Many people did not read the fine print,"" Talbot said.In her note, Graybosch said that comments at the meeting on the question of whether PREP Act protections apply to vaccinators giving third doses before approval by the FDA and CDC would cut down on near-term demand for boosters. "" Physicians expressed their surprise"" at this point, Graybosch said, and ""we expect early boost demand will pullback until FDA / ACIP action.""In addition to the discussion of boosters, ACIP also voted to recommend Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine for people aged 16 and above, following the FDA's decision to fully approve the vaccine last week. ""If you have been waiting for this approval before getting the vaccine, now is the time to get vaccinated and join the more than 173 million Americans who are already fully vaccinated,"" the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said in a statement."

"Have no fear. This is how BNTX behave. A lot of money has taken profits and rotate out into other stocks such as NVDA AMD etc. The money pool has left so will buyers come back? Of course, but you have to wait till October November when the next block buster earnings come out. Meanwhile if you have not rotated out to maintain the velocity of your money, just have to close your eyes and don’t look."
The 6 month booster roll out and subsequent increased production means revenue will look something like this22bln 2021 - 35-45bln 202235-45bln 2023What it means is that revenue should be 50% higher in 2022 and remain their as the world rolls out a 3 dose vaccine it also means that we should have now a clear path to minimum 3 years sticky revenue.This is a super mega blockbuster drug - for at least 3 yearsNow lets see what else the company can produce during this ramp up period.

Something looks very weir since I been following the Afghanistan news past 2 weeks I saw the citizens their most of them are without masks and I never heard of the media talking about Covid there. I wonder if they are Covid free or is Covid19 a hoaxes. It doesn’t make much sense how delta is so dominant and the Afghan are running around in big crowd and no mask and also not vaccinated and no cases or death was reported while they are on the plane sitting side by side fleeing. Can anyone have any input to this?

"Tel Aviv (dpa) - Israel is allowing all citizens over the age of 12 to receive a third dose of the vaccine against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday, even as much of the planet has yet to see a first vaccination dose.""This is a privilege that no other country has,"" Bennett said, touting his country's world-leading advances in inoculating the population against the coronavirus.Israel's previous age limit for the booster vaccination was set at 30, and at least five months must have passed since the second jab. Two million Israelis out of a total of more than 9 million have already received a third vaccination dose, Bennett said. ""There are already results: The increase in severe morbidity has begun to slow.""Almost 59 per cent of the population have been given a second vaccination, almost entirely using the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.At the end of July, the country became the first in the world to begin administering a third vaccination against the coronavirus.According to Israel'sHealth Ministry, the effectiveness of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccination has declined sharply in the population since the beginning of June.At the same time, the Delta variant, which is considered particularly contagious, has been spreading rapidly in Israel."
"@ItsMeLayla, my answers to your post.1. Hiccups are common with distribution especially when reporting of the process is in real time. They have since managed to tackle it. Update yourself with the recent news. 2. Only 1.6 million affected. Japan had dismissed this as a minor problem to their vaccination effort yesterday.3. Wrong on the QC problem. FDA would not have granted them EUA if this is so. 3. Those executives have been selling since $60 but they still have a lot of stocks as annual compensation. It is extremely dishonest of you and the media to peddle this when time again SP continues to rise despite them selling it now. 4. We'll see what happens but so far the prospect for winning is not looking better for Arbutus as it was a year ago. I am not dismissing a possible Arbutus win however small but I am thinking it will be more likely a win win situation for both. I am not a lawyer but at least I know that legal issue is much more complex than what most folks on yahoo mb are suggesting.5. They are doing a trial to test a lower concentration for boosters. The higher concentration for the vaccine has its benefit as well as risk.6. Risk and benefit analysis will still show that risk for myocardial infraction from the vaccine is much lower than exposure to the virus. Remember when biontech was attacked with the same slander, that's the argument we use to defend it. It is a very fair defense for mrna vaccines now as it was then. 7. This is a sweeping statement that is difficult to comment on.As a I said many times, in the short to medium term, Biontech SP will continue to move in tandem with Moderna. Note that Bntx SP responds positively to positive news from Moderna and negatively to negative news from Moderna. Yet it is strangely insensitive to its own good news. Recall ER upbeat from 3 weeks ago? With this kind of dynamics, investors in biontech wishing bad for Moderna is like a desire to shoot one self on the foot, at least in the short term."

"Lambda variant shows vaccine resistanceThe Lambda variant of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru and now spreading in South America, is highly infectious and more resistant to vaccines than the original version of the virus the emerged from Wuhan, China, Japanese researchers have found.In laboratory experiments, they found that three mutations in Lambda's spike protein, known as RSYLTPGD246-253N, 260 L452Q and F490S, help it resist neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. Two additional mutations, T76I and L452Q, help make Lambda highly infectious, they found. In a paper posted on Wednesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review, the researchers warn that with Lambda being labeled a ""Variant of Interest"" by the World Health Organization, rather than a ""Variant of Concern,"" people might not realize it is a serious ongoing threat."

"I read and hear analyst saying: ""after the pandemic it's over for BionTech."" But they don't see that this pandemic was just BionTech's real world trial for mRNA-technology and guess what? It succeeded far better than anyone had expected: they created the #1 vaccine. Now imagine what their mRNA technology will do to all other diseases in the future. That's were your mind should be at. So I'm doubling down on BionTech since today and I'm very confident."
"It's worth mention again in case people miss it. BNTX vaccine is failing in Israel and the world against Delta. It requires boosting in 6-8 months, which is not sustainable long term. Therefore, this is not a successful vaccine. It prevents deaths but not sickness and hospitalization. Boosters shouldn't be celebrated by investors unless it's at a minimum 12-18 months. Because that's the acceptable timeframe for boosting. At 6-8 months, people will move on to something better, more durable - MRNA, NVAX, etc.""Immunity from the vaccine dips over time.Israel had fully vaccinated slightly over half its population by March 25. Infections waned, venues reopened to the vaccinated and the prime minister told Israelis to go out and have fun. By June, all restrictions, including indoor masking, were abolished.But Israel paid a price for the early rollout. Health officials, and then Pfizer, said their data showed a dip in the vaccine's protection around six months after receiving the second shot.The delta variant broke through the vaccine's waning protection.It was a perfect storm: The vaccine's waning protection came around the same time the more infectious delta variant arrived in Israel this summer. Delta accounts for nearly all infections in Israel today."""

A new BionTech product in Phase 3 would be very welcome at this point.
I’m still trying to determine why BNTX sp is still determined by Moderna. The recent Q2 results clearly put BNTX as far superior yet it clings to the Moderna sp minute by minute. I am looking to the Biotec ETFs where Moderna is the largest holding of many and BNTX is in the top 15. Can’t make the connection here but something is binding the two which makes zero sense.

"from todays Biontech PM about Brasil: “We have continuously increased the production capacities of our own plants and added dozens of production partners to our global network.

"" So you can see whats going on- calkulate longtime profits this money maschine!!"
"Longs do not fret. If we go down too much lower someone will try to buy BNTX. Market Cap is $81B. They have that much in earnings in the next 2 years. The larger pharma cos need to keep their earnings up through acquisition. so..... OR BNTX could be looking at another buy like Kite. They have and will have more tons of Cash to buy/create new things. If you believe like I do that this is a platform (mRNA) for the future, then you have to believe that BNTX and MRNA will be profitable for a very long time, and thus are good long term holds. And if you think mRNA is easy look at CureVac."

I wouldn’t approve Boosters for young people until the Delta adjusted Vaccine was available. It might increase share value in the short term BUT it would blunt the effect of the adjusted Booster and could delay the implementation by as much as 6 months. Vaccines are NOT like replacing iphones. Boosting too High or too early sacrifices specific antibodies there have numerous studies that has been shown this to be true for influenza that’s why we. Don’t give two shots in the same year despite immunity depleting.The immediate implications of this is that everybody that stockpiled will have to either sell or donate remaining supplies of the current BNT and buy the upgrade when it becomes available.This will increase the UN supplier and Expedite supply to late comers like NZ & Australia.The Delta Boosters will come at a premium and wipe out any notion that competitor products will be used as boosters as they are based on the Wuhan strain not on circulating variants.

"I was just thinking...Formal U.S approval of the Pfizer Inc(PFE) /BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine will make it nearly impossible to successfully challenge mandates by employers, legal experts said.The decision by the Food and Drug Administration to give full approval to the vaccine is ""seismic,"" said Brian Dean Abramson, an author on vaccine law.He said it will become extremely difficult to challenge the FDA's decision and the mandates that flow from it.On Monday, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine became the first to secure full FDA validation, prompting calls for governments and private employers to make the shots mandatory.COVID-19 vaccines have been available in the United States since December under the an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA.Language in the EUA law states that recipients must be informed of benefits and risks of the vaccine and given the option to accept or refuse it.That language raised some uncertainty regarding employer mandates, which are usually considered legal, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings Law. ""With full approval, that is removed.""Following the FDA announcement on Monday, CVS Health Corp(CVS) , Chevron Corp(CVX) - the second-largest U.S. oil producer - and Goldman Sachs(GS) issued mandates for some employees.Legal experts said there already was a growing consensus that employers could mandate an emergency vaccine. During the pandemic, both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice issued guidance in support of vaccine mandates, provided exceptions were made for medical conditions and religious beliefs.But emergency vaccine requirements have not gone unchallenged. At least a dozen lawsuits have been filed, mostly by students against colleges, but also by employees fighting allegations of wrongful termination for refusing a shot.Most of the cases prominently feature arguments that vaccines approved on an emergency basis could not be required, seizing on language in the emergency authorization law that requires consent from the vaccine recipient.Isaac Legaretta, for example, said he was never told he could refuse the vaccine required by the Dona Ana Detention Center in New Mexico where he worked.""Quite the opposite, he was advised that he would be fired if he did so,"" said the Legaretta lawsuit, which was filed in February and is pending.In July, in one of the few rulings involving a private employer, a federal judge in Texas upheld vaccine mandates for employees at a Houston Methodist Hospital, finding the employees misunderstood the language in the EUA law.Legal experts said challenges to vaccine mandates will almost certainly persist, particularly against public employers or public universities and colleges, which involve allegations of governments infringing on an individual's Constitutional rights. That argument does not apply to private employers.But as long as the government is requiring the vaccine as a condition of employment or education, legal experts said those will be difficult cases to make.""You can always go work for somebody else or go to a school that doesn't require a vaccine,"" said Jeffrey Nolan, an attorney with Holland & Knight, which represents employers.Many employers have tried to use incentives such as gift cards and time off to encourage vaccinations. That approach seems to have run its course, legal experts said.With full FDA approval, employers appear ready to move toward ordering staff to get vaccinated.Samantha Monsees, an attorney with Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said: ""I think based on my workload in the last two days the FDA approval is going to tip the scales with a lot of employers."""

Why are we down more than the contaminants???
Switzerland has signed an agreement with Pfizer to supply 14 million more doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to cover 2022 and 2023.7M + option for another 7M.
My Prediction for Monday is a 5% increase and we may see BioNTech overtake Moderna within the week.There is a sense of Urgency to increase shipments of BioNTech vaccines in NZ & Australia as well as other countries. With Moderna’s failures it will lead to countries turning to a more reliable supplier
"Evaluation of BioNTech.Since I last looked at it, some basic assumptions have shifted. That is why it makes sense to me to carry out a new evaluation of BioNTech. At the time, I assumed that BioNTech would sell every dose of its vaccine it produces by 2023 and then sell 1 billion doses a year. I valued the company at a $ 100-120 billion ($ 400- $ 460) share price.What's new?1) BioNTech has started a joint venture with Fosun and has entered into a partnership in South Africa2) Booster vaccinations are becoming a reality worldwide. Not only for risk groups but for large parts of the population3) Updates in the pipeline. 3 new phase II studies this year. BofA estimates 3 of them with a 50% probability of success eachHow does that work?1) In the short term - and this may come as a surprise to some - not at all. Regardless of whether a deal is reached with China or not, BioNTech is unlikely to sell one more dose until 2023. From 2023 it could be slightly reflected in the Covid area. However, both partnerships are to be seen as long-term and strategic. BioNTech has now expanded its influence to Asia + Africa.2) Booster vaccinations for everyone will increase margins in 2022 and 2023 as more doses are sold to rich countries. From 2024, more doses will also be needed for refreshments and against mutations. From 2024 there will probably be a worldwide demand for boosters of 5 billion doses (world - Russia, India & China). At the moment everything looks as if this need will be met by mRNA manufacturers. If only because the vaccine has to be adapted to mutations. First of all, I want to cautiously increase the annual consumption to 2 billion doses. The chances are good that the BioNTech vaccine will gain broader acceptance due to the lower price compared to Moderna and the global networking.3) The focus will be more and more on the pipeline. In my old models, I valued the pipeline as such at approximately $ 18 billion ($ 72 / share). After the latest study updates, the BofA comes to the conclusion that there are some very promising candidates and see the pipeline at USD 25 billion. In addition, reference is again made to the income from the flu vaccine with Pfizer and the prospect of malaria / tuberculosis vaccines.The medium and long-term perspective is becoming increasingly clear. The income for the next 3 years is already contractually fixed. The prospects beyond that - both in terms of Covid vaccines and other products - are clear to see. The medium-term income even increases due to the extended booster vaccinations and rising prices. If the market would actually recognize that and evaluate it fairly, one would have to mmn. apply a PER of 15. With an average profit of $ 15 billion USD per year (average over the next 5 years). In my opinion, a fair valuation would mean USD 225 billion (medium-term perspective 2022-2023). That's about $ 900 / share.However, I am assuming that, at least this year, many will not manage to make the leap in BioNTech to see more than just the vaccine manufacturer. If only the vaccinations and boosters and rising prices are included in the valuation and the P / E ratio remains at 10, that would be 150 billion USD market capitalization or about $ 600 / share.BioNTech is excellently positioned in the long term. The management in particular does a lot of things right in an almost frightening way and makes no mistakes. The plan of how the company should be built and what goal will be striven for was heard at the annual general meeting. From my point of view, it is more than a coincidence that a startup with mRNA technology saved the world from catastrophe and all major pharmaceutical companies have failed. The whole industry will be revolutionized by mRNA within the next 10-20 years. Probably it will benefit most of all humanity as a whole, who will get rid of some of the worst plagues. As an investor, you can participate. In the end, there is the very simple question behind it: Is BioNTech just a Covid vaccine and was that just luck? Or is there more to the company / technology? And as absurd as it may sound: The best proof from my point of view of how good BioNTech is is called Moderna. The vaccine from Moderna shows that BioNTech was not only lucky, but that mRNA technology is fast, reliable and effective. Not just with Covid. I believe that we are seeing the beginning of a new ""mega-trend"" that encompasses the entire health sector, triggered by new technologies and aging populations. But I think it's too early to stick a price tag on it. BioNTech has a good chance of using its pioneer status and becoming an important pillar"

"Since we seemingly all love to speculate on this forum, here's my ""gut"" feeling after enjoying a great Friday evening dinner with copious amounts of wine......China will find a way to approve our vaccine before the end of September.

Just my opinion.....good night."
"And I am glad that I am not living in China because the people in China cannot even choose which vaccine they wanna get. They are forced to inject domestic vaccine only.

"I find BioNTech‘s strategic approach and execution so far startling. Setting up local pertnerships and/or building factories on all continents apart from Australia (sorry Leyla).

Going after some „easier“ to reach goals (Malaria, TB, Influenza) while finding a cure for the western worlds probably most dreaded disease.

Opinions please: How will BNTX fare in case of tapering or a bear market? I assume it should be relatively safe haven in view of locked in contracts and as pharmaceuticals are generally non-cyclical stocks. Might BNTX even profit with investors moving their money to safer grounds such as BNTX?

"Horus, congrats holding NVAX, you have been around 230 since late Feb!"
"Oefffff, more bad news for Moderna, hope it will not drag us with them…"
Moderna has shown its cards They cannot produce a booster and keep there phase 1 in production at the same time as they don’t control there production line they have a over reliance in discount manufactures that have poor quality control. Under normal circumstances the factory would be forced to supply all QC records and massive fines would be issued.So see what happens to EU & Asian contracts moving forward with Moderna they may have doomed there future contracts

"Layla, pleas bestow us +10%."
Today's downturn is caused by this publication in JAMA. Antibody titer (GMT) is 1444 (a range of 1350-1544) for BNTX vs 3836 (a range of 3586-4104) for MRNA vaccine. Obvious it implies BNTX vaccine is not as strong.
"BioNTech is undervalued, Moderna is overvalued, Novavax is worth zero."
"Marketwatch does not mention how much BNTX share price has soared this year, while it mentions MRNA, JNJ, Pfizer in the article about Moderna's BLA submission. Keeping Biontech in the corner, under the radar from mainstream reporting: ""The announcement comes two days after the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. PFE, -2.08% and partner BioNTech SE BNTX, 0.67% received the FDA's full approval, while Moderna's vaccine is currently granted emergency use authorization, as is Johnson & Johnson's JNJ, -0.51% vaccine. Moderna's stock has soared 293.1% year to date, while shares of Pfizer have climbed 28.5% and J&J have gained 10.7%. The S&P 500 SPX, 0.09% has advanced 19.5% this year."""
"Year end TP. BNTX is $520. and MRNA's is $300.On time span of 8 month basis current MRNA price sb. $200.00 and BNTX where it is now. $345-$350.I guess the analyst of BAC was right, though a little or more than a little over reacted.MRNA next year earnings and sales will be toast. BNTX will get a sales growth of 20% will be reflected in price.You know what happens to a stock price if the next year sales/earnings is less to the currnt one ? Stock price will dive down to reflect the new value based on to reflecting the unhappier and leaner results......Looking around for numbers and getting them down on paper this is my forecast.BNTX is a power house comparing to MRNA with the generous spending which are included to Moderna's financial reports, perhaps, to lure her suiters ????? or perhaps to honour unnamed debts."
"IMO.... reason for China not yet giving green light to Fosun partly due to Full approval from FDA and the other reason could be they prefer most of their people have gotten their local vaccine jab first. China intention was clear, using Bntx as booster jab rather than 1&2 dose. That 1billion production capacity allows them to market it to HK, Taiwan and Macau. So this early approval might be good news for Fosun thus good news for Bntx too."
This isn't that difficult. Take your BNTX profits and go long on NVAX. Before NVAX gets really expensive.

"Moderna PR machine is working in full force. We already knew that moderna vaccine produces more antibodies. The dosage is 3 times more, what else could happen? More antibodies does not mean better efficacy. We also knew the vaccine increases myocarditis risk. That’s also not news.

I already got rid of half of my shares above 400. Now I started to regret not getting rid of all of them."

If you bought high, have patience, you will get your money back plus some if you are patient. If you can afford it, cost average to a lower price. This is one of the best/easiest decisions I have ever made investing in this company."
This is a friendly reminder for you all. NQ Biotech was falling short term. Monday will be a crucial indication of whether BNTX will be treated as an independent entity with its own valuation. Be careful.

Moderna's vaccine production has never been as robust as the Pfizer-BioNTech partnership's production. Moderna is reaching to try to keep up with the production of the market leader. Moderna will continue to stumble because they are scientists and operational/logistical dunces. Pfizer has experience and experience matters.

"Goodbye Moderna - Hello Pfizer BioNtech -This is the old breakdown of Supply for Japan, any major revision will hit the Bottom Line for Moderna and effect there future production capacity.Japan, Pfizer making deal for 120 million 'booster' third vaccines in 2022August 17, 2021 (Mainichi Japan)Japanese versionSyringes for coronavirus vaccinations are seen. (Mainichi/Koichiro Tezuka)TOKYO -- The Japanese government and U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer have reportedly broadly agreed to a contract supplying an additional 120 million doses of the latter's coronavirus vaccine in 2022, as part of efforts to administer ""booster"" third doses, it was learned on Aug. 16.Moves to maintain immunity with a third shot among people who have already received two are expanding mainly in developed nations. The Japanese government has also begun investigations into giving medical professionals and elderly people third doses upon completion of their second shots.Vaccines currently in use in Japan are thought to provide adequate immunity after two doses. But due to factors including lack of clarity on the duration of vaccines' ability to prevent developing COVID-19 and serious cases of the disease, and the emergence of the more infectious delta variant, more figures within the government are of the view that a ""booster"" additional immunity-strengthening vaccination is necessary.As part of next year's vaccine supplies, the government has already signed an additional procurement contract with U.S.-based Moderna and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., which handles domestic supplies of Moderna's vaccines, for 50 million doses. With the 120 million more doses from Pfizer, Japan could secure a total of 170 million vaccines for 2022, which would amply cover the people's needs for third shots."
"If the stock is undervalued as most of us here tend to believe, why no one wants to buy more when it is 9% down? It is not a sarcastic one."
"Full FDA approval for $BNTX is a big deal because it shows that FDA has analysed 9 months’ of real world data about vaccine safety and efficacy and concluded that it is safe and it works. This will put to bed all speculation about safety and efficacy arising out of various studies that keep popping up. The amount of data that FDA would have studied in its analysis dwarfs any other studies conducted here and there. The only reason $BNTX price dropped suddenly and substantially after spectacular Q2 results is doubt about vaccine efficacy created by these studies. All such doubt should now disappear. Most analysts have raised the price target to $430-450, and many believe that the fair value is $600+. Time for the market to get moving. $BNTX investors, HODL! Do not sell a single share till we cross $450."
The playing field in the market is rigged against bntx right nowAll it takes is for one big investor/move than we will rocket
"News about mRNA vaccines technologyas a whole affect both BNTX and Moderna in the same direction: FDA approvals, booster shots neeeds, etc. News from bad production and bad Quality control of Moderna are different: they will push BNTX SP up.The direct competion is Moderna as other vaccines are second tier and not a preference for boosters.BNTX price up!"
People who buy on Margin are panic sellers. It’s a never a good idea as you double down when stock prices drop.

I have my friends and colleagues telling me to sell and I stun them every time when I say that every time it drops I buy MORE!
"No worries. Low volume, SP down, weak hands are gone. Sale forecast is still intact..."
"We should be over 450 IMHO. We appear pegged to Moderna price-wise because some institution that owns both companies is influencing the shares this way. It's unlikely a MM algorithm would cause this as both companies are very very different in every conceivable respect. The offending institution's logic might be that we all are part of some mRNA index or sector, but their valuations are flawed. The bottom line is that we simply need either much more institutional ownership, or a share buy back. We wouldn't completely decouple from Moderna's daily movements, but we would be closer to a fair value while doing so. Just my observation, right or wrong."
"If I am BNTX CEO, it will spread the news on its QC in the internet and send letters of assurance to every customer. This is a golden time to #$%$ another piece of pie from MRNA. The latest news on twitter is the deal in AU, and SA. You are so NOBLE!"
