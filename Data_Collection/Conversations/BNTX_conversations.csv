"$VALN $PFE Pfizer will take over. It has already invested $10 million in Lyme disease and is about to launch it jointly. $BNTX COVID-19 vaccine is being supplied worldwide, but side effects are increasing and Pfizer is looking for an alternative vaccine as it is being used as a water vaccine for delta mutation."
Now I am really confused
"We are like Siamese Twins with mRNA... dropped 10.00 both of us. Unfortunately, we don't go up as much when they do."
Just look at openinsider and search for MRNA.Do I have to say more?
"Still trying to determine the “why’s “ of the BNTX share price. 1. There have been a series of positive facts recently that in normal listed companies would move any share price on an upward trajectory.2. There are no legitimate negative events to impact the positive facts.Yet, after a two day reaction to a blow out Q2 reveal the price heads down.3.The daily volatility is wildly high without basis..4. The share price continues to mirror MRNA and the sector.Iv been investing for some 55 years and I have significant profits here but the dislectic price movement has me baffled. I’m running out of theories."
"One thing is for sure: covid becomes an Endemic. But what blows my mind is their pipeline - if they manage to create another successful mRNA treatment, it will be ..wow..just wow."
"FYI - For those wanting to know how many shares are short - Its reported as 2,073,039 or 0.86% by Bofa.This is nothing so Please dont say shorts are out to get you. Before even concocting a theory of shorts try and short the stock yourself - go ahead see how hard it is to borrow and see how much it costs you in terms of capital requirment."
"Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be approved for children by early winter.Gottlieb, who is on Pfizer's board of directors, said the company ""could be in a position"" to file an application as early as October, setting up an early winter approval."
"Year end TP. BNTX is $520. and MRNA's is $300.On time span of 8 month basis current MRNA price sb. $200.00 and BNTX where it is now. $345-$350.I guess the analyst of BAC was right, though a little or more than a little over reacted.MRNA next year earnings and sales will be toast. BNTX will get a sales growth of 20% will be reflected in price.You know what happens to a stock price if the next year sales/earnings is less to the currnt one ? Stock price will dive down to reflect the new value based on to reflecting the unhappier and leaner results......Looking around for numbers and getting them down on paper this is my forecast.BNTX is a power house comparing to MRNA with the generous spending which are included to Moderna's financial reports, perhaps, to lure her suiters ????? or perhaps to honour unnamed debts."
WHY this DOWN to $350 in PM
Why are we down more than the contaminants???
"Profits determines the value of a company BioNTech is about to wipe the floor with Moderna due to the following:1. They will receive full paediatric approval 5-162. The results of the lyophilised trial should be released within 6-8weeks for FDA review (Yes there going to have another for more shelf stable version before Novavax has there first Version released)3. October we should see the results of how effective the Delta Booster is4, November we should get a double whammy Delta + lyophilised approval if we are lucky5. By December there should be a new circulating Virus due the velocity of mutations. However as the booster should be based on the 6 circulating mutations it should be effective for at least 6-months without the requirement of Boosters (This is speculation)6. November- China & Russia at this rage should be forced into BioNTech contracts as this stage especially id the new booster shows to provide sterilising immunity 7. USA will dump the stock pile into the lap of the UN and invoke the DPA to maximise its acquisition of the Delta/lambda booster probably forcing the EU to do similar measures and drive up the price of new delta contracts to facilitate expediency"
"Dr. Scott Gottlieb expects U.S. drug regulators to clear the Pfizer Covid vaccine for emergency use in children ages 5 to 11 in late fall or early winter this year.The former FDA chief and current Pfizer board member told CNBC that such a timeline represents an “optimized scenario.”Spread of the delta variant may potentially pressure regulators to act more quickly, he suggested."
Moderna made a very costly error this is what happened to Volkswagen Volkswagen's chief executive was under withering pressure Monday as an emissions-testing scandal erased more than 13 billion euros (around $15 billion) from the company's market value in a single trading session.
What the. Bad news for Moderna and Biontech gets dragged down as well??
"so instead of getting dragged down by mrna we are actually pulled up by it, who would have thought..."
Why BNTX is down more than MRNA??
"Good news for you guys, it dropped below 50 MA not much and showed support in 4hr chart, meaning correction is more than half way.Choose one thing: trader or investor.For a trader, BNTX is close to heaven with such volatility. For a investor, a great stock, 100 at this year's March."
"What are some reasons this stock can sink below $320, and what are some reasons that can shoot it up past $400?Genuinely asking because the SP does not seem to correspond directly to news unlike other stocks."
"End of quarter is Sept 30, investors will be piling in, not worried."
Possible inverse cup and handle on the daily chart today
Almost 10% down in the past 5 trading days. Going the wrong direction to reach $500
"TAIPEI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of major Apple Inc supplier Foxconn, has asked BioNTech SE to reserve 30 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine for Taiwan, saying he had received a ""very good"" response."
"we all know the effectiveness of this vaccine, thats why we bought it. So, Don't worry"
"The CDC advisory committee is meeting today to discuss the need for boosters, that’s probably playing a part in today’s price action"
Okinawa prefecture in Japan found metal contaminants in Moderna covid19 vaccines. This batch of vaccines is different from the batch of 1.63 million doses suspended earlier. Okinawa has discontinued use of moderna vaccines.
6!x3!
"Ship is about to his the Fan for Moderna BRUSSELS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday it was investigating a contamination incident in the manufacturing of Moderna (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccines to assess whether there was an impact on EU supply."
I should've sold bntx along with mrna at the highest point
lets hope MRNA has good news so that BNTX also goes up.
"3!X6!A “doomsday” Covid variant has been detected in South Africa – and there are warnings it is worse than the Delta variant.A new preprint study by South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases warns the new variant has “mutated substantially” and is more mutations away from the original virus detected in Wuhan than any other variant previously detected.The new variant, known as C. 1.2, first emerged in South Africa but has also been detected in England, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, New Zealand, Portugal and Switzerland."
"It's unhealthy to look at this stock daily. Investment 101: only buy shares from a worthwhile company.Anyone who has purchased this stock should remember why they did so - the company has strong fundamentals, high potential for growth and development, and nothing short of positive news.Be confident that it will rise in due time."
"News this morning. Pfizer is recruiting a large new sales division to get the booster into arms when appproved. With the recent FDA full approval direct sales to physicians, pharmacy’s and other usual point of contact delivery for Rx products will be preceded by advertising. The pricing of direct sales is expected to be far above the pandemics muted levels. This from Benzinga yesterday."
in a one..month 475
"Moderna makes 49% net net profit and BNTX 52%.Beats MRNA stock by 3%.BNTX Pays 31% taxes on profits, and still comes ahead in profit.Then what on earth is this, a paradox?Noway, Moderna has an expensive way of life luxury styleSpend spend spend.The question is where or to whom ?"
"Why would you mute me, when I am trying to help you. Sell BNTX and purchase NVAX."
"wow @GR8INFO4U, just look at that disparity between bntx and nvax today. what do you think is going on here?"
"MRNA is up on BNTX good news, BNTX is down on MRNA bad news. Strange link, any one notice that?"

"Im Germany both MRNA and BNTX are going down, simply no logic...Why BNTX is connected like rubber band to MRNA? Despite all positive news are for BNTX while MRNA is going bad because of contamination problem in Japan, and still both are synced in any movement. No sense in that. Normally if your direct competitor have problems you should rise, but not in this case. Why???"
