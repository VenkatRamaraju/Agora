"Any long time holders want to comment? I've been watching this stock for a few months, and wondering if it's now a value play. From $300 to $100 certainly isn't a good trend."
I wish I didn't place a stop loss at 85:(( My broker sold those shares when there was a massive sell off on the whole market
Well she is up a bit. They filed with SEC on spin off ... could be in as little as 30 days ... hard to say ... any thoughts on how they will trade post spin? Gotta believe there is 10% upside to date of spin distribution.
Alliance Data Systems is down 4.99% to 89.55
Nice comeback today gang.Will we see $50 this week?
"ADS worth $100+ no matter stock action On a technical basis, the stock is retracing some of the the recent gains. However on a fundamental basis, the company should post $14+ in EPS over the next 12 months, and is selling at a measly 5 PE going forward. An 8 PE going forward would take the stock to $112"

"Analysts raised targets last week to $100+ I think they owe it to shareholders to come out and defend the stock. Morgan Stanley raised to $115,Oppenheimer to $95"
What a great report. Still trading with LYLT attached. I figure LYLT worth at least $4.75. $4.47 QEPS combined is $17.88 Annualized. Just starting down growth path anew. Huge earnings leverage. 10% AR growth will produce north of $22 EPS at 15 that's $330 Target with some PE expansion.
"99% of the people posting here do not understand what the company does to make money. No clue.Do you know almost all the airline and hotel loyalty rewards programs are handled by this company? And you know the hotel and airline industry is down 80-90%. And this company also does royalty programs with the retailers like Macys, Pottery Barn, J Crew, Pier1 , etc. All the retail companies are being hammered ad they furloughed almost all their workers until the Summer. So, this stock can actually fall to $10 by the summer.In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million. The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports."
Thot the stock will go up with the sale as ADS will now have $ to repay debt. This stock valuation is beyond my understanding...

What is happening?
Is this thing being manipulated to capture LYLT shares? How is 4.5X earnings even possible with growth in place? WTMF?
"I missed the boat last quarter, but I won't miss it today. I am in from before earnings and after earnings"
"I bought in previously at $45, and I'll keep averaging down each dollar it goes below $45."

Need to see some loan growth. When will FISERV deal start the push?
"As I discussed in Warp Investor, the fair value here is likely around $156. No one can predict the future, of course. But possibly a lot of upside. The company is currently valued as if there will be little to no growth going forward. The reason for this is that some of the retailers that ADS works with are having serious problems, even though ADS also has partnerships with retailers that are doing quite well."
"if you base your investment decision on Zack's, you'd do a lot better just buying a CD. they are just noise. I don't know why they existed."
Looks like EPS .81 adjusted 1.86Rev 979 Net 38.4Market seems to like.
Have a hard time figuring out why this is trading the way it does? No position but it is crazy the way this is trading when it as $20 EPS and almost $4 billion in cash.
I like this stock... great outlook 
All over the map now.Perfect flipper for another week or so.With decent earnings should easily go back to upper $50's.Right now just playing the swings
Alliance Data Systems is down 5.14% to 96.72

"I have this one in one of my accounts that I don't use much. I don't even remember when I bought it but in my brokerage account shows down around 50%. Did this company buy a Canadian company or maybe change names? I was trying to look up and see it bought LoyaltyOne but I don't know if that was a public company as can't seem to find info on that. I will look into it more but thought maybe someone else who ended up with this stock after a merger might know :) It isn't very large position, only 14 shares. I normally wouldn't by an odd number like that so guessing went through some splits or something."

ADS needs to stop taking out new debt and pay down what they already have. There is no reason to pay out dividends when their Debt load is so outrageously large. So omit the dividend and start paying down the debt now!
"Good luck to all the longs, I have had a nice run with ADS but I believe my money is better suited elsewhere. Thank you for the grains"
Bout Time!
Should I sell or hold?? Elections has been historically bad for stocks.
People have slept on this one. My personal PT at $195. Been holding HUUUUUUGE since $55
"such a hidden gem, I bought in at $30, added more at 43"
why has this stock fallen so far from its 52 week at 187?? seems way over sold or??? thanks
"ADS can't rally no matter the earnings I don't get why. I mean Morgan Stanley has a $100+ price target, and according to Yahoo Finance the average price target is around $87. I am stumped as to why ADS sell for only a 5 PE going forward !"
A great moment to pick a stock before the report and spin - off!
"I sold out today, couldn’t afford what seems like daily $10 dollar drops. Now that I sold this is probably near a floor. Down over 50% just in the last month. Never will understand how this got beaten up so much."
