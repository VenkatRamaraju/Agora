I like this stock... great outlook 
Somebody is manipulating this stock downwards.
"I missed the boat last quarter, but I won't miss it today. I am in from before earnings and after earnings"
Nice run; Still think 130-150$ share is fair value. Holding strong.
Don’t be surprised to see this filing for bankruptcy soon

Bought a bit more at 83.77 . Waiting for 90+

"In about 3 weeks, all the major retailers, travel agencies, hotels, airlines announce earnings. After these announcements, ADS will most likely drop to $10 level. Let's see what happens about April 22nd."

This may be a good company to get into for the long haul. But I think there is a possibility of it dropping further in about a month. We are probably near the lows so I may consider buying now.
Nice firm and nice price.

"They have more in cash than market value, and they are profitable. What is going on."
All over the map now.Perfect flipper for another week or so.With decent earnings should easily go back to upper $50's.Right now just playing the swings
Have a hard time figuring out why this is trading the way it does? No position but it is crazy the way this is trading when it as $20 EPS and almost $4 billion in cash.
Very nice and timely announcement from management for current situation.

"ADS IS LYING AND NOT TAKING RESERVES. It is almost fraud not taking reserves for the lifetime risk of the loan under CECL regulatory requirements. How come Capital One declares a loss in Q1’20 earning release while ADS had positive earnings even though ADS has much more riskier portfolio than Capital One. ADS portfolio is including almost completely private label and co-branded retail branded cards, which are all struggling. Their cards do not have utility when the retailers are closed.At the second quarter of 2020, ADS will have to take enormous reserves and will blame it to the deteriorating economy as if they did not know that fact when they were preparing the first quarter earning release. ADS will make big loss with its huge sub-prime private label portfolio in Q2’2020. Their balance sheet is in trouble with limited liquidity and their accounting discipline is absolutely flawed (nice way of saying it). If they declare big loss before regulators catch their move, they would be lucky! ADS only took $300MM incremental reserves for their $18B card portfolio because of COVID-19 while they were one month into COVID situation where the jobless claims had hit ~20MM. ADS will be in trouble! Watch out!"
How will ADS do now if retail becomes more obsolete? I'm just curious
This stock literally is priced by the amount of sales are made. During a time like this people may either sighn up for things or be more frugal. Short term may be low but long term will be good. Hmmm.. been watching for a while now. Still like it. But hm..

How is this going up? The way they generate revenue is all down. I actually was going to go long this stock. May have to buy in sooner than expected. Was hoping to buy in the 20s
Made it back to 40s faster than anticipated...nice! Been locking profits 30s and now 40s. Possible up to 50s...reload on meaningful pullbacks...enjoy!

Undervalued once the economy opens back up. I thought ADS would do good since they collect data. I guess they havent successfully online retailing. In person transactions will go up again. But they're going to need to transition into future means of transaction and data collecting. Still bullish but I'm willing to pull out if no sighns of a successful adaptation occurs. Still bullish though.
is it a long term good investment? anyone?!
buy big
Time to head on back up again!
What is happening?
I would sell it. People do not understand the numbers who buy it. The reality will set in. With decreasing revenues and increasing losses it will be perfect storm and ADS will tank!! for loosing money!

Then FDIC comes and takes them into the custody....Where are those risk management geniuses and executiveS who made tones of money to destroy the stake holder’s equity? Where are those irresponsible guys?"

"I invest in stocks and I invest in companies that I have good experiences. A few years ago, I signed up for a Visa card with a hospitality company and it is co branded by Comenity, a company owned by ADS. My April bill was fully paid and my new May bill shows no new purchases but had a late fee and a finance charge so I promptly call to reverse the charge. They claimed they receive the payment a day late and I owed them the late fee and $2 in finance charge. I escalated it to a supervisor and Randy said he could not reverse the charge since they did a reversal more than a year ago and it is their policy. I called because on principle I feel that it should be waived and I am writing here because I sent the payment way before it is due. There is a lot of legal stuff on the bill but no contact for conflict resolution. I am not blaming the pandemic for the delay at USPS. I have multiple cards with different financial institutions and this is sad for a billion dollar company, treating customers like this. Anyone else had a bad experience with Comenity? God Bless and stay well."

Their losses are skyrocketing.Wait and see for the next earnings release, ADS will give everyone payment holiday to make the losses look lower. Even that is wrong!

Why the heck is the stock price going down when the earnings is so good and dividends are introduced
The stock is a sinking ship. Going down to a drain.
"During the Credit recession of 2008 and 2009, Alliance Data ran a number of programs that in a large part saved a number of major retailers. You can read this in the mentions in earning reports of a number of public companies from that time. The question is does Alliance have anyone with the knowledge of what to do this time around. I doubt it. The knowledge to do what was done in 2008 and 2009 was generated in a 20 weeks series of marketing tests ran in Pittsburgh PA at the stores of Lerner (New York & Co) in 1994. While that was long ago the concept of Marginal Utility and hence buying decisions is still valid and the core of all selling to consumers. ADS had a slogan Know More , Sell More. There was at one time truth behind that slogan!"
"As I discussed in Warp Investor, the fair value here is likely around $156. No one can predict the future, of course. But possibly a lot of upside. The company is currently valued as if there will be little to no growth going forward. The reason for this is that some of the retailers that ADS works with are having serious problems, even though ADS also has partnerships with retailers that are doing quite well."

So, this stock can actually fall to $10 by the summer.In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.
