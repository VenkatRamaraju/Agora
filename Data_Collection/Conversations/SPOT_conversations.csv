"With 184 million shares outstanding, this implies an approximate market value of between $37-$41 billion, far higher than its last reported valuation of $19 billion."
this company has a great future and the stock is so cheap
Up and above let’s go!!
"I have been watching this stock for a while and now it has come to a very bullish position! It has immense support at $215 area and it is severely oversold right now. Just bought 10,000 today at a bargain price. It will surely reach $270 within 3-4 weeks! The option movement also shows that there is a bullish movement being set up"
$FDX $SPOT under $200 soon !
$SPOT losing so much here....
400 dollar stock
"Options options, and options. Sell off starts next week."

Nice price to buy
"Spotify Analyst Sees More Downside Risk After Earnings SelloffBy Ryan Vlastelica(Bloomberg) -- Spotify Technology, which is down nearly 40% from a February peak, likely has additional downside potential, according to Wells Fargo Securities. The firm reiterates its underweight rating.Analyst Steven Cahall has a $200 price target on the stock, which implies a drop of 12.5% from its most recent closeIn the wake of the audio-streaming company’s results, “consensus remains too optimistic, plus growth should come from less profitable markets,” Wells writesSPOT’s aspiration of 1 billion monthly active users “is more in-question than it was prior, and MAU growth will need to improve for the stock to work”While the stock is “a less attractive underweight than before” the selloff, it’s not yet time to turn more positiveSeparately, KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote that based on a 6-K filing, Spotify’s average revenue per user “is no longer facing plan mix headwinds and [foreign exchange] headwinds are moderating”The filing also suggests that engagement is increasing, and that “management’s experimentation with promotional strategies does appear to be translating toward greater efficiencies”SPOT shares up 1% premarketNOTE: July 29, Spotify Upgraded at Both Guggenheim and UBS After Results (1)"
Next support is 200 and 160
Can someone explain why stock buybacks are a good thing? Thanks.
Technically this is very very oversold and should pop anytime soon. I believe it is because of the market being so unstable that it also is trading lower. But this should move up to $250 region within next month. RSI is at 27… let that sink in and anytime this stock’s RSI has gone below 29 it immediately pops off within a week or two.
This ain’t funny anymore bears!
This company is incredibly undervalued. SPOT is the future of the media entertainment space
Bought options yesterday thinking it has bottomed. Haha lost 50% fml
Will they ever make a profit ?
I started my adding at $211. Who knows where bottom is but I’ll keep adding at $10 increments down to $180.
"I think this company could honesty be the major multimedia platform of the future. First music and podcasts/radio, then videos and movies, then social media. The sky’s the limit if they offer an uncensored alternative to big tech! That’s my thesis after seeing what’s happening with Rogan as well as their initial and continuing mission to bypass the big record labels. I’ll hold this for life until I don’t believe in the thesis anymore or I feel it attains it and has become way overvalued."
"check out TME as well guys!Tencent owns 57.4% of TME, also the parent companie of TME, which means TME is a super safe invest, you can see how tencent is cooperate with other music companie to open up roads for TME, and TME already owns 85% off chinese music industry.PAG Capital Limited owns 9.1%Spotify owns 8.4%and alot institution owns this stock, make sure you know that this is some real good stuff, and you should buy and hold, safe and nice. Spot has 50B market cap, and Tme only has 27b, it should be much higher, look at the earnings, but they are not getting enough attention, but is a good time now, cause china has overcome virus really well and economy is recovering, people are looking more into chinese stocks, so TME as a safe music industry invest, Buy and hold for long, gl everyone, see you at 30."
Why does this get rocked so much
"$U and $SPOT are 2 stocks I don't worry about, I just keep steadily increasing my position on down days. I believe both products are the future and are great selections for high-growth stocks. They are far from making a profit, because they continue to improve their product. Comparing to other high-growth stocks I believe these two are at great value right now."

Take it easy and read the report. The numbers are absolutely fine. Look at the Gross Margin growth from 25% to 28%. We're good ;)
This is way oversold haha
I was hoping for an opening in 100-125 range. Saw the opening at 166 and my reaction was. - You must be kidding me.
Should be more like $32 BUCKS....
"Street remains positive on $SPOT and looking past the MAU miss. Even JPM's note below applies a 3x 2023 P/S which we touch near bottom of forward P/S ratio for $SPOT since its IPO. Post start of COVID it has traded between 4-6x.Pandemic Drag on Users, But Improving into 3Q & We're Encouraged by Ad Strength & Broader Audio Oppy; Remain OW, $280 PT?Price (27 Jul 21): $236.93Price Target (Dec-22): $280.00Prior (Dec-21): Key Takeaways from SPOT Earnings & Calls with Management: Soft 2Q MAUs as COVID Impact Continues, but User Growth Better into 3Q. SPOT reported MAUs of 365M, ~4.5M lower than the mid-point of the 366M-373M guide. With SPOT pausing marketing campaigns in certain geos due to rising COVID-19 cases, 1M of MAU shortfall came from lack of advertising in India, while pauses in Brazil &parts of SE Asia likely drove further MAU shortfall. Additionally, an email verification change drove a sign-up issue, creating another one-time 1-2M MAU shortfall. Overall, mgmt clarified that COVID-19 impacts remain a mixed bag, w/the pandemic initially driving outsized sign-ups & pulling forward int?l expansion, but recently creating MAU weakness as renewed pandemic restrictions decrease mobility & SPOT faces tough Y/Y comps. However, mgmt highlighted the leading indicators of MAU growth are back on track and expects MAUs to beat the two-year avg growth rate. Down the funnel, strength in the US & EU drove Premium Subs to 165M(+20%Y/Y), and ARPU was flat FXN Y/Y. Looking forward, we model 3Q MAUs of 380M (guide = 377M-382M)& Premium subs of 172M (170M-174Mguide). We model 3Q Premium ARPU of #$%$4.25 (+1% FXN Y/Y) and expect product/geo mix to offset price increase benefits, driving ?21 Premium ARPU of #$%$4.41(+4% FXN Y/Y). Strong Podcast Ad Demand & Industry Backdrop; Narrative Shifting to Broader Audio Opportunity. SPOT reported 2Q revenue of #$%$2.3B, inline with our estimates, including outperformance in both the music & podcast ad business. Podcast revs grew +627%Y/Y(+700% FXN Y/Y)& 200% FXN Y/Y on an organic basis as consumption trends remained strong. Overall, Ad revenues grew 126% FXN Y/Y (106% FXN Y/Y on an organic basis), driven by better-than-expected sell-through rates & lower CPMs. We are encouraged by mgmt?s commentary that podcast supply remains the constraint & demand remains strong, & we expect Ad revs momentum to persist as SPOT unlocks incremental podcast ad inventory. For 3Q, we model Ad revenue of #$%$290M (+55% FXN Y/Y). Outside podcasts, mgmt reiterated the broader Audio market(~$300B TAM by 2030)remains its focus.? Revenue Mix Shift Drives Outsized Profit Growth; Expect Marketing to Ramp in 2H. SPOT reported GM of 26.5% (ex 1x benefit of #$%$45M), driven by favorable revs mix-shift towards podcasts, 2SMP, & cost efficiencies. Operating profit of #$%$12M benefited from a one-time up lift & delay of marketing campaigns. We model 3 Q GM of 25.5% (24.4%-26.4%guide) & 3Q operating loss of (#$%$25M), driven by ramping podcast content investments in 2H.Despite recent MAU choppiness, we are encouraged by improving trends into 2H, along with ad strength & the broader Audio platform opportunity.

Very strong day. I think/hope a 215+ close is coming and then 220s tomorrow.
"SPOT is basically NFLX for music and podcasting. Like NFLX, they are now also producing their own Podcast shows to offset royalties they have to pay for music to be played on SPOT. 3-5 years, the stock will be worth $1k and you'll wonder why you didn't put some of your hard earned money to work."
$240 coming next week. Still have my $215 average. I like this one.
$SPOT $VENA It's evident in the daily chart. Not in yet but will be ready
Most of the recent drop can be attributed to Tencent’s problems. SPOT owns between 10-15 percent of Tencent Music and also has other partnerships with the company.
"here we go again, up and down. Spot is really testing your patience."
"Essentially this is the biggest thorn (platform) in big techs side. Facebook would love to buy them out... Merge with Insta and make a tik tok killer . Keep strong, the user base on spotify is unreal and growing large. will be a titan."

this thing goes down pretty much every day. -25% ytd in huge bull market...#$%$
Spotify is punished for owning a stake at Tencent. There is no other reason why this is trading so low.
Why would COVID negatively affect the quarter? Wouldn’t it help?
kept buying. now I'm thankful 
SPOT + FBTheir free plans will be more of an income generator as FB integrates with SPOT.
Lol 132 yea right
Hmmm.. What is happening?Why it dropped over 5% without any news?
Expecting big things from this tomorrow. Picked up 100 shares at $234.5 today.
Looks like it’s gonna close at low. Will add at $210. Hope it doesn’t get there.
"The low point after q1 earnings came at $210 on 5/19, about 3 weeks after earnings. I have been holding my powder to add to this 3 weeks after q2 earnings. That will be sometime next week. I don’t expect it to drop to $180 but that would be the same percentage drop as q1 post earnings sell off."
Spotify is currently the leader in the field. Far exceeding other services subscribers. I will slowly buy the dips and accumulate my position.
$PYPL $SPOT Enjoy the ride..Up & Down we Go!! Where it stops nobody knows! $WIMI 
What's going on with this ship !! It's tanking down.
What happened?!
I was WRONG. STRONG close for this today. Hopefully will build on this tomorrow.
Huge over reaction though
"Monday, October 1, 2018: Mark your calendars 'cause it's D-Day for Spotify as the lockup period for Tencent Holding's 13.5 million shares ends on 9/30/18. If Tencent sells a chunk (very likely) or half of them (like Sony did), $SPOT will be down for the count..."
I didn’t want to be right on this one but I have been right on this one. Same exact pattern as post q1 earnings. Low then was reached 3 weeks post report. That is next week.
Anyone else buying pre market? $202-203 range. May be a short term mistake but this has got to run up at some point. It’s too strong a company.
I can finally buy some $SPOT stock. Way oversold. I love the company.
TME !!!! The best you can buy it now I think!!! I my opinion!!!
Opened too high I think. Momentum is down.
SPOT won't stop climbing till 300+
BUY at $5
"Love, Love, Love $SPOT. Started with disrupting the music streaming industry, now moving onto podcasts, which are huge among younger people. I would love if they added audiobooks and competed with Audible, Scribd, etc. but we will see. For younger investors, if you want exposure to the future of entertainment, buy $SPOT and $NFLX. Both the music and movie/show entertainment will be covered."
Collapse to double digits. Free music service is coming.
watch them just be sand bagging for ER and it does great after ER. plus we haven't even had a ER run up. Once they raise guidance this can start making its way back to 300 and upgrades will come back.
Keep selling guys 
"What do you think about earnings, I think they are not that bad."
"Remember these four analysts that gave spotify stock BUY rating1. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney : $220 price target, “representing 70%+ upside2. MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson3. James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities 4. CordwellThey all collude with Spotify insiders and we should never trust these names with these agencies"

This stock should be double the price of pandora $10 that’s it
Spot is a current and future beast who will be making loads of profit within 1-2 years. Patience on this one.
has never made a dime....
"I don't get the growth valuations at times. SPOT has a market cap greater than companies such as Kroger, Hershey, Ingersoll-Rand, Sprint, Brown Forman, Cummins Engine, Hilton, Clorox, NetApp, Autozone, Regions Bank, and W.W. Grainger to name a few. Liabilities are 10X net worth, tangible net worth is negative, and the company has lost $3.6 billion since inception."
Why would this ever be down on this report? Everything is good
reports earnings may 2nd. any thoughts on which way the price will swing?
"My worst performer, still holding though"
How does SPOT make money? Slide from music subscription and services?
$216 would be a good start for another peak. Fingers crossed.
Good luck lads I have sold my option so will be bouncing from here
spot can increase rev by increasing 5% on premium fee. That shall boost more upward estimation. 29% active user growth is the base for lots of opportunities.
"An avid Spotify user myself, I've had shares in this company since their IPO and this is the first time I'm in the green. I stayed long because I believed in their product, their podcasts are way easier to access than iTunes, and their CEO has a strong vision for the company. Finally glad to see my patience rewarded!"

Bad stock right now. But that’s an opportunity. Another new 52 week low today. Will add at $200/190/180. $215 average for me now w 105 shares.
any news?
Hard to gauge if this is a good price or not. Going to keep trying to figure it out.
"Just hold, the global trend in music streaming will continue"
Spotify Technology is up 4.95% to 215.23
Actually added a bit near the low today. So brought my average to just under 230. I have way too much of this right now but I think we get a nice bounce over the next two days. It started this afternoon as we closed 8 dollars higher than lows of day. Good luck.

"Raymond James shrugs off ad-revenue concerns at SpotifySpotify (NYSE:SPOT) has fallen 0.9% after an earnings report that saw subscriber growth but disappointed some observers with its ad-supported revenues.Raymond James is unconcerned, though, with analyst Justin Patterson reiterating a Strong Buy, noting the dip in ad support is more than made up for by ""winning back churned listeners and less ARPU pressure from product mix.""The ad-supported revenue isn't a structural challenge, he says. ""Core subscriber trends remain fine and the improved user experience is driving better engagement."" (h/t Bloomberg)He has a price target of $172, now implying 25.5% upside from $137."

"I am a long term bulk here. Only thing I will say negatively is that the hype to dollar ratio for podcasting is insane. It’s such a tiny total ad market even in 5 year forecasts AND people can and do skip most ads on podcasts. So I think Spot is overdoing it with the rogan, call her daddy, etc. acquisitions."
More than a few SPOT executives are browsing the the pages of Yachting Magazine right now.
Cracking results chaps.. buying the dip today
Joe Rogan alone is worth 100 million with over 200 millions downloads. Soon all the top podcasters will be Joining the list and Spotify will become the Netflix of podcasts.
I can't explain why SPOT is up over $55 in a couple of weeks. The market is crazy.

"My guess is, when Feds are announcing tapering which wouldn’t probably affect a lot on music industry, people still sell these stocks because music is bad?Sometimes, it’s very confusing."
they just announced a 1B stock repurchase
This is not even close to the lowest since June of last year. It was 210 only a few months ago - a bit after last earnings report.
"Yeah this stock will never trade right. Still trades like some 20x Revenue speculative stock. Spotify is not going to grow at 100% rates ever. Its mature in a lot of ways, and has a huge and steadily growing user base. How much would a company realistically need to pay for the users, engagement, UI, software, data, and moat that Spotify has? I guarantee you more than $50bn. A company is worth what you would pay for it, and an Apple, Amazon, Google would have to pay a heck of a lot more than this to acquire SPOT. If they could get it for $50bn they would do it today, but it’s simply worth much more than that in the long run so I would hold until the market sees the value."
"I think they will beat earnings estimates because during q1 one of the main reasons why the missed earnings was the high share for wage compensation, this q the share price is so much lower, this must be a significant advantage for earnings. But I also think that the only important metric of q2 will be subscriber growth, they must keep this high."
Same exact thing happened in May. If Nasdaq pulls back a bit this will slide under $200 quickly. Good opportunity for long term holders. I’ll be adding starting at $210.
How does everyone not see this as a huge discount and free money buying this??
Mind boggling this stock. Should literally be $500 today
"Puts on 210, crocs will try to bring it lower for tomorrow. Next week we gonna be back to 230 easy, buy the dip."
Most frustrating stock to own. Should be at $500
I'm totally buying this at $3.50 a share!
"I don’t understand the volatility in this stock. It trades like it’s a crazy valuation of a emerging company. Spotify is a lot of ways is mature (with plenty of growth to come). But with hundreds of millions of users it’s not like they are proving themselves in the market.And we all know profitability is overrated. If Spotify really wanted to change the model to be profitable they would, but they are focused on growth and fending off Apple which is the true way to build shareholders value over the next ten years.Anyway I don’t see this turning into a $200Bn company overnight. But I think it will steadily climb it’s way there."
How does anyone justify a valuation at these levels and think it should go higher? Free Cash Flow of roughly 200 million and a 48 billion valuation? Stock should trade under 100.
This stock exemplifies a common market problem of no fundamentals supporting valuations. Be cautious.

"New to the SPOT today 700 shares @133. In because Gimlet is solid we used it for B2B content programs served up to our F500 engineering customers for education programs & certification podcasts. Only game in town for musics for Milennials and my kids. Lastly I am a big Youtuber and was very easy to upsell me to their YT Red subscription(commercial free and it stays playing when I switch applications on phone). Pls notice that all things even newspapers are charging and if their content is good we will finally ""pony-up"". Bottom line many will never pay but a larger and larger % WILL over time especially if indispensable to your trade(trading, engineering, legal, tech, consulting and any other high knowledge employees) and Gimlet is the new play there. Netflix of a blossoming audio content world. GL to all and look fwd to exchange with you all in future."
"No sarcasm intended , but has this company ever made a profit ?"
This board is so bearish. Great product. Feel like a buying opportunity soon.

a year of gains wiped out. How frustrating
This thing is going to rocket AH. This is a well oiled machine with terrible competition and multiple revenue streams. Loaded this AM at $234.
New 52 week low just hit. If it breaks below 210 we may freefall. I will be buying. Good luck.
"Never stop falling, will buy at $180"
"I have never shorted a stock in my life, but if I did, this would be the first."
$Siri will catch up with $Spot
Expect this to drop more today. $210 likely. I will start adding then but once that is breached then $200/190/180 can come fast. I will hold a long time though so that is Okc.
Looks like fade to close coming again.

"HAHAHAA. I own $TME but comparing the two is ridiculous. Apples to oranges bro. SPOT is a podcast leader, content creator, and #1 music streamer in the world. Can't stop won't stop $500 a share all day baby."

"This is going down, subscriptions are declining fast. I've cancelled mine 3 months ago, and their new AD system makes it unbearable for free users to even attempt to listen to a single song. Sell."
Daily chart show head and shoulder pattern
I might buy into this AFTER the 50% correction.
Been watching this stock for a while now and finally decided to jump in today!
Spotify is definitely not understood by wall street yet. This could honestly double instantly almost. Even if this tripled the valuation wouldnt be that crazy imo.
I think everyone that buys shares should receive paper certificates.THEN people can buy and sell their certificates online via eBay or whatever. then we will see the real value of these stocks. Get rid of the middleman wall street broker. PLUS more companies should sell shares directly to the public. I will give you 70/share for your SPOT.
how volatile this stock is. Everybody is playing it $SPOT $VENA

"Macquarie ResearchSpotify Technology (SPOT US)Another MAU miss with firming fundamentalsKey points: ? Q2 was soft on MAUs but strong everywhere else; guidance is mostly positive.? Advertising esp. on podcasts could propel Spotify to profitability next year.? Reiterate Outperform, we lower our target price to $350. Soft MAUs but strong fundamentals? Spotify again reported a light MAU quarter but with strong fundamentals. MAUs of 365m missed FactSet consensus 370mwhile premium subs of 166m hit. Revs came in slightly above our est while OI of #$%$12m beat our (-#$%$56m) and EPS of (-#$%$0.19) beat our (-#$%$0.25). Guidance implies >400m MAUs by year end with ~20% rev growth.Premium subs, podcasts, and advertising are all bright spots? The MAU miss was mainly driven by a one-time email verification issue with a third party (now resolved) that led to 1-2m fewer MAUs than expected. Without this, the company would have hit its prior MAU guidance range. Spotify also cut back on marketing in countries affected by the pandemic (e.g., India), which affected sign-ups. Mgmt also acknowledged difficulty in forecasting YoY. But it noted premium subs were still strong, especially in N. America and Europe, and still sees a global TAM of 1bn users.? Advertising, especially on podcasts, was again a bright spot in the quarter. Advertising revenues grew 126% organic thanks to the early success of its Audience Network, which allows advertisers to connect with Spotify listeners on and off the platform, and helped the company increase its monetizable podcast inventory by nearly 3x in the US. Mgmt sees advertising becoming a more meaningful portion of revs (just ~10% now). Podcast revs grew >600% incl acquisitions and 200% organic with the number of podcasts on the platform now at 2.9m, up from 2.6m in Q1. We think podcast advertising could be a key gross margin driver vs. music, which could ultimately propel Spotify to profitability sooner than expected. We discussed multiple paths to profitability (ads, pricing, Marketplace) in our note ?Rocking on to profitability by 2022?.Earnings and target price revision? We temper our sub numbers but raise rev and OI ests, pushing our ?21E EPS from (#$%$1.00) to (#$%$0.95). We again see profitability by ?22Eand raise EPS from (#$%$0.20) to #$%$0.04. However, we lower our TP from $400 to $350 based on 5x ?22E sales, down from 6x given the MAU underperformance. Though SPOT currently trades at just 3x ?22E sales, MAU figures need to improve to drive sentiment.Price catalyst? 12-month price target: US$350.00based on a EV/Sales methodology.? Catalyst: Q3 earnings, any product enhancement/updates.Action and recommendation? It was again the MAUs that drove negative sentiment in the stock today, but we like the rev and earnings progression and see multiple ways to get to profitability.? Risks include slowing user growth and macro uncertainty."
Rogan has the Midas touch. I am switching from Apple Music to Spotify solely because of him and I believe many others will do the same
Thanks Joe Rogan. Finally back to my purchase price and now the ascendancy of a great company.

46% down from its high…
I must admit thia is nice as a $160 start price. A lot of room until this losses 90% of its valuation. Below $20 in 6 months.
This is going to be big for Spotify. You will be able to listen to the podcast on Spotify for free. Spotify will have ads in the video stream the same way YouTube does. Spotify will make money of the ads. If you don't see the impact for the company moving forward you are blind. Spotify will use this as the foundation to grow is video streaming platform. More podcasters and content creators will jump exclusively to Spotify.
This stock is worth less that $17 usd a share
$SPOT is a $300 stock. I don't care what noise comes out from where. $300 a share is the value and I ain't selling until it's back to $300.

When Spotify decides to directly sign artists they’ll change the market.
215. Not huge movement. But Today is big. Closing near highs and strong movement since beginning of day.
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"Idly wondering if Spotify will ever launch a standalone podcast app. My Apple app was flaking out earlier today and I tried using Spotify, but found it difficult to find what I wanted because it was mixed in with the music search results."
the 2.5% off the top is pretty nice as a new shareholder.. but what's better is management's confidence on cash flow. Music+ JRE are the draws to Spotify and the podcasts with integrated ads will be the cash cow 
"One of the most underrated stocks in the market rn, taking this time to load up on this. Wall street definitely doesn’t like this stock right now. But this is forsure a 10x within 5+ years"
Anyone know why the huge drop??
This stock only goes down
$FDBL nice new Music app. Wonder if it will ever run like $SPOT ?
"There are projects in Blockchain that go from the mother to these companies, you have to be careful, they are very ambitious and beneficial projects for artists"
"Typical of SPOT. Very little coverage. One is left guessing, but there seems to be some reason why it is tanking"
"Can we take second to acknowledge the pricing power Spotify has? US Family plan price is increasing by $1, a few plans in UK increasing as well. I’m still keeping premium and I’m sure most everyone will. I’d still be willing to pay a lot more as the company raises plan prices in the future, if for no other reason than how much I use it. A higher price is more than justified for such a huge catalogue of ad-free audio content with unlimited hours is streaming. Thoughts?"
Is anyone knowledgeable about Spotify’s podcast strategy? Are any of the acquisitions going to create exclusive content?
"EPS 0.38 (+$600M/year), Market share 80% (CHINA!), $4B cash, FLOAT 600M shares ($3.5B), $SPOT, $UMG, TENCENT HOLDINGS owning >50%"
SPOTIFY IS LITERALLY ON SALE. Buy as much as you can
"Redburns downgraded Spotify. Thanks, I will buy the dip."
"What does everyone think about the stock buyback? It’s great that management thinks the stock is cheap, but why not use that billion to acquire more exclusive content?"
Spotify never fail to disappoint me

$TWLO $SPOT $WIMI Today was the first exciting day in a while. If it goes up tomorrow…that’ll be an interesting change
"Icymi Citi cuts Spotify to Sell with no benefit Citi analyst Jason Bazinet downgraded Spotify Technology (SPOT) to Sell from Neutral with a $310 price target. Among the four subscription based stocks, Spotify, Roku (ROKU), Netflix (NFLX) and SiriusXM (SIRI), Spotify is the only company where the Street's long-terms forecasts ""do not comport to the prevailing valuation,"" Bazinet tells investors in a research note. The analyst suspects ""this disconnect stems from recent enthusiasm around Spotify's recent podcast pivot."" However, its premium gross additions through Q3 and app download data through Q4 do not show any material benefit from recent podcast investments, says Bazinet. As such, the analyst downgrades Spotify to Sell."
$NVDA $SPOT $WIMI every day we are closer to the moass I feel like we are closer than we think
Breakout on high volume which means more room to run.
i have a buy at 32 dollars.... no takers?
"Nobody is paying for SPOT it's a free music streaming service, just listen to 30 mins of ads LOL"
"Strange how much this has been moving sideways, it’s gonna run up soon I know it"
"what's the p/e? oh wait, you need some e first"
Why is this dropping? Anyone give me the coles notes on this puppy?

"The result isn’t that bad, but almost drop 10%?!"
it is time to buy!
seems a good time to load up! hard to see much more downside compared to upside potential from here
"$SPOT is a $500 stock all day every day. 50% off bargain right now. When you're presented with a deal, take the deal. Don't be that guy. GLTA!!!"
What I dislike is Michael Burry stirring the pot in particular times like this.Despite the fact that it wouldn’t make a lot of impact in a long run but some people react to superficial information.
soon to 50s
Institutional ownership represents 77.16%1064 total1005 long only24 short only35 long/shortIgnore the paid bots. This numbers look terrific.
They lose money every Q and they are projected to keep losing into the future. What the heck are they doing buying back shares. Crazies at the top.
no profits it is a good time to take profits.
I feel like I should buy 100 shares of this today
"I think Microsoft and Spotify belong together. That being said , MSFT doesn't have a music company do they? not sure. Anyways I think the buyout all cash deal will benefit MSFT in a very big way.I don't see what Spotify can do here to out do its competition, like Apple , Google, Amazon. AD, best of luck"
And now we rise. Slower and more painful than I thought but yesterday was critical. 220+ likely today
This is really worth $500. It’s like a 50% discount. Just keep buying Spotify
Way over sold - I love it 
Learned my lesson from snap. This is way too high.
