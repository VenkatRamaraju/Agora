"I understand $SPOT's interest with podcasts as they are much easier to enter private labeling, but it is time to step up and make a big movement to buy big music labels."
Record high gross margin and no profit after years....what is going on
Still trying to tell people they hack you on Spotify. Happensd first hand and there is no customer service department. Had to cancel through my bank
This is a $500 stock
"$RNCH should start drilling in a few days, plus they just announced an agreement with $SPOT to use AI tech to provide ""smart targets"" for the drill program. Excited to see what they bring us in the future!https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/100520/GoldSpot-Discoveries-Engaged-by-Ranchero-Gold-to-Apply-AI-on-the-Santa-Daniela-Project-in-Sonora-Mexico"

"Keybanc Upgrades Spotify Technology to Overweight, Announces $340 Price Target"
Niver in market history a super growth stock traded at depressed price/sales 4...Sooner or later Price/sale ratios will expand...target $385
"Just hold, the global trend in music streaming will continue"
Spotify Technology is up 6.72% to 269.15
"I don't know if this marketing hiring spree is a good or a bad sign. At one hand I think okay it's good that they will further exploit the non-paying subscribers with extra adds. But at the other hand I think that timing of this announcement, just before q3, could indicate q3 earnings are disappointing and management is looking for ways too increase earnings."
As a shareholder but mostly as a subscriber of Spotify I see zero innovation. Is there anything in the pipeline?
target $385==buy any weakness!
Target $385 raised today!
it seem August 17 was all time low then rise up 250 in august 31 then dropped to $221 in Oct 4 then rise back to $250...This pretty much apply to many stocks almost have similar chart/pattern. I think ER going down . I would say back to $220 then down to $180
any thought about q3?
It so funny how Americans underestimate this stock. In Europe spotify have most of market share and Apple Music is not real competition. Always each non-us stock have some discount in it. If this would be us stock we would be already around 100bln market cap.
Spotify Technology is up 4.93% to 286.60
+10% today at least
Revenue was at high end of guidance. And on track for over 400M MAUs.

$TWLO $SPOT $WIMI Swag. Early stages of this move still. Of course will be some volatility but we have a number of upcoming catalystsSwag.
like if you think they will beat earnings and dislike if you think they will miss.
New Target $40 after ATH on $UMG & $SPOT
SPOT Price/ sales trades like steel sector only 4: SNOW 40x sales; SHOP 30x sales...
They will report on WED. Firms will upgrade . price target $300
Hmmm...negative earnings TWICE what was expected and stock goes UP because company says things will be better 4th Quarter. When will company actually make a profit and start paying off debt? Pump and dump.
Spotify is punished for owning a stake at Tencent. There is no other reason why this is trading so low.
SPOT P/Rev is the lowest among super growth stocksAggressive buy!
The buyback didnt do so much
Sell or hold? Is this ever gonna go up TT
DA Davidson raises PT to $344 from $324Truist securities raises 300 from 270JP Morgan raises 325 from 280Goldman Sachs raises 280 from 260Morgan Stanley raises 350 from 325UBS raises 275 from 240Keybanc raises 365 from 340Pivotal raises 385 from 300maybe I’ll hang around for a little longer. GenZs command the future in music streaming and this is where its at. But I’m biased; been a user since Beta testing in NA.
"Listen to Daniel Ek on the Invest Like The Best podcast. His vision for the future of audio is compelling. For example, if a TikTok influencer plays a song in the background of their vid, rather than the influencer being forced to seek permission from the label or face a DMCA notice, Spotify can help them insert it seamlessly while paying royalties to the artist and label. Spotify is still in the early innings of innovating new distribution methods."
SELL.......t24-Sep-21 DZ Bank Initiated Sell $20013-Sep-21 Goldman Initiated Neutral $26
What's the consensus on $SPOT climbing prior to earnings on the 27th? I think we'll see $260s before earnings. What do ya'll think? Hopefully $300 after earnings??
500 dollar stock
"Spotify is solidly profitable and we’re still in the early innings of audio moving online. Spotify, Amazon, and Apple aren’t competing with each other. They’re taking market share from terrestrial radio. What do you think the TAM is for terrestrial radio? That should be your starting point but even that doesn’t take into consideration the value of higher margin growth opportunities like podcasts, live audio, and nascent token-based economics which will flip the legacy artist/label distribution model on its head."
"There are projects in Blockchain that go from the mother to these companies, you have to be careful, they are very ambitious and beneficial projects for artists"
"EPS 0.38 (+$600M/year), Market share 80% (CHINA!), $4B cash, FLOAT 600M shares ($3.5B), $SPOT, $UMG, TENCENT HOLDINGS owning >50%"
Feeling 300 by winter
