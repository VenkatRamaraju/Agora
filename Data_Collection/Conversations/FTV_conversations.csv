"This post from 3 years ago says it all: ""FTV reached a new All Time High at 79.62"" Today it is up to $74.12. So shareholders have lost $5.50/share (minus miniscule dividend) over 3 years. How can anyone be thrilled about this stock."

FTV reached a new All Time High at 79.62
All time high....
Good day today.....Must be good news from the investor conference today
"Can someone explain why the big drop today. Increased earnings on reduced revenues is a good thing, isnt it?"
"From today's conference call: James A. Lico, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are pleased to announce our fourth quarter results which represented a strong finish to 2020. This performance highlighted the benefits of our transformation efforts and demonstrated the increased resilience of our portfolio. In addition to a 19% year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted net earnings per share, we saw continued sequential improvement in top-line performance resulting in total revenue growth of 4.9%, which was above the high end of our guidance, and a return to positive core growth. Through the application of the Fortive Business System, we also drove strong core operating margin expansion and a 39% year-over-year increase in free cash flow.”"
"restructuring ongoing, should be a good sign. The guys know what they are doing!!"
Hard to understand why down 2% on positive earnings and forecast..any thoughts?
It's no fluke this company is doing so well----effective management.
"FTV going through separation. It historically is a good sign for stock price. ....look at latest separation of DHR / NVST, previous of FTV / AIMC and the DHR / FTV... what the stock prices did those times.... I own this stock..."
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
So far the restructuring with Altra seems to have had a negative effect on share price. Im surprised that those who didnt tender up shares in the swap got nothing but decreased share value.
"This stock performance has been a major disappointment, Share price is approx where it was when initially issued. By comparison, EMR which has lagged FTV stock price in past is now $16/share higher. Glad I didnt pay for FTV shares ( DHR convert). DHR continues to fill our pockets. Guess I understand why they spun off this turd."
FTV will drop 7.2% after earnings reported . Let’s see how I do when I don’t have skin in the game.
"I predict that Fortive will acquire all of Altra within 3-5 years after, product rationalization/consolidation has occurred."
"As Artificial Intelligence expands into more industrial applications, FTV's area of expertise will expand. It's no ""Fluke"" the company has very effective management."
"Great results!! Jim, we want to start seeing it on the SP, finally!!!"
"forward guidance is very slow, margin is very high"
Anyone understands the restructuring that will take place this month on the 25th?
