This stock still pays dividends? Yahoo does not indicate it.
Wow down $9. What happened?
A true gift anything under $175

GD has been an awesome performer since Nov 2020. Just awesome!
This is depressing! I was waiting until end of day to check if it had picked up because there is usually more trading in the afternoon for this stock. But it’s still down with an excellent earnings report and increased backlog! They should start building Gulfstream jets that crash on their own and combat vehicles that drive around in circles nonstop so their stock price stops going boeign...boeign...boeign down!
Acting strange after earnings. Were is the bottom and is this drop justified.? I keep averaging down but starting to get annoyed.
LMT got sanctioned by China - Don't know what China do? LMT has no business with China right?Will it affect GD in any way?

Market is tanking “Stable Genius”. What’s the plan?
General Dynamics reached a 52 Week high at 208.60
GD just got another contract. This should be a $175 stock at a minimum
I get the feeling that today's drop has more to do with Raytheon earnings than anything else. What happens if it beats? GD will go higher with the rest of the gang. Let's see what happens...
GD is way oversold trading below it's support level. I am adding more at $136.61!
"let me explain.. GD is mostly traded by institutional investors. it goes in big blocks, not continuous small trades. slow to react so small guy can benefit if they are patient."
A good trade from 166 to 170.Solid company

$ analysts upgrade to strong buy in Oct
GD is investing in plant. It appears orders are increasing.
"$GD stock going to fly up tomorrow, I think. It can’t be that in this mess with Iran and with the military contracts $GD secured at the end of the year, that this stock could be going down as it did today. I think big money brought it down today and big money will allow it to rise to where it should be now that the’ve filled up their coffers"
General Dynamics Mission Systems Receives $731.8M Contract for Next-Generation Satellite Communications Systemyet the stock trades lower?? rough
"PE Around 10. That would be appropriate for a company banging out pencils. Considering backlog and growth, even with a dormant Gulfstream, should be around 16. HUGE potential here. In a few months this price will look silly, and it does already."
"Defense cotract backlogs does not depend on virus. lol, buy while it is so cheap. ETF has throw the baby with the bath water"
"GD should advance in this geopolitical climate. Currently lagging behind the other big defense names, but hopefully for not long."
"""Climb Big D climb!!"" Sorry I was watching Hunt for Red October."

wouldn't this company benefit from the recent submarine contract. Does GD have oversight of the Electric Boat company?
"9.5 Billion Columbia class (Ballistic Missile Sub) Contract awarded to Electric Boat & no mention or uptick, Strange???Contract just for the 1st two of 12 planned ships, EB to hire 18K workers over 10 years. Nice addition to a great portfolio of the GD subsidiary."
"great company, it is unfortunate that the other defense names have outshined GD but we will have our day! The only thing the dems and republicans can agree on is defense spending"
"Good morning! It’s a tremendous time to invest in many stocks, but GD has to be in top 10. Excellent management, value-friendly PE ratio and juicy consistent dividends. Don’t trust yahoo dividend N/A, here’s the facts: “The board of directors of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share on the company's common stock, payable August 7, 2020, to shareholders of record on July 3, 2020.”"
"I can't believe I'm saying this but as I look at the weekly charts I think there is more downside ahead for at least the next couple of weeks. 20 day MA is now headed down and that usually doesn't turn on a dime so I am not adding here!!! I just said it...I don't want to buy GD at the current, ridiculously low, level. I will however be selling shares of other positions in a cash build effort to swoop in and grab some in the 115/sh or so area. It looks to be headed there next week. Just what I'm seeing....B"
Why doesn’t Yahoo list GD’s dividend? It’s about 2.5%.
why dis the div yield not show. its been this way for years it seems. I know its currently 3.1%
Wow almost at a new 52 week low. Wow!! Time to add
"This is coming back. Good Earnings, Great Profit, Good Margins, Soft Outlook only on Margins. Just wait a week and it will be in the $180+"
start buying calls
"Berns is out, budget is safe, and this doesn’t pop?"
back to 180's in no time. just sayin
General Dynamics reached a 52 Week low at 137.99
GD is up 4.91% to 217.66
It's the black magic that lowering the price again.
GD will fare well long term
gd is a $180 stock...EZ. PE should be 18 no problem
Why this company going down even got a huge new contract? I don't understand...
"as I said, GD worth 170 MINIMUM. probably north of 225 if we look past 2021."
"Looks like 200 day is about $174 and if it gets through that looks like support about $170-171, after that the low $160’s. Anyone else have thoughts on entry point?"
Best time to buy defense stocks is when they're out of favor... GD's business is no different now than it was when trading at $230 in 2018. I'd say it's out of favor.
added more at 185.99 bargain prices.
GD posted an 8% increase in revenue for fourth quarter 2017 - http://alph.st/b96879fc
Why wouldn't GD be down?14% improvement on EPS compared to same quarter of 2018. Revenue up 3.2 billion compared to 2018. $80+ billion backlog.And why wouldn't Boeing be up? Nothing wrong over there...
Outlook and back-log 'pretty solid' through 2020. Wish I looked at it when it dipped!
Everybody touting their preferred sites makes not want to know. What is tour opinion.
GD got 22 billion navy contract. why doesn't this stock shoot up?

LMT GD 
"Buying around 40 shares tomorrow. With the Job’s report I’m looking at futures, they likely take a breather from the killer week. Watched this stock fly up from $147 to $155 and twiddled thumbs waiting on this T stock I bought few days ago to flip for few bucks. Taking this $6300 @ 9:30 an buying looks like 40.5 shares. With the juicy dividend + safe it’s a win win. I was making a few moves last few months and couldn’t get the cash for a true long position, now tomorrow after something came up and reminded me buy in! This is a $170+ stock all these contracts they just secured! Not that I want unrest but it comes no matter, the defense costs plenty to maintain + stay a step ahead if anything. I know this is like some PeP I grabbed other day as well, a strong  long position that will give nothing but green for foreseeable. I got  as my main holding w $170 CSA lovin life. The stocks I’m lookin for now are buy + forgets, people here seem to like GD an the research I’ve done it’s a winner. I was worried about the Boeing mess an aerospace in general for a while. I saw Space Force created but not much news. The SpaceX got me going again and I’m just going to take the leap. Any position after March sell off and reality check, nothing I buy is 5 years or less holdings. I pick some steady eddys I make my few dollars on flipping around but chunks of cash I’m placing in long term bets. Everybody here seems happy, any real downsides to owning? I mean every stock has its eh moments. Just curious cause I’m going regardless, but like to be realistic + see stocks for full glory . Bullish on GD, $170 stock price soon."
"CAT falls way short and only loses $1+, when GD Beat and down $3+. The crazy world of wall street."
finally! i have been losing my but on this. Where is the exit however. Warren buffet complains about non income producing assets and i now agree with him. But how did he value silver in the 90s then when he 1/5 of all of it?
who thinks this is a good buy???
I sold at $160 after getting in at $144. Great few weeks but I will look to buy back cheaper. Rotation back in tech.
Nobody seems to like this stock even after it beat earnings. All other industrials doing well today except GD.
Buck and a half! alright!
iron works new contract ... destroyer ships made again .. good news for gd
The only military stock in my port. Doing great
why is he dividend yield not shown?I have never seen it listed on Yahoo finance???
lets just skip the 170's all together and get back to 180 nowl
This very rich arab posted on his insta story that he owns a #$%$ton of GD because ''Rumor is they will get a contract from the US Military for the replacement of the current assault rifles they use''. Anyone heard about this' could it be true??
"Was in at $187 and this one has been a drag on my whole portfolio. Hoping earning will change that, up I'll be happy just to get back to even."
Those shares in the 120s are looking pretty nice right about now!!!
shes going up now....
"hmmm 190 is bear territory , buying hat is coming on , overreacted no need for 20 % drop from 52 high."
"Oh, seems like good news here Fri 10:05 a.m. Navy Contract. Doesn't sound like negative news."
Great quarter on what were otherwise considered very challenging comps. Much more constructive tone entering Q2 than it was back in Jan/Feb. The tick -up in backlog indicates a stabling global economy.
"Does this typically runup to the earnings, just started a position...thanks for any info."
nice dividend paid... going up too! OK. Lets get back to 180+
Buying call options now. Earnings were fantastic and outlook is strong

"Nice pre-earnings bullish bump today, should be interesting pre-market tomorrow."
Decided to buy at $187.45. It may go lower but a year from now this stock will be a lot higher.

Why paying GD CEO getting paid $18+ millions where 30 million Americans are unemployed now ???
I'm surprised LMT news hasn't moved this more. Sounds like the pentagon is a blank check money printing machine.
"Well, I have a position in GD and am getting a bit annoyed at how the market is exploding higher and GD is just inching along. But then I remind myself that I have a fantastic company in GD that is locked in for the long haul. GD EB just got a contract for an amount that is a number that I am not even confident saying in some social situations. All I can say is that when you are able to say what part of a Trillion the contract is worth, you know the company will be doing just fine for years to come. Really, the only thing holding the stock down is what everyone gives the credit to when it flies and that is GS. Personally, I think GS will print money once businesses start operating normally again. What company executive is going to want to fly commercial again?? No thanks, let's buy a Gulf Stream!!"
"Earnings up, stock down, what gives?"
north Korea is toast.gd stock is going to exploded.
what's up with the dividend? Was it suspended? Can't find anything about in the news but it's marked as NA on Yahoo Finance
"Well, that was fun while it lasted. Just hope it closes up."

"if you are novice to military research, then sit on the bench. for those that understand you should take a closer look at this stock"
General Dynamics reached a 52 Week low at 127.01
"The Defense sector as a whole is out of favor right now. The wide moat players like LMT, GD, RTX and a few others have a lot of upside ahead with fairly limited risk in my opinion."
Is this CRSA buy going to add to GD's net?
They had contract with Italia. Short term is not good but long term should be fine .
anyone buying at $196 today?
"As we prep for the week I find myself looking at GD and I am really surprised it is still sitting at 190/sh. That said, looking at the weekly candle chart GD looks ready to move higher. It consolidated the move up over the last 6 weeks, it reported great numbers, and it finds itself sitting just above the 20 week MA after it just crossed the 200 week with the 50 week MA sloping very positively in pursuit. Even more interesting is the setup of the daily MAs!!! I could argue what it looks like from either side here but I am a long so what I see is that consolidation of a big move occurred and the 50 day is just about caught up with the 20 day which might have some people running for the doors....but I think this is a head fake based on the ER and the weekly view of the stock performance. It's going to be interesting. If I'm wrong I think it'll be a slow fade to about 175/sh and it will be a very boring few months for shareholders. If I'm correct, the stock will push to it's all-time high and give it a test over the next 12 months. I don't think there will be a drastic move in either direction but coming off this flatline over the last couple months, the stock seems to be at an inflection point which will show itself in the next week or so. Should be interesting!!!"

"Record date for the upcoming dividend will be Jan-14-2021 and payable date will be Feb-05-2021. I don't care whether or not its shares might go any lower. Its dividend is so attractive and reliable. The lower it goes, the more I will buy in."
"If it goes down for no reason it will recover if it is a good company, which this is"
We need GD to combat Beijing
deal me in for more at this price.
would like to see GD buy CACI too. cheap and the right move
"The chart seems to be indicating that the stock is going to push the MAs (20 and 50 day) to want to push toward the 200 day. To get the test of the crossover I am expecting the share price to move up at least 10-15% in the near term provided the ER is anything other than negative. The only concern is that the RSI is at 72 which could prompt a period of cooling (or consolidation) around 200/sh or so. In any case, it is a strong buy and a great hold from lower levels. Enjoy the ride, B"
This is a strong Co. Highly Diversified. GD just scored another huge contract. I am buying on the dip.

RTX much to aligned with Commercial Aerospace now. GD has Gulftream division but my thought is that business jets will recover much faster than commercial. Add in the IT, ship/sub building, and land systems I believe that GD should be in same league with LMT and NOC. Not RTX, HII and TXT, where it is currently valued at. I believe the market will get it right at some point. GLTA Longs!"

Mick- I agree with you....looking at the chart and the MAs....this thing seems poised to make a move at the 200 day MA at minimum. I don't want to make predictions beyond that based off of charts but the company is so strong and perfectly diversified. I don't get why the street doesn't slap a higher market cap on them and just get it over with.......but I guess it makes the dividends more meaningful with the lower share price for now.
