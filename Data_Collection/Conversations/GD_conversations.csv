"Good morning! It’s a tremendous time to invest in many stocks, but GD has to be in top 10. Excellent management, value-friendly PE ratio and juicy consistent dividends. Don’t trust yahoo dividend N/A, here’s the facts: “The board of directors of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share on the company's common stock, payable August 7, 2020, to shareholders of record on July 3, 2020.”"
"In my opinion, this is a great buy at these prices. Hard to find a high performing company trading with its stock at a depressed level in this market. GD fits the bill."
"Very large contract win for their IT today. Had moved $ here from RTX and thought to sell some GD to back into RTX. Today's IT win and listening to RTX call stopped that. RTX much to aligned with Commercial Aerospace now. GD has Gulftream division but my thought is that business jets will recover much faster than commercial. Add in the IT, ship/sub building, and land systems I believe that GD should be in same league with LMT and NOC. Not RTX, HII and TXT, where it is currently valued at. I believe the market will get it right at some point. GLTA Longs!"
knee jerk reaction. 212 easy this week. relax- no worries
"Record date for the upcoming dividend will be Jan-14-2021 and payable date will be Feb-05-2021. I don't care whether or not its shares might go any lower. Its dividend is so attractive and reliable. The lower it goes, the more I will buy in."
GD is investing in plant. It appears orders are increasing.
Thank you to all those who are still serving in Iraq & those serving in Afghanistan.

"My sympathies go out to the US Military Men &/or Women, as well as the Afghans that all died or were in whatever degree, wounded next to the airport in Afghanistan!"
"Let me get this straight, LMT reported today and missed siting the impacts due to us pulling out of Afghanistan and as a result GD pulls back about 5%?? Sooooooo, the US pulling out of Afghanistan makes the World a safer place? Is that the take away? If anything, the stock should have ripped higher when the US pulled out b/c our 'fearless leaders' just ensured that we will have many, many more enemies and wars to fight. GD stock is a strong buy.....I am so happy I bought up what I did last year when the World was dilutional (I'll be it for good reason)."
