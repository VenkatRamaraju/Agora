"Acer, it is time for you to be awaken. Come on you can do this"
i think the 10% drop is becuase ACER the company that makes laptops got hacked and people thought it was this stock instead
5$ February
"Me too i am in.I did not want to wait ,they got good products, a strong board. I like the connection to BioMarin Pharmaceutical (i have been with them 20 years)and now the connection to RAM and Relief. Looking good. Real good."

Keep climbing!
"From Kelvin on RlftfI'm expecting takeover announcement of ACER next week. On Friday evening, ACER jumped and traded as high as $4.92 in afterhours trading. Total afterhours volume was 1,120,886 shares which is just short of 10% of ACER's outstanding shares, and 10% is what a company can buy before making an official filing. RLF is probably the one doing the buying. As ACER management owns 25% of the shares and there is a lot of institutional holdings, I think RLF has already got management to agree to the price for the coming tender offer for all the shares and will recommend to shareholders to accept the offer. The tender offer has to be at a significant premium to get all the shares. So Friday afterhours purchases would be RLF buying up as many shares as possible at a price lower than the tender offering price.The afterhours share volume is too high to be people buying on rumor or inside knowledge, so RLF is the best guess of who is buying. No one else would make a run on ACER when RLF is negotiating to buy rights to ACER's key drug. Next week should be interesting!"
This thing is rocketing.Looking good.This must be a take over. 713000 shares already $6.50.

(APLIF) MCap $51 m --Covid 19 PHASE 3 readout WITHIN days /UNKNOWN stock = Next 10++BAGGERRRhttps://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/8763/board/20210315134256-screenshot-2021-03-15-appili-therapeutics-corpora.png+++++++++
Over 21 million shares traded .Why?
Relief can easily offer 100M$ to ACER so they can uplist to Nasdaq. That would be north of 10.00$ a share. Remember that ACER has already invested upwards of 90M$ for progress on all their therapeutics of which two have a high likelihood to get FDA approved. It would make total sense for Relief and a big payoff for ACER shareholders.
Am I the only one excited about Acer?
ACER peak in Aug and Feb consistently and this time wont be different.A lot of catalyst for this stock. It should be $6 when next catalyst is announced Patient

"More info on the RLFTF/TFF agreement yesterday,,,""Specifically, today, we announced the collaboration with the United States government to formulate countermeasures to be used by our military forces. Our technology will be used to develop topical, ophthalmic, and inhaled products. As a result, and very importantly, TFF has been designated as an approved subcontractor, which will enable additional work with the government and the prime contractor. I would like to go into greater detail and will do so, once it's clear what information I can share about the specifics of the work.I can tell you that Thin Film Freezing was selected for this contract based on a very rigorous diligence. And this also bodes well for additional awards in developing products for the military. We're incredibly proud of this accomplishment. Yesterday, we announced the work we are doing in partnership with NeuroRX and GreenLight.Announcing feasibility agreement has not TFF standard corporate practice, but given the collaborative nature of our partners, the current events of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of the work, and applicability to real-time events, TFF has agreed to disclose certain aspects of these partnerships. These are very significant and important partnerships, and we look forward to working with these companies.""https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/19/tff-pharmaceuticals-inc-common-stock-tffp-q4-2020/"

"Another crossover from Relief, bought 1000 shares to avoid missing a move.If the two companies discuss a merger, what can they say at this stage?Perhaps Acer is assigned 5% of the value in a combined entity.Seems pointless to argue if it should be 4% or 6%; no one can guess the future.And both companies are all about the future- All in at the Biotech poker table; .I can tell you it matters a LOT, to Relief, to uplist to Nasdaq.We know Acer has serious $$$ and effort invested in promising drugs. But in this case, Relief may consider the listing of equal or greater value!"
"I have never owned ACER. Came up on my screen this morning and nearly bought at 4.00 today for a bounce daytrade, but held off due to the reasons for the plunge. Seems this could fall further before settling down. These type of collapses are always tempting for daytraders like myself. Sympathies to you long-time disappointed holders. After 40 years of investing/trading, I have no words of wisdom to share. However, please don't get too down and out as there is always another opportunity with other investment ideas by keeping an open mind. Best to all of you."

For the newbies who did NOT listen to Dr. Joey Johnson´s videos on YouTube:We $rlftf literally own $acer with the money they owe us.They will not be able to pay us back.So I think ACER-001 will get NDA.Relief will buy out ACER.That lifts us up to nasdaq.EUA.Robin Hooders.Redditers.Whales.2 digits.Voilá
When the Positive results for Relief come out i believe it will have a knock on effect for Acer.
"Looking over the history of this stock and it has been a nightmare for shareholders. From $30k a share, which would buy a nice luxury car to under four bucks which won't buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks. I suspect many RS over the years to keep salaries and perks up for execs at the expense of shareholders. At a market cap under $40m and European sales this could be a takeover candidate for overseas BP, if of course they saw anything of value. Acer certainly cannot afford the FDA request of further testing after the CRL. So the bottom line is this is somewhat better than a Powerball ticket but SH may be waiting for a white knight of next year's tax writeoff"

"The ACER story has parallels with the SRPT story. With not a whole lot of clinical data. SRPT got their drug approved for DMD. But the FDA said to ACER: ""no soup for you."" I guess people with exploding arteries are not as compelling as young boys who cannot walk. How is ACER going to get the $$$$ and test subjects to do another clinical study for this orphan indication? There is no doubt much equity was blown up today.

"ACER THERAPEUTICS AND RELIEF THERAPEUTICS ANNOUNCE SUBMISSION OF A NEW DRUG APPLICATION TO THE U.S. FDA FOR ACER-001 FOR TREATMENT OF UREA CYCLE DISORDERS[/b]NEWTON, Mass. and GENEVA, Aug. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acer Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ACER) (“Acer”), a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases with significant unmet medical needs, and RELIEF THERAPEUTICS Holding AG (SIX: RLF, OTCQB: RLFTF) (“Relief”), a biopharmaceutical company seeking to provide patients therapeutic relief from serious diseases with high unmet need, today announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ACER-001 (sodium phenylbutyrate) for the treatment of Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs). ACER-001 is a nitrogen-binding agent in development for use as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with UCDs involving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), or argininosuccinic acid synthetase (AS).Based on standard FDA review timelines, Acer expects to receive notification from FDA on the potential acceptance of the NDA for filing within 60 days of submission and subsequent substantive review.The 505(b)(2) NDA submission is supported by results from two previously announced bioequivalence (BE) trials in which ACER-001 showed similar relative bioavailability for both phenylbutyrate (PBA) and phenylacetate (PAA), the active metabolite of sodium phenylbutyrate, compared to BUPHENYL (sodium phenylbutyrate). Acer has also received an Agreement Letter from FDA in response to the Company’s initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) which outlines an agreed upon approach that addresses the needs of pediatric patients with UCDs.“The submission of our NDA for ACER-001 marks an important step toward bringing this potential alternative treatment option to patients with UCDs,” said Chris Schelling, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Acer. “We look forward to working with the FDA through the review process and will continue advancing our preparations for a potential launch of ACER-001, while also assisting Relief toward regulatory submissions in Europe.”Jack Weinstein, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Relief Therapeutics, added, “We are excited about the progress made to date in support of a potential regulatory approval of ACER-001 for UCDs in the U.S. With the NDA now submitted, we will continue our efforts to back ACER-001’s development in Europe by targeting submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the treatment of UCDs in Europe by the end of 2021.”ACER-001 is an investigational product candidate which has not been approved by FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). There is no guarantee that this product candidate will be accepted for substantive review, or if accepted, receive regulatory authority approval in any territory, or become commercially available for the indications under investigation.About UCDsUCDs are a group of disorders caused by genetic mutations that result in a deficiency in one of the six enzymes that catalyze the urea cycle, which can lead to an excess accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream, a condition known as hyperammonemia. Acute hyperammonemia can cause lethargy, somnolence, coma, and multi-organ failure, while chronic hyperammonemia can lead to headaches, confusion, lethargy, failure to thrive, behavioral changes, and learning and cognitive deficits. Common symptoms of both acute and chronic hyperammonemia also include seizures and psychiatric symptoms. 1,2 The current treatment of UCDs consists of dietary management to limit ammonia production in conjunction with medications that provide alternative pathways for the removal of ammonia from the bloodstream. Some patients may also require individual branched-chain amino acid supplementation.Current medical treatments for UCDs include nitrogen scavengers, RAVICTI and BUPHENYL, in which the active pharmaceutical ingredients are glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) and sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively. According to a 2016 study by Shchelochkov et al., published in Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports , while nitrogen scavenging medications have been shown to be effective in helping to manage ammonia levels in some patients with UCDs, non-compliance with treatment is common. Reasons referenced for non-compliance associated with some available medications include unpleasant taste, frequency with which medication must be taken, required number of pills, and the high cost of the medication. 3About ACER-001ACER-001 (sodium phenylbutyrate) is being developed for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including UCDs and MSUD. ACER-001 is a nitrogen-binding agent in development for use as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with UCDs involving de"

"PRESS RELEASE1Relief’s Partner Acer Therapeutics Plans NDA Submission for ACER-001 in Q3 2021 Following Pre-NDA Meeting with FDANewton, MA, USA and Geneva, Switzerland, May 25, 2021 – Acer Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ACER)(“Acer”), a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases with significant unmet medical needs, and RELIEF THERAPEUTICS Holding AG (SIX: RLF, OTCQB: RLFTF)(“Relief”), a biopharmaceutical company with its lead compound RLF100TM (aviptadil) in advanced clinical development to treat severe COVID-19 patients, today announced the outcome of Acer’s pre-New Drug Application (NDA) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ACER-001 for the treatment of Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs). ACER-001 is a proprietary immediate release multi-particulate powder formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) with a taste-masked coating. ACER001 is being developed in collaboration with Relief.The purpose of the pre-NDA meeting was to discuss the content of Acer’s planned NDA submission. Based on FDA feedback, the Companies believe the proposed data package will be sufficient to support an NDA submission under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway of ACER-001 for the treatment of patients with UCDs. Following NDA submission and FDA determination of acceptance for filing, the FDA will conduct a substantive review before deciding upon the action on the application.“We are pleased with the outcome of our recent pre-NDA meeting with FDA, supporting our belief that the studies and data we intend to include in our planned NDA for ACER-001 should be sufficient for NDA submission,” said Chris Schelling, CEO and Founder of Acer. “We remain on track to complete the NDA submission in Q3 2021, provided that we obtain agreement with the FDA on our initial pediatric study plan (iPSP).”Jack Weinstein, CFO and Treasurer of Relief Therapeutics, added: “The outcome of the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA is highly encouraging and marks an important milestone in support of the development and potential commercialization of ACER-001 worldwide. We are pleased with the progress of the ACER-001 program and look forward to working with the Acer team to potentially bring to market an alternative to existing NaPB-based treatments.”ACER-001 is an investigational product candidate which has not been approved by FDA. There can be no assurance that if submitted, an NDA will be accepted for filing and substantive review or, if filed, that an NDA would be approved."

"It was pretty simple, really. If you have gains that significant you should sell pre-market. Especially with a float this small. At least wait for it to settle before buying back in. Super easy to manipulate in pre-market and after-hours with low volume and tiny float."
Acer may merge with RELIEF THERAPEUTICS Holding SA (Pink: RLFTF).

I already have 5000 relief so adding a couple hundred of this seems to make sense. Done

SEEL (also covered by Roth Capital) is up big today on an upgrade. Our day will come (like the song says) my friends. Roth Capital has a 10.00$ target on ACER.
I have been with you ACER as a sound and promising member of RLF explosion.
"Soon after the the Relief announcement on Monday, ACER would be helping Relief for listing on Nasdaq. Hopefully, ACER will be moving like a BRPA due to small float and shorts will be crushed badly."
"This was over $7.00 Does anybody think this was people jumping on the train?I dont,somebody was buying up.It was not a short squeeze ."
4.00$ soon.
If Relief doesn’t hit it big with RLF-100 this puppy is going to drop like a stone.
"Building a position here again and accumulating.Animal C-19 data will be released any day now and that can double the share price from today. ACER-001 in full swing to being a home run. 300M$ in projected sales once approved by FDA.FDA approval of ACER-001 will easily bring us to 15.00$ a share. I have no doubt about that. The Relief connection is in and would not be surprised of they come to the Nasdaq through ACER. Company doesn't need to issue shares and is strong right now with Relief muscle.Very tight float with high insider and institutional ownership. Once the bull is released, there won't be any stopping it!"
Edsivo's marketing application was based on data from an analysis of a 2010 European study involving 53 patients.9 years later to hear there is not enough data !!!! hahahaah what a joke ..........
taking Some profit here and Buying RLFT
Guess a good entry point...
"I think this stock has a lot of upside potential, and verly little risk for a big fall. that means risk/reward is were I want it to be.new shareholder on board."
I still find it surprising that ACER is not at the level of BRPA at the meeting moment. Relief stated they wanted to get on NASDAQ. Now they have started to get to an agreement with ACER and it is obvious that this is their way to NASDAQ. Relief has the patent and the majority of the possible profit of Aviptadil which would make sense that people are better off with ACER than with BRPA...yet ACER is struggling to get 1% up and BRPA is up 30% pre market. ACER will explode! The question is when will the rest of the BRPA/RLF investors join...

They have a very unique genomics therapeutic product with no competition for an astronomical market (alcoholism) that has huge social bearings with the alternatives being non-therapee treatments which are embarrassing, don't work and have huge mental illness and imbalance repercussions. I easily see ADIL going to 10.00$ (and with the stars aligning to 20.00$) as soon as the market gets a sniff of any positive results from the current European mega trial results (5 countries) and they then go to FDA fast track approval which they have already applied for and which the FA will grant as it's an anti-addiction drug that classifies. 40M$ market cap is a gift..."
"But how can we be sure that effective concentrations are achieved by the intramuscular route? Emetine, given intramuscularly, has been established over a long period as the most specific and highly potent agent against intestinal and extra-intestinal amoebiasis [18]. The IC50 of emetine against Entamoeba histolytica is 26.8 μM [19]; this is approximately 500–1900 times higher than the EC50 for the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, implying that emetine is potentially far more potent as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. These results may cast doubt on the very low EC50 obtained with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses; however, studies by different authors have shown that emetine also has potent antiviral activity against the Zika virus (IC50 = 0.00874 μM) [13] and the human cytomegalovirus (EC50 = 0.04 μM) [20]. Interestingly, emetine also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of Ebola virus viral-like particle entry into HeLa cells (IC50 = 10.2 μM) [13]. At 0.03 µM, emetine was able to reduce HIV (wild type and multi-drug resistant M184V) infection by up to 80% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [21]. HIV reverse transcriptase was also reduced by approximately 50% at an emetine concentration of 10 μM [21]. In relation to the coronaviruses, emetine activity against four strains of coronavirus had EC50 values ranging from 0.12 to 1.43 μM, with the MERS coronavirus EC50 being 0.34 μM [22]. While this EC50 for the MERS virus is higher than in previous studies [3], it does indicate that emetine is highly active against multiple coronaviruses. It has also been demonstrated that emetine can reduce viral entry into DPP4-expressing Huh-7.5 cells by a factor of 50-fold compared with that of the control, with an EC50 value of 0.16 μM [22]."

"Hello ACER longs, I apologize if this has been asked and answered, but I came over with the RLFTF crew and I hope someone can clarify where ACER-2820 (emetine) currently stands. From what I am able to find, ACER-2820 is a broad spectrum antiviral candidate which has been through a preclinical study for the potential treatment of COVID19 patients via subcutaneous injection. Do we know the results of the preclinical trial and are there sufficient resources available to continue the study? I read about possible capital via BARDA but am unable to find additional information or current status. Thanks in advance!"

based on cash burn they will likely have to issue more stock later this year/early next year.....that ain't good ....at these prices.
what is going ? now news but stock move??? anyone can explain why ??
what if tomorrow is 15
Ongoing discussion with fda
This is one giant powerhouse!$BANB.SW $ACER $BRPA $BRPAW $BRPAU $RLFTF $RLF.SW
History shows there’s strong support in the 2 to 3 dollar range. Looks to me like Acer is just waiting to pop! Only up from here guys!!
"if FDA news comes out , ACER will pop on NDA resubmission. We have news anytime"
@wax yes something big is going on.
"Most investors bought the stock at much higher share price , ACER is definitely one of the CHEAPEST biotech in the sector with a low valuation of 30 million and a full pipeline with 2 Phase 3 Assets nearing NDA submission .STRONG BUYInsider Activity https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1069308.htmhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-penny-stocks-poised-massive-193048728.html“We highly favor ACER-001's edge over the competition, given Buphenyl's awful taste and smell and Ravicti's egregious pricing of about $900,000 per year. With ACER-001's taste masking and parity pricing to Buphenyl (about $350,000 per year), ACER-001 is a no brainer, in our view...We believe that FDA buy in on the food effect without requiring addition clinical work would be a meaningful stock catalyst,” the analyst commented.Additionally, Edsivo, ACER’s new chemical entity (NCE) designed for the treatment of vEDS, reflects a key point of strength, in Aschoff’s opinion. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue. “We essentially view Edsivo as a call option, with significant share price upside if the FDA allows ACER to amend and refile its NDA after only having to include existing natural history data... Edsivo could generate meaningful U.S. revenue for ACER, about $350 million annually, if approved for vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,” he explained.It should come as no surprise, then, that Aschoff stayed with the bulls. To this end, he left a Buy rating and $10 price target on the stock."
I wonder if there is more to come on this rlf discussion. they want uplisting and a reverse merger strategy could work well here.

Why did we spike up today? I can’t find any news?
"Acer is already up just about 10% after hours, think they got approved ?"
I think share price went up to satisfy SEC requirements of $4 SP for reverse merger. We shall see!
"Insider buying, COVID FDA approved news in few days"
Nice quintuple bottom formed with cup handle. This is the strongest technical indicator and it rarely happens with a quintuple retest (usually double or triple). VERY STRONG and BULLISH indicator.
ACER is up 11% on 1/3 of its usual daily volume. Someone connecting the dots or are we seeing the low float at play?
This non money making company appears to be manipulating the stock price. There is no fundamental reasoning to support this move today.
"I bought this morning, I'm starting to feel like I was late. much lower volume today."
12.5% of outstanding changed hands AH...
with this news we should be on the climb back to 5. MO
Looks like another jump to $5++ like in August is on the wayhttps://www.zonebourse.com/zbcache/charts/ObjectChart.aspx?Name=37866676&Type=Custom&Intraday=1&Width=336&Height=360&Cycle=DAY1&Duration=9&TopMargin=10&Render=Candle&ShowCopyright=2&ShowName=0&Company=4Traders_de
PR by NeuroRx a little while ago (NeuroRx and Relief are co-partners with RLF-100/ZyeSami). Link won't work here. Look at the RLFTF board for the link. It basically states ZyeSami inhaler has it's first patient with many more to come and more hospitals to join later.
"If it is to be that Relief will take over ACER,is there a factor , which could give an estimated of the possible Share price."
"Pivotal results expected next Q and NDA submission to follow in Q2 and this Goldmine still trading at laughable 32 million ..Oh and Covid data are next which expected during this Quarter .STRONG BUY !!!!""Topline trial results expected in Q1 2021; targeting a pre-NDA meeting with FDA in Q2 2021"""
"This is my take on the RLF lifeline to Acer... it’s insurance. If something goes wrong with NRX/BRPA deal THEN RLF will engage Acer and acquire NRX. Simple clues folks. - Bare bones executive team at RLF guaranteeing that RLF is going to join with NRX... the question is when and how.- RLF needs NRX to get through the FDA. Without Javitt the team is eviscerated.- Acer loses its IP if it doesn’t repay RLF so basically RLF has a deal they can’t refuse, loan ACER some money, lock up their IP in exclusivity, plus get IP granted to them as collateral on deal.- likely scenario is that Acer also provides some negotiation leverage so that Javitt and NRX doesn’t get greedy. If they do. RLF will do deal with Acer. - if Acer deal was the plan A, leaks would have drove this stock way up. Not happening so I don’t believe this is anything more than a good deal and backup plan.In the end, I am long RLFTF and BRPAW, but not Acer yet. Planning on picking some up this week to play the hedge in case things get messy for Javitt and team. But in the end, RLFTF shares will do well regardless and why I still keep a majority stake in RLF. OU"

try to remember this was over $15 a share and they have approval in Europe it's only because they had an issue with the FDA in the United States that this went down it doesn't mean they pulled it off the shelves over there wake up people

I miss you that is why I am backlet us go for the moonthis time
"Relief wil buy them up ,way to the Nasdaq"
dear all!! What's happening with this drug - EDSIVO (celiprolol)? any chance to get positive response from FDA any time soon?
"04:36 PM EDT, 06/23/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Acer Therapeutics (ACER) said in a regulatory filing that William Andrews has notified the company of his intention to resign from his position as the chief medical officer, effective July 8. Price: 3.5500,..."
"Good deal, let NRX/NRXP find their own way and RLF can now use ACER as a re merge to take their lead drug RLF-100 and VIP Patents to the NASDAQ separately..."
In the last few pages of RLFs presentation yesterday.RLF plans to uplist near-term to the NASDAQ in U.S.
"Well, we made the Yahoo ""Trending Ticker"" list today... Yahoo!"
"ACER has been sitting at 2.50$ for a year now with occasional spikes.. even if youre a conservative investor, this is a good bio stock to get into. They are doing clinical trials as we speak and the risk to reward ratio is way in our favour. Every 6 months this stock spikes to 5$... This happened last February and in August.. And we are about to enter February again, I except 5$ within a week or two, and couple possibly see 8$ - 9$ if we close above 6$ resistance."

ny news?
Why did the AH trading stop updating at 4:59pm? Meaning no one trading this stock after that time? Really no volume at all? So everyone who owns it is holding on the the stocks. Nice
BRPA II
This is great go RLFTF
The volatility here is off the charts. The entire available public float has been traded since Friday after close up to now and we have seen the stock price as much as double from Friday's close into pre-market this morning and then come back down 40% from that pre-market high this morning. This stock is like a roulette table at the casino. Unreal...
nice volume today... let´s go up!!!
"What is an SEC ""notice of effectiveness""? The notice of effectiveness is a public declaration by the Securities and Exchange Commission that a public company's registration statement has been accepted. For shares in a public company to trade on the open market they must be registered by the company"
Relief getting ready for the uplisting throgh ACER.Any thoughts.
"Plenty of companies like this out there, but this one is on to something. Next year will be huge so this year I am accumulating. Look at BNGO and what happened there. ACER long! GLTA"
I like the name of this company and what it's doing. Got in at $2.59This is another massively undervalued stock considering its attractive pipeline.See you all at 10+ SOON. Go ACER!
Not brain science guys. All of last year the average volume per day was 235k. In 2021 the average volume per day was 3 million. The average volume for the past 5 days is 6.5 million. All of last year 56.6 million shares traded hands. So far in 11 days of 2021 33.5 million shares traded. There are not that many shares outstanding and of that the float is even smaller. They're very few short shares. With the price action and shares traded recently you can only believe someone wants in. Don't commit the farm but you can easily drop a few thousand in here and forget about it.
"I originally was purchasing 1000 shares and decided to make it 500 shares at $4.15. With these small Pharma companies its best to invest only money you can afford to lose. With such a small position, I plan to hold. I knew that purchasing this stock was not investing but gambling."
Nice pop tomorrow like it or not....I am staying positive so there!!!!

What is going on? i can't find any news on why this sky rocketed right at the close.
"See you in 60 days, I guess?"
Acer Longs anyone thinking a Merger with Relief Therapeutics (RT) is a good thing? There were rumors of that happening a few months back any truth to that rumor? Financially how is Acer going to pay RT back? How about a poll? Thumbs Up Merger Thumbs Down Never going to happen!

Interesting gateway between Relief and AcerHello everyone from France
"New news on relief website! Relief is responsible for the development and commercialization of ACER-001 in Europe and expects to discuss its plans with the European Medicines Agency this summer. Pending the outcome of these discussions and provided that Acer submits an NDA in the U.S. mid this year as planned, Relief then anticipates submitting a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for approval of ACER-001 for the treatment of UCDs in the European Union before the end of 2021.Based on the timelines outlined above and pending a positive decision by regulators, ACER-001 could be launched in both the U.S. and Europe during 2022.ACER-001 is also being developed for the treatment of Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD).https://relieftherapeutics.com/newsblog/relief-provides-update-on-progress-and-plans-with-acer-001-for-the-treatment-of-urea-cycle-disorders"

Dangerous game being played here with float less than 7M. If you've got 90% gains take them.
Lets go baby 
Gator looking at Acer and before my eyes it is transforming into a SPAC that just got a lifeline from RLF. Hmmm....?
Well that fizzled fast....Pre-market high was 7.38$. We're almost 3.00$ lower now.
$acer up big. No news I can see.
funny how few people are on this chat... I bought some 2 weeks ago and it's up 31%. who else is loving this stock ?
So what do you guys recommend should I sell my stocks or not?
ACER is similar to GALT. Both are biotechs that have struggled for decades to come up with something to sell. GALT had a similar drop about three years ago down to $3.50. Look at where they are now. I think the investment community have given up on ACER and the only way they will get $$$$ is via an Oaktree type deal. This is why the stock is being dumped. How can you be working for decades and your leading candidate is still not in P2?
"I know they mentioned Q3, but when do you believe ACER-001 will get NDA Submission? That should really spike the price again."
ACER is expected to enter in double digit soon.
noice
https://investorplace.com/2021/03/acer-stock-the-merger-rumor-that-has-acer-therapeutics-racing-higher/
"2-3 quarters worth of cash maybe, depending on how much they will need to commit to the ACER-001 bridging study due to begin Q4. no real near term catalysts. small float though can be some fireworks when the institutional holders finish dumping"
"No news, looks like just anothet PnD to trap traders"
More than 7.5M shares trades at pre-market and more than 1.0M shares traded after close Friday. That's almost two times the float. There is something definitely brewing.
Does anyone have an idea what this will be worth upon merger with Rlftf?
same pattern as amtx tomorrow hit acer at $10 PLUS .... Hurry up
Taking off after hours. $4.85 up 42%.
Got in right before close. Let’s see where this will go!
Sorry all Longs I feel your pain happened to me years ago.
"In the next few months, it will reach $ 30And remember this conversation"
"Sent them an email last week and they responded 'Thank you for your inquiry. In the coming weeks, we expect emetine animal data results and also expect to submit a meeting request with the FDA to discuss our proposed plan to provide sufficient confirmatory evidence in support of the EDSIVO NDA.'"
Nice pre-market does anyone have an idea as to to SP value at buyout?
here she come. don't be late with this spkie i am seeing 15
Something in connection with the announcement of relief today?
Added some shares here ahead of the covid data which could hit the wire anyday now (expected during this Quarter according to management)
thank you yahoo chat for the mute button..bye bye Jerry..
Our Maple Syrup buddies at $Acer also up. Probably want to be paid in Relief shares aswell.
