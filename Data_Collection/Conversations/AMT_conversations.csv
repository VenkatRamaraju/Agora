It seems AMT is a bit late on declaring the next dividend. Any ideas why?
suddenly 5 G is not good for AMT? AMT will be busy with 5 G
"Over the last 4 quarters, AMT has beat its consensus earnings estimates 2 times and missed them 2 times. Their next earnings announcement is approximately 5 weeks away."
Jefferies just cut the price target from $356 to $336. That is still a nice appreciation percentage from here.
Another new high pre-market above 301!! Yow!
"Guys - The reason for the weakness is that AMT is a top holding in REIT ETFs. Investors are cutting back holdings there as rates increase, so the managers of those funds have to sell some of all of their holdings to stay true to the index that they are linked to. I have not posted here for a while, but have been here for years. My cost is very low. As long as AMT keeps taking share around the world, and most importantly, keeps increasing the dividend EVERY QUARTER, I won't be going anywhere,"

261 to 284 in 11 calendar days. That's more like it.
This stock makes no sense. It's dropped about 14 percent since the high and the bottom does not seem to be in. Very frustrating to be honest. The only catalyst i can see happening is the upcoming infrastructure bill.
Good price to buy?
I have followed both Crown Castle and AMT. Both have been falling and a few Funds have bailed. Am wondering if it is because cheap money is coming to an end and rates are climbing. Both have a LOT of debt. Could this be why?
"AMT, owner of tens of thousands of cell towers. but 5G is still a long way from being profitable. still in very early build out stage, very little 5 G content."

I love the stock but I hate when it drops without any logical reason.
I started a small position today 10;shares at $289.It will probably tank now and if it does I will buy more

Whatever happened to Tillman Infrastructure? I thought they were supposed to disrupt AMT and CCI business. Can anyone shed some light on this situation? Thank you.
"AMT generated much more in revenues than it spent during the most recently completed quarter.The company's continuing operations are more profitable than those of many other companies in its industry, resulting in an operating margin that is above its industry average."
