"Another new high above 298. Toot, toot!"
"I was recently reading some articles on 5g and ""health concerns"". Was a little surprised on why it would be any different than say 3g or 4g. Turns out that 5g requires several transmitters to be chained in close proximity to the user The most common example was mounting them in street light posts. To be honest, I had assumed all along that 5g would just be using the same towers as prior generations. Does this change the game for AMT? It's been one of my set it and forget it stocks for the past several years. This may be the very first time I've had just a bit of concern."
Today J.P.Morgan increased their AMT target from 163 to 173. Another new all-time today at 163.68.
I have followed both Crown Castle and AMT. Both have been falling and a few Funds have bailed. Am wondering if it is because cheap money is coming to an end and rates are climbing. Both have a LOT of debt. Could this be why?
"I've been watching this stock for about 6 months. Just never pulled the trigger yet.i researched the threat of 5g satellites and NASA says the thousands of collisions every year would be catastrophic.So if people are selling for this reason, they're misinformed. So I'll just sit on my hands and wait to see where the bottom ends up being."
"I think I found what is bothering the tower stocks (AMT, CCI, SBAC). Elon Musk has a project to provide satellite internet which is backed by his SpaceX technology. If this will work, which I am assuming it will, it's a game changer."
"ALL cell tower stocks at 6 month lows while the Dow, S&P, Nasdaq are at new record highs. WHY?"
Decent Bloomberg article located below quote.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-firms-steer-clear-europes-060000509.html
"Every day (or at least every week) AMT hits a new all time high, no matter how bad the actual market is"
"Been here as a holder since AMT was 13. Have not posted in a while as the stock has been quiet. This is typical over all that time - periods of dormancy then a strong upward move. As long as the dividend is increased every QUARTER, sell at your own risk. I can't see any trigger today other than some technical nonsense, but I'll take it."
all time high today!
"going to have a double bottom ,should bounce back up, but nothing g is a for sure. Bullish sign of it does"

Under the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement, provided that American Tower and its affiliates continue to own all the AST Series B Preferred Units purchased by it pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, AST agrees to not issue or sell any equity securities in the PIPE offering contemplated under the Equity Purchase Agreement to a cellular tower company, which is defined as an entity primarily engaged in the neutral host business but excludes wireless mobile network operators or financial sponsors.The Amended and Restated Letter Agreement also contemplates that AST and American Tower will enter into commercial agreements to use American Tower facilities for AST’s terrestrial gateway facilities in certain markets. AST’s space platform and gateway facilities will provide MNOs with mobile service infrastructure in areas not well served by terrestrial networks. The term of the operational agreement between AST and American Tower is five years after the initial launch of commercial mobile services by AST.In markets in which Vodafone operates, AST will work with Vodafone and American Tower to evaluate and plan deployments with preferred vendor status. The usage of any American Tower services in a Vodafone market will be memorialized in a commercial agreement among all three parties. In markets where Vodafone does not operate (“Carrier Neutral Markets”), AST and American Tower may enter into an agreement for American Tower to manage the operation of the AST-deployed gateway facility in such market. In Carrier Neutral Markets where AST requires a third party to provide a gateway facility or services, AST agrees to not accept any bid that is inferior to American Tower’s best and final proposal for such gateway facility or services. AST also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to utilize American Tower facilities in (i) Vodafone markets where Vodafone decides to not use its facilities, (ii) in Carrier Neutral Markets, and (iii) instances where AST requires a third party vendor.Additionally, AST will work with American Tower to evaluate and plan gateway facility and radio access network data center deployments with preferred vendor status to offer carrier-neutral hosting facilities in certain equatorial markets. American Tower will serve as the preferred vendor for carrier neutral hosting facilities. AST will pay American Tower a monthly connection fee for use of a carrier neutral hosting facility, which will be charged back to each applicable MNO. If AST and American Tower agree to construct a new carrier neutral hosting facility or improve an existing one and American Tower elects to fund all such capital expenditures, American Tower will provide ATS with a fair-market, long-term lease to such facility."
Answer for MG: Over the past five years AMT is up 153% while CCI is up 87%. Sell the highest quality company with serious world-wide growth ahead and buy the second company for a little more yield?? No thank you!
All-time high as the market crashes and burns. I said here recently that AMT is the very best stock. No change in that thinking. Wonderful dividend bump as frosting.
The next dividend payment should be announced this week (3/5?).Estimate: 1.08 from 1.01.
"I'm trying to understand what people actually hate about this stock. 5G coming, companies financials are solid, pays over a 2% dividend yield. Huge growth potential. What is so miserable about owning this company?"
Nearly double daily average volume today with the price flattening out last couple hours. That's usually a sign of a bottom but the market has been kind of weird the past year so who knows.
"Another quarterly div increase; this time 5 cents, from .70 to .75.Won't take much more before AMT's current dividend will be three times the amount of it's initial .27 dividend, announced 6/13/13"

one of the most solid stock I have in my accounts. It does not really react to markets and rarely is down for long.
"Amt, strong start in a bloodbath this morning. Pondering buying more prior to quarterly reoprt"
"strange fluctuations in share price, volitility is a day traders playground"
"Have been holding AMT since $66/share. Curious how this stock frequently drops when the market advances and vice versa. It's almost a contrarian play on the market, but I certainly can't complain about the long term trend."
"Over the last 4 quarters, AMT has beat its consensus earnings estimates 2 times and missed them 2 times. Their next earnings announcement is approximately 5 weeks away."
"AMT filed a prospectus today, but not to worry. No dilution. It is for Senior Notes maturing in 2025 and 2029."
"Perhaps what I wrote three months ago, ""Three cent bump for next div payment; maybe next one will be a buck!"" will become a reality.Last div: 0.95Next div, to be announced 12/12 or thereabouts, is forecast to be increased to 1.01 (Bloomberg terminal).See what happens."
Did you see that AMT was a co-investor in the SPAC NPA that's bringing AST and Science public? Rather I intriguing considering what AST has in the works.
AMT best tweet of the day:Jonathan Litt - L&B @JonLitt ·2hCell tower REIT $AMT signed an MLA (Master Lease Agreement) with T-Mobile signaling the real kick-off to the 5G wars and what we believe should be another decades-long period of strong growth for cellular towers.
5G still long way from daily use in USA. AMT will benefit from 5G years from now
"Answer for John: John: There are a LOT of traders that use AMT as defensive vehicle. They don't know if it is a cell tower company or a maker of hockey pucks. When they get a ""risk on"" signal, AMT is sold, and they buy the hot stock du jour. When that reverses, back they come. I have been a holder, and posting about AMT, since the price was 13. This happens over and over, but we keep on truckin' and make new all-times on a regular basis. As long as the dividend is increased every QUARTER, stay the course!"
Really thorough piece on Barron’s giving the case AMT can go up 90% in the next 5 years
Deutsche Bank downgrade to Hold not helping things this morning.
"Very frustrating. This stock has been essentially range bound in the mid to high 130s since August of 2017, while the market has climbed 14% in the same time period. I’ve been holding for about 5 years now, but I really have to wonder whether or not it still makes sense to hold it."

It seems AMT is a bit late on declaring the next dividend. Any ideas why?
"AMT , owned it for years, but it is almost immune to the rest of the market news. it makes money and has a lot of towers in valuable places"
$AMT Downgrades Oppenheimer Holdings Perform Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 270 » USD 316
Why this always doing since summer?
261 to 284 in 11 calendar days. That's more like it.
I told you. The entry point is too high. Sell!
I think AMT is still expanding and is in debt for the right reasons. who can compete with them?
"Long AMT, this appears to be a very long term stock and will only get better , was hoping for a faster growth projection but feel very confident in this sector."
"As forecast, the Q div was bumped up by two cents, from 1.08 to 1.10.And the beat goes on."
"this is definitely a long term investment, so pity that I did not know this company earlier"
"interest rates up, AMT shares down. lock step decline in low dividend payer reit"
Three cent bump for next div payment; maybe next one will be a buck!
Congratulations to all you believers that bought more while on the little slump and ignored the Muskies that sold in their little panic. AMT rocks and has all but paid off my mortgage just in dividends over the last 10 years. If you look at the past history of ups and downs they always come back strong.
"An excellent read on towers and data centers. My picks are AMT and CONE,https://www.reit.com/news/reit-magazine/november-december-2018/reits-ready-5g"
The whole sector is trading in the exact same pattern. The 5 day charts of CCI and AMT look literally the same. My guess would be that someone is dumping the safer investments as signs of market stabilization for the broader market have come out these past days.Sector needs to find a bottom on lower movements in the overall market to climb again. My guess is for that to happen in the next two days.
"A newly trading ETF - MVPS - chose the 100 ""Thematic All-Stars"" as their initial holdings, and have included AMT. The size of the holdings is very small as the ETF just started, but the point is that we were chosen. Excellent!"
Amt and all cell tower stocks will fly once hedge funds rotate back to this beaten down sector just a matter of time so we sit collect div and accumulate more shares
"Does anybody else think that AMT will bid on the about-to-merge Indus Towers?The market price has gotten cheaper and the urgency for CASH has become greater for the cell phone operators.Indus has 163,000 towers. With AMT's 70,000, they will own less than 50% of the total towers, but maybe more than 50% of India's tower revenue.The gov't is pushing ""Digital India"" and wants to reach all corners of the country with cell service and wi-fi internet.AMT is positioned to be the best owner/operator of these towers.AMT has been paying down expensive debt and extending due dates for other debt.They seem to be getting ready for something BIG.ARPU (Average Revenue Per Unit) needs to rise quickly in order to have a healthy cellphone industry in India.This has started.The deadline for the big merger is December 24, so we should get a clue real soon.Only the Dept. of Telecom needs to approve this.Does anybody agree, or think that this is crazy?"
Does anyone now if AMT will significantly benefit from GOP Corp tax reduction? I found a site that listed their effective tax rate of 9%.

"Hey, wooglin - Our stock has been hijacked. Overlay our three month chart with IYR, the real estate ETF. It didn't use to be that way, as we tripled and quadrupled our money in AMT, but now we are at the mercy of the mindless algos and amateur traders who buy and sell IYR with every miniscule move in interest rates. Sad."
Reason for today's action?https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=15875591&gfv=1
AMT stock price has gone no where for the past year. I own the stock and like the company. I think the best thing might be to slow down dividend growth and start reducing debt. Reducing debt will reduce risk and I believe the stock price will respond.

I cannot understand why there are so many bearish analysts on AMT.
10 year treasury up again today. REITS need to raise payouts to compete
"Another dividend boost, up to $1.21/share. The divvy boosts will keep coming, sooner or later the price will move up with it!"
Jefferies just cut the price target from $356 to $336. That is still a nice appreciation percentage from here.
"No one here seems to know the reason for the price drop from record highs. It is simple. AMT is the largest REIT and is held in every real estate ETF and fund. With Covid, other holdings in those portfolios were getting slammed (think shopping malls and office buildings and more). Investors wanted out, so the portfolio managers had to sell some of everything to meet redemptions. The selloff was NOT related to AMT's business. I have owned AMT since the teens (Wooglin knows that). I added to my position at 223. Hopefully the worst is over and we are on our way to recovery."
The pendulum has swung too far. The Covid/Reopening plays are attracting all the money. The steady long term growers with a clear stable growth path are being sold since they held up during the shut down. So the less quality stocks with more unpredictable cash flow and growth are being chased while the steady growth and cash flow producers are being sold. Opportunity is at hand. Don't miss it by second guessing yourself. The chasers will end up being wrong.
"Is AMT division in Woburn, Massachusetts a good place to work for supply chain/ planning positions? How is the work culture?"
"5G is just starting to be rolled out. AMT is in good status to grow with 5G. keep those dividends stair stepping up, thanks"
How durable is this business? Really? Will it still be going strong in 20 years? And is the debt load a concern?
Buying
"When REITS decline in value, some sell their REIT ETF or Fund. This results with additional selling pressure to the REIT ETF or Fund's individual holdings.AMT is well represented in some REIT ETFs/Funds.(works both ways)"
"AMT, owner of tens of thousands of cell towers. but 5G is still a long way from being profitable. still in very early build out stage, very little 5 G content."
"Guys - Our problem is that AMT is held in REIT ETFs, which traders are dumping because of all the talk about real estate rental and leasing prices tumbling because of the virus. When each ETF gets redemptions, they have to sell from all holdings, including AMT, which they don't want to sell. We own one of the strongest of all REITs. This too shall pass and we will continue to make new highs."
...at this point I'm in $AMT & $CCI to cover my 5G investments. anyone know the company that makes the component that makes the new 5G chips work?
"I have owned AMT for 6 years. it has been a quiet, hidden gem. the reit status is good"
"Guys - The reason for the weakness is that AMT is a top holding in REIT ETFs. Investors are cutting back holdings there as rates increase, so the managers of those funds have to sell some of all of their holdings to stay true to the index that they are linked to. I have not posted here for a while, but have been here for years. My cost is very low. As long as AMT keeps taking share around the world, and most importantly, keeps increasing the dividend EVERY QUARTER, I won't be going anywhere,"
Buying Hand over Fist!
Better get in while you can before takeoff after earnings. This thing is primed to explode after trading sideways for 2 months
Whatever happened to Tillman Infrastructure? I thought they were supposed to disrupt AMT and CCI business. Can anyone shed some light on this situation? Thank you.
"To buy into weakness is to say I have no choice but to be long on this company. I can't explain how this company is more than 20% off its 52 week highs and approaching levels below pre-COVID, when all it's doing is positioning itself for the explosive 5G market."
"Hey, Yahoo - Folks have been making educated posts about AMT and 5G in recent days, including me. They have disappeared. What is going on? Is some computer program making the boards worthless?"
"And now we have 213+. I did see this:Date: Thursday, June 6th, 2019Stock(s) mentioned: AMT, AWK, CNS, NSC, SPXSource: Barron’s (https://www.barrons.com)Summary: Dividend growth for many infrastructure companies is “supported by businesses that have very predictable cash flows,” Ben Morton of Cohen & Steers says. He expects them to increase their dividends by about 5% to 7% a year."
Double digit average growth of AFFO through 2027 equates to AFFO of around $16.50 per share or more. Dividend is likely to be over $10 per share which implies it is still only paying out 60% of AFFO. Which means there is room for the dividend to be as high as $12 or $13 and still be safe. Based on today’s price it will be yielding as much as 6%. That is based on visible growth in the bag already. It does not include additional accretive M&A or new service revenue which they are working on. AMT is solid asset to hold the next 5 to 7 years IMO.
Please check this out........comments please?? This is the article I was referring to earlier........https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-verizon-strike-tower-agreement-195401995.html
"A bit of news that I missed on Friday: ""Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew Niknam resumed coverage of American Tower with a Buy rating and $287 price target."" Nice!Also, some sites are showing the after-market closing price of AMT at 267. It was a huge trade of 1 share. :)"
"AMT perfectly positioned to take advantage of 5G, then 6G, then 7G. Can't believe people don't get the math."
About all you need to know:AMT - annual dividend 2012- $0.902013- $1.102014- $1.402015- $1.812016- $2.172017- $2.622018- $3.152019- $3.78 Annual dividend has more than quadrupled since 2012 (CAGR 22.8%!!!) and is increased every QUARTER!!
"Earnings will be announced tomorrow at 7:00 AM, with CC at 8:30 AM EST.They may have some news."
"New coverage from Credit Suisse puts the target price at $308!!! ""Early innings"" of the 5G cycle. Nice."
"What nonsense to use a specific number like ""54.67"". If you are that dedicated to technicals, you will never get to move out of Mom's basement. Also, at that price, assuming the next two quarters of dividend increases will be as expected, AMT would yield about 7.00%. Don't think so. As I have posted several times, managers that need to be a specific % or more invested at all times buy AMT in down markets for protection, and then sell when a rally starts. I have no doubt that we will make new highs."
204.50 pre-market! Another new high. AMT continues to be an outstanding stock.
"Here's an interesting take. I'm not sure it will do much for the stock price, but we'll take it: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4358784-american-tower-corp-top-pick-in-esg-infrastructure-investing"
Anyone has any idea why this is going south?
Long term you can’t go wrong. This CCI and Cellnex. Recession or no recession 5G continues because it HAS TO.
How many longs here are diversified with CCI as well? I primarily went with AMT years back due to international footprint. In hindsight I should have picked up some CCI as well. Dividend growth/yield looks attractive there.

Good price to buy?
AMT and T-Mobile signed a new 15-year deal for 5G rollout
It seems like these REIT's go down when the broader market goes up. I did read that these were considered defensive stocks so maybe there's some truth in that. I saw on CNBC that China was rolling out their 5G much sooner than expected and that they were investing a crazy amount of money in their infrastructure so maybe we'll follow suit. Who really knows.
Doubled my investment from 2014. Let er ride! one of my best picks.
"Without fanfare AMT just raised the dividend to $1.24. Annualized this is $4.96 compared to the $4.53 last year or 9.5% higher. But, most likely $4.96 will increase as each subsequent quarter dividend is raised as is historically the case. The $1.24 dividend paid in April 2021 compares to a $1.08 dividend paid in April 2020 which is actually a 15% increase year over year. If they raise each quarter by 15% then this years dividend would actually be $5.20. Which would only be about 55% of 2021 AFFO. So, $5.20 is reasonable to expect and that would equate to a 2.6% yield. Not many REITs growing dividends at 15% and still only paying out 55% of AFFO."
what effect will 5G have on AMT and what is timetable? will the Sprint/T mobile merger be a negative?
"I find it strange that AMT sold off on this quarterly report. The Wells Fargo analyst increased their target price from 176 to 190 and said that the quarter was ""solid."" Also, an analyst at KeyBanc moved their target to 185. This little slide is nothing to worry about. Onwards."
do they build more towers for 5g or just change the system on the existing agreement....not sure how this makes the stock worth more
This downtrend has to stop at some point. The underlying business is getting more and more valuable each day and the stock is essentially flat over the last year
"New all-time high today for AMT. I know that I keep posting when it happens, but I want you to take a look. How many stocks do you have that keep doing this?"
suddenly 5 G is not good for AMT? AMT will be busy with 5 G
yeah right! like cell phones are going away. total market manipulation by day traders selling short. total BS.
New all-time over 286 pre-market!
"news about phone towers potential to be fixed to electric power poles and other structures. but signals cannot be good with other electronics blocking use of small towers in urban areas. AMT has good properties, strategic locations, growth continues. but dividend is losing to 10 year treasury rates."
"FWIW, there's a S.A. post ""American Tower: Rising Rates Selloff Creates Opportunity"" that was posted this AM Jan 16."
10 points up today. That's a good day's work. No doubt in my mind that we will make new highs.
Be patient and buy more at these levels. All we need is a catalyst and it will explode higher. Remember back at the end of May we shot from $228 to $265 in 1 week off of a single upgrade from Oppenheimer. It can happen again.
"Owned AMT for 15 years. The growth investors have fled to quick money trades. New CEO, new acquisitions, unfounded fears of interest rates rising and fear of satellites taking over airwaves have institutions weary. Think we have more pain until safe haven mentality comes back to market. Stock is way oversold and probably will stay that way until Market seeks safety and new CEO proves he can provide growth. Until then reinvest dividends and stay long. Will be back over 240 after new acquisitions starting ringing the register and Dish starts leasing."
"Read this on Reddit. I'm long on this stock. Just trying to figure what the future holds.From Reddit:Imo what StarLink is going to do in the long term, is put up their own ground based Towers. And because these towers don't need access to ISP backbones on the ground, they can go anywhere, places where towers can't currently go. So they're going to acquire those rights for cheap and out pace the competition.StarLink will design ground towers to connect to star link in space and then beam off each other via LOS, radio, etc.So imagine you have 20,000 ground towers talking to star link, All they need is power, nothing else, which could be primarily solar and battery backed up (and they have Tesla Batteries to tap into there).These towers will be designed to relay off each other, so if one tower can't get to the Sky (clouds weather etc, it'll patch in from the nearest other tower it can talk to) so every tower is always online regardless of which towers have access to the Sky.Star Link will eventually obsolete ground based ISP's and back bones and eventually Oceanic Fiber too, upsetting a billion dollar industry.In some cases, routes to StarLink and back to earth are Shorter than current routes over the ground. And routes through space will have less hops than routes on the ground. So what is currently a 250 MS latency from say Australia to Idaho might be 100 ms over StarLink."

"Question to the board??? How come AMT's earnings show big miss after big miss yet the stock is basically pretty flat for the past year?? What I'm I missing?? Also, with all their long term contracts you would think that they would never miss on earnings??? Puzzled. Most stocks would be in near 52 week lows with earnings that look this bad.I do think 5-G will be a growth driver sometime in the near future."

Why AMT in red today when market is up? It is weird based on recent trend.
"Nice 7.14% bump in the div, from 0.84 to 0.90...this never gets old, but will AMT ever have the same div for four Qs and then presumably an increase? That is the tact CCI (and most companies) took."
"I just read, IMO, a decent overview on AMT via Seeking Alpha.Not necessarily what you might want to read, as the author makes some compelling comments about AMT being overvalued--it's a pretty thorough analysis.Reinvesting distributions slightly placates having a lower share price...If curious, search ""AMT: American Tower: A Moat-Worthy REIT To Own When The Price Is Right """
Nice five cent bump in the quarterly dividend; 0.79 to 0.84.Never gets old.
Another new high pre-market above 301!! Yow!
bigger dividends will help AMT compete with 10 yr. treasury
American Tower stock upgraded from Neutral to Buy by Goldman Sachs.
Who else is excited for the coming earnings report? Time for AMT to disclose great outputs of all the new contracts they made
This stock makes no sense. It's dropped about 14 percent since the high and the bottom does not seem to be in. Very frustrating to be honest. The only catalyst i can see happening is the upcoming infrastructure bill.
Another dividend increase announced yesterday. Growth and return continue. An increase despite the Covid crisis hitting many companies.
Buying back up the Truck 
"From a Bloomberg:New Street (ever hear of this firm?) upgraded AMT, SBAC & CCI yesterday.""Sprint.T-Mobile combination and Dish's entry into the market should ""materially"" boost growth.""""We see the next five years as ones with unprecedented growth and visibility."" (analyst Spencer Kurn).Note was titled ""Entering the Golden Age"".Kurn raised both AMT & SBAC to buy; CCI to neutral.Price targets (FWIW):AMT: $315SBAC: $355CCI: $160Kurn sees next catalyst being the signing of Master Leasing Agreements with the new T-Mobile--may occur 2H20."
"For those questioning LT growth prospects as reason for sell off,pls consider the possibility that this is simply a normal technical retrace. On a closing basis the stock moved up from $179 March closing low to a $271 closing high. It is very normal & healthy for the stock to retrace such a big move. 50% fib of the move is @ $225 closing level, while 61.8% fib is $214 . We've found support in that area presently. No idea if that's it or if the Boyz want to correct stock further to 78% which would be @ the 'rumored' $200 level suggested here previously. I slowly scale in @ these fibs levels because I have no idea where price goes ST , but am confident longer term. IMO a good sign that the retrace could be over would be if/when price moves above the $230 closing level & definitively $243 . We've been below that area for past few months. GLTA"
"Yes, I am splitting hairs:I wonder why AMT adjusted its dividend payment schedule.Today's payment, 2/2, was declared 9 days earlier and was ex div 2 days earlier than last years div, BUT it was paid 19 days later. The difference between my div being reinvested 1/12 for 1/14 payment v actually being reinvested 1/29 for 2/2 payment? I received a bit more than 6% less shares. Actual reinvestment was done @227.03 v 213.22 (av of high and low that day). Yup, shares were at their recent LOWS on the day my div ""should"" have been reinvested had AMT kept to its plan. Reinvesting last Friday was better than reinvesting on payment date!"
"Do any readers have an opinion about AMT buying a controlling interest in Indus Towers and its 172,094 towers and sites?The Indian digital service companies will grow rapidly, creating huge demand for towers."
"American Tower Completed Redemption of All Outstanding 2.800% Senior Noteshttps://www.sectorreports.com.au/landing-page/?symbol=AMTAmerican Tower Corp (NYSE: AMT) closed at $230.14 yesterday with the one of the highest market cap of $102.02 billion. Among the largest global REIT companies, American Tower had earlier announced that it redeemed all of the outstanding 2.800% senior unsecured notes due 2020.All these notes are redeemed according to the terms of their principal amount, along with the accrued interest up to (or beyond) May 11.the redemption price in totality for the transaction was $759.3 million approximately and this includes accrued interest of $9.3 million.With the completion of this transaction of redemption, the company has no 2.800% notes outstanding."
$282 almost time to add some!
Some helpful person just bought some shares at 180 in the pre-market!
"Will AMT have a financial problem IF Star Link is successful. See below. What do you think?SpaceX said its nascent satellite internet service called Starlink has already seen “extraordinary demand” from potential customers. • Elon Musk’s space company said in a filing Friday that “nearly 700,000 individuals” across the U.S. indicated interest in the company’s coming service"
I love the stock but I hate when it drops without any logical reason.
We have a beat on earnings and a 20% dividend increase!! Yow!!
What I thought this was a boring stock it is now my 4th biggest in % gainer
I started a small position today 10;shares at $289.It will probably tank now and if it does I will buy more
Why would AMT invest in SpaceMobile if satellites are a threat to tower companies?
Doesn't matter what the market is doing - AMT keeps climbing the ladder. Another new all-time @ 284+!
Does anybody think that the approval by a federal judge of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger will negatively impact AMT shares? Could the consolidation from 4 carriers to 3 mean that less parties will be bidding for space on AMTs towers or that T-Mobile will have more clout in negotiations now that they will be bigger?
"cell phone use up all over the world. 5G will expand , towers will be needed for next generation of phones.AMT in good position for business."
just loaded boat you should too
"Wow! Goldman Sachs says that the tower operators are the best way to play 5G!https://blog.tipranks.com/goldman-sachs-3-5g-stocks-to-snap-up-now/""Feldman’s final two points touch on what he sees as the bottom line for investors interested in 5G stocks: that cell tower owners and operators are the best stock position to take as the switch begins and expands."""
Another new all-time high above 295. Obviously the institutions that are buying with both hands are not at all worried about this new satellite announcement.
I have done a large amount of research on this stock and have come to a realization that they own at least 50% of this market.
Double whammy. 1) Rotation out of REITs in general. 2) AMT short term is being hurt by loss of Sprint leases. Longer term growth is intact with 5G and the loss of Sprint will be offset by growth provided by acquisition of Telxius Towers. Everyone has known of the Sprint churn since the merger so why it is now an issue makes no sense. I am buying a little more every new leg down.
Are satellites a threat to AMT and CCI. Is the technology viable yet????
I tried to post a link to this last night.Interesting read over at Seeking Alpha titled - SpaceMobile: The Future Of Wifi Could Be HereLook in the comment section. Very interesting the info there
IM AN AMT SHARE HOLDER AND VERY GLAD!!!!! THIS STOCK IS GOING TO BE THE STOCK TO OWN AND YOU WILL SEE MANY MILLIONARES TO SOME ADVICE CCI IS ALSO ANOTHER TOWER STOCK TO HOLD BUT THE COMPANY IS ONLY IN AMERICA WHERE AS AMT HAS GONE GLOBAL AND SO WILL ITS SHARE PRICE VERY VERY SOON!!! ONCE 5G IS KICKED INTO GEAR IT WILL BE TOO LATE!!!!! THIS WILL BE THE STOCK OF ALL STOCKS TO OWN!!!!!!
"Wash, rinse. repeat! Another new high (above 303) on a down day. Toot, toot,"
"When the 5G satellites are put into play, the cell towers will be obsolete."
"197 to 268 in a matter of weeks. Right back near the old all-time high. Extremely strange how far it went down. The expected dividend increase was announced, and there were no company negatives that I have found. It seems that folks that thought rates were going up sharply redeemed REITS that included AMT, so the managers of the REITS had to trim every stock owned. We have to pay attention to this if/when rates really do start to head up."
"Well, we did get a downgrade to neutral Friday early from UBS, but AMT went on to make another all-time high at 214+. The analyst's target is 222 and says that AMT is ""well positioned."""
"AMT declared its next div payment: 0.92, up two pennies from the 4/26 payment."
"I just glanced at the Gurufocus piece...Akre Capital Management sold 3690 AMT shares during Q2, or 0.05% of its position leaving it with 7,037,939 shares. File under micro managing?"
"Anybody home?? Cramer mentioned AMT last night, wondering about the CEO change, saying that he liked Jim Taiclet, who has gone off to Lockheed Martin. I believe that we have crossed that bridge, and that Tom Bartlett is doing just fine."
"Closed at ATH. Have held this stock since 2003, and believed in it the entire time."
"10 year bond going higher, competing with AMT small dividend"
"Hey - wooglin - Ready for some big new all-time highs for AMT? Coming to a portfolio near you soon. :)PS to All: I have not posted here for a while, but I own AMT since $13, and I'll still be here when we go a lot higher."
AMT BUYING HAND OVER FIST! BACK UP THE MONEY  
Huge new high today at 160! I've been posting here on AMT since it was in the 30's. Hold tight! 5G and worldwide growth and the dividend increasing every QUARTER. There is no better stock.
"I missed this. Not a huge deal, but every litle bit helps: ""American Tower (NYSE:AMT) was upgraded by research analysts at Wells Fargo & Co from an “equal weight” rating to an “overweight” rating in a research report issued on Sunday"""
You sell I buy thank you
