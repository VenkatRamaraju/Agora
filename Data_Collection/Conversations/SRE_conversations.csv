How do we feel about doing a $140 call July 19th exp?
"#SRE in play. Indicators are looking bullish, according to stoxline. .Looking for breakout at 119.78 for a run up to 139.90."
my kids inherited roughly 700 shares of SRE. Would you keep the stock?
"The CEO, Mr. Martin, makes 5.35 million dollars a year. Isn't a little excessive?"
"Well, well, well. Finally a business with a spine. Sempra allowing/telling Southern California Gas to sue the state.The state has foolishly banned the use of natural gas in any new building. California, a so-called environmental state, has no problem killing untold numbers of Bald and Golden Eagles and other birds, and recently allowed more to die by wind turbines. Turbines need regular cleaning with dangerous cleansers, require lots of grease, and the areas they are in are cleared of trees. California infected all of us when they first required anti flammable material to be used in clothing. Now they are targeting wildlife. How can anyone who loves the environment respect california. https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Largest-US-Gas-Utility-Sues-California-Over-Climate-Policy.html"
"Another pcg company, sell, just like pcg, they dont trim hazard trees!"
#JE is being compared with #ATO #SRE #OKE Do you DDdon’t buy or sell based on other assumptions
Still zero word about the Cameron LNG plant in LA. That can’t be good.
"Take a look EIX, great entry point today for an investor owned utility. Divy is pushing 5% here. Buy on a down day!"
SRE pretty much flat past 5 years. Coiled spring IMHOGLTA
"SDGE monopolies the entire Most southern part and east of California both gas and electric and EV is on the move. Long term with dividends, can’t go wrong with this company."
Why is this stock going down? Because of the fires in CA and hurricane in TX. So undervalued.
"nice little dividend coming Wednesday. Time to buy and put away, because it may start to rain in the Mid-east."
this professional portfolio manager thinks $SRE is a big opportunity...https://www.twst.com/news/reeves-asset-management-finds-opportunity-dividend-growing-utilities/
In play... they own Oncor in Texas
Added at $132.90
"good dividends, good value. so cal market reliant"
"U.S. LNG cargoes resume shipments to China - Reuters https://seekingalpha.com/news/3559013?source=ansh $CEO, $SNP, $LNG, $SRE, $UNG, $UGAZ, $DGAZ, $BOIL, $KOLD, $UNL, $GAZB, $GAZ Good???? for UGAZ????=)"
"Bloated valuationSouthern Company stock continues to trade at a record valuation. It is trading 20x its estimated earnings against its five-year average valuation of 17x. Based on estimates, Southern Company could return -1% in 2019 and 4% in 2020 YoY. In our view, a 20x multiple for such a slow-growing company looks unjustifiable.The largest utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NEE) is one of the fastest-growing utilities among its peers. NEE is up more than 33% so far this year.NextEra Energy stock also looks to be trading at a significant premium to its historical valuation average. It is currently trading 26x its forward earnings while its five-year average valuation is near 20x."
"I see sre stock, but what is sre-pb? Is it a joint venture? or a preferred stock? Thanks in advance."
"I am not sure who reads this post but it is interesting that the analyst have not addressed one of the Sempra companies being reviewed by California CPUC. The ALJ Fitchs’ ruling seeking comments regarding the findings and actions the Commission should potentially take from the results of the “Upstream and Residential Downstream Lighting Impact Evaluation Report: Lighting Sector –Program Year 2017” impact evaluation report. This is very concerning and the potential fines associated with this ruling. Sempra Energy depends a lot on the earnings associated with the utilities. Source: Order Instituting Rulemaking Concerning Energy Efficiency Rolling Portfolios, Policies, Programs, Evaluation, and Related Issues dated 1-9-2020."
Had this stock since the 60's. Current management is good! also had EXC from the 60's. EXC went to near $100 when the management tried to buy everything in sight without regards to the cost. The dividend was cut and the stock is now in a recovery mode. One is better off with conservative management.
"Might consider buying some SRE-PA before call date. Trading at below par, so you get a discount upon conversion to common shares on Jan 15th. Common share price also dropping, furthering your buying power."
"I've owned this stock for over 10 years and with the dividend and constant growth, it's been the stock that keeps on giving. Couldn't be happier with it."
SRE is down 7.12% to 92.55
"Rolling blackouts coming again this summer here in SoCal. Why? NO POWER PLANTS. There's your green energy. The ""warmers"" live in a make believe world and think electricity just comes out of the wall."
started buying SRE
SRE-PB reached a 52 Week low at 100.20
Fantastic stock. Great things coming. Extremely bright future.
"Ex dividend date today. So this move is expected,."
SRE trading sideways 4 years now. Building a base?
How come you guys didn't tell me about this along time ago? Super happy with this gem of a performer
Sempra is updating its full-year 2021 GAAP EPS guidance range to $7.41 to $8.01 and affirming its full-year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.75 to $8.35. Sempra is also affirming its full-year 2022 EPS guidance range of $8.10 to $8.70.https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18423833-sempra-reports-second-quarter-2021-earnings-results
California regulators approved a plan to mandate solar panels on all new homes built in 2020. Any idea of what impact this will have on SDGE stock?
See you all on green Monday!
Thought we be up more today!
Southern California Gas(SRE)https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/011119-california-natural-gas-storage-in-focus-amid-reliability-challenges-in-us-west
I have a good feeling about my portfolio as the season of earning reports is about to start. The hyped no profit companies will (at least for a moment) go to the corner. And a reliable profitable dividend paying companies like SRE will have their moment.
"I think we are about to see a new bullish market start in nat gas. For nat gas it's cheap, but Cheniere $LNG with the capacity to offload to shipping 2.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf) it's going to start the draw on the stores, with 3 less gas running gas rigs out there will see another large decrease from the previous week in the USA. But we need to know what production from Russia and Canada contributes. Since this ETN's is based on global supplies European nat consumption is a big factor. $SRE is taking 2.1 Bcf per day and with an expansion another 1.4 Bcf. China and Mexico soon to be the biggest customers, I'm sure South Korea is right there too so no change there. The USA is the 3rd largest nat gas producer in the world. We are now a -force to deal with- in the exports as we compete for head-on with Qatar and Russia. We are really energy independent now, thanks to President Trump. We are just now stepping up the exports, but we still want cheap energy here in the USA too. Solar is not cheap. I doubt we will ever see $4.50 per million cubic feet again, but $2.50- $3.00 is in reach, and new construction of nat gas fuel electric generation plants, but those draws will come in the summer. I suspect the futures have overcompensated and new money coming in the market they start buying up the futures. pushing it from $2.20 to $2.40's as the first step up. Right now we hold. We have a 1/10 reverse split coming up and this new adjust cost per share should bring the new money. So I have reason to be bullish. You should find out and do your due diligence. Don't let bias mess wreck your bank. We all want to make money."
What's the news associated with this sharp rise today in SRE? I don't see anything showing.
