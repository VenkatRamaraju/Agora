"Gary Pfizer may have a vaccine, all the personal protective garmit makers are being hit hard Qrtea they belive will not sall as nany goods if people don't have to stay at home. Qrtea should not fall in those categories, I don't fell we will get hurt ,Im using this to pick up more shares,Please do what you fell comfortable with and good luck."
"QRTEA is a major Covid Work from home/stay at home play....yet the market hasn't figured it out yet!! On May 9th on the Q1 earnings call, the CEO basically said Sales across a wide variety of categories and customer engagement including growth in new customers was absolutely RIPPING since the beginning April--Here a few excerpts from this call:-Viewership up over 10%Social media views up over 100%Web traffic to Company websites was up over 30% and even higher among new customersSocial Reach up over 75%Outdoor products up 65% overall inc +70% in Germany and + 100% in the UKCulinary products up over 40%Pool Toys up 100%Bath and Beauty ""Up Strongly""Homemade Food up over 90%I hear from people who work there that the phone continues to ring off the hook and they are having a hard time answering callsSo what do the sleeping dunces on Wall St think?--they are predicting Flat (yes that's correct-FLAT) sales and declining earnings. How is that possible?....answer :they are not paying attention or listening to the Earnings call--frequently staffed on their behalf by very junior staff. This Co has struggled to grow sales since the HSN acquisition-- in fact they have been declining for a few years--well I think that has changed-- they have caught a major secular wind at their back for Covid and this breeze may blow for a several years. QRTEA is a differentiated retailer run by some very shrewd/successful investors in the legendary John Malone and former Microsoft CFO Greg Maffei--they have consistently repurchased stock over the years and will likely keep doing so as long as the market is giving the stock away. This stock--rerated as a modest growth stock ---should be 2-3x higher!"

"Heads up: just got clarification from my broker regarding optionsOption symbol: QRTEA changes to QRTA1Strike prices: NO CHANGE# of Contracts: NO CHANGENew Deliverable per contract: 100 shares of QRTEA, 3 shares of QRTEP, $150 cash ($1.50 x 100)Settlement allocation: QRTEA: 70%, QRTEP: 30%-------------------------------------------That means that yesterday's strike prices DID NOT CHANGE!Take advantage of mis-priced deep in the $ puts now! For example, 9/18 expiry $10 puts are offered at $0.50 instead of $4.12. Huge disconnect - you'll get paid real market price at Friday's expiration even if there are no buyers.Just unbelievable..."
Ready for a big day!!!! To the mooooooon
The industry had a very good run and many employees made millions as a result of strong performance. The Company has lost its' edge and the cause is not AMZN. I would say the company began losing their ability to perform at a high level in 2009 when many key employees who had built outstanding business units left the company. Cord cutting and complacent merchandising and marketing initiatives were replaced by a lack of know how and understanding of the successful model. I am a fan of combining HSN with QVC and Zulily . Maybe they will better understand the need to stabilize and grow new customer names. The model has two key models acquisition and retention of customer base. While broadcast sales are a center piece it is also the most difficult to grow on a new name basis doing more of the same. More innovation is required to drive business and further build the retention model. To the credit of management they have built some highly powerful businesses but without driving acquisition and retention with fresh strategies. They will continue to decline over the long term. Still a lot of potential and in my opinion more acquisition and better distribution are key to returning to a growth model again. At this price it is a hold. Do not however become complacent just because management is picking up some shares.
I thought stockholders were getting the special dividend paid out on the 7th? Did I read this wrong?
14.50 easily
If this hits 8 tomorrow morning... I’m done done
"Why are there two companies, QRTEA and QRTEP? Thanks in advance."
Hello $11.
"How did they come up with a$4,50 price. Let's see if we can buy options on the cheap when opens."
"@landmanre: Here's my thought - best scenario for today is to sell Sept.18 $11, $12, and $13 puts as tomorrow the price will drop by $1.50. It's highly unlikely it'll raise up $1.50 in 4 days."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qurate-retail-inc-reports-second-200500048.html
"Dave are you going to reinvest the dividend orpocket it.I have more than 200 options ,the 8.5s hope im not making a mistake."
hi I'm new here. Why is the drop 40%? I don't see any news only that the ex-div date is today for $1.5/share. but why is the big $4 drop? is this company a good investment any insight appreciated.
"You're all aware the option chains splits tomorrow, right? Sept calls/puts wont matter, but going further out means you're entering a world of dried up option volume."
I just bought 3500 shares The company looks alright what is dip for ?
PS Starwood Hotel's are in a similar position as other hotels with one exception they have enough cash on hand and income. The dividend was not changed exdividend is the same $.48 payable on record as of September 30 th.
"If you have puts, you have to deliver 3 shares/contract of QRTEV and $150/per contract. If I understand this correctly, there was no big windfall. It all squares up like the shares ( distribute , and price goes down accordingly)."
Any idea why the heavy selling today?
Beat beat and beat. Awesome growth and low p/e... Can someone say too the moon!
"This is a very strong stock,I bought back in friday,expecting the stock to drop $1.50 instead made thousands . My advice to all by February 8.5 calls."
PS I also recommend HOME and UNFI. Good luck to all.
"So the company is basically guaranteeing a $1.50/share return on your shares if you hold through August 31? Am I reading this correctly?? If so, this should see a nice run up for the next 3 weeks, then might drop off a cliff on Sept 1?"
"alfrado I do believe you are making a mistake ,now holding 27000 + in stock and options ,this stock is a buy now"
So we met my $13.50 . $15.00 by end of February
"The preferds will correct not, my cup of tea,where can you get s stable company growing with 8% dividend it will bounce back.If it goes low enough even I might invest in it, In the mean time up 10.2% further day."
Looks like we just got pumped and slam dunked
"QRTEA is in a great position for 2021. Streaming and online buying has become the vehicle for buying. Many buyers are now transformed and as the virus winds down they will still buy online. Mall store buying and brick and mortar stores will continue to feel the migration to online buying and streaming! QRTEA will continue to see a smash 2021 quarter 2. The products are right for the retail industries it sells for. It might be ahead of the curve as Netflix streams movies now leading versus going to the movie theaters and risks the new strain viruses. The market has changed, for electronics, clothing, lawnmowers, etc."
Here comes the sell off.
QRTEA is oversold on the daily charts. So it'll go up from now on. I'm thinking un to at least $12 be fore we see a pul back on the daily charts.
"This is going up, P/E of 3 is a joke. The market fails to value correctly its communication bss. Whit a FCF per share of 3,50$. This has a fair price of 30 usd with a pesimistic view. 3.50FCF*10P/E=30-35 usd. They are buying back tons of shares and paying debt back."
"Tell me, those who bought QRTEA shares before 27.08, yesterday 15.09. received dividends and preferred shares?"
"Adam RKT is a service company its been listed for five months, furthermore according to Ameritrade earnings will be cut in half next year ,at the present time and checking the technicals, this is a trade only stock for now, tomorrow who knows,?? Good hunting, find something interesting let me know."
very big disappointment!!!
As I said yesterday the way to go was not the options but was the purchase of the stock. Also for the newbies. Last quarter was only s plus for 6 weeks .Third quarter is a full 12 weeks trading at PE of 2=3 times earnings.
"This should merge with stamps, haha"
"FYI, over25,000 October $12 calls were bought for QRTEA. Somebody with big pockets pretty much knows it'll trade above $12 by mid October."
What is the reason for the low P/E ratio
"Another good quarter, more (780 mill authorized) share buy backs of will support uptrend to new highs."
"Before jumping in all at once cheak out DAC and Cmre. Dac is at 50 + or - going to 75 or 80 Qrtea is great stock but. I s a virus position, and we don't know what's in the company's mind No notice of buy backs this quarter or dividend .That being said I still hold 18000 plus shares ,but I can afford to hold my purchase price was around $5."
I hope you are following what the luckiest guy in the world is duing and copying me . Up 2000 thousand % DAC Qrtea oi ENDP stock and in the money ootions.
"Is this really trading at 2.5x 2020 FCF? Even averaging FCF over last 5 years, it's trading at 4.5x FCF. And don't forget that FCF isn't including dividends paid out. Just bought more."
What is the difference between qrtea and qrteb???
Qurate Retail's (NASDAQ:QRTE.A) investors will be pleased with their decent 77% return over the last year 9/16Kind of a cheesy thing to say when it's down over 5 years
"Just a heads-up: When you subtract the institutional ownership from the float, this stock has implied short interest over 100%.I don’t own yet, as I’m all in on two other value stocks with either similar upside potential or big dividend; but this is a very compelling reason to buy."

What do you guys think this will do tomorrow? Thinking of selling before market close cause I have a feeling it’s going to drop. What do you think?
When will the halt resume?
"This doesn't make sense. QVC, HSN and ZU LILLY are all online retail. Holidays and COVID should equal major increases, but yet the stock is slowly and continually sinking????"
dividend payout after close today?
"Chuck Have owned s lot of shares since $6,00 made a lot of money stock recently not performing technicals not great stock should be up around 15+ I do not like KRAMER but as he would say good company bad stock. Switched most of my profits to zim DAC and GSL up over 1000% on these"
"Let'd have a conversations. On 15th will the price of shares drop $1.50. Assuming it occurs i will sell and purchase in the money 60 day calls. Reason no margin interest, same or leverage. What do you think the price of the shares will 3rd quarter be. Assuming the third quartet is a full 90 days of sales, against a partial 2nd quarter. My estimate for end of year $15 to 20 dollars."
Why is this up nearly 300%? I can’t find any news.
The purpose of exercising the option is to have the shares so that i can receive the $1.50 dividend snd reduce my cost per share to $8.00
Alfredo any advice what i should do with my options going forward??????
"I haven’t bought this yet, but Bill Spetrino recently added it to the Dividend Machine portfolio.It’s one of two stocks currently under his buy price. Everything else in his portfolio has run very high.So be patient. Between new subscribers and people looking to take profits elsewhere, I can see a lot of money coming here."
Still an upward climb but we are clawing our way an inch at a time. Fingers crossed that earnings report signals another dividend and then a climb above $13 for good.
"Come to papa. Monday I get a big check, then it's knockout Q4 earnings."
"It'll take at least a year to get everyone vaccinated, and even that is questionable.On top of this, virus mutates, and they'll have to come up with new versions.The 90% efficacy is fallible - they only test it against one strain of Covid-19.I expect the pandemic to die down only in 2+ years from now."
This is a winner because I bought it!
"katrina Oil is not a long time investment, only a trade . Nobody is going to invest in it in this time period, every one is concerned with climate change l would not hold through election if DEMS win oil companies will drop like a rock, sell the calls you sill makemoney!"
"Why 6 to 8 months?Vaccine will take time to be distributed and used.Also did you read the transcript the compamy aspects to be sble to keep most of their new customer's, OS if you believe what you just said i would get out today ,it eill correct sufficiently so you will be able to get out with minimal damage."
A 5-10% drop was probably justified but a 27% drop creates a buying opportunity.
Nobody talking about this stock since 18 days ago???
"Gary Did you see what happened on Friday for the last 20 minutes. Shares went to plus from minus, and in the last five minutes over to million shares were traded on the upside,T that point I sold every thing and went into December 6 options ,aside from my interest bearing a count I own 113 December 6 options. This is my filing and I betting my all."
One of the most undervalued stocks I've analyzed in a long time. Great Qtr!
Earning per share for this quarter 0.35... Thia make per year 1.4 this make P/E8.6 only... Keep in mind repurchase of stocks was great
This looks like it’s headed back to $28
CM those in the money calls should be short term one to two months very small premiums can roll over easily no interest.
"Anonomys Apt short term is okay might look at weekly to give a little more time. Would buy the 9 s in the money can always role sane with march 19 s.Doing the same with qrtea march 10s sorry I didn't get back to you sooner busy day ,lots of good purchases, check out HBI EAf teck and UMC. Good hunting may the force be with you."
Larry lets let's assume you are correct. Then what are the possibilities. #1 There is a possibility that the drop in price after the announcement was the adjustment. #2 The stock should go up monday on all the upgrades. Short term profit. #3 My position i have 2700 share + 7 oct 9 calls. Monday am buy all the additional calls with what i have cash in market now.( no additional ) take advantage of any short term gains sell all options if it makes sence
I am new to QRTEA and have a question. With so much debt why the special dividends from time to time?
What is the record date snd the payment dateShoud i convert my options to shares????????
Looks like MM deducted $4.50 dividend as an opening price?
"Earnings are great and the news will come out after closing....I am buying all I can before the close today....BUY BUY now, or say bye bye to easy profits....remember me in your will."
This is the 1st time that I’ve seen that because of the distribution of dividend making the stock loose this much of value. Is there any other underlying cause on top of this?
How does a special dividen affect the price of a option.
When can i sell the stock and still get my dividend. September 1st or sept 15th
"Tried to buy option's ,they will not allow me????"
"Buy downside protection while it's cheap... VIX or SPXS, etc..."
Cmon this is getting old!
Anybody alive on this board. I must be the only one intrested. Maybe I'm the only one making any money here. Oh well today's the day before earnings?
"Tell me, maybe I missed something .. why they stopped paying dividends on Series A since December there have been no payments. The current is sent by R and very little.."
Does anyone know how the preferred shares will be distributed and how we will be notified as to how many we get and any other details we need to manage them??
"About Pfizer's vaccine...ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, BRITAIN""This vaccine needs to be stored at -80c. This could create major logistical challenges for mass treatment outside major urban areas and in low or middle income countries.""This is DOA compared to room-temperature vaccines. How are they going to keep it at -80 degrees celcius? Only large hospitals/institutions can have such equipment. Forget about it, nothing to see here...Russian vaccine works fine at room temperature. #$%$"
Nice after hour movement. Should be $12 by year end
"Have you ever heard the saying slow and steady is a winner .If you go back and follow my commentary, I started February 12 at home with a diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer. With an investment of ;$6500 now worth $23000 .In the oast in the late80s and 90s I invested and made over one million dollar ln the market unfortunately in 2003 lost it investing in real estate development. So to end this I repeat slow an steady wind the race stay with qrtea and if you wish teck. Have a good day."
Hedge Funds were holding a record # of QRTEA shares in Q2:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-qurate-165222956.html
"Collect dividend on 16 buy new oct 9 calls. Cell calls two days before expiration. Get out of market before election ,market will go crazy, no matter who winds. QVC earnings November 12 get back in if markets are calm,if not buy the cheapest in the money options you can this is a $20. stock. PS buying in the money options gives you similar leverage to margin with no interest ,You can rollover if need to. In my opinion is safer then marginBuy one ore two options on something your interested in,ant get comfortable with options"
"remember y'all when this pays out the special dividend, it will drop $1.5/share"
"Gary remember when doing what I do, never buy out of the money options that's gambling, by buying in the money small premium, and if the market goes against you ,then you still can roll over ,and wait the turn around in you have faith, in your position."
Lots of volume in the 1st hour of trade. Seems like a good beat on ER this afternoon. Good luck to all. I think Zulily could be a good catalyst for this one.
Thrilled to have bought in below $7. Home shopping network is the perfect retailer for the quarantined. They will only showcase product in supply and actually benefit from people's fear of crowds in malls.
"All yesterday's strike prices stay the same, Ameritrade just adjusted its option chains.Those who sold puts up to yesterday will need to pony up shares + $ at the strike price, not adjusted price!"
"So the consensus EBITDA estimates for QRTEA both 2020 and 2021 are $2,050 million. Subtract $375 mil for interest, $200 mil for CapX, $100 mil for taxes and now $100 mil for Pref Stock Divs and you get Equity Free Cash Flow of $1,275 million divide that by 415 mil shares and you get $3.07 per share in equity free cash flow per common share. At the current $7 stock price range, this means QRTEA is trading at 2.3X free cash flow!!! I challenge you to find a Co this size with a modest growth outlook trading anywhere near this equity free cash flow multiple.But the story gets better--the Co just paid a $633 mil special dividend--of which 41% was financed from the sale of a Green investment which no outside shareholder had any idea about--the equivalent of finding it in a drawer. So the quarter started with $948 mill in cash add the $262 mil and then subtract the $633 mil and you get $577 mil pro forma at June 30th. As shown above I expect the Co to generate of $1,275 over coming 4 quarters (actually i think the EBITDA will be higher based on Mgt commentary )If we assume they keep $577 mil around for liquidity purposes then that means they can use the $1,275 mil to buy back stock which I just showed you will generate a 44% return (if the stock doesnt move). If they try and buy back 44% of the stock, the stock will move higher- likely significantly higher- both from the signaling effect (they won't buy this much stock unless they are confident in the future and think stock is really cheap) and the technical reaction to more demand and less supply. If the business has the momentum i think it does then this is a historical no-brainer. The effect of the Pref Stock/common stock bifurcation was to lever the Co up a bit more --which admittedly does have some risk--but if the revenues keep growing and HSN cost reduction integration is on target (mgt says yes) then this corporate finance strategy meaningfully enhances the upside of the common."
Can not find any stock FWIW
"As I said in previous posts on the 18th tomorrow, I will make a major change in portfolio. Will explane my changes late afternoon or as things develop. As of now I hold in this account 150 shares APT, 4600 shares QRTEA, and 2600 shares of TECK."
I was correct about buying this morning...My advice is to buy at open and enjoy the run up....We are going to have a GREAT day tomorrow.
It will rise again from now ;)
"interestingly since my post below 6 days ago, one of the Wall St ""research analysts"" increased their sales and earnings estimates for Q2 such that they now expect a 2% rise in sales vs Q2 last year--guess they read my post--its sad what St Research has become--the trick to making money is to identify situations where the expectations are inaccurate and position yourself accordingly--its a shame when the mgt team gets up on a box and basically screams what is happening and the St can't be awoken from their nap to listen and adjust their view. The stock is up 20% in the 6 days since I posted-- its going to $15 post Aug 10 Q2 earnings report My bet is Revenues will up a lot more than than the 2% the Street expects--and the commentary will be encouraging--- my guess is also that it won't be overly optimistic because Messrs Malone and Maffei want to buy a lot more shares back at these prices--time to put your space suit on--its going to be a fun ride!"
Today's drop is overreacting... Good time to buy for quick 10%
how can a stock be down 38% in pre and only one person notices? not many shareholders here I guess.what is going on???????
"This is my 8th month at home. It's also my holiday,and I'm lucky to be alive.On February 18th I was DIAGNOSED with Pancreatic cancer, Its been a terrible 8 months but I am confident I will be all right. I hope I have been helpful. To everyone may I wish you all a happy healthy and prosperous New Year."

"special divvy for 1.50 and also regular divvy for 2.01 payable Dec 7th, Dec 15th respectively"
what's up qrtea? why is it down so hard?
Sitting at 200 DMA on 3 month. Barchart says 88% STRONG BUY on all indicators.
"Not sure why there isn't more interest in the Preferreds, 8% is pretty good dividend rate for a quality company. Sure they have a call feature at $104, so if they get called, pay you $104/share."
what happen i fell asleep ?
"Been calculating the fundamentals of this company such as cash flow ratio, cash flow/share in addition to looking at their earnings and balance sheet and the same question keeps coming to my mind, why and how is the share of this company this cheap?"
BofA just upgraded QRTEA to a buy with a price target of $16
The management is not doing a good job to promote their products.

Qurate Retail is down 7.27% to 10.71
"Alfredo Just spoke to TDAmeritrade, was told im looklih at this wrong. Selling the options will give me a pro6 of about $60 ,how ever if i exercise as many as i can each option will make me $200 , Naturally i don't have a 150000 in cash . But i can sell some stock exercise as much as i can ,sell the balance of my options and purchase stock outright. Hope this makes sense to you"
anyone seen the big drop after hours? is it just me?
"Richard, I think you are looking at this incorrectly. Here is my situation. I only have 30 Dec 18 8 calls that I paid about $1 per contract ($1 X 100 shares/contract X 30 = $3000 approx) Now these options are worth $2.02. So if I sell I get 2.02 X 100 shares/contract X 30 = $6060 approx). If I exercise these options now at $8.00 and the stock is lets say rounded up to $10/share. I then sell these shares, I make $2/ share X 3000 shares that I would own = $6000 - what I paid for the options $1 X 100 shares/contract X 30 contracts = $3000. So you see it is exactly the same if you exercise now or you cash in the options without exercising. Your profit is the same. The TD guy is wrong. I'm not sure what the tax implications are either way, but I think they are both short term gains you you will get the max tax either way."
My October 9 options are + $650. But know bid and an ask of$1.80.What does all this mean?????
"Massive sale after dividend date-> Oversale -> underestimated price-> more sale (panic/option-related) -> discountThis is my explanation so far, and I'm seeing the price going back up by two digits percentage within today.Any other possibility that I've not counted in?"
Wish we had a cash bump on stock!
This is not worth it! Does absolutely nothing on great earnings beat been downhill ever since that small jump...
"Peter have you heard something I haven't. St one point owned 15000 shares. now down to 6000, Qrtea has not done anything for 8 monthsPurchased most of my shares between 6 and 7 so am doing rather well.A lot of hype no movement maybe it's time to move on????"
Premarket tomorrow over 18.00
"Another day like this, and $10 Sept.18 put will be going up by double digits."
"So, I'm fully convinced that the only way this stock is going to see and maintain anything above $11 is for the buybacks to happen."
"There is no news to excite buyers, I reduced my 18000 position to 7000 and increased my position on microchips and increased my position in container ships,with blockage of Suez Canal this is an absolute winner no brainer."

Rrmrmber the price will drop friday bg at least $1.50 or more. Sold and took profits todau due to extreme concentration Will be back in on Friday looking to purchase the options the 8 pr 9s December ot January.
What you think about QVC being on Youtube TV?
"If you think $VIAC has had it rough, check out these two:1. $QRTEA (Home Shopping, Zulily): forward PE under 5 and get this: 104% institutional ownership of float + 6% short (over 21M shares). This one could be fun.2. $NLS (Nautilus): forward PE under 8. Argus has a sell rating with $1 PT (currently over $14). 82% institutional ownership, almost 5M shares short.I don’t own either yet; would have to go into savings to do so as all my brokerage accts are loaded with positions I’m nowhere near selling; won’t use margin either. Maybe I’ll look at OOTM calls expiring 2023."
Larry did you read the up grades. What has changed from last quarter. Last quarter we had over 100% increase for 6 weeks stay at Homer's. This quarter we have a full 12 weeks.
Alfredo how do they compinsate the option holder for the dividend
reason to buy ...Dividends are huge
"Francisco Parames bought this shares and if u see the fundamentals, P/FCF is very low, P/E is also low. At the end of the day what makes value for investor is the ability of the companie to make FCF. This is a machine of cash making."
9000 shares
this is great let it go down more and let them buy back shares at these prices. this gives a much better return than dividend!!
Wow great earnings
"this is how I see it about commons. Company wasn't doing that great and business model is last century but covid came and Qurate finally got a break and increase in revenue which didn't translate into increase in earnings due to extra expenses but might next few Q. They have sold green energy investment and paid proceeds as dividends and attached preffs to it, do they have nice liquidity. This is oversold presently but wouldn't hold it long-term despite over 95% institutional ownership"
I’m NOT happy at all with this stock.
"The scariest thing on my agenda is the election, in the case of QRTEA it doesn't matter who wins it will prosper.All indications are for good earnings, the rest don't matter."
Alfrado I do not like interest either. But think about it how much interest do i pay for the next eight days as compared to the anount of dividend i am going to receive
"Just my humble opinion, but this is the classic stay at home stock: QVC, Zulily, HSN. The holiday season is around the corner and folks are going to be online ordering at record paces. This is down, but definitely not out."
The market usually values equities accurately. Can anyone explain how the current price is an accurate value for this company?
"Cheap price, clear buy"
"Hats off to you Gary,What a call .Now it's my turn purchased stock this AM now have 5000 shares."
"FYI, many brokers have 1 settlement day - meaning if you buy today, you'll be on record on Monday.Those who sell today will NOT get a dividend."
I was told that you recieve the dividend if you hold past the ex dividend date and to my knowledge was November 27the is that correcte.?????
"I was worried after buying on margin yesterday that after hours looked gloomy, so happy, nice move so far"
So this company just robbed me... cool
Nice day. Something to build upon for tomorrow

? Why is everyone talking bad about this company am I missing something this stock has been going up all day long are we expecting a major downfall on this company that I don’t know about? Someone please respond educate me a bit on this company￼￼￼￼
I am bargain shopping at Qurate...for their shares! Good prices to accumulate for the long term ( > 6 months)....
"Question: If you buy this now, too late for special dividend. So if you missed that, why would anybody buy this now? Will go down $1.50 after special dividend is paid out?"
"Wow even though suppliers very upset, didn’t see this coming."
External report is key to where the stock is going I don’t think there’s much downside but a good next quarter and put it in the teens
"For the record i convered all my options, and hold 26200 shares"
Reduced my holding to 4000 shares.
Cheap price picked up another 500 shares 12-13 buy February 10 th then its decision time.
For every $10 put contract that is not covered by shares. You will get $1000 in cash.And the broker will short 100 shares of A and 3 shares of P and take $150You have to buy back the shares to cover the short. So you losses money above A price of $5.5 per share but that would be out the money and would not exercise.
Alfredo I'm with you
CM have been in since 5 + - the two $1.50 dividends was great but without some future stimulus this is going nowhere .had 18000 pluse shares recently lowered to around 7000
"Hoping this moves for the better! I jumped in at $18. If not, I’m in it for the long haul. Though, I prefer to not go bald!"
"What is going on today, no news ?????"
