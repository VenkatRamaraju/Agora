"Options Example Ihave $5000 to invest price of stock today $11.82 . 5000 on margin 3.33 x 5009= $16650buying power or 1408 shares . $5000 cash February 8.5 s option's. =3.40 each =14 options which controls 1400 shares. so you have greater leverage a slightly lesser cash participation and no margin interest. Now you purchased in yhe money options sgock goes against you in February stock price drops ,you losy a small amount of your investment, but can now roll over to march and still be in game. Questions any body"

"Just a heads-up: When you subtract the institutional ownership from the float, this stock has implied short interest over 100%.I don’t own yet, as I’m all in on two other value stocks with either similar upside potential or big dividend; but this is a very compelling reason to buy."
this is great let it go down more and let them buy back shares at these prices. this gives a much better return than dividend!!
"Hoping that the share price continues up through friday, it should with black friday sales and cyber monday sales looming. Then if the buybacks are productive and with the gift giving season, we possibly could be looking at $14 to $15 by New Years."

"@landmanre: Here's my thought - best scenario for today is to sell Sept.18 $11, $12, and $13 puts as tomorrow the price will drop by $1.50. It's highly unlikely it'll raise up $1.50 in 4 days."
Terrific earnings report. Going to $15

"Let'd have a conversations. On 15th will the price of shares drop $1.50. Assuming it occurs i will sell and purchase in the money 60 day calls. Reason no margin interest, same or leverage. What do you think the price of the shares will 3rd quarter be. Assuming the third quartet is a full 90 days of sales, against a partial 2nd quarter. My estimate for end of year $15 to 20 dollars."
"This is a very strong stock,I bought back in friday,expecting the stock to drop $1.50 instead made thousands . My advice to all by February 8.5 calls."
Larry did you read the up grades. What has changed from last quarter. Last quarter we had over 100% increase for 6 weeks stay at Homer's. This quarter we have a full 12 weeks.
hi I'm new here. Why is the drop 40%? I don't see any news only that the ex-div date is today for $1.5/share. but why is the big $4 drop? is this company a good investment any insight appreciated.
The purpose of exercising the option is to have the shares so that i can receive the $1.50 dividend snd reduce my cost per share to $8.00
Larry lets let's assume you are correct. Then what are the possibilities. #1 There is a possibility that the drop in price after the announcement was the adjustment. #2 The stock should go up monday on all the upgrades. Short term profit. #3 My position i have 2700 share + 7 oct 9 calls. Monday am buy all the additional calls with what i have cash in market now.( no additional ) take advantage of any short term gains sell all options if it makes sence
I just bought 3500 shares The company looks alright what is dip for ?
got in this week ..
"Sold 20000 took profits, still in for 18500 shares"

I was told that you recieve the dividend if you hold past the ex dividend date and to my knowledge was November 27the is that correcte.?????
QRTEA reached a 52 Week low at 4.92
"FYI, many brokers have 1 settlement day - meaning if you buy today, you'll be on record on Monday.Those who sell today will NOT get a dividend."
"See obvious short term problems ,Sold my 60 Oct 16 options, Mostlikly did not need to. Did add 3500 shares. Stock ls log time hold ,When everything quiets down after elections will add options. To much unsertiny in this time period for stocks."
I thought stockholders were getting the special dividend paid out on the 7th? Did I read this wrong?
Nice after hour movement. Should be $12 by year end
"This is my 8th month at home.

"Heads up: just got clarification from my broker regarding optionsOption symbol: QRTEA changes to QRTA1Strike prices: NO CHANGE# of Contracts: NO CHANGENew Deliverable per contract: 100 shares of QRTEA, 3 shares of QRTEP, $150 cash ($1.50 x 100)Settlement allocation: QRTEA: 70%, QRTEP: 30%-------------------------------------------That means that yesterday's strike prices DID NOT CHANGE!Take advantage of mis-priced deep in the $ puts now! For example, 9/18 expiry $10 puts are offered at $0.50 instead of $4.12. Huge disconnect - you'll get paid real market price at Friday's expiration even if there are no buyers.Just unbelievable..."

Got at least another 50 cents to go down from here. I'm looking to buy at $9.50
It will rise again from now ;)
This is a winner because I bought it!
"If you have puts, you have to deliver 3 shares/contract of QRTEV and $150/per contract. If I understand this correctly, there was no big windfall. It all squares up like the shares ( distribute , and price goes down accordingly)."
"Peter have you heard something I haven't. St one point owned 15000 shares. now down to 6000, Qrtea has not done anything for 8 monthsPurchased most of my shares between 6 and 7 so am doing rather well.A lot of hype no movement maybe it's time to move on????"

How does a special dividen affect the price of a option.
they need to pay divided with all that cash flow
Earning per share for this quarter 0.35... Thia make per year 1.4 this make P/E8.6 only... Keep in mind repurchase of stocks was great
"PS Adam I intend to hold until election,go into 50%cash .and prepared to jump back in full throttle. I believe earnings is the 5th AM and it will very good."
Nice action today. Light volume and price is going up.
"interestingly since my post below 6 days ago, one of the Wall St ""research analysts"" increased their sales and earnings estimates for Q2 such that they now expect a 2% rise in sales vs Q2 last year--guess they read my post--its sad what St Research has become--the trick to making money is to identify situations where the expectations are inaccurate and position yourself accordingly--its a shame when the mgt team gets up on a box and basically screams what is happening and the St can't be awoken from their nap to listen and adjust their view. The stock is up 20% in the 6 days since I posted-- its going to $15 post Aug 10 Q2 earnings report My bet is Revenues will up a lot more than than the 2% the Street expects--and the commentary will be encouraging--- my guess is also that it won't be overly optimistic because Messrs Malone and Maffei want to buy a lot more shares back at these prices--time to put your space suit on--its going to be a fun ride!"
Today's drop is overreacting... Good time to buy for quick 10%
Reduced my holding to 4000 shares.
Sitting at 200 DMA on 3 month. Barchart says 88% STRONG BUY on all indicators.
Thrilled to have bought in below $7. Home shopping network is the perfect retailer for the quarantined. They will only showcase product in supply and actually benefit from people's fear of crowds in malls.
"Why 6 to 8 months?Vaccine will take time to be distributed and used.Also did you read the transcript the compamy aspects to be sble to keep most of their new customer's, OS if you believe what you just said i would get out today ,it eill correct sufficiently so you will be able to get out with minimal damage."
"I haven’t bought this yet, but Bill Spetrino recently added it to the Dividend Machine portfolio.It’s one of two stocks currently under his buy price. Everything else in his portfolio has run very high.So be patient. Between new subscribers and people looking to take profits elsewhere, I can see a lot of money coming here."
The industry had a very good run and many employees made millions as a result of strong performance. The Company has lost its' edge and the cause is not AMZN. I would say the company began losing their ability to perform at a high level in 2009 when many key employees who had built outstanding business units left the company. Cord cutting and complacent merchandising and marketing initiatives were replaced by a lack of know how and understanding of the successful model. I am a fan of combining HSN with QVC and Zulily . Maybe they will better understand the need to stabilize and grow new customer names. The model has two key models acquisition and retention of customer base. While broadcast sales are a center piece it is also the most difficult to grow on a new name basis doing more of the same. More innovation is required to drive business and further build the retention model. To the credit of management they have built some highly powerful businesses but without driving acquisition and retention with fresh strategies. They will continue to decline over the long term. Still a lot of potential and in my opinion more acquisition and better distribution are key to returning to a growth model again. At this price it is a hold. Do not however become complacent just because management is picking up some shares.
The management is not doing a good job to promote their products.
Just purchased 7 calls Oct 9s for 1.85 28 cent cent premium letssee what happens
"Tell me, maybe I missed something .. why they stopped paying dividends on Series A since December there have been no payments. The current is sent by R and very little.."
This is not worth it! Does absolutely nothing on great earnings beat been downhill ever since that small jump...
"Been calculating the fundamentals of this company such as cash flow ratio, cash flow/share in addition to looking at their earnings and balance sheet and the same question keeps coming to my mind, why and how is the share of this company this cheap?"
"The scariest thing on my agenda is the election, in the case of QRTEA it doesn't matter who wins it will prosper.All indications are for good earnings, the rest don't matter."
What is the reason for the low P/E ratio

"Alfredo Just spoke to TDAmeritrade, was told im looklih at this wrong. Selling the options will give me a pro6 of about $60 ,how ever if i exercise as many as i can each option will make me $200 , Naturally i don't have a 150000 in cash . But i can sell some stock exercise as much as i can ,sell the balance of my options and purchase stock outright. Hope this makes sense to you"
HUGE MISS..... GRTEA will be down 20% tomorrow..... Time to sell....
My October 9 options are + $650. But know bid and an ask of$1.80.What does all this mean?????
"Man there is close to 2,000,000 shares being shorted at 7.00 and under. I would hate to be in there shoes beating revenue in a pandemic and xmas shopping season coming. Beat revenue of last year and it was at 12 bucks.."
"Collect dividend on 16 buy new oct 9 calls. Cell calls two days before expiration. Get out of market before election ,market will go crazy, no matter who winds. QVC earnings November 12 get back in if markets are calm,if not buy the cheapest in the money options you can this is a $20. stock. PS buying in the money options gives you similar leverage to margin with no interest ,You can rollover if need to. In my opinion is safer then marginBuy one ore two options on something your interested in,ant get comfortable with options"
Looks like we just got pumped and slam dunked
I don't understand why there is NO PE ratio listed where I see solid income? Can anyone give me a quick response?
what's up qrtea? why is it down so hard?
This will be at 11 by the end of the day
All I need is this madarchaud to go back to $9... anyone see that happening?
"U are not lucky L, but you are on amazing run. I am a follower and bought ORTEA Friday and did a Feb call today for $11.50 for $1.00 on a limit bid, just got it. I might pick up Endo Tomorrow cause I like the Feb calls also; not sure the strike price, don't go in the money much. I am looking at DAC, a little rich for me now. Well done L and good health to you as always!"
"alfrado I do believe you are making a mistake ,now holding 27000 + in stock and options ,this stock is a buy now"
"For all you holding puts....You can sell to close now, but since they are illiquid, you will get screwed. Or you can hold until assigned at which time you will hold a short position in QRTEA. To relieve yourself of said short position, you will have to provide $0.03/ share of QRTEP and $1.5 cash per share. So to simplify this, let's say $450/contract. Now if that time the strike is higher than the actual price ( for example strike is 12 and price is 6), you will net $600-$450 + $150 per contract. NOT $600per contract. Capice?"
Still an upward climb but we are clawing our way an inch at a time. Fingers crossed that earnings report signals another dividend and then a climb above $13 for good.
"If you think $VIAC has had it rough, check out these two:1. $QRTEA (Home Shopping, Zulily): forward PE under 5 and get this: 104% institutional ownership of float + 6% short (over 21M shares). This one could be fun.2. $NLS (Nautilus): forward PE under 8. Argus has a sell rating with $1 PT (currently over $14). 82% institutional ownership, almost 5M shares short.I don’t own either yet; would have to go into savings to do so as all my brokerage accts are loaded with positions I’m nowhere near selling; won’t use margin either. Maybe I’ll look at OOTM calls expiring 2023."
Tomorrow will be $25

"Before jumping in all at once cheak out DAC and Cmre. Dac is at 50 + or - going to 75 or 80 Qrtea is great stock but. I s a virus position, and we don't know what's in the company's mind No notice of buy backs this quarter or dividend .That being said I still hold 18000 plus shares ,but I can afford to hold my purchase price was around $5."
This is the 1st time that I’ve seen that because of the distribution of dividend making the stock loose this much of value. Is there any other underlying cause on top of this?
Ht pays .43% dividend???STAY also pays almost no dividend and has a PE of 27???????
"Richard, I think you are looking at this incorrectly. Here is my situation. I only have 30 Dec 18 8 calls that I paid about $1 per contract ($1 X 100 shares/contract X 30 = $3000 approx) Now these options are worth $2.02. So if I sell I get 2.02 X 100 shares/contract X 30 = $6060 approx). If I exercise these options now at $8.00 and the stock is lets say rounded up to $10/share. I then sell these shares, I make $2/ share X 3000 shares that I would own = $6000 - what I paid for the options $1 X 100 shares/contract X 30 contracts = $3000. So you see it is exactly the same if you exercise now or you cash in the options without exercising. Your profit is the same. The TD guy is wrong. I'm not sure what the tax implications are either way, but I think they are both short term gains you you will get the max tax either way."
"Anonomys Apt short term is okay might look at weekly to give a little more time. Would buy the 9 s in the money can always role sane with march 19 s.Doing the same with qrtea march 10s sorry I didn't get back to you sooner busy day ,lots of good purchases, check out HBI EAf teck and UMC. Good hunting may the force be with you."
"There is no news to excite buyers, I reduced my 18000 position to 7000 and increased my position on microchips and increased my position in container ships,with blockage of Suez Canal this is an absolute winner no brainer."
why do you think that this will be repeated tomorrow... Lets look at this.. If you rob a bank will you come back tomorrow and do it again. Noooo. Thats what happened today. people got 300% return on their investment while some others will have to work for 6 months to recoup. But hey its only money as I see from people comments. just go back to work and get more. Then try again. tomorrow the rest of the money will be taken off since the stock is still double since opening. and rest will go crying home. Stay away.
"Another good quarter, more (780 mill authorized) share buy backs of will support uptrend to new highs."

"Just my humble opinion, but this is the classic stay at home stock: QVC, Zulily, HSN. The holiday season is around the corner and folks are going to be online ordering at record paces. This is down, but definitely not out."
Garry big mistake
"QRTEA is a major Covid Work from home/stay at home play....yet the market hasn't figured it out yet!! On May 9th on the Q1 earnings call, the CEO basically said Sales across a wide variety of categories and customer engagement including growth in new customers was absolutely RIPPING since the beginning April--Here a few excerpts from this call:-Viewership up over 10%Social media views up over 100%Web traffic to Company websites was up over 30% and even higher among new customersSocial Reach up over 75%Outdoor products up 65% overall inc +70% in Germany and + 100% in the UKCulinary products up over 40%Pool Toys up 100%Bath and Beauty ""Up Strongly""Homemade Food up over 90%I hear from people who work there that the phone continues to ring off the hook and they are having a hard time answering callsSo what do the sleeping dunces on Wall St think?--they are predicting Flat (yes that's correct-FLAT) sales and declining earnings. How is that possible?....answer :they are not paying attention or listening to the Earnings call--frequently staffed on their behalf by very junior staff. This Co has struggled to grow sales since the HSN acquisition-- in fact they have been declining for a few years--well I think that has changed-- they have caught a major secular wind at their back for Covid and this breeze may blow for a several years. QRTEA is a differentiated retailer run by some very shrewd/successful investors in the legendary John Malone and former Microsoft CFO Greg Maffei--they have consistently repurchased stock over the years and will likely keep doing so as long as the market is giving the stock away. This stock--rerated as a modest growth stock ---should be 2-3x higher!"
Rrmrmber the price will drop friday bg at least $1.50 or more. Sold and took profits todau due to extreme concentration Will be back in on Friday looking to purchase the options the 8 pr 9s December ot January.

So frustrated with this stock. It is as if Malone is ignoring it.
Qurate Retail reached a 52 Week high at 12.67
"Come to papa. Monday I get a big check, then it's knockout Q4 earnings."
When will the halt resume?
For every $10 put contract that is not covered by shares. You will get $1000 in cash.And the broker will short 100 shares of A and 3 shares of P and take $150You have to buy back the shares to cover the short. So you losses money above A price of $5.5 per share but that would be out the money and would not exercise.
"Buy downside protection while it's cheap... VIX or SPXS, etc..."
Why is this up nearly 300%? I can’t find any news.
"Hoping this moves for the better! I jumped in at $18. If not, I’m in it for the long haul. Though, I prefer to not go bald!"
PS I also recommend HOME and UNFI. Good luck to all.
"Tried to buy option's ,they will not allow me????"
My money says this will drop more the the $1.50 on distribution day. It did last time.
QRTEB reached a 52 Week low at 4.96
Alfredo took you advice sold 80 options
"QRTEA is in a great position for 2021. Streaming and online buying has become the vehicle for buying. Many buyers are now transformed and as the virus winds down they will still buy online. Mall store buying and brick and mortar stores will continue to feel the migration to online buying and streaming! QRTEA will continue to see a smash 2021 quarter 2. The products are right for the retail industries it sells for. It might be ahead of the curve as Netflix streams movies now leading versus going to the movie theaters and risks the new strain viruses. The market has changed, for electronics, clothing, lawnmowers, etc."
External report is key to where the stock is going I don’t think there’s much downside but a good next quarter and put it in the teens
Lost 37% on Pre-market??? :-O
Any idea why the heavy selling today?
What is going on
"cm look at substituting some in the money options ,good leverage no margin no interest"
"Game changer will be buying in the money option's, all i can afford."
"Tell me, those who bought QRTEA shares before 27.08, yesterday 15.09. received dividends and preferred shares?"
Qurate Retail is down 7.27% to 10.71
Qurate Retail's (NASDAQ:QRTE.A) investors will be pleased with their decent 77% return over the last year 9/16Kind of a cheesy thing to say when it's down over 5 years
I am new to QRTEA and have a question. With so much debt why the special dividends from time to time?
QRTEA is oversold on the daily charts. So it'll go up from now on. I'm thinking un to at least $12 be fore we see a pul back on the daily charts.
beat estimates and a new 52 week high
One of the most undervalued stocks I've analyzed in a long time. Great Qtr!
"Not sure why there isn't more interest in the Preferreds, 8% is pretty good dividend rate for a quality company. Sure they have a call feature at $104, so if they get called, pay you $104/share."
"It is a good timing to buy QRTEA now. If I were the owner, I will use buy back."
Wish we had a cash bump on stock!
"Massive sale after dividend date-> Oversale -> underestimated price-> more sale (panic/option-related) -> discountThis is my explanation so far, and I'm seeing the price going back up by two digits percentage within today.Any other possibility that I've not counted in?"
I was correct about buying this morning...My advice is to buy at open and enjoy the run up....We are going to have a GREAT day tomorrow.
Check out AVID. New position on QRTEA 4000 shares + 31 October 6.
"FYI, over25,000 October $12 calls were bought for QRTEA. Somebody with big pockets pretty much knows it'll trade above $12 by mid October."

"Gary Did you see what happened on Friday for the last 20 minutes. Shares went to plus from minus, and in the last five minutes over to million shares were traded on the upside,T that point I sold every thing and went into December 6 options ,aside from my interest bearing a count I own 113 December 6 options. This is my filing and I betting my all."
"Adam RKT is a service company its been listed for five months, furthermore according to Ameritrade earnings will be cut in half next year ,at the present time and checking the technicals, this is a trade only stock for now, tomorrow who knows,?? Good hunting, find something interesting let me know."
CM those in the money calls should be short term one to two months very small premiums can roll over easily no interest.
"Why are there two companies, QRTEA and QRTEP? Thanks in advance."
David please explain
Any thoughts?https://ir.qurateretail.com/news-releases/news-release-details/qurate-retail-inc-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results
"Had an interesting day today was not abel to follow the market . Drove from N Y to PA for holiday . Just out of New Hope a tree fell on the car while driving, what a mess luckey to be alive no physical personal damage .Very scary."
"this is how I see it about commons. Company wasn't doing that great and business model is last century but covid came and Qurate finally got a break and increase in revenue which didn't translate into increase in earnings due to extra expenses but might next few Q. They have sold green energy investment and paid proceeds as dividends and attached preffs to it, do they have nice liquidity. This is oversold presently but wouldn't hold it long-term despite over 95% institutional ownership"
back up the truck at $17

"This doesn't make sense. QVC, HSN and ZU LILLY are all online retail. Holidays and COVID should equal major increases, but yet the stock is slowly and continually sinking????"
"Have you ever heard the saying slow and steady is a winner .If you go back and follow my commentary, I started February 12 at home with a diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer. With an investment of ;$6500 now worth $23000 .In the oast in the late80s and 90s I invested and made over one million dollar ln the market unfortunately in 2003 lost it investing in real estate development. So to end this I repeat slow an steady wind the race stay with qrtea and if you wish teck. Have a good day."
Good morning wats going on today.
Anybody alive on this board. I must be the only one intrested. Maybe I'm the only one making any money here. Oh well today's the day before earnings?
"From investor's relations, you must hold stock past Sep 15th to receive dividends. IR # 7208755400"
"The preferds will correct not, my cup of tea,where can you get s stable company growing with 8% dividend it will bounce back.If it goes low enough even I might invest in it, In the mean time up 10.2% further day."
Alfrado I do not like interest either. But think about it how much interest do i pay for the next eight days as compared to the anount of dividend i am going to receive
R.I.P. to everyone who bought over 18 a share earlier. Doesn’t look like it’ll be up past that again for a while if not ever. Not sure how that happened but oh well 
I am accumulating stock and july 7 and 8 options also have 1500 shares. will sell at 25
"I was worried after buying on margin yesterday that after hours looked gloomy, so happy, nice move so far"
If this hits 8 tomorrow morning... I’m done done
"So the consensus EBITDA estimates for QRTEA both 2020 and 2021 are $2,050 million. Subtract $375 mil for interest, $200 mil for CapX, $100 mil for taxes and now $100 mil for Pref Stock Divs and you get Equity Free Cash Flow of $1,275 million divide that by 415 mil shares and you get $3.07 per share in equity free cash flow per common share. At the current $7 stock price range, this means QRTEA is trading at 2.3X free cash flow!!! I challenge you to find a Co this size with a modest growth outlook trading anywhere near this equity free cash flow multiple.But the story gets better--the Co just paid a $633 mil special dividend--of which 41% was financed from the sale of a Green investment which no outside shareholder had any idea about--the equivalent of finding it in a drawer. So the quarter started with $948 mill in cash add the $262 mil and then subtract the $633 mil and you get $577 mil pro forma at June 30th. As shown above I expect the Co to generate of $1,275 over coming 4 quarters (actually i think the EBITDA will be higher based on Mgt commentary )If we assume they keep $577 mil around for liquidity purposes then that means they can use the $1,275 mil to buy back stock which I just showed you will generate a 44% return (if the stock doesnt move). If they try and buy back 44% of the stock, the stock will move higher- likely significantly higher- both from the signaling effect (they won't buy this much stock unless they are confident in the future and think stock is really cheap) and the technical reaction to more demand and less supply. If the business has the momentum i think it does then this is a historical no-brainer. The effect of the Pref Stock/common stock bifurcation was to lever the Co up a bit more --which admittedly does have some risk--but if the revenues keep growing and HSN cost reduction integration is on target (mgt says yes) then this corporate finance strategy meaningfully enhances the upside of the common."
very big disappointment!!!
