"Been calculating the fundamentals of this company such as cash flow ratio, cash flow/share in addition to looking at their earnings and balance sheet and the same question keeps coming to my mind, why and how is the share of this company this cheap?"
Qurate Retail's (NASDAQ:QRTE.A) investors will be pleased with their decent 77% return over the last year 9/16Kind of a cheesy thing to say when it's down over 5 years
Wish we had a cash bump on stock!
Anybody alive on this board. I must be the only one intrested. Maybe I'm the only one making any money here. Oh well today's the day before earnings?
"Peter have you heard something I haven't. St one point owned 15000 shares. now down to 6000, Qrtea has not done anything for 8 monthsPurchased most of my shares between 6 and 7 so am doing rather well.A lot of hype no movement maybe it's time to move on????"
"So the consensus EBITDA estimates for QRTEA both 2020 and 2021 are $2,050 million. Subtract $375 mil for interest, $200 mil for CapX, $100 mil for taxes and now $100 mil for Pref Stock Divs and you get Equity Free Cash Flow of $1,275 million divide that by 415 mil shares and you get $3.07 per share in equity free cash flow per common share. At the current $7 stock price range, this means QRTEA is trading at 2.3X free cash flow!!! I challenge you to find a Co this size with a modest growth outlook trading anywhere near this equity free cash flow multiple.But the story gets better--the Co just paid a $633 mil special dividend--of which 41% was financed from the sale of a Green investment which no outside shareholder had any idea about--the equivalent of finding it in a drawer. So the quarter started with $948 mill in cash add the $262 mil and then subtract the $633 mil and you get $577 mil pro forma at June 30th. As shown above I expect the Co to generate of $1,275 over coming 4 quarters (actually i think the EBITDA will be higher based on Mgt commentary )If we assume they keep $577 mil around for liquidity purposes then that means they can use the $1,275 mil to buy back stock which I just showed you will generate a 44% return (if the stock doesnt move). If they try and buy back 44% of the stock, the stock will move higher- likely significantly higher- both from the signaling effect (they won't buy this much stock unless they are confident in the future and think stock is really cheap) and the technical reaction to more demand and less supply. If the business has the momentum i think it does then this is a historical no-brainer. The effect of the Pref Stock/common stock bifurcation was to lever the Co up a bit more --which admittedly does have some risk--but if the revenues keep growing and HSN cost reduction integration is on target (mgt says yes) then this corporate finance strategy meaningfully enhances the upside of the common."
"Francisco Parames bought this shares and if u see the fundamentals, P/FCF is very low, P/E is also low. At the end of the day what makes value for investor is the ability of the companie to make FCF. This is a machine of cash making."
"This is going up, P/E of 3 is a joke. The market fails to value correctly its communication bss. Whit a FCF per share of 3,50$. This has a fair price of 30 usd with a pesimistic view. 3.50FCF*10P/E=30-35 usd. They are buying back tons of shares and paying debt back."
The market usually values equities accurately. Can anyone explain how the current price is an accurate value for this company?
The industry had a very good run and many employees made millions as a result of strong performance. The Company has lost its' edge and the cause is not AMZN. I would say the company began losing their ability to perform at a high level in 2009 when many key employees who had built outstanding business units left the company. Cord cutting and complacent merchandising and marketing initiatives were replaced by a lack of know how and understanding of the successful model. I am a fan of combining HSN with QVC and Zulily . Maybe they will better understand the need to stabilize and grow new customer names. The model has two key models acquisition and retention of customer base. While broadcast sales are a center piece it is also the most difficult to grow on a new name basis doing more of the same. More innovation is required to drive business and further build the retention model. To the credit of management they have built some highly powerful businesses but without driving acquisition and retention with fresh strategies. They will continue to decline over the long term. Still a lot of potential and in my opinion more acquisition and better distribution are key to returning to a growth model again. At this price it is a hold. Do not however become complacent just because management is picking up some shares.

Everything else in his portfolio has run very high.So be patient. Between new subscribers and people looking to take profits elsewhere, I can see a lot of money coming here."
"QRTEA is a major Covid Work from home/stay at home play....yet the market hasn't figured it out yet!! On May 9th on the Q1 earnings call, the CEO basically said Sales across a wide variety of categories and customer engagement including growth in new customers was absolutely RIPPING since the beginning April--Here a few excerpts from this call:-Viewership up over 10%Social media views up over 100%Web traffic to Company websites was up over 30% and even higher among new customersSocial Reach up over 75%Outdoor products up 65% overall inc +70% in Germany and + 100% in the UKCulinary products up over 40%Pool Toys up 100%Bath and Beauty ""Up Strongly""Homemade Food up over 90%I hear from people who work there that the phone continues to ring off the hook and they are having a hard time answering callsSo what do the sleeping dunces on Wall St think?--they are predicting Flat (yes that's correct-FLAT) sales and declining earnings. How is that possible?....answer :they are not paying attention or listening to the Earnings call--frequently staffed on their behalf by very junior staff. This Co has struggled to grow sales since the HSN acquisition-- in fact they have been declining for a few years--well I think that has changed-- they have caught a major secular wind at their back for Covid and this breeze may blow for a several years. QRTEA is a differentiated retailer run by some very shrewd/successful investors in the legendary John Malone and former Microsoft CFO Greg Maffei--they have consistently repurchased stock over the years and will likely keep doing so as long as the market is giving the stock away. This stock--rerated as a modest growth stock ---should be 2-3x higher!"
One of the most undervalued stocks I've analyzed in a long time. Great Qtr!
Cmon this is getting old!
"Earnings are great and the news will come out after closing....I am buying all I can before the close today....BUY BUY now, or say bye bye to easy profits....remember me in your will."
Looks like MM deducted $4.50 dividend as an opening price?
"Tell me, maybe I missed something .. why they stopped paying dividends on Series A since December there have been no payments. The current is sent by R and very little.."
this is great let it go down more and let them buy back shares at these prices. this gives a much better return than dividend!!
