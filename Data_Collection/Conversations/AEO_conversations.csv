"I read anywhere between 15-18% short as of 30 Jul, so maybe we get lucky and become a ""meme""."
"Getting worse, knew it would never stay above $27, scam manipulated stock."
"Nordstrom takes a big hit, AEO looking strong before earnings."
its my fault....I'm so bullish on AEO I bought call options. That is why the price collapse.......the trading gods have it in for me.
"Burlington down $25 today, lost 46 million. There stores are empty, don’t know what’s going on new CEO from Ross."
AEO=youth is the unique powerful branding! Every single AEO trend goes viral on TikTok!
"Seems to happen a lot to stocks Cramer pumps heavily. It’s almost like he’s sending a signal to HF: “I’ll create the bag holders, you take’m out”. I don’t think it’s intentional but his AA certainly sets up a table for manipulation."
Hope $35 today reflecting GPS earnings despite FED. Just because $35.
"Down 5% today?? Any ideas why? Earnings aren't out till Sept 2nd and they have a bright near term future with back to school, child tax credit, etc"
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Haha, told you last year, this bum will never stay above $27 for any length of time. It always flops."
Huge lines outside AEO at city of commerce outlet mall.
"Cramers bargain stock is on clearance now. I think somebody shorted all his bargain stocks today? Hard to believe this one has come down again, great value at this level."
"following the footstep of Nordstrom and UO its looks like AEO also dropping but the lower it goes, further it will pop on 3rd Sep when it is going report the earning.Best time to buy (Nordstrom or UO report was not bad in fact its good not sure why everyone panicked)"
Wow. The bears really got their claws into this stock.
"People should not be selling just because HD was down big and talk of retail sales down, Walmart had blowout quarter. TJX will be big,Macy big and AEO even bigger."
"The Amazon guidance is definitely going to make investors pause while considering the strength of the consumer. However, IMHO, they will realize the Amazon loss is the brick and mortar gain."
"I finally sold my cannabis stocks got to aggravated and bought AEO, we will have to see."
"A gift at this price, $40 after earnings report"
I guess it’s nice to have a earnings miss already priced in :). Next Friday could be a lot of fun if they blow out earnings like we know they can!
"I posted a similar message on GPS...this stock is drifting off into space. When does it end? At this pace, the stock will hit zero 10-15 days. Makes no sense. Delta variant, the powers that be can't let a good crisis end. When does it end? We will be dealing with the virus or some form of it for many years to come and will likely never go away. Cramer has been pumping this stock for at least a month (and at much higher prices). Back to school is near and retail season has been incredible this summer. I think you have to be a buyer on days like today."
I bought my first 50 shares today at $31.30.
"Ortex just put in a ""Buy"" Trading Signal for AEO."
"AEO now rated a ""9"" on TD Ameritrade TipRanks. 10 is the highest score."
AEO stores are packed back to school don’t understand?
Awful.....thanks Cramer for recommending this #$%$ a month ago at $37. Can't take the beatings from the bears anymore. The 'sell' button is constantly running and there are no bulls around to put up a fight.
All strong retailers have reported strong #'s. Who cares what Nordstrom reported.

"Haha, headed back to 27 just like I said. This thing will never do anything long-term."
Does anyone know why AEO drops so much today?
If you watch the retail REITs you can get a good idea of how retailers are doing. If the likes of Tanger and Simon Properties say things are good then the retailers are doing good.
How many people take their kids to Nordstrom for back to school shopping. LOL! You cannot compare Nordstrom to AEO
"Jabberwonky saying he knew it wouldn't hold 27? He's been trashing it since before it hit $17.. give it a rest, go elsewhere, let go of your anger."
"Express came out today and reported a profit, it they could do it AEO will definitely pop."
"Jabberwonky, if it does go to $27.. that's still more than $10 higher than when you were trashing it to go lower. What makes you so confident now, the broken clock theory?"
The more down it goes the more upside it has after the earning or close to the earning. This stock fall not fault of its own but by looking at some other retailers and figures it will follow this pattern. This is best time to buy this. It will double the price within a year.
Urban and ANF reported and stock dropped… doesn’t look good for AEO when earnings is out
"Here is text from Ortex ""Buy"" signal issued today for AEO: ""An EPS (Type 2) buy signal has been triggered which shows that, over the last 6 years, whenever American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. has entered EPS (Type 2) Buy, the stock has gone up by an average of 3.76% over the 4 trading days following the signal. This signal has triggered 15 times over this period and has been successful 80% of the time."""
This will pop after earnings. I wonder if it will get the full effect though with how weak it has performed recently.
Buy < $31 again?
