Was in a AEO-Aerie store (8/8/20) and it was crowded. That’s just one store. Was a lot of back to school shopping going on. My Daughter and Wife shopped in there for about 45 mins. They had a line waiting to get in. I saw only two people that left before they could get in the store. The store was well stocked with inventory and they were handing water out to the people who were waiting to get in. There were a lot of shoppers walking around the outlet with bags from Aerie’s. Hopefully this is a good sign for the quarter. The other “J”.
I think we might hang out around 17 for a while before another bump. Will be interesting to watch.
It was the most wonderful AEO experience. Best regards to AEO longs and I may join you again in future. Good luck with your trading.
"Soft guidance, plus regular market reaction to dump retail stocks after earnings. Kind of predictable. A buying opportunity now."
Earnings are before market opens or after market close today?
Does AEO have risks with increased tariffs if no deal is made with China?If Trump increases tariffs to 25% will that be a significant hit to earnings ?
"AEO is GREEN when the MARKET is RED, turn around in play with the Upgrade today."
Concerned…. Downside reversal on monster volume. Any thoughts out there?
"Opened up a new position before earnings, looked at their brands & balance sheet and only saw good things, feeling positive regardless of what the stock does tomorrow. I don't quite understand where the ''retail is dead'' narrative came from, the US consumer is strong and clothing retailers will always have a place in the economy. The only condition is that the company is executing which AEO definitely is."
"Lots of people buying, increasing share percentage big time."
"Meanwhile a stock that is very dependent on China for revenues and supply chain is performing quite well, actually two of them, Apple and Tesla. Markets are rigged, everyone is already aware that mortality rate outside of China where everyone has compromised immune systems is practical nil."
Looks like a good buy opportunity here. I don’t see why there was such a large sell off today
It’s 8/20/20. Daughter got her jeans today in the mail from the In store Return. Guess what she’s happy with the fit. Hope this is the feeling of other shoppers of AEO. If so than the numbers will hopefully be good. “The other J “.
AEO reached a new 52 Week High at 20.24
best bargain in retail
Good pump n dump before the earnings call. I'll wait this hoax out until it's back to being realistic between $14.50 - $14.75 tops. A 0.14 dividend to lose $1.50 a share minimum in the next 2-3 weeks? Not me.
"Pretty much buying back in at what I sold it yesterday but don't see it dropping much more today, any way, tomorrow, the numbers will be good and Wall Street will use the rate cuts as a good thing as opposed to a bad thing, think this could be 14 or higher after report."
I added down when -6.5%....
The more down it goes the more upside it has after the earning or close to the earning. This stock fall not fault of its own but by looking at some other retailers and figures it will follow this pattern. This is best time to buy this. It will double the price within a year.
almost 1.2 million volume moved so far before market. Just based on it hitting top 10 active under the NYSE it should be a stock plenty of active people take a peek at today.
"Looks like we had a short-covering rally in AEO this morning. Short interest in AEO was very high. Spiked up & now fading. Q1 results were bad, but they seem to be better positioned for a future recovery, good cash reserves."
8% growth in sales is good . Forward p/e of 11.6 is below s&p500 of about 16 . A 3% Dividend is more than the s&p500 dividend by about 0.3% .Overall picture for AEO is close to excellent for the long run at the current price of $19 .Do not forget it traded at $28 three months ago. It is my Personel opinion only folks .Good luck everybody analyzing and reaping .
"AEO, GPS, CPRI, TPR will be rallying back tmr!"
If the kitchen is to hot. The best move is to get out of the kitchen. It’s going to be a long bumpy ride back to the top. With the rise of COVID-19. This is the reality. Deal with it or close your position. Crying about it is not going to make this stock go in the direction you want it to go in. These are the circumstances no one has control over. The hard reality. The other J.
"Thanks Europe and Asia. Let's panic, lock the world down again....."
"Key points from the conference call, explaining why the stock is going up and why the company is a good investment:“Store closures and aggressive inventory liquidation had a significant impact on our first quarter financials,” American Eagle CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a statement.“Yet customer engagement remained high and digital demand accelerated, well-exceeding our expectations. Aerie’s performance was truly exceptional despite store closures.”Digital revenue rose 9% in the latest quarter. And while the American Eagle brand’s revenue decreased 45%, following a 5% increase last year, Aerie’s revenue decreased only 2%, following a 28% increase last year.""This is just the beginning, by the end of the year the stock will be back at all-time highs. Ignore the noise and ignore the shorts."
Green after call. Panic sell off. There's no unexpected losses here.
"No reason for the hit today nothing was changed, still the same guidance."
"Comps way up and earnings improved from last year, but still taking a beating today. Good buying opportunity."
short interest over 14%
I'm an investor and frequent shopper of this company. Does anybody else find their app clever AF? You unlock promotions by leveling up? You gain EXP by spending. It feels fun even though I am 36 haha
"All positive news today, moves from hold to buy and it goes down almost 2.5%, hahaha. This was worst performing day this stock has had in 3 months, haha. This pullback might be yet another buying opportunity."
I cannot believe this low price. Note gone from 0% debt to much more in one week due to raking out a line of credit. What do you all think of this?
American Eagle Outfitters reached a 52 Week high at 20.55
its my fault....I'm so bullish on AEO I bought call options. That is why the price collapse.......the trading gods have it in for me.
"Another nice move up today, over 2%. It truly brings out the creeps and cyber stalkers."
Nice run today.Loving the volatility here .
Stock performance is not encouraging... But the company is great
"There it goes, flopping up again J!"
Brooke Shields!
Trending down prior to earnings. Sell now or wait for earnings? I'm worried about a big drop if the earnings are anything short of spectacular.
"AEO has beaten in the past six quarters but market was no kind to them. Based on lower expectations for Q3 and the optimistic outlook from last earnings call, we may be a nice surprise. It may start to turn the corner. Bought some at the close."
Depending on overall market tomorrow.Actually retailers and fashion houses tend to be contrarian to the markets. With huge run up today profit taking tomorrow so it could actually be a good day.
"following the footstep of Nordstrom and UO its looks like AEO also dropping but the lower it goes, further it will pop on 3rd Sep when it is going report the earning.Best time to buy (Nordstrom or UO report was not bad in fact its good not sure why everyone panicked)"
Impressive ascent. I'm out after doubling my money. No longer a value imo. Now a growth play.
"Beyond earnings, this stock is starting to look like a ""dividend stock""...except the company never increases its dividend."
"Wow, getting creamed today. Retail scare I guess."
"When does AEO report, ANF came out with good results. now AEO turn."
"Wooooo, I'm enjoying all of this negative sentiment. Nevermind the consumer is strong; TGT just brought out some weak numbers. It's doomsday all over again. Malls will be closing any day now. AMZN is going to put everyone out of business. Even Five Below, the great store with no exposure to China is doing bad....really, this is fun stuff right here."
AEO going to pay the $.1375 deferred dividend from the spring. Payable on 12/30/2020 to stockholders of record on 12/16/2020. Dec 30 2020. Looks like ex-div date will be 12/15/2020.
Hope $35 today reflecting GPS earnings despite FED. Just because $35.
"AEO reported a loss of $0.03, consensus was ($0.14), Earnings Whisper was ($0.11)"
"I was out of town this weekend, went to a local mall and the Aerie store was running over with people. AEO looked good but Aerie looked like they were giving away free money...."
This is all my kids want for close and the whole middle school. I know nothing about the company how is their fiscal standings.
Price Positive + High Volume = BullishPrice Negative + Low Volume = Bullish --> Today 06/12/2019Price Positive + Low Volume = BearishPrice Negative + High Volume = Bearish
"AEO was doing fine before the virus and had a strong balance sheet. They say they have enough cash to ride out closures through Feb 2021 and beyond. This is good news, but AEO stock drops 20%. Makes no sense. Sure, discretionary retail is hurting. However, Amer Eagle is the best house in a bad neighborhood. When there's good news (and there will be) AEO will fly."
"Come on boys and girls with Morgan Stanley and B of A come out with your new calls, seems to be the only thing markets respond to now, either upgrade or downgrade so this thing will move off of the status quo."
ez 16 tomorrow
AEO stores are packed back to school don’t understand?
"Jabberwonky saying he knew it wouldn't hold 27? He's been trashing it since before it hit $17.. give it a rest, go elsewhere, let go of your anger."
"American outfitters has a nice quarter But warnings of a slow start to 2019, didn’t notice Abercrombie stating what It will be doing the first of the year and their stock flys, Why not just report the fourth-quarter earnings and that’s it like Abercrombie did"
Any insights explaining a 5% drop today on no news (that I could find)?
"Also, I’m filling up on the dip. I already bought some shares this morning and trying to get some Mo"

"Don't get too excited yet. Revenues were good. Aerie looked good as usual and I'm glad they are concentrating on opening stand-alone Aerie stores (over 20 of these forecasted to open in 2020). However, AE line continues to slow, comp is slowing. They better do something about the shirts, logos look bad and people continue to complain; that's why the tops sales are poor. They are retaining more earnings and rewarding shareholders less while the share price tanks to 12 bucks, can't say I'm happy about that either....but oh well."
SHORTIES will be squeezed $AEO same as $GME $AMC
"AEO is a company that trades at only 12 times forward earnings, has 16 consecutive quarters of positive comps, embraces the technology aspect of retail, and is a potential take out candidate. I'm in AEO long as of today for the first time. It's very rare to find a gem like this. Disregard the trade minutia and follow the money. The chart looks good too, esp. the long term monthly chart."
AEO & SLCA oversold(at least SLCA is recovering from $8.85 level)
"Apparent traces of boiler room(s) can be recognized on this message board. In the meantime, share price recovers. Not the worst situation."
Nice green day.Maybe $8s on the way.Good luck longs.
"Of course this happened, I expected nothing else. At this point, the majority of this China fiasco should be priced in. I look forward to earnings, regardless of what it does to the ""price.""...I thought it was this month but looks like first week of September. All I can say is hold strong until then."
This will pop after earnings. I wonder if it will get the full effect though with how weak it has performed recently.
Yesterday was just one of those great days where you trust your gut and end up with a perfect set of trades. Sold off my Kohl’s after decent short term gain and sold big profitable gain in Boyd Gaming. Put all the proceeds into AEO at $16.40 and $16.45. Up over three grand instead of being down $400.
"Earning report came on weaker side and every retailer stock is under magnifying glass, because of tariffs. It means that every sign of weakness causes big market overreaction, aka selloff, and it makes buying after shock reasonable.This company is still very profitable and balance sheet is healthy. Also, US consumer spending is strong, because Americans have jobs and personal incomes grow."
American Eagle Outfitters is down 5.62% to 29.97
Big moves 2day. S&P flirted yesterday with new highs but failed but hopefully this wk.
"Interesting, beat top and bottom, missed comps by 1%, still up 2% though. Could be PM games. Think it will end green. Good market shaping up today, which should help."
This is a great company!
Raymond James just raised AEO to Outperform with $10 price target.
Nice positive day for AEO today. I guess we won't be getting a post from @J. Good ole reverse flop.
"Meanwhile Morgan Stanley who claims that the semi-conductor sector is in the midst of a major inventory correction cycle, the economy is on the verge of a recession and now they have gone from being very bearish to being bullish on AMD. You are correct, the analysts who are in the pockets of the uber wealthy are again pumping select companies in the technology sector meanwhile attacking the retail sector. As the vast majority of the country's wealth resides in the uber wealthy 0.1% and the vast majority of them tend to be liberal, it is really no surprise that they would attack the retail and fashion sectors just as they did in October to create market chaos, that led to worst December performance in the history of the stock market. They drove prices down until Christmas Eve to help cause turmoil in the retail sector, even with a strong economy it is sometimes very difficult for people to buy gifts when their IRA lost twenty percent of its value in a month. They know what they are doing and what they are doing is trying to cause a recession and retail and freight sectors are key elements."
American Eagle Outfitters is down 5.41% to 31.99
"on earnings beat when no one buys , they pump prior to release like 20% but when you buy in to beat the odds,they scam you."
"J, the two S stocks taught me not to be greedy, your SIX and my SIG, fortunately sold SIX after a very tiny gain right before it tanked, and then tanked again, do you think that stock ever rebounds? Thankfully, made some decent money on Signet after they pre-announced and dumped in the low 30 mark, then they tanked the tar out of it too, bought back into it around 22.50, never touched Six Flags again, probably won't for the near future. Good hunting, it is scary out there though."
"So with Dec 5th, being declared a market holiday in observance of G.W. Bush, are they still going to be reporting on the 5th, and if so what are we to expect on the 6th."
AEO bottomed yesterday. I told folks to buy the dip in AEO. the time to own is now. it is surging. and alot of good articles are written about how it is strongest of the breed or bunch.
"Yep, I told you so yesterday. Stevie Wonder could have seen it coming. Same story, different day. Beats earnings and gives poor guidance, been here before. Basically same reaction, down around 15%."
"MAY 3RD AEO was 24.12 I am buying this discount drop at 20.55 just 10 days later, over sold. buy the bargain."
"Too risky to trade today. Who ever is doing the selling is obviously using this very mild news to unload ownership. All retail will have this for the next month, minimizing economic risk. Doesn't reflex the long term outcome in anyway."
"J - I am waiting for your apology when yesterday you asked if I ""get out much"" with my prediction of soft sales. DO YOU GET OUT MUCH? Easy to see AE was in trouble with elevated inventory levels and aggressive markdowns. Maybe investing in retail is new to you..."
Over 3% dividend now with capital appreciation potential. Going back up.
22.00 price target now
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
The near term stock price target is now defined by the private price offering.
"Come on guys. Buying opportunity. Look at the net debt of 0 versus ambercrombie and even gap and Levi, no comparison ! This is your best bet in apparel and women’s wear. Know your numbers!"
Took a big position this morning. Excellent entry level. Little downside risk and a very well run company. GLTAL’s
DOW JONES is up 333 pts and AEO is going to rebound. buy the dip.
this will be up tomorrow
"I guess if you stand on your head and look at the stock chart... it's flopped...??Earnings day next Tuesday, 17 days earlier than last year! This is no guarantee but I think they have news they REALLY want to talk about. if aerie continues to deliver solid results, it should be worth at least as much as the value of the whole company. And they don't have a huge debt hole, the balance sheet is net cash!"
If you watch the retail REITs you can get a good idea of how retailers are doing. If the likes of Tanger and Simon Properties say things are good then the retailers are doing good.
"Should be an interesting week of analysts downgrades on the sector to try and dispel any positive traction that retail could be gaining with many of the retailers reaffirming guidance, AEO, ANF and M all pretty much said they did what they said they would. I am certain that Credit Suisse will have to come out with major downgrades to distract from their horrible call on the Christmas shopping season, they said it would be a disaster. Numbers that are coming out are showing that to be a very wrong call, yet again."
LOW VOLUME + STOCK FALL = BULLISH
"Looks like good numbers, in-line on earnings, a very slight beat on revs, and any beat is a good one and same store sales 1.6% above consensus. Unless guidance is weak and I would highly doubt that, I don't see this going down much, it should be up by all rights."
"The stock is up because the market makers know that Jay along with private equity backing will be taking it private soon, the same with DSW. May try and take over other strugglers to include ANF."
Heading back to highs
I guess 16 wasn't new price level after all.
"When, not if, Trump pivots on the tariffs, does this stock go up? I think that’s most of the reason for the sell off"
"AEO - good positive earnings consistently. Undervalued IMO. No debt. A solid buy at such a low price. sell off if it goes high, hold on for awhile if it doesnt fly ;)"

"Nordstrom takes a big hit, AEO looking strong before earnings."
This will drop below $19 tomorrow. Earnings are irrelevant with weak guidance. Prepare for a double digit decline.
This morning Wedbush analyst raises price target on AEO from $10 to $12. Maintains outperform rating.
"Cramers bargain stock is on clearance now. I think somebody shorted all his bargain stocks today? Hard to believe this one has come down again, great value at this level."
What happen to the earnings report ? is this market all fake ?
17 coming very soon.
"I'm waiting for the proof in the pudding ie earnings reports coming out better than expected and continued strong growth at aerie, approaching $1bn in revs they have lots of runway and that alone should value aerie above what the whole company is being valued."
That’s it for me folks. Just sold all my 2000 shares @16.90 today. Good luck for all of you! With Trump and his tweets and tariffs AEO will have a hard time.
"AEO provided some blowout expectations for 1Q, Revs>1bn (estimates 904m, up mid-teens vs pre-covid) and adjusted Operating Income approx 120m vs 49m 2 years ago."
"bubble going to pop - head of sales dumped half his AEO sharesAndrew J. Mclean, American Eagle Outfitters's EVP & Chief Commercial Officer, recently disposed of 18,115 shares of the company. The disposals took place at $14.50 per share, on September 14, 2020. Mclean still owns 18,115 shares of the company. Mclean operates out of New York, NY.

"AEO now rated a ""9"" on TD Ameritrade TipRanks. 10 is the highest score."
Deal of a lifetime right here. I had no plans to buy more but at this rate I will.
I was gonna sell this when it dipped to 16 for a small loss and get my money into something better but didn't now I regret that
"I am jealous of all of you that are buying, I ran out of buying funds last week. The powder has to be refilled!"
"Was happy to see the pullback last week as it gave me a nice entry price. Will likely add more tomorrow. I’m curious though if any of you had insight into why there is such high short position in AEO. I just can’t see the negative as they have a strong balance sheet, low PE and peg and growing earnings. What’s your guess on their thought process?"
"Getting worse, knew it would never stay above $27, scam manipulated stock."
As a long time share holder I would advise not to buy this before earnings. Even if it beats great look at what it has done historically and what retail has been doing lately. Only buy for longer-term. I'd hate for you to get burned bad. I'm positive AEO but not when it comes to earnings reactions.
Not sure why yahoo has no news about the new cosmetic line they are launching for the holidays
Putting a toe in the water. Haven’t looked at AE in years and it kept showing up in search engines as I did (the majority of) Christmas shopping online this year. Every item I was looking at was already sold out (two weeks ago). Is that a good sign?
"Why do I feel like this is a trap, something a con would pull.....smash it down, quick bump. Waiting on a decline any minute. Hope I'm wrong but..."
"Lululemon is starting to look like an excellent short.Few reasons:1. Expensive valuation. Market Cap is more than the COMBINED value of $GPS $HBI $AEO EV/Sales > 62. limited growth prospects especially if they don't lower prices. Also seem like a Longshot for them to successfully launch in other product like shoes.3. At risk of becoming too 'cool and rich' for a public backlash it happen before think A&F, Victoria Secrets.4. Increasimg competition in the yoga space. Big brands like Nike are just now getting more serious about stealing lulu's customer. 5. Brands like ATHLETA are successfully growing as they concentrate marketing to all woman. They use models of all sizes, Lululemon uses just female models that under idk under 115lbs maybe, check Instagram. Isn't this the reason Victoria Secret is getting public shame over?6. International Growth won't be enough to keep premium valuation with any weakness domestically (North America).Go ahead please tell me I'm wrong, I don't follow Lulu very close but if it goes to $200 before $100 I'll be having a closer look."
"On TD Ameritrade, TipRanks still rates AEO a very ""outperform"" level ""9"" on a scale of 1 to 10."
"David, in a traditional market I would agree, in today's markets where the same block of 10K shares could be traded back and forth one hundred times in a trading day, volume isn't the indicator that it used to be. Two brokerage houses trying to drive the price up/down for the day could do that with HFT with the same block of shares, selling back and forth to each other. I am hopeful with the massive computing power that comes with HFT that eventually the SEC will demand that the markets create a churn rate for stocks as well, meaning that there be two or even three separate volume numbers monitored, one that includes all shares, just like we now have, and one that only shows the number of unique shares that trade in a single trading session, it takes out the day traders and the manipulators. So if there are 2 million total shares traded and the number of unique shares traded is only 2 hundred thousand, we can assume that each share was traded on average ten times, it actually gives you a completely different insight to what is happening to a particular stock. Though I doubt it will ever happen, it would show the spotlight on what is really happening in our markets and even the SEC really doesn't want that to be known."
"Richard, not a huge fan of their designs, but their management team is top notch, they run one of the tightest ships in retail in my opinion. The company's issues are tied more to the overall false narratives about brick and mortar retailers and even more so the future of Malls, both of which I think are doing well, than issues that are unique to AEO. And that is coming from someone who does not have a position, either way."
GAP smashed earnings and pops after hours. This is oversold.
Does anyone know why AEO drops so much today?

"By March of 2010, during the Obama administration, approximately 56 million Americans had been infected by the H1N1 (swine flu) virus. 12,000 Americans died because of it. At the time that Americans started to understand the magnitude of the virus in America, the Dow was trading at 10,325 (Feb. 1, 2010). At the peak of the virus, on March 15, 2010, the Dow had climbed to 10,741, the market did eventually dip to 10,211 on June 7th due to weak economic numbers associated with the virus. The Dow by the end of 2010 was trading at 11,674. Can anyone say that the uber wealthy (most of whom are liberal) and the news media (all of which are liberal with a few rare exceptions) have successfully politicized the Corona virus."
AEO recommended by Stifel---projected price target $50 in 2021.
"AEO will come back rocking, buy on the dip... should be better than EXPR which soared after earning."
Look at it go today.
"Back to 16 it goes, just like that. Really, who would have sold on an earnings/revenue beat with a slightly weak forecast? Aerie comp was up 16%, smh."
Looks like it wants a full recovery in a few days like the many other huge earnings drops that followed with slow rises.
"Which retail stock will double first? AEO to $17 or KSS to $34? Shaggy, what do you think?"
90-minute RSI for AEO has now crossed above 30 .
AEO just doesn’t have what it takes to give you the gains you’re hoping for. If you’re going to invest in retail stocks ANF is the one. AEO has an outdated business plan which barely keeps it afloat. I suggest ANF I’ve been getting nice gains from it....it will easy go past $25+ once they release earnings especially. Them bringing back gilly hicks is what’s going to cause massive earnings. Do your DD and I’m sure you’ll come to the same conclusion.
"Where are you getting 6% growth? I'm seeing basically flat EPS growth. I'm a big fan of AEO (obviously) but earnings seemed to have slowed, I'd say that is concerning. Dividend is good but they don't increase it, it's flat too. Unlike some companies I can see what problems are, I'm really not sure here. Aerie seems to be growing like a weed, jeans, there really is only so much further it can go in US. The growth will come internationally. I remain confident in AEO's ability to navigate mall scare. It's retail spaces are really not that big, they have lots of online sales and I just don't think it's as big of an issue for them as some bigger stores."
I bought some on Friday at $19.10. A little Skittish on retail but I did a lot of DD and fell that aeo May be a good pick ? And it offers a dividend. Glad to be in this forum with all other AEo holders. Good luck to us !
wont be down more than 2% tomorrow
"Not sure about revs, but beat profits by a good margin."
"If the big money who controls the overall markets were REALLY worried about the Covid virus, Clorox wouldn't be down and Amazon wouldn't be up. Just taking headlines to create false narratives to drive prices down on consumer discretionary stocks to buy cheap shares leading into retails big Christmas season with nearly 13 trillion dollars of excess savings sitting in American consumers' bank accounts."
Zachs downgraded and two days later upgraded. Wth is wrong with them??? No fundamentals have changed.
AEO in for a big day on 9/4 based on what I see from the Tillys and Guess earnings reports just released. The mall retail apocalypse is so overplayed right now
"Posted an hour ago on Yahoo: Is a Surprise Coming for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) This Earnings Season? ""Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report....In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AEO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.66% heading into earnings season."""
Why is AEO so cheap? Strong balance sheet. Second favorite brand among teens (Nike 1st). Consistently profitable. Good/safe dividend. One of the few retailers that is growing and succeeding in stores and online. Gaining market share. Huge stock buyback. AEO should be $25 and/or a takeover target.
$AEO ALL PUTS in RED and I warned all the SHORTS yesterday to BAIL or else suffer today. AEO is booming its one of the best and its digital space aka ONLINE shopping is booming and AEO is growing overseas on top AERIE is #1 and its destroying Limited Brands and Victoria Secrets hands down.

Was it a beat or a miss??
Tough time to retail but a good time to invest into.
"Market is obsessed with tariffs, when it comes to retail stocks. It is a myopic reaction, actually, because retail stock business depends on China less than many manufacturing stocks, for example. Clothes can be made in many countries and production can be relocated quickly. Also, retailers hardly own any assets in China. On the contrary, many ""us manufacturing"" companies actually own assets and produce stuff in China and relocating manufacturing line to another country is more complicated issue than making socks or shirts in Vietnam."
"Don't give up. This will end today higher > @17,32 to @17,44"
the earnings were great and although guidance was just ok. the company is growing and the valuation is cheap. Aerie will continue to grow and they will be just fine.
I noticed there was 20% short interest here. And yesterday there was a hit piece downgrade. That’s why we’re down today. Classic short manipulation.
"Horrible earnings? It beat earnings. Pessimistic outlook? Did you even listen to the call? BOW deleveraging will likely not continue past Q1. Did all the global expansion and opening of 60 Aerie stores sound pessimistic? HA, invest in a hearing aid instead of stocks. The only people worried are people that thought they'd jump in at the last minute and make a quick buck, long-term it looks great."
"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Reaffirms Fourth Quarter EPS Guidance of 34 to 36 cents Quarter-To-Date Comp Sales Approximately Flat......smh"
AE is a loved company with great foreseeable future. I think we will see analysts reiteration thumps up.
More to buy
"Omg, hilarious. I said it was going back to 16 but didn't know it would be that fast. To those that bought yesterday, consider yourselves lucky ;)"
Down more than 7% 
"People should not be selling just because HD was down big and talk of retail sales down, Walmart had blowout quarter. TJX will be big,Macy big and AEO even bigger."
Clearly that was a cap sell
I said this awhile back this is a very slow moving stock. It take years for this stock to above $19. It has more Down days than up. Been dealing with this stock since 2012. It just not a big mover on the up. But it sure has no problem going south. That is just a fact. Research it for yourself. Just my experience with this stock. Don’t get me wrong it’s a solid company but Wall Street don’t seem to have must respect for it. My opinion. The other J.
"Jaz, unfortunately unless the analysts can put a seriously negative spin to the news, this is not the buying opportunity that you had hoped for, though I was secretly hoping for a big drop to pick up a position as well."
Anyone know why it is down almost 3% today? My kids love AEO and ANF clothing.
AEO is up 80 cents up 6% today. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING
Buying the dip- teens want AEO and parents buy it!
"Burlington down $25 today, lost 46 million. There stores are empty, don’t know what’s going on new CEO from Ross."
"there was no disaster...tax cuts been around a while there, next talking point"
AEO upgraded to overweight from neutral by JP Morgan this morning.
Any thoughts on price target for the year?
Urban and ANF reported and stock dropped… doesn’t look good for AEO when earnings is out
"I finally sold my cannabis stocks got to aggravated and bought AEO, we will have to see."
"No, No, No. Although today we do not finish above $ 17.00. Today was an excellent day because I finally saw purchases, many purchases and came to see sales and more sales. Today the graph was not all red in the volumes. I said I am losing a lot of money and I was the first to recognize that I fell into a trap. But today the volumes were full of green bars. If the SP500 had not come down today we could have been close to $ 18.00. There are a couple of difficult days but if AEO does not fall then it will explode at last. Because AEO is like ROKU. Without debt, excellent profits, a portion of tariffs from China, since it manufactures in Mexico, Vietnam and India. Late or Early will explode. The manipulation of a share is not always possible, example today. All those green bars today are already facing the manipulators."
"Current market cap is just over 4n, aerie's revenues are estimated to double to 2bn by FY23 (high growth). EV/S for Comps like UA (bag of turd) is 2X, COLM 2X, LULU 8X (great company but aerie is growing faster). Aerie should be worth at least what AEO's current market cap is worth. And AE is not worth negative, it's recovering and profitable."
"While just about every other company is suspending dividends, AEO just declared their quarterly div of $.1375 (that's ~7% at today's pps). More importantly, this shows AEO is confident in their business future and liquidity."
Either way you look at it the $16.25's to $16.75 will walk across the ticker tomorrow . Options don't lie
BOOM! AEO SURGING ON GREAT EARNINGS REPORT JUST LIKE ANF.
"1 big cluster (6.6k) of $23 calls expires Jan 29th.. the next big cluster (19k) is also $23 calls exiting Feb 19th. These sharks will short the stock to try and defend their calls and if you look at daily short volumes, that's what's happening (daily short volumes are high). They take the fat premiums, short the stock to keep it out of the money, buy stock after worthless expiration, ride it up, sell, write more calls, wash, rinse, repeat. And this allows them to amass a larger position on ""free"" call premiums. Writing calls and getting lucky is one thing, writing calls and shorting the stock is another and it's manipulative."
Aggressive into earnings...will it pop up or drop?
Checking out. Reducing my holdings. Better options. Keeping 3000 but selling the rest. Good luck Longs. The other “J”.
Cannabis play. This stock is set to pop.
"GAP's presentation shows a glimpse of the opportunity at AEO. GAP thinks Athleta will double from $1bn to $2bn by 2023, Athleta grew 8% last quarter which in this environment is fine.. aerie grew 32% last quarter! aerie's value is being completely ignored. GAP's plan has significant store reduction by 2023, AEO has a similar opportunity. This move will cost them over $200m, we'll see what path AEO takes but AEO has a better balance sheet today (net cash vs net debt at GPS). I'm still waiting to see the results for this quarter, I'd expect AEO's to be better than GPS's."
"Positive article in Barron's (can be googled) ""3 Stock Picks From a Standout Mid-Cap Value Fund""."
Back to school is coming an quite a few parents are getting an extra child credit check of $300-$500 each month till December. How much of that cash can AEO get? My guess is a lot
"Hi, Shaggy. I do not understand your point of view. How can you compare AEO with ANF? AEO has high growth potential. It has no tariffs since it manufactures in Vietnam, Mexico, India and a little in China. It has no debts. It has a high cash flow. AEO increase 30% online sells, don’t need to be in a mall. It will open more than 70 stores while ANF will close stores. It has 18 quarters growing up and its Aerie brand is barely heating the engines to take off like a rocket. After our conversation, I read a lot about manipulation and my conclusion is the following if AEO reached a minimum of $ 16.31 you should calmly raise it to $ 6.00 and its minimum price would be $ 22.31. Now if the FED cut the rates in June then we will see a new 52wl, but if the Fed waits and only says that in case of an economic deterioration it will cut the rates = AEO returns to at least $ 24.00.I wish you the best to all."
"Down 5% today?? Any ideas why? Earnings aren't out till Sept 2nd and they have a bright near term future with back to school, child tax credit, etc"
"4Q update looks fantastic, adjusted operating income +23% y/y while EPS estimates are -19%FY23 targets also look compelling, AE recovers from current levels to ""2019"" levels which is a recovery of about 30% from current levels.. and doubling of Aerie. And significant improvement in profitability, driving 10% OMs, 550m of operating income compared to 318m in FY20 (Feb 2020 year end which they refer to as 2019). That's adjusted operating income 75% higher than FY20 when they delivered EPS of 1.48 putting $2.60 of EPS power in the sights."
Would this be an entry point for a short term gain... is this oversold today?
"Ortex just put in a ""Buy"" Trading Signal for AEO."
"https://www.aeo-inc.com/2021/03/03/american-eagle-outfitters-reports-fourth-quarter-results/Aerie revenue up 25%, comp sales up 29%Digital revenue increased 35%, with Aerie up 75% and AE up 20%Gross margin expanded 300 basis points, due to higher full-priced sales and reduced promotionsStrong liquidity — reinstating quarterly cash dividend at $0.1375 per share"
Huge lines outside AEO at city of commerce outlet mall.
"Something is up!!American Eagle is up substantially in after hours trading, big volume as well.Anyone know anything? Speculation?"
Added more shares today. Didn't think I'd get this opportunity anytime soon.

So let's forecast. What do you see happening tomorrow? I think it goes back up 2%.
Many analysts upgrading their AEO price targets this morning. Most are in the $14 - $16 range. Did not see any actual downgrades. AEO is up over 25% in 3 weeks. Wouldn't be surprised to see a bit of profit taking here.
Barclays upgrades AEO to overweight with price target $18.
"Prediction-decent to good earnings but the stock goes down, as always after earnings. Buy the dip and ride the next day or two back up....I’m a long but I may pull a swing trade for fun, same story, different day...."
AEO just needs an upgrade. Once an analyst receives money from a shareholder will upgrade and this goes up
I feel like maybe people will start realizing that American Eagle is less of a mall stock and that it’s more of a company that is slowly transforming Into a strong online brand￼. It reminds me more of a UNIQLO than of a GAP￼
"They bought hand over fist cheap, now it rises."
"We got a nice lift from the LEVI positive earnings and CC. Jeans are big, and I believe we're going to get good traction over the next few months/back to school."
Buy < $31 again?
2018 Annual report state no short or Long term debt while yahoo showing debt of 1.6. billion. Anyone can clarify ? I'm analysing to enter at this price
"J, so you are keeping your position going into earnings? Thought about buying into it, but it seems the big money still is insisting on keeping retail and fashion in their current market doldrums, the numbers from Macy's really did not get the respect that they should have and originally did get at the pre-market and the early open. I just fear that anything short of a huge beat on top and bottom with amazing guidance will lead to a buck drop, the up side could be big, but just too much risk for the potential reward. Good luck."
One of Wall Streets best buys...
Why is this melting away when they are about to blow the lid off back to school and possibly spin off Aerie?
"Anyone know their debt situation? I see many articles saying they have no debt but Yahoo Finance shows they have $1.6B in debt and the latest earnings statement shows a ""Non-current operating lease liabilities"" of about $1.3B which wasn't there last year. Do they have any debt or not?"
"Target, Five Below, Children's Place and Kohl's all posted less than stellar numbers, appears that the darlings of Wall Street failed the analysts, it is about time that they share the love with the mall dwellers such as Macy's, Dillard's, American Eagle, and Abercrombie who all did pretty well this holiday season. Of course they have to close out their short positions on them before they start to change their opinions and price targets."
"Haha, told you last year, this bum will never stay above $27 for any length of time. It always flops."
"Dear AEO, you are expanding, earnings looking good, everything is looking good; therefore, we shall make your price drop....hahah."
Another 52 week high today
When will people learn that all this taper talk is just talk….Powell has been very consistent
Congrats longs!Been a nice ride past few months with AEO.Been flopping up for quite a while.
AEO=youth is the unique powerful branding! Every single AEO trend goes viral on TikTok!
July 12 options are holding AEO today. All retail in genera up by more than 2% today.
"This has just turned into a BUM stock completely. It's more hated than Macy's now, hilarious, never thought I'd see that."
I bought my first 50 shares today at $31.30.
I love AEO but I don't think it will hold...
Thanks for the ride. I'm out now.
Awful.....thanks Cramer for recommending this #$%$ a month ago at $37. Can't take the beatings from the bears anymore. The 'sell' button is constantly running and there are no bulls around to put up a fight.
Good management but like all retail in the same boat. Buy here. Could be in double numbers in the Future .
"AEO numbers compared to others in the retail industry, look very strong and shares should be a lot higher, it is the expectation that the analysts or company keep raising! I wouldn’t be surprised to see 21-22 short tern"
"Conflicting analyst calls this morning, though they all maintain previous ratings:1. Citigroup: Buy, Price Target $202. Cowen: Outperform, Price Target $253. Morgan Stanley: Underweight, Price Target $14See them on marketwatch.upgrades"
AEO is teens’ favorite love!endless innovations!
"If ANF has a day like that , then AEO should do really well. They have a stronger brand to begin with, they have a good online presence, and AERIE is growing rapidly.! This company should take off"
"I think AEO fared best in teen/youth fast fashions and Aerie outpaced Victoria Secret. Its athletic wear is well received too and is on par with trends. People in Reddit , men and women, recently found their taste with AE jeans ; those who flocked away to other brands recently returned to AE jeans(look reviews in Reddit).After being frustrated to find perfect size for my 5'9 and zero size daughter, I got reasonable price at AE. It has all kinds of sizes, stores are small and well organized , Jeans are custom made and some stores have customs prints (for graphic tees)made in store. While Gap closed stores permanently during pandemic, AEO expanded its footprint throughout. I heard that shoe collection is good too. I got this at below 10 and I think it has potential to grow well into the future."
"The Amazon guidance is definitely going to make investors pause while considering the strength of the consumer. However, IMHO, they will realize the Amazon loss is the brick and mortar gain."
"Look at GAP today, when this thing beats earnings (and it will) it's going to be like Free money. Easiest 10+% you can get right now."
How am I the only one posting on here? This is the deal of a lifetime. A portfolio with AEO is a better portfolio.
I’m going long on AEO. Solid fundamentals and likely to survive a recession if one occurs. Right now seems like a good time to dollar cost average into AEO as it touches new lows. Scale and build your position overtime!
Almost all stocks are red. Market is down and AEO is nicely UP. Looks like something is cooking 
"I posted a similar message on GPS...this stock is drifting off into space. When does it end? At this pace, the stock will hit zero 10-15 days. Makes no sense. Delta variant, the powers that be can't let a good crisis end. When does it end? We will be dealing with the virus or some form of it for many years to come and will likely never go away. Cramer has been pumping this stock for at least a month (and at much higher prices). Back to school is near and retail season has been incredible this summer. I think you have to be a buyer on days like today."
The shorts are flat out wrong on this one. Thanks for the cheap shares this morning though!Long AEO
Wells Fargo/JP Morgan bought more.https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AEO/institutional-ownership/
American Eagle Outfitters reached a 52 Week high at 25.05
"Down again, like I said, it won't hold. You people talking about 1 month performance, basically EVERYTHING is up, haha. If you think this will go anywhere you haven't been paying attention long enough. Since 2018, look at the chart, straight down, omg. You have Jay and company to thank for that, he treats his shareholders so great."
"4% jump today, awesome. One of Wall streets best buys right here."
All strong retailers have reported strong #'s. Who cares what Nordstrom reported.
"NO DEBT and safe div with buy back and nice pill of cash. I'll also say it Congratulations everyone esle did in that sweet CC. WELL done great outlook TY I picked up 1,000 more shares should of got more at 13 avg down O WELL"
"BUYING THE DIP, its deeply discounted. AERIE is booming."
Looks like a good buy here now at $18.50. Anyone buying or adding?
After market
"Seems to happen a lot to stocks Cramer pumps heavily. It’s almost like he’s sending a signal to HF: “I’ll create the bag holders, you take’m out”. I don’t think it’s intentional but his AA certainly sets up a table for manipulation."
Black Friday is here!
"Jabberwonky, if it does go to $27.. that's still more than $10 higher than when you were trashing it to go lower. What makes you so confident now, the broken clock theory?"
"Express came out today and reported a profit, it they could do it AEO will definitely pop."
"Bought more yesterday when it dipped below $20. Hopefully the tariffs will be short-term, but this stock felt like a bargain on a 17.5% dip."
"great products best in breed, quality sales and more quality wish I bought here"
Went back (8/16/20) to AEO to do an exchange for the kiddo. The store had no outside line but the store had a sizable crowd. Not bad for a Sunday. The other “J”.
anyone else still have that feeling this will drop below 12 tomorrow?
"I guess that AEO just has to wait their turn so the analysts can pump their stock too, I remember when I held Adient and all it ever did was get downgrade after downgrade, then all of sudden (I had sold all shares long before this though) the analysts had driven the price to around 12 and change from 80, four analysts within hours of each other came out with double upgrades and major PT changes, the price of the stock jumped from 12 to over 26 in three weeks of pure pumping. Then reality hit when their next ER came out and the stock tanked to 17-18 range, but the analysts kept pumping it, now it just languishes around 20-22 range."
I guess it’s nice to have a earnings miss already priced in :). Next Friday could be a lot of fun if they blow out earnings like we know they can!
"I read anywhere between 15-18% short as of 30 Jul, so maybe we get lucky and become a ""meme""."
Sooo is it gonna be a good earnings or nah?? I should have sold yesterday. I starting to feel it wont be a good one. Any updates much appreciated.
MAY 3RD this was 24 now it mid 16's this is a BUY. big time buy you listening to my as I type this message out on here. AEO is a buy. I'm adding left and right up and down.
looks like the buy is going to be at 3:30...
Oh look! It's flopping up again! (sorry I couldn't resist).
AEO blows past 52 week and 10 year highs...
Wow. The bears really got their claws into this stock.
"Now let's review, whether you agree that the pricing of this and the majority of the mall rats was fair in November and December of 2019, this was before Covid, this was when we had unemployment in the three percent range, we had no fears of inflation, we had no fears of new or rising taxes and we had by all rights a booming economy. So fast forward to Covid, retail tanks, now still in Covid times though supposedly experiencing the reopening trades and the price is nearly three times higher than pre-Covid and the company will still not be at pre-Covid levels nor will they be profitable at least on an annual basis for awhile yet. So what is going on here and across the sector? Tech was overbought, retail and restaurants are grossly overbought. AEO is a very good company, but how do you justify these prices when they couldn't have been justified less than two years ago in a vastly superior economic environment."
Aeo will start its upward trend today
"A gift at this price, $40 after earnings report"
"Anyone selling any stocks today, tomorrow, next week are playing into the hands of the billionaires club, working in unison with their liberal news media in an attempt to defeat a populist President, they will end up making trillions of dollars once the false narratives pass and the truth is finally told, the flu is responsible for over 500K deaths a year, over one billion people get the flu every year. The Corona virus has a mortality rate of less than one percent."
"AEO UPGRADED TO BUY! BY D.A. DAVIDSON, which called the apparel retailer an innovative competitor with ""ON-POINT"" Messaging to its customers. AKA ahead of the curve! buy buy buy"
"think earnings will be good, thoughts?"
"They are in on AI IN A BIG WAY, Clothes look great - prices are amazing,Many pop ups - amazing deals and beautiful beautiful clothing FLY AEO,￼"
"It's underpriced compared to the retail industry average, their cashflow is good and their recent clothes are pretty good if you like cheap and simple. Was actually considering buying some so I think the earnings will be met at least. This has the potential of doing really well in the long term."
"The other J. Keep in mind right after the Ex-D the usually pull back some a couple of days. AEO will be fine in the long haul. Next up after the Holiday season, summer then back to school. And Dividends along the way."
"David, in the reality of a market where we have so much wealth in the hands of so few people and organizations and add that to the fact that High Frequency Trading, aka computer trading and computer algorithms, manipulation and market control is actually quite easy. As it was in the early days of ADRs and the advent of arbitrage, the wealthy will always find a way to control markets to create additional wealth for themselves and their families and friends. If two groups of people, say Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs decided to work in unison to drive a stock down or up randomly it could be accomplished in this manner. MS puts a buy in for a large lot size at a price much below or above a stock's current price, GS puts a sell in for the same or even slightly less or more so not to attract too much attention, the deal closes and the two companies can sell back and forth the same lot multiple times at various prices either higher or lower than the previous deal to drive the stock one way or the other. It is also very difficult for someone to try and pick off one of those trades since the size of the order. The companies trade the same 100K lot of stock one hundred times, the volumes look huge and the transactions happen so fast that no one is the wiser, the companies really don't lose any money as they are traded the same stocks back and forth, so the only loss would be for the initial and the last order, just make sure they are the same. Also, depending on whether the game plan is to tank the stock, both of the brokerage houses, short the stock, if it is to drive it up, they take long positions prior to the pumping. Computers make this a very simple game and the SEC lacks the sophistication or the tools (super computers) to track the activity."
"Haha, headed back to 27 just like I said. This thing will never do anything long-term."
Price Targets are being Lowered by multiple analysts ..that's why the stock is down
I’m curious - lulu came out with food guidanxe and stock shoots up. Aeo came out with good news too - pop was very short lived. What’s the difference ? Long aeo
"Here is text from Ortex ""Buy"" signal issued today for AEO: ""An EPS (Type 2) buy signal has been triggered which shows that, over the last 6 years, whenever American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. has entered EPS (Type 2) Buy, the stock has gone up by an average of 3.76% over the 4 trading days following the signal. This signal has triggered 15 times over this period and has been successful 80% of the time."""
"5 year Cash Flow growth rate -34%, 5 year rev growth 1.3%, projected growth 8%. That's a nice multiple for a company with such prospects, lol."
How many people take their kids to Nordstrom for back to school shopping. LOL! You cannot compare Nordstrom to AEO
"In northwest GA, the AEO store at the outlet shopping center had one of the longest lines to enter to shop. This is a county that is going back to school in a couple weeks. Lots of shoppers throughout the center, but AEO seemed very popular."
Wonder how their online business is doing currently?
Something is shady why do they need the 400mill loan with an option to convert in 4 years @8.5$ ??? They had prior to the corona over 200mill in cash + government is lending now millions for 3% interest. Can someone please explain this???
Increased position today. Now holding 3400 shares at cost basis of $16.78. Now just wait for the madness to pass and enjoy the ride back up. Might be late this year but it will come
"Dec 11 feel like a real beat is setting up here. Lots of trends with the teens really fit here with there clothes at a great consumer price point. ""VSCO"" girl and the like. Plus the online exposure. Anyone else have an opinion?"
