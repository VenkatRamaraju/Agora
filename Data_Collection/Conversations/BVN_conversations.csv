"Itronics Discovers Strong Evidence Of A Tertiary Polymetallic Low Sulfidation Gold System At Its Auric Fulstone Gold Silver Zinc Copper ProjectRENO, Nevada, March 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) an “Innovative Zero Waste” technology company that produces GOLD’n GRO fertilizers, and silver products, today reported that its subsidiary Whitney & Whitney, Inc. has identified strong evidence for a Tertiary polymetallic low sulfidation gold system at the Auric Gold & Minerals, Inc. Fulstone Gold Silver Zinc Copper exploration project in the Yerington Mining District in northwestern Nevada.The newly identified mineralization is in a valley which is being named “The Golden Valley Prospect”. The Golden Valley Prospect samples are indicating strong gold mineralization accompanied by anomalous silver, zinc, and copper. There is a zone of anomalous gold, silver, and zinc mineralization about 1,000 feet to the north of Golden Valley that is about 1,000 feet by 600 feet in area and a zone of intensely bleached and altered rock about 500 feet east of Golden Valley that is about 1,000 feet by 2,000 feet in area. Both of these zones are believed to be associated with the newly discovered mineralization in Golden Valley and are potentially all part of the newly identified mineralization as described below. The Golden Valley Prospect is the third gold occurrence to be identified in the Buckskin Range and is the second surface occurrence. The first is a high grade gold-copper surface vein system at the Buckskin Mine about six miles to the south that was discovered in the early 1900’s. The second is a deep high grade copper-gold system about 3 miles to the south that was discovered by Anaconda Copper in the early 1970’s, but that was not developed. Field examination of a Landsat color anomaly in Golden Valley on which a significantly anomalous gold-in-soil sample was taken revealed a strongly clay-altered and heavily limonite-stained intrusive andesite porphyry subcrop-probably a leached cap, which is so strongly jointed as to appear shattered- adjacent to weakly-stained calc-siltstone. A part of this color anomaly was tested with two traverses of soil-plus-rock samples. The traverses were comprised of 50 foot spaced samples on a 350 foot long Northeast-Southwesterly line, and on a 400 foot long Northwesterly-Southeasterly line, including rock/soil sampling, in the fall of 2018.Multi-element analyses of 17 follow-up soil plus rock Golden Valley samples indicate that all “grab” samples of the andesite porphyry leached cap and calc-siltstone are anomalous geochemically in gold, silver, zinc, copper, and gold-pathfinder/indicator elements, and potassic clay alteration. All samples showed ppm-detectable gold- with two adjacent samples on altered porphyry showing 14.05 ppm and 0.15 ppm gold. An additional 14 altered porphyry samples and one siltstone sample assayed from 0.006 ppm to 0.058 ppm gold and averaged 0.022 ppm gold. In addition to the gold assays, average values for several gold pathfinder elements indicate an epithermal, low-sulfidation, polymetallic gold system. >>> For full article pls CLICK HERE >: http://itronics.com/030519.shtmlFollow Itronics on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itronicsinc Follow Itronics on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itronicsincVISIT OUR WEB SITE: http://www.itronics.comThe following link is to a segment done on Itronics by KOLO8 News: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYG0CIPEy1o"

"Itronics Inc. - stock symbol (ITRO)""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future Plans“Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) and its President John Whitney have always envisioned a clean, waste-free planet. Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

"Bad politics in Peru has no way to end soon. It is crushing this stock, if the socialist government stays, it might get even worse (nationalization of companies). If there is a change of government for a more free market economy this stock will bounce nicely, my opinion."

Buy tonight.
Greatly undervalued major.

"with copper prices going high, this is an undervalued company."
Any real people on this board?
I kind of like stocks where T Rowe Price have large positions. Vanguard and Blackrock own everything but T Rowe Price seems a little more particular.
Although any and all mines in South America could be benefiting from the change from fossil fuels to electric due to the need for more raw materials.. I'm thinking NEXA is a bit better foundation to grow on.. politically and how they've just added their sixth mine to their list of mines. hehe THE MAX
