From Marcus & Millichap - Inadequate supply pace sustains tight apartment vacancy. Nearly 1.4 million new households are projected to form in the U.S. this year as a result of both the aging millennial cohort and a broad-based economic improvement. Total residential completions are expected to trail that trajectory despite finalizations and permits elevating in July. Deficits of labor and lots as well as still-high material costs remain hurdles for builders to ramp up their pace. This will aggravate the housing shortage and sustain historically low multifamily availability as the lack of affordable single-family homes for sale leads many households to keep flexible apartment leases. Tight rental unit availability should promote rent growth in most markets across the nation.

"Apartments attracting more investors. Investor confidence in multifamily is strengthening after the record-setting second quarter performance and an outlook that is bolstered by a lack of moderately priced homes available for purchase. The buyer pool for apartments is growing, facilitating a competitive bidding market. Multifamily assets traded for an average of $171,000 per unit over the past year ended in June, up 5 percent annually. Meanwhile, the average cap rate fell 20 basis points to 5.1 percent as aggressive pricing is applying downward pressure."
