"RSF [Rights Offering completed @ 19.30] continues to do well since their Rights Offering [ending 1/6/21], and their announcement that their expiration of their repurchase of their stock was completed at 16.39 [on 1/8/21].... Currently RSF trades at a discount with their current MktPrc [COB Friday] of 19.84 against their NAV of 20.16. Unusual since most CEF's are at premiums [not discounts] in this over heated market.... Current monthly dividend [COB Friday] is currently 9.21%...Disclosure: Currently hold a substantial position in RSF [along with CapGains already taken]...."

The dividend yield looks good but the net expense ratio is 6.74%. SO really you're only getting about 4% and the BDCs the fund owns don't tend to make spectacular moves up or down. I've owned ARCC for years and this fund owns that one among others and the BDC bonds but the individual components owned by RSF don't charge an expense fee.
