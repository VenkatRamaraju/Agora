Another nail in the coffin today for SJW. CA regulators failed to act on the request to merge with ctws until ct regulators act. This will add another 12-18 months to this process.
"with the merger with the east, a stronger company with good earnings. there seems to be a trend on consolidatind the water business. better companies go in with solid agreement then hostile."
SJW is up 12.06% to 63.76
"Is this a utility company or a high growth tech stock? P/E around 50 , missing by far 3Q est. in rev. and eps , negative growth. Who is buying at 70+ even before earning release? Absolute short target irrespective of what market doing."
These crooks doubled our water bill this month citing Covid.

What is the best water investment. Is there an ETF? Thanks
Is that 70 bucks still available??
Looking good but not so much for my quest to add more at the sub-$30 levels...
Going up on earnings after market close!
It is me or does an 85.5% payout ratio and 570M in new debt service and a 50 PE not jive? A 50% share price haircut (or more) and an even bigger Div cut doesnt seem out of order here at all.
