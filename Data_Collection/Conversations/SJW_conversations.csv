Nice downgrade for these dopes today by Evercore. Would love to know end game-they should sell to CA Water for 70 bucks and do what is right for shareholders!!!
Going up on earnings after market close!
"with the merger with the east, a stronger company with good earnings. there seems to be a trend on consolidatind the water business. better companies go in with solid agreement then hostile."
SJW/CTWS Nit Wits plan to refile in CT. Definition of insanity- doing the exact same thing over and over again andexpecting a different outcome!!

It is me or does an 85.5% payout ratio and 570M in new debt service and a 50 PE not jive? A 50% share price haircut (or more) and an even bigger Div cut doesnt seem out of order here at all.

Is it me or does a 73 PE on a water utility with 3 times the market cap in debt and a 173% payout ratio not end well?

"Is this a utility company or a high growth tech stock? P/E around 50 , missing by far 3Q est. in rev. and eps , negative growth. Who is buying at 70+ even before earning release? Absolute short target irrespective of what market doing."

Another nail in the coffin today for SJW. CA regulators failed to act on the request to merge with ctws until ct regulators act. This will add another 12-18 months to this process.
