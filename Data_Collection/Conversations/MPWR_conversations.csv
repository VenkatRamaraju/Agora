hmm. why the weakness?
"@peacenick - 5 months ago when MPWR was trading around $300 you said "" This is going to 200 before it goes to 400."" Well it broke $400 on 7/21 and $500 on 9/22. You could not have been more wrong. How did that work out for you? Average price target from 8 analysts is $513."

UMC is way undervalued! The stock fair value is $3.5 to $4.5! The stock price has not advanced for a long while! The other semiconductor stock has gained 20% to %80% in average.
Investors don't need these legal morons suing the company. The only ones who will benefit are the lawyers.
Why does this happens... earning beat and price falls... I hate stonks.

"Up 15% in the last month and up 50% in the last year! There is a lot of optimism in the semiconductor industry. ADI has had the same performance after buying Linear Technology. Where does it stop, only the shadow knows. Historically, this has been a boom and bust industry. My advice to my co-workers in the Y2K era, just take half of your stock option gains if it is enough to retire on...I did, and now I AM retired. Soon after the year 2000, the Semi industry went soft for many years. Patience is good but greed is bad. This is a message to all of my past co-workers in the semiconductor industry."

I'm selling my shares at this point. It will never get this high again. It's just too overbought. If you hold here I think you're probably nuts. Taking advantage of the purely computer electronic trading going on today and tomorrow with no one awake at the wheel. It's only 491K but just giving my other long friends fair warning. BYE!

looks like raised guidance
Stock down $30 or 15% from it's high of $193/share. Corona virus negative stimulus?
"Technical school in Kirkland, WA, closes after faculty member tests positive for coronavirus. This is just 5.7 miles away from Monolithic Power's facility. This virus is showing up everywhere."
