"This is why it is good to buy strangles and be both long and short on stocks that are attacked by short sellers. One thing is for sure, you will get volatility. I wouldn't have cared if this went down to the ground. Just move a lot puppy dog."

UMC is way undervalued! The stock fair value is $3.5 to $4.5! The stock price has not advanced for a long while! The other semiconductor stock has gained 20% to %80% in average.

"Up 15% in the last month and up 50% in the last year! There is a lot of optimism in the semiconductor industry. ADI has had the same performance after buying Linear Technology. Where does it stop, only the shadow knows. Historically, this has been a boom and bust industry. My advice to my co-workers in the Y2K era, just take half of your stock option gains if it is enough to retire on...I did, and now I AM retired. Soon after the year 2000, the Semi industry went soft for many years. Patience is good but greed is bad. This is a message to all of my past co-workers in the semiconductor industry."
Investors don't need these legal morons suing the company. The only ones who will benefit are the lawyers.

I'm selling my shares at this point. It will never get this high again. It's just too overbought. If you hold here I think you're probably nuts. Taking advantage of the purely computer electronic trading going on today and tomorrow with no one awake at the wheel. It's only 491K but just giving my other long friends fair warning. BYE!

Another home run for MPS.
sorry stocks trading at all time highs will see multiple compression when interest rates go up. This is going to 200 before it goes to 400.
I’m thinking there could be a serious investigation coming up...
MPS is poised to drop 10-15% on profit taking in next few days. the long term outlook is ok.
