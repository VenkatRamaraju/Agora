Every once and awhile I check this company. No change. Still bad management and an ineffective growth strategy. Just cashing checks and waiting for the shoe to fall.

"Dril-Quip is the last major American owned Oilfield Equipment Manufacturer. Cameron and FMC are owned by the French and the old Vetco is owned by GE. 3 years ago I suggested for them to get some government contracts, breech blocks, tank parts or even aircraft landing gears....all I heard was crickets and you are laid off. You have a billion dollar machine shop, do something."
