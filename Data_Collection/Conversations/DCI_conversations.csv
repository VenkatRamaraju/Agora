"! month and 1 year chart both looks very bullish. The acquisitons last year starts contributing to the bottom and top line. This baby can grow. I recently pass by a surper market, I see their machine, I pass by a foodcourt , DC bank machine is upfront of a phone accessories shop. This tells me that the profitable business has extended their reach every where I go and stable business. The time and gas to drive to a banking machine does not worth the while, you pay a little for the convience of getting the money . Great business model with the new model introducing this year/early next year for currency exchange , possible small loan function, this will add to revenue and bottom line. There is always a place for cash society. I like QIWI as well. QIWI has lots of cash and should buy out DCI or join forces, this will boost both stock price by 20% easily. Both are great cash generation business. The eletronic payment part is big and growing. I hope DCI will partner with QIWI and roll out more of the DC tags , perhaps partner with Apple with the patented technology, then this stock will fly. ."

"I am currently Short a lot of shares of KIRK at $26.57 average price, as a Pure Earnings Short Sell play. KIRK reports earnings pre-market on Tuesday, and I am expecting a significant stock price decline in imediate response to the earnings release. Later tomorrow I will be Covering my KIRK Short, and the plan is to immediately throw all my hard cash into a new Pure Earnings Short Sell of...DCI. Here we have another Bloated Baby offering an excellent opportunity for savvy traders like me to realize a 3-8+% single day cash profit based upon the stock collapsing in price in direct response to her earnings release. Why is DCI my #1 Pure Earnings Short Sell play for tomorrow?? Consider:1: DCI is significantly over-valued and close to her 52 week high. 2: Charts are indicating bearishness for the near and mid-term. 3: Just a few days ago the company decided to increase their Dividend payout percentage. Savvy traders KNOW this is very often a manipulative ploy used by companies to try to prop up their share price in the short-term, based upon knowledge of poor earnings results or other negative news due to surface in the near-term.4: Analysts are lukewarm on DCI, average rating is a Hold. 5: Analysts see little impetus for DCI stock price to go up much from the $61 level, even looking out 12 months forward. 6: Overall financials are simply average, nothing to justify current valuation, much less a move up in stock price absent an outstanding earnings report with very positive forward Guidance, which is very unlikely to occur on Wednesday pre-market. For all these reasons and more, the odds strongly favor DCI selling off in direct response to her earnings release on Wednesday. 75% odds of success with a 3-8% downside move likely, make this my choice as the PESS Play of the Day tomorrow. :-)"

"Earnings are out and as I anticipated, they look bad. Misses on both EPS and Revenue, and the stock is indicated to open down. This would have been a very good Short play, but...I was a chicken and did not pull the trigger. Still sitting on GIII, long 2000 shares and hoping she bounces back up today..."

"Nice to see this Bloated Baby is up on the day. I am now eagerly looking to Sell Short a lot of DCI shares before market close today. This is going to be a Pure Earnings Short Sell. DCI reports earnings before market open Wednesday morning, and I am expecting weak and disappointing results, to trigger an immediate and significant sell-off of 3-8% during tomorrow's regular trading session, perhaps more if there is a real miss on EPS or Revenue consensus estimates.Just watching for now, hoping this pops up a bit more to the $62.40+ level, but will definitely be Shorting a lot of shares before market close today. Good Luck Folks!"
"Donaldson is a good boring business, however not one to invest when the stock price is in exuberant territory. https://svencarlin.com/donaldson-stock-analysis/"

"Anybody else thinking of Shorting this one today, just as an Earnings play?? I'm thinking about it, she looks weak and overbought to me, but...I probably won't do it. CRM, GIII, and RH are all looking better to me, as Long plays over the next few days. But still...I think this one will sell off after earnings..."

"Just Sold Short a lot of DCI shares at an average price of $62.36, just before market close. Got a great fill price as this Bloated Baby kept going up into the close, on irrational exuberance regarding her upcoming quarterly earnings release. DCI reports earnings before market open tomorrow, and I am pleased as punch to be Short thousands of shares through this earnings release. I am expecting DCI to sell off significantly in direct response to this ER, tomorrow. Looking for a 3-8% drop tomorrow, perhaps more if they miss on EPS or Revenue consensus estimates, which is perfectly possible. Even if they handily beat consensus estimates, I expect the stock price to go down tomorrow, making this a 75-80% likely win-win situation! Good Luck Folks! :-)"

DCI set to release a positive earnings report next Thursday plus they just raised the dividend. There is usually a price run-up prior to good earnings but not this quarter.Not sure why. Any ideas?

"Covered my DCI Pure Earnings Short Sell at $63.69 average price for a loss of just about $3.4k. Immediately jumped into a new Pure Earnings Short Sell of SPLK at an average price of $123.07. Looking to make back my entire DCI loss and much more, if this SPLK Short Sell goes my way. Good Luck Folks!"
