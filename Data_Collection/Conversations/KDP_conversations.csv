"I see in the short term this stock at 30, but profits and share buybacks will need to occur in order for this stock to go up further... Green mountain coffee needs to step up and have better margins going forward."
Somebody needs to write the complete profile for this new company.
"I am a long term holder and will continue to hold. But for me, 1,000 shares is enough."
KDP just announced eps of $.25 $.02 more then expected. Good sign for the future !
I heard about KDP the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

solid report and increasing sales guidance for the full year! old projections of 3-4% sales growth now increased to 4-6% sales growth. Long and strong!
So it seems that the 10% div that Yahoo is showing isn't correct
"My old Keurig machine gave up the ghost last weekend, so I went to WalMart and bought a new one--they only had one model and the shelf was almost empty. I went to their website to register it, and used the coupon for 5 boxes of coffee pods for 50% off that came with it. I was so impressed with how it worked (much faster than the old one), that Monday through Wednesday I started buying shares, and with a total of 35 shares/$1202 total investment, I've already made enough gain to pay for the new Keurig! LOL, this morning's Green Mountain coffee sure tastes good!"
"I think KDP should increase their dividends even more because they still have incredibly high cash flow. However, the stock’s growth is better than KO or PEP, so I’m not complaining so much. However, I do think higher dividends will incentivize more eager investors. But I’m liking the direction they are going with the 0.75 dividend for 2021. Plus, Dr Pepper is the superior soda :)"
An excellent report. Both businesses growing. Positive outlook.
"I sold all my Coca Cola shares and bought this instead. Better product, less political, better outlook and increasing their dividends. Let’s go"
"Seems to me, from looking through company's current financials, that KDP is currently undervalued and share price not yet reacted to the excellent fourth quarter and full year '20 reporting results coming up..Bought calls"
KDP beat EPS by $.03 and also beat rev. KDP has paid 500+ million off of debt! Great news.
KDP didn't make the S&P again.
"Stock buy back! Nice, and investor day today. Hopefully some more good news. They already re-iterated forecasts."
That was a great report and guidance. Curious to see how the market reacts. Maybe $25 and trending up.
Ex dividend date Oct 5
"Everything is better, Dr Pepper"
"I saw an article they may look for a buyout up to 20billion. That would be stupid. The stock hasn't done anything and all a buyout of that magnitude would do is increase debt, stall the stock price for a couple years. They should buy back more stock, raise dividend and grow organically. A 20 billion deal would turn the stock into permanent stagnation. Makes me concerned who is running the company. No more large deals please."
