"I sold all my Coca Cola shares and bought this instead. Better product, less political, better outlook and increasing their dividends. Let’s go"
Do they report after the bell?
"yoo-hoo is the single greatest beverage ever invented! so yeah, I'm going to take a long position on that company"
Really..? I don’t get it
KDP beat EPS by $.03 and also beat rev. KDP has paid 500+ million off of debt! Great news.
"Thinking about buying into kdp, any thoughts?"
Just hit all time midday high today
"I have been following JAB since they purchased Keurig some years ago. This is way out of the normal for them as they primarily were purchasing companies associated with early morning retail such as bagels, coffee, etc. So buying a beverage company is not in their normal market. Plus as far as I know they have always kept their companies private. This 87% private and 13% public is definitely odd for them. Not sure why they did it nor how long they will allow it to exist."
Buy now before it's too late. Will hit 30 on friday!!!
KDP should make an investment in ACB before KO or PEP beats them to it.
"This is a great deal. If you like making money, you’d be dumb not to buy and hold it long term."
Is anyone even active on this board ????
"Love this stock, pre-market is up again. Hot stock with a lot of products like 7-up, Snapple, keurig coffee, etc., more than 22B market cap, nice dividends.This new co is hot!!! Will be up to $30 in a few days. Buy,buy,buy!!!"
"New all time high today, since the merger last July"
When will the dividend payment arrive in the Robinhood app?
Thanks for the discount day traders ;-p
Surely KDP stock should be trading higher than mid twenties.
Why is this showing a 10% dividend? Are interns in charge of Yahoo Finance?
An excellent report. Both businesses growing. Positive outlook.
"It is also funny to see $KO copy the $KDP strategy (or attempt to) on coffee with Costa, and how KDP is expanding in non-CSDs with CORE and the new Evian distribution agreement. $KO followed the old Dr. Pepper strategy on its bottlers many years ago; and now they are doing it again. Says to me that $KDP has (again) the winning strategy -- and is ahead of the game. Nice moves up, but only just getting started with the very small float available to non JAB holders."
Since the merger KDP hasn't missed an earnings estimate. The current estimate has them up 6% YOY. Pepsi is up after beating their estimate even though it's down 1.9% YOY. Barring outside influence or missed estimates we should have a great holiday season.
"KDP Chief Corp Affairs Officer Maria A. Sceppaguercio-Gever purchased the last 2 days shares totaling 42,498 shares for an average of $23.53 per filling of Form 4."
Somebody needs to write the complete profile for this new company.
Hmmm. With Mondelez owning 14% of the company...I wonder if they'd ever consider buying the whole thing to create their own version of Pepsi Co -- snacks & drinks.
BEST STOCK FOR LONG TERM IT WILL BE 100 DOLLAR IN 5 YEARS
Is KDP looking to invest in cannibos?
WHAT % DIVIDENT DOES THIS PAY ? ?
Optimistic about the earnings report tomorrow
Should move up soon
"I saw an article they may look for a buyout up to 20billion. That would be stupid. The stock hasn't done anything and all a buyout of that magnitude would do is increase debt, stall the stock price for a couple years. They should buy back more stock, raise dividend and grow organically. A 20 billion deal would turn the stock into permanent stagnation. Makes me concerned who is running the company. No more large deals please."
"buy now as it will grow , in 5 years it will be over $100.00"
"Mondelez owns 14% of kdp. They know kdp has good potential to become more than $100/share stock. Look at fizz, I haven't heard this company but per share is >$100. Be patient and keep adding shares."
Staying above the $30 range and now pushing for $31. Looking forward to last quarter results and an increase in dividend.
Thanks DPS / KDP for the terrific 2018 performance. One of my best stocks over the last 6 years.
why was I able to buy calls yesterday but can't sell them today? says option cannot be traded right now?
"hmmm, big deal with starbucks and nestle, no pre market action"
I got my special dividend yesterday - but still have not received KDP shares. Others have received KDP shares but no special dividend. What is going on here? Seems very irregular and dis-organized to me. Any commentary appreciated.
"Stock buy back! Nice, and investor day today. Hopefully some more good news. They already re-iterated forecasts."
I opened a new position today on this weakness. Temporary with ACORN selling shares to increase public float to 20%. A gift to those who want in at atemporarily suppressed price.
"Wow and I though I had a good deal at 24.25, business can't be so bad that it will drop to 21."
Do investors get a coupon for a free coffee maker?
"Dividend need to be increase next quarter please! Also, I want this stock to break $32 dollars a share and make me more money. This is my New Years resolution... Let's go KDP!"
Why no dividend information?
dr pepper tastes good
In a better position debt wise compared to Pepsi & coke
"Director Robert S. Singer purchased on Aug 10 10,000 shares for $23.75 per Form 4."
KDP just became a merged company and has a fantastic product line. Will compete with KO and PEP. KDP will soon announce a .15/ quarter dividend. This will likely grow as the company profits grow. KDP sells products in 130 countries. Give this merger time and growth will continue.
Thought of adding to my Portfolio however the stores never have the products. Can not figure out how they can make Money when not selling anything? Diet Rite and Dr. Pepper.
"Great quarter , how about raising the dividend!!!"
"Issuing more shares, Lowering stock value, what’s next, lowering dividend payment!!!"
Made lots of money off of Green Mountain Coffee before it went private. I also buy their product. This is a coffee / Green Mountain / Keurig play for me. Dr. Pepper brands are just meh just more sugar drinks nobody is drinking right now. Maybe that part of the business will wise up and figure out what consumers want these days.
"Haven't had root beer for a long time. Decades. Something was wrong with the sweetness and the flavor was lacking. But recently, because Walmart doesn't carry Birch Beer, decided to try A&W root beer. Let me tell you. It was full bodied, almost creamy like the foam on a good beer. It was delicious. Maybe it was the aged vanilla. Keep up the good work. O, and no caffeine."
"broken stock...was 118 a share, down to 23 bucks a share, hasn't done anything since 2018."
So it seems that the 10% div that Yahoo is showing isn't correct
Bought a few of the $37 call option for December theyre real cheap hoping for something great
"Management positive outlook for the year, per 10k. Page: 24 if anyone wants to read"
Check SEC filings.
Bought 4350 shares...Hopefully will recover tomorrow
"Now whats up, it's sure not KDP. What is the problem causing drop in price?"
"Core is pretty big with kid athletes in my area, this should be a great brand at add"
T has such horrible management compared to these guys. Selling my T shares soon and moving to KDP and VYM after I heard T was lowering their dividend. Plus this company is getting their act together and have plenty of room for growth compared to its competitors.
loved this company forever. been here since early DPS days.this stock is slowly but surely heading back to 120 per share.
"Very nice Action today so far, slow climb to $35 by end of year?"
Keurig Dr Pepper reached a 52 Week high at 33.07
So is this going to be paying a 9% dividend or not?!
How can this dividend be paid? Is this an error?
"Looks like money moved away from KDP to chase the high flying tech stocks. Should move back soon, along with div reinvests this looks ready for a big pop."
Continues to show nice positive action.
"I am a long term holder and will continue to hold. But for me, 1,000 shares is enough."
"DP is only about 14% of the company. My understanding is that the rest of this company is still private. Am I correct. If so, I don’t see much of an increase in dividends for sometime. Please correct me if I’m wrong"
Odd question. My online broker portfolio still shows my trade price of dps of $84 for the symbol of kdp. As a result it reads as if I bought kdp at $84 and then lost 75% in the stock with it now around $24.. I thought kdp's trade price should have changed to $20.50. Am I wrong?
What happened with the big drop ?
What's the market cap of this Big Boy? KDP? Anybody know. It seems like a great new company. Welcome everybody to the new KDP board.
"I think KDP should increase their dividends even more because they still have incredibly high cash flow. However, the stock’s growth is better than KO or PEP, so I’m not complaining so much. However, I do think higher dividends will incentivize more eager investors. But I’m liking the direction they are going with the 0.75 dividend for 2021. Plus, Dr Pepper is the superior soda :)"
Dr. Pepper Fansville for the win.
Patience will win the day here. Within 5 years we can reasonably assume the share price will be over 100.00. While being paid a little dividend along the way.It is safe money.
Love that Diedrich French Roast blend. That's why I'm long on KDP.

"As I expected, a very good quarter and NO increase in dividends. Not even a mention that a dividend increase in the future might be issued."
"Fun fact, KDP has an 18% market share of the soft drink industry compared to 24% for Pepsi and 44% for Coke."
"KDP should invest in,and partner with PYX. Read the Citron Research report."
"This stock is very cheap, time to buy now before it hits above $30 in a few days."
"agreed, screw coke and pepsi too for that matter. DP always the king of colas! :)"
What a great quarter! Gonna crack open a can of Dr Pepper to celebrate.
More insider buying. At market prices. Bodes well.
Will core hurt Bai growth????
Now it pays a nice dividend. It should be a screaming buy!! ￼
"Why So Slow, Beat earnings. Outlook good. So we got $31.90 for 2 hours last week. frustrating."
"Doctor, Doctor...give me the news! I gotta bad case of lovin’ you!"
"Great end to the week for KDP, happy holidays fellow shareholders"
Hoping to see a small increase in the dividend next month!!
Core looks like a good acquisition. Health conscience millineals should be into it.
"Have been watching KDP for a while, but the dividend is not that good. I think I may look elsewhere."
"Someone explain this stock to me. It merges together, the price falls by 80%. It has a current PE ratio of .22 and its forward dividend is going to be almost 10%?! Am I mistaken this seems like a no brainer to buy the stock while its price is so low. Please let me know if I am wrong."
where's my dividend payouts!
"Want to buy in, however can't find total outstanding shares ? Rev estimates or any real relevant info. I like DR Pepper/Snapple and Green Mountain before it was bought out. Anyone have the market cap, outstanding shares ect ?"
I wonder how many points kdp could jump if a good quarterly earnings emerges..
Hello future millionaires
"It's tax time. E*TRADE states that the special cash dividend from the Dr. Pepper-Snapple + Keurig merger is considered ""Return of Capital"" which is not taxable. And the new Keurig Dr. Pepper shares are considered a qualified dividend that is taxable. Is this correct?"
Anyone that knows anything about investing can tell KDP is an amazing stock reading at a discounted price. Really glad I’m getting in at the price I am. Eventually the market will realize what this stock is. Then it’s to the moons ladies and gentlemen!!
Just another great chance to buy on the dip down.
"I exited my position last week, but thanks to all those deserters for getting me back!"
If KDP could mirror PEP success I believe in few years we will see $60-$80/share. As long as they remain innovative which I believe they will. Long KDP. I also suspect as earnings increase also will dividends. Over past 2 months a lot of insiders have been buying the stock. There must be a reason.
Hopefully this dip holds until pay day lol
Hoping for $37 soon
"I have great confidence on this stock. Since tues, it has gone up $3/share. That is more than $4000!!! And it is still going up. Hope it just go up to 30/share on Fri or next week. You guys are losing a lot of money by just watching the action. Buy, buy, buy.."
"I love 7-up. There are 2 things though. One is, if you buy a 2 litre, its much cheaper than a 6 pack of smaller bottles. But, the smaller bottles will always have carbon dioxide, which is important near the end.The 2nd issue is, whats with the label ? When room temperature, it feels normal, feels dry.Put the bottle in the fridge, and the label feels mushy, maybe even moldy-like. Take a look at it. Its not a good feel, getting that squishy bottle out of the fridge."
"Very nice upward movement since merger, $30 at new year. Long live kdp!!!"
solid report and increasing sales guidance for the full year! old projections of 3-4% sales growth now increased to 4-6% sales growth. Long and strong!
"Today’s the day we all have been waiting for, the first quarter of the combined company, KDP."
Whats going on here?
Ex dividend date Oct 5
"Big red was a regional purchase, 200 million a popular company in Texas only. Distribution will not come to the east or the west."
An innovative company NEXE.V on the TSX has patent protected vegetable based coffee pods . Working on lucrative contracts . Check it out!
"Everything is better, Dr Pepper"
That was a great report and guidance. Curious to see how the market reacts. Maybe $25 and trending up.
Seems to be drifting downward.
"KDP EPS and forward statements will easily push stock into the $40's, look for new products very soon and exciting"
A rotten time for a secondary offering with the market collapsing they should hold it off.
"Slow steady growth for this future year, it is recession proof too."
KDP will in time eclipse the old highs of DPS.
Does KDP distribute Polar Seltzer for them or does Polar own KDP too? Doing some research thnx
"What do you guys think about kdp, good place to put the money or what ? :P"
"I’m looking to buy, company looks very promising and due for a big gain"
If you want great quality coffee from your K cup I suggest using honey and maple syrup together and almond/coconut milk using 2 kcup 4oz brew. Definitely will be a game changer to your morning coffee.
They had some interesting insights about KDP on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Must say I don’t like the new DRIP of KDP. Going from zero fees to 5%. Plus cost for each share purchased, being small time investor. Even charging to reinvest divys!"
We've been moving boys and girls.
Robinhood has this temporarily unavailable. Hope it gets fixed soon so I can buy more
KDP should have been $29's if the market does not tank today. Next week it might see $29 then $30's !
This is a good company with great market penetration and a wide range of products... not to mention the massive distribution network....and I'm looking forward to the performance of this stock.
Revenues are growing. Why isn’t the dividend?
Strong q4 and big stock pop coming soon!
"All our gains last month, lost In two days!"
"Just received my last dividend reinvestment to day, next one should be hopefully an increase !!"
What was the dividend of DP before merger and what was the Kuerig dividend before merger?
Why is it down?
Best stock and they have a best team. Results can be seen after 10 years.
Hearing rumor that KDP is buying Cheer Wine CB!
In a lot of tech and looking to get some stuff that's safer also to sell calls against. We drink lots of DP so I thought why not check it out. Can someone quickly tell me about the massive drop 3 yrs ago?
For thanksgiving dinner I had a DR.Pepper this afternoon. Delicious.
"Dropping on volume, don’t know why"
Bought more
"April 27- KDP beats on earnings, beats on revenue. After hour shares up 7%. As an investor for the last seven years, this is a keeper. The company should go back to raising the dividend."
KDP has made some new brewer offerings for the season. I believe the expansion from only coffee makers will be successful in raising more business.
"DPS and KDP Drip. FYI, if you were in DPS Drip program, you were automatically entered into the KDP Drip program. You pay zero fees out of pocket."
"I had deep loyalty and love for DPS.KDP will always remain with me.I truly believe we will see 120.00 some day. and more, But I have supreme confidence in this company."
Such low float
"I honestly just love this stock lol. The drawdown in the last crash was weirdly resistant. The dividends are healthy. The growth is consistent, and the company is more of consumer staple conglomerate like KO & Pepsi, but trades at a slight discount."
Finally moving up. Hope this is the beginning of a good year.
KDP didn't make the S&P again.
Screw it in for 250 shares with a order at 24. If it hits lower I will pick up another 250 at 22.50. Really like the coffee / Dr Pepper combo with a PE of 22. Thanks for the info Richard
anyone know why Dr pepper is at a higher PE than coke or Pepsi
Good analysis comparing KDP and amazon
My sons are athletes and the amount of Body Armor they consume is off the charts. Glad they have it at Costco!!!
"Market cap is $4,320,000,000. For some reason I am not being allowed to reply to posts."
CRUSH from KDP is my favorite refreshment.
Terrible stock
"Bought DPS, bought more after it became KDP.Great company. Dividend + Stable Growth. Easy buy and hold."

Let’s get kdp to 40 this month… it totally deserves 40 bucks… I love all their brands
"KDP to increase dividends by 25% over the next two years, starting with the second quarter."
Can anybody knows insiders are buying or not ?
"I see in the short term this stock at 30, but profits and share buybacks will need to occur in order for this stock to go up further... Green mountain coffee needs to step up and have better margins going forward."
45million shares sold and only down a dollar. Sounds like an upward push is coming.
"Adding keurig to this distribution will create keurig to be sold in every deli, bagle shopp and business that sells drinks to the public. U know those Commercial coffee brewers making those pote of coffee with the brown and orange tops ..... Will be interesting to see what keurig will be selling to all those businesses."
i bought more. now at 100 shares @ $23.70.
nice and steady
"Why can't Yahoo Financial charts at the one month stop starting at minus 5 to 10 dollars below zero on the horizontal dollar scale, seems a better programmer is needed. to correct their charts."
"Another A and W Root Beer. Another frosty delight.Whatever you people are doing, its delicious.Don't change it, like Coca Cola did. I havent had a coca cola for decades."
"This is a great buy and hold. Beverage companies are cash generation machines. They will paydown debt from rev merge process quickly—both cos have a track record of doing so — and will return excess cash to shareholders via regularly increased divs and share buy backs. More importantly, will be the cost synergies and product innovation. How about taking the Keurig single serve concept over to the carb beverage side — instant soda stream competitor with branded products. Just one of many innovations (I believe) will come in the future."
Target price is $27.
Gimme dividends 
"Looking for the tippy top for this one. Loading up , Going to hold till $50."
What are your thoughts on the upcoming earnings? Any expectations?
We are setting ourselves up to enter the alcoholic beverage and cannibus infused drink market.
Finally someone like KDP besides me!!
Do they still make Diet Rite Soda? Can not find in any stores any help appreciated.
2% dividend is too low imo. Stock price needs to fall to 20 or dividend need sto be increased. This is not a growth stock.
I figure KDP is a buy in this dip since June.... But options activity today was strange and indicative of someones knowing something...Check it out... Big % increases in short term options prices even though stock price is flat/red today.
$30's soon with such great report. Long and Strong...
Will the next dividend payment show the increase?
I believe that the merger will result in a economically stronger company and look forward to a upward movement in share price.
This might be a buy at $22. I wish Yahoo would update the Summary to reflect current information.
KDP release on July 30th- EPS of $0.33 beats by $0.01; GAAP EPS of $0.21 misses by $0.10.Revenue of $2.86B (+1.8% Y/Y) beats by $50M
"So at a market cap of $4,320,000,000 for 13% of the company that means the entire company is worth $33,231,000,000. At the time of the merger/buyout announcement DPS had a cap of about $16,920,000,000. JAB bought out GMCR/Keurig in 2016 for $13,900,000,000 in cash. Give or take and assuming Keurig retained its value that means the current company should be worth just under $31,000,000,000 so it may already be overpriced."
Bring on the earnings report
What happened in 2018?It was $100.
So the recent article said keurig Dr Pepper dividend per year is 1.74. I’m guessing since mondelez international owns 13% of the share count and jab owns 72% that they aren’t going to receive dividends... so about 15% to 16% is public then I can understand how they can pay that. Someone please confirm because i saw in earlier post that they are paying only .60 cents.
"Tons of upside potential on this great company. Buy now and watch what happens to the stock price when they announce divvy, and then go get yourself a Dr. Pepper and Jack Daniels to celebrate. Unparalleled distribution network for their products and they are adding more partners."
Moving up a little by little each day. Will take it! Excited about this one as a long term hold for my porfolio.
Bought more today Long term hold for income and cap appreciation. Beverage cos are cash machines.
Warren Buffet should buy this best stock
KDP price target is $30 per B of A analysts. I believe it will pass that by end of next Q.
"Seems to me, from looking through company's current financials, that KDP is currently undervalued and share price not yet reacted to the excellent fourth quarter and full year '20 reporting results coming up..Bought calls"
Anyone here like KGKG and VATE. I see these two merge at some point then get swallowed up by KDP. Product line would be an excellent arm for KDP. 2 - 5 year outlook on this if it where to happen.
KDP just announced eps of $.25 $.02 more then expected. Good sign for the future !
"I bought DPS out of my love for DR.Pepper, and I hold KDP out of my love for DR.Pepper. 2+2=4"
LETS CROSS $30 AND STAY THERE
I read that KDP purchased s regional beverage company called Big Red. Can anyone with Knowledge of this enlighten us. Thank
