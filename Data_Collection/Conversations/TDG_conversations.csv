beat earnings report
I have this stock for a while and taken profits on 3 occasions. only my last batch needs to be sold.
"Big OEM aftermarket conglomerates like TDG have been disintermediating their supply chains for years, shrinking their distributor networks-and discounts alike....... all as they try to inch closer to the end user/operator and try to claim the ultimate control and pricing power in a forcing their proprietary shareholder value centric business model down the throat of the aftermarket. This works very well when all is rosy and the market is expanding in all directions..... fast forward 15 years to today. Now after vaporizing the middle of the supply chain the only buyers left are the operators and the large distributors that have been highly consolidate (ie: Aviall, AAR, Satair, etc.) which are public now and don't just fill the shelves with TDG products just so TDG can hit their numbers...... Good luck selling your overpriced 'highly engineered proprietary #$%$ to middle market independents and OEM authorized public companies that don't have an immediate need... which covers about everybody now.. The music has stopped and all of a sudden you have alot of parts in the supply chain, looking for a buyer and an ultimate destination..... but only a few big buyers that are all public companies and will not be bullied in to loading the shelves with TDG goods..... now EVERYBODY has to hit their numbers, even the distributors and MROs, because the all ultimately answer to the shareholder. Isn't it just amazing how greed and arrogance run full circle. OH, and now they can't make up the slow civil aftermarket sales by gouging the govt. every now and then... since the govt. now has their pricing under a microscope. This story will be amazing to watch unfold. First, Boeing with their extreme arrogance was the first domino to fall, then 1 by 1, top/down others will follow. Covid-19 will pass, and probably will have some short term negative influence.... but this industry dynamic is a cyclical reality - not to be blamed on Covid-19"
"time to short, 370 to 320 every time"
"finally a company with a nice margin in this sector, unfortunately their debt is too large and it is affecting their cash flow management"
They are shedding their all their seasoned employees to make the numbers. Short term vision may lead to long term blindness.

What an opportunity. This is awesome.
The acquisitions have lef this Company with too many moving pieces and consolidating those is the only prudent thing at this point. Have to question the dividend through borrowing decision as a desperate attempt to thwart short sellers. No real reason to do that divy deal. Lots of question marks now as growth slows and expenses and debt starts to weigh heavily. Growth through acquisitions is not nearly a perfect business model. Looking for a 20% haircut in this when the Hedgies run for the EXIT all at once.
I think TDG is down tomorrow with the bad 737 MAX news from BA. Hopefully it is down enough to make it a good buy opportunity. I think BA will ship more of their defense backlog to continue to make up for the MAX 737 earnings hole. That will mean expedite charges paid to suppliers like TDG. TDG will barely be impacted by the 737 Max delay.
I miss the special dividends; the share price appreciation is great yet I miss that periodic cash infusion. It’d be like $75/share if past practice was a guide. (I know-pigs get fat but hogs get slaughtered). Yet I’m an investor who appreciates the magic of AND and hates the tyranny of OR. Appreciation AND fat dividend please
"Airlines say they’re retiring a lot of planes which means the will need new parts, new planes. Look at ALL the various things TDG manufacturers. Not just plane parts by any means."
The CFO buy is interesting. Not big but still a purchase. Most of the executives are incentivized by stock options. Personal travel will come back very fast but business travel will never be the same.
"The problem is all of their supposed 'highly engineered proprietary products' have suddenly become a 'commodity' since the demand curve has changed. Can't cram it down the throats of distributors any longer to stuff the channel....... good luck. Alot of channel inventory will be chasing dollar bills soon. Don't think the can buy themselves out of this one, thru acquistions, sellers have wised up."
Does anybody here know whether/when the company might issue another special dividend?
"Curious that no one focused on debt in the recent earnings call. Seems to me that according to the Form 8-K filed on January 21, 2021 announcing the $1.2 billion offering to replace debt maturing in 2024, there were restrictive covenants regarding additional indebtedness, the payment of special dividends, acquisitions, etc. that previously were only in the revolving credit line and would only be triggered when borrowings under that line exceeded $266 million. A maintenance covenant would kick in then limited net debt to 7.25 times EBITDA as Defined, or slightly more than $15 billion, if my calculations are correct. Has anyone read the indenture (voluminous) filed with the reference 8-K? Are future special dividends which many of the conversation partners below are expecting now restricted? Any lawyers out there?"
"Think about this. They did $1.54 per share in the last quarter when they forced customers to take delivery within lead time. Customers were not allowed to cancel or defer, or else they would have to pay. This quarter is different. They couldn't control customers deferring orders outside of lead time. Not sure they can get rid of enough employees to make up this quarter's shortfall and still do $1.54 per share. At the high of 42X PE several months ago, this stock will take a hit in the coming weeks assuming a new level of annual earnings in the $6 to $10 per share range. Won't improve until the planes that ARE flying start to require repair."
"Reports: Senate near two-year budget deal with higher defense spending https://seekingalpha.com/news/3328935?source=ansh $LMT, $KTOS, $TDG, $BA, $NOC, $HRS, $RTN, $UTX, $TXT, $LLL, $GD, $FLIR, $COL"
"Interesting. Disclosed in recent institutional holder 13F filings, it appears that Lone Pine Capital and Principal Financial Group are sanguine about the airline industry and, when combined together, purchased 1.9 million shares over the second calendar quarter when a majority of the other big institutional holders lightened their holdings. There seems to be a divergence of opinions on the COVID-19 impact on the growth prospects of the airline industry going forward. Will those acquiring institutions keep the buying pressure on over the next quarter?"
Here comes $ 300.00. I am expecting a big rebound for TDG!!! Great Company!!!
This stock will soon back to $150. Aviation will slow and take long time to recover. If you smart sell now while still have some left.
"TSA checkpoint travel numbers show traveler throughput now is less than 25% of same weekdays last year. How can TDG still be considered a star player with premium valuation? Good management team, but with business levels impacted by continued COVID-19 crisis possibly far out in the future, it does not bode well for the aircraft maintenance business. Shouldn't this stock trade like the airlines? What am I missing?"
This stock has grown substantially. At some point the growth is going to be harder.
20 billion debt versus 2 billion EBITDA. Lower stock price for longer.
is time to short before earnings on Monday any thoughts?
"load up on tdg its cheap,right now due to ex divd drop"
Seems like a good time to sell. Lots of debt $19 billion a lot of which came from special dividends. Travel may open up with vaccine but will countries and even States allow people in? probably best to revisit stock in 6 to 12 months.
"Makes sense for key insiders to take some shares off the table. It has been a good run, and keeping the stock price where it is in a pandemic is remarkable, particularly when the company business raison d'etre to support the airline industry has been hammered. It will be interesting to see if last quarter was just a blip or a new trend."
"the key to stock market is to have a low float stock and have insider own lot of shares. people will short and stock will go up. then you can borrow money since rates are low and do lot of stock buybacks and dividends so more people will buy it. meanwhile you give yourself, tons of options if you are an insider. after many years of making millions on a monthly basis, you leave the company for ""personal"" reasons."
"Takoffs and landings still way down due to COVID-19 with no good news on the horizon. TDG is now worth more than UAL, AAL, and ALK combined! PE ratio, if you ignore trailing earnings, is in the stratosphere! Why is this a $500 stock? Is it solely because of institutional ownership and they do not know where they would put their profits if they sell? Scary!"
TDG will break through $ 600.00 soon!!! What a great company!!!
"Technical Airborne Components (""TAC"", ""the Company""), a leading designer and manufacturer of rods and struts for the aerospace industry, is pleased to announce that Searchlight Capital Partners (""Searchlight""), a leading global private investment firm, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Company from TransDigm Group Incorporated (""TransDigm Group"") (NYSE: TDG)."
anyone buying before earnings?
Zacks Rank Transdigm currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
These guys are the Valeant Pharmaceuticals of the Defense contractor business. They go around and buy specialty parts suppliers to the U.S. Military and then jack the prices up to obscene levels. Andrew Left at Citron Research did a good piece on this company thinking he could expose the scam and make money on the short side. Unfortunately for him and the American tax payer these guys are raking it in at our expense..
"What am I missing, TDG beat estimates put out good numbers and the sp drops by 20 points???"
"Tdg $TDG Stock Price Declined While Tesuji Partners Co Andrew Schaffer Cut Position by $81.88 Million; Pg & E Corp. $PCG Holder Symons Capital Management Has Lowered Its Stake by $697,682"
Makes no sense that this stock is trending higher....
"This 'pause' in the aviation industry should give rise to assessment of needs while planes are grounded due to the current crisis. Once the planes are getting back to their regular schedules - and they will, due to necessity - TDG will be doing all they can to get back up on line. Why? - Moving parts mean wear and wear necessitates repair and replace. So how do I feel? Bullish, once the crisis is truly on its way out."
"Read the 6th paragraph of Item 1.01 in the Form 8-K filed today, January 20, 2021. Looks like debt holders are tightening up a bit to protect themselves. Hope the upcoming Form 10-Q shows the quarterly revenue growth necessary to support the current valuation."
