"Could be a double from here by next year with so many potential pipeline wins,some fully owned by ions."
So what's wrong with my post Yahoo finance? Is it too truthful to post?
It is the end for our precious money

Great information from last Friday. Must be why it went up yesterday and today?http://ir.ionispharma.com/static-files/74446a65-5c47-4db6-8e46-d9a543d73454
Good news....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akcea-ionis-announce-approval-tegsedi-113000678.html
"It's been awhile since I've posted but I haven't stopped following. This period of transition from drug targeting/research and royalty based model to a more complete drug targeting/research, self marketing company has been painful for those sitting in this stock. I believe the time is now to start building a position or adding to positions. This is still in transition but under the covers progress is being made. While the near term catalysts are still trial results; what's being overlooked is their investments in their platform. Now if you don't believe in the platform by all means stay away, but a little deal they made back in July with bicycle (BCYC) to enhance their LICA delivery capabilities is right in line with IONS new business model. They also made an 11 million dollar investment in the company, it has preformed well since then. So don't get to wrapped up waiting for trial readouts, while important for verifying platform, look under the covers and realize there's more going on. To me the big one is lp(a), which is years away 2024 but we should know more about its progress in 2H of 2022. I'm getting back in at these levels GLTA.to Mike: from being all in to all out I'd suggest at least sticking your big toe in the water at this level"
"Well my friends on the IONS board, I sold my remaining IONS shares. As I posted a few months ago I had sold about 40% of my IONS position then to buy better performing companies. I have been thinking the last two or so weeks about selling my remaining IONS position to again buy stocks I feel will and are performing much better to say the least. This Bull Market has been great for wealth creation and I think I bought some good investments or trades with my IONS proceeds. I think I have time to let the 3 companies I bought with my IONS proceeds appreciate ( if my analysis is correct, no guarantees ) and if and when I take profits I can possibly buy back IONS before any seminal events occur. With the proceeds from my IONS sale I bought AMD, MRVL, and a very interesting Chinese company that I already own in another stock account. The symbol is LX and it's a seemingly very cheap stock on a PE basis and it's a small company with a seemingly huge TAM. LX is very profitable if the numbers are reliable. SO many stocks are appreciating and yet IONS is dead in the water. I still am of the opinion that IONS has incredible intrinsic value, I just don't see any near term catalysts, at least not for the next 6 months or longer, except for a buyout which is possible. Even my CCL position is going higher as IONS languishes. ROKU continues to Rocket I might even buy more, even my Tanker stocks are starting to show signs of life as are other investments I hold but IONS just stays in a tight range. I risk Murphy's Law as I held IONS perhaps 6 years at this point, I know it's been at least 5, and I made a few thousand on my long term holding. That's a gross under performance of other stocks and the market as a whole. I wish you all well, I enjoyed the conversation, I could be back soon. Good Luck my friends"

Today's news of Biogen's decision to pull the plug on their all-in gamble on targeting amyloid plaque for Alzheimer's treatment makes it far more likely that Biogen will quickly pivot to desperately attempt a buyout of a company with a much more successful R&D pipeline.....such as Ionis. A buyout price of anything less than $400/share would be an opportunity-cost disaster for Ionis shareholders.
"never bought into TSLA, but i was wrong. I I saw it as just another car company, and felt competition would eventually catch up and even put it out of business. However, maybe it is more like technology player Apple and not like a car company. But the verdict is still out. Personally, i think it is valued too high. Probably wrong again. As for IONS, this is one failure. It does have some approved drugs and a big pipeline. There will be failures, - but i don't think this failure invalidates the technology. I hope the rest of the pipeline can produce some more winners, like Spinraza .. glta"
"Its highly unlikely IONS is not bought out if shares stay sub $60.00. $80.00 would be a bargain for any buyer given the balance sheet, rev stream and the pipeline."
I heard about IONS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

Yes this stock is stuck to say the least and looking like headed right back to 45. Ownership had me fooled that with the roll out of Akca things would change for investors instead the opposite happened. They may be trying to cure many rare diseases but they might also want add their stock price to the list of things to cure.
"Close to multi year lows, one of the widest pipelines in the industry, partnering with the Pharma industry whales, narrow moat with positive moat trend (Morningstar). You know what, I'm buying at that levels and going to hold for years"
"Phil, I can image your frustration sitting in a stock for 5 years and seeing zero return but they are not selling now. If you followed this stock you should've known their business model and why I've said many times when this stock got extended that the model didn't support the valuation. You could have sold (at least some) 1 1/2 years ago and got 80+. I've also suggested they should offer at least a one time div (they ended up buying back shares) since they where sitting on 2B+ and the business model was geared towards one time and recurring rev (R&D and licensing) not drug development and commercialization which is much more expensive and riskier. Well, now they've shifted gears since Crooke retired and are doing much more of what you continually gripe about. They are looking to take drugs further into development for more lucrative licensing deals AND actually keep many drugs in house for full development and commercialization. This cost money and alot of it. Luckily they have spinraza royalties and R&D agreements to fund these efforts and support further developments in their platform without diluting shares to support this. If waylivra and tegsedi weren't such busts (IMO) this stock would likely be trading in the low 70's but that's about it for now. tegsedi and waylivra were suppose to carry them through this period but it didn't pan out. That's why this stock is stuck. until we get some readouts (Huntington's, ALS in 2021 and beyond) the stock will likely stay range bound. If the stock moves sell some, let it settle and buy back or put it elsewhere. Pipelines are no guarantee for success. Take waylivra, if they would have developed that without a partner initially, that cost would have put ionis in a worse position moving forward (by the way, it is not being refiled in US until 2021 now). So if you're really still invested in ionis in hopes of a buyout I suggest you look to phase out of your position on upward moves. They are moving out with a more aggressive business model that will take more time, cost more money, and create greater risk. But, if successful, will allow for greater valuations when these early stage, fully owned, ionis drugs hopefully make their way towards commercialization. In the meantime sell the moves because this will take time and money for this new effort to bare fruit. GLTY"
"Please go to StockTwits and see CPKC's ""Link to yesterday's presentation"". I posted the link here twice but both got sacked for some reason. I have reviewed the slides twice, truly important data for investors in Ionis/Akcea."
"In my latest message I detailed why I put my money in IONS, not Alnylam. I do not wish to imply anything more to others because I may be wrong. As thrilling as it was to see the Huntington's study results, we are yet to hear far reaching breakthrough medical news, one after another, in the coming months and years. IONS's subsidiary Akcea is awaiting decisions on volanesorsen from FDA, EMA and Canada. Canada is expected to make a decison in late spring, FDA avdisory panel, most likely in June, PDUFA date is on August 30, 2018. EMA decision should be around middle of the year or may be later. Clock is ticking. At this time no one knows whether it will be approved or not. If it is approved sometime down the road, medical community will examine its clinical implications closely. Initially, it will be used only for Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) (Akcea exclusive, no partner) but over time target population is expected to reach 25 million minimum (Novartis estimation). Volanesorsen is not like Lipitor (atorvastatin), until recently almost all drugs targeted symptoms or pathophysiology at best. Volanesorsen is targeting etiology. Hypertriglyceridemia's link to atherosclerosis is now scientifically proven and volanesorsen treats this condition like a miracle drug. Also, until now, a lot of guess work was involved in assessing clinical diagnosses. Beauty of IONS's science is that a precise diagnosis is made first through a lab test, a specific target genetic abnormality confirms the diagnosis and an IONS's drug goes after the root cause (etiology) of the disease, an example would be disabling the gene that produces an abnormal protein that causes the disease. The drug nullifies this gene's actions. If a drug attacks the cause of a disease (not symptoms, not pathology) patients improve much faster and much more, almost like cure (until DNA treatment comes along it is difficult to use the word cure). So, medically speaking we are entering into a new world. Now, enter IONS/Bayer collaboration world, IONS has IONIS-FXIrx, FXI or factor eleven is a clotting factor, a high level causes heart attack, stroke and venous thrombosis but a low level does not lead to bleeding tendency. FXIrx brings FXI level down. Until now doctors have been treading on thin ice, too much anticlotting drug caused bleeding and death, too little caused thrombosis and death (stent, stroke patients etc). IONIS-FXIrx dramatically reduces the level of FXI so it blocks clotting but does not lead to bleeding even if FXI level is low (not involved in bleeding mechanism). If this is not a miracle discovery I do not know what is. Bayer recently called it a ""Holy Grail"" discovery. Forty drugs are lined up, so if IONS stock drops a little or drops a lot, it will only bring in more buyers, institutions are accumulating this stock."
Interesting results.https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1900907?query=featured_home
"I’ve been reading some articles about the drug developed by Roche and Ionis. There is a huge excitement about the recent results of a trial because of the frequency of lumbar punctures. Instead of injecting patients one a month, doctors’ll inject the drug every four - six months. But they also say in the letter that lowering the Huntingtin protein isn’t still a proof that the drug in fact works treating the disease effectively. As far as I know researchers try to prove the hypothesis that reducing levels of huntingtin will cure the disease. I would like to know your opinions about that."
I have a question for anyone who knows about Zolgensma. Novartis will more than likely get approval this May for their SMA drug. Zolgensma is a one time treatment that supposedly cures SMA and patients never need another treatment. The cost could range from 2 million to 4 million a treatment. If true it could render Spinraza obsolete. I just heard of Zolgensma yesterday. Wells if you read this post can you comment.
I look at the posts here and laugh for I. Probably have more biotech experience than anybody on this board I owe this experience to be old. Just turned 82. Have bought sold traded all kinds of biotech stock. I have had winners losers and have made all kinds of mistakes. I bought 1000 shares of Amgen in 1988 at 22 dollars a share. Big mistake number 1 was the search for the next Amgen. If I just kept what I had I would be somewhere north of 5 mil. But I had days where I went down 50 grand in a day and also had stockbrokers keep telling me I needed to be more rounded and less overweighted so I sold a lot of Amgen and bought inferior stocks. They all sounded great but the plant biotech had a flaw and was bought out for peanuts. I bought biogen in single digits but they hit a slow stretch and I sold biogen for inferior stocks and biogen got their groove back and became a huge success. I owned icons in single digits. They had a great ED drug but never did too much with it. And were raped by Lily who made a killing on that productI bought isis now Ionis at 3-4 dollars a share. Not a bad return where it is now except I have owned it for 30 yearsTheir science is great but either the product didn’t work or biogen took the lions share. Hard to be bullish but with their science cash and number of products in the pipeline I am a very strong neutral is alnylam that much better a company to be in the 100s. I don’t think so. So I will be patient for a while longer and if any of you want a welcome ear to listen to your stock sitting still for 5 years I will be happy to compare notes
Stock seems to act as if it will be purchased by a major player.....The run up has been consistent and the growth potentials seems quite positive.

"I listened to Brett Monia’s first presentation and his responses to the post presentation questions. We have a true star! Time will prove it. Successfully developing highly potent drugs with negligible side effects to challenge impossible diseases like cystic fibrosis, bronchial asthma, obstructive pulmonary diseases are not my fantasy but a reality, Dr. Monia mentioned as part of an answer to a question. Monia also mentioned that Ionis has solved delivery problems to pancreatic beta cells and said this would allow the company to challenge diseases like diabetes. Remember, these are not rare diseases. Also, Ionis drugs are not like ordinary drugs, Ionis drug are far, far more effective because they are RNA rooted drugs. Monia also mentioned about Akcea and the status of Waylivra in terms of its current FDA status. In my previous message I briefly touched on this subject. Monia said that Waylivra is Akcea’s #1 priority. Monia mentioned dyslipidemia study and open label study data, all positive in terms of safety profile. Monia also said that FCS community has been pushing FDA too. All in all, my prediction is that we will here a registration news from FDA not far down the road. Monia also detailed about other Akcea’s exciting projects. Brett Monia is a born American scientist and entrepreneur. Future stock price will prove it."
"I've been a long-term holder now for 5-6 years. I heard repeatedly during the first half of 2020 that ""the second half of 2020 was when IONS would finally be rewarded!"" Well, we're almost halfway through the second half, and I'm still not seeing it. I'm going to give it until the end of this year. If we're not in the $70s, I'll move my money to a company that actually gives a carp about its share-owners.There's always another ""right around the corner"" with this company. Unless they actually put a concerted effort into backstopping the stock price (dividend, threat of buyout, etc.) and giving investors a reason to pay up to own shares, it'll just keep floundering within its unrealized potential. At some point, you just have to draw a line and move on.One of the worst investments I've made, and it shouldn't be. So what's the next ""right around the corner"" that I should be waiting for?"
Great article from IBD below in the news section of the IONS Yahoo Quote page. The article highlights what us Bulls on IONS have been posting for a couple years now. IONS is now ranked 8th out of the 500 Bio Stocks and has an RSR of 97 and a Composite rating of 94. IONS's earnings report absolutely BLEW AWAY estimates ( yes much of it was one time gains ) BUT there's much more to follow IMO. The best news is that IONS's Huntington's Disease drug could be approved in the next 12 months as could Wayliva. I thought the HD Drug was farther out than that. IONS is now a Leader in the Biotech Sector and as I posted many times IMO will be one of the best investments over the next 10 years. Finally IONS is getting the well deserved recognition it deserves. Over the next 3 years IMO IONS will have 3 to 4 new drugs on the market and a stock price of $200 to $250 a share. Where is GS now? Where are all the Bears on IONS that said Antisense was not a viable platform??? They have all gone into permanent hibernation.
"I have been researching the prevalence of Huntington's Disease globally. I am breaking it down country by country. Huntington's Disease is more prevalent than I knew. Now the statistics vary on which source I referenced. In the U.S. HD Prevalence from one source is 4 to 5 cases per 100,000 ppl. So I calculated 14,625 U.S. cases. In the EU HD is more prevalent at 4 to 7 cases per 100,000 ppl. Asia has a very low prevalence at .40 per million ppl. Now a few sources stated 30,000 U.S cases. So Globally there could be over 500,000 cases ( again numbers vary with different sources. ) Bottom line is IONS's HD drug if approved will be a Multi Billion dollar blockbuster. Take the lower number from the one reference I looked up. I calculated 14,625 HD cases on a U.S Population of 325 million citizens. At a guess of 150,000 per dose that's over 2 Billion just in the U.S. At 30,000 cases in the U.S. that's 4.5 Billion in sales. Now I have no clue what will be charged per dose it could be lower or higher. But my point is this HD drug is the only one that will be available if approved as far as I know. Globally the numbers and potential revenue are huge. This could be one of the reasons IONS is starting to perform so well. I read recently that Roche seek approval in a year or so. IONS Royalty agreement on the HD drug is around 20% I think ( someone correct me if I'm wrong ) So with some simple math you can see IONS cut on global sales will be enormous for a company with a current 11 billion market cap."
"Tofersen results to be presented this Sunday at 4:20pm Eastern, according to the PR. Only 3 more days to wait. This should be a big topic of conversation at Biogen’s earnings call this coming Wednesday. This will not be a blockbuster drug due to the small patient population, which I believe is about 1,400 in the G7 nations. However, it may serve as a proof of concept for the other Biogen/Ionis ALS drugs and even the entire Ionis neuro platform to some extent."
"Look like Ionis/Roche Huntington's ASO work. Since all patients participating in this phase III trial receive the highest dose (120mg), the effect should be observed sooner than the published phase i/ii which had 4 dosing levels, with only 8 patients receiving 120 mg the highest for couple months only: https://www.inforum.com/lifestyle/health/4638953-Fargo-native-with-Huntingtons-takes-part-in-clinical-trial-to-treat-neurological-condition"

"more great news from spiranza: -Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced new interim Phase 2 results from NURTURE, the ongoing open-label, single-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA (nusinersen) among pre-symptomatic infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In NURTURE, all infants treated with SPINRAZA were alive, did not require permanent ventilation and showed improvement in motor function and motor milestone achievements as of July 5, 2017, compared to the disease’s natural history. This study, along with a case series demonstrating SPINRAZA’s effectiveness among teens and young adults, will be presented at the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical Conference on March 11-14, 2018, in Arlington, Virginia.“These results reinforce SPINRAZA’s effectiveness as the first and only approved treatment for SMA and demonstrate once again the benefit it can bring to individuals with SMA, including infants, teens and young adults,” said Alfred Sandrock, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen. “SPINRAZA is supported by the largest well-controlled SMA clinical development program conducted to date and we are committed to ongoing research in SMA. Biogen looks forward to working with healthcare providers and institutions in order to provide teens and young adults with SMA access to SPINRAZA, a treatment that has demonstrated significant benefit in the maintenance of motor function for these patients.”"
"For those who mock and criticize Dr. Crooke, IONS's management and strategy I say you are very short sighted and uninformed. IONS will soon have IMO 3 approved drugs that IONS developed. IONS will receive a revenue stream from all 3. 45 or so drugs are in the pipeline, I know of ones in development that are very promising with an efficacy and safety profile that are very promising. Ive posted on them before. IONS is now where companies like GILD and CELG were just before they exploded to the upside. I own shares of XON which is half what I paid for it a couple years ago. Reason being they almost ran out of cash befotre their incredible products made enough revenue and profit to keep XON a viable solvent company. So IONS;s strategy of partnering is a business model that is not only working but will ensure they survive to become a powerhouse profit machine and much larger drug company. Also calculate what 75% of AKCA is worth. How about 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS. Not bad for a spinoff from IONS not very long ago. Maybe some day IONS will spin off that 75% of AKCA to IONS shareholders. If they don't though it still is a valuable asset on the balance sheet. But don't forget IONS's management owns a lot of IONS shares, so if they spin off AKCA some day to shareholders of IONS they stand to reap a HUGE windfall. I could go on and on with many more positives but won't. Just one more point. IONS is profitable far ahead of schedule, and their profits will only grow and the years go by."
"IONS will have 10 drugs in Phase 3 Clinical Trials by the end of 2020. That's from Dr. Stanley Crooke. These blips up and down on a daily, weekly, monthly basis are meaningless if your in this stock for the next 3, 5, 10 years. IONS IMO will be one of the best performing stocks in the next 10 years in the Biotech Sector, if not the best."
"CARLSBAD, Calif., Feb. 11, 2020 Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the leader in RNA-targeted therapeutics, announced today that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted orphan drug designation to ION373 for the treatment of people with Alexander disease"
"Tofersen works. The data very consistently shows there was a benefit across all measures and Tofersen was lowering SOD-1 significantly. There was an imbalance in baseline neurofilament levels favoring placebo. Dr Miller showed the baseline neurofilament levels were highly correlated with clinical outcome. The study should have stratified by this measure in the study design. It's a simpler and maybe better measure of severity of disease than speed of progression. The study was clearly too short. The study team was pressured to limit the time on placebo treatment. 28 weeks was not enough. Based on the OLE, they should have followed for 40 weeks. It's a shame that Dr. Miller used the wrong presentation and didn't talk enough about the benefit of more time on drug that was shown by the OLE portion of the study. Depending on how they calculated the 95% CIs, it looks like a pooled 95% CI across baseline progression groups would have shown a significant separation between treatment and placebo at 40 weeks. But the post-hoc nature limits the inference that can be made. Given the Aduhelm controversy, it's going to be hard to make a case based on the totality of the data. The data is not mature yet. Some patients haven't made it through all of the relevant measurement periods. The best course is to provide an update next year with more mature data and be patient. Sad."
"I could not believe this went up o0nly 6% for positive blowout results for phase 2 trial of HAE drug, folks, this is a rare disease, and trial is normally done on a very small patient population. 20 patients are considered a big trial for this type of disease as there is not a big patient volume. That being said, HAE drugs are normally very costly, the most expensive drugs in the world are rare disease drugs, go to google and check for yourself. IONS reporting positive results for phase II means this is a blockbuster potential asset, Wall Street analysts are not doing their job, very poor publicity for such an awesome milestone, this should go up from here!"
"I listened to the investor conference today. In a nutshell, my impression was that Ionis is doing great, but the stock price will not go up significantly for another year or so. Following are my impressions from the Investor Day presentation.Ionis says it has the ""potential"" to have 20 drugs on the market in the next five years. Twelve of those will be Ionis owned drugs. Eight will be with partners. Five of those drugs (two Ionis owned) will have multi-billion dollar opportunities according to Ionis presenters. I don't know if that means the drugs might make billions over their lifetime or annually. In any event, a presenter stressed that royalties go up to the low 20% range, and all royalties are 100% profit (since I guess the partner pays all expenses, not to mention milestone payments).Lica (targeted delivery) and the oral delivery route for drugs was discussed a lot. One presenter said Ionis is positioned for substantial and sustained growth. Catalysts in 2011 include two or more drugs progressing to phase 3 (six already in phase 3), four (or more) new mid-stage studies will begin, fifteen new study readouts or study initiations. That leads me to believe we should have fifteen press releases in 2021, which hopefully will be positive. Ionis expects twelve (plus) drugs in phase 3 and twelve (plus) drugs ""commercialized"" by 2026. In my second paragraph above I said Ionis has the potential to have 20 drugs in the next five years. I think the difference might be that they expect to see 12 drugs, but potentially could have 20. Anyone correct me if I am mistaken. I believe one presenter said Ionis ""conservatively expects to have twelve new drugs by 2026."" The next drug is expected to hit the market in 2022. After that, I guess they must expect to be cranking them out relatively quickly. They have three now, one more in 2022, which means eight more should be going to market from 2022 till 2026 (if they get to twelve as they stated). Eight in that four year span would be dramatic. Also, if they have twelve drugs in phase 3 in 2026 (as they mentioned), those should be on the market soon after 2026.There was some mention of work in the genetics field, but they did not elaborate. I think it had something to do with finding targets. It seems like Ionis has no shortage of drug candidates, and they often have multiple targets for the same drug.As I previously stated, I think Ionis is a great company, but the timing for a stock purchase in my opinion is still too early. The catalysts next year (2021) include advancing stages of many drug programs, but no new drugs. Maybe a bunch of milestone payments from partners in the blockbuster drugs (three in stage 3) and lesser drugs will help move the stock price in 2021. I intend to continue following the stock. When they come closer to delivering the drugs (maybe a year from now), I will probably invest a lot more in Ionis.Any comments or corrections? I suggest you visit Ionis' website and review the slideshow that goes with the presentation."
"I’m glad I moved out of this stock and into INO. I once thought IONS would take the lead in RNA medicine and they might yet, but DNA medicine is the future. RNA medicines will have their place but the much less expensive DNA medicines with a much better safety profile will eventually have the largest market share for cancers and infectious diseases, as well as diseases caused by aberrant proteins. Good luck."
"According to 12/26/2019 Wall Street Journal's Business & Finance Section, page B12, approximately 6 out of 100 drugs entering human trials reaches Phase 3. IONIS predicted to have 10 Phase 3 drugs by end of 2020, with 4 in Phase 3 on this date. These numbers seem like over 50% and definitely a designer drug company to me."

"bullish blog from dirk on ionsOnly Ionis Pharmaceuticals in-playAccording to the above, only Alnylam and Ionis Pharmaceuticals with multiple important drug candidates about to be approved over the next 3-4 years would fulfill the requirement for adding needle-moving near-term revenue growth to a large acquirer. With a $13B market cap already and a power-hungry management to build the most successful biotech company in history, I do not see large companies ultimately offering the ~$40B it would likely take for a successful bid for the company.By contrast, Ionis Pharmaceuticals with a market cap of $6B and a likely more robust stream of oligo drugs hitting the market (Spinraza for SMA last year, Inotersen for TTR amyloidosis and an ApoCIII-lowering drug this year alone) appears to me a more realistic target despite its history of engaging in multiple partnerships with a number of large pharmaceutical companies, partly in an effort to make it a less appealing takeover target.The likely acquirer would be Biogen, of course. When Ionis and Biogen initially partnered to address in early 2012 on what has become the SPINRAZA blockbuster, Biogen quickly learned how powerful and widely applicable antisense technology could be for addressing CNS disorders. In less than 2 years, the companies would sign another 3 partnerships ultimately covering numerous targets in the CNS which is where Biogen has gone on to firmly stake its future on. As we know today, giving away so fast so much of the upside to the CNS franchise was a mistake on Ionis' part as the CNS has emerged as the area of highest value to the current antisense platform full-stop. SMA was only the beginning and diseases like Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, ALS- you name the neurological disorder- suddenly seem within targeting reach.Still, adding up the royalty payments and milestone payments for such licensed products would add up quite a bit. In fact, SPINRAZA payments alone would justify Ionis' current market cap as it is growing into a multi-billion annual revenue drug and cornerstone to Biogen's SMA franchise.Because other Ionis-licensed CNS product candidates would also address the root causes of diseases, they would similarly lend themselves to become cornerstones in new CNS franchises that Biogen is targeting, e.g. ALS.So when Biogen’s CEO calls M&A valuations being reasonable and not over-stretched as frequently asserted by his colleagues and then goes on to mention recent CNS breakthroughs in SMA (à Spinraza), Huntington’s (watch out for knockdown data from phase I/IIa late Feb/early March), migraine, and multiple sclerosis, I cannot shake the feeling that Ionis will be the target of the big M&A move that everybody is expecting Biogen to make. $20B and we have a deal. it could mean that the company that tried its best in the oligo space not to be an M&A target, Ionis, could be one of the next to be acquired."
"great earnings beat, raise guidance, authorized 125M in share repurchase with ability to expand, and stock does the inverted hammer on the daily chart. Suspect maybe some downward action today that makes no sense, but appears possible on the daily chart. However, will be buyer on weakness here as the risk/reward highly favors upside and looking for possible hammer on the daily action today to wash out and show reversal pattern. GLTAL"

"Broken stock, but not a broken company in my opinion. Pipeline is strong, free cash flow positive with more licensing revenue coming in along with other partnership payments. Yes, the stock is broken but I believe there's enough positives in the business that will ultimate fix the 'stock'. Irrationality on the downside will ultimately lead to the same on the upside. Good luck Ioinis longs..."
"It is nice to see this stock doing well. This proves that, in the end, good science and sound management wins. It is our responsibility to supporta a company like Ionis."
What is going on?
"Today we received some visibility into their pre-clinical pipeline. 18 medicines expected to enter the clinic within 18 months. 8 currently without partners (IONIS wholly owned), 4 for Biogen, 2 for AstraZeneca, & 4 others with other partners."
"In real world, especially within pharmaceutical industry, exclusivity is crucial. Any one who missed Dr. Crooke's presentation should read the printed version word by word. Ionis now has drugs that work like old day antibiotics except that, believe it or not, these drugs are not causing deadly side effects, something medicine has never seen before. In studies, LICA drugs fared better than placebo! In the old days, when a company came up with a new drug, me too drugs followed very quickly, allergy drugs, pain medicines (ibuprofen), antiacids and more. When a serotonin reuptake blocker was shown to be effective in obsessive disorder, a half dozen drug companies came up with me too drugs for the 2 million patient population! Dr. Crooke said yesterday that LP(a) drug alone has 8 million target population!! Most recently, Acadia Pharma came up with pimavanserin, a breathrough drug but Sunovion came up with a copycat. There are many RNA drug companies but Dr. Crooke said others cannot match the depth of science Ionis has achieved over the years. Exclusivity, in the end, is the name of the game. Currently, there is no LP(a) level lowering drug under investigation or under development. Same with APOCIII and the rest. Ionis scientists are now asking ""Who are the real alchemists?"" They have created pills that medicine has never seen before. World still has no clue, in fact, scientists have been telling Dr. Crooke to stop his work and do something else. No far down the road, world will see how a dying person turn alive and cite Biblical quotations."

"I am obviously surprised at the FDA's rejection of Waylivra. I will be very interested in what the EU or EC and also Japan and Canada decide. Remember that Inotersen( also an IONS AKCA drug for another disease ) was already approved by the European Commission. Inotersen also has some adverse side effects but common sense applied in the EC's decision. If I have a debilitating painful disease I would want to at least have the option to try a drug that could relieve my horrible condition. Now Inotersen has competition so the EC could have said no and waited for other drugs from other companies. BUT Volanesorsen aka Waylivra has no competition which makes the FDA's decision even more baffling. Platelet drop due to Volanesorsen can be monitored and the treatment stopped. Same with injection site reactions. I repeat NO other drug available for this condition. I can just imagine how disapointed the people with this horrible condition feel today after having some hope, only to be crushed."

"Great anticipation for P3 test results on 1st ALS drug in IONIS pipeline … expected this quarter, possibly this month. ALS is believed to have several different causes. IONIS has 4 ALS drugs in their pipeline … Biogen is running the test phases on first 3 IONIS ALS drugs."

"Novartis AG's top executive said on Wednesday it expects to price its gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy “far lower” than the $4 million to $5 million figure the Swiss drugmaker has said it could be worth.U.S. regulators are expected to make a decision this month on whether to approve Zolgensma, a one-time therapy seen as a potential long-term solution for the rare disease that is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. The company has previously said it could price the treatment in a range of $1.5 million to $5 million.“We won’t be announcing the price until we get the approval. But our overall goal is to be at a fraction of what is the current standard of care, and the current standard of care for treating these patients is $4 million to $5 million over 10 years,”"
"Relatively speaking Ionis stock has performed exceptionally well in recent months. Nine months ago Alnylam stock price was nearly three times higher than Ionis stock (120 to 45). At that time I wrote detailed reasons why Ionis stock would perform far better in the ensuing months. That prediction has turned to a reality today (Ionis 67 as of this writing vs. Alny 66.44), I am fully aware that Alnylam is a great company and over time they should be able to address drug delivery issues but my complaint was that Ionis was savagely under valued. Stock price go up and down so I am not jumping up and down but Ionis stock owners will see their share value compounding in rain and shine."
"Couple years ago, Goldman rated IONS at $25, not sure if they have changed their opinion, I am not a fan of analysts, commentators etc, win or lose I wager my own money. Richard was also endlessly critical about IONS, he had done enough RNA research to know that antisense was a failed research but he was stuck at old RNA failed antisense research and refused to accept Ionis’s breakthrough discoveries, he too insisted that IONS was way over priced. Internet is the God given gift, I can study most anything these days, we can tease out wheat from chaff. Still some young investors can be misled by these people. As I have said numerous times (based on my presented scientific facts) IONS stock has only begun to show its true prowess, institutions are swarming in, check it out, this is not just another promising biotech stock, this company has pioneered a new frontier in medicine that all others have tried but gave up, Merck, Gilead and countless others. Treatment revolution is underway, from symptom based treatment, from pathophysiology based treatment to etiology based treatment, we are still in the dawn. Game is just beginning to be played out, don’t rush, don’t try to make few dollars here and there, act like Mike, I believe Mike will be a rich retiree."
"I believe we got two really bad news recently. 1) RG6042 clinicals trial result was delayed and Roche decided to add participants in the study. This usually meant the result is not good. 2) Biogen submitted their Alzheimer's drug (Aducanumab) for FDA approval. With their own Alzheimer drug approved, what is the incentive for Biogen to speed up with IONIS-MAPT-Rx clinical trials where they have to pay royalty to IONS? Again, this is only my take on it. Having said that, I am still long on IONS."
"There is a time to be born, time to die. For IONS it is a time to harvest. Price may rise rapidly, may rise slowly but it will rise. Like or not, this company is to announce groud breaking discovery news one after another and this will happen on top of three approved drugs generating compounding sales growth. Many have been totally disillusioned on this stock but eventual reward will be worthy of their wait."

"Since Ionis stock formed a grand scale inverse head & shoulder chart pattern in 2016, Ionis stock has been, with ups and downs, in an up trend. At the bottom of H&S, price was $20. Most recently, I mentioned “Ionis stock has a long journey to traverse crossing $200 mark and much higher”, here it will be literally “Time is money”. Market is not simple, so we still have to guard ourselves against overall market trend, political risks etc but Ionis and Akcea will stand out above all because Ionis has discovered drugs that treat etiologies of diseases, the first in the history of medicine, and the LICA drugs are practically side effect free or show only negligible risks, again never seen in medicine before, in most cases drugs that treat deadly diseases cause deadly side effects but LICA drugs have eliminated these! Market won’t ignore these facts, these are truly brilliant scientists, finally we got rid of doubters and “I know better” crowd. We still need a lot of patience.,"
"From the Quarterly results, Brett P. Monia, Ph.D., chief operating officer and senior vice president of antisense drug discovery and translational medicine at Ionis Pharmaceuticals. ""Looking ahead, we plan to pursue only those partnerships with infrastructure and resources that complement our own. Simultaneously, we plan to continue to build our wholly owned pipeline of drugs to treat patients with rare and serious diseases.""Finally, an answer to what i have been complaining about. They're going to build a wholly owned pipeline, instead of partnering every drug they produce. That is a significant change to the business model, and one that is necessary for them to reach their true potential as a company. I wish they had done that earlier, -i guess they feel this is the right time in terms of their technological progression and financial position."
"a quiet board afer the results. i am not too surprised by them. there were cases that appeared to show the drug working -they may have gotten the placebo or not. their cases could have been outliers and the disease progressed more slowly for them. as for the fal in share values, it is disproportionate to the pipeline potential. i am holding onto my shares. i may even buy a little more .."
Today me and kathy woods will make money ..
slow bleed continues until the pipeline is discounted to Nil' and we trade at cash value. sell the company to people that understand how to measure risk/reward.
"Akcea Therapeutics and Ionis Pharma (IONS) announce results from a Phase 2 study evaluating AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and elevated levels of lipoproteinBriefing.comJanuary 02, 2020 08:02 AM ETFollowing treatment, patients experienced significant dose-dependent reductions in Lp(a) at all dose levels studied with up to an 80% reduction in Lp(a) at the highest cumulative dose regimen (equivalent to 80 mg monthly). Approximately 98% of patients at the 80 mg monthly dose regimen achieved Lp(a) levels below 125 nmol/L (~50 mg/dL). Significant dose-dependent reductions in LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB and OxPL-apo(a) from baseline were also observed. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, with the most frequent adverse events being injection site reactions (ISRs). ISRs occurred in 27% and 6% of patients on treatment and those on placebo, respectively, and were mostly mild. One patient discontinued treatment due to an ISR. There were no differences in platelet counts, liver and renal parameters, or flu-like symptoms in patients administered AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.and ions is down?"
"well, they were able to affect their target but it did not lead to large enough clinical benefit. these diseases are complicated. interesting that they are giving it away to patients free. i guess with no treatment options the hope is patients will scream for it to be approved. i somehow doubt it though. even without the ALS franchise the company is still pretty cheap. there are other drugs for much larger patient populations in the pipe."

"Clinical trials are not like a simple lab test in which confounding variables are under control. Human biological system is extremely complex, there are many confounding variables in clinical trials, initial morbidity of enrolled patients is important, when a pool of patients are sicker at the time of enrollment, treatment outcome is not same as when not as sick patients are enrolled initially, this happens in any clinical trail but this is especially so in rare disease and even in DNA, RNA related studies. In a given geographic location, if an investigator seeks study subjects, there are only a limited number of patients available to enroll, usually the sickest patients are enrolled in the first trial, in the second clinical trial less sick patients are recruited etc, this affects trial outcome. People mention lower transthyretin level in the patisiciran study, this again has to be interpreted based on the first visit average transthyretin level differences between the two studies. Duration of the study is also important, in patisiran study duration of the study was extended to 18 months while inotersen study patients received study drug for 15 months. By far the most important confounding variable in the two studies is use of dexamethasone (Decadron) in the patisiran study, a powerful and dangerous drug if a high dose is used for a sutained period of time, dexamethasone brings out sense of well being, cure all type of drug in medicine, it is also known as a risky drug in medicine because it is, until inotersen is given with dexamethasone for the same duration of time (18 months) it is difficult to compare the two study results. In the case of RNA drugs, drug absorption into cytoplasm is a huge issue because of cell membraine polarity issue and IONS drugs have huge advantage here (IONS drugs are single-stranded RNA, ALNY drugs are double-stranded RNA), if dexemethasone use has anything to do with this issue this is a huge confounding variable if anyone is comparing the study outcomes between the two studies. If dexamethasone is used there is huge difference in sense of well being so any improvement scale measures this part of illness improvement this will be the worst confounding variable between the two studies because inotersen patients were not given dexamethasone (inotersen patients were not exposed to the risks associated with use of dexamethasone either). Inotersen will be replaced with Lrx version not far down the road so other side effects like skin reactions and platelet count will not be an issue down the road. Overall and in due time course, patients, doctors and investors will decide the relative value of the two companies, ALNY uses nature's way of handing biological processes and IONS uses tweeked method, that is, a short strand of RNA goes through chemecal changes to ack like RNAi (ALNY method), RNAi drugs (double-stranded RNA) have huge delivery problem to various tissues in human body especially in human brain."
"I can""t believe AKCA didn't rally on the news that the EMA approved Wayliva. I bought another Lot for another trade at $32.42 this morning. If final approval comes ( which I think will ) AKCA should pass $40 IMO. If I didn't own so much IONS already I would buy more IONS too."
"just to add some reality to this board. Crooke sold 10% of this company to Biogen at 54.34 a share (not 90) in June 2018, (not 2016). approximately an 8B market cap. who knows more about fair value for IONS? crooke and BIIB or people posting on this board? @115 this stock would have a 16B market cap, no way they would even be offered that but at least that number would be optimistically more realistic. so @72 this trades at 10B market cap while generating less than 1B annual rev. I'm long and believe this company has a lot going for it but at current valuation the market is factoring in much of its near term upside value. full disclosure I sold some today at 68.75. GLTA"
give us a new CEO/Chairman and then may shares will rally.
"I wish Ions best of luck, looking forward to improving more people lives. I believe IONS is very undervalued based on assets and available equity."

"I listened to the conference call. Following are my personal observations.The acquisition of Akcea will allow Ionis to benefit by using Akcea's commercial capabilities to get wholly owned Ionis products to market sooner and more profitably.Five ongoing phase 3 studies are progressing well, and a sixth is expected to start later this year. Ionis expects to present at least ten drugs for marketing applications (which I believe means requests for approval) in the next five years. Ionis showed a slide with eighteen drugs that are nearing the approval stage. I inferred from this that in the best case scenario they might have those eighteen drugs up for approval in the next five years. Several mentions of the drug delivery methods improving, which improves the effectiveness of drugs. A lot of catalysts in late 2020 and in 2021. I suggest that you review the slides from the conference call for specifics.They often referred to the virtual investor day (Dec. 7). I inferred from this that they have a lot to present on 12-7-20. I noticed that there were a lot of questions from a lot of analysts (compared to the past two conferences) during the Q & A. I think that showed a lot more interest than in the recent past. Ionis has a lot of cash (almost $2 billion). Spinraza alone generated $74 million in the third quarter. Ionis had $65 million in R&D in the third quarter, and they expect a substantial increase in the fourth quarter (they already received $75 million). Ionis expects to be ""meaningfully profitable"" in 2020.There were several mentions of advancing the Ionis owned pipeline (which I believe on average will be more profitable than drugs that are marketed by other companies).There was a lot of discussion of many (very many) individual drugs in the pipeline that are progressing well. I believe many of the existing drugs are being tested for additional illnesses. The beauty of this is that most of those drugs have already been tested for safety, so the approval process is shortened greatly. One drug is being tested in Brazil for Covid related issues. I am no expert, but the pipeline is so much greater than any other company I am familiar with.My personal opinion is that Ionis is greatly undervalued. They have money in the bank, they are not bleeding money, they have three successful drugs on the market, they have over forty drugs in the pipeline, etc. I am ""hoping"" that whatever is presented at the investor conference on 12-7-20 will give the stock a big boost. Any criticism of this post is appreciated."
"I think most analysts are fixated and blinded by the Spinraza competition treat and therefore have a hold on stock, I think if Spinraza did not exist this stock would have been higher, look at balance sheet, no cash burn, no stock offering to finance 38 product pipeline, efficient RD platform. I think no mater how the competition develops in Spinraza, good or bad once the event is here and past, stock will take off. Today the collaborator dosed first patient in Huntington disease and paid ions $35 Million for the privilege. Stock is a long term hold."
"Let me get this right, Biogen & Ionis ""report positive topline clinical data on investigational Alzheimer's disease treatment at AAIC"" and IONS stock drops after hours. Go figure!"
Update Oct. 10 Wells Fargo maintains outperform with price target at $110https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ions/ratings
"I am curious as to why Alnylam carries so much higher market cap vs. Ionis. In most cases, market finds out the the fair value far better than any individual oppinion etc. RNA research has a unique yet not uncommon background, scientists had insurmountable barriers that lasted a good couple of decades. Who opened the flood gate? Andrew Fire and Robert Mellow, ""In 1998, the American scientists Andrew Fire and Craig Mello published their discovery of a mechanism that can degrade mRNA from a specific gene. This mechanism, RNA interference, is activated when RNA molecules occur as double-stranded pairs in the cell. Double-stranded RNA activates biochemical machinery which degrades those mRNA molecules that carry a genetic code identical to that of the double-stranded RNA. When such mRNA molecules disappear, the corresponding gene is silenced and no protein of the encoded type is made."" This scientist, Robert Meller, a 2006 Nobel laureate is with Alnylam along with Phillip Sharp who shared Nobel Prize with Richard Robers for their discovery of RNA splicing in 1993. Sharp is a co-founder of Alnylam. With these two towering figures Alnylam's reputations became beyond dispute. Here I am self conscious that I am revealing private information, when my daughter with education from a top Ivy league school, M.D., Ph.D., had done RNA research herself found out that I had plundered my money into Ionis stock she told me ""Dad, a stock to buy is Alnylam, they have better science."" I bow down to my daughter in almost all cases but I was putting in my own money, I had to do some due deligence myself. Incidentally, this was 5 years ago, I paid $8.75 for Ionis stock, it kept rising and reached $60 in little over a year, of course I jumped out before the peak, here I made a lot of money. When I did a background check my finding was different. Mellow did his work on worms, here everything worked out fine. RNA is different from ordinary drugs that work outside of the cell membrance but RNA stays inside cells and RNA drugs have to cross the cell membrane to reach cytoplasm and interact with RNAs. Human cell membrane is not same as worm cell membrance, Alnylam has had difficulties to have their durgs cross human cell membraine. This is happening, in part, because double-stranded RNA has polarity issues. Alnylam has been battling this issue from day one and continues to work on this issue to this date. Ionis, on the other hand, had found ways to make chemically modified single-stranded RNA work like double-stranded RNA yet because this one is single-stranded it is far superior in terms of delivery of drugs to cytoplasm. Result is obvious, look at the clinical trial programs at Ionis vs. Alnylam, look at how many Alnylam drugs are in clinical trials for brain diseases, none, Ionis, on the other hand, is going after Huntington's chorea, Amyotraphic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy and more. My mom used to say ""You can't live on prestige"", time to wake up and be real."
So much for the post earnings bump. Now we can get back to normal and extend our trend to 5 losing days in 6 sessions. Great expectations.
"They have 40 drugs in the Pipeline, but there is no single important news about these in 2020. I think it's a world record :)."
"Recently I mentioned that attempt to treat Alzheimer's disease through prevention of amyloid plaque build up in the brain have failed repeatedly, major clinical trials by Pfizer, Eli Lilly failed, today Biogen stock tanked after uncuccessful amyloid clinical trial results. Tau is more closely linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease than amyloid plaque (from IONS website). The three internet links below describe and explain the basic science research data that support the rationale to conduct tau clinical trials instead of amyloid plaque. A clinical trial is currently underway by Biogen/IONS (http://www.ionispharma.com/pipeline/, click on ""Alzheimer disease""). This study uses IONS's IONS-MAPTrx, in this study drug is administered intrathecally to spinal space once a month, previously I have stressed how important this study is because there is no other drug that is as promising as this one, its not that other companies are not trying, only IONIS has successfully developed a molecule that can be delivered to the brain and penetrate through the brain cell (neuron) membraine so that the drug can disable target RNA (tau producing RNAs are located inside brain cells, not outside):http://ir.ionispharma.com/static-files/4ab8c591-c51b-45e1-8b0d-ef83a46c0853https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792300/https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170125/Synthetic-molecule-appears-to-reverse-Alzheimers-related-neurological-damage.aspx(last link from StockTwits, Howie R)."
"I'm hoping to see this push down to ~54.75 today or Monday then move toward 58ish by earnings. not expecting much from earnings but the call should at least make those that own the stock feel better. I'm curious to know what Stanley plans to do with the 2B+ cash pile he's sitting on. I doubt we get anything on that front besides furthering the science but the board should find additional use or give some back as a one time dividend. He gave shareholders nothing with the AKCA spinoff. He should be pressed for a plan on capital use. hoarding money for a rainy day is not a plan. maybe once he retires they loosen up. go big or sell out, but it's time for them to pivot and make a move. should be interesting to see if the new CEO brings anything different. 4th quarter call should be his first I believe.

"Dirk Haussecker (@RNAiAnalyst)$IONS presented hypertension pII #antisense results today (target: angiotensinogen). Looks similar in potency to $ALNY's #RNAi, but much more frequent drug admin required.--> RNAi is very hard to beat, esp in liver.ARWR > ALNY > IONS isn't it Dirk?"
"I listened to the conference call from 2-26-20 and noted the following:1) Ionis expects to have 10 new drug applications by 2025.2) Potential addition of eight new Ionis drugs added to AKCA pipeline this year.3) $2.5 billion in cash.4) Positive comments on several drugs, including Biogen early Alzheimer drug.5) Ionis owned medicines doing well,6) Pipeline progressing.7) Numerous catalysts this year.8) Addition of many new items to pipeline this year.9) Expanding reach of technology, example, optimizing drug delivery.10) Investment in complimentary technologies.11) Share repurchase: Stock price first described as attractive at current price, and later referred to as great investment at this price (which was 56 at time of conference). I counted 28 drugs in the pipeline on the website, with five in stage 3, but Ionis keeps saying they have over 40 in pipeline I think that includes the 18 in preclinical studies.During the conference they often mentioned LICA, which the website refers to as a chemical modification of the drugs for delivery to specific tissues. This apparently allows lower doses and higher potency with less side affects. And don't forget that Ionis owns 75% of AKCA, which is valued at about $1.8 billion.Anyone have any constructive criticism about the above? Thank you."
"the board will be happy to know... i dumped the last of my shares. the company has a lot of potential, but is not working in shareholders int. 5 years of lost opportunity. good luck to those that hang in there. i seriously wish you well and hope its $80.00+ for you all."
"So the market snoozes and snoozes till this gem slips away. Sooner than later one of their clinical trials either partnered or alone will send this stock on its way to heights never expected than buyers will be kicking themselves that includes big pharma. I mean what's not to like here? Over 1.6 billion in cash backing out debt, 40 pipeline trials and counting, a price that is absurdly cheap and ownership in another pharma with equally promising outcomes. Surprised one of their larger partners hasn't snapped them up and used the cash on hand to back stop the cost of some of that purchase. Even at $120.00/share this is a bargain."
Spinraza quarterly sales 30-40 million beat above estimates (depending on analyst) at $363 million last quarter per BIIB quarterly report this AM. Estimates were looking for $319-330 mil.
"Read the ICER report (October 4, 2018): Inotersen and patisiran for Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis: Effectiveness and Value. There are two versions one is a short draft version, second one is a 153 page long version. Below comes from the long version. See tables on the pages 17, 18 and 19. Also see tables on the pages 24 and 25. Check page 77 for QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year costs for each drug) and the two tables on the page 80. You will find cost estimation for inotersen and patisiran, in each and every case patisiran costs more, much more. You can see why insurance companies are adopting inotersen faster than patisiran (its too early so we still have to wait and see). Currently these are the only two drugs that are approved by the FDA. Some time ago, I posted details of the two study comparisons in terms of efficacy, risks etc."

Is there a place for Ions in the Caronavirus cure/treatment search? I read an article in Popular Science that the virus replicates and mutates at the RNA level. Isn't Ions the leader in RNA research? Even an announcement that it was immediately loaning top expertise to the CDC would help everyone and cement that leadership position.
"Below AJ posted a Seeking Alpha article on IONS, it is written by CraniuMD, he holds IONS, ILMN, GILD, AAPL, FB and NVDA. This portfolio alone tells me a lot about him. He said ""I am an expert in neuroscience, neurology and genetics."" To me, he is far more than a scientist, he knows the industry that most doctors do not, so here we have someone who lets us understand and appreciate what we have done (assuming that readers of this message own IONS and/or AKCA stock, I am still adding, I added more today). In my previous messages I've mentioned more than once why I have chosen to invest in IONS over Alnylam, the Seeking Alpha article explicitly explains why. Please read it. There is no need to promote this stock, the longer it frustrates investors the more it will shine at a later date. There is always Right of Passage that has to complete its own course first. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4139569?source=ansh"

"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/15/akcea-therapeutics-soars-as-it-readies-its-first-d.aspxBoth Akcea and Ionis will do well in the future. There would be rocky fluctuations in share prices but overall long term outlook looks much better now, finally money will start to flow in. I am most interested in the LP(a) lowering drug, this drug will surprise doctors and patients not to speak of investors. Contract is such that Ionis and Akcea are to split profits 50/50 on LP(a) drug, although Novartis is a partner Akcea is to market directly to lipid specialists (golden goose). Ionis owns 75% of Akcea but very little of it has been reflected in the Ionis stock price as mentioned in the above article. But I like both companies."
"In the beginning, medicine was based on symptoms, as science progressed pathophysiology was added to medicine, current medical practice and treatment is dominated by pathology, monoclonal antibodies are examples, there are countless tiny biotech companies that have one or few of these drugs to prove that they can extend patients' lives few more months, many of these companies are extremely thinly financed which lead to reverse stock split and other financial engineering, many simply declare insolvency. Enter Ionis, for the first time in human history (others may disagree but Ionis is the leader), Ionis has come up with drugs that go after the causes of diseases, this has never happened before. Why is this so important? It is because treating symptoms do not dissolve the underlying disease, treating pathology brings out better treatment outcome but this too fails to eradicate the disease. Etiological treatment is what doctor's been asking since the beginning of medicine. Etiological treatment attacks the root cause of a disease so no symptoms or pathology can be created. That time has arrived and Ionis is a leading biotech company with a proven drug called nusinersen, this drug does not just extend life few more months, babies faced with certain death get resurrected and unleash new lives. Many other similar drugs are lined up to be approved by regulatory agencies. How has this company been treated? Pariah is the only word I can think of, from within and outside of the scientific community. Without the axiom ""No good deed goes unpunished"" leaders of the company could not have survived. Now the company is enjoying industrywide recognition and commensurate growth in revenue, after decades of struggle Ionis is soaring like a phoenix."

I don't see how we can be down $2.13 with all the updates coming next week. Especially when IONIS stated in below link: RG6042 (IONIS-HTTRx) and tofersen (IONIS-SOD1Rx) are going into stage 3 this year. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/positive-clinical-data-at-aan-2019-reinforces-ionis-commitment-to-delivering-life-changing-medicines-to-patients-with-neurological-diseases-300841532.html
"Here are some back of the envelope calculations re the AKCA/PFE deal. PFE pays $250MM split evenly between AKCA and IONS, butIONS gets it all and gives IONS equivalent value in stock. At about 16 where the stock was before the deal that would be something like 7.8MM shares and would raise IONS's ownership of AKCA from ~70% to ~78%. AKCA would have $250MM or ~$2.50 of cash to pursue their other interests--which could eventually benefit IONS. All of this should flow down to pre tax earnings . Allowing for the now to be 22% of AKCA not owned by IONS this should boost IONS's pretax earnings by some $220MM or about $1.50 per share. Then the good stuff starts. Press release says there could be ~1B in milestone payments which would be shared equally by IONS and AKCA. If you ignore what AKJCA would keep and look only at the ~$0.5B that IONS would get this would be on the order of $3.60 per share and that will flow through the quarter's P&L in which it was earned.However, AKCA would now be owned ~78% by IONS so IONS's share of the AKCA would be something like $2.80 per share. Then comes the real payoff--royalties. Given the possible problems which this drug could treat--diabetes for one--annual sales could easily pass $1B. Press release says royalties could be in excess of 10%. Royalties would be shared equally by both IONS and AKCA. Just assume $1B sales and 10% royalty that is $100 M of which IONS's share would be $50MM or about $0.35 per share. The value of this royalty stream could well be in excess of $500MM or $250 per share if IONS were to choose to monetize it. I think all of these numbers are on the low side and possibly very much so. However, for any of it to happen they have to get through the FDA and PFE has to be successful in marketing the drug, but this is only one of many potentials in the pipeline at IONS>"
I am watching AKCA soar with partial approval if Inotersen. Volanesorsen IMO will be approved soon. IONS still is not getting any increase in market cap even though these are IONS developed drugs. IONS as we all know owns 75% of AKCA which now has a MC of around 3 billion. If this trend continues AKCA will at some point surpass IONS's market cap. I don't anticipate this divergence will continue much longer. I just find it paradoxical that it has to this point. I own both companies and am confident in both companies future. If I had some cash on hand I would be buying more of both. IMO IONS is becoming one of the markets most undervalued companies.
Think I'll add a few now under 30.. It'll be ok by the EOY.
"Folks, I'm a complete novice at investment, but I'm also someone with two kinds of heart disease due to astronomical Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) is determined almost entirely by genetics, so I have a huge vested interest in Ionis' new drug that lowers Lp(a). Gallows humor warning: If the drug works, I might as well support and capitalize on it and salt some extra money away for retirement. If it DOESN'T work, well, retirement is one thing I really don't need to worry about. Unique position to be in.My question is, what would you recommend as a way for a newbie investor, who will probably only be putting a few thousand dollars in all told, to invest in this company? Is there an online stock exchange that individuals can use? Actually I know there are several but am wondering which one to use. Was waiting for stock to drop below $50 to put money in, which I noticed it did a couple days ago but did not pounce on quickly enough evidently. Will probably wait until it drops again before investing."
"Delivering double-stranded RNA (RNAi) through cell membrane is significantly more difficult than it is for single-stranded RNA (antisense). People remember and know that single-stranded RNA (antisense) methods failed to disable the target mRNA within cells. RNAi (double-stranded RNA) on the other hand has been shown to work beautifully. In fact, this discovery has led to a Nobel Prize and Alnylam is well known for that. The only reason why IONS's single-stranded RNA works is because ""We have identified the critical drug design elements required to achieve RNAi (double-stranded) activity with a single-stranded RNAi drug"" ""These new single-stranded RNAi drug designs are an exciting advance in RNAi technology"" (from IONS website). IONS has discovered ways to turn single-stranded RNA to work like RNAi (double stranded) within cell membrane. Major advantage here is that it is much easier to deliver single-stranded RNA through the cell membrane. Double-stranded RNA molecule (Alnylam) is larger in size and requires ""complex formulation or delivery vehicle"" (from IONS website). Alnylam has to live with this. As we all heard through the news yesterday we are, after years of waiting, beginning to see the proof of pudding, that is, beautiful clinical trial results on Huntington's Chorea. Nusinersen was awarded the 2017 Prix Galien award, the highest award known to biotech industry. Babies who used to die within the first two years are now walking around and talking. Imagine how the parents would feel. Many other clinical trials by IONS have shown, time after time, dramatic and unprecedented clincal trial results. This is the final proof that IONS's chemically modified single-stranded RNA is totally different from the unmodified single-stranded RNA. No doubt, Goldman and others still do not give credence to this. True inventors have always had to endure this, true discoveries or inventions have always had to face massive attacks initially only to be recognized later. A true discovery looks strange and wrong, if not, others would have discovered it a long before. So, until our days come we just have to duck and endure the torture, the longer we endure, the higher the eventual price there will be. Add one more thing, IONS has ulterior weapon, LICA (Ligand Conjugated Antisense), this method practically eliminates serious side effects by drastically reducing delivery dose."

"Ionis was specifically mentioned on the Doctor Channel at SiriusXM in an interview with Steven Nissen, the head of cardiac medicine at theCleveland Clinic. They have been doing trials on LPa, lipoprotein concentrations in the blood which are major predictors of heart disease. The doctor said that IONS drug is so far showing remarkable effectiveness in controlling this problem. He says the LPa is a huge under-acknowledged factor in heart disease and that it is infrequently measured in blood panels. He suggests that that will change globally.Here's a link: https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=lipoprotein+a&view=detail&mid=5C0FF8BFE7899281CC585C0FF8BFE7899281CC58&FORM=VIRE"

"BIIB saw the value and grabbed the opportunity ..... the neurological franchise is well worth the cost of admission .... i'm thinking they did not buy outright as their interest is very specific.

I gotta say I'm happy with today's news but feel bad for those AKCA holders that got washed out with the C suite clean out. I'm curious to see what ions paid for those AKCA shares they just recieved for their take of the 125M. a bit shady if you ask me especially because they gave no reason for shake up and this deal did not just happen overnight. not one for conspiracies but I'd be pretty upset if I sold any AKCA off that news

"Ionis Stock Pops On Quarterly BeatDuring the third quarter ended Sept. 30, adjusted Ionis earnings were 18 cents per share. That crushed the estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research, which predicted Ionis would lose 31 cents a share. Last year, Ionis lost 3 cents a share.Total revenue grew roughly 16% to $168 million. That beat estimates for $150 million. Most of Ionis' revenue stems from Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy treatment marketed in partnership with Biogen (BIIB). Royalties to Ionis rose 17% to $82 million.Ionis also reported $12 million in milestone payments and $26 million in license fees."
"I have a feeling that IONS will be bought out. Puting house in order for succession, stock action. If BIIB becomes optimistic about future piline of products it is developing with IONS which seems they are, it will be crazy not no buy IONS while it is affordable, if they waite they will have to pay a lot in future. My guess north of $100."
"Once the Phase two trials are completed then Phase three will commence. When I posted on IONIS FXIRx safety profile being much better than current drugs I was referring to these two Phase Two trials. Also when I posted on IONS-FXIRx safety profile these are the two trials, one on knee surgery patients and the other on renal disease, that showed this drug to be much more effective than current drugs on the market. I think I read it was seven times more potent. IONS's potential just with IONS-FXIRx and their Huntinton's disease drug make IONS worth far more than it currently trades at. IONS has many drugs in development across a broad spectrum of diseases. Take out the 2 Billion in cash and also the 2 Billion plus worth of AKCA stock that IONS owns and you have one of if not the cheapest Bio Tech stock in the market. Crazy cheap IMO. One other point. IONS-FXIRx works much different than current anti - coagulant drugs on the market. IONS-RXIRx stops a particular clotting protein from being produced in the liver, or reduces this particular clotting protein. Whereas current anti coagulant drugs stop platelets from sticking together. One of the livers functions is to produce clotting proteins. I also would presume that if any adverse side effects were related to IONS-FXIRx it would have showed in the two completed phase 2 trials. But the protocol is Phase 1, 2 and 3 before an NDA can be applied for. With this and much more in IONS's quiver I can't see how an investor can go wrong just holding IONS for 5 or 10 years. Just my opinions and how I see it."
"I never invested in Ionis for this ALS medication, I’m all in for their Lp(a) lowering drug, which is in Phase 3 trials now. I have two copies of a defective gene that raises my Lp(a), and my Lp(a) levels are 13 times normal. This has given me very premature heart disease (coronary calcification levels that would be average for a 75 year old man, at the age of 41). About 20% of the population has high Lp(a) (although not nearly as high as MINE), so this could potentially be another statin, being prescribed to huge numbers of people. I figure if it works, I’ll win big, and if it doesn’t work, well, I don’t have to worry about retirement anyway."
Today’s news doesn’t bode well for a sale like I had hoped.
"Below are from Ionis website. A leading Chinese RNA drug company chose to collaborate with IONS's chemically modified single stranded antisense RNA technology over double-stranded RNA (RNAi) method and explains the reasons clearly, any IONS investor would be reassured that they are in good company: ""We are committed to advancing new RNA-targeted therapeutics, like RNAi and antisense, to patients with high unmet medical need in China,"" said Liang Zicai, founder and Chairman of Ribo."" Ionis has made significant breakthroughs showing that chemically modified single-stranded oligonucleotides can activate the RNAi pathway. We believe that this work is the foundation for a robust drug discovery platform that takes advantage of using single-stranded RNA-like antisense drugs that harness the power of the RNAi pathway.As it is known to occur in nature, the RNAi pathway is mediated by short double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides called ""small interfering RNAs"" or ""siRNAs."" To date, efforts aimed at harnessing this pathway to silence disease-causing proteins have used double-stranded siRNAs. Double-stranded siRNA drugs require complex formulations or special conjugates to achieve sufficient delivery for systemic activity. This requirement has severely limited the development of safe and effective drugs that work through the RNAi pathway. In contrast, single-stranded RNA-like antisense drugs can be administered subcutaneously and distribute to tissues without the need for complex formulations or special conjugates. Using its expertise in oligonucleotide chemistry and design, Ionis has discovered strategies for designing single-stranded oligonucleotides that act through the RNAi mechanism. With further development, these chemically modified, single-stranded, RNA-like oligonucleotides have the potential for improved properties for systemic administration while harnessing the advantages of the RNAi mechanism.""Alnylam, an RNAi specialist, has been working to develop drugs that can be delivered to human brain and have made progress but Ionis is way ahead of the game in this area. This is also the reason why Biogen was eager to invest $1 billion for the upcoming IONS CNS drugs, Biogen is trying to prevent other companies entering partnership agreement with IONS in this area. Experts have been saying all along that IONS's methods are inferior to Alnylam's but look at the reality, what works in lab animals do not always work in humans. IONS have quietly loaded up clinical trials and we are going to see a series of breakthrough treatment results. Additionally, nusinersen, volanesorsen (expected to be approved at the end of August) revenues will be the growing armamentarium for the company (IONS/Akcea). If approved, inotersen will add more revenues."
Alny announcement to enter covid-19 pushed their stock price to year high. Are there any technical reason why ions cannot enter same business which is so urgently needed today? I thought we are the leader in RNA technology.
"BIIB highlighted Tofersen today and IONS goes down, go figure. I always thought that if one company will find a cure to ALS or a drug to mitigate the horrible effects of ALS it will be IONS. Tofersen (previously IONIS-SOD1Rx or BIIB067) is an IONS developed drug that BIIB bought the rights to. Tofersen will now be entering Phase 3 trials in the clinic.The results were statistically significant and saw a reduction in the SOD 1 Protein"

"""Through advancements in medicinal chemistry and optimization and validation of nearly all routes of delivery, we can target most organs and cell types with our antisense medicines.

"The market is short sited ( that's an understatement of Brobdingnagian proportion IMO ) when it comes to valuing IONS. I am more positive on IONS as time goes by. Soon 3 IONS developed drugs will be sold into the global market. This is as some post on this board that anti sense doesn't work. Really ? around 40 drugs in the pipeline. Some like IONS's Huntington's drugs safety profile so far looks very good. IONS is developing second generation 2.5 drugs with LICA technology that are up to 10 times more potent with smaller doses. IONS is working on a blood thinning drug that also so far has a very safe profile and could be a Blockbuster of up to 5 Billion in sales annually. Bayer is IONS's partner on that drug. I could go on and on. This is not chimera, it's reality and it's the here and now. My only frustration is that I don't have more cash on hand to buy more IONS. But IONS is my largest position with AKCA second. I will hold IONS for many years and IMO think it will make me a very rich man."

These are the researchers working at some of the best known research institutes in U.S. Why have they all relied on IONS oligonucleotides? When it comes to brain diseases there is no other company that can compete against IONS, these drugs must be able to penetrate blood brain barrier and neuronal lipid membrane because RNAs reside within neurons, here polarity is a huge issue, IONS is the King here.

I want to compare this study to another prominent multiple failure by major Pharms in finding a therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Monoclonal antibody therapy by Biogen and Lilly all seems to be so far unsuccessful. The underlying hypothesis was that destroying and removing Beta-Amyloid will cure or improve AD. Since Amyloid formation is the endstage of a disease process which started long ago and the destruction of the nerve cells all ready done, removing Amyloid cannot reverse the cell death. The same problem is happening in Hintingtons case also. In this situation HTT gene is defective because there is more repetition of Cytosine Adenine Guanine- CAG grouping (>36) resulting in an abnormal Huntigtine protein leading to excess of glutamic acid finally resulting in a dysfunctional protein. Huntingtin protein supposed to be active even intrauterine life of the fetus for proper development of the brain. In other words, the person who inherited the disease the damage is already done even though symptoms start only in the middle ages. The T drug is only trying to destroy defective mRNA, thus reducing the abnormal Huntingtin protein and not replacing it with the corrected mRNA of the corrected HTT gene. What we needed here is successful gene therapy to correct the HTT gene by cutting down the repetition of CAG to <36. Then only we will be successful in treating the disease. One day we will be able to achieve that!"
