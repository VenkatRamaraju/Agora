"Hey Gary another ASO flopand you never addressed my comments on insider sales, Akcea and platelets"
"While the BIIB / IONIS Tofersen (BIIB067) Phase 3 test did not meet primary endpoint, it did “show signs of slowing disease progression in people with SOD 1 ALS.”"
"It's been awhile since I've posted but I haven't stopped following. This period of transition from drug targeting/research and royalty based model to a more complete drug targeting/research, self marketing company has been painful for those sitting in this stock. I believe the time is now to start building a position or adding to positions. This is still in transition but under the covers progress is being made. While the near term catalysts are still trial results; what's being overlooked is their investments in their platform. Now if you don't believe in the platform by all means stay away, but a little deal they made back in July with bicycle (BCYC) to enhance their LICA delivery capabilities is right in line with IONS new business model. They also made an 11 million dollar investment in the company, it has preformed well since then. So don't get to wrapped up waiting for trial readouts, while important for verifying platform, look under the covers and realize there's more going on. To me the big one is lp(a), which is years away 2024 but we should know more about its progress in 2H of 2022. I'm getting back in at these levels GLTA.to Mike: from being all in to all out I'd suggest at least sticking your big toe in the water at this level"
Buy the Monday dip. It'll fall 20% or so so get your buy fingers ready.
Think I'll add a few now under 30.. It'll be ok by the EOY.
I am seeing a few more personal twitter posts of early access administration of tofersen. Also a few fund raising requests to help individuals not covered by insurance. We may be winning an outlier battle against ALS..... 8 hours ago — We are excited to announce that King's MND team delivered the first dose of Tofersen on the early access programme for SOD1-ALS sponsored by @biogen #als ...
"Great anticipation for P3 test results on 1st ALS drug in IONIS pipeline … expected this quarter, possibly this month. ALS is believed to have several different causes. IONIS has 4 ALS drugs in their pipeline … Biogen is running the test phases on first 3 IONIS ALS drugs."
"Tofersen results to be presented this Sunday at 4:20pm Eastern, according to the PR. Only 3 more days to wait. This should be a big topic of conversation at Biogen’s earnings call this coming Wednesday. This will not be a blockbuster drug due to the small patient population, which I believe is about 1,400 in the G7 nations. However, it may serve as a proof of concept for the other Biogen/Ionis ALS drugs and even the entire Ionis neuro platform to some extent."

"I never invested in Ionis for this ALS medication, I’m all in for their Lp(a) lowering drug, which is in Phase 3 trials now. I have two copies of a defective gene that raises my Lp(a), and my Lp(a) levels are 13 times normal. This has given me very premature heart disease (coronary calcification levels that would be average for a 75 year old man, at the age of 41). About 20% of the population has high Lp(a) (although not nearly as high as MINE), so this could potentially be another statin, being prescribed to huge numbers of people. I figure if it works, I’ll win big, and if it doesn’t work, well, I don’t have to worry about retirement anyway."
"As I have held this stock (ISIS originally, now IONS) ""long"" since 1996, the most obvious question I have to ask is; ""Can this company's management team do anything right?"" ANYTHING?"
Love is back??
Today me and kathy woods will make money ..
I heard about IONS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"if ions' ALS drug was working great, wouldn't we be hearing more about it - wouldn't the news have slipped out from patients and their families & friends? I am not hearing anything on the back channels -"
"ions has a nice pipeline. not sure why such a low price for a biotech with a bunch of drugs in late stages of development. i dont have a lot of shares, - ...i am an older investor so i dont like to take on too much risk - if i were younger i would definitely be an aggressive buyer at this price ...glta"

Huge IONS trading volume increase. 2.3MM shares vs 980k average … then another 700k after hours. Someone believes the recent pharma analyst meetings & prepping for Phase 3 data release in fall?
"i see there are anecdotal cases of the als drug working. thanks for pointing that out. great news for patients. it very well could work for some. i looked -the paitent population for als is small though, and the population with the genetic mutation is a small subset of that. any guess on price tag? and what is split btw biogen and ionis? will this really move the needle for ions? i think to some degree but i am not sure how much -"
"I’m glad I moved out of this stock and into INO. I once thought IONS would take the lead in RNA medicine and they might yet, but DNA medicine is the future. RNA medicines will have their place but the much less expensive DNA medicines with a much better safety profile will eventually have the largest market share for cancers and infectious diseases, as well as diseases caused by aberrant proteins. Good luck."
this is the worst performing bio in the last 5 yearsthe market values this pipeline as almost zero patheticsell the company
"Bob, glad you get it because your grand parents never did. Alas, did you dare read Stan's 2005 annual ? Try to Educate yourself of the 14 2005 new products on the way from Vitravene to diabetes, Asthma, cardiovascular, cancers etc. Sorry, all quietly out the back door in the dark of night. Would you like all the rest ? That's easy... it was all of them. Are you catching on yet ? Yes, you can thank me now or later.DARKOUTTONIGHT."
So what's wrong with my post Yahoo finance? Is it too truthful to post?
"Tofersen works. The data very consistently shows there was a benefit across all measures and Tofersen was lowering SOD-1 significantly. There was an imbalance in baseline neurofilament levels favoring placebo. Dr Miller showed the baseline neurofilament levels were highly correlated with clinical outcome. The study should have stratified by this measure in the study design. It's a simpler and maybe better measure of severity of disease than speed of progression. The study was clearly too short. The study team was pressured to limit the time on placebo treatment. 28 weeks was not enough. Based on the OLE, they should have followed for 40 weeks. It's a shame that Dr. Miller used the wrong presentation and didn't talk enough about the benefit of more time on drug that was shown by the OLE portion of the study. Depending on how they calculated the 95% CIs, it looks like a pooled 95% CI across baseline progression groups would have shown a significant separation between treatment and placebo at 40 weeks. But the post-hoc nature limits the inference that can be made. Given the Aduhelm controversy, it's going to be hard to make a case based on the totality of the data. The data is not mature yet. Some patients haven't made it through all of the relevant measurement periods. The best course is to provide an update next year with more mature data and be patient. Sad."
it is their LICA compounds that i am most interested in. i would be a buyer on any fallout here if i were a younger investor. I am currently holding small # of shares ...glta
Way oversold HF’s are picking it up now it’s just way undervalued!

"a quiet board afer the results. i am not too surprised by them. there were cases that appeared to show the drug working -they may have gotten the placebo or not. their cases could have been outliers and the disease progressed more slowly for them. as for the fal in share values, it is disproportionate to the pipeline potential. i am holding onto my shares. i may even buy a little more .."
I remember when Kathy woods bought high She will be selling low

"Good news on pelacarsen for lp(a). Norvatis is beginning a reduced design PK (pharmacokinetics) study to evaluate hepatic impairment impact on the drug, which is then used for commercial dosage recommendations for individuals with hepatic impairment."
"Could be a double from here by next year with so many potential pipeline wins,some fully owned by ions."
Ionis Pharmaceuticals is up 4.99% to 31.76
I'll try again. So in 2020 ions has no growth because of COVID! In 2021 ions has no growth because of..... let me think. Covid? In 2022 ions has no growth because of???? Ok I get it in 2026 ions will have 12 drugs on the market. Makes perfect sense to me! Don't sensor this time Yahoo!
"well, they were able to affect their target but it did not lead to large enough clinical benefit. these diseases are complicated. interesting that they are giving it away to patients free. i guess with no treatment options the hope is patients will scream for it to be approved. i somehow doubt it though. even without the ALS franchise the company is still pretty cheap. there are other drugs for much larger patient populations in the pipe."
"I remember back in 1998 when stan was appointed to the idum board with great fan fair. What most investors don't realize is that insiders put each other on boards as information paid gatherings and a nice get-away. It's another freebie , one of hundreds. You might ask what do the loyal stockholders receive . I have many fact ions histories that would make you shake your heads like bobble head dolls. Peace.DARKOUTTONIGHTDARKOUTTONIGHT."
"It almost breaks my heart to see another JM victim step up to the plate talking nonsense. I can understand cathie being fooled but not 3rd generation newbies. You want to talk about a $11 mil investment ... how about the lil* 300 mil investment wasted and the jobs lost due to a naive expert. Yes, I warned lil* and the message board answer was ""who would you believe...darkouttonight or the Ili*scientist. Sad but true. Remember, I couldn't save the parents or the grand parents and now onto the georgies of the world... but at least I tried. No good deed goes unpunished from old darkouttonight.DARKOUTTONIGHT."
"watching this one, they might get hit with a downgrade soon"
"It's a shame as I have warned about the flaws since approx. 1996. Some families I saved. biib, cathy and the whole nine yards. RIP.DARKOUTTONIGHT"
