"Holding SIRI is like living in Bizarro-world.....Barclays upgrades SIRI with a price target of $6 (!!!)JPMorgan downgrades SIRI to neutral with a price target of $7 (!!!) and the price plunges.Let's remember that SIRI doesn't have any problem refinancing $billions of its debt at historically low interest rates so the big finance experts certainly have confidence in SIRI's long-term future.This is just one more example of how crooked Wall Street is. WC Fields was dealing cards in one of his movies and one of the players looked at him and said,""Is this a game of chance?""WC's instant response - ""Not the way I play it.""Insert Malone/Maffei into the above example - it's their game and we're just spectators. I still agree with Jerrythat it's in Liberty's best interest to go above the 80% ownership threshold quickly and to announce a special, very substantial dividend of which they'll receive 80%. That's what they call ""returning capital to shareholders."" We retail investors will get by with our usual crumbs.I do feel we're deep into the 3rd Act of SIRI's comedy/tragedy so I'm staying pat with my shares. GLTA."
At what level do the “unwanted” buyers come in? Meph doesn’t want too much demand for too cheap of shares from the cash cow. That would be contrary to his purpose.
"We don’t see justice here until we see the $7’s every single trading day for a long, long time. $7’s Minimum! They sure threw us a nugget of info when they declared buybacks above $7 to be too much. They’ve had it all their way for a long time now."
I see the markets “screaming” higher while we remain “voiceless” under the SiriusXM share price suppression program.
"Two posts made, two posts deleted. One about the border was up for over a half hour, so it wasn't a program in that particular case. The other was on the AZ audit. It seems they got removed at the same time. It makes me think ""someone"" who hangs around here reported it to ""someone"" at Yahoo and got them removed."
John Mephistopheles Malone and Liberty Media are literally eliminating the supply of shares through buybacks and the demand for shares through the SiriusXM share repurchase program! Who has ever heard of such?What an evil empire they are running!
"Pressure to get vaccinated against covid is immense. Liberals demand that non-vaccinated people be denied medical care. In New York, you aren’t supposed to be able to enter a bar or restaurant without a certificate of vaccination. Despite all of the hoopla, it is pretty obvious that the vaccines are not working as well as had been hoped. Originally, it was understood that being vaccinated would prevent you from getting covid. When covid cases and deaths continued to rise after vaccines became available, we were told that it was an “epidemic of the unvaccinated.” But the goalposts have moved; now the claim is that you may still catch the disease, but you probably won’t get as severe a case.These numbers are from Minnesota, but I assume they are typical of what we are seeing around the country:NEW covid19 vaccine breakthrough data...MN reports 4,749 cases, 195 hospitalizations, and 25 deaths among the vaccinated since last week's report.34% of covid19 deaths are among the vaccinated.If 34% of covid deaths are among the vaccinated–a percentage that, so far, continues to rise–it would seem that the vaccines have been vastly oversold, and efforts to force people to get them cannot be justified.There may be an important qualification to that conclusion, however: it depends on how meaningful the concept of a “covid death” is. As has been true throughout the epidemic, those who contract covid and later die are overwhelmingly old and sick. Still, if a person hadn’t contracted covid despite being vaccinated, he wouldn’t be counted as a “covid death,” no matter how dubious that category may be."
So does anyone think SiriusXM will announce that Liberty is at 80% at the next quarterly meeting in a few weeks?
"Now make a collection of tunes that can relieve the stress levels of the SIRI SHAREHOLDER ! ! !************SiriusXM Holdings Inc.’s SIRI audio-streaming service Pandora recently launched eight streaming stations to cater to listeners’ demands. This will include songs from popular artists like Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Lil Nas X, Kelsea Ballerini and various other performers. Per a recent MRC Data report, audiences are now mostly relying on optimistic music to manage their stress levels."
Where's Dr. Pumpenstein AAA jerry of The South and his hundreds of thousands of golden shower shares lately?
Short interest 20.82% as of 09/15/21
No Whitney today? Must have had one too many drinks last night staring at the ocean.
Maybe today is just nothing more than a short covering rally....Not much on the volume side but there were 164 million shares short as of 9/15/21...or about 19% of the float.I don't think it is the WSB group but at some point this could still become something to watch in my opinion.
Another downgrade....reaching $7 seems almost impossible
"Just to think, I once viewed a share repurchase program as being a strong positive for a stock and its shareholders.Back then, I never dreamed of the evil and highly unjust schemes that have been employed by John Mephistopheles Malone and his notorious SiriusXM share price suppression program!We live and we learn, I suppose."

"Re: Just moi post: (""Society wants the masses to sell SIRI as it will be trending higher next.So most will be selling at $6.75-$9.00 per share over the next few months.Then what?""SIRI will be ""free to soar much much higher"" again.As it did in the early years when, at or near the very top, analysts were all giving it "" buys & strong buys"".)Honest question: Is the above scenario at all possible given the presumed stranglehold JM has had on the PPS these last several years. If he has that grip, and perhaps ultimateley intends to take SIRI private, what's in it for him to ""allow"" a finally ballooning share price. Honest question.And while on the subject, any guesses on what the supposedly balooning new dividend will be -- within, say, a dollar or so ;)"
"Problem is, if fair value of shares are genuinely higher than today's buyback prices, how do you charge Liberty with breach of fiduciary duty? What if they eventually offer fair value in an LXSMA share swap? What is fair value for SIRI in Q3 2022?"
"SiriusXM has been raising money for “Audio Up” podcasting, while promoting “stock down” under the SiriusXM share price suppression program. It’s never ending."
Who ever heard of a “cash cow” being “dead money” over the long run? The writing of Mephs blatant manipulation is on the wall !!!
I heard about SIRI the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Some interesting new exec hires announced today from Disney and Netflix. Very promising.
"This uber-manipulated, controlled and suppressed stock was at $7.40 on February 20, 2020."
"Only the strong will survive to 7+ per share. The weak will continue to complain, sell or both. Bought in March 2009 for 10 cents and the fundamentals remain solid. I can wait."
"Barclays upgrades , Siri goes up a penny. JP Morgan downgrades, stock free falls."
"At this point SIRI needs to be on the REDDIT radar, this is the perfect company for the REDDIT team to come in and cause a massive squeeze. Screw this management team!"
I've always wondered why SIRI doesn't have an aggressive advertising campaign. There are still lots of people that don't know anything about it or that it even exists. The occasional TV ads are lame at best.
someday the truth will be unveiled about this stock and how it was manipulated. until then i'll keep holding.. wouldnt want to miss that class action!!
"And at the end of the second quarter, you booked $140 million of insurance proceeds related to SXM-7. Do you expect to book additional insurance proceeds?Jennifer WitzWell, the great news is yes. We expect to book and receive all of the $225 million in insurance proceeds in this year."
"Hooper Stevens, Sirius-XM VP of IR, im just curious, do you take Warren's calls?"
"Pettit who downgraded SIRI -- Ranked #6,952 out of 7,686 Analysts on TipRanks (#14,322 out of 15,842 overall experts) PAID RPICK TO TANK THE PPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Another classic downgrade before spectacular earnings report. These analysts are as shady as they come.
"Anthony Fauci is the ultimate bureaucrat. He is 80 years old and has worked for the federal government since the Lyndon Johnson administration. Apparently there is no expiration date for bureaucrats. Fauci has been wrong so often, and has contradicted himself so many times, that much of the public has lost confidence in him. Yet he clings to office like a superannuated senator.Yesterday Hugh Hewitt recited some of Fauci’s errors and contradictions, suggested that much of the public has lost confidence in him, and asked whether there are any circumstances in which Fauci would consider resigning for the good of the country:FAUCI: ""No. Absolutely, unequivocally no.""Apparently nothing short of being carried out feet first will get Fauci out of the federal bureaucracy and out of the public eye, which he appears to crave more than anything."
"Now that they have dropped it back down to low 6, we will now see the 3 - 5 week climb back of to 6.30-6.40 before that they drop it back down to the low 6's again...."
My only stock that time has forgotten. Great job Malone.
Interesting that Barclays would upgrade to equal weight yesterday with a $6 price target. They upgraded it to a price lower than it is trading. More “funny math” under the SiriusXM share price suppression program.
Folks this is the wrong direction.
$1 increase per month starting Nov 2 for new subscriptions. After it fully kicks in should raise an extra 350M a year profit about 2 cents extra per quarter. So when Liberty is in full control of all shares next year Siri will be approaching 10 cents per share net income per quarter. That doesn’t include any extra ad revenue they may receive which they are working hard to increase.
"Hey Strawman, you feeling 15 ?"
"If the last few months is not a MM concept for fake trading which has taken over the last 45 minutes of the daily sessions, then one can reasonably assume that the BB is acquiring the regular 3-5M daily EOD shares through the cooperation of another servile institutional fund who is a loyal subject to Malone's Liberty Media. if that is to be assumed then the (very minimum) of the monthly average BB should lay somewhere around 75M per month ! given a 30 day cycle times the many months this ruse has been going on, would imply a quarterly BB in the amount of 225M shares, and that is in consideration that all days are not equal in the thievery instituted by the BB, and also underestimating the high end of the EOD trading which roughly equals around an additional 5M shares tacked on to the volume in the final minutes of the sessions. We all know however that this projected number will not be what the Q3 reports in late October or early November. Likely it will again fall short of 50M. If they dont report even 1/3 of 300M, then the assumption is closer to truth that most of this late day trading is FAKE, and to make believe that supply is all and well. Which believe it or not is the type of managerial hijinks expected from this duopoly of a bogus management that we've become accustomed to."
"Duke: The Lawsuit--Part 3I don't know if you caught it but The Reverend Jerry said I was getting sloppy and would get fired. He was vexing over the past few weeks and the fact that I have been doing only one post a week. So we are back up to three and if that is too much for you, blame it on CJ. Heaven forbid I should lose this gig. Speaking about CJ, did anyone notice that Q3 closed this week and SIRI still hasn't hit $8.00 on its way to a guaranteed $10.00 by year end. Based on the Fri. closing price SIRI only has to appreciate about 65% in the next three months to vindicate CJ's prediction. So how many of you still believe CJ and his $8.00 prediction let alone $10.00. For you true believers, I have a choice of bridges or swamp land in FL waiting for you. Maybe I will throw in one of each for you, if you are nice.Anyway, Friday brought an AP headline that you apparently missed. US Auto Sales Slump, Stalled By Computer Chip Shortage. I seem to have some recollection about writing about this topic in the recent past. So let's see what the article said. Edmund's estimated that only 1M vehicles were sold in Sept.--the lowest total for the year. Q3 was down 13% on a YOY basis and last year was terrible. GM was down 33% for Q3, Stellantis down 19%, Honda down 11% and Nissan down 10%. Next Q is supposed to be better but that is what they said last Q.SIRI's cancellation rate has dropped to 1.5%. 1.8% was the best all time until this year.That means every person is being offered the $30 for 6 month deal. Question is can they hit sub targets."
"SiriusXM wishes to give away their equity in their cash cow company for as cheap as possible, so that Liberty Media gains full control at a deep discount. We’re missing $4 bucks per share today on 4 billion shares outstanding. We’re missing around 16 billion, Meph. What has Meph promised them that could top 16 billion in missing market capitalization?"
"Wondering. Why doesn't the annual shareholder meeting attract a cadre of the outraged -- a la school board meetings now attracting parents who've had enough of the critical race baloney. Honest question. Shareholders with honest questions for a change. If I lived in NYC, I'd surely invest in the subway to midtown. I'd even wear a tie. Heck, I used to work at 53rd and Sixth. An easy-peesy location, but unfortunately not from my current addy in the Midwest. But the question stands: why don't shareholders show up and ask that critical question re PPS -- demanding an answer beyond ""We can't control the share price."" (Well, they certainly can and are doing so...as we all know.)"

"This is still seen as a growth investment so it's largely affected by the rise and fall in automobile sales.

"Taiwan's foreign minister is warning of war with China and is asking Australia for aid with intelligence, Australian Broadcasting reports.The news comes after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China flew dozens of sorties into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) beginning on Friday.On ABC's ""China Tonight,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said that if the PLA launches an actual strike, Taiwan is ready to repel it.""The defense of Taiwan is in our own hands, and we are absolutely committed to that,"" Wu said.Taiwanese fighters scrambled against 38 Chinese aircraft in two waves on Friday, the Taiwan Defence Ministry said. It said Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them.""China has been wantonly engaged in military aggression, damaging regional peace,"" Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Saturday morning.The first wave of incursions comprised 18 J-16 and four Su-30 fighter jets plus two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and an anti-submarine aircraft, while the second had 10 J-16s, 2 H-6s and an early warning aircraft, the ministry said."
"You were warned 6 months ago. JP? Good morning, anybody there????I gave you all a warning 6 months ago that there was supply chain issues. Its going to get much worse and probably year 23 supplies should begin to return but not to normal. Anyhow, I believe SP will be cut in half valued at $3. Earnings call will be siri biggest day ever. If siri cannot prove JP wrong, woo ha, SP will fall to $3 or lower. If siri gives no response to JP over the coming days, we should see siri sp drift lower to about $4.70. Before earnings sp could even be around $4. My educated guess is that the supply chain crises is going to crush siri business big time sending a fair valued sp at $3. How JP has fair value at $6??? probably the same way that they sent out a report very late in the game. Remember, I have been crowned king of the stock picking. I have a crystal ball that has given me 90% accuracy on all my calls. See you at $3"
"Wouldn’t it be nice if we could freeze the prices of housing, cars, and groceries for 10 or more years, or at least until we wanted? John Mephistopheles Malone could."
I suppose that the SiriusXM share price suppression program has permanently nullified the stock. Looks like the less than 1% divy is really all we’ve got here.
Has this not been a crash course lesson in stock manipulation and breech of fiduciary duty to the minority common shareholders?This has been a huge lesson in the “goings on” of Wall Street.
"Duke: The Lawsuit--Part 2The Plaintiff has an interesting theory--same one I have-- but no proof. Unless there have been some internal documents leaked, which I doubt, the Plaintiff has a theory and a prayer but not much more. So what does he do? He goes fishing and the fishing expedition is call the Discovery Process. The process consists of three things. First, is a Request For Documents. The Plaintiff will seek every type of correspondence (email, letter and recording) involving the BB going back to their inception and involving any one of the named defendants. The defense will probably be smart and give them even more than they ask for but making sure it has no relevance to the case--an old Duke tactic. You see every item has to be read and indexed in the Plaintiff's file. That means more cost and more time and time is on the Defendant's side since the BB go on. So how many documents are we talking about? The BB started 9 years ago so we could be talking about hundreds of thousands and possible a million. Once the plaintiff has the documents and processed them, the next step is to submit Written Interrogatories for the Defendants to Answer. Once those are answered the Plaintiff schedules Oral Depositions where they get to question the Defendants under oath. Pretty complicated and tme consuming. But here is something you have forgotten. The Defense is doing the same three steps to the Plaintiff at the same time. The only people making money at this point are the defense lawyers paid by you guys. The plaintiff's attorney is working on a contingent fee basis which means they have to win to collect. This whole process takes 18 months to 2 years and in the end the plaintiff has to prove that he was injured by the so called scheme. This is not likely but Liberty will be ready to execute the scheme so there will be a settlement. The Plaintiff's lawyers will take 60% of the settlement and the shareholder's will be left with a fraction of a cent per share in the agreement. You think you will have won but Liberty will have cut its final buyout offer by more than the settlement cost. You see the bad guys always win in the end. Should be an interesting two years and I look forward to it."

"Part 1 (cont.)As long as the purchaser can trace the purchase back to the initial offering and is within the statute of limitations, he can sue - there is no need to prove causation or reliance on the misstatements or omissions. Damages are limited to the difference between the offering price and value of the securities at the time of the lawsuit. Although the purchaser can sue the issuer, underwriter, or subsequent seller, all defendants but the issuer have a ""due diligence"" defense that they had no grounds to believe the statement had a misstatement or omission.Section 5 and Section 12(a)(1) allow purchasers to sue sellers for offering or selling a non-exempt security without registering it. As long as the purchaser can prove a direct link between the purchaser and the seller, and the suit is within the statute of limitations, the purchaser may obtain rescission with interest, or damages if the investor sold his securities for less than he purchased them.Section 12(a)(2) creates liability for any person who offers or sells a security through a prospectus or an oral communication containing a material misstatement or omission, is liable to the purchaser for rescission of the purchase or damages, provided that the purchaser did not know about the misstatement or omission at the time of the purchase. Court holdings imply that the cause of action only applies to purchasers in the initial offering, not secondary purchases, but this is not settled law yet. Investors suing under 12(a)(2) can only recover from sellers.Section 15 aids investors by making ""control persons,"" or persons who ""control"" defendants liable under Sections 11 and 12 by owning stock or under agency principals, jointly and severally liable. This helps investors collect damages in cases where the defendant is insolvent or does not have enough money to pay the investor, a frequent situation in securities litigation (most investors sue after their investment has soured).Section 17(a) is a key anti-fraud provision in the Securities Act. It provides for liability for fraudulent sales of securities. Some courts have found an implied right of private action under this provision, though this is becoming a less favored position. However, some courts continue to accept private suits under this provision. Section 17(a) makes it unlawful to ""employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud"", ""obtain money or property"" by using material misstatements or omissions, or to ""engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser."" This provision is closely tracked by Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, which is used more widely by investors suing for fraud."

Strange enough we already a safe similar medication that costs a few dollars per pill and is over 60% effective in preventing death and hospitalizations.

"Over the weekend through mid-day yesterday Southwest Airlines had canceled more than 2,000 flights. Southwest attributes the “disruptions” to “weather and other external constraints.” Both Southwest and its pilots’ union deny that the company’s vaccine mandate is the proximate cause. However, even the Times leaves the question open:""While the union, which says it does not oppose vaccination, denied that its members were calling in sick to protest the mandate, it did ask a judge on Friday to stop the airline from enacting the vaccine mandate and other policies.""Brian Sumers is editor-at-large for travel site Skift and said, “Something doesn’t add up about Southwest’s explanation for its problems. The airline blames weather and air traffic control issues. That may be part of the problem. But usually, other airlines report similar issues. We aren’t seeing that. So it makes me wonder, is something else happening? Southwest should tell its customers more about whatever issue is causing this meltdown. Those customers certainly have a right to be confused — and upset.”"
Time for SIRI PPS to increase before earnings just to fall back after earnings.
"GameStop’s up almost 10 bucks again. Wish we had a little excitement like that here at Sirius, I know, I’m a dreamer."
Takes 3 weeks for SIRI to climb .20-.30 cents but just 7.5hrs to erase it......It's comical at this point. It climbed when the markets where blood red that last 2 weeks and tanks when the market is green....
What we learned from Whitney today:1). 1 “Short” post=4 long posts2). Lied about Ren Tech sale was More recent to pay taxes3) hurts his or her feelings if you Don’t like his or her posts4) lots and lots of waves out thereTime to surf SIRI to $10!!!!
"Liberty has not spared the shareholders in its quest for ownership of Siri. This is reason to believe, that when the time is right, they will also throw the shorts under the bus for their own advantage."
"That need for the 1-8 to 1-10 conversion rate is the root of this evil. They about have the 1-8 ratio right now, but it is not yet time in terms of Liberty’s ownership. Their job is to keep the share price in this relative range until the deal goes down. They’re doing a helluva job thus far."
"Even before the pandemic, California already had the highest poverty rate and the widest gap between middle and upper-middle income earners of any state in the US. It now suffers from the second-highest unemployment rate in the US after Nevada.Gavin Newsom is is financed by what the Los Angeles Times describes as ‘a coterie of San Francisco’s wealthiest families’. Newsom’s backers have aided his business ventures and helped him live in luxury – first in his native Marin, where he just sold his estate for over $6million, and now in Sacramento.California’s well-connected rich are predictably rallying to Newsom’s side. At least 19 billionaires, mainly from the tech sector, have contributed to his extraordinarily well-funded recall campaign, which is outspending the opposition by roughly nine to one.There is little hiding the elitism that Newsom epitomises. In the midst of a severe lockdown, he was caught violating his own pandemic orders at the ultra-expensive, ultra-chic French Laundry restaurant in Napa.Newsom insists California is ‘doing pretty damn well’, citing record profits in Silicon Valley from both the major tech firms and a host of IPOs. He seems to be unaware that California’s middle- and working-class incomes have been heading downwards for a decade, while only the top five per cent of taxpayers have done well."
I find it very interesting that Appl is offering Satelite Communication with the new iPhone 13. I see some common ground here. Appl would generate monthly recurring revenue with SIRI.

"Here are the FACTS from publicly available and reliable Historical Pricing Data:> SIRI Opened on Oct 31, 2019 at a multi-month High of $6.48 and Closed at $6.60.> The price slowly climbed over the next 7 weeks before cracking the $7 mark the week before Christmas.> It stayed consistently in the Low-$7's for another 7 weeks before peeking at $7.40 on 20FEB2020.> SIRI finally dropped BELOW $6.40 again for the first time since Halloween on February 27, 2020.This price action leading up to the pandemic never gets discussed, but it should. The Infamous Pandora 2023 Convertible Bonds were long in place and in play for those 4 months too. But SIRI somehow managed to stay well above the $6.4x Monster for 16 weeks.I am hereby requesting that Whitney delve into it and offer his explanation - because I'm sure he has one :)"
Odd that the law suit isn’t newsworthy enough to be able to find anywhere.
It's amazing that we are sitting in the same place pre and post pandemic.... this is total BS.
"Duke: The Lawsuit--Part 1SIRI Land was sent into a tizzy this week. Someone stockholder filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Liberty and SIRI's officers and BOD were involved in a $16 Billion ""scheme"" that would allow Liberty taking over the company in a short form merger. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is truly brilliant. He is only about 2.5 years behind The Duke and I can only wonder if he came to this insight after reading one of my posts. I thought it would be interesting this morning to analyze the steps that the lawsuit is likely to follow and to give you my analysis of its eventual outcome. But before I get started let me get a couple of matters out of the way. The definition of a short form merger is where the target is taken over after the acquiring company acquires more than 90% ownership after a takeover bid and more than half of the outstanding shares were acquired in the bid. The remaining shares undergo a forced sale at the offer price. This is exactly what I told you would happen and the plaintiff is projecting the same thing. Next I haven't been able to get a copy of the lawsuit which makes the analysis incomplete but it is the best I can do.So let's start off the analysis with something you all should know from your civics class. The plaintiff has the burden of proof in the case and he must prove his case by a preponderance of evidence to prevail. If he is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the buyback program now then he has to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is likely to prevail at trial. Given that Delaware is a pro corporation jurisdiction the chances of getting a preliminary injunction are between slim and none.So now that the lawsuit has been filed and a PI is unlikely what happens next? In real life the BB continue. On the legal front the defense will file an Answer to the Complaint. This is usually required in 21 days in VA but DE may have a different time frame. The Answer will deny every allegation in the complaint except that the plaintiff is a shareholder and that the name of the company is SIRI. You always make them prove every thing. Shortly after that the defense will file one of three motions--a Demurrer, a Motion to Dismiss or a Motion to Strike. They are all the same thing but different states call the Motion by different names. In VA we call it a Motion to Strike while in DC it is called a Motion to Dismiss. Whatever its name in DE might be, the Defense is claiming that the Plaintiff is not stating a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.For the purposes of the motion, the Court assumes that every allegation in the Complaint is true and the Defense is saying so what, there is nothing there that is illegal so you have to dismiss the case.The plaintiff is alleging that the Liberty is not having to buy any shares and the action of the company is allowing to grow its ownership towards the magic 90% number. This is all true but I can find no decision by any Court that says this is illegal. There are thousands of companies doing BB's and it is the nature of the beast that those who choose not to sell gain a larger percentage of ownership. Berkshire's percentage of ownership is also growing but they aren't named as a defendant. The plaintiff faces a difficult argument here and I give them only a 50% chance of surviving the Motion To Dismiss.But let's assume they do. What is next?"

"law.cornell.eduPart 1.Securities Act of 1933Primary tabsThe Securities Act was Congress's opening shot in the war on securities fraud. Congress primarily targeted the issuers of securities. Companies which issue securities (called issuers) seek to raise money to fund new projects or investments or to expand their operations. These companies must attract potential investors. Therefore issuers have an incentive to present the company in a way that is attractive to investors. The Securities Act serves the dual purpose of ensuring that issuers selling securities to the public disclose material information, and that any securities transactions are not based on fraudulent information or practices. In this context, ""material"" means information that would affect a reasonable investor's evaluation of the company's stock. The goal is to provide investors with accurate information so that they can make informed investment decisions.Mandatory DisclosuresThe Securities Act effectuates disclosure through a mandatory registration process in any sale of any securities. In reality, due to a number of exemptions (for trading on the secondary market and small offerings), the Act is mainly applied to primary market offerings by issuers. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act, all issuers must register non-exempt securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Section 5 regulates the timeline and distribution process for issuers who offer securities for sale. The actual registration process is laid out in Section 6, under which registration entails two parts:First, the issuer must submit information that will form the basis of the prospectus, to be provided to prospective investors.Second, the issuer must submit additional information that does not go into the prospectus but is accessible to the public.The SEC rules dictate the appropriate registration form, which depends on the type of issuer and the securities offered. Section 7 gives the SEC full authority to determine what information issuers must submit, but generally required is information about the issuer and the terms of the offered securities that would help investors form a reasoned opinion about the investment.The requirements are extensive, and include descriptions of the issuer's business, past performance, information about the issuer's officers and managers, audited financial statements, information on executive compensation, risks of the business, tax and legal issues, and the terms of the securities issued. Often, the issuer will submit the prospectus with the registration statement. All of this information becomes public soon after filing with the SEC, through the SEC's online EDGAR system.The SEC reviews registration statements to ensure that all required disclosures have been made. Barring glaring deficiencies or omissions, the registration statement is effective within 20 days, per Section 8. The SEC substantively evaluates the registration statement and prospectus, and can issue ""deficiency letters"" suggesting changes.Thus, the SEC can aid issuers in shaping disclosures to meet investor needs. Companies tend to comply because the SEC has the power to accelerate the effective date, which allows the company to sell its stock and raise capital earlier.The registration process protects investors in two ways. Issuers cannot offer to sell securities without disclosing information about the company, and developing and delivering a prospectus that the SEC has reviewed. In addition, issuers are strictly liable for any material misstatements or omissions in the prospectus or registration statement.Enforcing the Securities ActSEC enforcement actions are the primary mechanism for enforcing federal securities laws. The SEC can prosecute issuers and sellers of unregistered securities. Under Section 20(b)can seek injunctions against the sale or issue of securities if the Securities Act has been violated, or if a violation is imminent. Section 8A also allows the SEC to issue orders to issuers to cease and desist from certain activities, and bar officers and directors who have violated the Securities Act's anti-fraud provisions. Additionally, the SEC can seek civil penalties under Section 20(d) if a party violated the Securities Act, an SEC rule, or a cease-and-desist order.The SEC may not bring actions on behalf of individual investors, but the Securities Act allows individual investors to bring civil actions under several provisions:Section 11 makes issuers strictly liable for registration statements that contain ""an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required...to make the statements there in no misleading."" Under this provision, a purchaser of the security can bring suit under Section 11, even if he bought the security after the initial offering, on the secondary markets."
"Sunday poster alleges hedge funds dropping SIRI in a big way due to a lack of confidence. Even cited the fact that a big holder of SIRI, Renaissance Technologies, sold all of its substantial position in SIRI.I've always stated there are many reasons an insider or institution sells a stock. Now we find out that Renaissance Tech had to pay $7 BILLION to the IRS as a tax settlement. I guess that would explain why they had to liquidate their SIRI and other positions.Always question the easy answer or interpretation."

"4 articles on the downgrade already, on the same day, if you can call it that, ""Neutral"" - really !Sooner or later retail investors are gonna have to form some kind of rights group who can meet with lawmakers regularly and revisit the many unjust monopoly laws which John C. Malone currently uses to take advantage of the SIRI shareholder. We need new regulations overturning much of what corporate America now uses to enact their thievery and detrimental actions against investors. Even bankruptcy law allows companies to squander all shareholder value through bad management, file for bankruptcy, and after paying off the rich privileged investors and sacking the common investors, allows that company the opportunity to wipe off half the debt load, issue brand news share with a high price point, and restart the company all over again. I mean would the bank not foreclose on any of us if we couldn't pay the mortgage, much less allow us to stay in the house while giving us more money to renovate ?Also, laws are too lenient on the corporate mobsters whom unapologetically engage in this new accepted form of criminal racketeering. People in prison who commit violent crimes would likely be out on the streets committing more crime if only they too could pull the regulatory strings which makes their crime acceptable in society.This country IS sliding down the gutter, but it isnt for the illogical reasons that the right uses to disparage and condemn the people they are afraid and intolerant of."

"The ratio between SIRI and LSXMA is now over 8 - once it gets to 9, in my OPINION, Liberty will make their play, offering 1 share of LSXMA for 6 to 7 shares of SIRI - but of course, the DOUCHE will have you believe this scenario is impossible, as the LSXMA holders will not allow the dilution. However, we all know the DOUCHE is a very large blowhard, and she does not put her money where her very large mouth is."
"So Whit: You seem to be embracing the validity of a concept that the true performance of the company -- and therefore true shareholder equity -- are totally and legally separate and expendable to the whim of larger ""forces"" that would manipulate said equity SP for their individual personal gain. It would thus be as if insider trading could somehow be passed off as ""just one of those things"" in the rough and tough world of investing. Is it really as simple as that -- and an easy score, in this case, for Malone and Co.? Something tells me it's not as simple as you suggest. But your style is to ignore such cross-examination. Reason enough for many of us to hold in rejection disbelief of your theories. Or am I missing something?"

"Duke: The Empire Strikes Back--Part 1Surprise. We are going to talk about the upcoming CC first and what to look for. The Empire's surprise (not really) can wait to Part 2.As usual, we will get a bevy of numbers and everyone will focus on one or two and say that was a great quarter. The stock may even go up for a day or two but then everyone will come to their senses and we will get the usual sell off while all the regulars grumble. So what is really important?Another surprise. There is more to this Q than just the BB numbers BUT the BB numbers remain the focus so let's start there. After Q2, SIRI had 4.059B shares outstanding. To achieve Liberty's stated 80% ownership SIRI would have to get the share count down to 3.952B or net purchases of 107M shares. The term net shares is important because employees are exercising stock options each Q and this must be added to the 107M share total and Liberty also needs a cushion so it doesn't slip back below 80%. Put it all together and SIRI would need to purchase about 140M shares in the last six months of the year.In Q2 of this year, SIRI only purchased and retired 54M shares and employees exercised options for 6M shares meaning the net BB was only 48M shares. Clearly, something needed to change. In Q2 we spent 85% of the Q above $6.40. This Q we have spent 85% of the Q with the stock trading between $6.00 and $6.20. Who could have seen that coming? Just a lucky break for the company when it needed to buy a huge slug of shares.For those of you keeping track, a footnote in the previous 10-Q stated that SIRI had reduced its share count to 4.050B on 7/23. But don't fret about that number. The stock dropped after that and I think the company went on a buying binge.I am expecting purchases in the 70-75M range with stock option exercises of 5M shares. So let's go with SIRI buying a net 70M shares for this Q. Start with 4.059B and take away 70M and you are down to 3.989B shares outstanding or only about 37M shares away from the 80% goal. The update to three days before the CC call should slice another 18M from the shares outstanding and you should get 8-K notification that Liberty has hit 80% ownership between 11/15 and 11/30. I hope you will all join me in the celebration. Then we can really get this show on the road.OK, so what you won't be hearing anything about is THE LAWSUIT. The lawsuit is just an inconvenience and it will be ignored so Let's Get Ready To GRUMBLE. But what else am I looking for? First I want to see how self pays subs increased and whether the company kept the Q2 momentum going. Second, I want to see what happened with churn and whether they could keep it at 1.5%. Next I'm interested in whether the company admits that the semi shortage is going to impact it's business deep into 2022. Finally, I'm interested to see if the EPS misses due to all the fees for refi's that took place in July--you guys forgot about those costs. All those are interesting topics but as usual, only the BB matters."
Where is the dividend declaration?
We could have 150 million paying subscribers generating untold profits and still tank on any market uncertainty. Profits will remain robust with the subscriber base that we have with very low churn. A temporary chip shortage doesn’t erase the billions in continuous revenue. These guys are jumping on any and every conceivable opportunity to drop it.
No sense in ever reading a single article or press release until we make a meaningful move. Saves us a lot of time because we know that any news deemed “important” would move the stock. Everything else is just “noise.”
"Duke: Everything In The World Of Finance Is Interconnected--Part 3We had a couple of interesting posts this week on the board that show how posters think their is an interconnection between the trackers and SIRI. Let's welcome HARVEY to the board who thought that LSXMA is headed to $64.00/share and since the tracker trades at about an 8 to 1 ratio this implied an $8.00 price tag for SIRI. Good thought on your part HARVEY, crazy Jerry will love you. HARVEY even pointed out that LSXMA hit a new high on 9/7 (50.57 for those of you who care). What he forgot to mention is that it is now back down below $48. You are waiting for $64? That is two years from now. Good luck with that prediction and feel free to remind me of it when we hit $54. let alone $64.Then we had Marc who had an OPINION (as opposed to The Duke's know it all attitude) that Liberty would do a take over when LSXMA hit a 10 to 1 ratio and offer you a 7 or 8 to one tax free exchange. Interesting idea there Marc, for a guy who doesn't understand how an impairment charge works, but what you don't understand is that the easiest way for SIRI to reach that 10 to 1 ratio would be for SIRI to drop to $4.80 a share and I doubt the boys and girls on this site can handle that drop.Neither of these ""thoughtful"" posts dealt with the convertible bonds so you might want to incorporate their existence into your dreams and OPINIONS. Otherwise you are just wasting my time and confusing everyone.A few words on the 38.4 million shares that traded on Fri. The NAZ is not part of the conspiracy to take over SIRI. It is a stock exchange that records the number of shares that change hands every trading day. That means that the 38.4M was a real number. There are only 7 shareholders who own more than 15M shares in SIRI as of 6/30. You can verify these numbers on the NAZ site. Here they are: Blackrock 80.5M, Vanguard 74M, Berkshire 43.6M, State Street 29M, DSM Capital 27.4M, Geode Capital 18,8M and Arrowstreet Capital 17.4M.Friday was a quad witching day so a lot of options expired. That means that people who wrote options on SIRI would have sold once the options expired. Who sells options on stock? Mutual funds so they can increase income. Which of those seven names are mutual funds? Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street. My guess is some of those three sold. They are cutting back their allocation of SIRI in their funds due to poor performance.We can check after Nov. 15 and see if I'm right--13F day.I see a lot of complaining on the board. You have two more years of this, so get used to it or take some action to free yourself of the agony--like see a psychiatrist. But don't sell, whatever you do.I see Crazy Jerry is back. Same old message, hold for another six weeks and see what happens. My message is different. Hold for the next two years and see if you can stand it. Now who are you going to listen to?"
Worthless ung continues red ink tradition.
"Duke: The Grind Down--Only PartThere were a couple of astute posts on the board this week although the authors had no idea how insightful they were being. The first was penned by Driventodistraction. He said, after owning SIRI for 15 years I can honestly say I have never seen SP trading like this. Almost no volume. Every time the stock price seems to rally it gets slammed back down.Michael made the following observation. Interesting that the hedges can support the $6.40 wall to keep the price low so Malone can buy 80%. But if true, why wouldn't the drive it down to $5, $4, $3...What these guys have noticed, but didn't understand is that the buy out has entered a new phase. In the business we call it the Grind Down and I gave you an inkling that it was coming after the 13-Fs were published on Aug. 15. I told you that the next phase of the process was that Liberty would try to force out the small and medium sized institutional holders and small individual share holders. I noted that the institutional shareholders dropped from 727 to 688 and I told you to expect more of the same.The one thing I did not foresee is that the program would go into high gear so soon. I expected it to accelerate after the CC so something has moved up Liberty's time frame. Let's go over how the Grind Down works so you can follow it and understand what is happening in real time. The usual market script has been flipped with respect to SIRI. While everyone else is buying the dip in other stocks, the pattern in SIRI has been to sell the rips as Driven noted. The psychology behind the scheme is interesting. What they are trying to do is exactly what you are seeing on the board. A sense of frustration, anger and hopelessness. Based on what I see displayed in this small part of SIRI Land it looks like they have been successful. If you are any indication as to how the average investor feels, the boys are succeeding at the game and people and institutions who bought within the past five years are dumping their shares and moving on to greener pastures. In the meantime, SIRI is scooping up a boatload of cheap shares on a daily basis so we can move up our projected 80% announcement to the Nov. 15, to Nov 30 time period. That is what Driven saw although he didn't understand what was happening.Let me be clear that this part of the operation is NOT aimed at you guys. That will come later in the process and Michael jumped the shark with his post. The final stage is known as The Take Down and then Michael's question as to whether they can take the price down to $5, $4 and $3 will be answer. This whole game is a process and you have signed up to see it through to the end so don't bail on me now. You ain't allowed of the island now even if you want to.Although if you have been following closely we haven't heard anything from Eduardo or the King of Flesh for months. If you are still out there, please check in. My take is they both fled in the dead of night.So now the question is will we see the $6.40 again. Good question. I don't have an answer but I can tell you if we see it one last time it will be after next months CC."
"I think our patience for this stock lagging will run out at about the same time Liberty gets their 80% ownership, then they will allow it to run. I think the dividend will be raised in 2022 and debt will start to be paid down. THE SHARE PRICE WILL RISE !"
"Dr. Pierre Kory, Ivermectin's most vocal supporter, exposed as a fraud for citing unscientific, poor quality studies to push Ivermectin disinformation used by leading GQPers to justify use of the ineffective and unapproved treatment"
"Duke: The Empire Strikes Back--Part 2Last week I left you a comment that said I didn't know if you were going to get the usual preCC attempt to get the stock back to the $6.40 wall. Apparently, the hedge funds didn't get the message that that nonsense was a thing of the past. So you saw what happened. We got to $6.30 and the evil empire struck back and showed you who really is in control. This is Liberty's party and you guys are just spectators at this point. I hope the downgrade came as no surprise and you have learned your lesson.I thought we should analyze the downgrade because it is a case study in how to inflict psychological pain. The downgrade came from S. Petti at some bank called JPM. I hope you all noticed that this wasn't some no name outfit like Benchmark or Pivital. JPM is SIRI's and Liberty's bank of choice and has made billions in fees from the company over the years. If you didn't get the message, Liberty was telling the Street by this move, that they aren't fooling around here so don't get in their way--because there will be a price to pay. I assume the HFs got the message and will stay away until Liberty has hit 80%.If you actually read the Petti note it is a case study in how to say nice things about a stock while cutting its legs out from under it. What garnered all the headlines was the cut from overweight to neutral and the reduction in the price target from $8.00 to $7.00.So why was the price target cut. Petti stated that he was tired of being associated with the Reverend Jerry's failed predictions and he finally saw the light and had mended his ways. I enjoyed his attempt to employ the biblical language into his note.Anyway, he went on to insult the stock while praising it at the same time. He said the company faced higher sat costs and slowing auto sales due to chip shortages. Interesting comment on the sats because the company has upgraded its fleet and once the replacement for the failed sat is completed, there won't be another launch for a decade. But this was never about being logical.Want some proof. Petti said he was actually raising his self pay sub estimate for Q3 to 400K from 315K which is an 85K jump. At the same time he is lowering his full year number by 50K , from 1.150M to 1.1M. The chip shortage won't really hit the company when he sees self pay subs only at 750K rather than 1.1M.So if you read the note and said the downgrade doesn't make a lot of sense, I would agree with you. But that wasn't the point. Liberty was sending a message and my guess is that message was received--except by the residents of SIRI Land.Mr. Non Sequitor, the former Mr. Silly Putty, showed up and said he still sees a major increase in the dividend in the next few days. So let me get this straight. JPM just bashed the stock so that it would return to a sub $6.10 level and NS and CJ are expecting a major dividend increase that would drive the price back up to $6.40 and above. Yep. Liberty is going to do this BEFORE it has secured it's 80% ownership level and its cushion. What is even better is that no one bothered to point out how crazy that would be which means all of you are more crazy than those two loonies. It is a good thing I'm going to be gone for the next two weeks, because I'm not sure I could stop laughing. I trust you remember my new contract gives me one week off every Q. Didn't take one in Q3 so I'm taking that one and Q4's back to back. Off to play in the World Series of Poker. I haven't played a hand of competitive poker since 10/19 so I am going to start back against the best players in the world. Should be interesting. See you in three weeks."

Hey Phil still watching this paint dry..Exciting stock last 5 years for you...
"Hyping solar energy is one of Washington, D.C.’s most renewable resources. Back in 1979, Jimmy Carter declared the U.S. needed to capture more energy from the sun because of “inevitable shortages of fossil fuels.” Carter said he wanted the U.S. to “derive 20% of all the energy we use from the sun” by 2000.What has happened since then? Despite continuing improvements in the efficiency of the panels, solar now produces just 3% of the electricity generated in the U.S. and 1.3% of our total energy needs.Last week, _______ _______ released a plan that claims the U.S. should be getting nearly half of its electricity from solar by 2050, up from 3% today, because — contrary to what Carter said back in 1979 about shortages of fossil fuels — we are using TOO MUCH coal, oil and natural gas and because climate change poses “an existential threat to our lives.”Since 2014, solar production in the U.S. has quadrupled. Solar panels are now on more than one million rooftops across the country. But installing the massive amount of solar capacity outlined by the _____ administration — a staggering 1,600 gigawatts — will require paving vast tracts of rural America with oceans of foreign-made photovoltaic panels at the very same time that large-scale solar projects are facing fierce opposition.In the last three months alone, proposed solar projects in several states have been rejected or withdrawn due to local opposition.In July, a proposed 850-megawatt project that aimed to cover 14 square miles of the desert north of Las Vegas with solar panels was pulled after drawing “opposition from naturalists and environmentalists, recreation enthusiasts, tribal groups and local residents.”Using the Nevada project as a yardstick, simple algebra shows that installing the 1,600 gigawatts of solar capacity that the _____ administration wants to build will require paving more than 26,000 square miles of real estate with panels. For perspective, that’s an area larger than the state of West Virginia. Setting aside that much land for solar when so many projects are already being rejected is nonsense on stilts.Finally, _____’s solar scheme only serves to underscore his administration’s refusal to save our existing nuclear plants from premature closure, a move that would do more to lower emissions, at lower cost, than any other action.If climate change is an existential threat, then _____’s team should have stopped the closure of the Indian Point Energy Center near New York City, which prematurely shuttered its last reactor on April 30. _____’s team should now be working double overtime to save the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants in Illinois which are on the verge of premature closure, and the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California that is slated to be shuttered in 2024.I would be remiss if I failed to mention that nearly half of the global supply of the polysilicon used in panels has been coming from China’s Xinjiang province, where hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs are working in slave labor conditions. I’d also be remiss not to mention the recent study by three economists at Harvard University who warned about the looming wave of toxic “solar trash” and their prediction that by 2035, the amount of discarded solar panels could “outweigh new units sold by 2.56 times.”"
"Some amount of people fall victim to this every day. Wall Street has been stealing money from small investors for decades and it must stop. As a society, we don’t need them. Their “trading profit” is our hard-earned money. Although technically, they didn’t steal it. They just tricked you into giving it to them.As it stands, it’s completely legal for Wall Street to issue a downgrade, and then buy up the stock once it crashes. All they have to say is, “It was a bad deal at $15, but it’s a great deal at $5.” Never mind it was them that nuked it from 15 to 5.Who issued the price target? Was it an investment bank like Gold Sachs or Morgan Stanley? Does the price target issuer make their own trades? Does the issuer report trading profits every quarter? If yes, then the price target is more likely to be a scam.Trading is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there is a loser. Every quarter, investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Staley report billions in trading profits. Instead of “trading profits” you should think, “Money stolen from small investors through stock manipulation techniques like stop-loss raids and fake price targets.”"

"As much as everyone likes to disparage “Whitney’s” long winded and sometimes snotty soliloquies, he obviously has what seems to be a very astute understanding of what’s going on with Sirius, Liberty, the bonds and Pandora. I’m holding until the end since I’ve been on this train since ‘06, like many old timers here, and I still haven’t sold one share. Is the scenery what I had hoped for over the years? No, not really, but because I’m more than green, and it’d have to hit below my average cost per share of .14 for me to lose money, I’m staying long. It has been a long 15 year ride. Very disappointed in Whitney’s (The Duke) prognostication but apparently he’s spot on with his analysis. What I’d like to know is why he takes his time to write these comments? Is he being paid to do this, and if yes, by whom? Certainly there aren’t enough people on this board, were they to follow his black view, sell their positions, to effect the price of Sirius. So why does he bother?"
Barclays upgrades SIRI from Underweight to Equal Weight and gives a $6 price target. Did I read that right? Some upgrade. Aren't those price targets like 6 and 12 months out in time? Sounds like more of a downgrade to me. Just attempting to keep it real...
"The U.S. economy, red-hot just a few months ago, may be cooling off faster than most people were expecting, according to one measure. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, one of a dozen regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve, on Tuesday cut its forecast for third-quarter real GDP growth to 1.3% from 2.3% last Friday and more than 6% at the end of July.This year started out with an economic bang, as real GDP grew at an annual rate of 6.3% in the first quarter and 6.6% in the second."

"When 10 shares can make a 4 cent difference during AH, then this #$%$ isn't even worth watching anymore. Investors watch stocks to gauge any number of metrics including buying and selling but only as long as the stock is responding to company news and market conditions . That kind of diligence cant be used or relied upon with SIRI only because the fundamental metrics are intentionally and continually sabotaged by SiriusXM/Liberty managements."
"Funny story... My wife just ""upgraded"" her Iphone to IOS 15. We were in her SUV and she was trying to stream APPLE MUSIC from her phone but it kept pausing/stopped working. She finally got fed up and pressed the ""sat radio"" button and .... instant music... I just chuckled.Driven."
"The most fundamental question that could be asked at the 2021 third quarter earnings conference:What, specifically does SiriusXM intend to do with the remaining minority retail shareholders once Liberty Media reaches its desired equity/ ownership objectives?"
#$%$ stock...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! can't even hold 6.10
"Regarding calls for the news media (financial, I assume) to look into alleged ""irregularities"" in this stock's performance over the years:My own theory as a retired news media type is that no one in the evolving crop of media is actually capable of understanding the inner workings, especially any improper inner workings, of the SIRI saga. And if they don't understand it, the news clock isn't stopping long enough for them to investigate and learn the old fashioned way. That costs time and money, and the bosses are spending neither. Bottom line: news media today are by and large weaklings compared to their counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago. And it's especially true of financial news ""reporters"". (Try to name one with any credibility in true investigative reporting in these times. And columnists don't count.) Sorry folks, no media white knight is coming to the rescue here. It'd take a greedy class action attorney team to sort it out, and the likelihood of that is anyone's guess. Then and only then will. SIRI have a headline."
Siri trades at about 1/8 of Lsxma. Lsxma is breaking out. Hit a new high 12 days ago. WATCH LSXMA! Target much higher. It will take some time. @ $64 would suggest $8 for Siri. Big volume today on Lsxma. 12 years with Siri; since pennies. (175k shares)

Will I have to push my taco cart back across the Rio Grande in 2024?
They had some interesting insights about SIRI on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"There is a time for everything. There is a time to live and a time to die, a time to sing and a time to cry, a time to buy and a time to sell SIRI ! It is time to sell SIRI above 6.00."
Coming up on 5 years Sirius will be a 5 dollar stock.
"A SiriusXM commercial just played on the tv, and if I hadn't looked up at the last second then I wouldn't have known. All I heard was Kevin Hart and another actor yelling - ""WHAT"" .. then mentioning lasagna for some reason, then at the last second I looked up and saw the SiriusXM logo. Lasted a whole 8 seconds. I cannot believe that management expects that tyoe of lame advertising to add subscribers. Why don't they just put their contractually bound top talent and top athletes on TV, and for them to just say something simple like :The Best Way To Hear me sing/ Watch me play ...IS ON SIRIUSXM !"
Notice that SIRI is one of very few stocks up today.. LSXMA came back to unchanged bit slipped a little in the 30 min.
One more good article about sirius.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/siriusxm-ceo-recession-worries-digital-upside-liberty-media-1235008129/
"Here, at the end of September, SiIRI struggles to get back to where it was at the beginning of the month. You can also substitute the word “month” with “year” and it’s also true. No gain under the SiriusXM share price suppression program!"
"One has to wonder if the stock will rise on earnings day-could the ""in the know"" folks be buying before earnings after this joke planned takedown?"
"Vellly interesting: ""So, moving along to the topic that we sort of have to cover is Liberty. They are now approaching, I guess, 80% plus and they signed a tax sharing agreement. There has been a lot of speculation that you will shift capital away from a buyback towards a dividend or potentially even offer a one-time dividend. Can you talk about your capital allocation strategy? And how you are thinking about capital returns? Specifically, what you are thinking about share buybacks versus increased dividends in the future?Jennifer WitzSo as you know, capital returns and the allocation, the mix and the amount is a Board-level decision. And we do generate significant excess cash. We have a long track record of returning capital to shareholders in a really productive way through a combination of buybacks and dividends, of course. And I see no reason that won’t continue over the long-term. Obviously, when Liberty goes above 80%, they could choose to participate in our buyback. I know they have talked about that. We can certainly afford a higher dividend payout or special dividends. So, these are all options and they are evaluated alongside, obviously, our options to look at – to continue to look at investment opportunities, whether that’s internally or externally through investments or acquisitions. But I am confident that our Board will make the best decisions for all shareholders. We have a very strong business model. I feel very good about our long-term prospects and our strategic and financial flexibility and all the opportunities in front of us."""
"Ah... it seems like only a few quarters ago that Dr. jerry Pumpenstein was telling everyone that an 8am Conference Call was absolutely a Sure Sign that SIRI was about to announce unprecedented, super-positive earnings that would immediately propel the PPS to $8 - and $10 by the end of 2021....and then everybody with a brain on here had to point out to the English-impaired, Preacher from the south of some country that SiriusXM ALWAYS reports in the morning."
Kevin still loves Sirius stock. Poor guy bought at 8 bucks on Phil recommendation to buy. Good job Kevin.

"Worse odds than the casino:Almost every stock that I have ever owned suffered some degree of manipulation and disconnect from reality.For the vast majority of times, stocks do not trade in sync with positive earnings, company metrics, or analyst expectations over the long term. Completely opposite of everything that I thought I had learned about “investing.”Wall Streets a shill organization and needs to be completely revamped in order to ever have any level of honesty or integrity."
"Sebastiano the Phriek, says the stock is fairly valued and so he basically takes a neutral stance, but if he feels its fairly valued, then why did the market cap lose $250M today ?The fact is that #$%$ manipulative Malone was gonna take it down no matter what before earnings, and used his crony favor platinum card to facilitate the freezing of the gained momentum ...enter Sebastiano."
JPMorgan downgrade to neutral $7 PT. Just at the time when Siri is going to increase earnings big time over the next few years.
"I had a dream. A wonderful dream Papa. Mr. Malone, kind sir that he is in my dream, picked up the phone and bellowed: ""Christmas in October. Let 'er run to 12. One day only. Then it will ALL BE MINE as the little people scurry away with their 'fortunes' "". As Leona Helmsley laughs. But now I am awake, SIRI is up the usual penny in the pre-marke...and Sinatra was wrong. ""Fairy tales can't come true...it can't happen to you..."" seems more like it."
“Chip shortages”Yet subscribers and revenue is plentiful.
Keep it up bidumb!!!!!!
"Hello board, interested in taking a position here if I could just get some feedback on how XM is holding up against people using Spotify/Apple music and what this lawsuit would mean to someone looking to get on board? Help appreciated!"
