"Sirius XM Holdings Q3 EPS $0.08 Beats $0.07 Estimate, Sales $2.20B Beat $2.17B Estimate. Probably going to close down for the day."
I am not very concerned about the chip shortage for SIRI....The company will likely move in more of the app than the car.As somebody who worked in the cellular industry from the early days the car was the start and launching point from where the industry would eventually go.I was also on the earl adoption of cable TV being in the Philadelphia suburbs....The company will likely go more in the add based direction just like cable....I remember the push for all the ad free sports with no commercials with your paid subscription....Eventually you still paid for the subscription to Suburban Cable but you also got the commercials.And finally as I have said before....Sirius reminds me of a smaller version of the old Nextel model....Nextel went from about $2 bucks to $35 where Sprint bought it out.Nothing but good news going on around Sirius right now in my opinion.
"Jennifer when asked in this morning’s CC why Siri share price is languishing this year with all the great earnings reports, could it because of shorting Siri and buying the trackers in some sort of arbitrage play, Jennifer said there could be some truth to that. Then why is short interest down 20M from the beginning of the year. Maybe there are a lot of naked shorts out there. Maybe someone should tell Reddit, Robinhood, amc, and gme investors!!! The other guy on the call said long term investors should be rewarded. I hope that is true, but I really wonder especially when their really into the podcast “Crime Junkies”. It was a very good report though."
"CC scene we'd like to see: ""So...congrats on a great report. But...uh...the stock is down again today. As it has been for a long, LONG time. So, for your interest in, as you say, 'returning capital to stock holders"", may we ask: 'WHAT THE *UK IS GOING ON??????' And how do you address shareholders who have been waiting years for 'progress' like this to reward them? I'll sit down and listen patiently to your answer."""
"The only stock that consistently beats earnings, and goes NO WHERE!"
"Just for comparison...SPOT went up over 8% today after earnings announcement in which they posted ""only"" $0.48/share loss this quarter and profit of $2 million... ??really??SIRI makes over 100x that in profit per quarter....SPOT Market Cap = $55 BillionSIRI Market Cap = $24 Billion ..... ?HUH?LOTs of glowing articles today about SPOT ""performance""...Wanna guess how many positive articles on SIRI tomorrow after earnings? ....crickets....Hope I am wrong but unlikely. We'll see...Driven."
Well we have wiped out the 2 cent dividends for a whole year now. Siri should be trading at $8.50 just so we could keep up with broader market returns over the last two years.
"Numbers that matter. 616K new self pay subs - higher than anyone could dream. I wonder if this is going to be a trend. As the result, total 2021 subs number is almost 1.1M. They did not even care to guide subs for Q4 and the whole year just saying over 1.1M.$588M fcf. We need to find out if they received the remaining $85M from the insurance this quarter. At the same time, they had about $85M in refi costs. Then it would be a wash. They project the fcf over $1.8B. For the first thee Q's, the fcf is already $1.349B. They may hit $1.9B for the year in spite of a slew of cheap acquisitions and higher capex.Pandora's ad revenue - $404M, a strong number. 2022 has strong odds to see the total 2022 ad revenue over $2B, including siriusxm's.SiriusXM's ARPU - $14.84 - the best ever. Their average ARPU for the first three Q's is $14.57 vs. $14.02 in 2020, which means additional $158M revenue in the first 9 months just due to the ARPU.SAC- $13.66 vs. $20.98 in Q3 2020. A huge drop.Pandora's RPM (revenue per 1000 users) - $109.02 vs. $84.46 in 2020. Average RPM number for the first 9 months is $98.44 vs $68.83 in 2020. Another huge jum.p"
"The Company increased its full-year 2021 guidance for self-pay net subscriber additions, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow: • SiriusXM self-pay net subscriber additions of over 1.1 million, • Total revenue of approximately $8.65 billion, • Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.75 billion, and • Free cash flow of over $1.8 billion.Question: In lieu of all these great news, why is SIRI still trading in a single digit when compared to other company? Are we ever going to see a double digit trading at all??!!"
Given SIRI's quarterly report how did a reputable brokerage just weeks earlier downgrade it!?
Barrington analyst James Goss reiterated a Buy rating on Sirius XM Holdings today and set a price target of $8.00
The big question before Thursday's quarterly meeting - is Liberty's dividend tax-free? Did they reach 80% ownership?
"According to Goldman Sachs, more than 30 million tons of cargo now sit aboard vessels idling outside of U.S. ports. It predicts that port congestion will not ease until the second half of next year.The gridlock is fueling inflation and eating into corporate profits. It’s one reason why estimated third quarter growth in our economy is so disappointingTwo weeks ago, _____ announced with fanfare that he was taking steps towards having our main port facilities operate around the clock to alleviate the supply chain snags that are causing so much disruption. Since then, according to the Washington Post, the backlog of ships anchored off the coast of Southern California has increased.For example, as of Monday, 73 container ships were anchored in San Pedro Bay. That exceeded the number present when _____ announced his initiative.Two weeks ago, _____ announced with fanfare that he was taking steps towards having our main port facilities operate around the clock to alleviate the supply chain snags that are causing so much disruption. Since then, according to the Washington Post, the backlog of ships anchored off the coast of Southern California has increased.For example, as of Monday, 73 container ships were anchored in San Pedro Bay. That exceeded the number present when _____ announced his initiative.As for _____’s remedial plan, in almost all cases West Coast ports aren’t open around the clock, and certainly not seven days a week. And even when ports are open for business 24 hours, they don’t really operate full-time.A port can be open at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. That doesn’t mean truck drivers will show up to handle loads, especially if the warehouses to which the loads are headed lack the capacity to handle more goods or don’t open until much later in the morning.Having failed thus far to improve the situation, _____ is now resorting to punitive measures. Ports will bill carriers $100 per day for each container that remains on the dock for more than three days if slated to move by rail, or nine days if by truck.Punishing carriers for bottlenecks in the supply chain seems unfair and ineffective. Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said:""[The] decision to apply new surcharges does not resolve our ever-worsening supply chain crisis and we fear carriers will see this as another opportunity to stick shippers with the bill on top of already massive freight costs.""The National Retail Federation, representing companies such as Walmart, Target and Macy’s, said:""Key issues such as chassis availability and empty container returns still need to be addressed. We encourage ocean carriers to continue to work with importers and truckers to move cargo as quickly as possible and not just pass along the cost of the fee, which will further exacerbate the problems""Matt Schrap, CEO of the Harbor Trucking Association, complained that the new fees will do nothing about the “tens of thousands of containers” sitting empty on chassis, either at the port or at area warehouses that are too full to unload them. Until those chassis can be unloaded and returned to the port to collect fresh loads, the backlog will linger, he added."
"""SiriusXM returned $383 million to our stockholders in the third quarter, including share repurchases of $324 million and dividends of $59 million. Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend beginning in November, which is supported by our strong operating performance and our expectation of the business' continued healthy cash generation. At the end of the third quarter, SiriusXM's net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.1x, and our healthy balance sheet and ample cash generation give us tremendous flexibility to increase growth investments in our business, continue returning capital to stockholders, and pursue attractive external investments and acquisition opportunities that may arise,"" added Sullivan.Oh yeah?...""continue returning capital to stock holders."" What capital beyond a still paltry divvie?"
"I have been always optimistic both about the business and the share price eventual appreciation (maybe too optimistic here) because I believe in direct connection between the success of the business and the share price. My expectations about the business are coming true, gradually. Q3 was very strong but still not fantastic because I did not see Pandora's ad revenue above $500M. As to the share price, I do not see how the business is going to lift it to the levels we deserve in this environment of unprecedented share price suppression .I do not know how things are going to be pan out but my gut feeling is telling me they they will be resolved much sooner than we think. The only feasible solution for both companies is to merge, and it must happen on terms that suit the minority. Once the company is combined, sky is the limit for the share price. I will hang in although with great caution and reservations.Something tells me that liberty might be unhappy as well. They raised the dividend by 50%, which is not very characteristic for them in general. I suspect that they may raise it again before the end of the cycle, and again. It is unlikely that they will get to the 80% ownership threshold this year and definitely not before November 29 when the dividend is paid. As the result, their dividend will not be tax free, which was most likely not part of their original plan. Q4 and the first six months in 2022 are going to be indicative of what is going to happen."
"Pandora Segment - Still Bleeding...Monthly Active Users (MAUs) at Pandora were 52.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, DOWN from 58.6 million in the prior year period. Total ad-supported listener hours were 2.89 billion in the period, DOWN from 3.12 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Self-pay subscribers to the Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium services DECREASED by 59,000 in the third quarter 2021 to end the period with 6.5 million self-pay subscribers to those services."
"We are in Rally mode. Up .005 for a second there. Whew. I'm sure, happy I've held this #$%$ for 20 Years."
"At least somebody finally asked the long time taboo question:Jason Bazinet - So I just have a quick question. You guys have put up phenomenal numbers this year. Your stock has not reacted to those. And I guess my hypothesis is a lot of investors on the buy-side are playing the LSXMA Series spread by going long LSXMA and hedging it by shorting your stock. And it would seem that if that were true, the buyback, you should be using every dollar you can for buybacks and yet you chose right at that moment to increase your dividend by 50%. And so my question is, do you disagree that something is going on with your share price that has to do with Liberty? Is that the right interpretation?Jennifer Witz - I will start and then Sean maybe can jump in. I believe that it certainly we'd like to see the stock react more positively to the fantastic results that we've had this year. And I'm sure there's some truth in what you are saying. We believe there is opportunity in the stock, which is why we're maintaining a healthy buyback as part of our capital returns process. And I think the dividend was just an acknowledgment that we were generally below median for SMP companies. So it puts us in a -- right in the mix where other companies are. But we still have a lot of flexibility to buy back our stock and I think there is opportunity to do so.Sean SullivanYeah. Jason, it's a fair question. Again, we're very confident in the long-term opportunity here. We are deploying significant capital. As Jennifer said, I think bringing the dividend more in line with sector comparable, I think given the shareholder base, the non-liberty shareholder base, I think what we're doing in terms of capital allocation puts us more in line in terms of their expectation. I think it opens us up to more assets under management that are investable against Sirius XM and the stock. So again, it's positive results.We've got a long-term focus. Of course, we're going to continue to buyback at these levels given our point-of-view on what we think the long-term intrinsic value is of the stock. So I'm not going to comment on the overhang or how investors are playing the LSXM versus Sirius, but we're obviously focused on continuing to deliver just fabulous operating results, deploying capital appropriately, and we think we'll be rewarded long term."
"Now, to the projections for the whole year.They guide over 1.1M new self pay subs. They have already 1.1MM new subs for the first three Q's. My non-rosy annual total is between 1.45M and 1.5M.I am still digesting the 616K increase in self-pay subs. They give no explanation. If I predicted a number of this order, JohnC's of this world would have yelled that I am crazy and let down thousands of loyal investors! Q4 will show if this a trend. I am curious what is behind such growth. Could it be the effect both of 360L in the car and out of the car appeal. Don't forget that the auto sales are down this year, and they still got 616K new subs.They guide the fcf over $1.8B for the year. We already have $1.349B for the first three Q's. So, we need to add another $451M. Not a tall order. We do not know if the $85M of the remaining insurance was paid in Q3 or will be paid in Q4. What we do know ios that their refi expense was about $85M in Q3 and they still generated $588M in fcf. Even if the capex and acquisition expenses are significant in Q4, they will easily hit another $500M in fcf. So, the total fcf between $1.85B and $1.9B. These numbers are very important going forward. To remind, there are no refi expenses in the next several years. The capex for the next two sats is reasonable. There may be more acquisitions in the podcast area. Still, fcf over $2B in 2022 is 100% realistic. The total EBITDA for the first 3Q's is $2,101B. Now, they guide $2.75B for the year. Realistically, EBITDA should be between $2.8B and $2.85B. Next year $3B in EBITDA is 100% feasible. The question would be how much over $3B.They guide the 2021 revenue at $8.65B. Q3 revenue was $.2198B, and the first 3Q's - $6.415B. This means that they need to generate $2.235B in Q4. If the $85M of insurance money is paid in Q4, they will make over $2.3B in revenue. We should expect the total 2021 revenue between $8.7B and $8.8B, as I predicted at the beginning of the year.Finally, they spent only $324M on the buybacks, and most likely removed another 50M shares. I wonder what is the reason of the slowdown. They had over $170M on the balance sheet."
"The results in Q3 bode well for Q4 and 2022 in spite of the chip shortage. 616K net self-pat subs is not a fluke but rather the result of tremendously hard work of the business. I suspect that subs outside a car are contributing significantly. The ARPU that is a dime away from $15 is a testament to the resilience and appeal of the product. Pandora's ad revenue of $404M in spite of the shrinking audience bodes well for the next several years. I suspect that the podcasts are a strong contributor to growth. The business is on a roll, and the results are coming. Next year we may expect another $700M to $800M revenue growth. approaching $10B. The number of revenue streams is growing by the quarter. The fcf should exceed $2B by a few hundred million. This is all good news except for the share price. I don't know what it will take to jolt the share price but I believe that it will happen. There is so much quantity and quality in the business but it cannot but explode."
