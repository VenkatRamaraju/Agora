Five Point had solid earnings and will do well with low low interest rates going into the next several quarters. There was NO reason for this to have dropped like it did. It WILL get back to stable levels of $7 quickly.

"Also if you read the full financial statements, it seems pretty clear that this is worth $3 billion or about $20 / share. Will certainly take time to get there and there is execution risk. But I think this 10% jump today is probably a small wave before the next two quarters of earnings come in and sentiment changes."

"OK so they announced that they sold ~750 homesites....average price was $135k! They have 20k more just in Valencia. $1 billion market cap, $350-400 million in cash. So that one tranche of 5% of Valencia is going to generate 20% of their entire market cap with cash subtracted out. Book value is still 20% higher than here....thats with no capital appreciation baked in. Patience will be rewarded here."
