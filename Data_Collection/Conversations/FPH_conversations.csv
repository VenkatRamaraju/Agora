"OK so they announced that they sold ~750 homesites....average price was $135k! They have 20k more just in Valencia. $1 billion market cap, $350-400 million in cash. So that one tranche of 5% of Valencia is going to generate 20% of their entire market cap with cash subtracted out. Book value is still 20% higher than here....thats with no capital appreciation baked in. Patience will be rewarded here."

"Also if you read the full financial statements, it seems pretty clear that this is worth $3 billion or about $20 / share. Will certainly take time to get there and there is execution risk. But I think this 10% jump today is probably a small wave before the next two quarters of earnings come in and sentiment changes."
