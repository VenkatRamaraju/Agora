What reason would Qualcomm's $37 cash per share offer be rejected over $31.25 from Magna? Are their considerations for insiders that are not being revealed? I voted against the Magna merger until it can match the qualcomm offer. Veoneer could even go higher if they resisted all offers.

This company has Good product/IP/ talent resources but just mediocre management team. I have low confidence in management in exploiting its assets and controlling it’s cash burn. Seems it will take 2-3 years to be cash positive.

Pretty certain another bidder(s) will emerge due to the hot sector of EC and self-driven cars being developed. Any co in this space will not let this jewel go without trying to acquire this premier co.
Why did this increase in value when it was just announced that they missed their earnings target?

"I've had the fortune of doing some engineering consulting for VNE. What I've seen from the inside was very encouraging, and the reason I started building a position. Unfortunately I don't have inside information other than about the culture and work environment. This combined with the Spin-off Sell-off effect has be holding VNE for a while."
This is a $50 stock --- 1.4B in cash with only 100M in debt and 19B worth of backlog at less than 1 time sales -- hard to find a better place to park some $$
