Up 20% at premarket. What’s going on?
Why did this increase in value when it was just announced that they missed their earnings target?
Is there any reason to continue holding shares now that the MAGNA bid has prevailed over QUALCOMM’s non binding offer? Could another player be waiting in the wings?
Veoneer is up 8.34% to 25.45
This is a $50 stock --- 1.4B in cash with only 100M in debt and 19B worth of backlog at less than 1 time sales -- hard to find a better place to park some $$

What reason would Qualcomm's $37 cash per share offer be rejected over $31.25 from Magna? Are their considerations for insiders that are not being revealed? I voted against the Magna merger until it can match the qualcomm offer. Veoneer could even go higher if they resisted all offers.

Pretty certain another bidder(s) will emerge due to the hot sector of EC and self-driven cars being developed. Any co in this space will not let this jewel go without trying to acquire this premier co.
Management has a responsibility to act in the best interest of shareholders. How can they recommend that we vote to get $31.25 when their is an offer to pay us $37.
Does anyone know if VNE will pay a dividend?

"I've had the fortune of doing some engineering consulting for VNE. What I've seen from the inside was very encouraging, and the reason I started building a position. Unfortunately I don't have inside information other than about the culture and work environment. This combined with the Spin-off Sell-off effect has be holding VNE for a while."

"There is no way qcom is buying this company because you apes came in and made the company 50% more expensive. maybe qcom wanted it before, but not now at a worse value since the stock has been pumped 50% more."
Why does not body use this board. 2.5B market cap and nobody has any comments on VNE? Not even shorts/trolls. Is it broken? Hello?! Can anybody hear me?
