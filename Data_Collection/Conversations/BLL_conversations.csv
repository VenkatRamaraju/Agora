"Breaking up is so easy to do, and will be done eventually (I guess). I'd buy and hold for it."
What is the likelihood the Ball Corp picks up the glass container etc. sales in the next four months to the tune of 30 cents in dividends and a 25% SP gain?
"""The company's financial position is strong, our debt portfolio is well positioned with low, fixed interest rates and our recently amended and extended credit facility provides ample financial flexibility to invest in disciplined growth and return value to shareholders. Given the strength of our cash flow, leverage at optimal levels, last week's dividend increase and our existing repurchase authorization, the company plans to return in excess of $1 billion to shareholders in 2019 and beyond,"" said Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president and chief financial officer."
"Over valued! Over Valued! Over valued, the parrots always chirp. But it just keeps going up, quarter over quarter, year over year, decade over decade."
BLL is up 5.19% to 80.61
"The 2019 annual report of BLL was reported today. A firm’s reported earnings vary from their cash flows. That disparity, known as accruals, reflects the calculation of the organization’s future interests. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/BLL. Yet, the calculation is subjective and thus could be biased. High accruals are therefore not necessarily realized in cash. This suggests that a firm is likely to perform poorly in the coming years as compared to firms that have the same reported earnings but lower accruals."
BLL reached an all time high at 82.73

Like Clockwork there is Zachs (the morons) again. So hey say a stock that is growing earnings in the next year by 15% and is selling for a PE of 16 is the Bear of the Day. Wow must not be any overpriced stocks out there.

Denver Nugget's stadium to be renamed to Ball Arena. Good publicity for BLL.
"Follow the the three day rule, the stock went down because they changed their management team, wait a while, 2 days at max, then u can enter with them, but is the stock doesnt look goid in 2-3 days, then wait, you might be able to get a better deal"

Buyout at $47 a share equivalent as BLL sells Aerospace Division and takes Food and Aerosol Packaging private. That 's what I just heard.
Care to guess why this company has a positive reaction to an EPS miss but revenue beat. Because this company is famous for their ongoing efforts and abilities to cut costs that will eventually let the increased revenues translate to the EPS. Worked at Ball Golden for 27 years
"IMO, I would start buying here."
how low we going....37.50?
p/e still too high. fast trade at about 34
It's about time for Zachs to come out with their 8th strong sell on ball in the last two months.
"Multiple ""scheduled"" sells of -6% over the last 6 mths. (About $175,000,000 each time) Is this a reasonable, deliberate strategy, or is somebody really looking to unload??"
ball aerospace will provide the SPHEREx spacecraft and mission integration (NASA 2019 Feb 13)
What just happened...
"OK, so why are they not splitting the stock. They have always done splits when it reaches these levels."
Is the craft beer market's recent plateau starting to impact BLL?
I am glad I found this stock. I am a big gardener and canner and this was a no brainer for me. Aluminum cans are being used in place of plastic more and more and this companies fundamentals are excellent.
BLL is up 8.56% to 40.09
"Ball has been the ultimate annuity for me.I first invested in BLL in December 1982 when I was a young employee fresh out of college. They had a neat program where you could invest up to $500/month and get $100/month matching with no vesting period. I put in the max from the first month I was eligible. I sold off some over the years to make a down payment on my first home. My wife worked there for a while and we both invested in this program for a while. I left the company 11 years later but I have continued to own the stock in some quantity in either my IRA's or taxable accounts ever since. My division of Ball has long been sold off, but my average stock price increase per year has been 11% plus dividends (another approximately 1% per year). Not bad for a ""non-sexy"" company."
MK your guess of a low of $37.50 looks to be right on at the moment.
I have held my BLL stock for 21 years. On Friday I sold 2/3. It was time to ring the cash register. I am not too optimistic about the economy. No one wins with trade wars.
Market up + earnings beat = Ball down
Which is better buy?BLL or CCK
"The analysts keep talking about better stocks to buy every time they rate BLL, but BLL continues to outperform year after year. Up over $4/share and another new high again today. I see another split in my crystal BLL."
"Ball goes to 80 and then yet another split within 18 months. Been watching this company (and working for it) since 1978 and this will go like clockwork Today's date May 3 2019. This of course assumes a stable market, no major destabilizing activity"
I'm thinking Warren buffet may be doing a little buying of this stock good for us
Why the intraday drop?
Going to 37
