"Clearly the only gap that needs to be filled is the one between QQQQQQ's ears. Hey 6Q, I will make a deal with you. If it pulls back to a 70-71 handle, which could only happen with an overall market correction, I will double my position."
Poor growth....Amazon has done a 1000 times this...
Need more volume
Why the intraday drop?
"Well Zack has a strong sell on Ball, that means it is probably time to start buying. There wrong more often than Cramer."
"Ball has been the ultimate annuity for me.I first invested in BLL in December 1982 when I was a young employee fresh out of college. They had a neat program where you could invest up to $500/month and get $100/month matching with no vesting period. I put in the max from the first month I was eligible. I sold off some over the years to make a down payment on my first home. My wife worked there for a while and we both invested in this program for a while. I left the company 11 years later but I have continued to own the stock in some quantity in either my IRA's or taxable accounts ever since. My division of Ball has long been sold off, but my average stock price increase per year has been 11% plus dividends (another approximately 1% per year). Not bad for a ""non-sexy"" company."

"The 2019 annual report of BLL was reported today. A firm’s reported earnings vary from their cash flows. That disparity, known as accruals, reflects the calculation of the organization’s future interests. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/BLL. Yet, the calculation is subjective and thus could be biased. High accruals are therefore not necessarily realized in cash. This suggests that a firm is likely to perform poorly in the coming years as compared to firms that have the same reported earnings but lower accruals."
Like Clockwork there is Zachs (the morons) again. So hey say a stock that is growing earnings in the next year by 15% and is selling for a PE of 16 is the Bear of the Day. Wow must not be any overpriced stocks out there.
Market up + earnings beat = Ball down
BLL reached a 52 Week low at 53.11
Which is better buy?BLL or CCK
BLL is up 6.25% to 59.52
I have held my BLL stock for 21 years. On Friday I sold 2/3. It was time to ring the cash register. I am not too optimistic about the economy. No one wins with trade wars.
"Follow the the three day rule, the stock went down because they changed their management team, wait a while, 2 days at max, then u can enter with them, but is the stock doesnt look goid in 2-3 days, then wait, you might be able to get a better deal"

Shorty QQQQQQ getting busted every day by this stock. First he called for retracement and it just pounds forward. Next he says insiders are selling and of course there is news out today that insiders are buying. He says volume is drying up and it is doing anything but. So he is 100% wrong. What a great contra information source.
BLL is down 5.79% to 71.65

Nice to see it hold up over $80.00. Although it is much meaningless other than psychologically a stock split will be announced before the end of the year IMO
Ball is down 6.41% to 65.29
It's about time for Zachs to come out with their 8th strong sell on ball in the last two months.

Each REXMY represented 5 ordinary Rexam shares. The Rexam shares were all acquired by BLL Ball Corp for a combination of BLL shares plus cash. Cash was the majority of the value received. Ball will continue to be domiciled in the US.Does anybody have tax implication info for US REXMY ADR holders?
What is the likelihood the Ball Corp picks up the glass container etc. sales in the next four months to the tune of 30 cents in dividends and a 25% SP gain?

Care to guess why this company has a positive reaction to an EPS miss but revenue beat. Because this company is famous for their ongoing efforts and abilities to cut costs that will eventually let the increased revenues translate to the EPS. Worked at Ball Golden for 27 years
"Ball goes to 80 and then yet another split within 18 months. Been watching this company (and working for it) since 1978 and this will go like clockwork Today's date May 3 2019. This of course assumes a stable market, no major destabilizing activity"
Looks like a blowout quarter

"What I enjoy most about this rexam deal is Ball will easily make up for the divestitures, if they chose, within a few years. First they will add 10 to 15% of the capacity to the existing Rexam lines just by applying their expertise. Second, they are masters at finding room to squeeze in another line in existing facilities. Divestiture? What divestiture will be the question within 5 years, if they so chose."
