The flow of upgrades just reflect improved macro environment mainly market rates. There is nothing idiosyncratic. There is no company comments on the status of transition. The problem of Citibank now is there is little to none announced developments that would help analyst adjust valuation models.
C is a drag in my portfolio along with MU . Getting tired of beating earnings and going nowhere. Seems to me there are better fish in the sea. You invest to make money not to watch it sit there. I'm probably going to Phase out my holdings and add elsewhere.
FAUCI SAID GET THE JAB AND WEAR A MASK OR 2. NOW WE SEE WHAT HE DOES TO PUPPIES. ARE WE WAKING UP YET?
"any reason for this weakness? cheapest bank stock, good management, healthy fundamentals and growing..."
"Get your popcorn ready, looks like we're (Citi and the rest of the majors) in intermission between Act 1 and Act 2. In this short video clip, Mike Mayo goes after Citi for not revealing bonuses to top execs and what targets they need to hit. He's also looking forward to Act 2 where we have loan growth, higher interest rates, and traditional banking revenues.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-10-12/citigroup-s-rigged-bonus-system-rewards-top-executives-mayo"
Even with the wind down of these franchises- $7 billion of additional tangible common equity will be reached. There will be write downs but the end result will be positive. Keep these buybacks going while so many are confused by these headlines!!
"Given the size of Citibank Korean business and using analogy of HSBC exits in the same jurisdiction shareholders could expect a cost over 1 Bill with hard to define the upper range. Standard Chartered has also been struggling with Koren business. Barclays left Korea with significant charge on my memory. Given that Citi announced that charges will be spread till 2023 it could affect operating margins for the next 2-3 years and keep operating costs higher for longer that expected. Of course revenue growth could mitigate such cost pressure leading to better operating leverage. However, at the moment both are not visible. Most likely shareholders will see strategic and execution details on 2022 Investor Day that would take at least 3-5 years before real benefits of this management transformation arrive. I do not think the management bothers itself with emergency related to shareholder return from market capitalization. Returns from increased dividend payout ratio or buybacks will provide only slight boost or at best support stock price. In my opinion the longer term risk/return ratio does not look great for Citi at the moment."
Do you think there is a chance that it will rise to 75-76 this year?
This is a reflection on Citi’s poor management. It went from bad to worse.
"""Citi becomes the first Wall Street bank to agree to racial audit"" Bloomberg . These stock it's going to pop , trade acordinly"
The management knew that Korean news is negative for the market. The bank rushed to issue a statement the exits are accretive to shareholders and capital. Once again some unknown long term benefit along with return of capital has been used to calm growing investor pessimism. This management is taking its time to see what is going to happen from their strategic refresh without communicating realistic rather than general and abstract lines of better operating performance ahead and ideal excellency.
"Banks slip as Treasury yield curve flattens, a spike in us2yt flattened the yield curve"
"When you look at Citi’s stock current valuation relative to its peers, relative to its capital return, relative to its projected earnings 1-3 years out this is where it stands:1) Below $77 is ridiculously cheap2) $77-$85 cheap3) $85-$90 fair value"
"A lot less ""Social investing"" and a lot more ""Looking out in the interest of shareholders "" is warranted."
Citi really doing good their only down 2 percent by 12:30. Jane must be working overtime.
"They just don't let it grow, all the best banks in the green zone except us!!!! It's not funny anymore!!!! Can't you see that? Is she being pressured on purpose, is it legal? I understand everything perfectly, they have problems, but this bank consistently makes a profit, it does not work in the negative!"
At this rate Jane is falling behind the other large banks 5% to 10% per week. Jane is really working hard for the stockholders. HAhaha
Love this stock and all its wokeness! Keep buying back these cheap shares
"I don’t like￼ head games, fire her. Some of the other financial are saying growth coming up."
What is holding this stock down ? Bac and JPM always seem to move a lot higher..
Gonna pick my spot to sell never to return. This wokeness is anti shareholder and has no business within business. Countries all over the world are warning us that this craziness is ruining our country. Business is business and wokeness is for social workers. Who would have imagined that France would consider us to liberal.Wow.
"Hey CFO ! you remember that you have an active buyback program, right?"
"When Jane talks... people listen! (judging by the stock price, she must not speak good things)sad, Corbat ""the dingbat"" sold SB:Smith Barney... they make money the old fashioned way... they earn it!"
Shareholders are getting brutalised while BOD pay themselves huge bonuses with their compensation scheme to “retain talent”. My portfolio is 10% Citi and this was my greatest mistake.
"If Citigroup keeping the range in 70.8 - 71.8 till the end of Oct, it will have a new breakthrough in November.It would find the new high at $75-76 at least.But I hope, it could go through $80. Citigroup is undervalued for so long time."
"So far the strategy to exit consumer businesses in 13 countries has been quite expensive and negative to Citi book value. Australian exit had 680 Mil pretax operating loss which Marc Mason said would be neutralized and 800 Mil capital released. Now Korean business has unknown cash expense spread till 2023 on exit. On top of that liquidation sale of business is unlikely to go without further writedowns and additional expenses. Investors do not know how other asset sales will eventually end up with future potential accounting and material losses. Given challenging market conditions and timing of disposals reluctant bidders could pay premiums less than original price paid by Citi for such assets. It will lead to goodwill reductions and capital losses. Even if capital released, additions to tangible equity could still be less accretive if sales occur at prices less than originally paid for such businesses. Another question is as exits progress and costs are removed from bank operations, what the tradeoff is between such cost reduction and lost revenue from sold businesses. CFO keeps saying that capital will be reinvested in higher return businesses but Citibank history shows that such investments had quite long time before they delivered actual incremental returns for example in equity or retail card businesses which are very competitive lines. Just saying that management expects 7 Bill of capital release which can be returned to shareholders is not a value proposition. Management has not transparently communicated strategic exit details and expectations to investors to estimate present value of cost of asset sales vs potential benefits. I am pretty sure top leaders have their estimates and expectations but they refuse to communicate them although it could be helpful."
"Jane and Mark probably just dollar cost averaging their quarterly stock option grants... Not in their best interest to have a high stock price. Even a broken clock is right twice daily. They may end up ""lucking"" themselves a fortune eventually. CEO's should be paid for PERFORMANCE! Not by their ""wokeness"" whatever that means. Start by clawing back the $500M from Revlon"
This just came out from the top.Citi is going to fire any employee who doesn't get the vcine.Wells and BoA are right behind.
"For those Equity, Diversity & Incompetence Fans.....I think Helen Ready said it BEST where it comes to Jane Fraser! ""I am WOMAN here me BORE with Earnings Analysts chose to IGNORE and our stock still trades at 20% discount to Book Vaaaaalue""!"
There are rumors that some banks may drop out from bidding for Citi's consumer business assets due to high valuations from the seller. Also there are some regulatory restrictions on high net wroth clients in some Asian countries that could lead to lost relationship with US bank. On top of that Democrats seem to study an option of taxing stock buybacks which could make them less attractive for businesses.Today was a very strange day for Citi stock trading. It did not even recover on rise in market rates and market indexes (market beta). The rest of large bank shares performed much better.
What price per paper do you expect by the end of 2021?
"$79 before Nov 20No fear to buy and hold now.I want to buy at 68.8, seems no chance. too bad. Too strong."
Surprisingly a word from such company like Snap could remind people that astronomic growth embedded in analyst forecasts is unlikely till real economy reopens. I just do not understand how people speculate on online advertisers and social network businesses that collect 2/3 of their revenue from advertising to grow big when real economy faces all current headwinds. At the end these companies do not produce real products and services that people need and consume. They depend on spending and capital budgets of advertiser. Why the market assigns higher valuation multiples for such businesses is a puzzle to me. The growth to value gap is just getting bigger and there is no end in sight.
Jane gets a lot of airplay and love from finance.yahoo DJs. From Wall St? Not much. This company is unmitigated mess.
Lucky tha Jane is buying back stock instead of raising the dividend. Just think where the stock would be trading without the buybacks.
"Jane Fraser : "" We also continue to make progress refreshing our strategy. In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, we're deep in the second round for of bids for the remaining exit markets."". Second round! from transcript of conference call, I find that quite exciting! Buy this stock with both hands!"
cup and handle with handle completing in next 3 weeks maybe we then move up to the 80s. good luck
"After seeing JPM report this morning it seems unlikely that Citi could show better performance in FICC. Rise in market rates has probably left banks unable to benefit in such short period of time. Another note has raised doubts by Wells Fargo analyst about executive compensation rewards. The Board compensation decision to executives provides incentives for regular job outright rather than for work with incremental operational improvements. The new CEO has been almost 8 months on job and shareholders still do not know what and when to expect from such management except some general statements about excellency and ongoing transition with lower revenue and higher expenses. While management acknowledges emergency, it at least resists to communicate it to shareholders through update of current status of transition. Seems like old management team under Corbat - general promises, updated strategic vision in 2022, failure on economy and market headwind excuses. Today JPM highlighted some strategic trends in its business - more branches in low to mid income demographics and expansion through digital channels to international consumer markets. Citi is on a path in an opposite direction - exit international consumer banking and cost savings through branch cuts and digitization. No wonder that revenue in GCB has been falling steadily and will fall further on exits."
Forward PE of 8 and buying back over 2% of shares a quarter. Sales of Asia units coming up. Accumulate while you can.
I have not found a single bank except Citi that would be in the red zone for half a year !!!!
"It’s been fun but I’m out. Made some great money trading Citi early in the year but this thing won’t budge. Think it will have it’s day in the sun but that’s going to be a while. I may rotate back at some point but hanging on has been painful. I like HSBC. Not buying that now, but not talked about much here - worth a look. Best."
"Who knows what happen to Citigroup?BAC is growing, but Citigroup is always downward"
Why did it fall by 2.64%!?????? Isn't that too much?
So if you take the loan reserve money out then they missed their number. Fire Jane and Mark would be the right thing to do and get a real CEO and CFO and stop dilly dallying around.
This is what it looks like when the stock has little fundamental support and investor confidence. The beta kings will just game it based on momentum market trends. I doubt that current management actually cares about it. The problem is not that the stock price is falling. The problem is that investors and shareholders are left at the mercy of market momentum forces. The problem is that the discount to peers is just getting bigger. People see that and it undermines their confidence. Citi's stock price is even in low correlation with industry ETFs. It feels like it is in confidence crisis. Still management refuses to communicate transparently and clearly the status of business transformation.
Once again Citi is the worst performer in financials. I gave up and sold 40% of my holdings. Keeping 60% for a miracle.
"I just do not know how Jane is planning to grow business in such competitive landscape even in Asia. All the strategic points in presentation that she likes to refer to are good but management does not say how to accomplish them. Still investors should give her a chance. As she exits consumer businesses around the globe, it is hard to see how she plans to grow wealth and asset management as building new customer relationships and bring more wealth and assets under management through consumer and private banking could be illusive. In corporate W&A management Citi faces fierce competition even from domestic rivals like JPM, GS and MS. It is unclear why Citi's unique global digital platform could provide competitive advantage against other US investment banks with the same technology infrastructure and higher or similar quality investment products and services. It is hard to see what Jane has in mind as competition crusher. It sounds a little ideal without disclosure of execution lines along announced strategy. It is just hard to believe that global digital platform could grow business if you do not fill it up with high quality products and services. What is unique in Citi product and service offerings that competitors do not have? In North America Citi has lost rivalry in wealth and asset management and it is unlikely the bank gains market share any time soon. There is too much of unknown and unconvincing just general statements. Even the management urgency is not communicated to shareholders in a way to improve confidence."
"Next week the banks will be getting upgraded, that should move Citi slightly higher..."
"This harmless quote from wacky Jim Cramer is probably responsible for the stocks decline today, in addition to Jane Fraser's uninspired leadership and conference call last week. Although Citigroup Inc’s (NYSE: C) numbers came in better than expected, the quarter still had “some issues,” he said. While the bank didn’t make much progress last quarter, there were no “real setbacks either.”"
"Just read the news. I guess she is busy with her public appearances at different summits talking about everything from China and climate change to COVID and delicious fish in Scotland while market beta kings just squeezing her bank stock price. I wonder whether she actually cares about shareholders at the moment. Of course pension funds and asset managers are important for Citi but is there something for individual and retail investors in her mindset universe. She reminds me of an old banker 30 years ago at the time of my employment who said: ""Dont worry, fool money is not our business."""
Good time to start the buybacks back again at 11% below TBV. Hopefully 40-45 million shares bought back in Q4.
"It is going to be ""brutal winter"" for markets Jane said. It is particularly true for Citi investors in the next 4-5 months. Even in March the investor could be disappointed as it looks very likely again as with Corbat that this management is going to issue longer time guidance and targets to hit promised ""excellency"". While urgency is what the management talks about on multiple public appearances, it refuses to provide even some rough guidance on timing and execution of the strategy. In the meantime market beta kings are not going to wait for Citi Investor Day. If some selloff arrives on economy or market risk, it will wash out thin investor confidence in Citi and push market stock price down with unexpected and brutal magnitude ."
This is the last trading day in October and there is a lot of option trading and institutional rebalancing. Now the stock is going ex dividend. I am really concerned what quants could do to this stock. It is very unlikely that shareholders will get any fundamental support or at least supportive updates till the end of 2021 given management reluctance to step away from general and abstract strategy guidance. Could expected tapering change something next month? I doubt it as without some sort of reasonable guidance or transformation status update it is less likely to spur investor confidence. Even recent analyst comments show confusion and uncertainty. Few emails to shareholder relationship and investor relationship have been left unanswered since Q3 earnings call. I would recommend retail and individual shareholders keep emailing Citi for more open and transparent communication. To me the bank is clearly in confidence crisis.
I bought Citibank shares before 2008 Great Recession at $50 a share. Then Citibank declared 1 for 10 reverse stock split. Now my Citibank share has cost basis of $500. Unfortunately Citibank trades today at $71. I will recover my cost when Citibank goes up to $500 form $71. How do I have to wait for it yo happen???? Anyone has an idea????
"I think Citi is buying back shares today. As of Jane, I would support her for now as she needs time to clean up something deep inside bank. I agree that she is talking too much about racial equality, diversity, equal gender opportunity initiatives etc. However, having tons of political and regulatory pressure on banks she has no choice. My problem with her management style so far is simple - tons of general statements and abstract strategic presentations and little details on specific issues, nuances and execution details. Shareholders have deserved that for too long. I understand she may not communicate directly to the markets many things but the way she walks around when analysts ask plain questions is not something to like in CEO. Her CFO is even worse acting like a Harvard graduate student during class project discussion resisting to provide details and financial metrics beyond general comments."
"About 2% down, JPM .8%"
"Great….another whole idea with a 1 billion dollar social equity fund. Hey, here’s an idea…..how about doing something to boost the stoke price. It’s a crazy thought but it might make shareholders happy. That should be their woke agenda. Woke up that sleeping board room"
When they sell these Asia banks their low profits will feel it and their top and bottom line will feel the pain. They can't /want even tell the stockholders their buyback plan for this quarter. Their waiting on their boss to tell them what they can do (boss is the FED). Jane and Mark all ready said they are going to reinvest it and stockholder would not see it unless they ran out of ideas.
"I believe the reason citi is negative is because today is ex- dividend,people can sell and still get dividend,which makes no sense to me,why sell when it’s way under valued!!!!!!!"
"Get woke, shareholders go broke"
"Warren Buffett once said that it is wise for investors to be “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”"
"MasterCard’s EPS to Grow 36% to $2.19 in Q3, Revenue to Jump Nearly 30% and Jane is saying Citi is going to crash. Citi is the largest masterCard system world wide I believe! A Citi card will almost always be a Mastercard. Citibank’s current VISA cards are the Costco Anywhere Visa Card. Come on Jane quit abusing the stockholders."
"I didn't listen to the conference call but I can only assume Jane Fraser was less than inspiring. She needs to be gone yesterday and the entire BOD that appointed her needs to be replaced. The stock failing to rise even after blow out earning, underscores investors' lack of confidence in her."
"Analysts estimates from 80s to 118 per share, liquidation value in the 90s….can’t get out of the low 70s. Seems like something isn’t working for this company. Time to make some changes and support the share holders. Buy back, buy back and buy back would be a good start."
"Citi does not have the right strategy to attract investors, if the stock is growing, then there will be more investors, and they are trying to lure with a cheaper price and only with a promise and not a deed!"
"Just breakthrough $74, it will go to $79, then $86-90If to raise the interest rate, $120 in the beginning of 2022"
"This thing is such a joke. Literally no upwards movement for months. No matter what the fed, quarterly reports or anything else it’s stagnant or down."
"I bought this last November for $42.62 so unlike a lot of you folks - I'm very happy with the stock performance. For whatever reason C is the Rodney Dangerfield of major bank stocks - more than half the time it's not even mentioned while everyone is focused first on the golden boy Dimon and then WFC and BAC. I'm getting a dividend of around 4.8% on my money while I wait for the ""market"" to get its head out of Tesla's and other darling stocks with ridiculous multiples rear end. And the gain is pretty nice as well!"
"im almost 2 hours trying to find any excuse with C is down more than their peers, dividend, curve usd10y-usd2y,.......... its friday and nobody will hold over the weekend. Any information??????"
The dividend day postponed one more day to tomorrow.New ground may be aroused to attract more money to Citigroup.No fear. Just buy more if new high.
"Jane's plan is no plan for growth, but instead sell the international assets.Very slow share buy back to avoid stock price going up.It looks like she is working from home, babysitting her grand children."
I am amused how all the folks here who are declaring this dead suddenly change their tone when the shares jump 20%. All the complaining when you should be using this opportunity to accumulate shares at 12% below TBV.
With so much “upside” potential why can’t this stock stop moving down and sideways. I’ve seen better returns from a simple savings account. Jane and her BOD cronies had better figure out a way to get this thing moving upwards.
Looking more likely that we will hit 45 million shares for Q4 buyback. More than 2.2% of shares outstanding.
"Yes, we will see the crazy dip today or tomorrow.This is a chance to collect money with cheap price + dividend.Don't see and fear.You just buy more at cheap price.The ground would be built today or tomorrow.The rally will start."
This bank taught me that price-book and PE ratios dont mean anything at all.
"Citibank has funny history.Each time the dividend day, it will crash to the lowest price.After the dividend day, it started to go rally.I hope this time it works again.Just two days, we could buy more before the dividend day."
"It's really interesting, most stocks after very good earnings results fall below the price prior to earnings.Or 30% surprise is not enough to keep the share price above such a support?While I could understand a profit taking whet the price reach ATH, this is not a case of C, which is still more than 10% under June's high. Not to mention the fact the enviroment for banks will improve with tighter monetary policy.IMO hedge funds try to make trading stocks as much irrational as possible."
It is interesting that all Citi CEOs have been unable to turn this stock around since 2008. It makes me think that they can simply pick any dummy to be CEO or simply skipping this role to save more money to get better return. When I look at Jane F’s video and not really impressed of what she said and yet all I noticed was her filtered video that reduced her age by 20 years. LoL
Shorted 3K shares at $69.3. With a below average CEO in place. sure win!
Time to get out? Better invest somewhere else and make money.
"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/10/126_317520.html?WAFirst blow to Citi's strategic exits from consumer banking in Asia. While liquidation seems approved by BoD, it is very unlikely that it would be less cost heavy for the bank as multiple eyes watch it. Regulators and banking unions could bring more expense burden to such exit. The biggest issue is that Korean banking is not going to be sold for the right price but liquidated at expense."
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than C
anyone know what was behind this drop? seems very unusual
All major bank stocks up consistent with the overall market except one. Must be the Jane Fraser effect.
So for the 4th Quarter what is Citi buyback? They are waiting on the FEDS to approve their plan and until then I take it that there is no buyback.
"It is better than expected. Decline in FICC is much less than expected on a quarterly basis even as normalization is obvious YoY. ICG seems stable with growth both on QoQ and AoA. GCB is a drag but given the active exits will take time to stabilize performance there. North America shows improvements on economic recovery both in cards and retail which is quite welcome. International consumer is undergoing restructuring. It is hard for now to say that CEO is sleeping on a job. It will take time before investors will see some results of her efforts. Nevertheless, some visibility in trends that she is targeting could be seen in reported numbers."
I picked up a few shares today on the dip and just noticed today it went ex-div. Terrible timing but at least I know it’s temporary.
"Book value $92, it will be 120 sooner than you think.. C is not worse than WFC.By the way, I also own WFC."
Citi will make $10 EPS in 2023. Shares will be at $100 end of 2023.
"C seems to be out of favor, I think it’s a good time to get a ITM call, C should be getting a little bounce in the next weeks  cheers GLTA happy Friday"
"Citi offered $500,000 to about 1000 employees in Korean consumer business for voluntary leave and offer was rejected according to some sources. It is about 500 Mil and it is cash expense. Add to this accounting writedowns, asset fire liquidations, legal and related costs it could go up to 1 Bill and above. According to recent presentation Citi's consumer loans stood at 16.6 Bill."
"Jane and Mark - Social Justice Warriors!My gut tells me they would rather give the $1B per quarter dividend to pay back all those who have been ""wronged"" in life than to support greedy shareholders. Maybe donate the $7B from the bank sales to an ""equity relief fund"". My advice to Jane is to stay off Yahoo financial news and focus on EARNING A PROFIT!!!"
Hopefully we are witnessing a million shares being bought back here.
"""Citi limits noontime calls and meetings to fight office burnout""-Bloomberg NewsFor real????? the stocks is below TBV and these is the only news , manage needs to start working"
Dow is green and this trash is red. Tesla with a pe ratio of 280 is up 7%. Fundamentals dont mean a thing with Citi’s management
it will close at $70.40
Finally! Share count is under 2B.Now if they can work on reducing debt .....
every time she speaks it drives the share price down. what is her agenda.
DOW goes very positive!! C goes more negative!!!
