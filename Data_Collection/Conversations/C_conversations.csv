Selling non performing asset is to boost share holders values.
"Remarks by CEO Jane Fraser at Citi’s 2021 Annual MeetingI’m excited about Citi’s future.

How Paypal is not regulated amazes me. They just announced that they are getting into stock trading. They might have better lobbyists than all the banks together.
"Was the recent move up just a result of C buying back stock? If so, how artificial. A cheap floozy of a move that will soon be reversed."
End of Month profit taking and dividend payout. As long as we do not go into a correction it should continue to rise on infrastructure plan.
"Is ""plain Jane"" doing any kind of buyback? Or does the money flow out as payback to the new administration and their social justice programs? Kind of like how the LGBTQ+ flag was flying in Kabul."
"On Wednesday, this week, the minutes of the Fed's meeting following the July 27-28 meeting are expected to be published, at which two important issues were discussed: when to start reducing monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, and how quickly to reduce them.Only after solving these two pressing issues will the Fed think about when to start raising the interest rate from the current almost zero level.Strong reports from the labor market have once again strengthened the arguments in favor of the fact that the Fed will announce its intentions to start reducing the asset purchase program either at the next meeting on September 21-22 or in November."
Well nice recovery but I would avoid over 74. It's now 20 to 30x 2023 estimates imo of 2.50 to 3.75. Euphoria is taking over again. I would hold under 74 but avoid any higher.
I was hoping for a longer stay in the 60’s so I could scoop up more shares. C is now off to the races. Golden cross is developing quite nicely.
Cheapest bank. Book value is 100 dollars a share
Why do you think banks are down while a lot of other sectors are up today?Just wondering...
The 10 year rate chart wants to settle between 1.5% and 1.8% for the period over the next 4 months. Will support financials nicely.

Looks like we could get a Golden Cross here at C within the next couple weeks if the share price holds up. I am expecting a march back toward $80 short term.
Today's Citi's ex-div pay date. Got in at 3.42%. I'll take it as C ever so slowly climbs to $80 (and maybe beyond). Stay long.
"I bought 100 Citibank shares in 2007 at $500 per share for total cost $50,000. In 2010 it reverse split 1 for 10 and I ended up with 10 shares. Now I still have 10 shares at current market value $7,400. I am hoping it will someday recoup my loss. It seems I will never recoup my loss. Is there anyone out there in the same boat?????"
"Reason for most of the drop in price is Fed's ease of government buybacks, which raises the interest rates. This is good, but bad, since it means the FED sees the economy growing (just look at the earnings season). Smart money drops the stocks, waits for the market to follow and buys low. Which side are YOU on?"
"The Financial sector has confirmed to fly as my research, starting to fly in the beginning of Aug.After 3 months maintenance, Citigroup could drive to $110.After the confirmation of increase interest rate, $140 could be seen in the beginning of 2022.100%+ stock, don't care about waiting for 3 months."
