"It is going to be ""brutal winter"" for markets Jane said. It is particularly true for Citi investors in the next 4-5 months. Even in March the investor could be disappointed as it looks very likely again as with Corbat that this management is going to issue longer time guidance and targets to hit promised ""excellency"". While urgency is what the management talks about on multiple public appearances, it refuses to provide even some rough guidance on timing and execution of the strategy. In the meantime market beta kings are not going to wait for Citi Investor Day. If some selloff arrives on economy or market risk, it will wash out thin investor confidence in Citi and push market stock price down with unexpected and brutal magnitude ."
"When you look at Citi’s stock current valuation relative to its peers, relative to its capital return, relative to its projected earnings 1-3 years out this is where it stands:1) Below $77 is ridiculously cheap2) $77-$85 cheap3) $85-$90 fair value"
"This thing is such a joke. Literally no upwards movement for months. No matter what the fed, quarterly reports or anything else it’s stagnant or down."
"I believe the reason citi is negative is because today is ex- dividend,people can sell and still get dividend,which makes no sense to me,why sell when it’s way under valued!!!!!!!"
"Great….another whole idea with a 1 billion dollar social equity fund. Hey, here’s an idea…..how about doing something to boost the stoke price. It’s a crazy thought but it might make shareholders happy. That should be their woke agenda. Woke up that sleeping board room"
"I just do not know how Jane is planning to grow business in such competitive landscape even in Asia. All the strategic points in presentation that she likes to refer to are good but management does not say how to accomplish them. Still investors should give her a chance. As she exits consumer businesses around the globe, it is hard to see how she plans to grow wealth and asset management as building new customer relationships and bring more wealth and assets under management through consumer and private banking could be illusive. In corporate W&A management Citi faces fierce competition even from domestic rivals like JPM, GS and MS. It is unclear why Citi's unique global digital platform could provide competitive advantage against other US investment banks with the same technology infrastructure and higher or similar quality investment products and services. It is hard to see what Jane has in mind as competition crusher. It sounds a little ideal without disclosure of execution lines along announced strategy. It is just hard to believe that global digital platform could grow business if you do not fill it up with high quality products and services. What is unique in Citi product and service offerings that competitors do not have? In North America Citi has lost rivalry in wealth and asset management and it is unlikely the bank gains market share any time soon. There is too much of unknown and unconvincing just general statements. Even the management urgency is not communicated to shareholders in a way to improve confidence."
"Yes, we will see the crazy dip today or tomorrow.This is a chance to collect money with cheap price + dividend.Don't see and fear.You just buy more at cheap price.The ground would be built today or tomorrow.The rally will start."
every time she speaks it drives the share price down. what is her agenda.
I picked up a few shares today on the dip and just noticed today it went ex-div. Terrible timing but at least I know it’s temporary.
"MasterCard’s EPS to Grow 36% to $2.19 in Q3, Revenue to Jump Nearly 30% and Jane is saying Citi is going to crash. Citi is the largest masterCard system world wide I believe! A Citi card will almost always be a Mastercard. Citibank’s current VISA cards are the Costco Anywhere Visa Card. Come on Jane quit abusing the stockholders."
"Given the size of Citibank Korean business and using analogy of HSBC exits in the same jurisdiction shareholders could expect a cost over 1 Bill with hard to define the upper range. Standard Chartered has also been struggling with Koren business. Barclays left Korea with significant charge on my memory. Given that Citi announced that charges will be spread till 2023 it could affect operating margins for the next 2-3 years and keep operating costs higher for longer that expected. Of course revenue growth could mitigate such cost pressure leading to better operating leverage. However, at the moment both are not visible. Most likely shareholders will see strategic and execution details on 2022 Investor Day that would take at least 3-5 years before real benefits of this management transformation arrive. I do not think the management bothers itself with emergency related to shareholder return from market capitalization. Returns from increased dividend payout ratio or buybacks will provide only slight boost or at best support stock price. In my opinion the longer term risk/return ratio does not look great for Citi at the moment."
Surprisingly a word from such company like Snap could remind people that astronomic growth embedded in analyst forecasts is unlikely till real economy reopens. I just do not understand how people speculate on online advertisers and social network businesses that collect 2/3 of their revenue from advertising to grow big when real economy faces all current headwinds. At the end these companies do not produce real products and services that people need and consume. They depend on spending and capital budgets of advertiser. Why the market assigns higher valuation multiples for such businesses is a puzzle to me. The growth to value gap is just getting bigger and there is no end in sight.
Even with the wind down of these franchises- $7 billion of additional tangible common equity will be reached. There will be write downs but the end result will be positive. Keep these buybacks going while so many are confused by these headlines!!
"Who knows what happen to Citigroup?BAC is growing, but Citigroup is always downward"
This is what it looks like when the stock has little fundamental support and investor confidence. The beta kings will just game it based on momentum market trends. I doubt that current management actually cares about it. The problem is not that the stock price is falling. The problem is that investors and shareholders are left at the mercy of market momentum forces. The problem is that the discount to peers is just getting bigger. People see that and it undermines their confidence. Citi's stock price is even in low correlation with industry ETFs. It feels like it is in confidence crisis. Still management refuses to communicate transparently and clearly the status of business transformation.
The dividend day postponed one more day to tomorrow.New ground may be aroused to attract more money to Citigroup.No fear. Just buy more if new high.
"$79 before Nov 20No fear to buy and hold now.I want to buy at 68.8, seems no chance. too bad. Too strong."
Shorted 3K shares at $69.3. With a below average CEO in place. sure win!
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than C
Lucky tha Jane is buying back stock instead of raising the dividend. Just think where the stock would be trading without the buybacks.
"Just breakthrough $74, it will go to $79, then $86-90If to raise the interest rate, $120 in the beginning of 2022"
"When Jane talks... people listen! (judging by the stock price, she must not speak good things)sad, Corbat ""the dingbat"" sold SB:Smith Barney... they make money the old fashioned way... they earn it!"
"Next week the banks will be getting upgraded, that should move Citi slightly higher..."
"A lot less ""Social investing"" and a lot more ""Looking out in the interest of shareholders "" is warranted."
"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/10/126_317520.html?WAFirst blow to Citi's strategic exits from consumer banking in Asia. While liquidation seems approved by BoD, it is very unlikely that it would be less cost heavy for the bank as multiple eyes watch it. Regulators and banking unions could bring more expense burden to such exit. The biggest issue is that Korean banking is not going to be sold for the right price but liquidated at expense."
"Hey CFO ! you remember that you have an active buyback program, right?"
"So far the strategy to exit consumer businesses in 13 countries has been quite expensive and negative to Citi book value. Australian exit had 680 Mil pretax operating loss which Marc Mason said would be neutralized and 800 Mil capital released. Now Korean business has unknown cash expense spread till 2023 on exit. On top of that liquidation sale of business is unlikely to go without further writedowns and additional expenses. Investors do not know how other asset sales will eventually end up with future potential accounting and material losses. Given challenging market conditions and timing of disposals reluctant bidders could pay premiums less than original price paid by Citi for such assets. It will lead to goodwill reductions and capital losses. Even if capital released, additions to tangible equity could still be less accretive if sales occur at prices less than originally paid for such businesses. Another question is as exits progress and costs are removed from bank operations, what the tradeoff is between such cost reduction and lost revenue from sold businesses. CFO keeps saying that capital will be reinvested in higher return businesses but Citibank history shows that such investments had quite long time before they delivered actual incremental returns for example in equity or retail card businesses which are very competitive lines. Just saying that management expects 7 Bill of capital release which can be returned to shareholders is not a value proposition. Management has not transparently communicated strategic exit details and expectations to investors to estimate present value of cost of asset sales vs potential benefits. I am pretty sure top leaders have their estimates and expectations but they refuse to communicate them although it could be helpful."
"It’s been fun but I’m out. Made some great money trading Citi early in the year but this thing won’t budge. Think it will have it’s day in the sun but that’s going to be a while. I may rotate back at some point but hanging on has been painful. I like HSBC. Not buying that now, but not talked about much here - worth a look. Best."
"If Citigroup keeping the range in 70.8 - 71.8 till the end of Oct, it will have a new breakthrough in November.It would find the new high at $75-76 at least.But I hope, it could go through $80. Citigroup is undervalued for so long time."
The management knew that Korean news is negative for the market. The bank rushed to issue a statement the exits are accretive to shareholders and capital. Once again some unknown long term benefit along with return of capital has been used to calm growing investor pessimism. This management is taking its time to see what is going to happen from their strategic refresh without communicating realistic rather than general and abstract lines of better operating performance ahead and ideal excellency.
"Citibank has funny history.Each time the dividend day, it will crash to the lowest price.After the dividend day, it started to go rally.I hope this time it works again.Just two days, we could buy more before the dividend day."
"I think Citi is buying back shares today. As of Jane, I would support her for now as she needs time to clean up something deep inside bank. I agree that she is talking too much about racial equality, diversity, equal gender opportunity initiatives etc. However, having tons of political and regulatory pressure on banks she has no choice. My problem with her management style so far is simple - tons of general statements and abstract strategic presentations and little details on specific issues, nuances and execution details. Shareholders have deserved that for too long. I understand she may not communicate directly to the markets many things but the way she walks around when analysts ask plain questions is not something to like in CEO. Her CFO is even worse acting like a Harvard graduate student during class project discussion resisting to provide details and financial metrics beyond general comments."
"Citi offered $500,000 to about 1000 employees in Korean consumer business for voluntary leave and offer was rejected according to some sources. It is about 500 Mil and it is cash expense. Add to this accounting writedowns, asset fire liquidations, legal and related costs it could go up to 1 Bill and above. According to recent presentation Citi's consumer loans stood at 16.6 Bill."
Citi will make $10 EPS in 2023. Shares will be at $100 end of 2023.
"Jane and Mark - Social Justice Warriors!My gut tells me they would rather give the $1B per quarter dividend to pay back all those who have been ""wronged"" in life than to support greedy shareholders. Maybe donate the $7B from the bank sales to an ""equity relief fund"". My advice to Jane is to stay off Yahoo financial news and focus on EARNING A PROFIT!!!"
This is the last trading day in October and there is a lot of option trading and institutional rebalancing. Now the stock is going ex dividend. I am really concerned what quants could do to this stock. It is very unlikely that shareholders will get any fundamental support or at least supportive updates till the end of 2021 given management reluctance to step away from general and abstract strategy guidance. Could expected tapering change something next month? I doubt it as without some sort of reasonable guidance or transformation status update it is less likely to spur investor confidence. Even recent analyst comments show confusion and uncertainty. Few emails to shareholder relationship and investor relationship have been left unanswered since Q3 earnings call. I would recommend retail and individual shareholders keep emailing Citi for more open and transparent communication. To me the bank is clearly in confidence crisis.
"im almost 2 hours trying to find any excuse with C is down more than their peers, dividend, curve usd10y-usd2y,.......... its friday and nobody will hold over the weekend. Any information??????"
With so much “upside” potential why can’t this stock stop moving down and sideways. I’ve seen better returns from a simple savings account. Jane and her BOD cronies had better figure out a way to get this thing moving upwards.
I bought Citibank shares before 2008 Great Recession at $50 a share. Then Citibank declared 1 for 10 reverse stock split. Now my Citibank share has cost basis of $500. Unfortunately Citibank trades today at $71. I will recover my cost when Citibank goes up to $500 form $71. How do I have to wait for it yo happen???? Anyone has an idea????
There are rumors that some banks may drop out from bidding for Citi's consumer business assets due to high valuations from the seller. Also there are some regulatory restrictions on high net wroth clients in some Asian countries that could lead to lost relationship with US bank. On top of that Democrats seem to study an option of taxing stock buybacks which could make them less attractive for businesses.Today was a very strange day for Citi stock trading. It did not even recover on rise in market rates and market indexes (market beta). The rest of large bank shares performed much better.
