"I'd rather Citi bought stock back at discount to bv!, when it trades higher then raise dividend"
Looks like we could get a Golden Cross here at C within the next couple weeks if the share price holds up. I am expecting a march back toward $80 short term.
Amazing how investors lunge at the Delta bait the media is hyper-ventillating over. They apparently don't see as I do the billions of vaccines and therapeutics on the way.
C is worth $80 share today and with a 10% buyback more than $90 a share. ..
i really hope Citi is buying back shares substantially under Tangible book right now and saving over 3.1% yield per share in doing so...
Is it going to grow or will it stand still for another half a year ?
"I still support financial sector, even through the beginning of rally was destructed.I think C is very dangerous in the end of Aug, so I sell all C and buy BAC, WFC and COF.Communist China will do somethings unexpected, when the Covid-19 facts will be uncovered after 2 weeks.Be careful the Crazy China elements, they make friend with ISIS.China is unexpected crazy element to be watched."
Don't get it! Citi is expected to report earnings of $2.02/share for the quarter on July 14th. That's an increase of 304% over last year's comparable quarterSo why the pessimism?
69.69.... hehehehe
Pitiful
If you have 13 houses for sell and you get 0 offers you might need to rethink your plan.
The 10 year bond is making joke again?The best joker in 2021.
"Rami, where do you see that Citi is buying back one million shares a day?"
"When do they declare the common ""dividents""? Also, whats the over/under of Jane surprising us with an amount greater than 51 cents?"
This has been a back and forth battle between the traders that want good news now and the investors looking at fundamentals and seeing a strong case for a 20-30% return in the next 12 months.
The 10 year rate chart wants to settle between 1.5% and 1.8% for the period over the next 4 months. Will support financials nicely.
you can almost 3% holding C stock plus the capital appreciation. What can you get with a 10 yr treasury? 1.48%? ...how are treasuries a good deal? they are a rip-off. ...
Well nice recovery but I would avoid over 74. It's now 20 to 30x 2023 estimates imo of 2.50 to 3.75. Euphoria is taking over again. I would hold under 74 but avoid any higher.
There has been NO announcement that I have found at this time on Citi selling 1 of the 13 banks yet? Only thing I have read from Citi is that Fraser and Mark agreed to not give us a bigger dividend after 2 years and the stock is less then it was in 2019. So even though their numbers are looking better the stockholder have gained nothing in the last 2 years but their little dividend. So Far Fraser has done nothing for me.
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
If this comes back down to the $50's I'm backing up the truck.
"June 7th 2021, WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve announced Monday it will publish the results for both of its annual stress tests on June 24. Some folks are still talking about June 30th based on past history, but it is June 24th this year."
"Piper Sandler analyst Jeffery Harte lowered the firm's price target on Citi to $91 from $95 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares post the ""solid"" Q2 results. While shares declined after management guided expenses up for the year, the guidance is be fairly consistent with management's commentary at an industry conference last month, Harte tells investors in a research note"
"Whats the maximum dividend payout for Citi? Fed reserve website says that after June 30th banks can restore their capital plans. Long time holder of this stock. Looking at the current stock price it is clear the buybacks have done nothing for the shareholders. I'm sure it helped Corbat and the other execs achieve their internal targets ($$$$ in their pockets not ours). Anyway, I would like to see the dividend increased to the maximum allowable. I think the fed has allowed 35% payout ratio from the other banks. Citi is probably able to make $8 / year now. So that would seem to imply a $0.70 cents maximum quarterly dividend which would be a little over 4% yearly at the current price. Maybe a decent dividend would better support the stock price. So far I am not impressed by the new CEO."
Forget the buy-backs just the dividends please.Citi bought back a billion over the past years and it did nothing to enhance value of the shares.
17 weeks and Fraser has not received one contract on 1 Bank out of the 13 to sell? JPMorgan still has 3 CEO's. Not too late to make one of them an offer.
paypal worth $341B ... interesting ...
The 10 year rate will be higher in 6 months. I see 1.8% year end. Citi will trade above its TBV at that point. Year end $82.
what time are earnings today
market providing joe the support after the agfa fiasco
A combination of such buyback program (with shares below TBV) together with an already good dividend payment will highly benefit shareholders long term. GLTA
"And just think Citi finished top of the four big banks today, accidents will happen. I see they took the money out of their cash accounts to pay all the different types of dividends for the Quarter."
$71.50 today?
"Remarks by CEO Jane Fraser at Citi’s 2021 Annual MeetingI’m excited about Citi’s future. We have many attributes as a bank that distinguish us—our global mindset… our ability to anticipate where our industry is heading… our empathy, which gives us deeper insight into our clients.And we are determined to leverage these advantages to close the gap with our peers and improve returns for our shareholders.As a shareholder I'm waiting!!!"
Federal Reserve announces new capital ratios for large banks starting Oct 1 2021...News just release after closing
First stop 80
Apart of the large dump this morning it looks as there are lots of buys - could you see the same? Actually it looks as holding better than other banks. What do you see?
Today is a day for Citi to buy back 2 million shares.
Love this stock! Cheap shares now will payoff big league in the future.
"Who would have thought on a red day across the markets, this thing is green?"
"Goldman Sachs doesn't believe we're undervalued, given the trading rev expectation and higher than anticipated expenses"
"Hopefully, today's Baron's article that most banks will increase dividends by 10% holds true for Citi. Maybe we'll know around 4:30?Heard on Bloomberg this morning, that hedge funds aren't buying banks, but if they get involved, SPs will increase nicely."
"Zero reaction to buyback, zero reaction to dividends, something strange is happening ...."
"if C stock is very undervalued then the smart thing to do is use the excess capital to buy back stock. doesn't that make sense? provided it is as undervalued as ceo believes it to be, the company is doing the right thing. would love extra money in my pocket - but that will come through capital appreciation...patience"
"Well it looks like my $75 covered calls I sold might earlier could hit this Friday :/I rolled them into next Friday, Aug 20 to $77.Any ideas on the odds of them being alright?"
This is the last time we are gonne see 73 hopefully
"But Citi made it clear that it wants to put every incremental dollar into stock buybacks with the stock at such an inexpensive price. I think that’s 100% the right move.”Citi is the only major bank trading below tangible book value. The stock was off 1%, to $70.75 in Tuesday morning trading, below tangible book value of around $75 a share."
Citi will be the only one of the big bank buying back more of its shares under TANGIBlE book value. Amazing! On top of that each share it buys back will eliminate nearly a 3% yield!
"The financial sectors have benefit with the stimulus. The banking stocks should go rally, no reason to drop.The 10 year yield is still strong and going rally."
I just added some shares. Too good an opportunity to pass up. Good luck!
Farmer Jim (aka Mr. Financials) just bought Citi during the Halftime Show and said he's giving it a big bear hug. Nice bump after he said it at 12:59. He's loved on the CLF boards.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Rightpicker.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"last time I saw this happen before earnings, the insiders knew ahead of time. hope not"
The 10 year just hit 1.15% and the financial stocks are holding well. This is a good sign. It shows most negativity about the financial sector is close to an end.
Cheapest bank. Book value is 100 dollars a share
Nothing but stock index option expirations and passive index funds. Quantitative risk trading is moving the markets this summer week. Fund Volume to individual component securities ratio is quite high which is a clear indication what rules the market today and last week.
"Joking aside, although it is fun, which you kind of have to laugh at to stay sane here - I probably wouldn’t worry too much about this one over the longer-term regardless of what Michael Rlulz is saying around annual earnings of 2 or 3 or something ridiculous. If that’s what I thought, I don’t know how you’d call this a keeper at any level. Maybe it’s like in cost accounting, how much does something cost? Answer, how much do you want it to cost? Anyways…capital distributions are back, the bar is low for smug Jane (talking about how mothers should be more like her), and all you really need here are higher interest rates / treasury yields. Yield goes up, this goes up. If not, you keep buying back at lower share prices so when it does, more to earnings. Seems simple right? The smart people that work at these banks just jump one to the other. It’s Coke and Pepsi. We’re not talking about technology companies here where you have to keep some real competitive advantage through ideas and patents. It’s nothing but risk management."
0.8B in the bank... nice... Consolidate operation is a good for the long run...
Some positive highlights from presentation. Citi TTS business is doing quite well even in such uncertain times and the operating expenses are at the low end of 11.2-11.6 Bill forecast. I think that on expense side they manage bank expenses pretty tight even with increase in investment spend and that is good. However I am not sure that operational expense in Q2 is indicative of run rate cost associated with compliance and risk control improvements. It could be that investment spend plans particularly in technology are more heavily redirected to the second half. Anyway expense line really surprised. Lets see what Jane says.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Need to keep buying back at least 1 million shares a day until $75. What a gift that buybacks happening at this level!
Book value is $90. C is stuck in a low valuation range - for how long?
looks like the banks have bottomed .... expect tough comparisons to last years quarter but very solid earnings. plenty of cash generated for buybacks too. not sure why all the negativity. a temporary lull in rates is ok. it is lazy days of summer after all.
I’m 6 days TBV= $78. Will wake some people up to this valuation.
Wells more than 3.6 %BAC-more than 3%Goldman - 3.5 %Our favorite Citigroup barely collected 2 %!!! What kind of grain ? So every time!
"Think C just needs to get out of the limelight.Last few weeks has just had too many events.The only one positive is the dividend announcement soon.Then, we just have to wait for other sectors to report and banking sector to quietly go about their business.I guess we still have analysts' downgrades to come."
"Citi's stock alpha is hardly to play out till early 2022. Jane said that at the planned investor day the management to issue updated target strategy metrics for accountability and transparency. Until that time Citi is a Market Perform stock and very unlikely to deliver specific positive outcomes to shareholders. It will be traded on macro trends and market beta basis. Although the earnings call revealed some strategic details and near term operational trends, it failed to provide basic roadmap to ""Excellency"" tag that top management likes to communicate publicly. It feels that the team is still working on strategy update while bank heads to exit from consumer businesses and invests in more efficient technology and grow new business lines. There is no indication of current status on transformation, duration of mandatory investment cycle and expected return from such actions."
"Sell on news, even good news from JPM"
Only negative part may be they used loss reserved capital that didn't materialize to boost profits. We never know how the market might react. This is why the buyback is relative I'd think.
It is scary that Citi may get approval to trade bit coin. Former Citi employee here and they will find a way to turn this into another Citi debacle and take huge losses and fines as a result. I was starting to feel positive about Citi until I saw this article.
$78 tangible book value looking at digitization leading to massive cost cutting. Buy the lights out below $70.
Not finding an easy way to put lipstick on this oinker today.
2nd q NI=6.19 b$. It is 2.85 $/shrthose figures decrease to 3.79 b$ = 1.74 $/shr when one time reserve release is out.assume we make a very simple extrapolation to 12 months and we'll ve normalized earnings of 1.74x4= 6.98 $/y/shr.consider now a p/e of 12 (best in class as jpm) and you get the MAXIMUM PRICE of c under today low nii. This is around 80$. If we reach 80 or so (not easy) i'm out.gl
What is the strategy of announcing the sell the banks in 13 counties and then not sell one a quarter. Why would you do that if you didn't make a deal with the Fed's and your not increasing you buyback to anything of value. Buying 40 million share back doesn't do anything as we could see from this past quarter. They couldn't even get back to above $80 from 2019. Citi is not an investment its an anchor and with inflation its losing money. Citi sold for $50 per share in 2011 and 10 years later its $67. That's a bad joke. The Bank is more valuable by closing its door and sell everything out. If the bank is worth $483.14 per share I would be more then happy to take $240 per share and sell it all out ASAP. Just part it all out.Now the Feds can fine someone else to screw.
ok. ER week.End of week prediction.I'll go first.$64
I was hoping for a longer stay in the 60’s so I could scoop up more shares. C is now off to the races. Golden cross is developing quite nicely.
"Amazing that a company like Gamestock(GME) that hasn't, isn't, and probably won't make any money sells for $160/share while one of the biggest, profit making banks in the world , C, doesn't even sell for 1/2 that price."
"Citigroup Inc. was the lone megabank not to increase its dividend, keeping it unchanged at 51 cents but leaving the door open for an increase. It didn’t announce a new buyback plan. Its stock, already trailing the other big bank gains this year, fell after hours nearly 1%"
Goldman surprised a lot. Given expectations for market trading normalization the across the board declines in Goldman market trading is quite big compared to last year and reported by JPM. It seems that normalization in capital markets is having bigger impact on investment banks with larger revenue share in capital market.
Green day on first day of the second half.. looks promising.. 120..
"It is still at 0.78 price/book, incredibly cheap compared to JPM"
"Yes, we blame Citigroup has no rally for nearly 3 months.If you are long term trader, you know Citigroup worth $200 in the end of 2022.What's you feeling now?"
At the start of the 19 week Citi has a contract for 1 of the banks in the 13 countries to be sold off. Australia second largest bank is buying Citi retail and card business and is scheduled to close in March if all goes well. Congration to Jane Fraser the CEO. Now you have 12 more countries to go.
"I completely agree with some people that credit card business has matured and could be slowing. The evidence is quite obvious as issuers offer multiple perks to customers like free air miles, travel and food discounts, cashbacks, welcome points etc. Clearly competition is intense but I also suspect market capacity for consumer loan demand has reached economic equilibrium. People tend to refuse maintain higher balances on which issuer earns interest thanks to government assistance. Structural demand shift from demographic trends toward tech and application based solutions and services also weigh on bigger credit card usage. However, economic cycles have also had impact on consumer credit growth. Historically growth led to higher utilization of credit by consumers and contraction led to diminished credit demand. This time is different as we have massive liquidity flows and government financial support for consumers which in my memory never happened before. The long term data on consumer credit outstanding is somewhat mixed but still trending slightly higher."
"well I think investors compare banks. and tbh citi is at the bottom for them. jpm is a crown jewel, so is Bank of America. sometimes things are cheap for a reason, look at Japanese stocks. this thing has sat for 50-80 for a decade, its not getting split for parts. like this board sound like wanting blackberry to be valued like apple. citi makes a profit sure, but at some point bond yields will be on par with citi stock, and what would you rather own, a bond from apple or citi stock thats dependent on fed rates."
"Every investor, every mutual fund and anybody on this planet, at this time and at this price, should be snatching up shares of Citi. Because Citi can only go in one direction."
"Hey guys, Decided to join the party.With the stress test today, out of all financials, Citigroup has the lowest P/EOne of the highest Earnings per shareOne of the highest dividend payouts , one of the lowest payout ratio. Not to mention they are well diversified outside of just loans.Out of all financials in the US.... felt like I rather spent the little extra $$$ and get C over BAC.Plan is to start with 100 shares, sell Covered calls OTM with a low delta ( less chances of shares getting assigned) and see what happens next. Cannot wait for the stress test and for Citi to announce by how much they will be increasing their dividend payout."
End of Month profit taking and dividend payout. As long as we do not go into a correction it should continue to rise on infrastructure plan.
"Once Citigroup go pass $71, we could confirm the rally path in the beginning.The 10 year bond trying to go up, no matter the DOW 30 dropping.This is HOPE"
$75 by August.
Today's Citi's ex-div pay date. Got in at 3.42%. I'll take it as C ever so slowly climbs to $80 (and maybe beyond). Stay long.
Citi plans to grow client assets by 150 Bill in the next few years. Of course bigger part of such will come in from China and Hong Kong. They are hiring people for wealth management in Asia. Given deterioration in US China relationship and no improvement on the horizon I wonder how the bank could reach such goal. China's crackdown on technology is also denting underwriting pipeline and wealth growth through capital market channels. At the moment it seems that capital spend on talent and infrastructure could take longer to deliver real benefits given uncertainty on US China political and economic prospects. Could it be that the the timing of strategic push into Asian wealth business turns out to be expensive decision in such competitive industry?
$55 after the earnings
Great numbers! 40 million shares repurchased!! TBV of $78!

C goes ex div in about 2 weeks.
"Industry leader JPMorgan Chase (JPM) could see its dividend increase to $1 a share from 90 cents, producing a yield of 2.6% at its share price of $154. The payout at Bank of America (BAC) might advance to 22 cents a quarter from 18 cents for a 2.1% yield, and Citigroup's (C) dividend could rise to 56 cents from 51 cents a quarter for a 2.2% yield, Goldberg estimates."
Keep accumulating... 120 year end.
The news you are reading about did not come from Citi or any bank. Citi has not released any news since 6/24 on this years dividend or buybacks. This groups is trying to get you to sell your stock. They will not announce anything until after closing June 29. Stock buyback starts July 1 due to the Feds rules.
"Reason for most of the drop in price is Fed's ease of government buybacks, which raises the interest rates. This is good, but bad, since it means the FED sees the economy growing (just look at the earnings season). Smart money drops the stocks, waits for the market to follow and buys low. Which side are YOU on?"
"While Citi is attractively priced at the moment for new entrants, short volume in XLF jumped during the last week or so. Increased short interest in such product should put pressure on the price of it's components. Given extremely high quantitative nature of liquidity trading in ETF products generally, XLF could be used as a timing tool for human traders. For investors it should be prudent to wait for more material company related announcements."
"I wasn’t sure it was real but a trial convinced me, I’m grateful sir, he’s one of the only legit trader on WhatsApp with good platform and great strategy thank you so much Grey for all you did, you can contact him via WhatsApp +1 (217) 271‑4730"
GS was so hated. Now it doubled. I see C in 120..
"The banking stock sleeping for two months, but I find that the real dip may be appeared in the beginning of Aug(May be Aug 6). And then all the bank stocks will go rally to 100% on March 2022."
Jamie Dimons Crew and BlackRock can sniff out a buck hidden under a penny and they are buying Citi. You may want to think about that.
thank god they had blow out earnings..i shutter to think of where we would be if they missedThe market is run on fears and rumors. Earnings mean nothing anymore
If you have a 2-3 year timeline you accumulate below $70. In 2 weeks TBV will be announced at $79. In this state of the economy and rising interest rates we are at the price floor.
"Is ""plain Jane"" doing any kind of buyback? Or does the money flow out as payback to the new administration and their social justice programs? Kind of like how the LGBTQ+ flag was flying in Kabul."
"The Financial sector has confirmed to fly as my research, starting to fly in the beginning of Aug.After 3 months maintenance, Citigroup could drive to $110.After the confirmation of increase interest rate, $140 could be seen in the beginning of 2022.100%+ stock, don't care about waiting for 3 months."
$78 TBV. Citi is just plainly undervalued.
"nail bitting day tomorrow, c with it's blunders and mishaps, hopefully the fed won't block the buy backs and dividend increase"
it's sad what has happened to the banks over the years. in 2003 Citibank value was $ 513.00 !!!!
Most unappreciated stock and has the best potential. Only bank I know that trades below book
"I am long this #$%$ I never learn. Jane and Mark never fail to disappoint. Horrible public relations and communications. Analysts asked them about GSIB surcharge, etc. One would think they would answer by saying that selling the 13 market banks will lower the surcharge. Instead... nothing."
Smooth sailing to 120..
RSI 32.77 I hope funds will start buying
"Smart move, buy coal power plants and close them down, now that makes a lot money. Does Citi managment not understand that they are suppose to make a profit!!! Let governments buy coal plants and shut them down not financials."
Citibank gets no respect from Wallstreet

"In order for Citi to move up its CEO has to be functional and do something positive, Stockholders are still waiting to see if Fraser should be CEO, she has cleaned house but so far that is all that we have seen their. Stock has fallen 4 to 13 percent behind the other 3 large banks (BAC, JPM, WFC) in the last 90 days, that's not positive. No sign of any bank contract from the 13 countries that she announce that they would sell the retail banking and credit card side out in the past 18 weeks. She enjoyed her trip to London, whatever that means. I am sure if I was making 18 million per year I could enjoy my time in London also. Her communications skills seem to be a little on the down side at this point and time and if she says nothing then news teams will start making up their own story and it will get ugly fast. It looks like Citi stress test rates dropped from 2020 but know official words from her or the CFO! Short term Citi fail behind the other large banks Friday by 1 to 2 percent in one day. Now that is flat ugly. At this rate, I do not see her lasting past the end of the year. That would project out to 12 to 30 percent drop behind the other three banks in less than 1 year. That is not acceptable."
"All the banks dropped today with over 2% GS JPM BAC -- I think the traders call it ""rotation"" they take the money out from an industry and they move it to another with just to look for other long investors to skim"
"I bought 100 Citibank shares in 2007 at $500 per share for total cost $50,000. In 2010 it reverse split 1 for 10 and I ended up with 10 shares. Now I still have 10 shares at current market value $7,400. I am hoping it will someday recoup my loss. It seems I will never recoup my loss. Is there anyone out there in the same boat?????"
"So Corbat was doing nothingFraser trying to downsize.Corbat raised dividendFraser stopped increasing dividend.Now what has Fraser done that is good for the stockholders?Starting a Black Bank is a Racist thing to do, would you start a white bank, I hope not. Banks are equal for everyone. They should have learned that in 2009-2011 lawsuits that they lost.Now why would you announce your going to sell retail banks in 13 countries and not sell 1 in 15 weeks. Corbat sold Smith Barney the wealth Management group and now Fraser is selling retail out. What's the next CEO going to sell out, not much left.Maybe they can just put it in receivership and sell the whole thing out in parts. The FEDS and stockholders should love that if the company is worth $483 per share. I will be more than happy to take 1/2 that $240 per share. Is anyone against that,it beats $50 -$60."
FINWARD BANK (FNWD). Stock $44Scheduled to earn $5.40 this year and $6 next. Stock is 7x earnings and 6x cash flow. Much better BS than Citibank and. hard to buy big position but worth it as it can easily double in 12 months. 25% growth rate next 2 years
"RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy reiterated an Outperform rating and $73.00 price target on Citi (NYSE: C) following recent updates to estimates.RBC Capital revised full-year 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates to $9.08 and $8.27 from $9.14 and $8.65, respectively, to reflect recent company guidance and latest expectations of the company's performance."

"Every day it's the same , first it grows, then it flies down, and so all banks have some kind of lawlessness , when will this mockery end ? Why are banks not allowed to grow ?"
I have a Core position and adding more under $70. Financial stocks will continue to do well during free-money era (thru liberal investments in revenue assets). When interest rates rise - their Lending profits will rise. Buy in tranches (100 sh for me). Use weekly options for immediate income. Enjoy 2.8% Dividend from Core Holdings. Citi is gonna be around for a while.
"3 news from C in 30min, sell of the Venezuelan arm and 2 product launces digital & ""free trade"" ... Would it be enough for a change in fortunes ?"
looks like y’all were trying to make a quick buck…. C tangible book value is 77.86 or around there and book value is 88-89 dollars C is currently the only Bank stock or financial stock trading at 8-9 pe every other competitor is at a 12-13 pe. C if they keep earning like they have been will have a forward pe of 3-4 at current prices in order to reach the current pe of 8-9 they need to have a stock value of atleast 90 dollars. these are just simple calculations anyone can make. Citigroup is expanding lending and exposure to investment banking across the world and in developing countries rolling out crypto transactions and digital payment methods. Citigroup is by far one of the most undervalued underdogs in this market
Banks won't announce their buyback and increased dividend plans until Monday at 4:30. A nice dividend increase has a better chance of moving the SP needle than buybacks.
"The Crazy Powell playing fire.I am scare all bank rise 10-15%, and all sectors drop to 20-30% on one day.The 10 year bond is hotter than the SUN."
Citi will reach $150 in few months with out any doubt
Powell needs to go. He said absolutely nothing today. He did not give any numbers. No targets for employement. No dates. Just confusion. I would love a job without goals. This is a political theater. It is a shame.
"If you are concerned, wait at least until 72..But I long C until 100...."
"Whatever Jane said in prepared statement is not valid. It is clear to me that The Fed has still issues with Citi. The increase in capital buffer has something to do with historic operational mistakes, weaker operational efficiency, cost of hedges and probably high exposure to credit card and consumer market. I think Citi did not ask for dividend increase and preferred stock buybacks in their capital plan. However the bank does not report stock buyback size for the next 4 quarters. It could well be that stock repurchase plans stay also at the current run rate. I understand that company politics and culture along with industry standards prevent Jane to say more particularly when the team is in the midst of strategy update. It is typical for a standard banker but Citi shareholders deserve deeper insight. They have simply been too long in uncertainty surrounding Citi. To me it is quite concerning that we have another CEO insider who may underdeliver on her promises and visions."
Can we close at $66?
"Here's a quiz. For the last 5 years, what percentage of the year has Citigroup traded BELOW tangible book value?A) 85%+B) 50-85%C) less than 50%And in followup. How long do shareholders tolerate this from their ""leadership""?"
Buybacks at below TBV will be a nice boost to EPS. It will take a few months for the market to build confidence in Citi’s ability to transition and at least cheap buybacks will be the near term advantage here.
"C should move up after earnings from this level. JPM is moving up today, why not C? C earnings should be good, no surprises. Future looks solid. What do you think?"
No fear for double checking the bottom.I think $67 is the solid ground.And we are looking forward to $100 with the FED changing mind to raise the interest rates.Strongly buy and hold.
at this ultra-discounted price this is probably the only bank stock that worth to buy in a overvalued market
What exactly is the matter with Citi stock?
Selling non performing asset is to boost share holders values.
infrastructure bill will be passed. It will be good for banks (for helping business.)
Citi isn't CPK or BP thats for sure.

Share holders of Citigroup 
"After economy recovery, PE of 12 for C ==> 120.."
Pushing $75 before earnings. Don’t see the point of raising dividends just because the Fed says it ok. Keeping cash and liquid balance sheet is more prudent and smart going into 2022. CEO should be praised for not following suit.
I think TBV will hit $78 tomorrow.
"Another view of the dividend issue. I'm looking at Fidelity. They say the market median is 2.33%. We are currently about 2.93%. So maybe we were already higher (percentage) than the rest, and they are catching up with their announcements. Yeah, it's a weak argument. We'd all rather see a commitment to a higher dividend. JPM's raise to $1/quarter is still only bringing them to 2.58%, for one example."
"Citi is a toast for the short term. high/mid 50s within 10 days, then 60s for sometime, then take off (maybe by the EoY, if new management gets it right)"
It's time to hire a real CEO with experience that knows how to Run a Financial Operation and has the ability to talk to shareholders. It is apparent that she lacks these skills and Stockholders don't need another 10 year of trying to train a CEO and fail like Corbat did. Don't need to give her a year to screw things up worse then Corbat did. CFO Mark already said that they are not going to return money to stockholders unless they can't figure out anyplace else to invest it.
Many friends losing 10%.Is it could continue with the controlling low 10 year bonds
"What is C's authorized buyback capacity, starting July 1st?"
"Again very respected numbers for JPM this morning regardless of initial market reaction. While markets revenues is almost 28% below year over year, it is still better than 38% forecast issued by executives a month ago. In consumer& community banking JPM rocks again in my opinion as revenue rises even with slowdown in loans and higher savings and deposits. Net income Markets&services are weaker as expected on normalization in markets mostly in fixed markets. Margin pressures still persist on low rates and lower loan balances. Given JPM industry leadership It is most likely that Citi may show worse results in Q2 as the bank sees higher expense run rate with unspecified time duration and decline in both ICC and GCB revenues."
"The CEO should raise the stock price of C,C is the most undervalued big Banks stock. Its price is lower than book value.If C value is equal to JPM, it price should be over $100."
Citi hires based on the color of skin. I just found that out after hearing about a lawsuit. Sorry but I'm selling my shares.
Wow- that 10 year rate is shooting back up. Back to $68 today??
Solid buying opportunity here. I’m in. Good investment now for next 3 months or 3 years. GL
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
There's no such thing as easy money but buying C here comes pretty close.Come to papa.
If we can get the 40 million shares bought back at $68 instead of $80 that a $500 million savings over 8 weeks! Keep buying back aggressively below $70 Citi!
All other banks went up more than this shill
"Seems like Citi is moving prudently. First , they plan to buy back 150million shares of stock. Hopefully this brings the share price up to a respectable level . When shareholders see some substantial appreciation finally, then, they'll work on increasing the dividend.This is the way it should be done. Expecting Citi to have a great year."
Don't know what their buy back is but appears to be maybe a stock or two every so often. Big Deal!!
Why the sudden drop in AH?I didn’t see any news
Keep buying back those shares!!

Some how Citi always finds a way to beat estimates but it never does much for its stock price.
Karen Finerman named C as her Final Trade on Fast Money today; sees near-term upside. FWIW.
These daily crashes are so dissapointing
This should be up like WFC today
Citi goes down the most and comes back the slowest. A Hostel buyout would be great.
Buying banks is the right trade all the way to year end.
"Buffet owns BAC, BK, USB, and WFC. With C selling under tangible book I wonder by he wouldn't be buying some?"
"They just failed, no increase on dividend or increase on buyback. Another Corbat with a better tap dance. Time to move on."
"Could jump 10% easily. $77,85 tbv? Are you kidding me?"
"You guys need to put 2 and 2 together. Look at what Mark Mason said during the last presentation and what caused stock to drop from 79 to 67, with small recovery afterwards. Expenses are ballooning, revenue comps are not good for markets, as long interest rates at bottom - TTS can not make money, Consumer is paying up for credit card debt - earning power is clipped. Not showing rise in dividends is just another sign of weakness and you will see this weakness reflected in earning report mid July. Lower valuation is there for a reason and Citi transformation is not going to show results any time soon(according to Jane\Mark) so the best hope is rise in interest rates which might happen in few few months. Good chances you will be able to pick up shares in lower 60s sometime in July."
Just made a video on why Citigroup is a good buy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lVvbAf64fI&ab_channel=SafeInvesting-increasing increase rates makes their loans more profitable-20 year interest rate and bank stock price correlation-very good dividend compared to BAC or Fargo-fantastic earnings-lower than prepandemic pricing...-can't go wrong with citi

The plummeting yield on the 10 year is not helping at the moment.
"this stock has double bottomed (short term) at the 66/67 level. I say it will eventually track upward, not drop into the 50's as predicted by the pundits. Just my opinion."
"Now that Citi looks good what will Jane say at 10:00, I hope Buyback and Dividend increase."
C is the cheapest big banks... BUY BUY BUY
Better hurry if you want the $.51 dividend. Buy 100 shares and you could treat yourself to a humdinger of a steak then sit back and watch your new purchase hopefully appreciate. Sound good?
"Did anyone catch Wells Fargo Banking Analyst, Mike Mayo, this afternoon on CNBC talking about bank stocks? He's such a cheer leader, saying banking stocks could go up 70% in the next 3 years, once they hit peak efficiency. He said something about Citi making a big announcement in a couple months, but didn't elaborate. Any idea what he may be eluding too? Seemed like a slip of tongue."
I heard about C the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Can Citigroup turn things around?
"The fed inflates away debt, gives money to banks, banks use money to buyback stock. Bank share holders get money from everyday people. This is not a political statement, just the way it works. Why would you not want to own banks in this situation?"
"What pies with cabbage, C-get together and go back to the price above 80, there is your minimum cost. Monday is a hard day , get up from your knees and go to growth!"
Is Citigroup going to get up from its knees ?
wow...good for MS. here is hoping we get at least an increase to .60
"US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is accused of corruption due to the fact that she received $ 7.2 million in ""speaking fees"" only from Citi Bank and the Citadel hedge fund. ""Since most of America was blocked in 2020, these speeches were almost all in Zoom, made from her home. Just $ 7.2 million, "" says Bruce Fenton, who has been involved in bitcoin for a long time. Yellen's official limited disclosure shows that she has received millions more from other banks, such as Barclays, BNP, UBS and others.This indicates that her incentives are completely inconsistent, because her state salary is only $ 221,400 a year, while Citi alone paid her more than $ 7 million. Moreover, although this amount may seem like a small amount for an open bribe, Yellen's fortune is estimated at $ 20 million, so just one bank gave her almost half of her own capital in a year."

Fraser in not showing any value add up to this point. It's been 18 weeks and no contract on any banks in the 13 countries. JPM still has 2 CEO's looking for a new Job.
"Long time ago Citi like bank with uneven and probably worse in class performance among large rivals would have been a purchase target by stronger competitor. It could be a better alternative today for shareholders and investors. Unfortunately, Fed restrictions and industry regulatory landscape prevent such move leaving very narrow options for market activists."
From 2019 to now they increased their cash by 184 billon dollars. Now how many shares will they buy back? Will know on the 14th.
"It is understandable that some in retail crowd searching for short speculative trade to make a buck or two are eagerly waiting for Citi capital plan announcements today. Expectations are that the stock will pop up along with other banks and bank ETFs on positive news. The biggest risk is possible restrictions that could be placed on Citi be regulators. Just to remind these people that Citi is still operating under certain restrictions from consent order, still in the stage of large investment spend to fix expensive technology deficiencies and still working to update strategy and execution plans. Declining revenue, income and most likely RTCE could place some limits on bank willing to return capital to shareholders. Overall there is some chance that Citi could surprise markets by releasing capital plans below what investors were guided to and expect. Additionally it is quite rational to expect some selloff in financial ETFs as overall industry still faces uncertainty regarding market revenue, NIM and loan growth outlook."
"Junior bankers at Citi are burnt out and will get a salary increase. Housing in racial communities will have access to mortgage funding. Veterans have privileged terms to credit cards, savings rates, checking accounts, mortgage and loan facilities. It is great but what about shareholders and long term investors who are also burnt out by executive mismanagement for years. Not surprising that costs are rising and revenue is shrinking. It is hard to understand what the new CEO is doing. I hope that playing politics and increased costs will lead to better operating leverage. So far investors do not see it."
How Paypal is not regulated amazes me. They just announced that they are getting into stock trading. They might have better lobbyists than all the banks together.
Is the idea to make the share price go down so they can buy more?
"Citi’s minimum regulatory requirement under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) will remain unchanged at 10.0%. As of the first quarter of 2021, Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.8% under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.The minimum is 10.5% …….. Fraser what are you doing. And why."
"I don’t want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I can’t help to wonder with all the government debt being pilled on like there’s no tomorrow, they can’t afford the treasury yields being too much higher. I can’t help to wonder, if the government officials in the back rooms are telling the Fed they need to keep these rates low so the US government doesn’t default."
"Jane s got a underpromise over deliver thing going on. looks like she s going to upgrade the bank infrastructure and get employees happy with a flex schedule and pay rises. happy employees, better performance. this is similar to the stellar job Mary Barra did at gm. will it take a couple of years? sure . but it will work."
"I have a dream, Nasdaq dropping 1000+Citigroup go rally 10%+I think the dream is coming to truth.But today Nasdaq drops not more than 500, Citigroup go rally not more thank 1 %."
Will go to 55$ by year end…
"Was the recent move up just a result of C buying back stock? If so, how artificial. A cheap floozy of a move that will soon be reversed."

"Hello! I want to remind you that it is American banks that are becoming the main beneficiaries of QE from the Fed, and here is one interesting observation! In 2008, the Fed's balance sheet was $ 1 trillion. and during that crisis, the City's shares fell to $ 10. By the beginning of the crisis in 2020, the balance was 4 trillion. and the City then fell to $ 40. And now the Fed's balance sheet is already more than $ 8 trillion! So why should the City fall so much if it also has the best P/E among the major US banks?"
They had some interesting insights about C on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"DOW 30 breakthrough 35000 to the new high, we should buy more bank stocks now.The rally will start.I think DOW 30 could go to 37000, the 10 year bond has developed the ground. so Citigroup will fly. Normally, Citigroup requires 3 months to take a break, and then go rally 100%+ for 6-8 months.In 2021 winter, the FED could not avoid to increase interest rate. And normally 5 times increasing interest rate in 2022. Citigroup could rise 12-18 months long period after this 3 months break.So, In the end of 2022, Citigroup could raise to $200. (We have not calculate the dividend revenue.)In the most aggressive mode, 3-4% interest rate to balance the 6% 10 year bonds. The value of Citigroup will be $250+ according to the history.This is the reason why Hedge Funds start to buy Citigroup, even it looks so boring for 3 months."
will this get back to 80?
Waste time over a decade.
"SA 7/22/2021: ""If Fraser can deliver a permanently elevated ROTCE - Return on average monthly tangible common shareholders' equity - after restructuring (going into higher margin activities, e.g., Wealth Management Expansion and exiting low ROE markets), and if we get any help on rates, C could trade well over $90 a share."" Net income of $14b 1st half of 2021 and that included $6.3B reserve release. They are conservatively holding a lot more in reserve for a recession, and may gradually take that back into income."
80 in no time by end of mnth i reccon
Some analysts said citi will be 120 I don’t believe but possible
Ready for $100?
"At least when you buy shares there’s less to sell. If you can’t increase demand, which obviously there isn’t much, at least they are knocking out some supply. Geez."
I'm just glad the stock isn't getting crushed. I'll take it.
Forward PE of 8 with a solid economy. You buy and wait.
"glad I sold it, and happy that I purchased 20 (contracts) puts. I prefer holding puts, not the stock. Last Friday got puts on one of the Nasdaq's ""high flyer"", couldn't be happier, ""in the money"" already.

"yeah a bunch of peoples reactions on here are kinda funny to read. it sounds like alot of you are begging for this to double1.) rates are going negative. the monthly and 2 year bonds real rates are negative. its only a matter of time before it hits the 10 year and 30 year. and after the uk told HSBC and lloyds to brace for negative rates, Im not holding out for this gift of higher rates everybody believes. maybe in 20 years we hit 7% but im not stupid enough to believe it hits 4% in 2 years like some people here. 4% would blow up the economy 2.) There is no growth in the industry, unless citi starts branching out into more consumer checking accounts to take share away from wells or jp Morgan its basically dead money. 3.) alot of you guys should look into fintech charters. I don't believe in this whole fintech craze, but this fintech charter was proposed to allow fintechs to accept deposits and access fed tools without much oversight or regulation. it was basically a stab in the heart to banks. theres a lawsuit playing out right now about who has the right to grant bank charters. whether its the state or other bodies. so do your homework4.) again do your homework. theres a thousand other places to park money and a bunch of you are banking on freaking citi to save you. smh."
Citi couldn't increase their dividend... It's all ready a 2.85% Yield. The best thing they could do is repurchase shares.... The shares are trading at less than book.... We shareholders will be better off in the long run.
C got downgraded before the ER. Interesting!!
C appears to be headed to 64 1/2-65 area. Will be helped by an over all softer DOW.
"Relax, you are going to get your div increase and buyback info but on the July 14th, not today"
Do you think Citigroup will rise to 74 in August ?
This is my response to Danill about our Janet Yellen receiving huge amount of speaking fees from Citibank. We are so fool to believe thatHow our federal officials are impartial in rendering their decisions. I am so mad at myself that I am stockholder of this bank
inflation is true. Interest rate will rise eventually. Banks going up higher.
C is up 32% the past 12 months and people are still complaining on this board
slowly City buy itself to 120.
$120 is the target.
While banks are 1 to 2 percent chip stocks are up 5 to 6 percent and Automotives ar up 3 to 4 percent. Like normal banks are missing the boat.
Citi's recent drop equals the power of HFTs on our market. They have to be more tightly regulated.
SAN is cheap as a global bank with strong presence in UK. C and SAN are both top recovery stocks.

Citibank will be posting new 52 week highs before New YearsVery undervalued. Solid business. World economy good.
This guy makes me laugh. Always the most optimistic amongst the analystsOppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski assigned a Buy rating to Citigroup (C – Research Report) today and set a price target of $114.00. The company’s shares closed last Tuesday at $68.37.
Citigroup to sell Australian consumer banking unit to National Australia Bank and Venezuela operations to BNC. I can't understand why Fraiser can't sell all these banks overnight to whatever bank makes an offer just to make all of her investors happy. She should just throw DD out the window. LOL

"I think C is the IBM of the tech world. Should be going bonkers in the line if their in, their peers always do well, but no matter how many shares they buy back, it just sits there growing fungus."
"citigroup can purchase back 14% of their outstanding shares kinda insane , but are they really going to buyback that much maybe. they definitely can if they want to"
Aug 3 is the first day to start the rally according to the calendar.This is marked 3 months maintenance. We could prove it to see whether C could surpass $71.This is an important change moment.FDX confirm the stimulus and that means the increase of interest rates will be follow.
"Citigroup is another zombie company. The best thing they could do is rename the company and hope people forget. Citigroup was at the center of the financial crisis and was never held to account at the company level. Only shareholders have paid the price. Retirement holdings destroyed by a company that was supposed to be conservative in its use of depositor money. The employees have all been bonused out and rewarded for screwing the country and our government is so pathetic they will not hold anyone accountable. The stock price will never rise above tangible book value because the company proved it had no values towards it's shareholders. AND THE MARKET KNOWS THIS They should rename the company crypto -ripoff - associates backed by the full faith, not assets, of Ben and Jerry's Ice cream. The robin hood crowd will flock to them and long term shareholders may have a chance to get a little of their money back.They should have broken them up, that would have been best for shareholders, but they have a strong lobby in washington and we all know policy goes to the highest bidder in our government"

"Fed's decision to lift restrictions on Banks today will elevate the share prices for the banks such as Citibank, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase."
If the Q does disappoint then it'll tank 20%. If it beats then it'll pop 5% anf move towards 20% if guidance is extraordinary!!
"Was there a rule allowing buyback of common stock from the Sept/Dec stress result? Was always confused by this.So, 2.027bn shares outstanding. So the float dropped by 2%. Positive.SO does that mean there's only capacity to repurchase another 40m? (Assumes ~5bn left in the kitty from the 2017 stock repurchase agreement?)When you look at the breakdown of revs vs geography...shows declines. IS this 'quarter Q2 'related?Let's see how the CC goesTBV rising makes me laugh....Only major bank to consistently trade under it. Just moving the yard stick further away.Unless they announce a new stock repurchase authorization, not going to get closer or exceed TBV, unless the business environment changes."
"On July 14, the managers confirmed that, if possible, they will make a repurchase at a share price below the tangible book value.At the end of June, this figure is $ 77.67."
"When you look at today's chart, Jane and Mason need to review their comments and ask themselves how they conducted that CC for it to tank the way it does at 10.25am.Not even a slow drop.....If you plan on kitchen sinking the results....for god sake, do it in the ER press release."
"Wow did not expect this, what's causing the the run up?I sold a bunch of covered calls for $75 expires next Friday, hope the shares don't get called away."
How can Snap be worth all most as much as Citi...investing based on financial information does not work on this market...

"Zack analysts now say Citi's book value has jumped from $77/share to $90.86/share. Rami, you could buy Citi now for $71/share, piece meal it out and make yourself a few billion dollars.How can a class company like Citi be so undervalued?"
Whoohoo looks like its recovering nicely. I added an extra 100 shares during the dip. Sitting at 8300 shares now.
Book value is 96.
"On Wednesday, this week, the minutes of the Fed's meeting following the July 27-28 meeting are expected to be published, at which two important issues were discussed: when to start reducing monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, and how quickly to reduce them.Only after solving these two pressing issues will the Fed think about when to start raising the interest rate from the current almost zero level.Strong reports from the labor market have once again strengthened the arguments in favor of the fact that the Fed will announce its intentions to start reducing the asset purchase program either at the next meeting on September 21-22 or in November."
Good buy here. They didn't raise the dividend but higher yield then JPM at this price. Higher then BAC. This heads back to 80 by year end.
"C has an earnings beat last Q, PPS jumps 2.6% and it’s gone in 3 hours. Similar fate suffered by other banks, most notably USB"
$75 closing.. still long BAC and WFC to all time high.
Lots of positives. 40 million shares bought back. Expenses at lower end of expectations. Citi on track to hit EPS of $9 over the next 4 quarters. Will take another 40 million shares bought back in Q3. In 6 months TBV will be over $81.
Citi and JPM are in great shape. in 2009 Citi had to borrow 45 billion due to they had no money but a lot of assets now they have almost 1 trillion in cash and a lot less assets. Now with Dementia Joe and Giggles running the country into the ground they can buy Citi back cheap and buy everyone else's stuff back for pennies on the dollar. During the up coming recession Citi and JPM will do great while the money shift hands. Owning Big Banks will pay off. Owning small banks will be ugly again and most everyone will miss what is taking place.
This is going to 75
"No matter how we slice or dice it the Fed was definitely in opposition or even restricted Citi from higher payout to shareholders and investors. I agree with people that the statement was prepared by Citi legal council. The words like ""at least"", ""resiliency"", and notes on attractiveness of buybacks at below book value are all just gimmick to calm investor anxiety and justified impatience. It seems that they know how investors feel about bank management. Unfortunately, after a few developments on bank mismanagement Citi executives again have shown little willing to communicate clearly and transparently. Good CEOs are not afraid to come out and state negative issues with regulators. Even during recent presentations Jane and Mike were very attentively skipping questions about CCAR and capital plans turning into general comments and optimistic investment stories rather than take risky and straightforward lines from analysts and participants. My disappointment with new CEO has moved up slightly."
Why do you think banks are down while a lot of other sectors are up today?Just wondering...
Yes we have inflation and will rise but we believe will tapper of by December.....It is possible to rise into 2022 but we think it will stabilize.
the only positive is they end above 68
Mason gave negative remarks weeks ago so they could buy back shares lower. Now they crushed estimates. Smart.
"China and Hon Kong stock rout is not a welcome sign for a bank like Citi. Given the strategic push into Asian wealth management and exit from consumer businesses near term risk is not supportive for potential valuations of businesses on sale. It is likely that the timing of strategic refresh for Citi could face some adjustments and even delays given uncertain prospects and duration of China regulatory domestic overhaul. I agree with some people that China is experimenting with technology industry to bring it down to more beneficial levels for real economy. Unlike US where tech industry enjoys moderate to low regulatory regime, high pricing power and monopolistic behavior in multiple areas , China seems unlikely to tolerate technology industry ""hijack"" of other economic and social developments. There is no doubt that it could slow technological progress but it is also true that it could better align tech trends with the needs of real economy and social goals."
"Attract no fly, .59%."
Citi hit $80 in May. Next stop is $40.
What a joke!Not even even a 10% divi increase.Can expect a down day!
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."

"Apparently a lot of people hedged with financials fearing the fed would have to move sooner. I think many feared worse from the fed and now are going back into growth/risk on mode. The irony is that inflation and higher rates are still there and the fed actually did not downplay that risk in their statement. At a forward PE of 8, a 3% dividend and with buyback restrictions about to be lifted- this is a screaming buy. The market increases volatility that has been created here is only going to help the trading business of the likes of Citigroup. In 1 month the headlines will be different for the banks and Citi will be well into its recovery back towards $80. Patience."
"The value of management been C 14% below TBV , is less than Zero, market think that management Will destroy capital , C has a long path to wall, and show that history Will nevera repeat."
Good volume so far.Reckon C is buying back today?
"Rates up C down, not a good sign"
The issue with C is the lack of vision. They are exiting some of the best growth markets.
"yup.. Buying banks is safest play..Moses, 2021"
"Citigroup looks stronger than BAC and JPM, even it is dropping.I think around $28 is the ground and Citigroup has undervalued with no rally for one month.I think the interest rate starting to increased from the autumn in 2021.All the bank sectors will start the rally path to 100% in the end of 2021.This time is buy and hold."
Crazy drop for 10% in a few days.I hope $64 is the ground. The market is angry to give pressure to FED.Add the interest rate immediately.
"Very tempting to buy banks as the whole debate on growth concerns is simply made up to justify technical market reasons. It is particularly attractive given buybacks and dividends announcements. People speculate about inflation a lot not even having sufficient evidence on whether its transitory or sticky. Even Fed is uncertain. Nevertheless, economy has to recover on reopening from Covid. There is no other choice or everything will fall into complete chaos. From the market timing perspective it is still risky as the market is flooded by beta quant kings, ETFs and fund liquidity trading. Nobody knows how and where these market forces will take us. Some softness in economic data is quite natural after strong data readings for months. Economies can not generate strong readings forever and some slowdown should have been expected."
Folks Jane has not said what they are doing yet. Read the statement it has nothing to say about what citi is going to do. It’s telling you the results from the stress test same as JPM.
COSTCO credit cards are issued by City Banks.... Berry powerful...
"I think $64 is the ground. This is prefect to climb 80% to $115, which is the market made target at the end of 2021.May be tomorrow still have a storm. I hope $64 could stand strongly."
"Here is the biggest stock manipulation prime example is (C), after 13years this stock is still trading around the $7.00 mark,I bet that I will get a bunch of thumbs down on the post cause it's real and clowns,bobbleheads and jungle bunnies of wall street real hate to see people posting stuff that's a fact,Booyah."
Warning last week from the company met with an upgrade on full year 2021 earnings estimates? Buy.
Again and again people pay too much attention to the playoff between dividends and buyback. This is simply not the right way to look at the business and it has to be taken in the context of business operational efficiency and operating leverage. Higher dividends is a signal of confidence in stability and less risky cash flow generation. Review Morgan's Gorman comments on doubling dividends. Buybacks are good in case business is improving its operational efficiency even if capitalization is above book value. Unfortunately the street has very little understanding when and how first signs of improvement will reemerge.
Will end the year with TBV of $81. I see 40-45 million shares bought back in Q3.
20% correction is done... time to buy before interest rate rises.
"As you can see with Well Fargo when you treat your investors right they go up and Jane and Mark with Citi Did not and they are going down.Reduce Jain's pay from 18 million to 4 million may wake her up. Its the right thing to do, pay for performance not promises."
Well- it looks like they may be able to buyback more shares at an incredible discount to TBV. This will pay off.
Love Jane Fraser! Keep buying back the stock and sell the underperforming businesses
Rates are just moving in wild daily moves that suggest more technical issues than economic. As usual some market forces drive such volatility in rates and shifts in the curve on rather technical reasons rather than economic. Quite big and fast move upward in rates since July 2020 has led to a point of crowded and concentrated positioning and eventually starts to unwind. It is always like that in different asset classes. The bad thing is other asset classes have to unfairly suffer as such institutional traders and funds have to scale back their exposure.
