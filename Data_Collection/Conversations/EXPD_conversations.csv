"EXPD is getting so fat. It used to be a lean well-oiled machine. The corporate structure is incredibly bloated and increasingly expensive. They have operations running around doing busy work and not growing the business. Being ""green"" on some internal measurement is more important than the bottom line, or top line for that matter. Quickly becoming just another bloated behemoth. I've been a loyal client for more than 20 years and know the history pretty well. I've known a lot of the players, especially in the Midwest. As an investor, they're direction really bothers me. It used to be very few chiefs and a lot of indians. Now it's kind of the opposite."
