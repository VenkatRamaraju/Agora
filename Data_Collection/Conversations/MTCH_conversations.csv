IAC is up 5.58% to 146.50
Micheladas
Time to buy :)
Wondering what the price action would be like leading up to s&p inclusion on September 20..
"Posting again, no other way to meet people. Cocid or no Covid, dating sites only way. These days. Good luck."
"Match is a company with a scamming & unsustainable business model. It is known that 80% of girls want top 20% on all dating apps, those are statistical data published in numerous studies. Just read text reviews of Tinder on Google Play: basically, all are 'this app is useless, it doesn't work for me, my matches are not real...' and all of those reviews are with just 1 or 2 stars. Match Group is even sued by the FTC for scamming practices with bots & fake profiles of girls.Those bottom 80% of guys might spend some time & money for gold subscription, different boosts... and that will be recorded as MTCH revenues, but sooner or later after lack of success they will quit paying anything. Revenues might continue growing only if number of users continue growing: so it is kind of a Ponzi scheme. And girls typically use Tinder only for two things 1. validation, to feel better about themselves (there are actual studies that proves that) 2. to hook up with so called Chads (guys with model level looks).If you are an average-looking guy, this is how Tinder (doesn't) work(s) for you:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZTIbHIsIYwIf you are a female, no matter how ugly or old you are you will have tons of matches with thirsty guys and messages from them:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWzsAcQSv8UHave you seen so called 'chadfishing' experiments with top 1% of guys? It is particularly brutal!! Here is one such experiment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSq54f2JT_U&t=231sTinder & other dating apps represent just a rip-off schema that exploits male thirst and lead to frustration & degeneracy, so MTCH doesn't have long-term future.Don't invest your hard-earned money to companies with unsustainable business model that scam their customers/users."
It will be back to the 155's by mid April
"MTCH, will 10X over next 5 years! Online dating worldwide will 10X!"
"china tinder baby machine ""Momo"" = Hello Group will soon take off! All on board, new asian $MTCH group coming ! STRONG BUY"
"MTCH isn't a fad. Older generations went to the movies, malls, and dances to find love (and flings)..... Millenials and Gen Z'ers use dating apps. Name me another service that is demanded by literally everyone on the planet. It's big business and MTCH dominates the space. Now I just need it to come down a little so I can buy!"
"Solid entry point at $145, just joined the club. Happy to be here :D"
"Leave to Bumble please, so I can buy more of Match Group xx"
I’m gonna buy bumble next week. Anyone else?
"What is the next Match? It is China tinder market leader MOMO Momo Inc ! Top notch tech, extremely undervalued, sell your overvalued stock and ride the china wave, this will 10x tenbagger and much more! STRONG BUY"
Match is up 6.42% to 156.28
Why did this drop today?
"$BMBL growing revenue at 50%...compared to $MTCH at 21%. Match's brands just cannibalize each other, and they bog down their expenses on so many different apps. Bumble, on the other hand, places all of their energy into one, limiting their costs and avoids competing it's brands against one another.$BMBL is the future of dating. Women love it...it's as safe as they can get in a dating app."
This is gonna reach all time highs in the summer. Get in now while it’s still relatively cheap. Great long term play given the landscape of the new dating era.
Angie and Match Group set IAC on fire today with earning reports
Load up easy 20% in next couple weeks
IAC is up 6.84% to 166.63
Match Group Inc. $MTCH Total Debt (mrq) 3.93BMatch Group Inc. $MTCH Book Value Per Share (mrq) -4.50
Should print $170 this Friday then a pullback to $160 the following week.
"Wow great news, Renate nyborg, is such a good fit as tinder CEO. See big changes to come for tinder with this new CEO."
What's guess for Tuesday opening price?
From IAC recent high of $268. (just a month ago.) It is now down about $30 off its high.WTH is going on ?????
"It looks like the earnings report was good news. The only reason I suspect the SP dropped is the simple fact that I bought a call. Had I just watched it and not buy, it would have taken off. Sorry guys."
The Texas law is a great law. Trash this stock
Always down after earnings ... beat or no beat...
why do stocks like these sell for less than the sum of their parts?

$MOMO is very undervalued. Especially compared to $MTCH. This is a clear buy under $30
IAC is down -4.91% to 138.21

"So should we expect the same sudden surge in Bro and Cday, like we just seen in mtch?. Afterall, all three join the index"
Absolutely slaughtered the last week
Is there a reason why match is so down??
Taking some money of the table
"2019 will be FB opening up the wallet and buying MTCH for 25b. a huge win for IAC and fastest, most efficient, way for FB to move into online dating."
Whole market except for the Dow is in a bubble. Vix index turning up but still very very low. Can get better entries on stocks later another day. Was short mtch. Covered. Not sure bubble will pop soon but it’s definitely going to pop.
"Just tried Facebook Dating. Very good. And, totally free + social networking for reference. Afraid, things could become tough for all the dating platforms. It is coming."
$LOV Probably something Match should buy￼
MTCH is dropping to 130 territory tmr.
"""Hinge is quickly becoming an important driver of Match’s intrinsic value. Positioned as an anti-Tinder, relationship app, it’s been consistently gaining share against its closest competitor, Bumble. Hinge has now grown 10 fold since Match’s initial investment in the company in September 2017. Very Bullish."
We’ve seen $155 before. With a strong company like this whats the reason to not see it again. Even if it opens red its just another chance to add nore shares. In the long term theres gains coming if u only recently bought. No need to panic just hold and sit back.
"Bumble and Match should not be a trading stock, junk companies, no one watches the ads on Bumble and Match cancels everyones account and people will not return, fake profiles and spam junk all over the place."
"Glimpse, of the future, Notre Dame's home opener will stream exclusively on Peacock, streaming service! 2 years missed ND championship game could not get it on ABNB host Roku TV. The world is changing at light speed!"
"Selling 25% from here to buy some BMBL, the next MTCH."
"If guidance is cloudy due to variant, watch out below. Holding August 165 calls. Worth the shot. Got them 1/2 off this morning. Like it longer term."
why has it plummetted after market? Any ideas?
"Barry Diller says Trump should resign. Okay that makes sense and so does Chelsea Clinton holding over $6,000,000 of Stock in your company. Where did she get that?! Never had a real job in her life. Russians must have bought it for her."
Down again after hours. So much for a good quarter / year end.Chelsea probably sold all her shares today. The Clinton’s are good about sticking it to you.
Buy MOMO Momo Inc CHINA TINDER MASSIVE UNDERVALUED X10!!!
Looking for a new overreaction play after $FB during the testimony and $MTCH last week. $TSLA if you go low enough tomorrow you may just be what I need
Match reached an all time high at 152.75
demand Clinton he removed from the board
I don't think people realize how good of a long-term investment this market is. Each new generation that comes of age will be more and more comfortable with online dating. It's going to keep growing and I don't think we'll see it plateau until millennials are well into their 70s.
"5 reasons why I won't sell $MOMO at $40... $MOMO analysis for dummies1/ ex cash PE closer to 4 as shareholder equity just under 2 bn USD if memory is correct... (End 2019) 2/ should the growth of Tantan continue at current rate, when will $MOMO be considered as a growth stock again so that the market can't ignore? My guess, is less than 2 years... At that time, people will value it as a growth stock and not as a value stock... Like now Which means PEG ratio > 1.5 ... Which should mean $120 within 2 years? 3/ when management will list Tantan (just an idea) later on in China... I guess price will do ×10 if you check $MTCH and what happened to kuaishou (1024.hk) earlier this year. So $170 target here, overnight... 4/ I couldn't find any other growth stock, priced lower than this value value stock, with so much cash on hands, and printing as much cash yearly... 5/ So, you will understand why my worst case scenario is a bid at $30 tomorrowDon't forget to do your own due diligence as we are all wrong ... even more those days :-)Don't hesitate to correct me, should I be wrong"
Match reached an all time high at 124.26
"Cheers, we will start our climb soon. Great report."
"Yesterday after the close IAC announced that they have pulled their previous guidance, and will not give guidance going forward. Yet the stock is up 4% today. The entire market is a huge bubble right now."
"Great buy! If the central tendency moves back to the moving average we should see shares at 41+. No reason for the drop. The fact this company now owns every major dating platform is going to make it a monster. Just like a portfolio many people diversify between free dating apps. If $FB is free, odds are if they're using a paid service it'll be a premium $MTCH company."
I will add more at $138
200 to close the day?
Tinder is way better than Bumble.
Addition to S&P??.
Are we at the conclusion of the winter of discontent and ready to spring forth into the summer of love? Match feels like the perfect reopen play; time will tell…
I own match but bought tons of shares today in bumble. Earnings on the 10th. They will double value.
why surge today?
"Crazy, Dow is down over 400 pts yet my portfolio is flying high today. Never saw this coming. Thanks $OKTA, $MTCH, $SFIX"
Everybody was saying when BMBL IPO'd to buy that instead of MTCH because of the superior growth rate. That was all fine and dandy until early February when BMBL along with the other high flying profit less names got taken to the slaughter house. I bought both BMBL and MTCH as reopening plays but have lost practically nothing in MTCH while I have had to eat a major loss in BMBL. I now wished I would've dumped BMBL and bought more MTCH. MTCH's earnings growth rate indicates it to be a slow grower but that has not how the stock has behaved at all lately. Fully confident that reopening will revitalize dating services and that MTCH will skyrocket. Not so sure about BMBL...if my losses in it continue to increase I am going to have to lick my wounds and exit.
Why does it show revenue has dropped a lot in 2020 on chart on yahoo finance but they actually increased revenue by 17%?
This stock acts very shady lately ( IAC $152.55) Something is not right

"How to return value to shareholders... The next steps available for MOMO management:1/ Complete current $300m share buyback announced in September 20202/ Announce the next share buyback $1bn?(2.1 bn shareholder equity / As of September 30, 2020, Momo's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and long-term deposits totaled RMB15,764.1 million (US$2,321.8 million))3/ IPO of Tantan in Hong Kong in 2022, sell 5% of shares? whenever ready (I would suggest when 1bn yearly revenue reached, so should be no later than 2022 if current growth stays there) => check IPO of Kuaishou 1024.hk : ""Kuaishou’s shares opened in Hong Kong on Friday at HK$338 ($43.6) apiece, a 194% jump from its IPO price of HK$115 ($14.8). That catapults its market cap to nearly HK$1.4 trillion ($180 billion). "" (under $4 bn revenue in 2020)=> $BMBL market cap of $7bn (revenue very close to Tantan, 165m in Q4 )=> $MTCH market cap of $41 bn ($2.4 bn revenue expected for2021)=> so, all those are trading at ratios of 10 to 40 times the revenues...=>I let you imagine what valorisation Tantan IPO would get... it looks like at least $10bn if you do the mathAs many know, Tantan business is not dependent of Chinese politics... on the contrary, it looks like China needs more babies..."
$160+ today/tomorrow!
"This stock has done well. However, I'm not so confident about the long-term prospects. Reason being is that, just like most other things in society, the 80/20 rule may apply to dating apps. In other words, 80% of the women are likely going after the top 20% of men, which may make things difficult for the other 80% of men on these apps. Those 80% of men may still have hope and are willing to spend on paid/premium services to increase their chances, but the big question is will there come a point when the 80% of men (who I suspect are the primary revenue stream) become frustrated and essentially throw in the towel? That's my primary concern with this stock. Also, male/female relations have seemingly deteriorated greatly over the last 2 decades and I see no evidence of that reversing any time soon."
Tired of listening these spinoffs. Stock holders have no control?
"why don't u take a look at MOMO, largest dating app in Asia, same TTM revenue while only 5% of valuation of Match."
"Needs to break 156 to bounce to 168 (can happen within a week), if rejected it will pull back to 145.. here’s a nice little hedge you can play for ~5.00 total:6/25 157.50c7/2 160c6/25 149p"
This thing is moving around this afternoon
What happened to IAC since the earnings announcement a couple of weeks ago ????? It has been in reverse falling from about $268 to its current price of $235.What is wrong ???
"Alert! Watched the Chicago Cubs play last night, there were no families or kids at Wrigley! Just 45 thousand singles, drinking like it was 1999, trying to hook up!!!! This is the Tinder summer!"
"No retail investor can cause the price to drop this much, it was most likely done by institutions. Seeing that MTCH is 97% owned by institution, one can only hope that they stop selling."
"Net earnings were $323.4 million, or 189.5% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Lol that’s funny accounting making you think the earning report was good. Adjusted EBITDA was $46.1 million, or 27.0% of revenue. Stock is still way overvalued. $MTCH is biggest competitor had and adjusted EBITDA of $230 million or 34%. With a lower P/E ratio and more apps across different age groups $MTCH is the better investment. IMO"
"Perfect call to buy yesterday, now let's take off "
This firm has come back very fast. Let’s hope the momentum continues!
Easy 7% gain at current levels after tonight’s earnings. buy and hold LT
Invested in both BMBL and MTCH today. MTCH is both a COVID play and a reopening play. Economic reopening will bring back a ton of business for them as more people will be meeting up to date due to the vaccines. Wishing I'd bought in March but I'm firmly convinced the party is far from over.
"Hi All, wrote an article comparing Bumble with the market leader Match Group after Bumble's IPO last week. Still think Match Group has the edge... $BMBL $MTCHhttps://www.thetwentiestrader.com/post/should-you-take-a-swipe-at-bumble"
"Sell your overvalued stock and come to china match MOMO Momo inc, waaay better growth and numbers, just look at the balance sheet! RMB rising, biggest markets, Buyback + DIVIDEND, profitable for a long time!!Asia giant Momo will beat Match HARD!!!"
I met the love of my life on ok cupid. Thank you MTCH - it simply works. Cheers to a summer of creating fun connections and many to last a lifetime.
"in case you didn't know, IAC is presenting at suntrust robinson humphrey technology internet and services conference. guess what they have to say??"
Seems like tinder isn’t as hot in the US anymore. And wonder who’s actually paying for tinder gold
Is this direct offering good or bad for the short term?
This is a pyramid scheme stock look at debt they sell nothing but air :)))
Down again this morning. It is currently about 40 points lower than its recent high of about 278 just 2 1/2 to 3 weeks ago. This is a very unstable stock.I own it but I’m not happy.
"Congrats boys, we are back to where we started this morning. So much for the pointless earnings play."
"IAC owns Vimeo, the livestreaming video company for business. Wonder if that supports near term."
Facebook Dating may have an impact on Match Group. Your thoughts?
ATH!
Cramer had some good things to say. Claimed that IAC's partial ownership of ANGI and Match alone should give it a market value of $18B instead of the $15.4B it currently sits at.
I’ve been following this company for the past month and it’s been steadily moving higher. Volume isn’t very high but it acts like a “keeper “.
"$40B marketcap, 66 fwd P/E? This stock has a lot of good news priced into it, I like the brands, but lots of potential downside imo. If you’re looking for value with more upside, check out $MOMO"
"Lmao holy, didn’t know this was this low. Loaded up instantaneously, no hesitation. What a sale"
What is wrong with MTCH?
IAC/InterActiveCorp reached an all time high at 303.69
"$MOMO $HUYA $DOYU $BABA WILL OVERTAKE THEIR US RIVALS!!

Somebody wanted out. Thanks for the shared under $138.
"bought more today, unbelievable that the company is still so cheap compared to its balance sheets/growth prospects, dividend etc - look at $MTCH Match Group valuation for a reference, should be in the 50s now!!"
EPS anywhere? Rev looks good
What u guys think of Bumble stock ?BMBL - Ur opinions would be appreciated. What u guys think it will be in coming future ? What u expect in terms of share price?
Match reached an all time high at 165.97
Saw my future wife at the cleaners. Then she found me on Match.com Married in 2009. Bought the stock. Am happy with the stock. Even happier when I see it up 8% today. What is causing the stock to jump today? I see no news.
"I’d like to get in, just not here. 165 would be more compelling."
The last week has been terrible forIAC. The year end/ quarterly numbers are leaking out again. The Feds should take notice.
"Thinking, Hyperconnect has the potential to make MTCH a trillion dollar company! MTCH is about to become a Frictionless, AI, AR, Communication platform for the WORLD! It is fresh, fun, and could become the social network that knocks off FB. Brilliant Acquisition!"
Added more today
"I bought back at 30$! This is one of my best preforming stocks. So I heard that there is some litigation being levied against this company. Who knows about that. I bet it was some negative ninny trying to get me to sell. I see this being over 200 by Q2. Online dating and connecting has been all there has been for many people during the pandemic, but it is also a refuge from places like facebook, where to connect you have to show all of who you are and your history. With dating apps you can connect and flirt and talk but not have to completely engage until the time is right. I don't know, just some thoughts. I see this expanding bigger!"
"There's not but bots on Tinder, I guess more people is buying the stock than the app."
Revenue Growth is accelerating!!
Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge maintains Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) with a Outperform and raises the price target from $145 to $175. There is a lot of call options at 165.
"MTCH, going to make it rain Gold, next 12 months as life returns to normal. Match is sitting on top of the most valuable consumer data, Single looking for experiences to impress a potential mate."
"Online dating models essentially target two types of singles- those looking for commitment and those who are not. Typically the free /w ad revenue model, as proposed by $FB, appeals most to those who are not. These individuals looking for a hookup typically use a number of these free dating services simply because they are free and they increase exposure. These people might buy a premium subscription to enhance their experience, but the majority will not, and these subscriptions are cheap. Tinder is by far the market leader in this space simply because it works well without premium and offers a relative level on anonymity. The other client demographic looking for commitment is typically more interested in a premium, service at a premium price, that eliminates those looking for a quick hookup by demanding ""skin in the game"", again Match has done well in this department- and with the free users, will not likely face much overlap with $FB due to the crow free attracts. Not to mention PoF and Ok!Cupid are doing well existing in a space somewhat in between these two models. The argument that a ""free model"" from $FB will wipeout $MTCH is null as Match.com does not target free users, and because Tinder, Pof, and Ok!Cupid offer a free experience. The argument that users will leave is also null because most users of free services spread their time and across platforms. This is a pure PR move, and while an earnings miss could be a bump in the road, this FB news is irrelevant to future value of the enterprise."
BUY MTCH and NEE for future profits.
If it dips today for sure I'm buying. This stock has an amazing outlook for the future.

Look at IAC’s after hours trading last night and this morning pre market trading. Who can say that the quarterly numbers don’t leak ???This should be reported to the SEC. A disgrace for sure.
Bumble’s arrival on stock market is going to damage Match stock alot. Many investors will shift to BMBL for growth reasons
TO THE MOOOOON
The bump is from the AAPL ruling. MTCH benefits from lower appstore fees.
"Google published several changes to its Google Play Store policy on Wednesday, including banning ""sugar dating"" apps. The policy change in question reads, ""We're updating the inappropriate content policy to institute new restrictions on sexual content, specifically prohibiting compensated sexual relationships (i.e. sugar dating).""https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569?hl=en-GB"

Match acquisition of Hyper Connect out of Korea is well done! Opens up huge market and very strong format of one on one connections. Nice Work.
$momo makes similar revenue and earnings compared to $Mtch but at less than 1/10 the valuation. This is a no brainer and should be at least a $50 stock (if not much more)
"Nice beat, picked up a few AH -6 should be green tomorrow imho"
IAC has announced a plan to spin off its 84% stake in Match Group. Some time in the second quarter. I wonder if they will do the same with Angi list?

$MTCH stock is doing great. Product diversity and a high demand is key. Leading indicators sensed this turn 2 weeks in advance. https://www.blusignalsystems.com/mtch-stock-rises-leading-indicators-connect-opportunity/
Glad to lock in some gains from the employee stock grant. :)

"The target is $175, not yet finished.But how many people will hold the money on fire till next week?"
"Motley Fool just put MTCH, on 10 best picks for July. Pretty good endorsement. MTCH, sure looks like a Trillion dollar company in 5 - 7 years!"
"Current PE = 4.06 (ex Cash), Thank you @MartinI did some work on that and found out that the number of shares outstanding in Yahoo is well correct (2 shares per ADS).""As of September 30, 2020, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was 415,801,407."" in last Q3 reportMOMO INC SPON ADS EACH REP 2 ORD SHS CL A MOMO INC SPONSORED ADR CLASS A =>208m ADS=> market cap = 208 * 17.14 =3.56bnShareholder equity = 2.1 bn""As of September 30, 2020, Momo's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and long-term deposits totaled RMB15,764.1 million (US$2,321.8 million), compared to RMB15,225.3 million as of December 31, 2019.

"Hey guys (or gals)...looking at Match, but Yahoo is showing sales down a crazy amount in the last 3 quarters....like an eye popping amount (down like 50% year over year in each of the last 3 quarters)...does anyone know if these figures are REAL, and if so, how can sales be down **that much** , and what the possible reasons are if so???Serious replies appreciated! :)"
"Undervalued still. Still time to load up, gonna be a quick turn around"
What a beast today
"Can this be the $MTCH of China? If so, this looks like a great time to get in — considering their solid fundamentals."
"Why did it dip to $135 after market? Snatched up some at that level, nice to see it bounce a bit after too."
MTCH. leader in their indsutry. Stock would be $200 if it wasn't for the growth stock correction we've been having. ER was solid and we should see this thing start heading back up. $200 later in 2021 is my expectation. Ignore the douches that keep calling it a bubble. When everyone is scared is when you jump in and people are scared right now.
Down 12% because of Match.com? Crazy
"wow still ultra cheap! Look @ $MTCH Match Group Market Cap ,revenue and Profit is Not far Off, Hello Group IS extremely undervalued!!"
"If I was $MTCH or $BMBL management, I would buy 20% of $MOMO company ($600m now) ... as a hedge in case they miss the biggest world market... and... as long term cash management... with the 4% dividend... and all the upside if growth is back as suspected... this is a no brainer... While Momo has nearly has much cash on its account as its own market cap...Daimler had 10% of $TSLA not so long ago... was a clever move to keep it... but nice to take it in the past... it is just a hedge..."
Financials released after close showed double digit gains despite a COVID year. A dip today is surprising and a good opportunity to pick up.
"Down 8% today..,so picked some up...thank you very much :)"
"About to reach new highs on earnings report, this company cannot fail with more lockdowns coming, this should be $150+ by tomorrow morning."
