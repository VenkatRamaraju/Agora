We’ve seen $155 before. With a strong company like this whats the reason to not see it again. Even if it opens red its just another chance to add nore shares. In the long term theres gains coming if u only recently bought. No need to panic just hold and sit back.
What a beast today
"MTCH isn't a fad. Older generations went to the movies, malls, and dances to find love (and flings)..... Millenials and Gen Z'ers use dating apps. Name me another service that is demanded by literally everyone on the planet. It's big business and MTCH dominates the space. Now I just need it to come down a little so I can buy!"
"5 reasons why I won't sell $MOMO at $40... $MOMO analysis for dummies1/ ex cash PE closer to 4 as shareholder equity just under 2 bn USD if memory is correct... (End 2019) 2/ should the growth of Tantan continue at current rate, when will $MOMO be considered as a growth stock again so that the market can't ignore? My guess, is less than 2 years... At that time, people will value it as a growth stock and not as a value stock... Like now Which means PEG ratio > 1.5 ... Which should mean $120 within 2 years? 3/ when management will list Tantan (just an idea) later on in China... I guess price will do ×10 if you check $MTCH and what happened to kuaishou (1024.hk) earlier this year. So $170 target here, overnight... 4/ I couldn't find any other growth stock, priced lower than this value value stock, with so much cash on hands, and printing as much cash yearly... 5/ So, you will understand why my worst case scenario is a bid at $30 tomorrowDon't forget to do your own due diligence as we are all wrong ... even more those days :-)Don't hesitate to correct me, should I be wrong"
What's happening?
Short Squeeze possible?
"Undervalued still. Still time to load up, gonna be a quick turn around"
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"

"Current PE = 4.06 (ex Cash), Thank you @MartinI did some work on that and found out that the number of shares outstanding in Yahoo is well correct (2 shares per ADS).""As of September 30, 2020, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was 415,801,407."" in last Q3 reportMOMO INC SPON ADS EACH REP 2 ORD SHS CL A MOMO INC SPONSORED ADR CLASS A =>208m ADS=> market cap = 208 * 17.14 =3.56bnShareholder equity = 2.1 bn""As of September 30, 2020, Momo's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and long-term deposits totaled RMB15,764.1 million (US$2,321.8 million), compared to RMB15,225.3 million as of December 31, 2019.

"So should we expect the same sudden surge in Bro and Cday, like we just seen in mtch?. Afterall, all three join the index"
"I bought back at 30$! This is one of my best preforming stocks. So I heard that there is some litigation being levied against this company. Who knows about that. I bet it was some negative ninny trying to get me to sell. I see this being over 200 by Q2. Online dating and connecting has been all there has been for many people during the pandemic, but it is also a refuge from places like facebook, where to connect you have to show all of who you are and your history. With dating apps you can connect and flirt and talk but not have to completely engage until the time is right. I don't know, just some thoughts. I see this expanding bigger!"
"How to return value to shareholders... The next steps available for MOMO management:1/ Complete current $300m share buyback announced in September 20202/ Announce the next share buyback $1bn?(2.1 bn shareholder equity / As of September 30, 2020, Momo's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and long-term deposits totaled RMB15,764.1 million (US$2,321.8 million))3/ IPO of Tantan in Hong Kong in 2022, sell 5% of shares? whenever ready (I would suggest when 1bn yearly revenue reached, so should be no later than 2022 if current growth stays there) => check IPO of Kuaishou 1024.hk : ""Kuaishou’s shares opened in Hong Kong on Friday at HK$338 ($43.6) apiece, a 194% jump from its IPO price of HK$115 ($14.8). That catapults its market cap to nearly HK$1.4 trillion ($180 billion). "" (under $4 bn revenue in 2020)=> $BMBL market cap of $7bn (revenue very close to Tantan, 165m in Q4 )=> $MTCH market cap of $41 bn ($2.4 bn revenue expected for2021)=> so, all those are trading at ratios of 10 to 40 times the revenues...=>I let you imagine what valorisation Tantan IPO would get... it looks like at least $10bn if you do the mathAs many know, Tantan business is not dependent of Chinese politics... on the contrary, it looks like China needs more babies..."
"Online dating models essentially target two types of singles- those looking for commitment and those who are not. Typically the free /w ad revenue model, as proposed by $FB, appeals most to those who are not. These individuals looking for a hookup typically use a number of these free dating services simply because they are free and they increase exposure. These people might buy a premium subscription to enhance their experience, but the majority will not, and these subscriptions are cheap. Tinder is by far the market leader in this space simply because it works well without premium and offers a relative level on anonymity. The other client demographic looking for commitment is typically more interested in a premium, service at a premium price, that eliminates those looking for a quick hookup by demanding ""skin in the game"", again Match has done well in this department- and with the free users, will not likely face much overlap with $FB due to the crow free attracts. Not to mention PoF and Ok!Cupid are doing well existing in a space somewhat in between these two models. The argument that a ""free model"" from $FB will wipeout $MTCH is null as Match.com does not target free users, and because Tinder, Pof, and Ok!Cupid offer a free experience. The argument that users will leave is also null because most users of free services spread their time and across platforms. This is a pure PR move, and while an earnings miss could be a bump in the road, this FB news is irrelevant to future value of the enterprise."
What's guess for Tuesday opening price?

"Bumble and Match should not be a trading stock, junk companies, no one watches the ads on Bumble and Match cancels everyones account and people will not return, fake profiles and spam junk all over the place."
"The target is $175, not yet finished.But how many people will hold the money on fire till next week?"
$170 is possible for tomorrow?
Should print $170 this Friday then a pullback to $160 the following week.
why surge today?
"Wow great news, Renate nyborg, is such a good fit as tinder CEO. See big changes to come for tinder with this new CEO."
"MTCH, going to make it rain Gold, next 12 months as life returns to normal. Match is sitting on top of the most valuable consumer data, Single looking for experiences to impress a potential mate."

"This stock has done well. However, I'm not so confident about the long-term prospects. Reason being is that, just like most other things in society, the 80/20 rule may apply to dating apps. In other words, 80% of the women are likely going after the top 20% of men, which may make things difficult for the other 80% of men on these apps. Those 80% of men may still have hope and are willing to spend on paid/premium services to increase their chances, but the big question is will there come a point when the 80% of men (who I suspect are the primary revenue stream) become frustrated and essentially throw in the towel? That's my primary concern with this stock. Also, male/female relations have seemingly deteriorated greatly over the last 2 decades and I see no evidence of that reversing any time soon."
Everybody was saying when BMBL IPO'd to buy that instead of MTCH because of the superior growth rate. That was all fine and dandy until early February when BMBL along with the other high flying profit less names got taken to the slaughter house. I bought both BMBL and MTCH as reopening plays but have lost practically nothing in MTCH while I have had to eat a major loss in BMBL. I now wished I would've dumped BMBL and bought more MTCH. MTCH's earnings growth rate indicates it to be a slow grower but that has not how the stock has behaved at all lately. Fully confident that reopening will revitalize dating services and that MTCH will skyrocket. Not so sure about BMBL...if my losses in it continue to increase I am going to have to lick my wounds and exit.
Has something to do with apple and App Store ruling I bet
Wondering what the price action would be like leading up to s&p inclusion on September 20..
Micheladas
What happens when Apple caves in........time to start loading some calls
Is this direct offering good or bad for the short term?
There is not much to celebrate here and I assume most of the earning coming from Apple platform.
Addition to S&P??.
"bought more today, unbelievable that the company is still so cheap compared to its balance sheets/growth prospects, dividend etc - look at $MTCH Match Group valuation for a reference, should be in the 50s now!!"
The bump is from the AAPL ruling. MTCH benefits from lower appstore fees.
