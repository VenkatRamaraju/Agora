Your patience is appreciated while the Nasdaq $NDAQ market site gets fixed to allow more DWAC stock trading...
So why is his stock underperforming the Nasdaq index since December 1 by 20% ? Something to do with banning companies that are not poliically correct ?
$NDAQ Target Raised by Rosenblatt Securities NeutralUSD 210 » USD 220Maintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 252 » USD 250Target Lowered by Deutsche Bank Buy USD 230 » USD 225
Everyone is racing to sell their shares first before they lose the money and become bagholders
"Paul, once FDA approval we should see an increase in the share price. My guess would be +20 %. This would be because of some of the shorts covering. My opinion would be once the market see that AXSM commercial launch is successful then we could see triple digits. Once earnings show profitability AXSM would be off to the races. JMHO"
200 right around the corner!
We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money. Check for yourself: $NDAQ at all time highs today whereas $IXIC slumps. IF this game ain't rigged to the core I don't know anymore. ALGOS + NDAQ Exchange collusion? You bet... $baba $tsla $aapl $momo $msft $dji $pltr $fb $goog $jd $nflxSEC please step it and go after the algo traders and exchanges. The fish always starts smelling bad at the head.
Anybody knows what's going on today. Their 3QT report is excellent.
Nasdaq reached an all time high at 206.57
So much DWAC shares traded pre-market that Nasdaq $NDAQ site is broken down...
"NDAQ, SPGI, MSCI are part of my long position and I'm very bullish on them. Long term hold for my retirement. The 3 of them are performing better than their individual indices."
"I'm a buyer of this stock, I increase my position every week as much as I can in order for ndaq to take 10% of my portfolio. NDAQ is performing better than Nasdaq index."
Gradually heading towards $180
This is a great stock to go long on
NDAQ reached a new All Time High at 85.88
Great relative strength in NDAQ right now compared to other exchange trading names..Every dip in this name is getting bought and valuation is still reasonable here IMO
