At 120 Ndaq is below p/s 4 ( below p/s 5 including debt ) for 2020 and is the cheapest major exchange. Revenue is solid and up despite the shutdowns and the payout ratio is healthy i.e. leaves room to invest or pay off debt which is i.m.o. a prerequisite to being called a div stock. Companies that borrow to pay div or buy back shares are garbage

"Paul, once FDA approval we should see an increase in the share price. My guess would be +20 %. This would be because of some of the shorts covering. My opinion would be once the market see that AXSM commercial launch is successful then we could see triple digits. Once earnings show profitability AXSM would be off to the races. JMHO"

"Futures bounced off resistance and rallying back hard. Shorts are gonna fry tomorrow. Instead of this being $900 tomorrow like it would have with normal buying and short covering today it’s going to be $1000 tomorrow because all the dumb shorts (just look at this forum) who bet against it. It’s going to be crazy, even I can admit, but if this futures rally continues we will see TSLA at $1,000 tomorrow. $SPY $^DJI $NDAQ"

We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money. Check for yourself: $NDAQ at all time highs today whereas $IXIC slumps. IF this game ain't rigged to the core I don't know anymore. ALGOS + NDAQ Exchange collusion? You bet... $baba $tsla $aapl $momo $msft $dji $pltr $fb $goog $jd $nflxSEC please step it and go after the algo traders and exchanges. The fish always starts smelling bad at the head.
