"How many times has this turd reverse split, sold a billion shares, than rinse and repeat in the last 10 years?? Lost count. Only time it goes up!"

"I think that the .18 offering price is acting as a floor right now because if it falls below that, what would prevent the buyers of this offering from buying at a lower price on the open market? The offering is expected to close Friday so what do you think will happen then when the floor is removed?"
TOP Ships Announces Change in Its Capital Raising Corporate Strategy and Other Corporate DevelopmentsIn march say never offer new equity so iti is not true?
"I just read the recent SEC filing and on March 27 they completed an offering of 52,692,690 shares. I can’t determine what this was if it was to cover debt with an investor. The quantity of common shares available after the latest 40 million offering is 117,705,155￼￼"
One year chart looks good! Higher lows
"Just remember, the stock market is going to be closed tomorrow for Good Friday, so there could be a lot of selling today, so don't be surprised if TOPS heads down towards .20. Hope everyone has a wonderful day, stay safe & stay healthy.."
dont buy tops never ever
After the latest ATM O/S will be 127 million shares.Expect R/S of 1 for 50.
Tanker rates surprisingly resilient. One reason: negative vessel supply effect of drawdown of intentional floating storage is (so far) largely being offset by new unintentional floating storage due to escalating China congestion.

"Oh boy , the company keep get new ship , the stock price keep going downThat not natural."
"If there is a harsh winter, product tankers which have not benefited from the near end of Covid stand to gain:""Nothing warms product tanker carriers like a cold winter in the Northern Hemisphere where the majority of the world's population resides.It's always been that way, but October 2021 stands out for multiple reasons. In part, the world has stumbled into an unexpected energy crisis, short on gas and coal, and in part, an upturn in the market fueled by freezing temperatures could kick off the long-awaited business that product tanker carriers have been eagerly awaiting.The carriers as well as crude oil freighters are largely the only two segments in shipping that aren't benefiting from the major progress generated by the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.Hence why executives from a number of dominant shipping companies unanimously projected that it is a matter of time before the upturn extends to their sector, and that a cold winter could accelerate the development.With a shortage of gas in the UK and a shortage of coal in India, the population isthe population is likely to switch to old-fashioned generators to stay warm, which will require refined oil products such as petroleum.""As long as that happens, we have tailwinds""In addition, a number of Western economies are well on their way in terms of vaccines, so much so that travel restrictions are being lifted, which will pave the way for the use of air fuel again. That said, the estimated level of commercial air travel remains 20 percent below 2019 levels, according to the Capital Links conference last week.But as Torm CEO Jacob Meldgaard pointed out, demand for refined oil products has been higher than the supply since June of this year. In August, it was so high that it drained inventories of 3 percent.""As long as that happens, we have tailwinds."""

It increased by 4324963 shares yesterday. Most of these new short positions are losing money as they must have opened at around $1.17. Once the price gets closer to $1.30 (what is very likely today) shorts will panic cover pushing the price even higher. This is the feedback loop the longs need. It will happen like this for a number of days and this is what will take us to $2.25 region where there might be a little of consolidation and after that towards the date of Q2 results we might see the price to go parabolic to $3.40. Q2 results and the guidance the company will be the catalyst for the capitulation of shorts and we may see an epic short squeeze. In many cases shipping companies use those short squeezes to rise more capital and dilute. If you listen carefully the Q1 earnings call the CEO said there will be no dilution until at least Q4. If they dilute before the CEO will be in the violation of the Securities Act and I don’t think he would do it. There are plenty of law firms specializing in securities laws that would immediately jump on the idea of making money on such an easy case. This is a very good time for us fellow shipping magnates. This in no advice. I am just a trader and shared with you my view on SHIP. If you click on my name you will see I am trading SHIP long only since when it was $0.80 last year. I invested in SHIP because I saw they have the business model that benefits a lot from current high shipping rates and they added 45% more vessels since Q1, while at the same time reduced their debt. They must be making a lot of money now and there is a great probability the company will pay dividend out of 2021 profits. This is a true turnaround story. The expenses the company are in line with the industry standards so there is no way the management is circumventing any money (what shorts falsly claim). Actually the expenses in relation to revenue are smaller than $DSX which is at least twice as big as SHIP (in terms of revenue and DWT)One more thing. I came across an information that stock bashers here are paid $7 each time you engage with them. The more you engage with them the more they are motivated to post lies and non sense. Longs should post just facts. Facts are very good."
How many times Company can do a revert reverse split?
"They are back to their old tricks again. Another reverse split is scheduled for this Monday. They have been doing this for over 16 years. Dilute then reverse... over and over again. To put into perspective just how many times they have been doing this reverse split dance.. TOPS would have to climb to 230,000,000 dollars a share for an investor from 2004 just to break even. Yes, you read that correctly.....230m dollars a share. If you don't believe me look at the historical chart and you will see. Caveat Emptor."
"everyone bullish. I know some of you newbies to this stock think that this company is going to turn a new leaf and start rewarding shareholders after years of reversing stock splits and never any profits reported. listen carefully. some of us have thoroughly examined their quarterly and annual statements for years. they funnel profits out into private companies in the form of management fees, labor, evem financing, etc. they have created multiple shell private companies to come up with as many ways to spend their profits and funnel money out. this has been their model for years as well as other Greek shipping companies such as drys. if you plan to buy, do not become a bag holder. I do not recommend keeping this stock for over 24 hours if you are feeling like gambling."

Right now, there are 17k shares showing on the 1.50 bid and 1k showing on the ask. If that bid size starts to fall, you might want to think about taking 1.50 while you still can... Now only 16k on the bid and 1k on the ask... Just trying to help."
the train is slowly moving and about to take off :) the jump into 2+ is coming up lads :)
When will they buy another ship so the stock gets to .50 cents again.where they want it.look at the charts
Company thinking to reverse split again . Company issue more shares to trap to innocent stock holder
Equity agreement with Maxim for up to 14.25 million shares. They said that they were not going to do more VARIABLE PRICE financing for 12 months and they are true to their word. This is for a SET number of shares but dilution just the same.
Time to short more on that massive share offer.
Why the after hours pop?
"So this stock was OVER $750 at one point, now it's less than $1.00? Someone explain how it went from Google price down to change"
"Confirmed, this is a scam. The company just keep diluting the shares with so many offerings and at a discount price￼. As soon as it hits $0.20 again I’m out I hope you guys do the same. We should all have listened to Jim. Thanks Jim for the advice."

"Came across this stock a day ago. Someone care to explain what the helk happened? stock was worth 100k one month 1 dollar the next, and 100k the month after that."
So it seems TOPS has found a loophole in their non-binding agreement with shareholders and are now issuing warrants to purchase shares at .01 per share. It allows TOPS to gain revenue without issuing shares. The holders of the warrants when exercised increased the outstanding shares. (Brilliant)
"PAYtience people. TOPS is one of the largest oil tanker companies in the world and there's ONLY so many of them out there. The CEO doesn't seem extremely trustworthy, but look at what they've been doing compared to the present state of the world. Share offerings like crazy, to raise money for more ships. Oil is in surplus right now and the refineries are barely running, so until the world opens back up, this will remain down. When the OK is given, and it will be before Christmas(too much $$ to be lost by politicians) and the refineries turn back on, these will start to move again. Right now they're just sitting there. However, if you've ever shipped a chemical in your life, they collect what's called Demurrage when they can't off-load that chemical/substance. Oil does the same. I confirmed this with a friend in the industry. The CEO has been building a bigger fleet and wouldn't be doing it, if future business wouldn't be there. So just relax and keep adding shares. This will reverse split after they begin to move and will go back to the glory days. What, are we never gonna use oil again?"
Did anyone else notice that TOPS sold one of their tankers for 6.9 million eight days before reporting earnings if 1.7 million. HummHappy trading
Looking very solid at the moment. The weak hands are being bought out.
"I believe TOPS canNOT make another direct offering this year. https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Co-Di/Direct-Public-Offerings.htmlBelow is part of the article. It is a bit confusing because one type of direct offering can offer up to 5 million dollars in shares but TOPS' offering was 6 million dollars. Another type (SB-1) can raise up to 10 million dollars but the total revenue of the company must not exceed 25 million dollars. TOPS had 66 million dollars in revenue in 2019.One thing is clear in the article: no company can make another offering within a 12-month period of time. Here's part of the article.Companies interested in raising capital through a DPO have several options from which to choose. The most common type of DPO is known as a Small Corporate Offering Registration, or SCOR. The SEC provided this option to small businesses in 1982, through an amendment to federal securities law known as Regulation D, Rule 504. SCOR gives an exemption to private companies that raise no more than $1 million in any 12-month period through the sale of stock. There are no restrictions on the number or types of investors, and the securities can be freely traded. The SCOR process is easy enough for a small business owner to complete with the assistance of a knowledgeable accountant and attorney. It is available in most states.A related type of DPO is outlined in SEC Regulation D, Rule 505. This option enables a small business to sell up to $5 million in stock during a 12-month period to an unlimited number of investors, provided that no more than 35 of them are non-accredited. To be accredited, an investor must have sufficient assets or income to make such an investment. According to the SEC rules, individual investors must have either $1 million in assets (other than their home and car) or $200,000 in net annual personal income, while institutions must hold $5 million in assets. A DPO registered through Regulation D, Rule 506, allows a company to sell unlimited securities to an unlimited number of investors, provided that no more than 35 of them are non-accredited. Under Rule 506, investors must be sophisticated, or able to evaluate the merits and understand the risks of the transaction. In both of these options, the securities cannot be freely traded.Another type of DPO is outlined in SEC Regulation A. This option is frequently referred to as a ""mini public offering,"" because it follows many of the same procedures as an IPO and the securities may be freely traded. However, companies choosing this option may only offer up to $5 million in securities in any 12-month period. Regulation A offerings are allowed to bypass federal SEC registration and instead are filed with the Small Business Office of the SEC.Two further types of DPOs are available to businesses with less than $25 million in annual revenues. A Small Business Type 1 (SB-1) offering enables a company to sell up to $10 million in securities in a 12-month period and has simpler paperwork. A Small Business Type 2 (SB-2) filing enables a company to sell an unlimited amount of securities and has more difficult paperwork.A final type of DPO is available through the SEC's intrastate filing exemption, Rule 147. This option allows companies to raise unlimited funds through the sale of securities as long as the stock is sold only in the primary state in which they do business. Both the company and all the investors must be residents of the same state. This exemption is intended to provide local businesses with a means of raising capital within their locale.Any comments are welcomed. I certainly don't want to be stuck in a direct offering and it looks like if I invest in TOPS or SHIP this year that cannot legally happen."

"Inflation is the friend of global shipping. They all operate on a model of cash flow paying the monthly payment on huge debt. So the leverage is very high. It's almost like buying a nonexpiring call option on inflation. When commodity prices go up, those who need to move them from A to B have more capital to bid up shipping services. Look at BDI lately and you will see what I mean. TOPS has put in a double bottom. Just buy a few thousand shares and hold tight."

"I don't believe they will go bust but I do believe they will need to further dilute shareholders. They will need to keep the stock price above $1 until the end of Fridays trading day in order to meet the nasdaq listing requirements. Thats why they announced the buyback. According to tops latest financial from June 30th they are currently running over a 20 million working capital deficit and they have over 200 million in capital needs over the next 18 months, in order to clear the deficit and new build program. since the filing they have raised 15.9 million in capital in July from one dilution round. What I believe is happening is they will try to keep the stock above $1 for the next few days. After they meet the nasdaq listing requirements, Then they will start to raise capital again through share holder dilution to manage the working capital deficit and capital for new builds."

All of the Series E Preferred Shares are held by Family Trading Inc., a company related to Mr. Evangelos Pistiolis, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director.Purchasers of the common shares we sell, as well as our existing shareholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices significantly below the price at which they invested. In addition, we may issue additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future vessel acquisitions, redemptions of our Series E Preferred Shares, or our equity incentive plan, without shareholder approval, in a number of circumstances. Our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution if we issue shares in the future at prices below the price at which previous shareholders invested.……The Series E Preferred Shares contain anti-dilution provisions that could be triggered by the issuance of common shares in a future offering, depending on their offering price. For instance, the issuance by us of common shares for less than $20.00 per common share, which is the current conversion price of the Series E Preferred Shares, could result in an adjustment downward of the Series E Preferred Shares conversion price and an increase in the number of common shares each Series E Preferred Share is converted into. These adjustments could affect the interests of our common shareholders and the trading price for our common shares. Furthermore the Series E Preferred Shares holders have the option to replace the fixed conversion price with a variable exercise price, namely 80% of the lowest daily VWAP of our common shares over the 20 consecutive trading days expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of an exercise notice (but in no event can this variable conversion price be less than $0.60) and purchase such proportionate number of shares based on the variable conversion price in effect on the date of conversion. If using the variable conversion price of the Series E Preferred Shares, as of November 6, 2019, the Series E Preferred Shares have a conversion price of $2.38 and are converted into 7,444,958 common shares per Series E Preferred Share, as may be further adjusted. Moreover, future issuance of other equity or debt convertible into or issuable or exchangeable for common shares at a price per share less than the then current conversion price of the Series E Preferred Shares would result in similar adjustments."
Was hoping someone could answer this for me. I purchased at 34 cents a share. Right now it is saying that my purchase price has changed to .3944 pps. How can the purchased price per share change from one day to the next?
"Never trust these Greek shipping companies, they simply operate by doing constant dilution and reverse splits. SHIP, TOPS both have the same model. Maybe ok to get a nickel profit but holding it for long is a recipe for disaster."
Just waiting for the calls for the stock to go under a dollar as they have every time the stock goes down.
I hope that everyone has a wonderful three day weekend. Stay safe & Stay healthy.....

I heard about TOPS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I bought at 3.. HELP
Its almost about time for an issuance of new stoack and a reverse split. Only .28 cents more to go and then it happens. I cant beleive this stock is still above $1.00. I have no idea why this fraud has not been delisted!
"Now a reverse split.so they can make more on their short.the cycle continues.in 2004 it was 146,000,000,000. Hard to belevie"
"I am beginning to think the bullish people that still post on this message board, just learned what bullish meant."
Looks like consolidation before another move up. At least it looks like it.
"Far more to get out of $CTRM trading at $0,64 $Tops at 2 dollar currently down in the aftermrkt. Ctrm had a 248.65% increase the past 30 days and $Tops had 65,29% before this gamestop mania ctrm stock was all ready growing fast and expected to hit at least 5 by the end of the year ( so a good investment overall) i know cause i got 30 000 shares at $0,20 Castor maritime bought 2 new vessels this month and the are getting ready to purchase a new one. The last time $TOPS announced the purchasing of a new vessel was February 2020! The constant dilution of the company shares and selling of there vessels this past year clearly shows that the company is in distress and is trying to survive. Beter come over here to $CTRM a company with good fundamentals and thank me later "
"Look at the long term chart from 2004.146,000,000,000. to today's price.hard to believe.open up an offshore account short your stock in another name.hmmm"
The market makers remarked the stock price before the market opened knowing it was going to be a blood bath.
great company. this thing should go to 9 in no time...
