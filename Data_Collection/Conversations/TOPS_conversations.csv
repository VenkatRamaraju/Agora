"New trader here- what are the chances of this stock being delisted within the next 90 days? I saw that they received a NASDAQ notice on March 12, 2019? Any thoughts?"
BACK TO .08 & THEN COMES PISTIOLIS' NEXT REVERSE STOCK SPLIT...SHORT ALL YOU CAN
Time to short more on that massive share offer.
"PAY ATTENTIONTop Ships is a stock comprising the value of the ships owned by one of the Pistiolis companies. It is NOT a shipping company.The Central Group is a collection of companies allied to handle the various pieces of the puzzle.https://centralgroupinc.com/companyIn order for the value of TOPS stock to skyrocket, the value of the tanker assets would have to go up dramatically. How can small tankers become more valuable over time?No way. Learn more about the stock."
"Caution everyone: Drys run out the cash....and it could dramtically drop to $2.00 ps in coming day.It is really predict how much cash left for Greece stock.Even Drys has been filed with SEC with when ER the number drop faster than expected.Caution Greece stock: Drys, Tops, Dcix, Glbs.Just like HMNY...low with cash and on they way filing Bankruptcy.Good luck..To me...I won't load anything for shipping stock."
After the latest ATM O/S will be 127 million shares.Expect R/S of 1 for 50.

It increased by 4324963 shares yesterday. Most of these new short positions are losing money as they must have opened at around $1.17. Once the price gets closer to $1.30 (what is very likely today) shorts will panic cover pushing the price even higher. This is the feedback loop the longs need. It will happen like this for a number of days and this is what will take us to $2.25 region where there might be a little of consolidation and after that towards the date of Q2 results we might see the price to go parabolic to $3.40. Q2 results and the guidance the company will be the catalyst for the capitulation of shorts and we may see an epic short squeeze. In many cases shipping companies use those short squeezes to rise more capital and dilute. If you listen carefully the Q1 earnings call the CEO said there will be no dilution until at least Q4. If they dilute before the CEO will be in the violation of the Securities Act and I don’t think he would do it. There are plenty of law firms specializing in securities laws that would immediately jump on the idea of making money on such an easy case. This is a very good time for us fellow shipping magnates. This in no advice. I am just a trader and shared with you my view on SHIP. If you click on my name you will see I am trading SHIP long only since when it was $0.80 last year. I invested in SHIP because I saw they have the business model that benefits a lot from current high shipping rates and they added 45% more vessels since Q1, while at the same time reduced their debt. They must be making a lot of money now and there is a great probability the company will pay dividend out of 2021 profits. This is a true turnaround story. The expenses the company are in line with the industry standards so there is no way the management is circumventing any money (what shorts falsly claim). Actually the expenses in relation to revenue are smaller than $DSX which is at least twice as big as SHIP (in terms of revenue and DWT)One more thing. I came across an information that stock bashers here are paid $7 each time you engage with them. The more you engage with them the more they are motivated to post lies and non sense. Longs should post just facts. Facts are very good."

The last time $TOPS announced the purchasing of a new vessel was February 2020!

"Oh boy , the company keep get new ship , the stock price keep going downThat not natural."
Why the after hours pop?
"If you guys go to the NASDAQ website, you can look up documents published by TOPS. On November 8th, 2017 they published a form 424B5. In that form they disclosed the date of April 9th, 2018 to be compliant with NASDAQ’s $1 per share minimum. That $1 minimum has to be met for 10 days straight in order to stay listed on the NASDAQ. Having that said if the stock doesn’t go up like everyone is hoping, expect TOPS to do a reverse split on Mar 26th, 2018 (+/- 14 days). If the stock is still around this price, then a 1 for 30 reverse split is highly likely. I’m no expert on the stock market but this is my interpretation of official documents I’ve read. I hope this helps and I definitely hope for the best case scenario. Thanks for reading."
"PISTOLI family will always control TOPS voting power, from:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1296484/000091957419006740/d8398648_424b-5.htmWe issued 704,692 common shares and 3,343,775 common shares as of the date of this prospectus supplement during 2018 and 2019, respectively, through various transactions. Shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of our offerings.We have already sold large quantities of our common shares pursuant to previous public and private offerings of our equity and equity-linked securities. We currently have an effective registration statement on Form F-3 (333-215577) for which this prospectus supplement forms a part, for the sale of up $200,000,000, of which approximately $100.8 million has been sold. We also have 17,719 Series E Preferred Shares outstanding, which are convertible into approximately 7,444,958 common shares as of the date of this prospectus. All of the Series E Preferred Shares are held by Family Trading Inc., a company related to Mr. Evangelos Pistiolis, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director.Purchasers of the common shares we sell, as well as our existing shareholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices significantly below the price at which they invested. In addition, we may issue additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future vessel acquisitions, redemptions of our Series E Preferred Shares, or our equity incentive plan, without shareholder approval, in a number of circumstances. Our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution if we issue shares in the future at prices below the price at which previous shareholders invested.……The Series E Preferred Shares contain anti-dilution provisions that could be triggered by the issuance of common shares in a future offering, depending on their offering price. For instance, the issuance by us of common shares for less than $20.00 per common share, which is the current conversion price of the Series E Preferred Shares, could result in an adjustment downward of the Series E Preferred Shares conversion price and an increase in the number of common shares each Series E Preferred Share is converted into. These adjustments could affect the interests of our common shareholders and the trading price for our common shares. Furthermore the Series E Preferred Shares holders have the option to replace the fixed conversion price with a variable exercise price, namely 80% of the lowest daily VWAP of our common shares over the 20 consecutive trading days expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of an exercise notice (but in no event can this variable conversion price be less than $0.60) and purchase such proportionate number of shares based on the variable conversion price in effect on the date of conversion. If using the variable conversion price of the Series E Preferred Shares, as of November 6, 2019, the Series E Preferred Shares have a conversion price of $2.38 and are converted into 7,444,958 common shares per Series E Preferred Share, as may be further adjusted. Moreover, future issuance of other equity or debt convertible into or issuable or exchangeable for common shares at a price per share less than the then current conversion price of the Series E Preferred Shares would result in similar adjustments."
"Rally in the making, give it 1 month, $3.70"
Weekly share offering company. I know this company for 3 years now and doing this all the time
"I believe TOPS canNOT make another direct offering this year. https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Co-Di/Direct-Public-Offerings.htmlBelow is part of the article. It is a bit confusing because one type of direct offering can offer up to 5 million dollars in shares but TOPS' offering was 6 million dollars. Another type (SB-1) can raise up to 10 million dollars but the total revenue of the company must not exceed 25 million dollars. TOPS had 66 million dollars in revenue in 2019.One thing is clear in the article: no company can make another offering within a 12-month period of time. Here's part of the article.Companies interested in raising capital through a DPO have several options from which to choose. The most common type of DPO is known as a Small Corporate Offering Registration, or SCOR. The SEC provided this option to small businesses in 1982, through an amendment to federal securities law known as Regulation D, Rule 504. SCOR gives an exemption to private companies that raise no more than $1 million in any 12-month period through the sale of stock. There are no restrictions on the number or types of investors, and the securities can be freely traded. The SCOR process is easy enough for a small business owner to complete with the assistance of a knowledgeable accountant and attorney. It is available in most states.A related type of DPO is outlined in SEC Regulation D, Rule 505. This option enables a small business to sell up to $5 million in stock during a 12-month period to an unlimited number of investors, provided that no more than 35 of them are non-accredited. To be accredited, an investor must have sufficient assets or income to make such an investment. According to the SEC rules, individual investors must have either $1 million in assets (other than their home and car) or $200,000 in net annual personal income, while institutions must hold $5 million in assets. A DPO registered through Regulation D, Rule 506, allows a company to sell unlimited securities to an unlimited number of investors, provided that no more than 35 of them are non-accredited. Under Rule 506, investors must be sophisticated, or able to evaluate the merits and understand the risks of the transaction. In both of these options, the securities cannot be freely traded.Another type of DPO is outlined in SEC Regulation A. This option is frequently referred to as a ""mini public offering,"" because it follows many of the same procedures as an IPO and the securities may be freely traded. However, companies choosing this option may only offer up to $5 million in securities in any 12-month period. Regulation A offerings are allowed to bypass federal SEC registration and instead are filed with the Small Business Office of the SEC.Two further types of DPOs are available to businesses with less than $25 million in annual revenues. A Small Business Type 1 (SB-1) offering enables a company to sell up to $10 million in securities in a 12-month period and has simpler paperwork. A Small Business Type 2 (SB-2) filing enables a company to sell an unlimited amount of securities and has more difficult paperwork.A final type of DPO is available through the SEC's intrastate filing exemption, Rule 147. This option allows companies to raise unlimited funds through the sale of securities as long as the stock is sold only in the primary state in which they do business. Both the company and all the investors must be residents of the same state. This exemption is intended to provide local businesses with a means of raising capital within their locale.Any comments are welcomed. I certainly don't want to be stuck in a direct offering and it looks like if I invest in TOPS or SHIP this year that cannot legally happen."
just a heads up! read the news they will come out with RS any time soon!
I hope that everyone has a wonderful three day weekend. Stay safe & Stay healthy.....
"man all the bullish new investors in this stock are hilarious. you might think that this company might be profiting off of oil storage, Morgan Stanley, the sale of the new ship, or whatever else. the truth is, you dont know this stock, the company or its intentions in how it truly makes money. it's a long story and I wont get into it but this is the worst possible stock to invest in.

"Inflation is the friend of global shipping. They all operate on a model of cash flow paying the monthly payment on huge debt. So the leverage is very high. It's almost like buying a nonexpiring call option on inflation. When commodity prices go up, those who need to move them from A to B have more capital to bid up shipping services. Look at BDI lately and you will see what I mean. TOPS has put in a double bottom. Just buy a few thousand shares and hold tight."

Looking very solid at the moment. The weak hands are being bought out.
Company thinking to reverse split again . Company issue more shares to trap to innocent stock holder
So it seems TOPS has found a loophole in their non-binding agreement with shareholders and are now issuing warrants to purchase shares at .01 per share. It allows TOPS to gain revenue without issuing shares. The holders of the warrants when exercised increased the outstanding shares. (Brilliant)

Tanker rates surprisingly resilient.

"NASDAQ sent a warning out Dec 27 that TOPS was not in compliance with the stock not be at or over $1 for 30 consecutive days. The company issued a statement that a reverse split was an option to deal with it. And that was the end of it, then. I have seen NASDAQ extend compliance for 180 days. Now it has been 90 calendar days since the warning. I don't think TOPS wants the stock to reach compliance. NASDAQ has been quite patient. Someone or some group of people killed that chance beginning at 7AM this morning."
tops should be at 9 right now... at this price level I will keep buying!!!
I lost 80% of my money in less than 6 months on this tops stocks . I can’t imagine the people that buy this tops stocks 2 year ago !
man you bulls on this stock are hilarious. the stock offerings are to buy ships owned by entities affiliated with Pistolis. let that sink in. he is paying himself with stockholder money. you think this will benefit the stockholder in the long term? lol...it never has. this company has never reported positive earnings. common sense.
SHORT IT ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN TO .15 PPS & THEN COMES PISTIOLIS' NEXT REVERSE STOCK SPLIT
"Chief Executive Officer, Evangelos Pistiolis, has today purchased an aggregate of 100,000 common shares of the Company in the open market.In addition, the Company announced that for a period of 12 months following the date of this release:(i) it will not conduct any equity offerings, public or private;(ii) it will not conduct any reverse stock splits;(iii) it will not pay any bonuses to its executive management; and(iv) it will enter into a standstill agreement with Family Trading Inc., the holder of all of the Company’s outstanding Series E Preferred Shares and a company affiliated with its CEO, pursuant to which Family Trading will agree not to convert any of its Series E Preferred Shares into common shares, other than in connection with a change of control of the Company.(v) CEO and his affiliates will not sell any shares.The Company believes that the above actions will significantly enhance the trading stability of its common shares during the next 12 months.will this stock go up?"
"This stock is headed in the right direction......to reach that ALL TIME HIGH of $4.3 TRILLION a share!Everyone is so excited.....the island, the yachts, the high tech vehicles, the clothes, the exotic foods,the 'everything' house, and, of course, the babes. Every race to satisfy even the hardest to pleasebuddy. Ohhhhh, the folks can't wait!"
Its almost about time for an issuance of new stoack and a reverse split. Only .28 cents more to go and then it happens. I cant beleive this stock is still above $1.00. I have no idea why this fraud has not been delisted!
"Don't you guys know that the $750 target that was often discussed before the 1:10 split is now $7,500? With another 1:10 split it will become $75,000. The reverse splits re how it grew to $750 from a couple of bucks in the first place."
"I suspect that TOPS is desparate to retain their NYSE listing, and they are perilously close to being delisted on the basis of a too small market cap. SDLP was delisted last week for having a deficient market equity level.Unfortunately, for TOPS the doubling of the share count today was met by the street by a halving of their share price. So, there was no net benefit as concerns the NYSE listing requirements.of course, shareholders of yesterday are now diluted by 50%"
"Man, how many consecutive stock offerings can they do? I'm not invested in this but it's a really bad joke for any investor!"
I think all the negativity about TOPS bodes well for the future stock price.

"They are back to their old tricks again. Another reverse split is scheduled for this Monday. They have been doing this for over 16 years. Dilute then reverse... over and over again. To put into perspective just how many times they have been doing this reverse split dance.. TOPS would have to climb to 230,000,000 dollars a share for an investor from 2004 just to break even. Yes, you read that correctly.....230m dollars a share. If you don't believe me look at the historical chart and you will see. Caveat Emptor."

Right now, there are 17k shares showing on the 1.50 bid and 1k showing on the ask. If that bid size starts to fall, you might want to think about taking 1.50 while you still can... Now only 16k on the bid and 1k on the ask... Just trying to help."
dont buy tops never ever
"everyone bullish. I know some of you newbies to this stock think that this company is going to turn a new leaf and start rewarding shareholders after years of reversing stock splits and never any profits reported. listen carefully. some of us have thoroughly examined their quarterly and annual statements for years. they funnel profits out into private companies in the form of management fees, labor, evem financing, etc. they have created multiple shell private companies to come up with as many ways to spend their profits and funnel money out. this has been their model for years as well as other Greek shipping companies such as drys. if you plan to buy, do not become a bag holder. I do not recommend keeping this stock for over 24 hours if you are feeling like gambling."
"BF, don't look now but you currently ""have a return"" of only .5% which is NOT a great return ""even for a calendar year"" :("
"Just remember, the stock market is going to be closed tomorrow for Good Friday, so there could be a lot of selling today, so don't be surprised if TOPS heads down towards .20. Hope everyone has a wonderful day, stay safe & stay healthy.."

"I saw the bid drop below .20 in the premarket this morning. Anyone with 20 cents could have printed a trade in the teens if they had wanted to. It might mean nothing but it could indicate that the natural support at the even dime is weakening. If you have to be long, I recommend setting a stop at .1899, because if it breaks .20 and then breaks the .19 bid, it will probably fall at least to .18 and very likely lower."

"PAYtience people. TOPS is one of the largest oil tanker companies in the world and there's ONLY so many of them out there. The CEO doesn't seem extremely trustworthy, but look at what they've been doing compared to the present state of the world. Share offerings like crazy, to raise money for more ships. Oil is in surplus right now and the refineries are barely running, so until the world opens back up, this will remain down. When the OK is given, and it will be before Christmas(too much $$ to be lost by politicians) and the refineries turn back on, these will start to move again. Right now they're just sitting there. However, if you've ever shipped a chemical in your life, they collect what's called Demurrage when they can't off-load that chemical/substance. Oil does the same. I confirmed this with a friend in the industry. The CEO has been building a bigger fleet and wouldn't be doing it, if future business wouldn't be there. So just relax and keep adding shares. This will reverse split after they begin to move and will go back to the glory days. What, are we never gonna use oil again?"

Looks like consolidation before another move up. At least it looks like it.
The market makers remarked the stock price again today after a solid week. Is the market that weak again today?

"Here is another opinion why this stock should be avoided at all costs...""TOP ShipsLast month, I didn't shy away from calling Greek petroleum shipping company TOP Ships (NASDAQ:TOPS) ""the absolute worst stock that Robinhood investors love."" Not only would I stand by that statement today, but I'd double down on it.For many years, TOP Ships has relied on common stock issuances to put cash in its coffers and fund the purchase of shipping vessels and its day-to-day operations. That's because the heyday for petroleum shipping companies occurred prior to the Great Recession. Most shipping companies, including TOP Ships, have been struggling to avoid an industrywide vessel glut for a decade.But TOP Ships is an extreme case. The company has reverse split its stock on 10 occasions over the past 12 1/2 years, including seven reverse splits since May 2017. The company's management team has a habit of generating cash by selling stock and ballooning its shares outstanding. These steps drive down the company's share price to mere pennies, prompting the company to enact a reverse split to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq stock market. Laughably, the company's reverse-split-adjusted all-time high, set back in 2004, is now $4,562,459,852.800.00 a share. That's $4.56 trillion a share!Since announcing its intent to reverse split on Aug. 7 (the split took effect on Aug. 10), TOP Ships has shed nearly 50% of its value and is once again in danger of falling below the $1 minimum share price required for continued listing on the Nasdaq. Despite this, TOP Ships is the 51st-most-held stock on Robinhood. Even if the company doesn't go bankrupt, management's persistent dilution and penchant for reverse splits could completely wipe out shareholders.""Caveat Emptor. GLTA."

"Here we go, 30,000 at the bid for 1.42"
I bought at 3.. HELP
"Next offering will be at 10 cents. $5M . Sometime next week. Final one before RS I would guess.. all the offering, they never hold it. They first sell as much and once it reaches like 40-50M, they finance it to cover at deep discount and while we are all buying at down fall think investors bought at that price, they start off loading the next set which eventually will be at 20-30% of the average sell price or market price.. after RS, this will crash like 80% and that will be time to get back in my opinion for getting a better chance of winning this gamble. Remember the odds are still lesser than Vegas.!!!"
TOPS DOWN 99.9% FROM $30 MILLION PPS REVERSE SPLIT ADJUSTED IN 7/13...SHORT ANY POP JUST LIKE IF YOU TO WANT TO BECOME A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE
"I don't believe they will go bust but I do believe they will need to further dilute shareholders. They will need to keep the stock price above $1 until the end of Fridays trading day in order to meet the nasdaq listing requirements. Thats why they announced the buyback. According to tops latest financial from June 30th they are currently running over a 20 million working capital deficit and they have over 200 million in capital needs over the next 18 months, in order to clear the deficit and new build program. since the filing they have raised 15.9 million in capital in July from one dilution round. What I believe is happening is they will try to keep the stock above $1 for the next few days. After they meet the nasdaq listing requirements, Then they will start to raise capital again through share holder dilution to manage the working capital deficit and capital for new builds."
I’ll take this consolidation phase.
Tops ceo have offshore accounts.and are in the business to short their stock.look at the charts year after year after year.they are makeing a fortune

I think the offering start coming on this month after 1 year promised expire
"Never trust these Greek shipping companies, they simply operate by doing constant dilution and reverse splits. SHIP, TOPS both have the same model. Maybe ok to get a nickel profit but holding it for long is a recipe for disaster."
How many times Company can do a revert reverse split?
THOSE THAT SHORTED THE TOPS REVERSE STOCK SPLIT COUNTERFEIT MONEY OPERATION DOWN FROM $30 MILLION PPS REVERSE SPLIT ADJUSTED SINCE 7/13 HAVE ALL BECOME MULTI-MILLIONAIRES
History repeats itself look at a year to date chart.
"Extremely undervalued. #TOPS owns over 100 tankers, a tanker costs around ~$110,000 to rent per day. The price range is $110million ~$240million per tanker vessel. #MakeGreeceGreatAgain The all-time high closing price for #TOPS was $4,336,963,821,802.30 on November 26, 2004."
they only have 1 full time employee and it's Ray apparently
"Getcha popcorn ready... who in there right mind is holding this stock in the current country’s condition. I can think of a million other stocks to hold right now... give it a couple of days, hours, or even a week before everyone sells for a huge loss"
"shares bottoming at 0.45...for now.R/S coming soon, and that event will be accompanied by an update on their operations, their NAV discount, their backlog, and earnings ability on their new ECO fleet .If they do a 1 for 10 split, the shares would re-rate at 4.5, and if the past is any lesson would then likely fall as a first reaction based on the ongoing fear of further dilution.To prevent that from happening, CEO would need to affirm that they have met their capital needs, have restructured, and are for all practical purposes emerging as the most modern, cost effective Products/Suezmax player. They would then have to back that by announcing a share buy-back, or up to 20% of outstanding shares (only about $3M).Basedon their Sept 2018 presentation, the shares currently are trading at about 10% to 20% of NAV. Even the more depressed shippers, not many having the TOPS backlog (over $200M), trade at 50% NAV.So, a ""fair value' pre-split is in the $1 to $2 range (or $10 to $20 range post split 1 for 10)"
One year chart looks good! Higher lows
