the train is slowly moving and about to take off :) the jump into 2+ is coming up lads :)
"This stock is headed in the right direction......to reach that ALL TIME HIGH of $4.3 TRILLION a share!Everyone is so excited.....the island, the yachts, the high tech vehicles, the clothes, the exotic foods,the 'everything' house, and, of course, the babes. Every race to satisfy even the hardest to pleasebuddy. Ohhhhh, the folks can't wait!"
Looking good!! The NAKD guys loves TOPS too...
great company. this thing should go to 9 in no time...
tops should be at 9 right now... at this price level I will keep buying!!!
Based on the trend next level should be 1.70. We shall see
I heard about TOPS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Itâ€™s looking like an interesting play.
"Rally in the making, give it 1 month, $3.70"
"Inflation is the friend of global shipping. They all operate on a model of cash flow paying the monthly payment on huge debt. So the leverage is very high. It's almost like buying a nonexpiring call option on inflation. When commodity prices go up, those who need to move them from A to B have more capital to bid up shipping services. Look at BDI lately and you will see what I mean. TOPS has put in a double bottom. Just buy a few thousand shares and hold tight."
The reality is the world still needs oil and they ship it in a modern fleet so I am bullish. If you sold in the 147 range I think you made a mistake.
I think the offering start coming on this month after 1 year promised expire
"Oil, gas and coal stocks are soaring. How do companies plan to get it to Europe and China. On Ships. $ship is a bargain at $1.26 today. Buying opportunity and cheaper than $tops"
"The all-time high TOP Ships stock closing price was $4,336,963,821,802.30 on November 26, 2004 let's go Sell @1M "
"If there is a harsh winter, product tankers which have not benefited from the near end of Covid stand to gain:""Nothing warms product tanker carriers like a cold winter in the Northern Hemisphere where the majority of the world's population resides.It's always been that way, but October 2021 stands out for multiple reasons. In part, the world has stumbled into an unexpected energy crisis, short on gas and coal, and in part, an upturn in the market fueled by freezing temperatures could kick off the long-awaited business that product tanker carriers have been eagerly awaiting.The carriers as well as crude oil freighters are largely the only two segments in shipping that aren't benefiting from the major progress generated by the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.Hence why executives from a number of dominant shipping companies unanimously projected that it is a matter of time before the upturn extends to their sector, and that a cold winter could accelerate the development.With a shortage of gas in the UK and a shortage of coal in India, the population isthe population is likely to switch to old-fashioned generators to stay warm, which will require refined oil products such as petroleum.""As long as that happens, we have tailwinds""In addition, a number of Western economies are well on their way in terms of vaccines, so much so that travel restrictions are being lifted, which will pave the way for the use of air fuel again. That said, the estimated level of commercial air travel remains 20 percent below 2019 levels, according to the Capital Links conference last week.But as Torm CEO Jacob Meldgaard pointed out, demand for refined oil products has been higher than the supply since June of this year. In August, it was so high that it drained inventories of 3 percent.""As long as that happens, we have tailwinds."""
huge key level breakout at 50 sma ($1.67) pricepoint!
One year chart looks good! Higher lows
this stock has done 10 reverse splits in the last 14 years you guys are on the wrong boat .JUMP ON THE STOCK SHIP
Just waiting for the calls for the stock to go under a dollar as they have every time the stock goes down.
"Never trust these Greek shipping companies, they simply operate by doing constant dilution and reverse splits. SHIP, TOPS both have the same model. Maybe ok to get a nickel profit but holding it for long is a recipe for disaster."
Did anyone else notice that TOPS sold one of their tankers for 6.9 million eight days before reporting earnings if 1.7 million. HummHappy trading
