The NYC deal has got to be a huge win and getting EVBG the attention they deserve. Glad to see that it has finally pushed past the resistance at 30. Next stop 40?

Technicals indicate this one is going to fall.
How is this stock still so low ($15.14)? Who is willing to sell at this price? It was unanimously given a buy rating by all analysts covering this stock when the quiet period ended the day before yesterday... and an average target price of $20.50 with nobody giving it less than $19. Their market cap vs their earnings is incredibly low compared to the vast majority of other recent tech ipos. Am I missing something here? Everbridge seems extremely undervalued to me.
what's causing the dips lately? i wonder if this will start recovering next week
"Net margin -34%. Revenues up 33% YoY, but loss doubled. Increased revenues should bring greater operating effectivness, if not, than the business model is not viable."
I've been waiting for this integration a long time... Deloitte’s EMEA Cybersphere Center and Everbridge Establish Corporate Partnership to Deliver Turnkey Security Managed Service Across Digital and Physical Critical Events. Awesome news!

The train has left the station. Next stop $60...get on as soon as you can.
My average on this is $18. Any advise on - should I hold or sell?
Did this stock fall out of favor? The price has been a dead log floating on water This is a very good company. Any thoughts?
