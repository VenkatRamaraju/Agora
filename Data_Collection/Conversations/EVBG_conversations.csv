Every sale is good. The LA deal is especially good.
How is this stock still so low ($15.14)? Who is willing to sell at this price? It was unanimously given a buy rating by all analysts covering this stock when the quiet period ended the day before yesterday... and an average target price of $20.50 with nobody giving it less than $19. Their market cap vs their earnings is incredibly low compared to the vast majority of other recent tech ipos. Am I missing something here? Everbridge seems extremely undervalued to me.
Technicals indicate this one is going to fall.
