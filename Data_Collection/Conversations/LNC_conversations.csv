Zack's has strong sell. Gosh who writes this stuff. Where have they been from March to March I have seen my LNC go from 16 to 58. Nice run year to date from 48 to 58. Increase dividend a bit also.Interest rates rising so will LNC.

BOOM. Shares bought at 30.8 6 weeks ago look awesome now. Told you.
Why down almost 12% after hours?
Lincoln National reached a 52 Week high at 75.39
Mixed bag quarterly results. Some wins and some losses; combinging into a quarterly loss; which should be nonrecurring going forward. The problem is when adjusted they made $2.22/share which is $0.20 lower than wall street projected. I'll hold onto my shares; but I am not happy with their failure to meet projections. They are trading at a forward PE of 6.9x; and far below book. Their downward exposure is limited.
This stock fell almost 20% in a month; even though quarterly numbers were very good. Massive overresponse to a a quarter point reduction by the FED. This company is going to make over $10 EPS in 2020; which translates into a forward PE of 5.6x's; plus a dividend. This is a hugely undervalued company.
"Did anyone see the AH price of today, and if so, could you interpret it for me."
"Treasuries rising. 10-year bond up 4.75% today to 1.257 was down to 0.54 a few months ago. Rising rates is a great thing for these insurance companies as well as the banks. That with stock market performance still rising, we are definitely going to see $60 very soon this year. Love the dividend also."
"LNC is a BUY for 2020 return.........Only a President Warren can mess it up and cause stock not to return 20%+ in my opinion.From Transcript:"" We're also successfully executing on our digital program and diligently managing expenses, which were down 3% compared to the prior-year quarter. Net savings from our digital program should begin to ramp up next year and, along with further Liberty integration savings, provide a tailwind to earnings in the medium term.Lastly, our diversified and attractive business mix enables us to consistently generate a significant amount of cash flow, which we are both investing in growth and returning to shareholders. Our active share buyback program led to an 8% decrease in shares outstanding compared to the prior year. And last night, we announced an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend."""
"LNC continues to make me so much money!!!! Great corporate moves with reinsurance and this is with very low interest rates. When rates go back up they will make more funds on all of their reserves/investments.Again, love the dividend also."
"The PE and growth rate of LNC made it look attractive for me so I bought today. It appears from the discussion that the stock moves on interest rate cuts, so hopefully we get back to a normal economy that can sustain 3%-5% fed funds rate. I'd like to ask the community how another 1/4 point rate cut will affect Lincoln Financial?"
Geeezzz this thing is undervalued now - time to double down.
"I cant believe this is getting beaten up so bad today. it beat earnings in Q1, is posting a dividend in a few days and will do just fine in Q2. Who cancels life insurance during a pandemic!?Anyway just bought a few hundred shares today at $34.87. Looking forward to the rebound! This stock is a no-brainer at this price IMO"
"Loving it. Boom, Boom, Boom. 10-yr bond up 1.98% today to 1.389 which is a fair piece from 0.54 a few months ago. New VUL with better guarantees and crossing fingers on this one that Covid is easing. LNC even raised my dividend 0.08 per year."
LNC will be above $70 by earnings time.....Then UP $2 after earnings.....Look at PGR today so HUGE move coming for LNC!
LNC like energizer bunny. keeps going and going.Reinsurance deal is huge. Can write tons more moneyguard and no-lapse UL policies now.Great move by a great company. Thanks LNC more making me tons of money.
"LNC now made me more than MRNA. Long on both but LNC is less worrisome.Great dividend, company, and future."
"So I can definitely say I told you so. From 30.8 to 50.91 in 2 months. 65% !!!!!Thank you to the horrible analyst for pushing this one down for me. LNC has been around since 1905, survived the great depression, the great recession, and will continue to prosper. As interest rates go back up over the next 2 years, this stock will really pop. You can take that to the bank!!!!! LNC ROCKS!!!!"
"54.73, BOOM!!!!! Only one regret. I bought 1,000 shares at 30.8 and now wish I bought 2,000.LNC will continue to climb. Great annuity products, great life rates, group products, and the best LTC single pay product on the market. Moneyguard is their premiere LTC product and with CD's paying less than 1%, Moneyguard looks awesome for a way to put money aside for LTC. I bought for myself and spouse. That's what got me juiced about their stock. Long term hold for me and I love the dividend."
