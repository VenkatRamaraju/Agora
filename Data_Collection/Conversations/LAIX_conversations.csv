"Looks like the Pump is broken, people. Nobody buying in the after hours. This is becoming boring. Short interest is down, no more Reddit interest in this. If there was an acquisition or something brewing, we wouldn't be staring at a screen with no volume after hours. It's over."
Congratulations guys. Stock hit $8.80 and we’ve doubled our money as predicted yesterday
financial looks to be headed in the right direction 
TIME TO GET OUT BOYS. DON'T HOLD OVER THE WEEKEND.
Send SP to 9!!!
LAIX is up 9.29% to $8.59

What is he reason it is going so much up?
All rights guys. Get your buy orders in at this current price of 4.40 and don’t sell for anything less than double which is where it is predicted to be tomorrow morning
so bizarre how people can make this jump to likely 1000% in a few hours
LAIX is down 5.18% to $11.90

Looks like we filled a good portion of the gap created about 3 weeks ago. Sitting right at the 30 day MA. Nice overall trend from 1/20. I think the last few weeks of ugly is over. Adding here. I like what this company is doing.
LAIX reached a new All Time Low at $10.59
rocket sighted!!!!!
"Folks, this was a classic pump and dump aided by computer trading. Between 2-2:15pm it traded 800,000 shares and the price never moved more than six cents. The computer is basically buying and selling to itself, hoping to entice you in. Please stop thinking these Chinese stocks that pop up everyday have some humanity changing technology that warrants a stock going from $2 -20 overnight. You will lose 90% of the time,"
"THERE IS NO MERGER. People are misconstruing a stock exchange merger in China as having something to do with this company. ""China Securities Regulatory Commission approves merger of Shenzhen exchange’s main board, SME board. The move is aimed at simplifying the structure of trading at the bourse, regulator says"""
Oh yes Oh yes. filled in my order. Lets fly now baby. So many great Catalyst coming this way!!!
Why such a low volume and price falling? I just bought a ton of shares.
"7 million volume today that's the pump now tomorrow comes the dump, be careful the writing is on the walls"
setting to cut my losses if it drops much lower. going back to sleep for 45 minutes and we'll see
Spam

"Hi Brad, Can you tell me please what are the good news?"
Guys why are you buying laix anything special happened?
Does anyone know what the % short interest is or what the float is? I think a lot of people are shorting this stock.
As it drops see if selling pressure continues and how many people hold it and it turns to buys until that happens nobody knows when bleeding will stop the news is really bad here
Time to buy again
$4.50 RESISTANCE COLLAPSED.
me tomorrow !
"Sold at open, made $ then got back in after drop with profits. Down, but net even- can now let this ride until green."
Why am I not seeing any conversation on this company! It doesn't look too bad. Hoping to get some insight from some discussion surrounding it.
This Is Going To Give The Shorts A Very Tight Sphincter!!
Buy buy strong buy Chinese fruits & vegetables not good this kind stock who bought 11 done will be under $4
"I like this stock , she is undervalued"
The Chinese are reinvesting due to the new low. All their discords are are flooded with ppl who are pumping this back up. I dont have money in this but I will definitely buy 10k shares Monday morning and go with the pump.
What's up guys? What's the buzz on this stock this morning?
"no one in this board , after the result can see 50 posts per day ,,,,sure"
third comment
Why is this keep on going down? There are that many shorts on this?
"Ride the momentum with their competitor $LAIX, surely will be pumped and dumped today early just like $WAFU, at least that one hasn't run much yet"
Can we get to 3 today 
"@kevin, who are you talking too?"
Same old story :-/
I thought it would soar toward $3...what is happening?
Anyone else wants to dislike my comment of going 20 ?
big day today
"Technical indicators daily - strong buy,what do you think guys is it time to buy?"
After 10.30 Am more dumping cause Chinese stocks alway after 10.30
A company that has online education services and its sales are dropping during Covid while every other online services are going up in sales tells the true tale of a company going out of business. Bye bye LAIX!!
Closing price today?

Tomorrow should be fun
Is this a Chinese company
Is this going higher today? I noticed this hit 11 in early 2021

I heard about LAIX the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Guys, let's be adults about people who lost money on this stock. I see a lot of people making fun of those who lost money. I'm sure it could happen to any one of us. Please be considerate and only provide constructive criticism, not insults and sarcasm."
Do you guys ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just wrote about LAIX
This one will double between 1 pm and 2 pm EST

this is 100 dollar stock. with in 2022 it will reach 100

second comment
Like Aacg yesterday?
The company is almost bankrupt. Clearly stated in the last few reports that they will run out of cash Q3 and need a really big cash infusion. They are barely alive after slashing the number of employees to the bone. In the last few months several rumblings from CCP about how these edu-tech companies were going to face heavy regulation very soon. So what made anyone think this turd was worth holding on to?
"i had to sell for a loss then shorted to recover some of my loss, but I know how it works, once I short it rips."
LAIX is up 8.36% to $8.94
There is definitely something going on. The leak is out. The question is; does it deserve so much?
Chart down trend no looking good for the close
shorties losing money every minute... keep it up guys... dont listen to people lile kevin... lets goooo. hold ur nervesss...
"METX look today... with LAIX will happens the same, total recovery. Just wait and see."
China trying to block education stocks from using USA stocks out of country money can’t be used to run business this is why laix could hit .10 all over CNBC this news because they don’t want them to use money not in there country that’s why this thing laix fell so much nobody knows if anybody will start buying or do we go to .10 by end of week
"I bought LAIX just before it started declining, just like AMC. HELP!"
LAIX reached a 52 Week high at 8.20
Who will be the lucky after lunch runner $METX $LIZI OR $LAIX??

"I have no idea why but this is supposedly the reason why this stock when up according to TDAmeritrade. ""Shares of LAIX Inc. (NYSE: LAIX) got a boost, shooting 138% to $6.08 following a report a Chinese securities regulator approved the merging of two exchanges, Shenzhen's main board and the small- to medium-enterprise board."""
LAIX has a twin..METX is also up but has more room to run IMO

I'm very interested about this.
Are any of your investing in this stock duped by a wechat girls?

LET THE PUMPING BEGIN!!!!!
tolddd you. time to go back up... 15$ this time...

what is the news on this anyway?
once it touches 8$. no stopping from there.
RESISTANCE AT $4.50 FAILING. RETREATING TO $4
We’ve got a runner here. Another low float with potential squeeze. Pm hits $1.50 looks like $2 is real which would trigger a small squeeze around $2.80
LAIX reached a new All Time Low at $7.95
this thing is dropping so fast my stop order can't even execute
Who else think we could see 15$ today?
looks like $7 isn't happening again today
LAIX is AACG yesterday
Sold at the top and bought back higher so now we HOLD!
This stock will net touch even $5 but I am sure under $4 will soon end of day
Could hit 0 laix because of China making it non profit can’t use there funds money on business in USA people say what’s the news it’s worse news possible on China’s stocks going down big time this could go all the way to .10

Ready to run high and fast. Low float locked and loaded. Volume to price highly favorable to longs. Great technology and market.
WOWW! Just bought another 1000 shares. Going to be $15 at least.
Also forgot to say one thing nonprofit they want educational stocks to do besides the factor that no outside money can be used from China to help pay to operate it they blocking it so the stock means nothing to them China is causing the big drop and I’m not sure what to do myself probably should sell but I’m holding still hoping bleeding stops at some point but this impact I’m not sure nobody knows when it will stop or what level so it could go to 0 or some people call it a bluff by China and they do nothing at the end time will tell but nobody has the answer here how low she will go wait and see but it cooks get really ugly before it gets good here
Expect profit taking tomorrowNothing is going on here except insiders pump
