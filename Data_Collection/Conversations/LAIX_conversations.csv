Bad news from the NYSE. Reverse stock split?
We’ve got a runner here. Another low float with potential squeeze. Pm hits $1.50 looks like $2 is real which would trigger a small squeeze around $2.80
"Negligible chance to go back up to $2, zero chance to go back up to $4. If it bounces back to $1.50, short like crazy and double your money."
I heard about LAIX the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Another chicom manipulated stock with zero or fake news. Made 10k+ on AACG yesterday. Luv it keep them coming!
$LAIX the same scenario check the chart no body win
Merger news is coming. Set limits to $20
This will go plus 20 dollars either tomorrow or next week watch
"Guys, let's be adults about people who lost money on this stock. I see a lot of people making fun of those who lost money. I'm sure it could happen to any one of us. Please be considerate and only provide constructive criticism, not insults and sarcasm."
what is the new news? if there any chance to bullish 2$?
"I have no idea why but this is supposedly the reason why this stock when up according to TDAmeritrade. ""Shares of LAIX Inc. (NYSE: LAIX) got a boost, shooting 138% to $6.08 following a report a Chinese securities regulator approved the merging of two exchanges, Shenzhen's main board and the small- to medium-enterprise board."""
Guys why are you buying laix anything special happened?
"Folks, this was a classic pump and dump aided by computer trading. Between 2-2:15pm it traded 800,000 shares and the price never moved more than six cents. The computer is basically buying and selling to itself, hoping to entice you in. Please stop thinking these Chinese stocks that pop up everyday have some humanity changing technology that warrants a stock going from $2 -20 overnight. You will lose 90% of the time,"
All rights guys. Get your buy orders in at this current price of 4.40 and don’t sell for anything less than double which is where it is predicted to be tomorrow morning
"I bought LAIX just before it started declining, just like AMC. HELP!"
Who else think we could see 15$ today?
"Technical indicators daily - strong buy,what do you think guys is it time to buy?"
pump
"Baudax Bio Director Winston Churchill Buys $63,000.00 in BXRXBXRX was the number 1 gainer in AH , will run to $1 tomorrow $SPRT $NURO $LAIX"
China trying to block education stocks from using USA stocks out of country money can’t be used to run business this is why laix could hit .10 all over CNBC this news because they don’t want them to use money not in there country that’s why this thing laix fell so much nobody knows if anybody will start buying or do we go to .10 by end of week
