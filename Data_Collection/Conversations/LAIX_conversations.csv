The company is almost bankrupt. Clearly stated in the last few reports that they will run out of cash Q3 and need a really big cash infusion. They are barely alive after slashing the number of employees to the bone.

"Folks, this was a classic pump and dump aided by computer trading. Between 2-2:15pm it traded 800,000 shares and the price never moved more than six cents. The computer is basically buying and selling to itself, hoping to entice you in. Please stop thinking these Chinese stocks that pop up everyday have some humanity changing technology that warrants a stock going from $2 -20 overnight. You will lose 90% of the time,"
