Looks Good But Banks Are Not In Favor Now.
This Bank Should Have Been Sold A Year Ago. They Think They Are Going To Be The Next J.P. Morgan. They Are A Couple Of Hundred Years Behind. Using Bank As Their Personal A.T.M..
I have owned FNB stock for quite a few years and keep the stock in my portfolio because of the continued dividends. This company doesn't disappoint. The stock helps rounds out a balanced portfolio. I've followed this company for years and am impressed with their growth and acquisition strategy. Management is smart and focused.
"FNB 2020 Q4 earnings report & conference call presentation can be found on their website in the INVESTORS section. FNB not very good at releasing financial information to the press.Q4 was OK, not great. Missed on revenue, beat on non-GAAP earnings. While improved, they still have some problems with loan deferrals/defaults. One reason for today's weakness may be due to their future guidance that 2021 revenue will be down from 2020. No growth, but they are doing a solid job of running the bank through the pandemic-related issues such as low interest rates and personal/business failures. No mention of dividend increase or share buybacks."
FNB-PE is down 25.49% to 17.86
I’m sticking to my $5 target
"banks closed in pgh pa, others open"
Management Should Have Sold The Company Instead Of Doing Acquisitions.
Don't normally see a stock up like this when exdividend
They Need To Find A Buyer. They Will Never Become A Major Banking Figure. Too Many Banks In The US. There Needs To Be A Consolidation. Too Many Banks Competing For Same Customers. Wake Up And Smell The Villa In Naples Florida.
I believe FNB is now a takeover target!

They Need To Stop Donating Money And Buy Back Shares. This Isn't A Charity It Is A Business That Needs To Take Care Of It's Stockholders.
PNC Is On The Prow. Will Others Follow And Take Out FNB?
So what's up with FNB today?
How About Taking Care Of SHAREHOLDERS?
FNB reached a 52 Week low at 10.12
Nice Report.
FNB reports 2020 Q4 earnings tonight 01/19 at 6PM EST. There is an earnings conference call tomorrow 01/20 at 8:15 AM EST. Directions to listen are on the FNB website in the Investors Relations section. Average earnings estimates are .24/share and $307M revenue.Look for future guidance & loan loss status to determine stock price movement.
Instead Of Donating Money They Should Be Buying Back Stock.
"They Need To Stop Giving Out These Hugh Stock Option Awards To The Directors. All They Do Is Show Up For The Meeting, Get A Nice Check And A Hugh Stock Option Award, Then Cash Them In As Soon As They Can. This Is Their ATM. They Do Nothing For The Company Other Than Agree With The CEO Whether He Is Right Or Wrong.. Their Companies Aren't Giving Their Directors These Kinds Of Options."
zacks says ......
Sell This Bank Now. The Board Members Will Be Real Rich Then. Didn't They Ever Think Of That. They Like To Go To The Board Meetings To Give Them Something To Do. They Should Put Bruce H. And Bill H. On The Board And See How Fast They Find A Buyer.
"Why Do The Directors Keep Giving Themselves All Of Those Options For Doing Nothing For The Shareholders? Maybe They Have ""Something"" On The CEO??"
Little confused is it FNB or FNB-PRE getting the $18.13 dividend?
5.6 Million For Accelerated Stock Grants Vesting. Baloney. Stop Giving Out Options Like They Are Candy. The Shareholders Are Paying For Them. They Need An Adult On The Board. How About Bill Hoyne? He Will Put An End To All Of This Garbage.

Sales And Earnings Are Very Good. Stock Is Down. Why Is C.E.O. Getting Hugh Stock Option Grants. Should Not Be That Much. How About Giving The Shareholders Some Of The Profits.
I Think The CEO And All The Directors Should Take A 50% Pay Cut. No More Options.
I read quite a number of negative comments about FNB that it is a scam. Could anyoneexplain why and what kind of scam? Thank you

What A Bunch Of Clowns Running FNB. They Should Be Removed For Not Being A Fiduciary Of FNB Stockholders. Yes Mr. Hoss You Will Be JUST FINE.
The dividend has been the same since 2009. This is a subpar return to the shareholders.
Why Hasn't Someone Made An Offer For FNB?
Looks Good.
FNB bout to take off
They Say $18.00 Per Share Then .45 Cents Per Depository Share. What Are They Saying?
"Yes, Yes And Yes. The CEO Is Doing A Good Job Or Is It Because Interest Rates Are Going Up? I Think We All Know The Answer."
"banks closed except by appt, other banks open as usual in pgh pa, not good, those that will thrive and those that will die, not a good start. emailed corp, will update."
I bought in today at $7.60 for a few thousand. Bank stocks are pretty beat up in this environment but so is my Utility. Seems like a good bank with decent numbers based on earnings. Took a chance and hoping once we are out of this depressive state of affairs bank stocks will go back up. Low rate environment is tough right now.
any jump expected from the better than results?

Time To Sell To Citizens Bank.
Don't Even Think About Giving More Zero Strike Options. Senior Mgmt. Should Take A 25% Pay Cut.
how does this company afford to pay $18.13 per share in dividend?
Why All Of The Volume?
"FNB Q2 earnings out. Earnings .25/share vs .12 expected. Revenue $306 Million vs $300 Million expected.Looks like they beat Q2 estimates easily, but no Q3 forward guidance yet. FNB was up by approx 5% to 7.90 in a small amount of after-hours trading."

PNC Or Citizens Should Buy Them Out. A lot Of Branches Overlapping?
"I think FNB's purchase of HBMD was not as wise move unless FNB fires all the HBMD management and puts new FNB management in place.FNB knows how to expand and make money while HBMD shows no leadership or good management imo.Baltimore, MD, is not exactly what I would call a good place to do business with it's crime levels so high and so many other problems in the city.JMO---"
I Wonder If They Are Thinking Of A Reverse Split. That Would Be The Worse Thing A Bank Could Do. Buy Back Some Stock To Get The Price Up. Come On Man. Borrow The Money If You Have To.

They had some interesting insights about FNB on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Take the Divy and be patient. Eventually will be swallowed by a larger bank like PNC

"So, we've just finished our 12th year with a .48c divided. And while I commend the team at FNB on the clock work precision they've managed to keep over the past 12 years, are we ever going to see the divided begin to increase back to the 2008, pre great-recession, levels of .96c? We don't need to get back there in one giant leap, but a nice orderly set of increases would be nice."

So Sad. The Chairman Should Fire The CEO And Replace The Whole Board But They Are Probably Related. Need Someone Who Knows How To Run A Bank.

"The balance sheet of HBMD does not reflect an institution worthy of a premium valuation. looking at the ownership suggests otherwise. Blackrock owns 907,297 shares and Vanguard owns 697,547 shares of HBMD. They are also two of the largest owners of FNB. It would be interesting to know any recent trades involving T. Rowe Price and Patriot Financing, two other major holders of HBMD. Looks like it works out exceptionally well for them, not so much for the rest of us unless we also owned HBMD. Sure solved a debt to equity ratio for them at our expense."

"I just analyzed FNB's 10 ""peer"" banks, and over the last 8 years since I've owned FNB's stock, it is the 2nd WORST performer with only a 17% increase in its stock price since over the eight years. The only worse performer was VLY. Given the flat earnings projected for 2018-20. the board of directors have to consider this underperformance and look at merging with an institution that can leverage FNB's footprint and grow its stock price.I'm embarrassed to say, but I've been invested is this dead-money stock, and it's time to liberate the shareholders."

Not A Bad Quarter. Need To Buy Back More Stock.
Yea. How About Taking Care Of The Shareholders. Reduce The Board Members Pay And Options By 80% And See How Many Of Them Stick Around. NONE!
Why Don't They Buy Back Some Stock. Something To Show That They Care About Stockholders And Not Just Lining Their Pockets With Our Money?
How About Supporting The Stockholders?

"Today Is The CEO's Last Day, Right? That Is Good. Need An Experienced Finance Person To Run This Bank. Well He Tried But He Failed."
Cannot imagine this bank stock not performing when the banking industry is on sound footing. Either it is poor results from recent mergers or management that cannot develop synergy and improve bottom line. Looks like North Carolina bankers who sold bank are back in banking business. There are problems with FNB C-Suite. Shake up or Sell out.Often issue is well compensated CEO and Management who do not care the shareholder expectations.
"I Hereby Officially Apologize To To Current Shareholders For Destroying Shareholder Value At An Amazing Rate. They Need To Sell Themselves Instead Of Buying Other Banks.

Instead Of Buying Other Banks They Could Have Sold To PNC But Too Late Now. Need A New CEO And Replace Complete Board. Bad Management.
FNB stock does not seem like a very robust currency to engage in M&A activity. But then again...Howard Bancorp has been a troubled institution. At least this deal could fortify FNB footings in/around Baltimore and DC.
Sold out for a small gain right before earnings to see how things played out with the numbers. Things look good so bought back in today on the drop.

Revenue estimates are $309M average, $295M low, $325M high.Quite a range on analyst's earnings estimates. IMO, FNB should be OK with the .23/share average.FNB also announced their next dividend payment. .12/share payable on 12/15, ex-dividend date is 12/3."

There is a great Q3 investor presentation on the FNB website in the Investor Relations section that contains detailed information about Q3 including loan breakdowns & loss reserves.The only negative that I saw was that FNB did not provide any future guidance for Q4. Too much uncertainty about the new stimulus plan & virus resurgence in the fall/winter months."
Can someone find me a bank stock that has performed worse than FNB over the last 5-7 years?
Keep the faith. once we get past covid this is going to 12/13 by EOY. solid dividend will continue.
