How About Taking Care Of SHAREHOLDERS?
"Nice Volume. Moving Up, Too."
@Frank Huge earnings. Still wondering how they would raise the dividend?
"FNB 2020 Q4 earnings report & conference call presentation can be found on their website in the INVESTORS section. FNB not very good at releasing financial information to the press.Q4 was OK, not great. Missed on revenue, beat on non-GAAP earnings. While improved, they still have some problems with loan deferrals/defaults. One reason for today's weakness may be due to their future guidance that 2021 revenue will be down from 2020. No growth, but they are doing a solid job of running the bank through the pandemic-related issues such as low interest rates and personal/business failures. No mention of dividend increase or share buybacks."
The dividend has been the same since 2009. This is a subpar return to the shareholders.
Yea. How About Taking Care Of The Shareholders. Reduce The Board Members Pay And Options By 80% And See How Many Of Them Stick Around. NONE!
"..""..... We're very pleased with an exceptional quarter where operating earnings per share grew 12% year-over-year to $0.29 per share. Tangible book value per share grew to nearly $7. Return on tangible common equity was again industry leading at nearly 18%, and the efficiency ratio improved by more than 200 basis points to 53%. The mix of the balance sheet also improved as total loans increased 8% annualized on a spot and average basis with strong performance in the Carolinas. On a linked-quarter annualized basis, total spot Carolina loans increased 8% driven by 10% growth in commercial loans. For the total company, loan growth was concentrated in commercial with very strong origination volumes across our footprint resulting in spot commercial loan growth of 11% and C&I growth of 29%. Total revenues increased 3% year-over-year excluding the impact of ..."""
"FNB Q2 earnings out. Earnings .25/share vs .12 expected. Revenue $306 Million vs $300 Million expected.Looks like they beat Q2 estimates easily, but no Q3 forward guidance yet. FNB was up by approx 5% to 7.90 in a small amount of after-hours trading."
I have owned FNB stock for quite a few years and keep the stock in my portfolio because of the continued dividends. This company doesn't disappoint. The stock helps rounds out a balanced portfolio. I've followed this company for years and am impressed with their growth and acquisition strategy. Management is smart and focused.
Time to raise the divvy to fifteen cents...
I read quite a number of negative comments about FNB that it is a scam. Could anyoneexplain why and what kind of scam? Thank you
Still like the company but the closing of stacks of branches wonders me if this is a sign of trouble.
How About Supporting The Stockholders?
What is the reason behind all bank financials going up so much today? GA election results?
"So, we've just finished our 12th year with a .48c divided. And while I commend the team at FNB on the clock work precision they've managed to keep over the past 12 years, are we ever going to see the divided begin to increase back to the 2008, pre great-recession, levels of .96c? We don't need to get back there in one giant leap, but a nice orderly set of increases would be nice."
Wells Fargo Still Likes Them.
@anonymous price always follows volume. Price won't budge until the big boys get what they want. That's why we have market makers.
here we go fellas...the pump is coming!
"I think FNB's purchase of HBMD was not as wise move unless FNB fires all the HBMD management and puts new FNB management in place.FNB knows how to expand and make money while HBMD shows no leadership or good management imo.Baltimore, MD, is not exactly what I would call a good place to do business with it's crime levels so high and so many other problems in the city.JMO---"
They had some interesting insights about FNB on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
