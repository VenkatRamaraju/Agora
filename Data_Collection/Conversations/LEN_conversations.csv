"Reuters 6/22/21;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in April proposed, among other measures, a new review process that would generally prohibit mortgage servicers from starting a foreclosure until after Dec. 31, 2021. The rule will throw a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of homeowners due to exit COVID-19 mortgage holiday or ""forbearance"" programs in coming months."
whats going on with hov Its been soaring
Earning on 9/20 should be perfect since even TOL posted a profit recently!LEN will make NAIL up 3X next week.
"No comments on here? Earnings tomorrow, what is the feeling on beat vs miss tomorrow?"
"Out LEN at $59.10 for another moderately successful Pure Earnings play. Used a Stop Limit once again to get out with a decent profit while trying, unsuccessfully, to ride this higher, through the 60's.. As usual, I celebrate EVERY victory, and this is another nice addition to my stock trading wallet, around a $1500 gain. It all adds up, folks! :-) Went Long on SMPL a few hours ago, 2500 shares at $27.76. They report earnings pre-market on Thursday, and I am expecting a very good earnings report accompanied by a pop up in the stock price. I am just a LITTLE bit less confident of this play than I have been of recent ones, and so I reduced my capital stake slightly. I could have bought up to 3000 shares with my hard capital, but decided to dial it down a bit, and went with 2500.Still confident of the play and looking for a pop to the $29.00 level. My only real concern is valuation, and how much of the current price might already be baked into the ER because of a raise in Guidance by the company between their last ER, and the one tomorrow. The risk/reward ratio is slightly less positive on this one, IMO.Best of Luck to All and hopefully somebody else made a few bucks on LEN. :-)"
"This was expected to make $0.45. Instead, it made $1.58. Why is this up only 5-6%?"
"I'm surprised that LEN is moving up for a second day in a row, even though the rest of the market is selling off based on rate fears. Should not LEN being hammered the worst?"
The death of retail could be an opportunity for Lennar to make and sell millennial demanded mid priced urban townhouses and condos at good margins aster picking up dying retail blocks at discounted prices
Lennar going huge in so cal.hey happy monday happy! follow me to Amzn
"Solid results. Congratulations to the Lennar. team.I’d be concerned if there was a slowdown in demand. If others want to sell off, that’s their prerogative. At this significant discounted price (in my opinion), I’m planning to buy more.I recommend that you do your own calculations, but per my workings, the trailing twelve month EPS now stands at $13.19. At today’s closing price of $98.30, the P/E now stands at approx 7.45. In my opinion, this valuation is unbelievably low and needs to be at least between 8.5 and 10, thus having a price between 112.11 and 131.9.Here’s my understanding:- Eye popping EPS OF $4.52 - Growth in Revenue - Increase in Orders for 4Q - Increase in Gross Margin, highest in the company’s history- increase in Net Margin, highest in the company’s history - Increase in selling price - Revenue per sq ft is up - Expense per sq ft is down - Increase in Deliveries of homes despite supply chain constraints - Other operating earnings $492 Million - Homebuilding cash $2.6 Billion - Early retirement of debt - Stock repurchase - Received upgrade from S&P - Executive Chairman expects to end 2021 on a very strong note - Underdelivered by 600 homes  (However, this is not due to a demand shortage, rather, because of supply chain constraints, which the entire industry is facing. As mentioned previously, I’d be concerned if there was a demand shortage.)"

"Another great quarter incoming, price of lumber peaked in between quarters, the fall and stabilization of lumber is great news for LEN. Margins continue to see a bounceback and sales are very strong. A volatile economy is going to allow buyers to take money from their holdings and use it to purchase bigger better homes. I think lennar will rebound today and I think these aforementioned points will send it up 5-7% after earnings."

"Inventory in metro Denver is the lowest it has ever been with just 1,200 homes on the market, according to Denver Metro Association of Realtors (DMAR).In January, homes stayed on the market just five days. That’s down from an average of 24 days in January 2020."
Why is Len suddenly dropping?
"There are barely any homes in the resale market. New construction is the only sustainable path forward.From Redfin""With more and more homes going off the market before buyers have had a chance to tour them, it has never been more important for homebuyers to be well prepared,"" said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather. ""That means setting alerts to let you know immediately when homes hit the market and going to see them ASAP or having a plan in place with your agent to make an offer sight-unseen. Buyers with flexibility on timing and location may also want to consider new construction, which made up 22% of homes for sale in December—the highest share on record. An advantage of homes sold by builders is that typically the price is the price, and they are sold on a first come, first served basis. So while you still need to be prepared to act quickly when a new-construction home becomes available, you don't have to worry so much about competing in a bidding war with escalating prices."""

I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Multistockalerts.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
So the company prioritized profits over revenue. Not sure how that is a problem. Better gross and net margins are always a positive sign. No wonder the company did a stock buyback. This company is focused on delivering shareholder value. I bought more today. Not selling at these levels.
...And they beat the earning again! :)
"What a ride, and here I thought it would end green today..."
JPM upgraded LEN today to Market Outperform with $83 price target. Yeehaw!!!!!!
CNBC housing report is a JOKE they blame interest rates for slow down at 3% or 4%=cheap builders have a large backlog not accepting new contracts lack of sites and increase in materials.
"Williamson - My cost is 42, and I have known the company since 1995. We need to educate some folks here. The three largest holders are the cream of the crop - Fidelity, Black Rock, and Vanguard. They hold 27% of the ""A"" shares. After that it drops off. sharply. Plenty of room for more institutional folks. At the latest report, only 3.0% of the ""A"" float was short, so by now we probably aren't getting much help from the folks not smart enough to have covered."
Apparently oversold...BUY

Gentlemen...why is this falling today? I haven't read any bad news about Len this week. appreciate your thoughts
"Could someone tell me, with an eps of more than 7, why is the price of this stock so low? RH has a slightly higher eps but it’s nearly 6 times as expensive. Do you see Len rising in the coming weeks?"
"Anyone think this will have a chance to approach $60 by the end of the week, seeing how the homebuilders are doing pretty good and they have earnings tomorrow?"
"Market’s peaked. Inflation, material Costs going up, & economic chickens coming home to roost. This is its height."
Overpriced greedy homebuilder. No commissions to real estate agents for their buyers. Will not show another Lennar home for years to come. Many new home sales agents have been let go. All this will come back and bite Lennar right where it hurts. Other homebuilders are still paying 2%-3%.
New all-time @ 102.17!!
"Will this do a KBH where it was up ~8% in AH's and then reversed to be down 8% during the day... I think that LEN is undervalued compared to KBH, so that probably won't happen here....to 50 today?"
Mario Gabelli increases his ownership. Hold tight!!
"It's entertaining to see how much this stock swings opposite of every tiny interest rate move. That is very largely a Pass Thru issue on to the customer. Add in that the moratorium has just been extended for renters / landlords, expect the same for mortgaged backed resident owners = ongoing inventory shortage"
"I don’t make the rules, but I believe that the current mechanism for valuing home builder stocks is outdated. LEN stock may have performed so much better if it belonged to any other industry group. Anyhow, it is what it is. I’m out of this stock after several months. Might revisit it in the future."
"JP Morgan raised today the estimated price from 115$ to 141$, and Evercore ISI from 121$ to 160$ Very bullish on this stock!"
"LEN is my choice for next Pure Earnings play. I plan to liquidate CMC late Monday or Tuesday, hopefully after an excellent pop to the upside on a very good Earnings Report, and immediately buy a lot of LEN shares, to hold through her Wednesday PM release. My analysis of this stock indicates a very good chance of a very good Earnings Report, beats on EPS and Revenue Consensus Estimates, along with good Guidance. If that happens, I expect a very positive reaction in the stock price, a pop to the upside of at least 5% and possibly even 8-10%. I LOVE the valuation of LEN right now. It is cheap at this price. I like the sector a lot. This company is very well established, it is managed well. The stock price, right now, is poised to move up on good news, and I think that good news will come on Wednesday before the market opens. I want to be in, I think the risk/reward ratio is excellent on this one. But of course I could be totally and completely wrong, so do your own research and analysis, and Best of Luck to All! :-)"

"The only people complaining about ""affordability"" are millennials who go to school for nonsense degrees in ""Gender Studies"" and end up working at Burger King for $11 per hour. Then, when their $200 per month phone bill comes due, they protest for $15 per hour. Sure, they buy $150 Nike's every 2 months. Sure they buy incrementally better $1200 iPhones. Sure they lease luxury cars for $800 per month so they can show off a Mercedes. But at the end they are dirt poor because of their own poor decisions in life and blame capitalism for being losers.

What pulled the rug out today??? I don't see any news about LEN for today!!
Amazing to see the fear stories trying to hold housing stox back. Higher costs will simply translate to higher housing prices & the Fed is committed to keeping rates tamped one way or another. The millennials want nothing to do with your parents house with the low ceilings & ugly green carpet..

massive short covering. Mgmt acting confident about recovery in housing market despite refusing to give forward fiscal year guidance
"More likely than not the infrastructure package is going to include funding for cheap housing, which will create even more business for home builders like LEN, DHI, TOL, TMHC, and the like. The housing shortage is a boon for home builders, retail supply, etc. Assuming interest rates don’t get wildly out of control these are industries I want to be in right now."
JMP raises target to 120!
This stock is setting up like a coiled spring. Looking for a 10% pop this month into & out of tremendous earnings release. All outside indications have remained supportive throughout.

"Gotta love LEN right here. Up 45% so far this year, and this headline from today's WSJ:""Home Builders Are Restricting Sales, Pushing Up New Home PricesMany cannot increase construction quickly enough to meet booming demand and are turning away business"""
Its market cap is almost the annual revenue. LOL so undervalued.
People who are selling right now don't know what they are doing...this company is very undervalued. Be patient and we will get rewarded...
11AM est conference call.....expecting big spike!!
"The homebuilders will rebound. Those who say it's over for them are clueless. We are barely getting started fixing the housing shortage. This is a general market selloff...inflation fears, not actual inflation. I'm buying the homebuilders on the dip and you should too. We have a ways to go yet before it's time to stick a fork in it."
What is the average hike/dip on quarterly earnings?
There's going to be a lot of analyst price target increase in the next 48 houts.
This company deserves to be at 120$.
With supply chain shortages and labor shortages many houses are just sitting unfinished. Interesting to think what lies ahead.
"I’ve been in new home construction for over 20 years, currently work for a top 5 builder, I can share that housing isn’t going to crash, far from it, but all us builders are going to come up way short on closings, margins are continuing to shrink, and although sales are still strong, a volatile economy could stall sales, and cancellation rates will start to tick up. I don’t think lennar will fall much today after earnings but I think these aforementioned points will send it down 4-5%."

They want to be led to a stock and be told by some slimeball on reddit to hold and not to worry about price, earnings or messy stuff like that. For me, I am going to continue being a dinosaur and invest in strong companies like Lennar. Not sexy but reliable."

In the Dallas market Lennar is sold out of homes and buildable lots until they catch up. This is a cash machine for at least the next year until production can catch up with demand.

Wonderful buy LEN DHI TOL especially NAIL today - Best To All!
Another example of the short term mentality on Wall Street. Homes have been badly under built in the US over the last 10 years. The fact that home builders can’t produce as many homes as demand dictates now is just adding to the problem and prolonging the boom in housing. This will stretch strong demand well out into the future. Margins are better than expected because prices are rising faster than costs. At some point the supply shortages and labor shortages start to abate. But the pent up demand this is causing will bode well for home builders. This is creating a floor under Lennar with a really high ceiling. The weakness and short sightedness now is an opportunity.
"Net earnings of $1.0 billion, or $3.20 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $398.5 million, or $1.27 per diluted share – both up over 150%--------------------------------------will shoot to 100 soon"

“Let your winners run!”
"In an attempt to view the glass as half full rather than half empty, here are some numbers on what one of our national builders went through starting with our Great Recession of 2008-09-10. Lennar stock price on 12-01-2008 was $6.57. Today stock price is $74 +. Dividend is $1.00 annual. Lennar was in very good financial condition (better than XIN) at the start of the 3 year real estate recession and, as a survivor, they picked up some great assets for about 20 cents on the dollar. They had tons of cash at the start and used it wisely. I bought from them in Naples, Florida in January 2010 and everything went well for both me and Lennar. For XIN shareholders this is all about survival and then about picking up some cheap pieces from the bankrupts."
I work with lennar builders and trust me it will play around 70 to 75 this week but the earnings coming up will build momentum and also the earnings will make it jump over 80.
PE will drop below 10 with this news. Looks Really good forward. 90 per share would be In line with industry
BUY THE DIP. 
"LEN is down today, selling off before earnings release. The only thing I don't like about that, is the fact I got in yesterday at a higher level, so the stock needs to regain that price point to put me in the Green tomorrow. Still very confident of a very good Earnings Report, and the stock should pop up in response. My next play after LEN will be SMPL to the Long side. I am slightly less enthusiastic about this one, but only because of her valuation. The single factor that tipped the scale enough to get me to commit to the play, is that SMPL raised Guidance after her last ER, which was, admittedly, not very good. I see a company choosing to proactively raise Guidance between Earnings Releases, as a strongly bullish sign. Analyze the action: The are setting a HIGHER bar for themselves, as a company. They are CHOOSING to raise expectations of traders and investors. They KNOW, before doing this, that their stock will be HURT on their next ER, if they miss badly on EPS or Revenue, right? Right! So, why CHOOSE to raise guidance mid-stream, unless you are genuinely confident of the numbers you are offering? Sure, they can expect a price pop on the guidance raise, but if they fail to deliver, the price will sink down even worse, in just a few weeks, upon delivering failed numbers in the actual ER. It just doesn't make logical sense for a company to raise Guidance between ER's, unless they are confident of their numbers. I think SMPL will beat on both EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, and move higher after Thursday morning's earning's report."
"Spectacular quarter. Provided rates don't get in the way I am bullish on the homebuilders as well as companies that do home improvement projects like LOW, SHW, and HD. The housing market has never been stronger."
Everyone in real estate knows that the minute interest rates rise a little is when the most building contracts get signed. It actually motivates folks to stop procrastinating. You'll see a mad increase in activity.
Buy NAIL to get back your loss 3 times faster on LEN DHI TOL...

What’s wrong with Lennar?
"You gotta shake your head when just about every other homebuilder stock is up due to Lennar's crushing it, Lennar right now is down, and Lennar is cheaper than most on a relative value. Unreal."
"First American's Chief Economist Odeta Kushi says housing-demand dynamics offset the negative impact of the country's limited supply of for-sale homes.""Millions more millennials will age into their prime home-buying age in 2021, and they will do so at a time of historically low mortgage rates,” said Kushi. “Working against them is the extremely limited supply of existing homes available for sale, especially homes priced for first-time homebuyers. In January, the positives of market demand overcame the negatives of supply, fueling a boost of approximately 512,000 potential home sales relative to one year ago.""The lack of existing homes available for sale reportedly remains the only drag on housing market potential. There is a fear among homeowners that, despite wanting to upgrade, they won't be able to find a new home in this tight market. New construction will help, but ""much more is needed."""
"""We continued to experience slower sales due to higher home prices and rising mortgage rates,"" Lennar's executives said"
"Excellent! LEN moves to the next stage of corporate life:""Lennar Corp. LEN, +0.17% said late Thursday that its board more than tripled the homebuilder's dividend as part of its program to increase returns to shareholders. Lennar will pay a quarertly dividend of 12.5 cents a share on Feb. 7, up from its previous dividend of 4 cents a share, to shareholders as of Jan. 24. ""Given our focus on operational excellence, land strategy and cash flow, we believe a diversified program of debt reduction, stock repurchase and now an increased dividend, is appropriate,"" said Stuart Miller, Lennar chairman."""
Strong fundamentals and strong earnings in a great sector.. This company is going places..
"50% haircut, see you at $45 end of year.Word.Dog."
"Took my buyers to Toll, Pulte and Century homes since they pay commissions to realtors. They agree to NOT deal with Lennar since they're cheap and CS is horrible. Rest my case."
"The economy is growing in many places across the US -- FL, WA, GA, SC, NC, TN, KY, TX, AZ, ID -- but declining in others -- CA, CT, NY, NJ, MD, MA, IL, RI. I don't believe LEN is taking advantage of this shift going forward into 2020 and beyond in this next cycle."
"KBH and LEN both miss on ER, but “near term outlook is positive” lol!"
"Solid housing market, pricing leverage, low interest rates, delayed purchases by millennials, and desire for suburban life again. All positives for LEN."

"Long 1400 shares of LEN at $58.07. This is a Pure Earnings play. I will be holding this Baby through her Wednesday Earnings Report.

But of course, as always, I could be totally wrong, so don't do as I do, do as your own highly intelligent brain deems best and appropriate. :-)"
Bad earnings?
LEN NAIL TOL DHI correction is OVER!
"Let me get this straight. No inventory to sell, mass delays in closings, delays in appliances, plumbing copper and electrical wiring. And you think the revenues will be up ? Well, raise the prices higher to make up for the loss of closings and cut all commissions to realtors."
