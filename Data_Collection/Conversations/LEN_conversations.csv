"Anyone see the Toll Brothers numbers today? Yow! I understand that Toll's average selling price is higher, but that was quite impressive. LEN pushed closer to a new all-time."

"Wells Fargo on homebuilders: "".. we have just laid the foundation for this cycle. Per our analysis, there is a long tail ahead, with demand support for 2.3M housing SAAR through the rest of the decade, while supply side consensus is much below at 1.5M"""
This stock is setting up like a coiled spring. Looking for a 10% pop this month into & out of tremendous earnings release. All outside indications have remained supportive throughout.
"There are too many doubters here, very hard to go up...Still too undervalued..."
"In an attempt to view the glass as half full rather than half empty, here are some numbers on what one of our national builders went through starting with our Great Recession of 2008-09-10. Lennar stock price on 12-01-2008 was $6.57. Today stock price is $74 +. Dividend is $1.00 annual. Lennar was in very good financial condition (better than XIN) at the start of the 3 year real estate recession and, as a survivor, they picked up some great assets for about 20 cents on the dollar. They had tons of cash at the start and used it wisely. I bought from them in Naples, Florida in January 2010 and everything went well for both me and Lennar. For XIN shareholders this is all about survival and then about picking up some cheap pieces from the bankrupts."
"Mr market again is making a mistake right now, an intelligent investor knows it is a great time to take advantage of him..."
Another example of the short term mentality on Wall Street. Homes have been badly under built in the US over the last 10 years. The fact that home builders can’t produce as many homes as demand dictates now is just adding to the problem and prolonging the boom in housing. This will stretch strong demand well out into the future. Margins are better than expected because prices are rising faster than costs. At some point the supply shortages and labor shortages start to abate. But the pent up demand this is causing will bode well for home builders. This is creating a floor under Lennar with a really high ceiling. The weakness and short sightedness now is an opportunity.
"Wait for $80- no materials, most homes in the wealthy Central Texas are 4 months behind on closings!!"
"Took my buyers to Toll, Pulte and Century homes since they pay commissions to realtors. They agree to NOT deal with Lennar since they're cheap and CS is horrible. Rest my case."
"It appears that LEN is over its short tantrum given Street comments about housing numbers slowing down, but now we might be ready to roll to new all-time highs."
"Net earnings of $1.0 billion, or $3.20 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $398.5 million, or $1.27 per diluted share – both up over 150%--------------------------------------will shoot to 100 soon"

"Mr market is wrong again this time, this company should not be traded at this cheap price. Do not sell or buy more if you can, this company worths at least 120...."
What pulled the rug out today??? I don't see any news about LEN for today!!
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Multistockalerts.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
With supply chain shortages and labor shortages many houses are just sitting unfinished. Interesting to think what lies ahead.
"LEN is my choice for next Pure Earnings play. I plan to liquidate CMC late Monday or Tuesday, hopefully after an excellent pop to the upside on a very good Earnings Report, and immediately buy a lot of LEN shares, to hold through her Wednesday PM release. My analysis of this stock indicates a very good chance of a very good Earnings Report, beats on EPS and Revenue Consensus Estimates, along with good Guidance. If that happens, I expect a very positive reaction in the stock price, a pop to the upside of at least 5% and possibly even 8-10%. I LOVE the valuation of LEN right now. It is cheap at this price. I like the sector a lot. This company is very well established, it is managed well. The stock price, right now, is poised to move up on good news, and I think that good news will come on Wednesday before the market opens. I want to be in, I think the risk/reward ratio is excellent on this one. But of course I could be totally and completely wrong, so do your own research and analysis, and Best of Luck to All! :-)"
Guidance revised down. Bad ER
Does anyone have insight what construction materials are in short supply for Lennar?
Delivery guidance missed. You guys are going to get killed tomorrow
"I’ve been in new home construction for over 20 years, currently work for a top 5 builder, I can share that housing isn’t going to crash, far from it, but all us builders are going to come up way short on closings, margins are continuing to shrink, and although sales are still strong, a volatile economy could stall sales, and cancellation rates will start to tick up. I don’t think lennar will fall much today after earnings but I think these aforementioned points will send it down 4-5%."
Knew this would happen. Sales people in Vegas said they can't finish homes due to supply demand. 9 months to build a home ??? I'll take my clients to buy a 2-3 year old resale and get a bigger lot size and $60k cheaper !
"SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom today signed bipartisan legislation to expand housing production in California, streamline housing permitting, and increase density to create more inclusive and vibrant neighborhoods across the state. The suite of bills also will help address the interrelated problems of climate change and housing affordability by promoting denser housing closer to major employment hubs – a critical element in limiting California’s greenhouse gas emissions. The Governor also highlighted the state’s ongoing work to spur more housing production, tackle barriers to construction and hold local governments accountable. * Yess, Lennar builds homes in California..lots"
"Another great quarter incoming, price of lumber peaked in between quarters, the fall and stabilization of lumber is great news for LEN. Margins continue to see a bounceback and sales are very strong. A volatile economy is going to allow buyers to take money from their holdings and use it to purchase bigger better homes. I think lennar will rebound today and I think these aforementioned points will send it up 5-7% after earnings."
So the company prioritized profits over revenue. Not sure how that is a problem. Better gross and net margins are always a positive sign. No wonder the company did a stock buyback. This company is focused on delivering shareholder value. I bought more today. Not selling at these levels.
"Apparently the market is making a huge mistake, this is too undervalued, buy as more as you can..."
Bad earnings?
NAIL is 3x of homebuilders' stock so NAIL will move up faster then LEN NVR DHI TOL SHW....when these stocks are up!
"With this price, I really hope I have enough capital to take lennar private..."
"Anyone know the analyst recommendation (buy, sell, hold etc), when it was made and the analyst name for LEN? Would appreciate if you can share the details. "
CNBC housing report is a JOKE they blame interest rates for slow down at 3% or 4%=cheap builders have a large backlog not accepting new contracts lack of sites and increase in materials.
"LEN is down today, selling off before earnings release. The only thing I don't like about that, is the fact I got in yesterday at a higher level, so the stock needs to regain that price point to put me in the Green tomorrow. Still very confident of a very good Earnings Report, and the stock should pop up in response. My next play after LEN will be SMPL to the Long side. I am slightly less enthusiastic about this one, but only because of her valuation. The single factor that tipped the scale enough to get me to commit to the play, is that SMPL raised Guidance after her last ER, which was, admittedly, not very good. I see a company choosing to proactively raise Guidance between Earnings Releases, as a strongly bullish sign. Analyze the action: The are setting a HIGHER bar for themselves, as a company. They are CHOOSING to raise expectations of traders and investors. They KNOW, before doing this, that their stock will be HURT on their next ER, if they miss badly on EPS or Revenue, right? Right! So, why CHOOSE to raise guidance mid-stream, unless you are genuinely confident of the numbers you are offering? Sure, they can expect a price pop on the guidance raise, but if they fail to deliver, the price will sink down even worse, in just a few weeks, upon delivering failed numbers in the actual ER. It just doesn't make logical sense for a company to raise Guidance between ER's, unless they are confident of their numbers. I think SMPL will beat on both EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, and move higher after Thursday morning's earning's report."
"Solid results. Congratulations to the Lennar. team.I’d be concerned if there was a slowdown in demand. If others want to sell off, that’s their prerogative. At this significant discounted price (in my opinion), I’m planning to buy more.I recommend that you do your own calculations, but per my workings, the trailing twelve month EPS now stands at $13.19. At today’s closing price of $98.30, the P/E now stands at approx 7.45. In my opinion, this valuation is unbelievably low and needs to be at least between 8.5 and 10, thus having a price between 112.11 and 131.9.Here’s my understanding:- Eye popping EPS OF $4.52 - Growth in Revenue - Increase in Orders for 4Q - Increase in Gross Margin, highest in the company’s history- increase in Net Margin, highest in the company’s history - Increase in selling price - Revenue per sq ft is up - Expense per sq ft is down - Increase in Deliveries of homes despite supply chain constraints - Other operating earnings $492 Million - Homebuilding cash $2.6 Billion - Early retirement of debt - Stock repurchase - Received upgrade from S&P - Executive Chairman expects to end 2021 on a very strong note - Underdelivered by 600 homes  (However, this is not due to a demand shortage, rather, because of supply chain constraints, which the entire industry is facing. As mentioned previously, I’d be concerned if there was a demand shortage.)"
"I don’t make the rules, but I believe that the current mechanism for valuing home builder stocks is outdated. LEN stock may have performed so much better if it belonged to any other industry group. Anyhow, it is what it is. I’m out of this stock after several months. Might revisit it in the future."

"Can't close on homes. 8-9 months to build. Ouch !! Lack of materials, shortage of appliances. The dump is coming !"
Earning on 9/20 should be perfect since even TOL posted a profit recently!LEN will make NAIL up 3X next week.
