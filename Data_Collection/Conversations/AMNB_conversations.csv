"bayman...there are some messages for you down lower on this page...I posted another message to you, but for some reason it was deleted (???)...I guess we have to be careful about what words we use...! That said, you can go to search and ask questions and search will tell us how to do things on a P.C. (if the website is working)...! Stagg...!"

"I mentioned this on the SFL board but have no idea where it went. Can a board be started on Investors Village like this one? A message board about high yield stocks as well as SFL and general information. I went to the SFL board on IV, they welcome SFL posters, but I'm not sure they want the kind of board we had on Yaho."
"GRAIN PRICES...are about the only thing on the up-tick today...corn is up 16 cents a bu. and soybeans are up 21 cents a bu.,...this is good for GRU, DBA, CORN and SOYB...! That said, I don't think that this Mid-Summer Rally is over yet...! Stagg...!"

"NYMT...Board members, NYMT (yield about 15.3%) has been on a strong roll...NYMT is now up 26.9% YTD in Total Returns...on the 12 different technical indicators I use, it is rated a 48% buy (the current trend is rated a sell)...support is 6.17, pivot is 6.22 and resistance is 6.27...! NYMT is not one of my core holdings, but I am well please with it and will continue to hold (but not add any)...! Stagg...!"

"Stagg, I haven't seen any posts from you in the last several days. Are you working in the fields or off hunting and fishing? It's been a very good couples of weeks in the market. PSEC, NYMT, FRO, ARCC, CPLP and SFL keep on paying and increasing their share price. With all the dividends added into my portfolio, I'm now up over 37 % YTD. It's been a nice summer rally. Glad I didn't sell and go away in May. I'm currently building up my cash fund so I'll be able to take advantage of ""bloody October.""Bayman"

"I went long INTC--maybe it is short. layoffs are to me a sign of poor management.The sudden, massive layoff looks (at least to this outsider) as if management had been in denial or had failed to take the unpleasant steps it knew it needed to take.The company will survive, but this announcement is a sign that management is not as sharp as it should be.Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced plans Tuesday to cut its workforce by 12,000 people, 11% of its current headcount. Such a massive, top-down layoff by any corporation always makes me wonder what's wrong with the company. Certainly circumstances change and reductions in workforces are required. But why not a few hundred last week, another hundred next month, in a gradual process that has a similar result? Massive layoffs are to me a sign of poor management.The proximate cause of the layoffs, according to the CEO's employee memo, is the shift from personal computers to cloud and mobile devices. CEO Brian Krzanich said that he had been working on the transition for three years, so it was no surprise. The specific timing and magnitude of market shifts may have been different from internal projections, but the general trend has been well known for quite a while.Go back three years and ask why Krzanich was keeping all of those 12,000 people on the payroll. Or go back three months and ask the same question. The boss might well have said something like, ""We've been ramping down our headcount; now we'll move faster because markets changed more rapidly than we had expected."" But that's not what happened. The sudden, massive layoff looks (at least to this outsider) as if management had been in denial or had failed to take the unpleasant steps it knew it needed to take.(Intel did lay off some workers last year, in what the local newspaper called ""semi-secret layoffs."")Intel is certainly not the only example of massive layoffs. Four years ago I wrote ""HP Layoffs a Sign of Bad Management"" quoting my old book Businomics:The massive staff reduction re"
