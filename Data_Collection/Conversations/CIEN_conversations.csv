"Piper Jaffray Upgrades CIEN to Overweight from Neutral, price target $50 up from $46.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen upgraded Ciena to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $50, up from 46. Ciena reported another strong quarter with October beating sales consensus estimates. North America continues to drive the upside with 5 consecutive quarters of over 20% year-over-year growth, the analyst points out. He continues to believe Ciena has a ""strong first mover status"" in 800G platform and views the company as one of the best ways to play the accelerating service provider spending to support 5G wireless networks."
stable as the day is long
Remember back inn the day when CIEN rallied because it only LOST $.10/share?
The investment community was whelmed by the quarterly report. Personally I thought it sounded pretty good.
"I am excited to hear that CIEN goes after disaggregated router, that is emerging. DANOS-Vyatta is in production at AT&T. CIEN's strength in optics differentiates itself in this game. Transport network at layer 1 is never virtualized. CIEN reported TAM expansion from $13B to $22B."
What’s with this weird unwarranted weakness?
"Argus reiterates Buy, raises price target to $53. 3/5/2019:* Strong beat and guide, raising target to $53.* Ciena dipped 2% after initially rallying following a stronger than expected fiscal 1Q19 and a positive outlook for F2Q19. Investors were concerned about gross margins, although high hardware mix is a long term positive.* Management reiterated its forecast for at leastr 20% non-GAAP EPS growth over the next three years, which is faster than the historical trend and the outlook for peers.* Ciena appears to be taking market share in a profitable way and is not experiencing meaningful pricing erosion. The company continues to diversify its customer base and reduce reliance on traditional telco customers.* The volatile CIEN shares have outperformed peers but continue to represent good value, given the accelerating EPS and cash flow growth outlook.More gains to come imo......."
"Lol! In the last five years cien has appreciated about 170%… not bad until you realize just buying a nasdaq etf woulda gotten you 190% return and in addition youda received 1.5% dividends each year! Lol, why make more money when you can get less?!"
800gb. not fully appreciate yet or reflected in the share price.
"Sold all my CIEN holdings .... not looking good. Too many supply constraints, worker defections ..... not looking good for next quarter."
Even for 5 years go figure..lots of fiber in ground not paying off in revs
Crushed earnings. A decent guide on the call and we make new highs.
"Yesterday JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target for Ciena to $53 from $50 saying he sees further upside in the shares. The analyst sees ~$2B of incremental revenue opportunity for the company through continued consolidation of share away from sub-scale optical system companies, a $2.4B opportunity through accelerated share wins from entrenched players, and ""strong"" growth opportunities in the Metro segment, which he believes is levered to benefit the most from 5G investments. Further, investor sentiment on Ciena shares stands to ""improve materially"" as competitive concerns relating to Acacia Communications' product look overdone. Chatterjee keeps an Overweight rating on the shares."
Do not understand the recent price drop following earnings.
"BofA analyst Tal Liani upgraded Ciena from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $65, up from $49. The analyst is citing the ""longer term opportunity"" beyond the ""weak"" first half particularly as spending by North American Tier 1 Service Providers bounce back in the second half of this year and into F2022 following a 15% decline in 2020. Liani further points to a ""robust"" global bandwidth demand, Ciena's share gain opportunities EMEA IP access networks, a ""significant"" internet build out in India, aggressive Huawei displacement, and 800G leadership."
Looks like the 7% gain just now got walloped.
"Ciena's Story Is Steadily Improving, But The Stock Hasn't Been So SteadySep. 10, 2019 8:00 AM ET |About: Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Includes: ACIA, CSCO, INFN, IPHI, NOK Stephen Simpson, CFA Long only, growth at reasonable price, value, research analystKratisto Investing(10,445 followers) SummaryCiena once again beat sell-side expectations, but the lack of a boost to guidance seems to have disappointed investors.The datacenter business continues to grow nicely, and Ciena is starting to see orders for its 800G technology.Ciena is now trading below the low end of my valuation range and looks like an interesting growth story to consider today.I’ve written more than once that Ciena (CIEN) shares often give investors “second chances” and that there are fairly frequent gaps between the company’s performance and near-term sentiment. And here we are again – while the company beat expectations in the fiscal third quarter and continues to gain share, the combination of concerns about global spending and management’s “failure” to raise guidance has the shares down about 13% relative to my last update.I’ve written before that I like the idea of buying Ciena shares below $40, and as of this writing, that’s where we are, so this is a name that is very high on my prospective buy list. Yes, I am concerned about the potential of slower datacenter spending, as well as lumpiness in service provider deployments, but I’m willing to accept that risk given the share gain, market growth, and margin improvement offsets. Ciena certainly wouldn’t be immune to a broader market sell-off (particularly a tech-led sell-off), but again that’s a risk that I’m willing to accept on balance.Another Beat… But No RaiseCiena has been enjoying a very good run of better-than-expected quarters, and the third quarter was no exception. Revenue was about 3% better than expected, and arguably even more important were the 200bp-plus beats at the gross and operating margin lines, as operating margin expansion/leverage has been one of the key bull/bear debates.Revenue rose 17% this quarter, with roughly similar growth across the major business units. Networking was the leader relative to expectations, though, with nearly 18% growth driving a number 6% higher than expected on 22% growth in converged packet. Software rose 16%, with nearly 140% growth in Blue Planet, but platform growth was just 1% and overall sales were a little shy of expectations again. Service revenue rose almost 17%, with 8% growth in maintenance-related revenue.Gross margin improved 430bp in the quarter, well above expectations, and operating income rose 36%, leading to 220bp of margin expansion. Gross margin is tough to model for Ciena on a quarter to quarter basis, as order timing and the make-up of orders can have a big impact; initial hardware installations tend to be lower margin (as do datacenter orders), but subsequent orders typically offer much higher margins.All told, telco service provider revenue rose 13%, which I regard as a strong result on balance (and relative to underlying trends at Nokia (NOK), Infinera (INFN), et al). Webscale was even stronger, with Ciena seeing almost 50% revenue growth, and for the first time ever, Ciena’s largest customer in the quarter was not a telco service provider (most likely Google, Facebook (FB), or Amazon (AMZN) ).The big negative from the quarter was that management didn’t raise guidance despite the beat, effectively leading to a negative revision for the fiscal fourth quarter. While the book to bill was below 1.0 this quarter, I don’t believe there is anything fundamentally wrong with the business – Ciena has established a track record of relatively conservative guidance, and that seems particularly prudent with the global economic slowdown likely leading at least some customers to reexamine their spending/deployment plans.Ongoing Opportunities For UpsideTrees don’t grow to the sky, but I still see several areas where Ciena can improve and continue to drive attractive growth in the business.In the datacenter, Ciena continues to add customers, with eight WaveServer wins in the third quarter and 16 wins for WaveLogic. The company also booked its first 800G WaveLogic order, suggesting the company is more or less on track with its deployment timeline. I’d also note that the strong growth in the Webscale (datacenter) business supports the position that Acacia’s (ACIA) 600G solution hasn’t been meaningfully disruptive to Ciena’s business or the market as a whole.Looking beyond the next few quarters, I still see some meaningful growth drivers for Ciena. Roughly 20% of the global metro market is comprised of “other” in the latest Dell’Oro report, and I think the market is going to become increasingly inhospitable to subscale players – customers won’t want to trust critical system deployments to providers where there are concerns about staying power, and those small companies aren’t going to have the revenue coming in to"
"Sep. 02, 2021 9:48 AM ETCiena Corporation (CIEN)By: Jason Aycock, SA News EditorUnfortunately we have been too optimistic because the negative results even if they have been already expected caused that reaction Of course it is possible also that the shorters have been compelled to require the coverage to the banks but I think that That is not the only reasonProbably the stock could go still down .....even if it can happena different scenario• Revenues rose barely, up 1.2% to $988.1 million, after gains in global services and platform made up for declines in core networking - but that topped high-end analyst estimates.• But adjusted operating expenses rose by nearly 16%, to $290.4 million. Adjusted operating margin fell to 19% from a previous 22.4%.• Adjusted net income fell to $144.9 million from a year-ago $166.4 million.• Revenue by segment: Converged packet optical, $712.9 million (down 1.3%); Routing and switching, $69.7 million (down 12.7%); Platform software and services, $56.9 million (up 22.6%); Blue Planet automation software and services, $16.6 million (up 46.9%); Global services, $132 million (up 13.1%).• Cash flow from operations reached $69.1 million, and cash and investments came to $1.5 billion at quarter's end. Average days' sales outstanding came to 89"
"Argus reiterates Buy, $66 price target. 12/10/20* Business activity strong, but deployments lag.* Ciena is experiencing a bifurcated business environment, in which customers are focused on edge networks while deferring investments on core and metro networks.* In a challenging time, Ciena has focused on generating strong free cash flows, which are benefiting from rising margins with more software in the mix.* The volatile CIEN shares trade at sharp discounts to peers and historical comparables. We believe they offer value, and look particularly compelling based on discounted free cash flow valuation."
