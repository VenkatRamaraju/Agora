"So perhaps the pandemic learned lessons will make the agencies more flexible especially in areas of unmet diseases.“The big takeaway for me, based on the past several months, is the importance of collaboration across the US government agencies and with international counterparts and the research community,” Cavazzoni said. “The other important takeaway is having a regulatory framework that allows us to be agile and flexible.”https://endpts.com/fda-center-directors-on-lessons-from-the-eua-pathway-flexibility-serves-us-well/Unfortunately the pandemic which now lasted more than anticipated also has caused disruptions for elective treatments so many cancer patients are not diagnosed in time and advance to more late stage cancers sad but true.“We conclude that compared to the pre-pandemic period, the COVID pandemic was associated with a 40.4% decrease in the number of colorectal cancers diagnosed in a year’s time,” Maria J. Domper Arnal, of the Lozano Blesa University Hospital in Spain, said during a press conference. “Patients diagnosed of colorectal cancer during the pandemic period were older, had more frequent symptoms, an increased number of complications and a 20% more advanced stage of the disease.”https://www.healio.com/news/gastroenterology/20211004/colorectal-cancer-diagnoses-dropped-by-40-during-pandemicIt seems targeted drug delivery is getting more recognition and their role in treating various diseases among others cancer is getting the attention of the industry.“Peptides are gaining increasing interest as potential therapeutics, especially in clinical fields where classical small molecules have, to date, not been successful. Although they face challenges such as short half and shelf lives due to proteolytic cleavage and fast kidney clearance, they bear advantages over small molecule drugs as they are potentially less toxic and more selective. Additionally, due to their selective binding, peptides can be used as shuttle systems to target drugs to certain diseased sites, thereby reducing systemic side effects. This Special Issue aims at compiling new and exciting insights into the prosperous field of peptide-based drug and delivery systems, including synthesis and biomedical evaluation of both peptidic drugs and peptide–drug conjugates for targeted delivery. Researchers are welcome to contribute any work dedicated to the synthesis as well as biological and therapeutic evaluation of peptides and peptide–drug conjugates. The following topics and key words may serve as orientation:Therapeutic applications of peptides (antimicrobial peptides, cancer treatment, vaccination, but also new applications)…”https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules/special_issues/Peptide_Drug_Conjugates"

"As the drug pricing reform has been discussed in the congress lately the pharma companies have been lobbying against it with a seven figure recently launched campaign. The article below does good analysis’s of what has to be considered for a fairly priced newly approved drug considering among others the cost of development. This article has been referenced to by pharma companies justifying their pricing. The trend has been moving towards value based pricing however the high prices of newly launched drugs have prompted calls for ‘cost-plus’ pricing approaches considering R&D costs. The fast track and orphan drug designation has been linked to reduced cost due to shortened trial time and fewer trial participants. They also say the cost estimates of an R&D project from preclinical to the end of post approval based on multiple articles can vary from $161 million to $4.54 billion however they believe as there are many factors involved it is somehow hard to predict the cost as during the process the sponsor might have to change the trial design or/and will be granted various favorable designations from agencies.The point is as there is a never ending debate about the drug pricing however there are many factors which have to be considered so the R&D companies have financial incentives to start lengthy and somehow hard to estimate costly projects. As for THTX going forward depending on results getting orphan drug, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval will be effecting the costs of their program positively. Their PDC if it shows promising results will be qualifying for those beneficial designations.“This From a health economics perspective, and one that endorses fair access to innovative value-added products, we believe that high R&D costs alone should not justify high medicine prices. Indeed, there is a trend towards a ‘value-based pricing’ model where R&D costs alone do not necessarily play a crucial role. However, the inherent risks of pharmaceutical R&D cannot be ignored, and the value-based pricing model must contend with the ‘if’ and ‘how’ successful medicines compensate drug failures.Our assessment uses criteria addressing three key domains: (1) how the drugs’ success rates and development time used for cost estimation were obtained; (2) if the study considered potential sources attributing to the variation in R&D costs; and (3) what the components of the cost estimation were?Some experts have challenged the estimations presented in the articles used in our analysis, in respect of how four variables impact the validity of existing and future estimates. The role of public investment: How much of the R&D costs come from public resources and not from private investments? (2) Post-authorization R&D costs: After the drug is approved by the corresponding regulator (e.g., FDA or European Medicines Agency [EMA]), how much R&D is still required to assure reimbursement and market success? (3) Disparities in regulations and length of time for approval across time. (4) Variations in the complexity of clinical trials (e.g., protocol design) across time. Although these variables do not have a main role in estimating the R&D costs of bringing a new NME to the market, they still warrant consideration. The first (the role in public investment) is not related to the R&D cost level but with the funding sources. The second (post-authorization R&D costs) captures the authors’ consideration of potential R&D costs occurring after market approval, which are particularly relevant for drugs approved in the earlier stages of development. The latter two are crucial if the aim is to analyze possible future trends in R&D costs. We systematically reviewed studies that estimated the (prelaunch) R&D cost per NME and examined how the studies addressed key factors that might influence the estimate. The main components of the R&D cost per NME are: (1) direct cash expenses; (2) the future value at the time of launch (and thus return on investment), which is to be adjusted to the high risk of development failure (i.e., success or attrition rates); and (3) the long development times resulting in substantial opportunity costs (i.e., COC). Results showed a wide range of R&D cost estimates, from $161 million to $4.54 billionSeveral factors affect the investment in R&D, and we selected the five factors most often mentioned in the literature: therapeutic class; orphan or non-orphan drugs; firm size; NCE or new biological entity (NBE); and self-originated or licensed-in (acknowledging it is not meant to be an exhaustive list).Despite the increase in the number of new orphan drugs approved and launched into the market, the methodologies used to estimate R&D costs mostly ignored possible differences between orphan and non-orphan drugs. Some studies suggest that R&D costs for orphan drugs might be about half of those for non-orphan medicines. This is partly explained by the fact that trials related to rare diseases include fewer participa"

"Quick Summary Cantor:Paul mentioned their oncology platform “magic” has a very application, between now and the end of the year they will have the MTD and inform the market, they are currently dosing patients, they could potentially see early efficacy of a patient with high level of Sortilin. They are exploring a partnership for their oncology technology in China.On NASH they will definitely proceed with the program with or without a partner as they think they have strong data to “tip it over’ to an approval, he predicted an approval by 2026. They will eventually need to have a partner for the potential approved drug in order to commercialize it. He believes THTX is serious contender in the industry.On Egrifta he mentioned lipodystrophy is linked to NAFLD/MASH and as science has evolved physicians will understand the condition is not cosmetic therefore he projected “significant” sale growth for the drug.As for Trogarzo Paul mentioned the aging MDR patients after 40 years of ART will eventually develop resistance and the market is moving away from oral daily pills towards long acting drugs such as Trogarzo."
"The article sums up nicely the MOA of their PDC, looking through it I found a couple interesting things. So they are saying due to rapid, (less than 5 hours) cytotoxic effect of the drug supports significant ligand internalization also overexpression of Bcl-xL a transmembrane molecule in the mitochondria has been observed in various cancers these molecules’ presence have been linked to resistance to various taxanes such as docetaxel and down regulation of the protein showed an increased sensitivity to chemo agent, faster cell death by their PDC resulted in reduction of these proteins thus less chemoresistance. They also say the PDC both intravenous and within the peritoneal cavity (the area that contains the abdominal organs) are well tolerated.TH1902, a new docetaxel‐peptide conjugate for the treatment of sortilin‐positive triple‐negative breast cancer - Demeule - - Cancer Science - Wiley Online Library"
"just starting it's move up, over $4.25 this month, then I'll be back and give you shareholders next price,I'll steadily be buying in 501 share lots"
Also very nice cup handle forming on 1 and 5 year charts. A cup handle is one of the most bullish technical signals.
Why is this stock hyped up by so many private brokerages? It doesn’t make any $$. It’s not going anywhere. Why do you people kid yourselves
"It seems investors have putting their bets on big pharmaceutical companies and IPOs this year rather than small cap biotech. As per this article there is a large gap between big and small biotech companies which should based on past experiences close.Hopefully with potential good results from oncology trial, positive developments in THTX’s NASH protocol and closing valuation gaps we see a decent return on our investment soon in this ignored little company with great prospects. “The market-weighted Nasdaq Biotech Index is up 8.7% year to date due largely to Moderna, while the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, which tracks the equal-weighted S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index and is seen as more of a proxy for small caps, has declined 13% year-to-date. Still, overall gaps between small and large caps historically don’t last long. The recent underperformance comes amid heightened competition for investors’ dollars, according to Oppeinheimer analyst Hartaj Singh. Those who focus on biotechs have had a healthy crop of initial public offerings, splitting their attention with a slew of existing biotechs. July marked a record month for the number of these deals in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.JMP’s Butler said the successes of the large companies tend to signal that smaller ones are soon to follow suit. During downturns in 2015 and at the end of 2018, larger-cap biotechs led the recovery, followed closely by their smaller counterparts, he said. Corrections of this size are usually followed by recoveries, added Roderick Wong, chief investment officer of RTW Investments. “At a minimum we would expect the gap in performance to narrow between small-cap biotech and others.For Brakel, the potential for positive clinical trial results in the coming months coupled with the current low valuations creates a buying opportunity.”https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/small-cap-biotech-stocks-play-120000602.html"
The company is going to present at HC Wainwright on September 13 and they also have a KOL NASH event on the same day. Not sure why these PRs are not announced here!
Anyone thinks the company will be bought out?
"starting to move upward, Research Cap. knows it'll go higher or M&A deal much much higher $10"
"NASH KOL event:As per Paul the company has significant R&D opportunities.Dr. Harrison touched based on the prevalence of the condition, a quarter of population have fatty liver disease, 37% of middle age Americans have NAFLD based on none invasive diagnostics and 14% of those patients have NASH(after performing biopsies). A quarter of patients develop cirrhosis over their life time with a rate of 2, 5% decomposition of liver annually.As per the re generative nature of the liver when exposed to assault it tries to heal itself resulting in scar tissues caused by inflammation among others so best route to deal with condition is to remove the cause of it such as insulin resistance.He mentioned NASH has two components one ballooning (liver cell injuries) and the other one inflammation leading to fibrosis. He also mentioned safety issues was a hindrance for drugs to be approved, NASH is a heterogeneous condition so some drugs work for a group of patients and not for others. To tackle the problem he suggested a combo approach (different mechanism of actions) or utilizing mechanism that are higher up in the pathogenesis of disease like Tesamorelin(targeting pathways than are high up that can per inhibit multiple mechanism downhill thus broader efficacy) rather than being laser focused on certain mechanism. He also said mono therapy are not successful so far therefore they need combination therapy mixing injections and orals.Lobular inflammation and ballooning are associated with visceral fat also reducing visceral has a role in extra hepatic diseases like cardio vascular diseases.As for combo therapy he suggested thyroid hormone beta agonist(oral) which is well tolerated like Tesamorelin or other drugs like structurally engineered fatty acids as candidates however initially it’s wiser to try Tesamorelin in mono therapy and eventually as a backbone drug in a combo treatment. He believes it’s important to have well tolerable drugs as they will be used for a while for patients suffering from the condition.Dr. Grinspoon also reinstated Tesamorelin has multiple MOAs targeting the indications (Tesamorelin can be by itself a combo therapy). He referenced visceral fat as bad depot, Tesamorelin reduces that which has positive cardiovascular effects and subcutaneous fat is good fat depot, therefore BMI only should not be used as an indicator for the condition, he also mentioned Tesamorelin could be a backbone therapy for a combination therapy. He mentioned Tesamorelin approved since 2010 has a very good safety profile and did not alter glucose in diabetic patients (comorbidity associated with NAFLD/NASH) as per previous studies performed by THTX. The CMO elaborated on the slide with the phase 3 trial design which is rather large therefore it has two parts, Part 1 randomized 1 to 1(enough placebo patients to reduce the background noise when reading the biopsy results and 18 months thus better effect on fat reduction) and part 2 (post approval). Dr. Harrison commented on the design as a nice design with a drug which has great safety profile. Futility trial performed on more than half the patients in part one will be included to see if they should continue with the trial (de-risking the trial).Paul also mentioned 3 advantages for their program, safety of the drug, upstream MOA of the drug which has 18 months to work and the fact they learned from others failures before putting together a well-designed trial. They touch based on eventually moving to non-invasive diagnostic such as presence of bio markers (blood test) and imaging diagnostic They have a well powered study plus futility analysis as per Dr. Loomba and that is the strength of the program."
CEO is not delivering. He needs to step up to the plate.
Anyone with some intel here? This hasn’t been over $4 bucks in years
"upward volume started,now watch for insider buying"
"Oncology:They have a very exciting program, after studying the sortilin receptor which are progressively over expressed in late stage cancers they have designed a “fit for purpose “peptide which links to the receptor and can get the payload(cytotoxic agent) into cancer cells(rapid internalization), they have the technology using same peptide attached to different linkers and payloads(different designs). Their peptide mimic the ligand that the sortilin needs and it is internalize by the receptor mediated mechanism and the payload will be released into cancer cells (endocytosis). The design is unique as it can deliver the cytotoxic medicine in a very neat way. TH1902 shows faster apoptosis(cell death)at 5 hours and 24 hours’ time frame versus docetaxel alone and apoptotic induction(cell death) can be reversed by sort 1 ligand competitors ( by blocking the receptor) net result is cytotoxic medicine targeting the cancer cells while sparing the healthy cells. Also TH1902 at peak concentration resulted in a very little of docetaxel in blood stream this less toxicity. Paul mentioned they also have preclinical ongoing studies with their other peptide TH1904 and Doxorubicin (another anti-cancer medicine). They are going to challenge the therapeutic window of their PDC based on sparing the healthy cells and targeting the cancer cells. They have plans to attach different payloads to their peptides through different linkers in the future. They will be also exploring combination therapy coupling their PDC/PDCs with immunotherapies.NASH:Tesamorelin has unique mode of action as it will be stimulation endogenous release of GH and not GH thus no side effects associated to GH. In the phase 2 trial the drug achieved 37% relative liver fat reduction and as per recent findings in the event when hepatic fat is reduced by 30 per cent or more it will result in regression of fibrosis, in their study 60 percent of patients achieved over 30 percent liver fat reduction. The study showing the data above wasn’t a perfect study as it was done over 12 months, it takes longer for Tesamorelin to deploy full efficacy therefore they will be testing Tesamorelin during a period of 18 months and in this study they will be testing on “sweet spot” F2/F3 patients only, therefore they expect the numbers to be better. They have strong IP “SOLID GROUND” as they have two patents, one Tesamorelin reducing progressions of liver fibrosis (NAFLD/NASH) , another patent Tesamorelin for treatment of hepatic disease (NAFLD NASH) both up to year 2040, also the drug has strong safety profile. There are currently 6M patients with F2/F3 in the US only so there is a very sizable market for an approved drug.They are ABSOLUTLY committed to go forward with NASH, if they wanted to start they could now as they have a CRO that is in “starting block” but they decided to paus and seek a partner with interest, resources and capabilities failing that they will be looking at other means to fund the trial.Paul mentioned the post approval trial enrolling 1800 patients for five years will also be looking at cardio vascular benefits.Legacy drugs:$66M sales in the middle of pandemic, they see growth going forward as lipodystrophy is now more understood as a not cosmetic disease and they get new patients on Egrifta every month they will expect to generate significant sale growth in coming years as F8 will be superior to SV (much better patients’ experience). As for Trogarzo a lot of patients after 40 years need additional blockers to stop HIV virus effecting the cells and shutting down their immune system, Trogarzo has a place in the MDR market and the growth will be based on new patients in the States and Europe."

David from Nicholas investments on Charles Payne show likes this . bought 500 @ 3.93 . lets go !!!
I cannot believe someone is selling right now and dropping the share price like this. We will know efficacy results of oncology before year-end. NASH is still moving forward. Cash burn is lower than other drug companies since we have two commercial products. New innovations in the pipeline. Makes no sense to me.
just the beginning of good news today $10 before end of year
"Few interesting things from CC:Sales of Egrifta SV increased significantly but Trogarzo’s sales still is under pressure due to Pandemic and competition having said that they finalized their pricing negotiations in Italy and within next two weeks will be finalizing the pricing in France and are expected to launch the drug in both countries by end of 2021.They are on schedule with the dose escalation for their PDC they had no DLT so far, patients that received 300mg/m2 (1.5 times the indicated dose of Docetaxel) had no grade 2 adverse events, the last patient who received 420mg/m2 of TH1902 had grade 4 neutropenia which equals grade 2 adverse effect but they will moving on with dose escalation until the MTD is determined. They have received interest from Chinese companies for the oncology program so early in the process.The NASH program will be going ahead with or without partner in 2022 also as mentioned earlier they have hired a US biopharma advisory firm assisting the company to find a suitable partner.They have over $51M which should cover their operational expenses for another year."
"From the transcript.On collaborations(they touch base on that later during questions from analysts too):We are also looking at additional opportunities and regulatory commercial installed for TH1902 in other geographies. Currently, we are exploring potential cooperating and alliances with China based organization to evaluate TH1902 in patients in Greater China that are suffering from sortilin-expressing cancers.08:11 By gaining the support, and scientific expertise of the locally based organization to help us develop TH1902 we are better positioning ourselves to bring this potential treatment to patients faster and more effectively, which is at the foundation of our oncology strategy.The event provided a deep dive into our innovative approach to treating NASH [indiscernible] and also demonstrated the distinct support this program has from these leading disease and industry experts. We look forward to updating you on the advancement of our NASH program soon.On sales:Since then, we have challenged the fundamentals of our business, developing a mature business acumen, which includes a more focused field force. And digitalize training and product education tools and have ultimately created a solid go to market model.As a result, sales increased nearly thirty percent in the third quarter over twenty twenty one over last year supported by sixty five increase in EGRIFTA SV sales. The improvement in EGRIFTA SV sales is a direct result of a returning to some face-to-face meetings and greater and more efficient digital campaigning and [indiscernible] patient, which also led to a forty percent increase in new prescribers during the quarter.The mode of convenient IV Push mode administration [indiscernible] two good infusions from offering patients or rapid infusion time, thereby potentially increasing patient applicant, and allowing patients to benefit from long-acting protection against HIV-1 when Trogarzo is administered with other antiretrovirals.Specific to our progress in the Italian market, our technologies and Italian medicines agency recently reached a reimbursement agreement with Trogarzo, and we expect that this medicine will become commercially available to all eligible patients in Italy by the end of fiscal year twenty twenty one.On oncology and NASH:we are extremely pleased and encouraged by the early indication that the Phase 1 Part A study in TH1902 have demonstrated and look forward to both interim and full data results in this program over the next several quarters.Well as Paul mentioned on the NASH program, the outreach is continuing and we have had some discussions with potential partners, but there's no real update at this point. On the oncology, we've had some, we hired the advisors well for Greater China. We have received some inbound interest from Chinese companies and we decided to go out much broader than just dealing with one or two. And so, we've initiated a process, a formal process. There's quite a bit of interest in China for the oncology platform.Again, very early to report any anything substantial, but we’re frankly pretty encouraged with the interest that we've seen. On the in-licensing side, it's a little less active although we have been approached with some very interesting earlier stage projects. So, we're not quite ready to discuss that. But there is, you know, one of the plans that we have is to act as a catalyst for research that is being done here in Quebec in addition to in-licensing other technologies.Note they have so far dosed one patient at a time something I have tried to point out several times.we've been enrolling patients one by one. And as we move deeper in the Phase 1 we be rolling three by three and when the expansion trial comes in, it's forty patients so next year, there should be to ramp up on the oncology program.On dosing and MTD:Yes, absolutely, well, this is – we're not there yet with the MTD. The way it works as even like what we need, you see is what we call a dose [indiscernible] toxicity. And what we have seen so far is a neutropenia without fever, therefore it is not yet a DLT and once we reach and like a great to adverse events, we need to enroll more patient at that dose level. And once we have to treat a total of three patients treated at that dose level, we decide if we can continue to increase or if we remain at the same dose or if we have to lower the dose.35:29 Then what I can say about this Phase 1 trial at the moment, if this really what we have what we were expecting from the animal data that we had. And we are now at those levels that are in the range of about 2x docetaxel. We have dose patients at three hundred with that rate to adverse event, which means that we can administer up to one point five times the dose of docetaxel when conjugated with on TH1902, without having any adverse events.Then we're getting close to the MTD. That's the dose that we're expecting based on the animal model, we need two more patients to"
"They made more money than last quarter, and last quarter they met guidance, but this quarter they missed it by a lot. Was there an unexpected expense, or why was guidance so much higher?"
"Quick summery from the chat today:On NASH the CEO said they are in sweet spot as if their future potential partner believes the trail needs to be modified they still can do it, he also said he is open to various forms of partnership whether it would include an upfront payment ($50M upfront payment was mentioned), milestones and THTX will run the trial or other partnerships agreement with the potential partner with better expertise will run the trial with THTX. They have engaged a company called MTS their website below:https://www.mtspartners.com/investment-banking/overviewCEO said they always had the partnership for NASH as some stage in their plans due to need of a bigger sale force for a potential approved drug.On oncology CEO said they are dosing patients every week and although they are currently dosing all comers they collect data from patients which have been already dosed looking for the rate of Sortilin overexpression. They will be updating the market re the oncology phase1 part1 by end of this year, and phase1 part 2 will start early next year however that time line can change based on the results and more interactions with FDA. The CFO said they are targeting 5 to 6 cancers each with a market size of up to 10000 patients and as per pricing of the drug he referenced to Trodelvy (another ADC) costing $200 k per year. SO again they are talking about $12B revenues.On F8 they expect launch next September and Trogarzo IV push mid-year next year. CEO also said they will keep Trogarzo IV on the market.As per recent ATM the CFO said they don’t need the cash now but they want that instrument in place based on better than expected oncology results and possible expansion of the trial which requires more funds, he also mentioned they might not need it at all anytime soon as a potential NASH partnership could come with an upfront payment."
"This article published in August 2021 gives a good detailed overview of cell penetrating peptides and their advantages as a targeted delivery technology. They touch based on peptides lipophilicity (ability to dissolve in fat), solubility, and small molecular sizes etc. which contribute to internalization of them into cancer cells. Cancer can remodel the cell membrane resulting in less anticancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic agent however CPPs are positive charged are biodegradable and often possess low immunogenicity and low toxicity and favor the negatively charged tumor membranes over those of healthy cells which are electrically neutral. The targeted drug delivery technology can bypass the multi drug resistance due to better selectivity, better bioaccessibility ( the fraction of the total amount of a substance that is potentially available for absorption) to the tumor cells, enhanced permeability and retention and “utilization of a homing device such as an antibody or a targeting ligand that will enable to attach to tumor cells through antigens or receptors on their surface, usually overexpressed in certain tumor types” among others. The article goes on and discuss the pros and cons of covalently or noncovalently bounds with anticancer agents and additional beneficial feature of coupling a chemotherapeutic with a CPP.“The ability to permeabilize in the membrane and gain access to the cytosolic compartment is largely dependent on the physicochemical qualities of the therapeutic entities including the most relevant such as lipophilicity (ability to dissolve in fat…), polarity (positive and negative charges at the ends of the molecule) and molecular size. Among them, a fairly but not excessively hydrophobic (water insoluble) character is most conducive to the drug transport; very large, polar hydrophilic molecules are being poorly internalized similarly as extremely hydrophobic (the former ones will fail to enter the membrane, the latter will enter readily but may have difficulty in leaving it). At the cellular level, most anticancer drugs act on membrane surface receptors or have intracellular targets. In the latter case, a drug must cross the cellular membrane that constitutes an additional barrier for it. A further complication for drug traversing the cellular membranes is their remodeling induced by cancer itself, which brings about complex changes in the membrane structure and composition. They lead to a drop in anticancer drug efficacy manifested by simultaneous cancer cell proliferation, avoidance of apoptosis and development of cellular resistance.Generally, anticancer therapy bears a high incidence of toxicity due to a low therapeutic index of the drugs and the simultaneous necessity for the usage of high doses in order to produce the clinical effect. An explanation for these unfavorable parameters of the anticancer therapy is lack of drug selectivity (they damage not only cancerous cells but also healthy rapidly growing ones) and poor bioaccessibility to the tumor cells. Another shortcoming of this therapy is multidrug resistance (MDR), which constitutes one of the dominant reasons for its failure. An attractive application of the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect in tumor chemotherapy comprises therapeutics in the form of liposomes, polymers or micelles. This effect has also been utilized by experimental technologies based on cell-penetrating peptides coupled with diverse types of cargoes (low molecular weight anticancer drugs). CPPs are a class of diverse short sequence peptides (usually <30 amino acids) of natural (protein-derived or chimeric) or synthetic origin.Internalization mechanisms of CPPsAccording to the available data, CPPs are internalized by two possible main pathways, i.e. endocytosis (energy dependent) and/or direct translocation (energy independent).The role of CPPs in cancer treatment (CPPs as vectors for anticancer drug delivery).The interaction of a CPP with cancerous cells should be considered in light of the current concept of cancer-induced modifications within the cell membrane itself. They concern both its heteropolysaccharide (They are compounds that are made up of two or more different types of monomer. Made up of the same repeating unit. As a rule, they are overexpressed in cancerous membranes) and lipid components (Also, the lipid component contributes to the anionic character of the cancerous membrane due to the exposition of the negatively charged phosphatidylserine in its outer leaflet which correlates with a more acidic pH of their external media as well), ensuring the uncontrolled growth, progression and invasiveness of the tumor cells.Generally, the CPPs possessing mostly cationic nature due to arginine and lysine residues favor the negatively charged tumor membranes over those of healthy cells, which are electrically neutral.Improvement of anticancer selectivity of CPPs"

Trying to load up with as much as I can before a big announcement ! It’s coming
"My take is absent any speculations when one run a business regardless whether the business is selling the value of its tangible/ intangible assets it has to make sure all of it is understood and valued by the buyers. The golden rule in investing is diversification that rule does also apply to businesses offering various goods, services and ideas, point is the business has to make sure all their operations with potentials of bringing in revenues are run efficiently some less lucrative but more reliable and vice versa. For instance back in the day when I was practicing I had a less lucrative contract with NHS taking care of X amount of patients for a set fee which was ongoing and reliable. At times due to lack of time taking care of much more lucrative private patients it didn’t seemed feasible to keep that contract going but the private segment was not reliable so for instance during subprime crisis that sector got hit and the NHS contract came very handy, what I am trying to say is a contingency plan should be part of the overall plan in the business.THTX has two main assets the commercial part and the R&D part. The commercial part is the reliable but potentially less lucrative part if and when the R&D programs are successful they will be the main breadwinners but they are not there yet, now why early in the process would/should they give up on that part? On the contrary that is the part they have most control of also due to better marketing and the launch of better administration methods of the drugs (Trogarzo IV push/IM and F8) they can bring in increasing revenues regardless of what other operations they are involved in or how successful those operation are. Those revenues can partially fund the R&D programs also as there are some incomings future fund rising will be needed later and will be lesser.As per oncology it has great prospects and some 5 months into process it seems it is progressing well but it is far early to light the Cohiba cigar therefore the company cannot and should not make any strategic decisions based on that asset. NASH programs have not being successful after more than a decade of research so far and recently due to NGM’s phase 2b Alpine study’s failure the space is now out of favor among investors, but that doesn’t change the fact the condition is still unmet, epidemic with great financial prospects for more than one approved drug. As a reminder their science is based on Tesamorelin’s targeted proteomic, transcriptomic approach, organic approach which works upstream by stimulating the pituitary glands to produce normal timed secretion of growth hormone which directly reduces visceral fat, decreases lipogenesis, decreases triglyceride accumulation, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation, improves mitochondrial function and indirectly GH stimulates endogenous production of IGF-1 in the liver resulting in decreases insulin resistance, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation, deactivates hepatic stellate cells (liver cells that contribute to fibrosis) , also no overstimulation of GH like thyroid approach and list goes on.. “The totality of data”. So although they don’t have many F2/F3 biopsy confirmed patients their innovative and different approach could be the potential cure for this condition which has caused great humanitarian and economic burden globally. Point is in my opinion they should work hard to increase the sales (reliable, relatively controllable even so less lucrative compared to original estimates), make sure the oncology trial is running smoothly and at its best potentials(pushing CROs to have patients enrolled in time, on the back of potential good results expand it as planned to more cancers and approach EMA for an IND for the protocol etc.), last but not least bring their NASH program to spotlights so both investors and potential partners understand the embodied value of it, based on the outcome of their efforts make the right strategic decision related to NASH, if they get some bites then bring that partner onboard which can either fund the trial or/and add expertise(that also add credibility to the program and the whole company, de-risk the program but they will have to give up some part of the potential future revenues if and when the drug gets approved), run the futility trial alone then bring the partner onboard or move on from there by themselves etc., dropping it outright isn’t it in my opinion. I just want to also touch base on the economics of trials as per some they cost $100M, $150M and I am not sure what those estimates are based on looking at available information on the net a trial based on the condition it is targeting and duration of it among others can cost anything between $30k to $60k per patient to put it in perspective the suggested futility trial enrolling 400 patients for the duration of 18 months could cost anything between $12M to $24M and the proposed phase3 trial with 1100 patients enrolled could cost some $33M to $66M also all"
Holding 120K shares @3.6 and just waiting patiently

I will keep adding shares on weekly basis. This is a 30.00$ stock. Company portfolio of therapeutics almost 25 years in the making with astronomical potential.
