"They made more money than last quarter, and last quarter they met guidance, but this quarter they missed it by a lot. Was there an unexpected expense, or why was guidance so much higher?"
Patience will pay with this one
"It was some speculation re moving to earlier stages of cancers possibly due high affinity rate to sortilin so despite lower expression of the receptor they could show both safety and efficacy, well it seems AZ has plans to do exactly that. I know it’s early in the process but when they are talking about expansion of the program we know already they might chasing 5 or 6 cancers what else could they have in their mind when they are talking about expansion?Also it seems AZ and Sankyo strike a deal ($6B) for another PHASE1 ADC chasing Trodelvy’smetastatic TNBC market.“Monday’s study, however, suggests that for this earlier line of treatment, the companies are planning to shoot straight for a full approval. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo enrolled about 500 patients in the trial and recruited patients on five continents.But the AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo partnership doesn’t stop there. The two are working on another ADC in datopotamab deruxtecan, agreeing to a deal worth up to $6 billion back in July 2020. For that program, the companies are chasing Gilead’s Trodelvy, which got FDA approval in April to treat metastatic TNBC patients in the second line or later as well as an accelerated nod in urothelial carcinoma the same month.”AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo continue to flesh out Enhertu plans, claiming win in earlier breast cancer line – Endpoints News“Financial considerationsAstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo an upfront payment of $1bn in staged payments: $350m is due upon completion, with $325m after 12 months and $325m after 24 months from the effective date of the agreement.AstraZeneca will pay additional conditional amounts of up to $1bn for the successful achievement of regulatory approvals and up to $4bn for sales-related milestones.”https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-and-daiichi-sankyo-enter-collaboration-to-develop-and-commercialise-new-antibody-drug-conjugate.htmlhttps://www.daiichisankyo.com/media/press_release/detail/index_3131.html"
"Terrible conference call with not a single question asked at the end. Was a single analyst even on the call? Pitiful! However, based on today's trading, you would think someone actually cares about the earnings and timing of revenues. Did we lose ground on the Ph.1? No. Did we lose ground on the Ph. 3? No. That's the upside at this point and while I didn't hear anything new on the call, rather a rehash of what has already been released, those opportunities feel free based on the current stock price. When will we get some excitement from shareholders buying into this massive opportunity?"

TH.TO is down 7.50% to $8.14
"Oncology:They have a very exciting program, after studying the sortilin receptor which are progressively over expressed in late stage cancers they have designed a “fit for purpose “peptide which links to the receptor and can get the payload(cytotoxic agent) into cancer cells(rapid internalization), they have the technology using same peptide attached to different linkers and payloads(different designs). Their peptide mimic the ligand that the sortilin needs and it is internalize by the receptor mediated mechanism and the payload will be released into cancer cells (endocytosis). The design is unique as it can deliver the cytotoxic medicine in a very neat way. TH1902 shows faster apoptosis(cell death)at 5 hours and 24 hours’ time frame versus docetaxel alone and apoptotic induction(cell death) can be reversed by sort 1 ligand competitors ( by blocking the receptor) net result is cytotoxic medicine targeting the cancer cells while sparing the healthy cells. Also TH1902 at peak concentration resulted in a very little of docetaxel in blood stream this less toxicity. Paul mentioned they also have preclinical ongoing studies with their other peptide TH1904 and Doxorubicin (another anti-cancer medicine). They are going to challenge the therapeutic window of their PDC based on sparing the healthy cells and targeting the cancer cells. They have plans to attach different payloads to their peptides through different linkers in the future. They will be also exploring combination therapy coupling their PDC/PDCs with immunotherapies.NASH:Tesamorelin has unique mode of action as it will be stimulation endogenous release of GH and not GH thus no side effects associated to GH. In the phase 2 trial the drug achieved 37% relative liver fat reduction and as per recent findings in the event when hepatic fat is reduced by 30 per cent or more it will result in regression of fibrosis, in their study 60 percent of patients achieved over 30 percent liver fat reduction. The study showing the data above wasn’t a perfect study as it was done over 12 months, it takes longer for Tesamorelin to deploy full efficacy therefore they will be testing Tesamorelin during a period of 18 months and in this study they will be testing on “sweet spot” F2/F3 patients only, therefore they expect the numbers to be better. They have strong IP “SOLID GROUND” as they have two patents, one Tesamorelin reducing progressions of liver fibrosis (NAFLD/NASH) , another patent Tesamorelin for treatment of hepatic disease (NAFLD NASH) both up to year 2040, also the drug has strong safety profile. There are currently 6M patients with F2/F3 in the US only so there is a very sizable market for an approved drug.They are ABSOLUTLY committed to go forward with NASH, if they wanted to start they could now as they have a CRO that is in “starting block” but they decided to paus and seek a partner with interest, resources and capabilities failing that they will be looking at other means to fund the trial.Paul mentioned the post approval trial enrolling 1800 patients for five years will also be looking at cardio vascular benefits.Legacy drugs:$66M sales in the middle of pandemic, they see growth going forward as lipodystrophy is now more understood as a not cosmetic disease and they get new patients on Egrifta every month they will expect to generate significant sale growth in coming years as F8 will be superior to SV (much better patients’ experience). As for Trogarzo a lot of patients after 40 years need additional blockers to stop HIV virus effecting the cells and shutting down their immune system, Trogarzo has a place in the MDR market and the growth will be based on new patients in the States and Europe."

"09:15 AM EDT, 07/11/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Theratechnologies Inc. (Theratechnologies) (TSX: TH) may add to the 5.3% lost Wednesday as Capital IQ noted the company reported a second quarter EPS normalized loss of $0.05 compared to a consensus mean forecast of $0.00 and revenues for the period of near $20.47 million compared to a forecast near $24.1 million"
"Quick summery from the chat today:On NASH the CEO said they are in sweet spot as if their future potential partner believes the trail needs to be modified they still can do it, he also said he is open to various forms of partnership whether it would include an upfront payment ($50M upfront payment was mentioned), milestones and THTX will run the trial or other partnerships agreement with the potential partner with better expertise will run the trial with THTX. They have engaged a company called MTS their website below:https://www.mtspartners.com/investment-banking/overviewCEO said they always had the partnership for NASH as some stage in their plans due to need of a bigger sale force for a potential approved drug.On oncology CEO said they are dosing patients every week and although they are currently dosing all comers they collect data from patients which have been already dosed looking for the rate of Sortilin overexpression. They will be updating the market re the oncology phase1 part1 by end of this year, and phase1 part 2 will start early next year however that time line can change based on the results and more interactions with FDA. The CFO said they are targeting 5 to 6 cancers each with a market size of up to 10000 patients and as per pricing of the drug he referenced to Trodelvy (another ADC) costing $200 k per year. SO again they are talking about $12B revenues.On F8 they expect launch next September and Trogarzo IV push mid-year next year. CEO also said they will keep Trogarzo IV on the market.As per recent ATM the CFO said they don’t need the cash now but they want that instrument in place based on better than expected oncology results and possible expansion of the trial which requires more funds, he also mentioned they might not need it at all anytime soon as a potential NASH partnership could come with an upfront payment."

"PRESS RELEASE: Paid content from Globe NewswirePress release content from Globe Newswire. The AP news staff was not involved in its creation.Theratechnologies’ Lead Peptide Drug Conjugate TH1902 Receives FDA Fast Track Designation for ...Theratechnologies30 minutes agoMONTREAL, Feb. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Theratechnologies Inc. (Theratechnologies) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, is pleased to announce that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted fast track designation to TH1902 as a single agent for the treatment of patients with sortilin positive recurrent advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy. “Receiving fast track designation for TH1902 at this early stage of development is a significant recognition for our SORT1+ Technology and further supports the future development of TH1902. The designation, which applies to all solid tumours expressing sortilin, also highlights the broad applicability and immense medical need for innovative, targeted, and potentially more effective and better-tolerated therapies for cancer,” said Dr. Christian Marsolais, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Theratechnologies."
"This article published in August 2021 gives a good detailed overview of cell penetrating peptides and their advantages as a targeted delivery technology. They touch based on peptides lipophilicity (ability to dissolve in fat), solubility, and small molecular sizes etc. which contribute to internalization of them into cancer cells. Cancer can remodel the cell membrane resulting in less anticancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic agent however CPPs are positive charged are biodegradable and often possess low immunogenicity and low toxicity and favor the negatively charged tumor membranes over those of healthy cells which are electrically neutral. The targeted drug delivery technology can bypass the multi drug resistance due to better selectivity, better bioaccessibility ( the fraction of the total amount of a substance that is potentially available for absorption) to the tumor cells, enhanced permeability and retention and “utilization of a homing device such as an antibody or a targeting ligand that will enable to attach to tumor cells through antigens or receptors on their surface, usually overexpressed in certain tumor types” among others. The article goes on and discuss the pros and cons of covalently or noncovalently bounds with anticancer agents and additional beneficial feature of coupling a chemotherapeutic with a CPP.“The ability to permeabilize in the membrane and gain access to the cytosolic compartment is largely dependent on the physicochemical qualities of the therapeutic entities including the most relevant such as lipophilicity (ability to dissolve in fat…), polarity (positive and negative charges at the ends of the molecule) and molecular size. Among them, a fairly but not excessively hydrophobic (water insoluble) character is most conducive to the drug transport; very large, polar hydrophilic molecules are being poorly internalized similarly as extremely hydrophobic (the former ones will fail to enter the membrane, the latter will enter readily but may have difficulty in leaving it). At the cellular level, most anticancer drugs act on membrane surface receptors or have intracellular targets. In the latter case, a drug must cross the cellular membrane that constitutes an additional barrier for it. A further complication for drug traversing the cellular membranes is their remodeling induced by cancer itself, which brings about complex changes in the membrane structure and composition. They lead to a drop in anticancer drug efficacy manifested by simultaneous cancer cell proliferation, avoidance of apoptosis and development of cellular resistance.Generally, anticancer therapy bears a high incidence of toxicity due to a low therapeutic index of the drugs and the simultaneous necessity for the usage of high doses in order to produce the clinical effect. An explanation for these unfavorable parameters of the anticancer therapy is lack of drug selectivity (they damage not only cancerous cells but also healthy rapidly growing ones) and poor bioaccessibility to the tumor cells. Another shortcoming of this therapy is multidrug resistance (MDR), which constitutes one of the dominant reasons for its failure. An attractive application of the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect in tumor chemotherapy comprises therapeutics in the form of liposomes, polymers or micelles. This effect has also been utilized by experimental technologies based on cell-penetrating peptides coupled with diverse types of cargoes (low molecular weight anticancer drugs). CPPs are a class of diverse short sequence peptides (usually <30 amino acids) of natural (protein-derived or chimeric) or synthetic origin.Internalization mechanisms of CPPsAccording to the available data, CPPs are internalized by two possible main pathways, i.e. endocytosis (energy dependent) and/or direct translocation (energy independent).The role of CPPs in cancer treatment (CPPs as vectors for anticancer drug delivery).The interaction of a CPP with cancerous cells should be considered in light of the current concept of cancer-induced modifications within the cell membrane itself. They concern both its heteropolysaccharide (They are compounds that are made up of two or more different types of monomer. Made up of the same repeating unit. As a rule, they are overexpressed in cancerous membranes) and lipid components (Also, the lipid component contributes to the anionic character of the cancerous membrane due to the exposition of the negatively charged phosphatidylserine in its outer leaflet which correlates with a more acidic pH of their external media as well), ensuring the uncontrolled growth, progression and invasiveness of the tumor cells.Generally, the CPPs possessing mostly cationic nature due to arginine and lysine residues favor the negatively charged tumor membranes over those of healthy cells, which are electrically neutral.Improvement of anticancer selectivity of CPPs"

"The paradox of THTX and the road of recoveryI believe this company is immensely undervalued/misunderstood, for those who don’t know recently a member of the stockhouse had a conference call with the CEO and chairwoman addressing the valuation discrepancies as a result of those conversations the company will be re-engineer in respect to conducting its operations including a revamped/alternative marketing strategy to address the depressed valuation so I just wanted to share some thoughts, I also would like to be clear despite my critics I am now more than ever confident about the company’s future prospects. The reason for the paradox of THTX is the company itself. As per market’s perception they are not a phase 3 NASH company due to again IMO incorrect messaging, they have been saying for a long time including the last interview with Paul that they will proceed with NASH, he also said there aren’t any issues with the agencies, first patient will be dosed in September, it is a tremendous opportunity and they want a piece of the pie… don’t get me wrong I am big fan of Paul but despite all those encouraging words he didn’t want to clarify whether they had meetings or will have meetings with the agencies. Also after announcement of General NASH they sold 1/3 of the company (the offering). Well actions speak louder than words.They aren’t ascribe a fair value for their PDC program by the market well how is it possible that nobody in the company gets updated re the progress of an open label trial? Sometimes saying nothing says everything and by withholding information they just confuse the market.As per commercialized drugs market is still hesitant about the future prospects as so far they have not managed to live up to their initial ambitious levels of sale forecasts, they still have the market size projection which is far bigger than the reality and refuse to give guidance quarterly or annually, fair enough giving guidance during uncertain times is a hard one but that has been an ongoing issue with the company.With all fairness they have done a good job selling the drugs during a prolonged period of lockdowns as their marketing strategies are much more effective and they have now two skilled marketing recruits also most if not all commercializing biotechs have had worse sales compared to pre pandemic levels but the absence of a guidance and an unreal mark projections just add more unnecessary confusion.So they are not a phase 3 NASH, they aren’t yet a phase 1 oncology and sales are everyone’s question atm. This is the perception of the company by the market and it didn’t need to be like that. Yes hard data from oncology, finalized/harmonized NASH protocol and resumption of the sale growth are all value enhancer events, every and each of them if materialized should boost the valuation but the SP based on eventuality of success in any of those operations should already have appreciated by some meaningful amount and should get another boost when and if any of those milestones have been achieved.The road to recovery for the company can be either long or short but won’t be easy, they really need to re-engineer and do it efficiently and fast.Paul has to realize he is not working for a well-known/connected company anymore so try common/well known third party platform targeting preferably more the retail investors more than once, build up an much bigger audience so potential positive announcements move the valuation higher due to increased demand/volume so institutions and wealthy retail investor can take positions, update and even better upgrade the website so it comes across more appealing add a science section for both NASH and oncology programs, add a partnership section, put the valuation of the comps on the investor presentation etc., every little piece of good results should be released instantly and separately rather than bundling up together so nothing get lost in the translation, give realistic market size/guidance for legacy drugs, don’t withhold none strategic information so market can build a clear picture of what this company is about where it is heading, buy more shares of the company to show your confidence is real, arrange for periodic investor webcasts so questions get addressed, reconstitute the board to a less populated yet more industry skilled board of managers which will also be reducing the expense for a cash strapped company taking on costly R&D programs also by doing that you can effectively show the market this company has a well composed and competent leadership and a strict cost control policy in place. Overall a clear and frequent shareholder communication so existing shareholders and future to be shareholders can share your enthusiasm with much more insights."

"Just trying to get a sense of the PDC industry so I found this article which has identified the players in the space, note despite the fact that it was published recently it is not up to date as some companies’ progresses are outdated. Overall it seems like the PDC space is fairly new and not many companies are currently involved in developing PDCs for various indications.“In recent years, technical improvements around the three elements of ADC drugs (antibody, payload, and linker) have been a hot research topic at the moment. Up to now, there are 11 ADC drugs approved for marketing worldwide, of which 6 ADCs are approved for marketing in 2019. The global market size of marketed ADC drugs is expected to exceed $16.4 billion by 2026.Currently, ADC drug research has experienced a pile-up of targets, overlapping indication layouts and similar forms. There is an urgent need for a number of manufacturers to come up with new ideas to solve the existing problems. Some companies have taken an alternative route and laid out peptide-drug conjugate (PDC), which is relatively less competitive.”https://www.biochempeg.com/article/199.htmlThey have lined up the current PDCs pipelines: The first two Lutathera (Novartis) and Pepaxto (Oncopeptides) are the only approved PDCs so far. Novartis at the moment is in a different league with multiple pipelines both commercial and R&D and currently valued at above $206B. Oncopeptides despite the recent set back due to mortality issues with their drug is still is valued at $838M, hey started the commercialization of Pepaxto and other than that their pipeline mostly is related to their PDC.Angiochem is a phase 3 biotech with a PDC targeting brain tumor apart from that they have some preclinical projects related to Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes/obesity, pain and Lysosomal Storage Diseases, still a private company.Bicycle therapeutics’s PDC phase 2 targeting two cancers and beside that they have preclinical projects in IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY, market cap $760M. They do have partnership in place with Astra Zeneca as per below.“Leveraging the high bioavailability of Bicycles as topical inhaled agents, in November 2016 Bicycle partnered with a world leader in respiratory science, AstraZeneca, to evaluate the potential for local delivery of inhaled Bicycles in the lung. In the same collaboration, AstraZeneca is evaluating Bicycles for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. AstraZeneca is using its therapy area expertise and access to significant resources to lead the optimization of Bicycles identified by the Bicycle platform. In addition to the significant patient benefit that can result from leveraging the Bicycle technology in these diseases, Bicycle can receive >$1B in milestone payments, as well as single digit royalties should all products reach the market. In May 2018, Bicycle and AstraZeneca expanded their collaboration to include additional targets in respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Two assets have been transitioned to AstraZeneca for further development and are currently being progressed in their discovery pipeline.”Inspyr Therapeutic is a preclinical PDC biotech focused on the development of targeted cancer therapeutics for the treatment of cancerous tumors, including breast, prostate, bladder, kidney, and lung cancer. It seems like they haven’t done much with their preclinical project due to financing issues and only currently valued at $4M.Spirogen LTD is a Member of the AstraZeneca Group and their drug seems to be actually an ADC still preclinical.Soricimed Biopharma is a preclinical PDC company and private.Cybrexa Therapeutics is a phase 1 PDC now targeting advanced solid tumor with few preclinical projects for their CBS series in cancer also a private company. Note I have not looked at those public companies books but apart from the first two the rest are only R&D companies with no revenues."

"It seems unlike fast track designation the BTD can’t be requested at IND stage, the drug needs to show safety and good efficacy among others to be considered for BTD. It could be as early as during phase1 but ideally not later than end of phase2. It is somehow hard to look at historical examples.The PDC technology is quite new compared to specifically traditional chemotherapy and ADC. We all know the advantages of targeted drug delivery versus traditional chemo but compared to ADC there are some clinical and other benefits such as in case of PDC the use smaller molecules which can bypass the MDR easier(penetration of tumour cells), better solubility, less immune reaction also cheaper to manufacture.Generally speaking the clinical advantages of PDCs and targeted drug delivery in theory could end up with surprising good safety and efficacy early in the process so it all depends on the results if really promising they can apply for the BTD at the end of part1 phase1. They had really good results on late stage cancers with sortilin over expression up to 80% in animal models if they can duplicate those results in humans especially as their PDC only needs 1/4 of dosage compared to docetaxel alone they could be at a therapeutic dose by now absent toxicity, by end of 6th cycle they will be well above those therapeutic windows so primary significant tumour regression early on during the trial is quite possible, that would be definitely a good case to apply for break through therapy designation.I was hoping that they would share more data but it turn out to be wishful thinking maybe they want to share after end of part1 when more patients have been dosed so the PoC is more reliable, their optimistic language during the webinar to me is a very good sign that thus far results are good which is great. Later on if the results are promising they can apply for priority review and accelerated approval as well so I guess the explanation of wide estimated duration of the program varying from 2 to 5 years depends on the rolling results.For instance during webinar it was said that 230mg/m2 of their PDC is at or above 100mg/m2 Docetaxel( therapeutic dosage for docetaxel alone) by end of sixth cycle, no toxicity they will reach 560mg/m2 which is over 240 percent above Docetaxel’s therapeutic dosage.That is if confirmed a very good indication that good or great efficacy could be reached thus a tumour regression as a result.“ADCs can also generate dangerous immune reactions, yielding toxicity and halting further therapy.28 Furthermore, the complicated structure of ADCs results in high production costs, in some cases restricting access to these drugs as their cost-effectiveness may be called into question by health insurers. Owing to their high molecular weight and protein-like physicochemical properties, ADCs also suffer from restricted distribution which can prevent these therapies from penetrating some types of solid tumours and limiting their efficacy.To overcome these issues, many research groups have explored alternative approaches such as peptide-based drugs, protein–protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs) and drug delivery transporters.”https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cs/d0cs00556h#!divAbstract“There are multiple approaches that a sponsor may utilize to show substantial improvement. For example, a head-to-head comparison of the new drug to the current standard of care in an early stage trial may offer enough evidence of a meaningful basis for the breakthrough designation. Early patient data without a direct comparison in a clinical trial study that provides better understanding of disease progression may also suffice. For instance, if a certain cancer type has an 80 percent progression rate in a one-year period, yet a drug in early trials shows a 10 percent progression during the same timeframe, a head-to-head trial to prove substantial improvement may not be needed.[25]”https://pharmdevgroup.com/fda-expedited-programs-explained/“An effect on an established surrogate endpointAn effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint considered reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit (i.e., the accelerated approval standard)An effect on a pharmacodynamic biomarker(s) that does not meet criteria for an acceptable surrogate endpoint, but strongly suggests the potential for a clinically meaningful effect on the underlying diseaseA significantly improved safety profile compared to available therapy (e.g., less dose-limiting toxicity for an oncology agent), with evidence of similar efficacyA drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for the following:All Fast Track designation featuresIntensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1Organizational commitment involving senior managersIdeally, a Breakthrough Therapy designation request should be received by FDA no later.."

"Quick SummaryThe legacy drugsThe company is Optimistic on Egrifta’s sales for instance the visceral fat increases the severity of COVID19 so they will be using that methodology among other marketing efforts to increase the sales of Egrifta also the F8 will be having a positive effect on Egrifta sales. They will be using the social media more often to reach out to patients going forward for both drugs. As per Paul the MDR opportunities are increasing. The reimbursement of Trogarzo restarts as soon as lockdowns are lifted in the Europe. They are not happy with sales in 2020 despite the record sales and will be working hard to increase the sales post pandemic. Over 200 attendees when they launched in Germany only. They are lining up a number of patients to have access to Trogarzo as soon the lockdowns are lifted in Europe. The phase 3 IV push for Trogarzo will be completed by end of 2021, also the phase 2/3 for IM will be starting in coming weeks. The investment they have done to change the sale’s marketing will have a lasting effect post pandemic. R&D ProgramsThey reconfirmed their R&D trails are on schedule for both oncology and NASH phase 3.Fast track designation for oncology based on preclinical is unique.They are in final discussions with both agencies and plan to meet up with both FDA and EMA to align the protocol for NASH phase 3 so both agencies are board for the scheduled trial by end of Q3. A Common program to be finalized by mid-year for NASH.SGNA in line in the next fiscal year possibly a bit higher due to reimbursement of Trogarzo in the Europe."

"This article published today highlights the dual MOA approach of Tesamorelin for treatment of NAFLD/NASH. Some details from this study so they are explaining the proteomic (studying proteins) and transcriptomic (studying molecules expressed from the genes) effect of tesamorelin a dual approach for the treatment of NAFL/NASH. Nothing new but they sum it up nicely and tied some loose ends (totality of data). I like the fact that they mentioned innovative treatment few times.“Tesamorelin suppressed key angiogenic (blood vessel growth), fibrogenic (promoting the development of fibers) and pro-inflammatory mediators. CSF1 (gene), a regulator of monocyte (white blood cell that fight infections) recruitment and activation, may serve as an innovative therapeutic target for NAFLD in HIV.Notably, compared to the general population, NAFLD has a more aggressive clinical course with a high frequency of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, and an accelerated rate of fibrosis progression among PLWH.Within the tesamorelin-treated arm, reductions in plasma VEGFA (gene) and CSF1 correlated with a decline in NAS score. Furthermore, among tesamorelin-treated participants, reductions in TGFB1 (gene) and CSF1were associated with a decline in gene-level fibrosis score. Notably, among tesamorelin-treated participants, decreases in plasma levels of VEGFA and CSF1 correlated with a reduction in NAS score, whereas declines in TGFB1 and CSF1 were associated with a decrease in fibrosis-related gene score. Human and animal studies have shown hepatic upregulation of TGFB1 expression with NASH and fibrosis. Moreover, in a NASH mouse model, hepatocyte (liver cells)-specific TGFB receptor type II deficiency reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, hepatic stellate cell activation, and collagen deposition17. Given the role of TGFB1 in NAFLD, the decline in this growth factor with tesamorelin may contribute to its attenuation of NAFLD, and particularly fibrosis, progression in PLWH.Taken together, in this focused proteomic analysis guided by a whole transcriptomic approach, we identified VEGFA, TGFB1, and CSF1 as novel proteins whose circulating levels were reduced by tesamorelin in association with a decline in NAFLD severity among PLWH with NAFLD. The current study extends our knowledge of the biologic actions of GH axis augmentation to encompass systemic changes in key angiogenic, fibrogenic, and pro-inflammatory factors that may underlie a tesamorelin response. Notably, among these proteins, CSF1 is a key regulator of monocyte recruitment and activation that has not been previously well studied in the context of NAFLD, but may serve as an innovative therapeutic target in this regard. Lastly, our data indicate that VEGFA, TGFB1, and CSF1 are candidate biomarkers for a tesamorelin response among PLWH with NAFLD, which should be explored in future studies.”https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89966-y"
"As per THTX using National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases data last reviewed November 2016 it is believed that 3 to 12 percent of adult Americans have NASH.As per this study published recently on Journal of Hepatology using both noninvasive diagnostic methods and diagnosis by performing biopsies the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in asymptomatic middle aged cohorts were 38% and 14%. Also some 6% of the cohorts had significant liver fibrosis.The condition is a silent killer with growing prevalence. The market opportunity for Egrifta if approved in the US only is huge. “There are no prospective studies to determine how common is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In a large number of asymptomatic middle-aged Americans, we used a combination of state-of-the-art liver imaging methods and liver biopsy to prospectively determine the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH. NAFLD was diagnosed in 38%, NASH in 14%, and significant liver fibrosis in 6% of asymptomatic middle-aged Americans.”https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(21)00176-8/fulltext"

"Quick summary of today’s webinar:This presentation was very scientific covering their PDC technology very well, not much was addressed regarding the potential financial prospects but they did mention their technology can expand to other therapeutic areas thus bigger financial opportunities, neither did they update us regarding the trial’s progress but it was mentioned it is progressing well.The higher sort1 expression the higher patient survival as their targeted drug delivery will be working more effectively.Doxorubicin alone has narrow therapeutic window versus their PDC.High percentage of sort1 on small cell long thus better conjunction of TH1902.Multi drug resistance is like a molecular vacuum cleaner but their PDC bypass that as it internalize to cancer cells rapidly.VM (vascular mimicry) was mentioned few times (stopping blood flow to cancer cells).SiSortilin silences the VM, also to minimize the VM Docetaxel needs to be at much higher dosage than their PDC, by minimizing the VM the th1902 can be used as a very promising treatment for cancers.They mentioned two key resistance MDR1 and VM in both cases their PDC bypasses both by minimizing VM and rapid internalization into cancer cells, so basically they increase the therapeutic window of Docetaxel.In animal studies they can use only three cycles of Docetaxel before getting adverse effects (loss of weight) versus their PDC can be used for more cycles without side effects.Docetaxel alone doesn’t work on colorectal but TH1902 has long lasting effects on the cancer. They put some comparable dosing between their PDC and Docetaxel such as Docetaxel 3.75 mg/kg MTD versus Th1902 8.75mg/kg equivalent to that dose of Docetaxel, Docetaxel 15mh/kg MTD versus Th1902 35mg/kg equaling Docetaxel, They confirmed again 1/4 dosage of Th1992 compared to Docetaxel will be showing therapeutic results. As it was mentioned earlier 230mg/m2 of their PDC is at or above 100mg/m2 Docetaxel (therapeutic level) so after 4th cycle of the PDC they could potentially start seeing tumor regression.They touch based on systematic infection and neutropenia sepsis is leading cause of mortality, neutropenia causes prolonged hospitalization by decreasing that using target delivery they can increase the therapeutic window of the drug.By end of summer, beginning of fall they probably will be releasing some safety and early sign of efficacy of part1 of phase1 trial. Basket trial most likely start in early 2022.All comers initially as the FDA want to see the correlation between the activity of the PDC and expression of receptors (to determine the expression of receptor in relationship to efficacy of the drug).Paul last slide was suggesting they are open to change the design of the trial for instance dosing schedule (weekly, intermittent versus continual) exploring a combination of their sort1 technology with other treatments specifically immunotherapies., exploring conjunction with variety of chemotherapeutic agents and potential synergistic new partnership (proprietary molecules) so they will be exploring the potential of their technology in more therapeutic areas."

"This morning's selling pressure makes no sense. The conference call was good news. Management needs to do a better job communicating, but there was nothing to suggest we should be selling. The future potential to capture the NASH market for those with HIV is an enormous value proposition even if we have to wait a little while longer to see monetary results. The company is already producing revenue unlike other drug companies. I didn't expect the stock to start dropping after that conference call this morning."

"Sales up 62.6% for the quarter and positive adjusted EBITDA of $453K. Considering the short-term increase in cost to launch Trogarzo, this looks like a great report.

"What a good day for shareholders today. Patience will be rewarding us. Still beleive that $6-$7 range is the right price for TH, fairly short term. Hold long"
"Clearly the short-term holders are taking advantage of the spike and selling the last 2 days. Disappointing, but I reminded someone yesterday, I'm not in this for a dollar or two gain. There is major price appreciation owed this stock, and the market will eventually figure it out. Holding long."
"Quick Summary from the call today.Oncology:They are very positive about Sort1 technology so far, TH1902 offering a different PK profile with potential better tolerability and efficacy, the patient enrolling is going well, the study is proceeding well.All for CRO’s are screening for patients, the reason for announcement of part1 phase1 in Q4 and not earlier is they need to wait three months for additional testing before updating the market regarding safety and potential efficacy results.NASH:Agencies were pleased what they saw in NASH data, during early interactions with agencies the company was actually told to consider general NASH also that idea was backed by KOLs.They have a ready to proceed phase 3 NASH trial both in Europe and US, as they have to include a futility analysis(increases the cost by 25%) and enroll more patients the cost of the trial will be higher than anticipated so they are exploring the options to partner up for the program, as per the CEO they are in a position of strength during the negotiations with interested partners which have already started, they also have strong patent for NAFLD/NASH, during Q&A the CEO confirmed absent any partner they certainly won’t give up on NASH as they have worked hard to get the protocol to where it is now.Also they are starting a trial in 2022 investigating Tesamorelin’s roll in PLWH with cognition impairment lasting 6 months. Sales:Egrifta sales was better than expected despite the pandemic, SV was up over 10% compared to a year ago with better margins than Egrifta.Trogarzo’s sales was down 6% YOY due to among others lower unit sales as patients were told to stay at home during pandemic, also last year they had big orders in the beginning of the year as pharmacy’s were building up their inventory due to the pandemic. They are optimistic about sales going forward and the negotiations in Europe will now resume.Financial position:They have about $57M almost equal to end of February (last Q) so the cash burn was almost zero, going forward they believe the SGNA and R&D expenses will be steady until they start the NASH phase 3 trial.Overall business plans: They want to build up a talented team by bringing skilled employees to progress with R&D and commercial part of business. Due to pandemic they are increasing resources to handle the pandemic related complexity, for instance patients prerequisite specifically for Trogarzo was down during 2020, first half 2021 so they added recruits with marketing skills to mitigate the issue."
"Institutional short sellers have been driving potential gains down, as it relates to many companies’ stocks; therefore, if THTX can maintain any gains received by its most recent news regarding the FDA, in the wake of the short interest in the stock, we can see the stock price increase exponentially; but first it has to prove its resilience against the shorts. I believe it can."
I cannot believe someone is selling right now and dropping the share price like this. We will know efficacy results of oncology before year-end. NASH is still moving forward. Cash burn is lower than other drug companies since we have two commercial products. New innovations in the pipeline. Makes no sense to me.
something is cooking sick volume

"It seems investors have putting their bets on big pharmaceutical companies and IPOs this year rather than small cap biotech. As per this article there is a large gap between big and small biotech companies which should based on past experiences close.Hopefully with potential good results from oncology trial, positive developments in THTX’s NASH protocol and closing valuation gaps we see a decent return on our investment soon in this ignored little company with great prospects. “The market-weighted Nasdaq Biotech Index is up 8.7% year to date due largely to Moderna, while the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, which tracks the equal-weighted S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index and is seen as more of a proxy for small caps, has declined 13% year-to-date. Still, overall gaps between small and large caps historically don’t last long. The recent underperformance comes amid heightened competition for investors’ dollars, according to Oppeinheimer analyst Hartaj Singh. Those who focus on biotechs have had a healthy crop of initial public offerings, splitting their attention with a slew of existing biotechs. July marked a record month for the number of these deals in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.JMP’s Butler said the successes of the large companies tend to signal that smaller ones are soon to follow suit. During downturns in 2015 and at the end of 2018, larger-cap biotechs led the recovery, followed closely by their smaller counterparts, he said. Corrections of this size are usually followed by recoveries, added Roderick Wong, chief investment officer of RTW Investments. “At a minimum we would expect the gap in performance to narrow between small-cap biotech and others.For Brakel, the potential for positive clinical trial results in the coming months coupled with the current low valuations creates a buying opportunity.”https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/small-cap-biotech-stocks-play-120000602.html"
Reality is that this Phase III is going to be a long time---and unfortunately this one is not going to do much in the way of moving up until it gets closer to the end of the study. Earning's may be better but this company is going to continue to need cash to move along in a big way---

"Quick summary for the conference yesterday:It is encouraging to hear the first patient has now received the second dose in oncology trial. It seems they have been actively interacting with FDA (questions from both parties have been submitted and addressed so far, they want to get all tips and recommendation by the FDA before perfecting the NASH trial). Paul answered my question re Europe. They are having a meeting with EMA as well so Europe is very much on the table. The NASH phase 3 trial is on schedule to start in Q3. As per CEO Tesamorelin will be great candidate for a potential combination therapy. The pen injector is already used by diabetic patient thus the method of administration will be marketable among cohorts. Lastly the Trogarzo IV push trial is almost conducted and is ready for submission to the agencies and should be commercialize in 2022 followed by IM version later in the same year."
Thera should partner with NOVO NORDISK - these guys are looking at NASH via its GLP1 analog (ozempic) and oral in near future.

The webinar will feature a presentation by Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Richard Bliveau, Ph.D. (Universit du Qubec Montral) who will discuss the science of receptor-mediated cancer therapy and the discovery of sortilin as a novel target in cancer treatment. Dr. Bliveau will be available to answer questions following the formal presentations. Theratechnologies' management team will also give an update on their oncology pipeline including TH1902, the Company's lead investigational peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) stemming from its SORT1+ Technology in oncology. SORT1+ Technology is a new class of cancer treatment targeting all sortilin-expressing cancers by linking approved anticancer drugs to a proprietary peptide that specifically binds to the sortilin receptor. The PDC is internalized by the sortilin receptor and the therapeutic agent is released directly inside the cancer cell. TH1902 was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a single agent for the treatment of all advanced solid tumors expressing sortilin that are refractory to standard therapy and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial."

"Getting pass the sticking pointI have been waiting for a long time to see the company starting hard marketing of their drugs.Egrifta was launched a head of it’s time as the drug has many therapeutic benefits which has been discovered as the science has been evolving.The company projected compounded sale growth of 20 per cent annually, the question is how?Well limited time promotional programs have been very successful to get to point of sale regardless of nature of the goods or services.This is exactly what is happening now with both drugs, as per Egrifta still having the stigma of a cosmetic drug it is important to create an incentive for patients to initiate the treatment and the results speak for themselves.Trogarzo has a very high compliance therefore once on Trogarzo patients stay put so to get pass the first hurdle starting patients on the drug is the main sticking point.https://www.couponxoo.com/tesamorelin-coupon"

"Both Gettysburg Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center are still recruiting patients. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=TH1902&cntry=&state=&city=&dist= https://www.mdanderson.org/patients-family/diagnosis-treatment/clinical-trials/clinical-trials-index/clinical-trials-detail.ID2021-0030.html I am going to revisit the schedule of dose escalation, as per the trial’s description the study will use Accelerated Titration Designs for Phase I by Simon et al.(1997) which has 4 designs: “ Design 1 is the standard 3+3 Dose steps are defined by a modified Fibonacci series in which the increments of dose for succeeding levels are 100%, 67%, 50%, and 40%, followed by 33% for all subsequent levels. Three patients are usually treated at a dose level and observed for acute toxicity for one course of treatment before any more patients are entered. If none of the three patients experience DLT, then the next cohort of three patients is treated at the next higher dose. If two or more of the three patients experience DLT, then three more patients are treated at the next lower dose unless six patients have already been treated at that dose. If one of three patients treated at a dose experiences DLT, then three more patients are treated at that same level. If the incidence of DLT among those six patients is one in six, then the next cohort is treated at the next higher dose. In general, if two or more of the six patients treated at a dose level experience DLT, then the MTD is considered to have been exceeded, and three more patients are treated at the next lower dose as described above. Designs 3 and 4 also use only one patient per cohort during the early stage of the trial, but they incorporate more rapid dose escalation by using double-dose steps during this stage. With design 3, the single-patient-cohort stage of the trial also terminates when one patient experiences first-course DLT or two patients experience first-course grade 2 toxicity. Design 2 treats one patient per dose level until one patient exhibits DLT or two patients exhibit grade 2 toxicity during their first course of treatment. At that time, the escalation plan switches to design 1. That is, two additional patients are accrued at the dose that triggered the switch, and three to six patients are treated in that and each subsequent cohort. This approach offers the possibility of speeding up the trial and reducing the number of patients assigned to low doses. It uses the first instance of first-course DLT to trigger the switch as proposed by Storer. It also uses first-course grade 2 toxicity to provide an added element of caution. We use the second instance of grade 2 toxicity for practical reasons, since it is often difficult to determine whether a grade 2 toxicity is drug related in a heterogeneous population of very ill patients. With design 4, this accelerated stage terminates when the first instance of DLT or the second instance of grade 2 toxicity is observed in any course of treatment. In either case, after the rapid escalation stage terminates, subsequent cohort sizes are three to six patients and single-dose escalation steps are used as in design 1.” The reason for choosing the modified rapid dose escalations is: “Although most patients who participate in phase I trials hope to obtain therapeutic benefit from promising new experimental treatments, few achieve this objective. Whereas most patients would not have derived benefit from drugs studied in phase I trials, even if treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), treating patients at substantially lower doses is likely to further reduce whatever chance for benefit might exist. A second problem with current designs is that phase I trials may take a long time to complete, especially when the starting dose is far below the MTD (3). Current phase I trials also provide almost no information about variability among patients in the dose that can be tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or about whether there is evidence of cumulative toxicity.” https://brb.nci.nih.gov/techreport/AcceleratedTitration.pdf So they will dosing one patient per dose until one patient shows DLT (dose limiting toxicities) at that time, the escalation plan switches to design 1.Absent any toxicity they started with 30mg/m2 and doubled the dose for the first two cycles by May 3 they would be at 120mg/m2 then applying modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme (67%, 50%, 40% and 33%) forth cycle would be at a dose=120x1.67%=200mg/m2 May 24, fifth cycle 200mg/m2x1.5=300 mg/m2 June 14.Sixth cycle 300mg/m2x1.4=420mg/m2 July 5, seventh Cycle 420mg/m2x1.33=559mg/m2 July 26. The company said they need one fourth of PDC dosages versus docetaxel alone to have therapeutic effects even bypassing that as per current recommendation docetaxel can have therapeutic effect starting at or just below 100mg/m2. So theoretically if no toxicity at and above the forth cycle their PDC wi"

Theratechnologies Files Marketing Authorization Application for Trogarzo in Europe https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-08-28/theratechnologies-files-marketing-authorization-application-for-trogarzo-in-europe
CEO is not delivering. He needs to step up to the plate.
"NASH KOL event:As per Paul the company has significant R&D opportunities.Dr. Harrison touched based on the prevalence of the condition, a quarter of population have fatty liver disease, 37% of middle age Americans have NAFLD based on none invasive diagnostics and 14% of those patients have NASH(after performing biopsies). A quarter of patients develop cirrhosis over their life time with a rate of 2, 5% decomposition of liver annually.As per the re generative nature of the liver when exposed to assault it tries to heal itself resulting in scar tissues caused by inflammation among others so best route to deal with condition is to remove the cause of it such as insulin resistance.He mentioned NASH has two components one ballooning (liver cell injuries) and the other one inflammation leading to fibrosis. He also mentioned safety issues was a hindrance for drugs to be approved, NASH is a heterogeneous condition so some drugs work for a group of patients and not for others. To tackle the problem he suggested a combo approach (different mechanism of actions) or utilizing mechanism that are higher up in the pathogenesis of disease like Tesamorelin(targeting pathways than are high up that can per inhibit multiple mechanism downhill thus broader efficacy) rather than being laser focused on certain mechanism. He also said mono therapy are not successful so far therefore they need combination therapy mixing injections and orals.Lobular inflammation and ballooning are associated with visceral fat also reducing visceral has a role in extra hepatic diseases like cardio vascular diseases.As for combo therapy he suggested thyroid hormone beta agonist(oral) which is well tolerated like Tesamorelin or other drugs like structurally engineered fatty acids as candidates however initially it’s wiser to try Tesamorelin in mono therapy and eventually as a backbone drug in a combo treatment. He believes it’s important to have well tolerable drugs as they will be used for a while for patients suffering from the condition.Dr. Grinspoon also reinstated Tesamorelin has multiple MOAs targeting the indications (Tesamorelin can be by itself a combo therapy). He referenced visceral fat as bad depot, Tesamorelin reduces that which has positive cardiovascular effects and subcutaneous fat is good fat depot, therefore BMI only should not be used as an indicator for the condition, he also mentioned Tesamorelin could be a backbone therapy for a combination therapy. He mentioned Tesamorelin approved since 2010 has a very good safety profile and did not alter glucose in diabetic patients (comorbidity associated with NAFLD/NASH) as per previous studies performed by THTX. The CMO elaborated on the slide with the phase 3 trial design which is rather large therefore it has two parts, Part 1 randomized 1 to 1(enough placebo patients to reduce the background noise when reading the biopsy results and 18 months thus better effect on fat reduction) and part 2 (post approval). Dr. Harrison commented on the design as a nice design with a drug which has great safety profile. Futility trial performed on more than half the patients in part one will be included to see if they should continue with the trial (de-risking the trial).Paul also mentioned 3 advantages for their program, safety of the drug, upstream MOA of the drug which has 18 months to work and the fact they learned from others failures before putting together a well-designed trial. They touch based on eventually moving to non-invasive diagnostic such as presence of bio markers (blood test) and imaging diagnostic They have a well powered study plus futility analysis as per Dr. Loomba and that is the strength of the program."

"wouldn't a but out be the end of the rally? interesting though, that a company with a 1.7 rating, higher than Amazon, is so quite with news, and next to no posts over the last few months."
"$THTX Once the cancer programs and especially the NASH protocol get validated by an approval from agencies anybody who will be selling at theses prices must be out of his mind.The further the protocols progress the more value should be ascribed to the company, the oncology programs can progress faster and company can update the market during the process so the prospects of THTX as a short, medium to long term investment can be very promising.Definitely a very interesting speculative atm (absolutely after the approved applications) investment, hopefully the company not only execute on all the projects but also follow that up by decent marketing.Note a couple of years ago the market valued this company 1 billion dollars based on Trogarzo capturing 20% 0f 20000 shrinking MDR market, now NASH a multi billion dollar market with growing prevalence and an unmet lethal medical condition and PDC with a market of 25 billion dollars projected to double in the next 5 years THTX is a bargain."
"The information yesterday on the KOL call was very interesting and full of potential prospects for cancer, yet here we see selling again. Clearly we need a different investor mix who sees the potential of what is more and more likely coming."

Creative Financial Designs Inc added almost 110 k shares to their position as per their filing today. Average price per shares $3.87.RBC also added not long ago. https://fintel.io/sob/us/thtx
big day tomorrow
Why is this trading at such a large discount to the most recent financing?
"THTX for retail investorsThe company’s CEO have bachelor of science in biochemistry, CFO has master of business science, CMO has Ph.D. in biochemistry and General Manager in EU has Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees Between just four of them they have over 100 years of management experience in the industry.Their research and development programs includes Cancer programs and None Alcoholic Steatohepatitis NASH (fatty liver disease).ONCOLOGYTheir cancer drugs TH 1902 and TH 1904 are peptides (small proteins), the innovative approach for the cancer programs is based on a technology to deliver therapeutic agents to the organs. These peptides bind to anticancer agents they also bind to receptors (sortilin) which are commonly presented in many cancer types, this receptor get attached and surrounded by cancer cell membrane and enter the cell and form a spherical structure, later on the skin of that structure breaks down and release the receptor inside the cancer cells so the anticancer agents kill the cancer cells. The advantage of this technique versus other anticancer approaches is as a portion of other drugs will be resisted by cell membrane therefore it will be less concentration of their drugs which manages to enter the cancer cells.Also their cancer technology inhibits vascular mimicry which is the progress the tumor cells organize themselves to a channel to provide blood to other cancer cells.The beauty of this technology is that it can deliver other therapeutic agents to the targeted cell although the company now only exploring this mechanism of action on anti-cancer agents.This technology can be used to treat various cancer types such as Melanoma(market size $12 billion by 2025), Pancreatic cancer( market size $4 billion by 2025) Colorectal cancer(market size $17billion by 2025) Endometrial cancer(market size 12 billion by 2027), Triple Negative Breast Cancer (Market size $55 billion by 2027) , Ovarian cancer(market size $3 billion by 2022) Neuroendocrine tumors(market size over 2 $ billion), Lung cancer(market size $37 billion), Soft tissue cancer( market size $3,6 billion) so between now and 2027 the combined market opportunity would be about $146 billion! The company recently got Fast Track Designation which only be approved by FDA for drugs which are under development for unmet conditions, this designation accelerate the trial progress and finally the potential approval will be faster and sooner. They are scheduled to start the trial in March this year. NASH Tesamorelin directly stimulate production of Growth Hormone which reduces Visceral fat (fat round the body’s organ), decreases storage of fat, improve energy production by cells, decreases inflammation. The drug indirectly also stimulate production of Insulin-like Growth factor-1 in liver which decrease insulin resistance( less liver fat), decreases liver inflammation and deactivate liver cells which cause infection.Also it was recently proved that Tesamorelin has inhibiting effect on pro inflammatory proteins causing inflammation if untreated causing infections. Their treatment approach is innovative while other approaches have failed for more than a decade.NASH is a lethal disease with growing prevalence globally with no approved drug to date, as per company’s presentation only in the US there were over 16 million NASH patients in 2019 which is projected to reach 27 million patients by 2030. NASH market size globally was over $1 billion in 2017 and projected to reach over 21 billion in 2025.The have patent coverage for Tesamorelin in NASH in the US and Europe and considering extending the protection to other parts of the world.The company is scheduled to start the Phase 3 NASH trial by end of third quarter this year. LEGACY DRUGS They have two approved drugs currently commercialized, Trogarzo is an antiviral drug with long lasting effect treating patients with HIV and is currently commercialized in the US and Germany, will be launched in 4 other European countries and Israel.Tesamorelin is treating Liodysrophyfor HIV patients (abnormal amount/distribution of fat) currently commercialized in the North America.Last quarter they had record sales despite the Covid19 pandemic and projected to increase the sales by over %240 in the next 4 years."

Let's see what interesting things we learn on Monday from the investor conference.
"Picked up 6,000 shares between 2.95- 3.00. If this company never grows a inch it’s still worth $6. 2020 gonna be a good year!"
"The article sums up nicely the MOA of their PDC, looking through it I found a couple interesting things. So they are saying due to rapid, (less than 5 hours) cytotoxic effect of the drug supports significant ligand internalization also overexpression of Bcl-xL a transmembrane molecule in the mitochondria has been observed in various cancers these molecules’ presence have been linked to resistance to various taxanes such as docetaxel and down regulation of the protein showed an increased sensitivity to chemo agent, faster cell death by their PDC resulted in reduction of these proteins thus less chemoresistance. They also say the PDC both intravenous and within the peritoneal cavity (the area that contains the abdominal organs) are well tolerated.TH1902, a new docetaxel‐peptide conjugate for the treatment of sortilin‐positive triple‐negative breast cancer - Demeule - - Cancer Science - Wiley Online Library"
"Speculation around Dr. Grinspoon releasing his findings in a major medical journal very soon has picked up again. If this happens, should help increase sales and may even help with the FDA potentially allowing an update to Egrifta's label."
"Wow, such huge gains last couple of days and then this drop...Maybe caused by the new financing round in the news yesterday, so more dilution?"
"This stock has incredible upside potential, both for tumor and HIV related treatments. If the clinical trials follow the success of the animal research, we could be looking at an appreciation of 10x to 20x, even before takeover interest. So staying long, even buying more."
This is an interesting stock. I've done some research and see the Canadian pension fund has it a sizeable portion of their portfolio and they have some promising drugs in the pipeline as well as some FDA drugs that have decent sales. I wonder what the stock could be worth minus the pipeline drugs. It seems like they have a viable business and some of the profit is going towards R&D for the pipeline. I think the current drug sales would warrant a good price by itself but I don't know what a good price would be.

"So perhaps the pandemic learned lessons will make the agencies more flexible especially in areas of unmet diseases.“The big takeaway for me, based on the past several months, is the importance of collaboration across the US government agencies and with international counterparts and the research community,” Cavazzoni said. “The other important takeaway is having a regulatory framework that allows us to be agile and flexible.”https://endpts.com/fda-center-directors-on-lessons-from-the-eua-pathway-flexibility-serves-us-well/Unfortunately the pandemic which now lasted more than anticipated also has caused disruptions for elective treatments so many cancer patients are not diagnosed in time and advance to more late stage cancers sad but true.“We conclude that compared to the pre-pandemic period, the COVID pandemic was associated with a 40.4% decrease in the number of colorectal cancers diagnosed in a year’s time,” Maria J. Domper Arnal, of the Lozano Blesa University Hospital in Spain, said during a press conference. “Patients diagnosed of colorectal cancer during the pandemic period were older, had more frequent symptoms, an increased number of complications and a 20% more advanced stage of the disease.”https://www.healio.com/news/gastroenterology/20211004/colorectal-cancer-diagnoses-dropped-by-40-during-pandemicIt seems targeted drug delivery is getting more recognition and their role in treating various diseases among others cancer is getting the attention of the industry.“Peptides are gaining increasing interest as potential therapeutics, especially in clinical fields where classical small molecules have, to date, not been successful. Although they face challenges such as short half and shelf lives due to proteolytic cleavage and fast kidney clearance, they bear advantages over small molecule drugs as they are potentially less toxic and more selective. Additionally, due to their selective binding, peptides can be used as shuttle systems to target drugs to certain diseased sites, thereby reducing systemic side effects. This Special Issue aims at compiling new and exciting insights into the prosperous field of peptide-based drug and delivery systems, including synthesis and biomedical evaluation of both peptidic drugs and peptide–drug conjugates for targeted delivery.

"I would like to share this with you.Targeted drug delivery versus traditional cancer treatmentsThis article published recently discusses the limitation of traditional cancer therapy and the advantages of targeted drug delivery (mitigating the obstacles for the treatment of breast cancer).Below is my summary of few interesting points. Intrinsic toxicity to healthy organs:The targeted delivery results in higher tumour selectivity via targeting to malignant cells, (enhanced host acceptability) thus decreasing accumulation in healthy tissues and reduced off-target toxicities, also targeted delivery demonstrates a pH-sensitive supported release of the drug in a low pH environment along with selective accumulation in cancer cells compared to non-malignant cells resulting in selective cytotoxicity of the drug delivery system.Therefore the targeted drug delivery can increase the concentration of chemotherapeutic payload conjugated at equivalent concentrations to which the free drug alone may not be clinically tolerable. Tumour chemoresistance:As the chemotherapeutic agent flows out of cells using transporters such as various proteins resulting in less concentration of anticancer agent in the cancer cells thus less therapeutic effects!! however the targeted drug delivery escapes the chemoresistance as they don’t activated those transporters therefore the intracellular concentration of the drug is higher compared to standalone chemotherapeutic agent. As a result the multi drug resistance in traditional chemotherapy is mitigated by the targeted drug delivery technology. Improved cytotoxic activity:The targeted drug delivery has prolonged circulation time/ intracellular drug retention and increasing intracellular uptake versus the traditional chemotherapies. Reversal of tumour-induced immunosuppression:Systemic immunosuppression is regulated by a range of mechanisms, including overexpression of immune regulatory cells however the targeted delivery seem to down regulate some of the factors which have immunosuppressive activity resulting in increased efficacy of therapy. Prevention of metastasis:Targeted drug delivery demonstrates prolonged circulation time and increased systemic circulation time by reduced clearance and plasma protein absorption which can mitigate the metastasis between organs. “Their applications as drug delivery systems for cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs, small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids have shown promises to improve therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, they have intrinsic properties that mitigate traditional limitations to treatment modalities in breast cancer, including improved penetration to and accumulation in the tumour tissue. Limitation to current treatment modalities include rapid systemic clearance of anticancer drugs, toxicity to healthy organs, tumour chemoresistance and lack of selective targeted agents in certain types of breast cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer.”https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13346-021-00996-5"
The company position is better then last year and share still going down ! any idea?
European EMA approves Trogarzo without requiring any additional testing.
"The company has done a great job on the R&D front, completing two protocols and submission of programs to the agency, got the letters may proceed for both programs and started the oncology trial as per schedule. This is a great achievement for a small company with limited resources.Their scientific team are very proactive and knowledgeable also historically they have a good track record getting drugs approved, Egrifta in North America and Trogarzo in the US and Europe.The market’s perception doesn’t reflect fully their achievements thus low volume/demand and undervaluation as a result.I believe one reasonable explanation is the low profile of the company and lack of convincing marketing of their R&D programs. I am a firm believer in today’s market when preclinical cancer companies are valued over US $1 B with no other programs or revenues, the company needs to address the valuation discrepancies by applying effective marketing especially targeting the retail investors which have been behind many other companies fairly/unfairly high valuation. The retail segment of the market has progressively increased in the last few years therefore many other companies big or small have allocated more resources to increase the awareness among those investors. I am certainly looking forward to seeing THTX applying same marketing strategies in the future as they are in the process to rebrand the company. To me this is the missing part of the story so far."

"They send all 6 cancer results so the FDA gave them the fast track designation as they had enough information to be given that designation based on only animal research which sounds like the agency liked their MOA.If show safety and efficacy in P1 cancer, the 2 and 3 will move a lot faster given unmet need.50 to 60 percent of patients who died of cancer had over expressed sortilin.$12 billion revenue for advanced stage cancer which can be much higher if they start treating early-stage cancers ! CEO answered my question.They will make announcement whenever they have data available to the whole world.Cash is $70 million.They will be adjusting the NASH protocol to approach both FDA and EMA.They are looking for new investors and work hard for excising shareholders( first time I heard anyone on company saying that)Sort1 technology has no competition, with IP protection."
Why it’s dropped today? No volume?
"Check out the new study results confirming Tesamorelin significantly reduces liver fat in HIV patients with NAFLD.

"Quick Summary Cantor:Paul mentioned their oncology platform “magic” has a very application, between now and the end of the year they will have the MTD and inform the market, they are currently dosing patients, they could potentially see early efficacy of a patient with high level of Sortilin. They are exploring a partnership for their oncology technology in China.On NASH they will definitely proceed with the program with or without a partner as they think they have strong data to “tip it over’ to an approval, he predicted an approval by 2026. They will eventually need to have a partner for the potential approved drug in order to commercialize it. He believes THTX is serious contender in the industry.On Egrifta he mentioned lipodystrophy is linked to NAFLD/MASH and as science has evolved physicians will understand the condition is not cosmetic therefore he projected “significant” sale growth for the drug.As for Trogarzo Paul mentioned the aging MDR patients after 40 years of ART will eventually develop resistance and the market is moving away from oral daily pills towards long acting drugs such as Trogarzo."
TH.TO reached a 52 Week low at 1.97
"Now we have the good news we were looking for. Analyst adjustments coming soon, and the stock should keep on moving up from here. It will take some time as THTX is still relatively unknown, but this thing is primed for takeoff. I'm looking for at least $15 this year."
Now is a take-over target. Go GILD.

"As the drug pricing reform has been discussed in the congress lately the pharma companies have been lobbying against it with a seven figure recently launched campaign. The article below does good analysis’s of what has to be considered for a fairly priced newly approved drug considering among others the cost of development. This article has been referenced to by pharma companies justifying their pricing. The trend has been moving towards value based pricing however the high prices of newly launched drugs have prompted calls for ‘cost-plus’ pricing approaches considering R&D costs. The fast track and orphan drug designation has been linked to reduced cost due to shortened trial time and fewer trial participants. They also say the cost estimates of an R&D project from preclinical to the end of post approval based on multiple articles can vary from $161 million to $4.54 billion however they believe as there are many factors involved it is somehow hard to predict the cost as during the process the sponsor might have to change the trial design or/and will be granted various favorable designations from agencies.The point is as there is a never ending debate about the drug pricing however there are many factors which have to be considered so the R&D companies have financial incentives to start lengthy and somehow hard to estimate costly projects. As for THTX going forward depending on results getting orphan drug, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval will be effecting the costs of their program positively. Their PDC if it shows promising results will be qualifying for those beneficial designations.“This From a health economics perspective, and one that endorses fair access to innovative value-added products, we believe that high R&D costs alone should not justify high medicine prices. Indeed, there is a trend towards a ‘value-based pricing’ model where R&D costs alone do not necessarily play a crucial role. However, the inherent risks of pharmaceutical R&D cannot be ignored, and the value-based pricing model must contend with the ‘if’ and ‘how’ successful medicines compensate drug failures.Our assessment uses criteria addressing three key domains: (1) how the drugs’ success rates and development time used for cost estimation were obtained; (2) if the study considered potential sources attributing to the variation in R&D costs; and (3) what the components of the cost estimation were?Some experts have challenged the estimations presented in the articles used in our analysis, in respect of how four variables impact the validity of existing and future estimates. The role of public investment: How much of the R&D costs come from public resources and not from private investments? (2) Post-authorization R&D costs: After the drug is approved by the corresponding regulator (e.g., FDA or European Medicines Agency [EMA]), how much R&D is still required to assure reimbursement and market success? (3) Disparities in regulations and length of time for approval across time. (4) Variations in the complexity of clinical trials (e.g., protocol design) across time. Although these variables do not have a main role in estimating the R&D costs of bringing a new NME to the market, they still warrant consideration. The first (the role in public investment) is not related to the R&D cost level but with the funding sources. The second (post-authorization R&D costs) captures the authors’ consideration of potential R&D costs occurring after market approval, which are particularly relevant for drugs approved in the earlier stages of development. The latter two are crucial if the aim is to analyze possible future trends in R&D costs. We systematically reviewed studies that estimated the (prelaunch) R&D cost per NME and examined how the studies addressed key factors that might influence the estimate. The main components of the R&D cost per NME are: (1) direct cash expenses; (2) the future value at the time of launch (and thus return on investment), which is to be adjusted to the high risk of development failure (i.e., success or attrition rates); and (3) the long development times resulting in substantial opportunity costs (i.e., COC). Results showed a wide range of R&D cost estimates, from $161 million to $4.54 billionSeveral factors affect the investment in R&D, and we selected the five factors most often mentioned in the literature: therapeutic class; orphan or non-orphan drugs; firm size; NCE or new biological entity (NBE); and self-originated or licensed-in (acknowledging it is not meant to be an exhaustive list).Despite the increase in the number of new orphan drugs approved and launched into the market, the methodologies used to estimate R&D costs mostly ignored possible differences between orphan and non-orphan drugs. Some studies suggest that R&D costs for orphan drugs might be about half of those for non-orphan medicines. This is partly explained by the fact that trials related to rare diseases include fewer participa"

"Few interesting things from CC:Sales of Egrifta SV increased significantly but Trogarzo’s sales still is under pressure due to Pandemic and competition having said that they finalized their pricing negotiations in Italy and within next two weeks will be finalizing the pricing in France and are expected to launch the drug in both countries by end of 2021.They are on schedule with the dose escalation for their PDC they had no DLT so far, patients that received 300mg/m2 (1.5 times the indicated dose of Docetaxel) had no grade 2 adverse events, the last patient who received 420mg/m2 of TH1902 had grade 4 neutropenia which equals grade 2 adverse effect but they will moving on with dose escalation until the MTD is determined. They have received interest from Chinese companies for the oncology program so early in the process.The NASH program will be going ahead with or without partner in 2022 also as mentioned earlier they have hired a US biopharma advisory firm assisting the company to find a suitable partner.They have over $51M which should cover their operational expenses for another year."

"Just read an article on Seeking Alpha about MDGL, one of the big contenders to also develop a drug that would compete with THERF. The upside to MDGL was ease of use from a pill versus injection. The author detailed a number of reasons why MDGL's Ph. 2 trial didn't provide the efficacy in two categories that are highly scrutinized in a Ph. 3. Stock has dropped, and the analyst isn't giving MDGL a very good chance of having a positive Ph. 3 result. This should make THERF that much more valuable, since it has a drug with amazing efficacy, that is already in production and being sold. Furthermore, MDGL has no sales or earnings where THERF is producing operating cash flow already. plus, even if MDGL had a successful result, it's years away from going to market. Yet, MDGL is valued at more than THERF. Just comparing the two, there is huge upside for THERF."
"New Corporate Presentation is upFor R&D looking through it quickly they added the fast track for PDC and study may proceed for both protocols.The commercializing strategies seems to have few new additions, note they are saying the Trogarzo market opportunity could be as much as US!“New Go-to-Market Strategy Underpinned by Sales Force Reorganization and Targeted Patient / Prescriber Education.Leverage existing localized KOL relationships to capture HIV market opportunities, which could scale to parity with the U.S.Targeted and frequent educational initiatives to key KOLs, patients and the HIV community.”"
This is starting to look interesting
Phase 3 for NASH coming soon! And a Phase 1 for the new cancer treatment next year.
"Wow! Just found out that Bloomberg provided an updated on ownership, and as of 5/31/19, the Oppenheimer International Small Mid Cap fund now owns 4 Million Therf shares. The fund manager has the #1 Global Small Cap record for the last decade."
TH.TO reached a 52 Week low at 4.40
"I see no reasons why this stock does not go back at $6-7$ by year end, where it should be. Agree that something’s cooking. So many good products in the pipeline, no surprise that FDA gave them fast track designation!"
"These are the 11 approved ADC’s also targeted drug delivery technology, I am going to bypass Mylotarg as the drug was approved first in 2000 but due to adverse effects it got black box warning later in 2010 it was withdrawn and in 2017 it was approved again and still has the warning.Note the market sizes quoted below are for the cancers mentioned and not for late stages of them but I think it would be good to include them as a references.Adcetris targeting Hodgkin lymphoma. The Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Therapeutics market in the U.S. is estimated at $1.6 Billion in the year 2020 and systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (rare condition with low prevalence), the drug is commercialized by Seattle Genetics (among others) now known as Seagen, approved in 2011.They sold in 2021 $344.5M, 2020 $658.6M, 2019 $627.7M, 2018 $476.9M, 2017 $307.6M etc. so the sales of the drug has a decent growth rate YOY. Adcetris Costs $4,500 Per Vial, or over $100,000 for a course of Lymphoma treatment.https://www.biochempeg.com/article/74.html Kadcyla approved in 2013 targeting HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer following treatment with trastuzumab and a maytansinoid. The therapeutic market in the US is estimated to be more than $4B the drug is commercialized by Roche, sales of the drug $631M in 2021 so far, 540$M IN 2020, $876M in 2019, 637$M in 2018 so sales are steady in the last few years. The recommended dose of KADCYLA is 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) and price is $3,451 per 100 mg.Besponsa approved in 2017 targeting relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, this condition seems to have low prevalence with about 876,000 people were globally affected in 2015, commercialized by Pfizer/Wyeth. Pfizer sold so far in the US only $42 M in 2021 and $36M in 2020 etc.Lumoxiti approved in 2018 targeting adults with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia. The hairy cell leukemia therapeutics market in the US is projected to be at$2.4B. AstraZeneca licensed the EU and US rights of Lumoxiti to Innate Pharma for $50 million upfront plus future milestone payments of up to $25 million, later on Innate Pharma returned US and EU Lumoxiti commercialization rights back to AstraZeneca.The cost for Lumoxiti intravenous powder for injection 1 mg is around $2,217 for a supply of 1 powder for injection, the dosage is 0.04 mg/kg IV on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28-day cycle; infuse over 30 minutes. Continue for maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Looking at half year results of AstraZeneca it seems like they gave the sale numbers of all their oncology drugs and not individual drugs so I don’t know the sales of the drug.Polivy approved in 2019 targeting relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The global relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma market is estimated to be valued at $ 1.3 B in 2021. Roche sold internationally in 2021 $94M ($40M in US), $169M in 2020, $51M in 2019 so again a healthy sale growth for their drug. The drug costs in the region of $90,000 for a four-month course.Padcev approved in 2019 targeting adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, and a Pt-containing therapy. The global metastatic urothelial carcinoma market was valued at $725.9M in 2019. Seattle Genetics now Seagen sold $152M in 2021, $222M in 2020.The annual cost of the drug estimated at $100,000.Enhertu approved in 2019 targeting adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.A new report from GlobalData UK indicates that the market for HER2-positive breast cancer treatments could grow from $6.4 billion in 2015 to $9.89 billion in 2025, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4%. Again AstraZeneca bundled up their oncology drugs’ sales so I cannot find sales numbers for this drug.The cost for Enhertu intravenous powder for injection 100 mg is around $2,479 for a supply of 1 powder for injection and the dosage is 5.4 mg/kg IV q3Weeks (21-day cycle)Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Trodelvy approved in 2020 targeting adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two prior therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic disease, the market value for TNBC in 2017 was about $440M. Immunomedics the founder of the drug in 2020, was acquired by Gilead Sciences. They sold $532M in 2021so far versus $49M in 2020 since the launch of the drug in 2020, impressive sale growth! The cost for Trodelvy intravenous powder for injection 180 mg is around $2,239 for a supply of 1 powder for injection as per dosage days 1 and 8: 10 mg/kg IV continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Blenrep approved in 2020 targeting adult patients with relapsed"
Trying to load up with as much as I can before a big announcement ! It’s coming
"I am holding 35K shares. Their TH1902 technology is very much potential, buy THTX at this price is high reward and low risk as long as we need to be patient. In addition, THTX has NASH trial which is going to be conducted in Q3. I am also hoping that the sales of Trogarzo and Egrifta can have substantial increase since pandemic is no longer an issue/excuse."
"My take is absent any speculations when one run a business regardless whether the business is selling the value of its tangible/ intangible assets it has to make sure all of it is understood and valued by the buyers. The golden rule in investing is diversification that rule does also apply to businesses offering various goods, services and ideas, point is the business has to make sure all their operations with potentials of bringing in revenues are run efficiently some less lucrative but more reliable and vice versa. For instance back in the day when I was practicing I had a less lucrative contract with NHS taking care of X amount of patients for a set fee which was ongoing and reliable. At times due to lack of time taking care of much more lucrative private patients it didn’t seemed feasible to keep that contract going but the private segment was not reliable so for instance during subprime crisis that sector got hit and the NHS contract came very handy, what I am trying to say is a contingency plan should be part of the overall plan in the business.THTX has two main assets the commercial part and the R&D part. The commercial part is the reliable but potentially less lucrative part if and when the R&D programs are successful they will be the main breadwinners but they are not there yet, now why early in the process would/should they give up on that part? On the contrary that is the part they have most control of also due to better marketing and the launch of better administration methods of the drugs (Trogarzo IV push/IM and F8) they can bring in increasing revenues regardless of what other operations they are involved in or how successful those operation are. Those revenues can partially fund the R&D programs also as there are some incomings future fund rising will be needed later and will be lesser.As per oncology it has great prospects and some 5 months into process it seems it is progressing well but it is far early to light the Cohiba cigar therefore the company cannot and should not make any strategic decisions based on that asset. NASH programs have not being successful after more than a decade of research so far and recently due to NGM’s phase 2b Alpine study’s failure the space is now out of favor among investors, but that doesn’t change the fact the condition is still unmet, epidemic with great financial prospects for more than one approved drug. As a reminder their science is based on Tesamorelin’s targeted proteomic, transcriptomic approach, organic approach which works upstream by stimulating the pituitary glands to produce normal timed secretion of growth hormone which directly reduces visceral fat, decreases lipogenesis, decreases triglyceride accumulation, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation, improves mitochondrial function and indirectly GH stimulates endogenous production of IGF-1 in the liver resulting in decreases insulin resistance, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation, deactivates hepatic stellate cells (liver cells that contribute to fibrosis) , also no overstimulation of GH like thyroid approach and list goes on.. “The totality of data”. So although they don’t have many F2/F3 biopsy confirmed patients their innovative and different approach could be the potential cure for this condition which has caused great humanitarian and economic burden globally. Point is in my opinion they should work hard to increase the sales (reliable, relatively controllable even so less lucrative compared to original estimates), make sure the oncology trial is running smoothly and at its best potentials(pushing CROs to have patients enrolled in time, on the back of potential good results expand it as planned to more cancers and approach EMA for an IND for the protocol etc.), last but not least bring their NASH program to spotlights so both investors and potential partners understand the embodied value of it, based on the outcome of their efforts make the right strategic decision related to NASH, if they get some bites then bring that partner onboard which can either fund the trial or/and add expertise(that also add credibility to the program and the whole company, de-risk the program but they will have to give up some part of the potential future revenues if and when the drug gets approved), run the futility trial alone then bring the partner onboard or move on from there by themselves etc., dropping it outright isn’t it in my opinion. I just want to also touch base on the economics of trials as per some they cost $100M, $150M and I am not sure what those estimates are based on looking at available information on the net a trial based on the condition it is targeting and duration of it among others can cost anything between $30k to $60k per patient to put it in perspective the suggested futility trial enrolling 400 patients for the duration of 18 months could cost anything between $12M to $24M and the proposed phase3 trial with 1100 patients enrolled could cost some $33M to $66M also all"
"They are studying the roll of Tesamorelin in PLWH with cognitive impairment. The study starts in 2022 lasting 6 months. I recall they looked into that many years ago but probably due to limited resources it was stopped.One possible reason for the condition is low CD4 counts. https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/cognitive-impairment-dementia-and-hiv “Of 5,588 records identified, we included 123 studies involving 35,513 participants from 32 countries. The overall prevalence of HAND was 42.6%…” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32887786/ So there is market opportunity for commercializing the drug for a sizeable market."
"Quick summary of the fireside chat today.On oncology program:FDA was compelled by the data thus they got before start of the trial the fast track designation.The institutional investors who participated in the offering were very impressed by their oncology program.They could get safety results during summer this year and soon after some efficacy result and will be sharing that information with the market.Ed Nash will be focusing on the oncology program going forward as the data will be released.Paul sounded very optimistic about the progress of the program which was started ahead of the schedule.On Phase 3 NASH:The KOLs didn’t believe there will be a need to have a phase2b as the data they have justifies to start the phase3.They agencies have approved the switch from administration by syringes to pen injector and the vast majority of patients will be dosed with the pen injector as the trial progresses.They believe based on the fact that Tesamorelin reduced liver fat by more than 30 percent in 60 percent of patients and the recent study conducted by Dr, Loomba confirmed a reduction of 30 percent of liver fat will also result in regression of fibrosis they feel very confident that the drug will decrease the fibrosis.It sounded they already had the meeting with FDA and will now present it to the EMA before finalizing it as they might need to make adjustments to satisfy both agencies nevertheless they don’t anticipate any issues with both agencies and start the trial by end of third quarter(September) this year.Paul mentioned they might not be first to have a drug approved for NASH but they could have the best drug for the condition.On the financing and partnership:They have enough money for 2021 and 2022 but they might not want to wait until they almost run out of funds and there are many routes to raise funds one would be a suitable partner such as Pfizer or Lilly.They can cover the center of excellent in liver therapy but are happy to partner with other pharmas to gain the sale force necessary to commercialize the drug to 3 to 5 percent of US population suffering with NASH if and when it gets approved.They are for now concentrated to dose patients first before a potential partnership agreement.On Trogarzo drugs:They want to educate doctors not to wait too long until the viral loads are too high and it is too late therefore they should start the patients on the drug sooner rather later.The IV push will be launched soon.They have a medical group who are actively educating doctors in Europe. They anticipate a rebound in sales as economies are gradually opening up.On Egrifta:They need to educate the aging PLWH that lipodystrophy will be messing up their health and aging process.The F8 will be boosting the sales as it is far more patient friendly.The two new recruits are highly experienced and will be boosting the sales of both drugs.On valuation:They know they did make some mistakes in the past and will not repeat those mistakes.They want to create market awareness of their operations specially the R&D programs so investors buy their shares and have a plan to do exactly that."
"Today's press release finally confirms NASH data release timeline, Nasdaq listing and what the company view is for Trogarzo sales. Hopefully word starts to get out soon."
"From the transcript.On collaborations(they touch base on that later during questions from analysts too):We are also looking at additional opportunities and regulatory commercial installed for TH1902 in other geographies. Currently, we are exploring potential cooperating and alliances with China based organization to evaluate TH1902 in patients in Greater China that are suffering from sortilin-expressing cancers.08:11 By gaining the support, and scientific expertise of the locally based organization to help us develop TH1902 we are better positioning ourselves to bring this potential treatment to patients faster and more effectively, which is at the foundation of our oncology strategy.The event provided a deep dive into our innovative approach to treating NASH [indiscernible] and also demonstrated the distinct support this program has from these leading disease and industry experts. We look forward to updating you on the advancement of our NASH program soon.On sales:Since then, we have challenged the fundamentals of our business, developing a mature business acumen, which includes a more focused field force. And digitalize training and product education tools and have ultimately created a solid go to market model.As a result, sales increased nearly thirty percent in the third quarter over twenty twenty one over last year supported by sixty five increase in EGRIFTA SV sales. The improvement in EGRIFTA SV sales is a direct result of a returning to some face-to-face meetings and greater and more efficient digital campaigning and [indiscernible] patient, which also led to a forty percent increase in new prescribers during the quarter.The mode of convenient IV Push mode administration [indiscernible] two good infusions from offering patients or rapid infusion time, thereby potentially increasing patient applicant, and allowing patients to benefit from long-acting protection against HIV-1 when Trogarzo is administered with other antiretrovirals.Specific to our progress in the Italian market, our technologies and Italian medicines agency recently reached a reimbursement agreement with Trogarzo, and we expect that this medicine will become commercially available to all eligible patients in Italy by the end of fiscal year twenty twenty one.On oncology and NASH:we are extremely pleased and encouraged by the early indication that the Phase 1 Part A study in TH1902 have demonstrated and look forward to both interim and full data results in this program over the next several quarters.Well as Paul mentioned on the NASH program, the outreach is continuing and we have had some discussions with potential partners, but there's no real update at this point. On the oncology, we've had some, we hired the advisors well for Greater China. We have received some inbound interest from Chinese companies and we decided to go out much broader than just dealing with one or two. And so, we've initiated a process, a formal process. There's quite a bit of interest in China for the oncology platform.Again, very early to report any anything substantial, but we’re frankly pretty encouraged with the interest that we've seen. On the in-licensing side, it's a little less active although we have been approached with some very interesting earlier stage projects. So, we're not quite ready to discuss that. But there is, you know, one of the plans that we have is to act as a catalyst for research that is being done here in Quebec in addition to in-licensing other technologies.Note they have so far dosed one patient at a time something I have tried to point out several times.we've been enrolling patients one by one. And as we move deeper in the Phase 1 we be rolling three by three and when the expansion trial comes in, it's forty patients so next year, there should be to ramp up on the oncology program.On dosing and MTD:Yes, absolutely, well, this is – we're not there yet with the MTD. The way it works as even like what we need, you see is what we call a dose [indiscernible] toxicity. And what we have seen so far is a neutropenia without fever, therefore it is not yet a DLT and once we reach and like a great to adverse events, we need to enroll more patient at that dose level. And once we have to treat a total of three patients treated at that dose level, we decide if we can continue to increase or if we remain at the same dose or if we have to lower the dose.35:29 Then what I can say about this Phase 1 trial at the moment, if this really what we have what we were expecting from the animal data that we had. And we are now at those levels that are in the range of about 2x docetaxel. We have dose patients at three hundred with that rate to adverse event, which means that we can administer up to one point five times the dose of docetaxel when conjugated with on TH1902, without having any adverse events.Then we're getting close to the MTD. That's the dose that we're expecting based on the animal model, we need two more patients to"

"New weapon against refractory cancersQuebec biotech Theratechnologies has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin Phase 1 clinical trials on TH1902, an anti-cancer drug developed from a therapeutic platform developed by Professor Borhane Annabi of the Department of Chemistry and his team at UQAM's Molecular Oncology Laboratory. Trials will begin in the coming months in patients with advanced endometrial, ovarian, colon, pancreatic and triple negative breast cancers that are resistant to available treatments. ""It's amazing to have been involved in the development of a new drug from A to Z, from the early stages of research to early clinical trials,"" says Borhane Annabi. We are very proud, especially since the FDA has just granted us the""fast track""designation, which means that our file has passed at the top of the pile. This has a lot of weight and will help in patient recruitment."" The""fast track""designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review process of drugs designed for the treatment of serious medical conditions and to allow patients to access new drugs more quickly, Theratechnologies said in a statement issued on February 4. This FDA recognition of TH1902 highlights ""the vast field of applicability and enormous medical need for innovative, targeted, potentially more effective and better tolerated treatments for cancer,"" said Dr. Christian Marsolais, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Theratechnologies. TH1902 combines docetaxel, a drug already part of the cancer therapeutic arsenal, and a peptide that specifically targets sortilin receptors (SORT1). This new drug vectoring platform is based on inventions by Borhane Annabi's team, developed at UQAM in collaboration with Professor Emeritus Richard Bliveau. The technology specifically targets overexpressed proteins on cancer cells, the sortilin receptors, which serve as a gateway to bring the drug inside these cells. Several types of cancers express the sortilin receptor (SORT1). Promising preclinical results have already been obtained for triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and, more recently, colon, pancreatic, endometrial and skin cancers. The preclinical assessment of TH1902 is still ongoing for melanoma. ""In animals, treatment has been shown to slow down tumor growth, or even completely eradicat, without causing weight loss or neutropenia, deleterious side effects often associated with chemotherapy,"" says Borhane Annabi. Now it's all about clinical trials."" The first Phase 1 trial in humans will assess, among other things, the safety of the drug and the maximum tolerated dose. TH1902 will be administered once every three weeks to patients at the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, one of the largest cancer treatment and research centers in the United States. Patients (in many cases, patients) with advanced and recurrent solid tumors expressing the sortilin receptor and resistant to standard treatments will be able to participate in the study. ""These are patients who can no longer be treated, who no longer respond or very little to current treatments,"" says Borhane Annabi. For those people to whom medicine no longer has much to offer, the trials that are about to begin are a great hope."" The Canadian Cancer Society (CCS) and the Quebec government, through the Quebec Consortium on Drug Discovery (CQDM), will contribute a total of $1.4 million to support ongoing research. ""This is a great partnership between cutting-edge biomedical research and industry, between UQAM and its partners Theratechnologies, CCS and CQDM, who believed in the project and funded it,"" concludes Borhane Annabi. We hope to be laying the groundwork for a possible success story.""https://www.actualites.uqam.ca/2021/nouvelle-arme-contre-des-cancers-refractaires-aux-traitements-conventionnels"
"Trogarzo is cost effectiveThe company seems to be more proactive, this was published initially on PharmacoEconomics and republished on Springer. (academic access only).Ibalizumab cost effective for multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection in USA?PharmacoEconomics & Outcomes News volume 872, page17(2021)Cite this article Metricsdetails Ibalizumab may be cost effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection in the US, according to findings of a Theratechnologies-funded study published in PharmacoEconomics. A Markov model populated with data from phase II and III trials and market uptake projections was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of final-line antiretroviral therapy with ibalizumab plus optimised background therapy (OBT) versus OBT alone in adults with MDR HIV-1, from a US healthcare sector perspective over a lifetime time horizon. Budget impact analysis was also performed to estimate the impact of the introduction of add-on ibalizumab on the payer budget of a hypothetical commercial health plan during the first 3 years, and from a Medicare health plan perspective. The assumed cost of ibalizumab was $125 555Footnote1 in the first year and $118 445 per year thereafter, and the assumed annual cost of OBT was $52 850. It was estimated that ibalizumab plus OBT would increase survival by 1.47 years compared with OBT alone, achieving an incremental gain of 1.45 QALYs at an incremental cost of $192 476, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $133 040 per QALY gained. In a commercial health plan with 1 million members, the addition of ibalizumab to OBT was estimated to increase the budget by $217 260 ($0.018 per member per month [PMPM]) in year 1, $385 245 ($0.032 PMPM) in year 2 and $560 310 ($0.47 PMPM) in year 3. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that ibalizumab plus OBT was cost effective versus OBT alone in 73.4% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY gained. In budget-impact scenario analysis, the budget impact of ibalizumab was found to be greater in a Medicare population ($0.054 PMPM in year 3) but, under all scenarios evaluated, the annual budget impact was less than $0.07 PMPM. ""This analysis suggests that ibalizumab treatment may be cost-effective considering willingness-to-pay thresholds for rare diseases and that including ibalizumab on either a commercial or a Medicare health plan formulary may result in a relatively low budget impact,"" concluded the authors."

"Interesting reaction today to what must have been the written interview of our CEO, Paul, that was released. Not sure why people took it for sell worthy news. It is true, they'll need more cash, but the company will be in a very different position by the time those additional dollars are necessary. And there are other financing options available in that case."
This is incredibly painful to watch. I can't wait until next month. The analyst aren't talking about NASH yet.
