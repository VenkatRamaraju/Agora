"The turn is in place, streamlined cost structure, exiting low margin-continued loses in China. Half of the market in cash, no debt, huge NOL. Commercializing waste water technology...Multi-bagger potential"
this stock is giving wild moves today.
All I ask is pass the resistance mark
"From the 2018 year end statementMr. Arnone concluded, “We have successfully emerged from executing on a multi-year program of cost reduction and rationalization initiatives. The completion of the suspension of our China operation in 2019 will enable improved profitability for the Company as a whole, and for full year 2019 we expect to generate both income from continuing operations and positive cash flow for the second consecutive year. Further business development for our APC and FUEL CHEM business segments remains as priority. We are currently pursuing a pipeline of opportunities with an aggregate value of greater than $100 million that covers all fuel sources, involves the application of the entirety of our product line and serves customers in multiple geographies. We are also looking forward to our first commercial efforts in water treatment.”"
Bought at 2.09....need to see an increase in volume or I’m out
6$ by Wednesday
What’s the chance it goes back up I am in at $1.22
Only 24 million shares outstanding and 28% insider ownership. Don't let the shorts scare the Gekk out of ya!
"''Net income from continuing operations was $2.4 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to net loss fromcontinuing operations of $(1.3) million, or $(0.05) per share, primarily due to the impact of theaforementioned settlement in Q3 2020.''"
"Coal is coming back because oil's problem and renewable energy not catching up fast enough , solar and wind is not reliable one example what happened to Texas, you heard it here first, I am buying $FTEK all I can"
Now is the time to BUY. Right now at 1.06
Look at 1 year chart this is only a spike and plenty of heavy bags next week
"The real question waiting to be answered is, what impact will Fuel Techs first Water cleaning contract have on the stock price ?"
"Not a surprise, if one understands the power of Accounting and Taxation and truly followed the years of 1x charges, global restructuring and FTEK's end markets, one could see the turn coming. A pullback yes would be healthy, but if one understands cost accounting and the current leverage of FTEK's model, their is significant value even at this current price. Commercialization of the waste water endeavor may bring FTEK to double digits."
"Fidelity and the Vanguard Group are just a few of the 49 Holders of FTEKThat info help me to decide to invest in FTEK, glad I did !"
Huge mistake buying this stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC9sV-Zg2I
Should have shorted at 2
quarterly gain was due to insurance payment after previously was previously an expense . otherwise it would have continued it's losses . after analyzing the numbers this accounting /financial guy isn't investing here - for now
what a great trading stock. nice swings in price giving good entry and exit points. low float as well.
$2 easily today!!
Come on we can get $2
"Looks like FTEK is nearing the end of a 3-month long consolidation triangle following its gains last November. Should be starting to bounce back up towards its resistance (around 6.70) this week. Think it can break that? If it can, we could be looking at another significant move, as there is literally no resistance level above the 6.7-7.00 range."
"this company is shaping up really well, beat quarter expectations and the stock yet to be discovered. Give it 2 months and we're at 3-4 USD"
"WELL, 3$++ TOMORROW!!"
Should I sell or hold? I purchased today at the price $6.81/share and already lost lots of money. i will appreciate your response.
Such a happy board. I think we continue to rise based on earnings!!!
What's the driver for FTEK? Can't find news. Over $5 after hours.
Yikes!! that was fast...$4.81 to 4.45.. someone dumped 1million shares & someone bought those shares!
it has nothing to do with scam or not but with volume.
"Does it seem that the second side of the cup, seen as part of the bullish cup with handle continuation pattern, might be forming with potential for a break out at $1.42?"
$3 soon and $2 after that
"going to make a 4 year run in my book, going along with FCEL"

"Fuel Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: FTEK), a technology company providing advanced engineering solutions for the optimization of combustion systems, emissions control and water treatment in utility and industrial applications, today announced two FUEL CHEM demonstration orders using the Company’s proprietary TIFI Bio (Targeted In-Furnace Injection) technology."
Is this stock just going to keep dropping?
"The good the bad and the not so ugly. We all know in a spaghetti western the good guy wins in the end after a formidable battle with tenacious bandits. The Q1 -19 C.C. adds one more chapter into the FTEK saga. Lets look at some of the details from the call in a good, bad, and not so ugly order. On cue and action. Adding 2 new incremental domestic units to be completed by the end of Q2. Costs associated with the Beijing closure(0.9mil). Potential contracts valued at nominally 12.5 mil.. Scene 2. SG&A declining .5 mil. Unplanned customer outages in Q1 for fuel chem. Project backlog =Q1-18. BREF compliance date nearing. Turkey goodbye. Hello German dance partner . This is only about half way thru the opening statement. Hopefully its sparks your interest in reading the full Q1 2019 C.C. (N)eed (T)o (P)repare (C)autiously. Iceberg spotted near West Bengal ."
Buying at this support looks safe ..
Please tell me this stock is not a turkey

Can we see this stock jump past 8 anytime soon ?

Spiking now!
Who's long this stock & why?
"Fidelity ETF loading FTEK shares in Jan30,2021 check it out"
Going into the $9's hang in there.
"Something is brewing, stock is up sharply this morning. Does anyone know ???"
Not a single person knows where this will end today
Will be down 15-20% tomorrow
APC orders needed . It has been a real dry spell. Calm before the storm ???? Waiting any information on DGI .
"This board is pretty dead for better or worse. But, I believe FTEK will beat earnings and the company is being undervalued at current share price. Stating it now for the record."
$4.25 jump back in...
This will be below $1 soon enough. Momo traders are gone. No near term catalyst to drive this higher. Selling will continue and this will bleed slowly below a buck. Get out people. Nothing but bagholders holding this now.
"Nice to see, especially in FTEK's highest margin division"
"Nice push by shorty, but it won't last. This is going to grind higher, much higher."
"Finally some news from this company....Congratulations Fuel Tech for acquiring these contracts, awesome job."
Does FTEK announce orders as they are received or do they do so at pre-determined intervals?
"This week Fuel tech will be attending this conference. Valmt Circulating and Bubbling Fluidized Bed Boiler User Group (FBUG) August 27-29, 2018 Cedar Rapids, IA. This is related to the pulp n paper industry. Check their website for details."

I'am confident the Fuel Tech team will bring their 'A' game. Networking = higher revenues."
"I bought 5k yesterday, lets gooo!"
"this needs any kind of good news, volume is way too low"
Intra-day cup n handle.. you better cover shorties!!
The fact that no one is buying AH’s is not a good sign. Below $1 very likely.
i keep this tock for a long timee it has a low floth of shares and is profitable
Does anyone see this stock going over 7?
"Block of 124,833 shares @ 1.24 goes off! Starting to see the rotation..."
FTEK is on fire. IT's burning cash. They will burn thru this $25 million just like the last large cash position they held. Check out their history.
"We expect the demand for SNCR systems to pick up in 2019 as technology demonstrations are concluded at NTPC plants..... From the latest C.C. . Who is NTPC ??? NTPC Limited = India’s largest energy conglomerate .FTEK has multiple demonstrations with NTPC. There it is, spelled out in Hindu for you."
Who would sell a $8 stock for $1.98?
CRASH DOWN TO 1.90!!!!
it should going up $6 soon
"Some call it clean coal, others call it Midwest jobs."
"Here is the work scheduled for delivery in the first quarter 0f 2019. Two SNCR's, one for a utility coal-fired boiler and the other on an industrial unit burning hazardous waste. Both of these units are in China. NOX Reduction by the best . For domestic pollution devices there is an ULTRA on a gas unit supplying combined heat and power at a college campus. Good job FTEK in providing a safe and effective system. Rounding the plate to home we have an ULTRA system with SCR technology. It will be on a gas unit in the west. Four units is not the strongest quarter. However the NOX reduction these units have will carry forward. Fuel chem revenues appear healthy. Awaiting the conference call more than the initial top and bottom lines."
"Here is the work scheduled for delivery in Q418. First up is an order from Europe, it is for new aqueous ammonia feed systems replacing SCR technology. This is a turnkey project. Second there a project in the U.S. on a gas fired utility unit which will utilize Fuel Tech’s UDI technology. The next project for delivery is not only a whooper but an opportunity for new market applications. This is the first order on a domestic data center and its ancillary systems.The scope includes Fuel Tech’s SCR and UDI Urea Direct systems. Fuel chem should hold its own. Patiently awaiting contract announcements in early Q119."
"I would love to know the ""investors"" who bought the Private Placement at. $5.16 a share s I have a Bridge in Brooklyn I would like ti sell to them."
FTEK upgraded by Research Team on 11/14 to Hold from Reduce.

I'm buying this when market openslooks amazing
"Turn Seems to be in place. Company has had to completely restructure themselves over the last 4 years, due to the fall out of Coal. Fuel Tech has transitioned away from coal to natural gas and other energy generation alternatives. While bookings came in after 2Q, they seems to be running over 1x, mgt voiced larger potential in 4Q. - Pulled ~32% out of SG&A expenses. -Cleaner coal would be a positive for FTEK. Trading below book, with 0.43 cash/shr I see limited down side and the potential for FTEK to earn $0.15 in 2019. 3Q18 should be the turning point."

"Imagine holding shares of this for the past few years and losing money and then one day BOOM, 200% gain in the span of 1 month. Yea, I think I’d be selling "
Why is this plunging so dramatically? They are expanding and new administration will be supporting companies like this.
FTEK reached a 52 Week low at 0.79
"Boom. Out at $1.48 from $1.36 for 22,000 shares. $2,640 profit in 20 minutes. Thank you very much."
Just about to reach green and people start selling. Dont even mke sense lol
"what will happen to this one today, guys what is your opinion?"

Are there any chance for this to go up? or best to sell?
"Zack's was sure pumping this before earnings. Since the crash, Zack's is looking more like a pump n dump operation."

"£2 is gonna be the best price you will regret not buying more at. Buy, buy, buy"
Let’s go guys. $cei is 350m market cap. $ftek is only 50m. Can see $14 price on this.
The green new deal will be the catalyst $FTEK needs to push it over $50 a share.
"Sorry, I meant $5.00 per share absent any new developments. They already stated on the conference call that they are circling around some major contracts so the news around those should provide some catalysts."
"Fuel Tech (FTEK)'s turnaround has been proven. The balance sheet looks great and revenue/profitability is increasing. Once the Chinese unit is completely removed from the books, that's an additional +$2 million profitability or +0.08 EPS/year (for a total of possibly 0.24 EPS/yr?). This stock should be trading above $3 based on these numbers. With $18 million in cash and no debt, the risk vs. reward ratio here is excellent."
Well its official now. Not a pump and dump since its almost back to where it was.
So what do we believe tomorrow will look like?
tomorrow premarket $3+
I bought this thing at 60 cents and rode it to 6 bucks. That was the surge. You missed it! It eventually went as high as 7 or so. The only way this stock moves to 10 is on the backs of gamblers and speculators.

Bought some for fun..let gamble a little
nice little pre-market purchase @$4.40
Party over.. Time to sell. 20% correction tomorrow.
The offering is private which should not dilute the shares.
I think this is about future earnings not about the present business condition the new president talking about rejoining paris agreement it about where things will be going CLIR and CECE pollution control companies also have seen heavy volume lately good luck

whats happening here??Any news guys?
sell or not??!!
any long here?! this stock seems to do very well in the next few months... these new contracts and considerable backlog could send this way higher ... waiting to see the 4th Q report
Q418 Looking for 13.5 mil in revenue and EPS of + .02. The work scheduled for delivery is a few post below.
can we hit $3 before earnings?
"This recent order announcement has strength in a multitude of manners. Growth in developing sectors, specifically on data centers and their ancillary systems. Maintaining a presence in Fuel Techs existing portfolio with the 2 ultra systems in china. The ultra system at a college campus I believe is a compact ultra unit similar to the one in Texas. The revenues are spread out over 3 quarters. The 2 units in china are slatted to be delivered in Q3 2018 which already looks healthy. Now looks bloated :). 22.5 million in orders so far in 2018. One thing I would really like to focus in on is, the amount of presentations and conferences that Fuel Tech has been involved in and will be at in 2018. Especially The International Water Conference in Scottsdale, AZ on November 4-8, 2018. Networking is the key to business growth. FTEK is pounding the pavement."
Will volume pick back up?
in @ 4.69 :) GLTA
$2? Soon?
"Hi guys, are we expecting good earning report?"
Any longs here? Whats our TP? getting some advice from fellow longs. Thank you
Awarded 4.5 mil contract. Better than nothing.
FTEK should consider introducing strategic investment institutions or merging into larger companies in order to acquire more customers and increase profits.
"Please answer my question, I am loosing money, I bought at 6.40 and now it is falling"
Fuel Tech is initiated as a buy with a target of $2.00/Share by H.C. Wainwright.
Anonymous have a Bridge in Brooklyn to sell ha ha ha
Ouch. Back to the $1's: Fuel Tech (NASDAQ:FTEK) reported quarterly losses of $(0.05) per share. This is a 400 percent decrease over losses of $(0.01) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $10.155 million which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $13.74 million by 26.09 percent. This is a 20.61 percent decrease over sales of $12.791 million the same period last year.
"Only 2 stocks are 100% up today. This is one. Guess what, it is getting shorted. JJ will never return back."
"Fantastic rotation, Once Fuel Tech starts to announce orders, with their restructured lean cost structure results will follow down to NI. Mgt is starting to get out there and voice their strategy to the institutions...Perfect for long term capital gains..."
"Told you it was going under $1, next comes 80 cents"
I would be very surprised if this isn't back below one dollar by next week. Or sooner.
Let's GO!! $10 PT
Ftek is basing now. Expecting a run in 1-2 weeks. Added today 50%. Will conserve some money if it drops under $2 to add the rest.
Is the market cap of this really 135 Mill ? like yahoo and TDAmeritrade are saying ?Looks like this is trying a breakout.According to my calculations this can climb to 7.00 on the next breakout.
"It i8s said that Fuel Tech's FUEL CHEM segment results reflected contributions from the installation of our TIFI Targeted In-Furnace Injection technology on three new domestic coal-fired units for a repeat customer in the Northeast.

"Keep in mind we will see $40 per share of $CBAT in the next couple of months.KNDI will go up to $40~50 level with the enhanced battery mileage.CBAT’s Tabless Battery will benefit Kandi’s battery swapping services (China Battery Exchange Technology ) and Kandi itself. For example, K23 with 41.4 kWh at 111 miles (179 km) will be upgraded to 60~70kWh 166 miles(267km) or even further. Then, Kandi will have the comparative advantage over the other EVs with less cost, decent mileage. The swapping service will get less cost of CBAT’s Tabless battery with better energy density, and higher capacity. If you are the EV investors buy CBAT & KNDI ASAP, you need to buy $CBAT, KNDI as of early next week.

Been bouncing around between 6 and 4 since 1030 yesterday. There was never a dump at all just profit taking with a sprinkle of panic selling lol
This is the time of the year when many indices and ETFs rebalance. There are many dealers who anticipate these rebalances and start buying potential stocks prior to the rebalancing dates. And they end up holding these stocks until the end of the rebalancing day and dump it when desperate ETFs managers try to achieve compliance. usually the stock price corrects itself the day of like in the case of TSLA and AYRO. my guess is most fund managers did their homework on this stock and achieved compliance to their respective indices before end of trading day or the correction came a bit late which explains the after hours surge.
FOMO is going to push this higher in the last 30 minutes of trading. Nobody will want to miss the AH push.

Judging by Chinese regulatory rule, they will adopt “replaceable battery pack” the same as those used by NIO. KNDI’s vehicle mileage will improve further along. The 32140 Tabless battery could benefit potentially many EV manufacturers as well as KNDI because capacity of 8GWh could cover more than 160,000 vehicles.

I almost choked when I saw today's price. I bought this a week ago ( cheap) and now thinking about selling some for my profits.
Looks like earning reports posted on Google
"If I understood the CC, FTEK said their flue gas conditioning technology ""might"" meet the Indian Government's particulate reduction emission standards for power plants. If FTEK's tech reduces emission particulates to the regulatory standards, it seems they would be an advantaged, low-cost provider in a potentially large market. Is mine a correct understanding and if so, when will FTEK know if they can fulfill India's regulatory standards and begin bidding for projects?"
"Joe is the man follow him and see how good he is. I have been trading his ideas, he's a smart trader."
Nice consolidation above one dollar. Next leg up will be pretty good the day the market as a whole goes green.

"Valuation is based on the future, Charles. Everything on your desk/message board is the past."
Just joined the future company
I repented and went in at 5.26 just now... Bless my judgment!!!
i took a risk and bought even more at open to average down a bit. very good decision
"These are extraordinary times indeed. A pandemic not seen since the 1918 virus that resulted in more than two million deaths world wide. In the more than 50 years I have been trading stocks (31 years as a Morgan Stanley broker) , I have seen many bubbles all that ended with a burst. The current Hydrogen / EV bubble is the biggest of all. Incredible how a #$%$ company like FTEK can attract $ to drive straight up recently. FCEL and PLUG also . Robinhood players among others are cruisin' for a bruisin"" JMO"
Me after buying this
the Harris administration socialist party are going to the new green deal and climate change reform..this and fcel fit right in
How is this going to affect the stock price. Private offering versus public or is there really a difference.
10 bucks soon
Clean energy is a must...with crude sky rocketing I can see all of these little clean energy stocks moving higher.
This will correct on Monday morning. I had 4 stocks that all moved around a dollar during the last 2 minutes of trading. It was due to rebalancing of index funds.
lets break 2$ resistance!
"Love the continuing restructuring, China has been a drain on Fuel Tech for years, I applaud management. The underlying margins in China are the lowest in FTEK's portfolio and can't support current operations there. Redeploy resources to more promising venues. Exciting times as FTEK reemerges, patience will be materially rewarded."
"If the company’s operators cannot reflect the company’s reasonable prices, they should merge with powerful business owners to fulfill their promises to investors."
"They didn't really beat Quarterly expectations, the earnings are not from sales but a one time Insurance payment! ""As previously announced, Fuel Tech reached a settlement with its insurance carrier (""the settlement"") that resulted in the Company receiving $2.6 million in proceeds related to an outstanding claim that was previously reported in 2019. Net income from continuing operations was $2.4 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $(1.3) million, or $(0.05) per share, primarily due to the impact of the aforementioned settlement in Q3 2020."""
Ftek is only worth the cash in the Company which is deteriorating on a daily basis. They lose money and the new contracts are meaningless for a Company this size. Coal is not making a comeback and there is no such thing as clean coal.
started a position today @ 2.74.....hope this works out....
Did you ever hear about (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just covered FTEK this AM
I really have belief in this company but the stock price! AWWWWW I bought at the high around $7. sigh. anyone else believe it will return to $7 again in my life time or 20 years?
After earnings %300 be ready 
watch for EOD plow to $2.25
FTEK and GEVO are already starting to blow up because of the new administration  green energy and limited emissions ftw 
"Decided to jon the party 15,000@1.86 looks like a solid company. Bottom is in. Enough cash. Backlog with orders. Strong buy on Zacks. Looks promising!"
ftek will surge $10_12
Is this going up anytime soon?
Can anyone shed some light on the water technology they have? Seems very interesting. How big of a deal is it. is it for drinking water or mainly treatment of contamination...?
This will pass 6.25 in about two hours. mark my words
"FTEK upgraded on Nov 14 by ""The Street Ratings"" from a Sell (D) to a Hold (C). Excerpt: ""The company's strengths canbe seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonabledebt levels by most measures and solid stock price performance. However, as a counter to these strengths,we find that the company's profit margins have been poor overall."""
Where the options. I want to buy puts of it opens above $5 tomorrow lol
I am about to buy 1.8 million shares of this. You all are welcome
"Just went over their last earnings call, very impressive. The trend is higher."
Many deals are in the making here. This could pop to 10-14 dollars easily before Turkey Day.
"First of all the ticker symbol is kind of rude ''F TEK'' as in ''F tech''?Secondly: the 0,10 USD EPS per share; is it a one time or structural thing?Anyone with deep insight in FTEK?"
Bullish of course
"I held this stock 12 years ago, sold and I notice now that even with a Democratic Administration it can not gain any traction. The top three executives make a collective $1 million in salaries for what? Braying about growth?"
This is still tremendously undervalued. Market cap should easily climb to 400mil-500mil very soon. Thanks for all the cheap shares.
"The stock goes into the $9's, dont listen to the nay sayers.. We will always need coal..always! The difference is clean energy...Rockefeller & Carnegie.."
"Just to give everyone a background on the company. They are a company that help to reduce air pollution from all type of industrial operation. They will benefit from The world’s new pollution strategy, especially China where they have growing client."
"going back to 1.50 by mid-august. all china debts resolved. will be plus .02 for four cent earnings beat, also caused by carryover contracts being paid in 2nd quarter. jump in!"
what caused the meteoric SP rise late last year?
"In the last 4 quarters the company reported 2 earnings beat, 1 meet and one slight miss... The stock got over extended. Most traders are taking profits. A bounce will come but I think we'll see some more pain before a gain."
Good luck they are trying to get people to panics. Geesh
are we gonna see 1.8 again ?
buying all I can
will there be any good news tomorrow? what do you think?
"Q4 earnings estimate is $0.00. ""On average, sell-side analysts predict that Fuel Tech will post -0.04 EPS for the current fiscal year."""
It got compliance why is it down
"Indoor airflow within factories, hospitals, nursing homes, universities has Not been taken seriously with the industrial landscape. It took Flint Michigan to change water's perception and now on the air side, it took this dreaded Covid virus.This could get interesting for FTEK, debt free, restructured, worth a shot"

It’s clear that the only bag holder here is Joe. Making fake accounts to agree with him is just sad
Somebody knows something. Are we expecting any news or another Gap up to $4/$5/$7 range ? The open interest on the call options seems interesting. I'd love to see a squeeze gap up of 50% to 150% today or tomorrow.

Looking for revenues in the 15 MIL area. E.P.S +.04 Q3 2018. Technologies to enable clean efficient energy."
"I’ve watched this company at trade shows in the industry for years. Coal fired power plants are NOT gonna come back. Ever. If you’ve got a profit this morning, be wise at take the gift horse. Go buy yourself a new refrigerator or something."
