"Decided to jon the party 15,000@1.86 looks like a solid company. Bottom is in. Enough cash. Backlog with orders. Strong buy on Zacks. Looks promising!"
"Has my blessings, hope it goes to $20."
There has to be some news to drive volume and price up so abruptly. Anyone have that answer ?
Somebody knows something. Are we expecting any news or another Gap up to $4/$5/$7 range ? The open interest on the call options seems interesting. I'd love to see a squeeze gap up of 50% to 150% today or tomorrow.
Anyone having fun yet?
Just getting noticed by traders. Still in the early stage before the huge pop.
"C’mon guys! If you’re not in already, this is still a “decent” buying opportunity. Been following this stop for a long time and will continue to Hold until Solar because common."
They had some interesting insights about FTEK on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Even though FTEK is reaping some benefits from Sen. Manchin wanting to cut back on the clean energy plan, and let coal run free, I think the big jump was on a misreading of stock call letters. Severl days ago, pasted on the FTEK page was a big announcement from TTEK on a $400mm by back program. TTEK...FTEK not much difference in call letters, big difference in news."
Yesir
Let’s go guys. $cei is 350m market cap. $ftek is only 50m. Can see $14 price on this.
"$FTEK, $FCEL With this vol, this stock will continue to run for at least to next week."
Mr. Anonymous said he will sell me the Brooklyn Bridge for $1 if $FTEK go back up ha ha ha
