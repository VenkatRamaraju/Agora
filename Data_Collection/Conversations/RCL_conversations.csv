"Someone in this board mentioned about the reality of Chapter 11. Scary. But, looks like the cruise industry is painfully moving towards that point."
Let's be honest. It's a miracle that none of the stocks of the big three cruise companies are not below $4/share right now. Keep buying?

"WARNING: Brokerage firms added programing for new tax laws, aimed at the rich. The brokerage firms are taking any loss from every small trade and reversing it and applying percentage of it as cost reduction to same stock or even unrelated stocks. They are doing this to deter small traders. Watch your cost basis closely. What was intended to make the rich pay their fair share is now being used to deter everyday Americans from trading."
"with FULL FDA approval for Pfizers vaccine we should see more people willing to take the jab, and more trips taken. See you at $90 soon!"
Well Caribbean is a tap class well-run company. Unfortunately the world we live in has created an intangible that will affect the business model of this fine conglomerate In a way many will not imagine. I still believe it's a good long-term hold but the short term will be choppy waters with many going overboard.
Notice that the shorts only comment on green days?
BA RCL will rise together as usual - BA profits for the first time in 2 years and production on 737 Max rises.
Does Royal Caribbean require proof of vaccination or does it only test negative for Covid?
J&J booster has amazi g results.. Antibodies 9x with booster.. Wait till CDC approves J&J like they did with Pfizer this week. Just upward movement from here..
This one is going to dropâ€¦ their new Covid restrictions will decrease future revenue by restricting travel to only those who are vaccinated.
"weak day for the travel sector, although it appears to have found the bottom, and 79 proved to be strong support. It may not get back to the green today, but promising support looks like another leg up is inevitable."
"I wrote two days ago we broke through a major support level.. If we break $90 in a few weeks, we will break $100...Go longs"
"RCL is up and running good. We have been on 3 cruises so far since they opened. 2 ships had covid cases and the people were sent packing. 95% are vaccinated. The people who tested positive were unvaccinated and were children. Royal has contact tracing and they test anyone who was around them. The ships are about 40-50% capacity. RCL is top of the cruise industry. We are leaving for 4 weeks on RCL Sunday, Dont think for one minutes RCL will go bankrupt."
The Israel research on the booster shot is fabulous.. I've owned all 3 cruise stocks for 13 months.. CNBC talking about full approval for Pfizer by FDA
This stocks still up from where I bought it a while ago. So many cruise companies are saying they will have around 80% of their ships sailing by the end of 2021. Royal said they will be cash flow positive early next year (what's that like 4 months away?)I think the investors like inversely glued the algos to covid charts. Well things could get better with covid.
"Has anyone ever noticed the volumes, Friday evening 8/6/21 2.9 million, Today 8/8/21 4.4 million? More trading is done after the market closes than when the market is open. Exact volume and price data is never shown."
"Cybersecurity breakthrough within days of NASDAQ listing and $10 million cash from MAXIM. Only 750,000 shares total outstanding. Price ready to pop really big! Comps suggest $4.00 to $50. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5630521-microsoft-investment-in-4b-rubrik-cybersecurity-highlights-undiscovered-4m-data443-extremely"
"So, no comment on the extra ONE BILLION Dollar debt they are taking on. This will sink before it swims again."
"Think about this for a second: Everyone on board has to be vaccinated and test negative before boarding. They still found 6 people who tested positive. Only one had ""mild symptoms."" But they still ENDED THE CRUISE immedately and sent everyone home from the Bahamas. How is cruising supposed to restart under these conditions? $CCL $NCLH"
