"The strong cruse lines will survive and stock price over the long term will be restored, unless the Coronavirus becomes a multi-year uncontrolled pandemic which is unlikely. This is an attractive price per share entry point over a long-term horizon. With that in mind, people over react and have short-term investment horizons. For that matter, I still expect te price per share to come down significantly before it hits bottom. I am observing carefully and, out of abundance of caution, getting in if and when the price per share event gets in the neighborhood of ~$35. But it may be a very nice investment long term even at today’s price. However, pretty probably that lower lows are coming before we hit bottom."

The low of $19.25 will be tested this week. The only reason it rose up off that level was the anticipation of a bailout which didn't happen as confirmed on Friday.
"Don't you all agree that Chapter 11 is the only way out given the massive monthly cash burn and no revenue for months or even years?1. Richard Fain, the CEO said 50% of customers are asking for their money back2.

"Wall Street And Technical Outlook(Bankruptcy better option,Chapter 11 not an option already has short term debt payment in plan,chapter 13 better option)Wall Street consensus didn’t budge after the quarterly report, with a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating based upon 7 ‘Buy’, 8 ‘Hold’, and just 2 ‘Sell’ recommendations. The mix looks highly unrealistic, given the possibility that the company will run out of lending facilities and be forced to declare bankruptcy. Price targets currently range from a low of $35 to a street-high $75 while the stock closed Friday’s session about $6 above the median $54 target. This lofty placement suggests it’s more than fully-valued at this time."
Congrats friends! Stacking paper shouldn't be this easy. And just wait till the next positive news comes out about vaccine trials and also a plan to bring crusises back. So many huge catalysts ahead of us.
Every other US tax paying industry will get help first. Cruise lines bottom of list.
I don't understand how this companys stock is staying at these levels.
"The new can not get any worse. The market as a whole has 50% of us dying. Market fundamentals are still intact. Just an over reaction to a global slow down for the next quarter. This is more fear then it is technical. I own this at an average of around $45. In a wait and see mode now. One thing the I have learned through 2000, 2008 and 2014, Markets retreat rapidly but and they bounce back rapidly. Getting out causes much more pain then staying in. If you buy at $35 and it drops to $25 you will be upset but if you buy at $35 and it drops to $25 and you get out then bounces to $55 you will have nightmares for months."
"I know that all the cruise lines have been trying to raise cash (CCL, RCL, NCLH). But I have to say that I feel cheated when my shares get diluted. I know this is a standard way for companies to generate cash, but it really is a disservice to existing shareholders."
"How soon we forget but the loss was much more and will be even more in 3rd quarter as cancellations sky rocket.Royal Caribbean offers $3.3 billion in bonds, pledges 28 ships as collateral2 MIN READ(Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL.N) on Wednesday launched a $3.3 billion bond offering, pledging 28 of its ships as collateral and forecast heavy losses for the first quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic brings the sector to a virtual standstill.Royal Caribbean, which was forced to suspend its cruises globally and cut about 26% of its U.S. workforce, said the health crisis has dented its first-quarter net income by about $453 million.The cruise operator’s shares, which have sunk over 72% this year, fell 4% in early trading.The company expects to report a preliminary first-quarter net loss of $1.44 billion compared to a profit of $249.7 million a year earlier, as it prepares to write down the value of its Silversea Cruises unit and several ships by $1 billion to $1.3 billion"

"Remain optimistic, but don't underestimate Delta variant. Based on recently reported numbers, nearly 20% of administered covid tests end up positive. This is a major sign of a widespread infection."
"Lots of support to keep stocks where they are. CDC 132 and John Hopkins 135 per day , 000's and not slowing down. Can the other Gods maintain these prices, with these covid numbers? absolutely!"
"Market too far ahead on $RCL, not same company it was a year ago. Massive $20B high-interest debt, increased shareholder dilution, impending cruise delays. CDC still imposing strict restrictions on the on ALL cruises. And +250M/month cash burn. RCL fairly valued ~55/share or less..."
Now let's have some of the 6% shorts start covering... They've lost over 10% in a WEEK..
"My issue with the cruise industry is that the royal ships all have the green light by the CDC to start test sailings but they are not (or the news isn’t reporting it). If the ships are in compliance why do they keep canceling cruises. April cruises were just canceled yesterday, pushing cruising out until May. They have supposedly had this green light since November or December so what am I missing. This is driving the stock price lower IMO."
"What just happened with CCL is a bit complicated but I'll try to explain. A few months ago, some folks bought bonds from CCL that pay the holders 5.75% per year until 2024. (The bond is called a ""Senior Convertible Note"" but more on that later.)In 2024, the holders can either get their principal back or get the equivalent cash back in the form of stocks at whatever the price happens to be in 2024. Instead of having to pay these guys 5.75% for the next few years and then return their principal, CCL offered to ""buy"" their bonds back by giving the holders equivalent shares (worth $14.02 at the time of the transaction) today. About half the bondholders agreed. Last night they took shares from CCL in exchange for their claims to the following:-5.75% per year for four years-the principal cost of the bond-equivalent CCL shares in 2024AND because these were Senior Convertible Notes, they also give up these rights:-rights to any property, cash, investments, ships, or any assets that may remain after bankruptcy, less court and litigation costs and other fees.CCL received no cash from the transaction and, in fact, had to pay about $200m in fees. They diluted your shares to the tune of 5.5 millike and. The sell off premarket was some of these bondholders receiving and then immediately selling those shares for whatever price they can get for them. We can expect more selling from them in the next few days or weeks.We know why CCL did this--to free up about $1.5b in much needed cash that they'd owe between now and 2024. But now ask yourself: Why would the bondholders agree to give up all these benefits for just $14.02? Here are a few reasons:-they think shares will be worth less than $14.02 in 2024-they don't think CCL shares will exist in 2024-they don't think they will get their principal back in 2024-they don't think they'll get 5.75% each year until 2024-they don't think the value of assets after bankruptcy will be enough to return their principalIn short, about half the bondholders (e.g., ""smart money"" private hedge funds) decided that the above scenario is more likely than not and took the deal. Do with this information what you'd like and draw your own conclusions. But this is a very significant development that indicates the future direction of CCL.$nclh $rcl $ccl"

Notice that the shorts only comment on green days?
"Over 18 months into the pandemic, cruise companies are offering ""cruises to nowhere."" New variants are emerging on a quarterly basis and winter is approaching. Studies show vaccine effectiveness is waning quickly while Israel is planning the *fourth* booster shot in the coming months. Can't understand how anyone can be invested in cruise stocks at this point. $NCLH $CCL $RCL https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/cruise-to-nowhere-hong-kong/index.html?utm_content=2021-09-13T08%3A15%3A05&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_term=link"
"We are currently having a global pandemic of the Covid-19 virus.Cruise ships have shown themselves to be very efficient disease incubators, both in the past with norovirus outbreaks, and recently with the disturbing spread of the Covid-19 virus on the Diamond Princess in Yokohama Bay. Multiple ports in the West Pacific have closed down and are refusing to allow scheduled visits by cruise ships. In an effort to deal with this emerging problem, the cruise ship industry has cancelled some scheduled cruises in the West Pacific and has also locked out travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau on all of their cruises. As the geographic range of the virus increases, these measures are becoming inadequate. Ultimately, I'm thinking that the cruise lines will have to completely shut down operations for some period of time. There are 3 publicly traded cruise line companies: Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL), and Norwegian (NCLH). I've had a look at the balance sheets for each of them and have found a very troubling commonality. To wit, the business model for cruise lines dictates negative working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) with no liquidity reserve. Each of these companies is entirely dependent upon current cash flow to meet their current obligations. It looks like it is normal for them to live on the edge of a financial cliff. If they are forced to suspend their operations, their illiquidity could quickly turn to insolvency and perhaps even bankruptcy. This is VERY BEARISH.For full disclosure, I have purchased put options for all 3 of these companies."
I still can’t get the long side argument right now. Can someone please counter these points on the negative side:1) likely no meaningful revenues in 20202) 2021 revenues likely suppressed minimally at the very least3) greatly increased debt levels and therefore interest payments for years to come4) no dividend for years at a min5) increased costs of constant cleaning6) reduced capacities onboard for the foreseeable futureI’m sure there are more so anyone not seeing the positives please add to the list.And longs please counter the argument
Now! It’s not only due to delta virus! It’s bc of bad economy and super high operation cost!  LVS and MGM are triggering sell-off in entertainment industry.
"Comments from the US Government Coronavirus Task Force this evening March 10th (link to video below):1. Noone from the particularly vulnerable population is going out on a cruise in the near future.2. If someone gets seriously ill on a cruise ship, whether from Coronavirus or another cause, the cost of medical care onboard the ship, airlift evacuation, and land based care will be at the expense of the cruise line.3. The cruise line industry provided Government a proposal today. Government will be reviewing the proposal within the next 24 hours and putting plans in place to ensure the safety of the passengers. They will look specifically at the hardest hit states being Florida, Washington, California, and New York. 4. The last question of the Q & A session was a 2 part question on coronavirus tests and cruise industry potential bailout. The test question was answered but the bailout question was not. 5. They mentioned tax deferrals to assist the hardest hit industries including airlines and cruise lines but the most important focus of the stimulus package is to assist individuals will sick benefits and lost wages.Now it makes sense why RCL and NCLH increased their lines of credit with banks over the past 24 hours.Link to the press conference below (cruise comments start around 4:25 into the video). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k55xdwKJTw"
"A lot of quality comments here about the company and its future. I would like to see some discussion on how and when the company can return to full operations and what that looks like.IMHO, that won't even begin to take place until sometime in 2021 and that there will be new regulations and requirements to upgrade all the ships' HVAC systems to ensure that the risk of cabin-to-cabin spread of potential viruses is greatly reduced and perhaps other upgrades to mitigate virus spread (installation of virus and bacterial resistant surfaces, special cleaning requirements, new kitchen and dining requirements, etc).I also think the big ships (2500+ passengers) will have limited ports of call around the world and may become floating resorts/casinos that sail by some great places but rarely put into a port-of-call. I think this will happen for sure in Europe and perhaps other places. I believe that all passengers will be required to provide a medical certificate to assess risk and at a minimum show that the passenger either has been vaccinated against Coronavirus or has antibodies (acquired immunity). Since one infected person can shut down a cruise, this practice is in the interest of all parties.On the finance side, I am not familiar with the debt covenants but I suspect they have some standard coverage language regarding interest/EBITDA and EBITDA/ Debt, etc. I think EBITDA will be negative for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters and at the very least, be required to give up equity to get new debt agreements. God knows what they are going to do with the ships scheduled that are to be delivered over the next year.We are in an unprecedented period and my crystal ball is no better than anyone else's but we are at the beginning of this. It will hard to be long for quite a while."
With the unvaccinated virus raging what is the new low? $75 ?
"What deception shall we see today? I predict that the Other Gods will be piling out of RCL as the price is extremely high for 70,000 new cases from John Hopkins and 80,000 new cases from CDC. Or the truly deceptive/evil would be to go on to even highs regardless of covid while RCL dumps their own shares."
"So, no comment on the extra ONE BILLION Dollar debt they are taking on. This will sink before it swims again."
"89 in 2 weeks. doesn't matter if there's no earnings this quarter. get in while you can, cause the world is going back to normal."
"Think about this for a second: Everyone on board has to be vaccinated and test negative before boarding. They still found 6 people who tested positive. Only one had ""mild symptoms."" But they still ENDED THE CRUISE immedately and sent everyone home from the Bahamas. How is cruising supposed to restart under these conditions? $CCL $NCLH"
good pop this morning 
"You guys , I don't see cruise will be up and running even in 2021. I think 2022 the very earliest. I do marathon distance and my race was in May 2021 in MI. Yesterday, I got an email they canceled that already. Look at the wordings they use. I will paste here:Dear 2021 Bayshore Registrants,The Traverse City Track Club announces that the 39th annual Bayshore Marathon, Half Marathon and 10K will be converting to a virtual event. Please see below for your options.“TCTC has been monitoring developments in the running event industry, and following the guidelines of local, state and national authorities, medical advisors, volunteers, participants and community partners as we continue to work through the pandemic. We did not take the decision to cancel the traditional in-person event lightly,” said Lisa Taylor, executive director of Traverse City Track Club.“MDHHS orders will be our primary guide. I do not suspect restrictions being lifted until we are post-pandemic, meaning we have achieved herd immunity and minimal new cases. Vaccine production, distribution and acceptance could exceed expectations but it is unlikely.” Dr. Jim Zeratsky, Event Medical Director."
"The average cruise ship uses 80,000 gallons of fuel a day, the drop in oil prices alone is going to save millions in cost."
"With the way the covid19 pandemic is spreading, there will be either no sailing or very limited sailing for the next 12 to 16 months. I think anything meaningful sailing activity will most likely have to wait until April of 2022 to resume in a meaningful way. This stigma will be with consumers and cruisers alike for a long time and cannot change consumer behavior overnight. In the meantime, because of the huge overhead and fixed cost that must be paid in order to maintain the cruise ships in working condition, RCL will continue to experience cash burn rate of $280 million per months and similar hit to its equity or enterprise value in that duration. That is $1.17 per share per month or $3.51 per share every quarter, or $14 per share every twelve months. That is 19% to the negative at today's RCL stock price per share of roughly $72.00. If the stock declines or the borrowing costs increase due to credit downgrade, the impact will be even sharper or more significant. If you believe RCL is still undervalued in this kind of situation, your mind is a wonder to behold. But I doubt you can hold onto your capital invested in RCL for too long."
I sold at $58 yesterday thinking it would drop a little today and I could get back in for lower..... I was wrong haha. Been holding since $25!!! Shoulda just stuck with it.
"Still developing, pharma creating covid vaccine in pill form..."
"just announced they think earnings will be better then previous quarter...LOL - they lost -$6.13 last quarter and now the estimate is #$%$20 - this is hilarious - btw before Covid and pandemic - they still had a 3 quarter loss of -$.04. There are accounting things you can do to make numbers look better and they may do those - however, that will be the last cork in the bottle holding this thing up from BK. If I added it up right -$12.61 per share loss for the year - on 223 million shares - that's -$2.8 billion loss - with a B. Then they took on $4 billion +/- in additional debt - this is BK they just haven't told anyone yet...it's got to declare if they ever want to sail again under restructuring."
Great stock to own buy at $67-$69. Earnings disappointed but too high of expectations. But demand and future looking bright. Delta variant is not gonna impact cruise lines substantially. Maybe slow down things for a couple of weeks to months that’s about it.
"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A passenger aboard a Royal Caribbean ‘cruise-to-nowhere’ from Singapore has tested positive for COVID-19, forcing around 2,000 guests to be quarantined in their cabins and the Quantum of the Seas ship to return to dock on Wednesday."
Most over valued
The Israel research on the booster shot is fabulous.. I've owned all 3 cruise stocks for 13 months.. CNBC talking about full approval for Pfizer by FDA
"RCL reset to 71.79, will it reset again $5 or $3 lower, like last time? They love to burn the swing traders more than breathing. Time will tell. The virus may be at its peak, but its hard to tell with CDC leaving off a decimal place."
I believe there is long term value in this stock but not at these prices. $25 seems like a fair value.
Does Royal Caribbean require proof of vaccination or does it only test negative for Covid?
Wait or sell? I bought a few shares at 67 yesterday. I dont mind sitting on it
BA RCL will rise together as usual - BA profits for the first time in 2 years and production on 737 Max rises.
"Has anyone read or heard where a cruise line asked for a US bailout? I haven't. They all received increases in their lines of credit, however.Cruise lines are incorporated outside the US because the US labor laws would make cruise fares prohibitive for many customers. The 6,000 person floating cities would become extinct. Don't get me wrong, RCL stock is super risky now. However, it has risen from the ashes before, and mgt could do it again."
"With today's offering RCL has now done the following since the virus hit:1. $600 million in credit facility drawdown2. $3.32 billion in secured notes, 1 billion due in 2023 and 2.32 billion due in 20253. An additional 1 billion in secured notes due 2023.4. $1.65 billion in convertible notes due/convertible in 2023. 5. 9.6 million new shares of common stock representing about a 4.5% dilution.6. Today's announcement of $1.5 billion in common stock which at Friday's closing price represents about 16 million shares (about a 7% dilution).It's hard to pinpoint the cumulative effect of these measures on the company once it ""returns to normal."" We don't know the interest rates of some of the debt and we don't know things like whether it cold be refinanced or extended we also don't know which creditors are going to convert shares and which aren't.RCL had about $1.8 billion in profits in 2019. I estimate that just the new debt alone (about $5 billion) is going to cost them $300-400 million a year to service. That's about a 15% impact. Then you add in the new dilution from the new shares--about an 11-12% impact. Bottom line: the stock price, even if it returns to ""normal"" (high was 133 in 2019) is going to take about a 25% hit. That means a fair target price (133 x .75) is about $99 a share. Look where we are at now. I'm just not seeing this as a compelling investment...and I own the stock. :("
"Wash Sale/Disallowed loss: If small swing traders averages in, then they have to sell above every purchase price or wait 30 days to purchase the same stock again, else they are hit with disallowed loss.

This one is going to drop… their new Covid restrictions will decrease future revenue by restricting travel to only those who are vaccinated.
"I am going to short cruise lines (RCL, CCL, CUK, NCLH) and casino/hotel stocks on Monday. There is no reasonable bull thesis for these industries in the short term IMHO. Long term, they may indeed bounce back, but short term, there will be nothing but red. Deep red."
"Whoever is buying here has my utmost respect because it takes tremendous courage to buy the stock of a company currently generating no revenue, with no firm date when revenue will start again, with massive capital commitments for new ships, with enormous fixed expenses that cannot be reduced (as opposed to some variable expenses for food, fuel and people that can be reduced), and with a lot of debt...a company whose customers may not have the money to go on a cruise when cruising starts up because they have lost their jobs and/or lost their savings That is a level of courage I can only dream of having."

"During the depression my Great Grandpa Ernie had money and folks were panicking so he helped them out and bought a number of their farms. He saw the value of what they had and unfortunately they either didn't see it or were not in a position were they could hold on to it. Ernie's 13 children ended up with the farms after he passed. RCL currently has a P/E of 2.5, $1.17 in cash per share, and the average analysts estimates has a target price of $99 per share so if that's true it's trading at least at a 75% discount. If cruising returns sooner rather than later and there is no interruption in dividend payments than the yield is almost 14%. Berkshire Hathaway has been hoarding cash for years and this looks to me exactly like the value stock the Oracle of Omaha might want to buy. I hope you don't let some of the analysts recent ratings of this stock keep you from getting in as they could be holding short positions. I'm still kicking myself after not going long on this stock after 9/11, after the 2008 downturn, and after the 2014 Zika scare. Grandpa Ernie's daughter, my grandmother lived well off the money from the farms invested in CD's in the 1970's that paid as high as 11%. I'm hoping I can live comfortably off the 14% yield RCL may be promising. Nope were not buying family farms here just 61 cruise ships with more on order and a company with a track record of resiliency. Do your own due diligence but I see incredible value here maybe I get it from Great Grandpa Ernie."
This is a great company with one of the best CEO’s around. Unfortunately what they are facing now is going to impact earnings in a huge way. Guidance will also be bleak and almost impossible for them to predict. I might nibble a bit sub 90 but the truth is it could go much lower over the next 12 months. Pandemic is very possible and if so 60-70 percent of the world’s population will have been exposed a year from now. GLTA
Honestly. RCL will be below 79 from now on!

"To short sellers and those wondering why this is up 11%+ - This thing makes no sense to go up 11%+ and be at 11 month highs when reporting a loss of $1.1Billion...they aren't even going to be cruising until end of year.Nonetheless, if you are one of those playing the short game on this stock...don't try to make sense of the price increases. Just stop fighting it and get out of that position...maybe not today on a big up day but find a good exit price. Market Makers/institutions are manipulating this stock big time is the only thing that makes sense. I use to have a short position in RCL until I got burned 5-6 months ago and was forced to close out my position and take the loss to stop it from growing.Honestly with how the market is lately...it's best to avoid shorting and find good stocks to hold, both short term and long term. Just my thoughts from being in your shoes before.I actually almost bought a position recently at $65 to go long on this stock since it goes up on bad news, only highlighting the future potential that is still more than 6-12 months away!"
"small swing trader, your being targeted. If you average in and your 1st shares purchased are less than the share sell price, this is being targeted as a wash sale and a disallowed loss is calculated. What you say, the dates matter. No they don't! I say again, your being targeted. If a loss on any transaction is calculated! They are disregarding the dates so that as many complaints as possible can be generated. The alternative, never sale without a gain or be in perfect sink with the other Gods."

Rcl just cancelled a cruise out of Australia for April 2022
"As I write this, cruise is a little down pre-market, likely due to AstraZeneca pausing it's vaccine trails (temporarily, and out of an abundance of caution) because one participant had an adverse reaction. It's unclear what happened, it may not even have been the vaccine, they will pause until they can investigate, these pauses are a normal part of the process. This is not impacting the timeline of a vaccine, as the two front runners, Moderna and Pfizer, use a different technology and delivery system, and both are up pre-market. AstraZennaca is down less pre-market than some cruise companies$RCL $CCL $NCLH, if that gives an idea at the level of worry. Feel free to invest as you will, of course, but I suspect any momentary dips in cruise will be short lived. Vaccines are still likely landing late November, maybe even October, nothing has changed there. The 15 minute Covid-19 test likely to help restart cruise, and the real game changer, is totally unaffected. If you are long or investing long with the idea that vaccines, testing, and therapeutics will help restart the cruising industry sooner than expected, this pause with one company does not impact or change that strategy, or even hurt it's timeline."
"Someone against the vaccine said that there are less deaths. A $83,000 hospital bill is a financial death. Even if you just pay half $41,500 would be hard for me to swallow, just to say I stand for freedom and I am unvaccinated."

"I worked for Royal Caribbean and on other lines between 1997 and 2002.After 09/11/01 RCL dipped to $9 a share and in 02 recovered to $20 by 03, $30 by 04, and $40 by 05.After 2008 it dipped to $06 in 09 and recovered to $35 and by 2014 it was trading in the $50 range. It reached highs of $135 in 2018.In 2014 I was trading the stock between 60 and $70 but it got away from me.I’m going long now because I know this is the company that has beaten it’s way back in to profitability after 911, after the financial crisis in 2008, and after the Zika scare.Back at the turn of the century seven day cruise’s typically had just one sea day. Look at the itinerary for the RCL ships now. They have two sea days and sometimes even visits to two private islands in the Caribbean. This means the company has gotten really good at generating revenue on board and on its islands. Do your due diligence and see how many cabins are available in May. Not many. Soon you will likely see CEO Richard Fain start buying stock like he did back in 2014. This stock is way over sold in my humble opinion."

"July 9 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp's AIDA Cruises said on Thursday it would resume sailing operations in August, months after cruise operators were forced to pause voyages due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Germany-based cruise line said it has introduced a variety of coronavirus preventive measures to complement existing health and hygiene standards, as it restarts operations.Cruise operators have suspended most of their operations since March as the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak has forced several countries to mandate lockdowns and travel restrictions.Earlier this week, rivals Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd had announced a joint task force to help develop safety standards for restarting their businesses during the pandemic."
It’s rare to get an investment opportunity to purchase a company with a book value of $58 per share at these prices. The ships are built and ready to resume service once Covid 19 is contained. Promising news from scientists regarding quick testing. No bailout required as banks who lent money to RCL in the countries they were built in are now partners. Shorts do you really think these financial institutions who lent money to RCL are just going to sit back and let their investments tank?
"sadly not only RCL but every single cruise line will tank very hard on Monday. I don't undertand why thr government announce this 100 days ban after market uis close and ready for 3 days holidays. Only companies will save their money because they will start trading 2 hours before us so they will make cruise line tank for 30% or more before we can even touch our shares , NOT FAIR. If the government announce this during trade section we all have the same opportunity to sell our shares, only companies will minimize their lost on Monday while shareholders will swallow a huge lost ."
"Please allow me to elaborate as to why I will short this on Tuesday morning (AZN will release peer reviewed P/1 results tomorrow on their vaccine and RCL will likely jump). Please jump in and let me know what you think. Apart from the obvious reason to short that have been mentioned here time and time again, the below. 1). As I understand it from my DD, the largest customer demographic is the elderly (let's call it retirement age, ranging from 62-66 years of age depending on the nationality). Here lies a deadly problem in that ALL current vaccine trails (all P/1 and upcoming P2/3) are using cohorts 50 years of age or younger with 1 biotech going to a max of 55 years of age. With the above in mind it is safe to assume that the largest customer demographic is out of the picture for the foreseeable future. 2). International travel is and will continue to be greatly impacted, this will not be eliminated without a good reason, being a vaccine. Of course this will loosen up in the near future 2-3 months, but i expect countries will go the way spain is inclining and require a forced quarantine upon arrival (for none nationals or legal residents).3). Caribbean countries are quickly becoming some of the most COVID impacted countries in the world.4). It is unclear to me if RCL has increased their hedge on fuel and to what degree given the current pricing. I am of the idea (no proof) that during this financial crisis they are not taking advantage of the current prices as they are trying to keep afloat. They would need to be somewhere between 50% and 70% hedged for the fuel costs of the next operating year.5). The crew, across all job descriptions, will need to be extremely well monitored and i suspect they will NOT be allowed to go home if working on an operational ship during the end of the year and prior to vaccination. The cost for this will likely be high as RCL will not risk the crew going home and returning to work infected. As many of you know, the lion's share of the crew come from developing countries which are highly impacted by COVID. I am convinced that this stock will settle in the mid to high $30's within the next 2 months and begin a slow steady climb up as they pay down their debt, are allowed to increase passenger capacity and increase operational routes and destinations over the next years. Thank you in advance for your input on the above."
"What happenedCruise line stocks are dropping across the board in Thursday-afternoon trading -- and that just isn't fair.As of 12:35 p.m. EDT, shares of Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) have tumbled 5.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NASDAQ:NCLH) is down 4.2%, and even industry giant Carnival (NYSE:CCL) (NYSE:CUK) is slipping 2.5%. Furthermore, all three of these cruise stocks were down more than 5% in trading earlier in the day.And yet the news isn't all bad.Chart of new COVID-19 cases dated July 9, 2020.NEW COVID-19 CASES REPORTED DAILY THROUGH JULY 9, 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: OUR WORLD IN DATA, A PROJECT OF THE GLOBAL CHANGE DATA LAB 2020. LICENSED UNDER CC BY. CHART COPYRIGHT OUR WORLD IN DATA, A PROJECT OF THE GLOBAL CHANGE DATA LAB 2020.So whatWednesday, as you may recall, representatives from cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise joined forces to form a Healthy Sail Panel taskforce to work out procedures to ensure passenger safety if and when cruise lines are permitted to resume sailing later this year. Not long after this was announced, moreover, it was revealed that the independent auditor in charge of reviewing Norwegian's books found the company's financial position sufficiently improved that it removed a comment expressing ""substantial doubt about NCLH's ability to continue as a going concern.""Granted, that's something of a double negative. But what it means, in effect, is that in the current opinion of its auditor, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings will not go under, will not succumb to the coronavirus pandemic, and will survive to emerge on the other side of this recession healthy enough to remain in business.Moreover, this morning, Carnival subsidiary AIDA Cruises announced that it plans to resume cruising in August -- ahead of the Sept. 15 U.S. restart date previously promised by most cruise lines. Three of AIDA's vessels plan to resume cruising from ports in Germany, each operating under ""a comprehensive set of health and hygiene protocols to help facilitate a safe, healthy and phased-in return to cruise vacations."" They're sailing with an ""adjusted passenger capacity,"" to be sure, and ""without calling at another port"" -- but they're sailing, and that has to be good news for Carnival's revenue stream.Analysts at Wells Fargo promptly more than doubled their price target on Carnival stock to $12 a share.Now whatSo why are cruise stock prices going down today instead of up? Partly, I suspect, this is an effect of the negative macroeconomic news we got today: 33 million Americans are still out of work and unlikely to have the discretionary income to spend on a cruise until they find new jobs. And daily new cases of coronavirus infection continue to edge up both in the U.S. and globally, and the World Health Organization warns that the pandemic is definitely ""not under control"" just yet.And partly, it's an effect of cruise stocks being stocks, period, and thus susceptible to being dragged down when stock market sentiment sours -- as it's doing today, with the S&P 500 down as much as 1%.It's a shame, and it's not fair, seeing as today's cruise news is actually pretty good. But then again, no one ever promised that the stock market would treat you fairly."
"This industry and the airlines are doomed for the next several years. My parents just canceled their cruise for next year, because they don't want to feel like they are in #$%$ germany on vacay. Requirement of an antigen test - those test won't pick up covid unless you are sick in most cases. Also have to show vax papers for a vaccine that doesn't work well on delta. What is the point??? They aren't alone...I'm not going anywhere on a vacation that I have to show vaccine papers and test results. Want to take the family to Europe but I can't risk it...I don't want to go to places with lockdowns, vax/test requirements and masks. Red state vacations only for people like me. Been to Florida 3x's this year."

"It seems like the world is ending right? Media pumping news about COVID-19 24/7.I’ve not seen media talking about any positive news, have we ever? lolMarch is almost over and April is just around the corner. In some places, it is already getting hot.Convid-19 won’t make Cruise Ships Company go bankrupt.Do you want to know why?Coronavirus is no different from the Flu. They are actually a cousin. They both don’t do well against warmer weather. That’s why we don’t see much of Flu in spring and summer.We have no cure for Flu but have a vaccine for it and people get them every year to avoid them. But it doesn’t stop you from getting flu. Flu has already killed more than 15,000 people across US.When there was a Norovirus outbreak on cruise ships, it didn’t stop people from getting on the cruise ship next day.There are all sort of virus lingering around in the cruise ships. We can’t name them all.Convid-19 will be like Flu. Everyone will be infected. We’re not going to get the symptoms or most of us won’t realize it that we have it.All this social distancing and isolation can be very stressful. What would people do once it gets warmer and we start to get our life back? They all would want to book some sort of trip.All the companies will be well prepared to take on every customer.Every day, we understand better what CONVID-19 is and people are better than ever keeping up with their hygiene.I can go on about why the cruise ships company won’t go bankrupt but You get the point."
"Shows how out of touch with reality investors/speculators are. Stock goes up even though: ""Royal Caribbean Group's RCL, +2.03% credit rating is in danger of being downgraded deeper into junk territory by S&P Global Ratings, which citing expectations that the cruise operator's recovery will take longer than previously projected. The company's issuer credit rating of B+, which is four notches below investment grade territory, was put on CreditWatch with negative implications, as Royal's recently extended suspension of cruises through February is beyond S&P Global's assumptions, which was for operations to resume in a phased manner starting in the fourth quarter. ""Accordingly, we expects Royal to burn more cash relative to our previous expectations and for leverage to remain very high in 2021,"" S&P Global said."""
This whole industry is about to tank !
"Here's the issue that many on this board seem to be missing. It's not how soon the ships are allowed to sail. It's how many passengers will be aboard. What demographic makes up 75% of passengers? Retirees. They're being super cautious -- wearing masks, avoiding stores and restaurants, sticking pretty much to home. I know this because I am one. I'm 68. My wife and I took three cruises last year and friends joined us for all three. Last night we had cocktails (outside, on the patio, each couple six feet apart) with four couples we had traveled with and all of us said it's going to be a long, long time before we set foot on a boat again. There's going to have to be an effective vaccine before most retirees will even consider cruising again... and that isn't going to happen for a long time."

"I'm going to do a quick post to my fellow retail investors, that are not shills for some hedge group or bots, but just average folks trying to set up a potion. What I've noticed for over a month $NCLH, $CCL, and $RCL, really, all Covid-19 impacted stocks, airlines, casinos, etc, but specifically the cruise stocks have been on a down trend. For the last month, especially the last few weeks, they have been trading on very low volume. $NCLH, whcih I have been watching very carefully, has been acting like it has found strong support around 13 a share, and appears to be re-coupled mostly with the market. Why does it matter?I suspect we're seeing a bottom for these stocks, or somewhere near it, and we're going to see a trend change soon, and it will be on full daily volume. Why? I suspect the downward sell pressure in these stocks are weak retail longs selling off, and not institutional investors. Why are they weak and retail? ...because the drop has been painful, but the pain is short term, and it's mostly retail as institutions still hold close to 90% of these stocks. Why short term? Because Covid-19 cannot physically last forever, based on the data. Why do I say that? ...because I've been watching the numbers. The numbers of cases growing, some of the hotspot states, like Florida, California, even Arizona, appear, to be leveling off. I really don't understand why, if it's legitimate or manipulation, and why it isn't being more talked about in the media. Yes, the overall numbers of cases is bad, it's ...really bad. But it's not ""as bad"" as it was a week ago, or two weeks ago, or three weeks ago in some of the states that are supposed to be out of control. As investors, we trend to recognize these trends. If you don't believe me, just google it for yourself. It's like unemployment, it's bad, but, arguably, it's less bad than it was the week prior, and the week before that. When the cases went down before, we saw a HUGE upsurge in these stocks Covid-19 impacted stocks. Then the cases went up and these stocks started to drop...but now, they are going down again. Again, check yourself, let the numbers convince you. This time, we will have both declining cases and vaccines around the corner, no less than five promising candidates in Phase III human trials with results due Oct/Nov. There's also ENORMOUS political pressure to leak positive vaccine results to the markets before the US election, for obvious reasons. I'm not telling you what to do with you money, and I'm not saying this isn't all ""baked"" in. I don't think it is, as new agencies are just now starting to pick it up. You make your own call. I reposition more heavily in some of these Covid-19 stocks myself. I'm only typing this as it's fun to chat about stocks, but also just in case, it gives some investor out there like me another puzzle piece to add to their own strategy. Hope this helps.

"So now, the question is AGAIN, will RCL go back down to the 70's? I kick myself for not range trading this stock."
"I see opportunity for the older ships. Instead of selling off older ships, change the passenger. Introducing RCL Cargo. Contract out with corporations exclusively. You can fit a ton of Apple/Nike/Walmart products on a cruise ship. To the point where it is profitable to keep the older ships going. Corporations need to work out the logistical aspects, but it's probably cheaper than to pay the outrageous prices that cargo companies charge and have it sit in the port of Los Angeles for weeks."
"Just did some math on latest data from Israel trying to confim that vaccine protects people from hospitalization. Well, not so much.. Comparing peak in Israel in January data without vaccination to data from Aug 8th, probability of getting hospitalized is very much comparable. Despite having 85% adults vaccinated."
"Pent up demand coupled with widespread implementation of Covid vaccinations will propel all the cruise lines to higher heights in the coming years. This is a no-brainer, long-term profitable investment. Tough to time the up and down movement of the stock, due to inevitable fluctuations in circumstances and investor sentiment, so swing trading is tricky, but gradually adding on dips and holding seems to be a good strategy here."
absolutely unwarranted increase based on the fundamentals and guidance given in the earnings report
Federal judge has just over ruled Florida on vax requirements.
"I am negative cruise lines. I think when they talk about record sales I think they are talking about record rate of daily sales bookings in recent weeks (as we re-open) not record level of percentage of rooms booked overall (say for 2022). Too much pumping by Bulls. I do not see lifting of CDC until everyone vaccinated and then see results after. It is an easy bet for ""under"" of betting if cruising will start by July 4th. Most people think we will be cruising by May or June. I would not be surprised the whole year is lost. RCL has 2 workers out of 500 catch Covid and boat quarantined. What is the chance of getting zero infections once a boat sails with thousands of people on them? All you need is that to happen on 1 very 20 cruises and you have a mess. Refunds for passengers. Next cruise cancelled for cleaning. These are rules done now. RCL cruising Singapore at half capacity. I know of one cruise (just google for that article) that had issues with Covid (passengers had partial refund). Cruising profits may be forever dented in post Covid world."
Reopened a short position here. It’s outlandish to reward a stock for uncertainty and a huge loss that is likely to last for >6 months.
"The first cruise ship with paying passengers will leave from the U.S. on Saturday, marking the first revenue sail in 15 months and a significant milestone in the COVID-19 recovery for the industry. Celebrity Edge, operated by Royal Caribbean (RCL) subsidiary Celebrity Cruises, will depart Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale — floating on both the ocean waves and widespread hopes that the worst of the pandemic is behind the beleaguered travel industry."
"Due to the recent news about the comeback of the cruise lines would you suggest me to buy more stocks of RCL right now for 84$ a piece or to wait to the next drop? I'm a long-term trader, will wait at least 1 more year till I cash out."
This cruise stock has potential unlike Carnival corporation. Rcl will stay afloat.
Well Caribbean is a tap class well-run company. Unfortunately the world we live in has created an intangible that will affect the business model of this fine conglomerate In a way many will not imagine. I still believe it's a good long-term hold but the short term will be choppy waters with many going overboard.
Morgan Staney downgrade is HUGE.They were the investment bankers that gave RCL the $2.45B credit line and then managed the $3.3B bond offering. The fact they see no cruising until 2021 means these things are going down like the Titanic.
I am surprised to see that the stock is up in after hours trading when they announced a halt to cruising for 30 days. What did I miss?
"Assuming the cruise companies manage to survive, they will need to put in place expensive contingency plans to confront future such outbreaks. They will also need to offer DEEPLY discounted cruise fares and lots of other perks to try and desperately lure back customers. This means that they will won't have good financial results for quite some time after they eventually commence operations. This all will take a long time. In the meantime, cruise line stocks will be moribund. Short cruise stocks ASAP and profit on the way down. If you still have the stomach to take a long position in hopes of catching the far off recovery in their share prices, you can buy at a much lower level than now."
"With raging pandemic in at least first half of 2021 and by second half of 2021 , 20% to 30% of world population will have at least caught corona virus once and another 20% to 30% will probably get vaccinated. So far so good. This may give you a false sense of confidence that everything will be fine soon enough for the cruise and travel industry. In reality, corona virus impact may last much longer than many investors realize, especially for the travel and leisure industry. Most importantly, having caught corona virus once and having recovered from it once before or getting vaccinated with corona virus does not prevent you from catching a different strain of the corona virus again. Because the corona virus infects easily and mutate quickly, there are now countless different strains of corona virus around the world. It is like the flu virus which cannot be eradicated by vaccination and comes back every year. The cruise industry will start sailing again but will be forced by CDC to operate at half the capacity for at least 12 months and perhaps even years. Even if you assume that RCL will be able to somehow raise ticket prices(which I highly doubt, RCL and other players may even have to initially issue discounts to entice people to get on a cruise), so that you can get to 60% of the $11 billion revenue level that RCL generated in 2019, or $6.6 billion(60% of $11 billion) in their first full fiscal year after resuming operations during covid 19 pandemic, which I believe will be 2022, since RCL will probably resume sailing sometime mid-year in 2021. Below is what RCL's financial results will probably look like in 2022 using a formula derived from numbers from 2019(reported $11 billion revenue) and from 2010(reported $6.7 billion revenue), also adjusting for covid-19 impact such as sailing at 50% capacity.That means the financial statements will look like this in 2022 (first full fiscal year in operation post covid lockdown)2019revenue $11 billion(100%)operating income $2 billion(20%)operating cash flower $1.5 billion (15%)interest expense $409 millionshort and long-term debt $11 billion(short-term and long-term plus current portion of long-term)interest rate 3.7% ($409 million divided by $11 billion)purchase of property and equipment (averaged amount derived from 3 year total purchase divided by 3 year total revenue) $2.3 billionShare price in 2019 between $100 and $120 per share2010revenue $6.75 billion(100%)operating income $802 million(12% of revenue)operating cash flower $1.63 billion (24% or revenue)interest expense $371 millionlong-term debt $9.2 billion(long-term plus current portion of long-term)interest rate 4.0% ($371 million divided by $9.2 billion)purchase of property and equipment $2 billion(29% derived from 3 year total purchase divided by 3 year total annual revenue)Share price in 2010: between $20 and $40 per share2022revenue $6.6 billion(100%, or 60% of 2019 revenue, too optimistic?)operating income $660 million(10% very challenging to achieve due to operating at 50% capacity, nearly impossible to achieve 12% reached in 2010)operating cash flower $858 million (13%, probably wildly optimistic considering 50% capacity but more than 50% staffu?)interest expense $1.1 billion (projected)long-term debt $20 billion(projected long-term plus current portion of long-term)interest rate 5.5%purchase of property and equipment $1.0 billion(16% of 2022 revenue, maybe a little too low??)Projected to grow 30% in 2023(a wild guess, too optimistic?)Share price in 2022 = ???The billion dollar question is how much will investors be willing to pay for RCL per share given the operating metrics and the situation in 2022?My thoughts about the above 2022 projected revenue number is that 60% of 2019 level revenue is highly unlikely to occur in 2022 because that assumes up to 60% of the customers in 2019 will be willing to try cruise again in 2022, how likely is that given that there will probably still be covid-19 spreading around the world in 2022?My thinking is that if in 2010 RCL generated $6.75 billion with better margins, better operating income and cash flow and only $9 billion in debt, then, in 2022 RCL generating lower margins, lower operating income and low cash flow and more than $20 billion or double debt load simply should not be trading above the $20 to $40 per share range in which it traded in 2010, let alone significantly higher than that !!!"
$RCL biggest cruise ship scheduled to be delivered in November and starting sailing in China March 2022
"For all the buyers of cruise line stocks, including short covering shorts, at $26 per share, NCLH's total enterprise value (market cap plus total debts) have reached the highs before the covid-19 pandemic. It will take at least two years for cruise lines to be able to operate at full capacity before CDC's restrictions are lifted, in the main time, cruise lines, such as $NCLH, $CCL, $RCL, will continue to increase their debt loads and share counts as negative cashflows persists because of 50% capacity restrictions. It's your money and my posts is not investment advice, but for pure entertainment only. But, it seems obvious that cruise lines at best offer fully priced investments that yields low single digit annual returns, at worst will go belly up and shareholders' capital will disappear in a bankruptcy filing. You can say bye bye to your returns especially when you include inflation."

"Rising COVID cases does not help RCL, they can't handle another shutdown. It's bad enough with the Delta variant, but the one to watch is the Lambda variant which is vaccine resistant and starting to spin up in Texas. I would expect there's going to be a lot more COVID restrictions and social distancing and capacity restricted venues and cruise ships again."
The best time to buy a company is when it is on the operating table.
The Easter goal has now been delayed to the end of April. The market is not going to react well to the continued bad news and future timeline.
"Earnings were reported and it was a huge disappointment but like I said yesterday, analysts were expecting too much. They expected $150 billion, how is that possible for RCL, EPS was also much lower than expected. But booking volumes are looking good and the demand for cruises seem to soaring. But I am gonna lower my Target price from $98 to $88 but I still think that it’s a buy at these levels."
Price to sales 210. It will be years before the cruise lines are making money.
"And here we go, RCL attempts to refinance 1 billion of its debt with corporate notes as no bank will lend them any money anymore. Will the money really be spent on refinance, or is it another billion of debt?"

Let's be honest. It's a miracle that none of the stocks of the big three cruise companies are not below $4/share right now. Keep buying?

"Last year i was thinking of putting a small $5k IRA position into a cruise stock, both as an investment and to get the shareholder cruise benefit (100 share min). RCL would have required a lot more $ to buy 100 shares than I was willing to put in. Glad i did not buy then. Looks like the market is coming to me now, I will consider picking up my shareholder benefit min # of shares if I can get them for under $5k (= $50 or less stock price). RCL is probably the best managed of the major lines, although I'm not expecting a huge bounceback here for quite a while, but within a few years it should be riding high again"
"The other Gods reset RCL to 67.78 on 7/19 due to covid, thinking that there would be a short increase and then decline. However, the increase is increasing. Its time to reset RCL again."

"Love this stock! Yes it is going down. Great buy on the dips and go long! Here's why. Every company in Big Pharma is working as hard as possible to find the vaccine or a very good treatment for Covid-19. They have been incentivized by the government to develop a cure or treatment. EVEN if they fail...The government will reimburse or make them whole again as long as it is a ""Covid-19 treatment"" related loss. Let that sink in. On the other hand the first one to find the cure or treatment is going to be richly rewarded throughout the whole world. So, will there be a cure, vaccine, or effective treatment within the next 12-18 months? We will see. But the best minds in the world and incredibly focused on it. They say the Stock Market is gambling. I'm willing to buy RCL on the dips and ride it up or down for 12-18 months because when (not if) Big Pharma finds the cure, vaccine, or effective treatment, RCL will be right back at 133.00 or more. Just don't panic if it wiggles for a while."
"Cost of Debt Initial and On goingSo far they raise $550M (Getting cash from their line of credit), $2.2B (364 day loan, re-payed $2.35B with 3.2B new debt), $3.2B Senior notes, $1B senior Note, $1B convertibleSo total Debt issued = $5.7BInitial cost $150M (Cost of $2.2B short term loan - Eye opening) + 3% of $5.2B = $300M+ feesYearly Interest expense:-$550M- $44M (8% interest rate assume given it was pre-covid19)$1B (10.875% note) :- $108M$2.2B (11.5% note):- $266M$1B (9.125% note):- $91M+$1B (4.5% convertible):- $42MTotal Yearly Cost:- $509M.This year cost is $700M+ from just loan.So Even peak time arrived fast (Very unlikely), They would paying 30% of cost to interest on new Loans.Given they have $9B+ long term debt and $2.6B current debt (Mean due in next 12 month) = $12B loans that they have to keep refinancing at higher rate.This mean additional interest cost going to reach nearly $1B by 2024 or half of profit in 2019.Stock is trading at very bad way even with peak sale reached by 2024 (Very optimistic given disaster experience people saw with few cruise ships and no port allowing.) . Given profit reduced by half + over leavarage & debt market dependency concern, It should trade at 60% of $130 Price in 2024 which is $78 (PE is 15 which is very high still). If you discount just 15% (Should 20% given high uncertainty & likely default in competitor lane = pressure on sell price and margin) , in 2020 it should trade $40. at $20% it's $31, If worst scenario play out in next few month, discount can go as high as 30%-35% = $18.This is not growth story, last industry to recover in recovery story, fundamental is very weak, Momentum likely very short lived (USA has 1 week high cases yesterday at 25K)This is oppturnity to exit. Waiting for momentum peak is big mistake because when every one try to exit same time it will drop 10% and then human nature of waiting can make harder for you to decide to exit and end up with regret."
"In time COVID will evade the vaccines. In fact there's a new South African variant that looks like it will evade current vaccines but it's still a bit early to be sure about that. Only a small number of cases in South Africa. Of course Fauci and others are worried about new variants and some experts are saying such new variants are inevitable. When that happens, we'll get a flood of new infections and CDC will have to cancel a lot of travel. We're in the middle of a new wave now and people who have been fully vaccinated are getting COVID. This virus is not going away. RCL and other cruise lines are unlikely to be profitable this year or next. RCL is losing $1 billion a quarter. How long can that go on before they declare bankruptcy. Who will lend to them? The price of this stock is insane consider they've had massive losses for 5 quarters, have issued a lot of new stock to raise money and have borrowed billions."
"Royal Caribbean's Spanish cruise line JV Pullmantur files for reorganizationPublished: June 22, 2020 at 8:14 a.m. ETRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, -6.87% said its Spanish cruise line Pullmantur Cruceros joint venture with Cruises Investment Holding has filed for reorganization under terms of Spanish insolvency laws, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Royal Caribbean's stock fell 1.7% in premarket trading. Royal owned 49% of the JV, and Cruises Investment owned 51%. Pullmantur had canceled all sailings through November as a result of the pandemic. ""Despite the great progress the Company made to achieve a turnaround in 2019 and its huge engagement and best efforts of its dedicated employees, the headwinds caused by the pandemic are too strong for Pullmantur to overcome without a reorganization,"" Pullmantur's board of directors said in a statement. Royal's stock has more than doubled (up 132.1%) over the past three months through Friday, but has lost 58.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.56% has eased 4.1% this year."
"Wake the hell up! Post your total disallowed loss here. Mine for the year is 11 times for a $3,292.69. This is the extra that my brokerage firm is reporting to the government. They are intentionally miss calculating every loss regardless of dates to generate complaints about the ""Pay your fair share tax laws"" from small accounts.What's that you say, you have no ""disallowed losses"", check again are you in for one hell of a surprise come April."
Headed back to $150
I sold at 93$ I’m waiting for it to hit 75-79$ again before I buy 100 shares
"Enter to the ship on your own risk. these are not cruise trip, they are hotels on water and the place to get virus faster then anything . RCL will be 45 dollars soon . sell while you still have some money left . no I am not short . and I am not long either . I never short any stock . the problem is the they keep pumping these stock so they can get your money"
They always take the market up when the worst is in the news. Is this the worst news day?
I get why the airlines and casino stocks are up. They actually have business open but the cruise industry is not making any money right now...
"With Covid cases sky rocketing around the country with no way to flatten the curve again, September sail date is impossible. A vaccine has to be 100% administered and be 100% affective for a floating, close quarters city on the water to ever operate again. Cruise lines might likely be zombie businesses for a really long time"
"There is a vaccine that works against the Covid19 variant. Cruises are coming back and the pandemic is a thing of the past if your vaccinated. The Democrats try to create more fear because they think fear gives them power. Americans are finally waking up and living their lives, and not trusting anything a Democrat says."

"Cruise Lines Under Pressure to Significantly Raise Ticket PricesMarch 06, 2021Cruise ships docked in NassauCruise companies may be eyeing a significant increase to ticket prices in the near future as demand surges and sailings sell out in record time.“Wall Street is not happy,” said one source familiar with the situation. “If cruises are flying off the shelves, the message from big investors has been to raise prices if inventory is selling too quickly … the companies are leaving too much money on the table.”Cruise lines have widely reported strong pent-up demand and record sales volumes in media announcements, leading to a backlash from the investment community.Carnival said sales were solid due to pent up demand in late February, and a few weeks earlier, Oceania saw its world cruise sell out in a single day.Victory Cruise Lines and American Queen Steamboat said that January and February 2021 bookings are over 35 percent higher than November and December 2020 bookings, according to a press release.The story is also good at Royal Caribbean Group, with bookings up 30 percent. $RCL $NCLH"

"ROYAL CARIBBEAN ANNOUNCES GLOBAL VOLUNTARY SUSPENSION OF CRUISINGAt Royal Caribbean International, the safety and well-being of our guests and crew are always our top priorities. After the decision was made on March 13th to voluntarily suspend our sailings departing from US ports, we've now made the decision to also suspend operations for the remainder of our sailings worldwide, effective at midnight, March 15th."
"The CDC is long, while John Hopkins is short. Both reporting wide range of new cases. Do we really know how many cases there are? Have we ever know?"
Norwegian Cancels cruises and the stock goes up. RCL article that says the cash burn might be less at ER and this goes up. RCL downgraded to sell and 55$ price target and this goes up.. Canada cancels all of 2021 and we are up since that news. I wonder what will happen if there is ever good news?
"This $15-20 stock is still trading near $90 after bleeding money for a year and a half?Ridiculous how the price stays propped up, even after they continue to dilute the share total."
Just received and email from Carnival for my upcoming cruise. Even though you are fully vaccinated you have to provide proof of a negative Covid test within 3 days of embark starting on all ships 8/14/21. This is not going to go over well. In addition masks will need to be worn in heavy populated areas like buffets and line for dinner. Not Good. Should see some cancellations come from this
"Passenger on Alaska cruise tests positive for COVID-19, prompting quarantine, canceled sailingOne of the first cruise ships to resume overnight sailing in U.S. waters since the coronavirus shut down the cruise industry this year has reported one case of COVID-19 on board. Passengers are quarantining on UnCruise Adventures' Wilderness Adventurer ""until the State of Alaska deems it safe for them to return home"" after one passenger tested positive, according to a travel alert posted on the cruise line's website. The passenger received a positive test result Tuesday after first testing negative and remains asymptomatic.The ship, now off the coast of Alaska en route to Juneau, according to CruiseMapper, was able to bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's no-sail order because its capacity is less than 250 passengers and crew."
"The stock is ready to rip higher either tomorrow or next Monday and next stop: $97. Lot of bashers, need those as fuel to run high."
BREAK $80 and RCL will fly again!
Let's start reading from Chapter 11 today.
good week for $RCL restarting in Europe and the US with another ships in Europe Harmony of the seas who has the capacity for almost 6k passengers is sailing with only 870 pax.
I think RCL is trading at its best bargain price and I am all in!
"Royal Caribbean CruisesRoyal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is a global cruise vacation company that operates cruise liners. It has four global brands and 61 ships, with another 17 on order as of Dec. 31, 2019.With the coronavirus outbreak in January this year, Royal Caribbean has already cancelled numerous cruises. Last week, the company implemented a ""Cruise with Confidence"" policy that allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours before sailing, along with a full credit on their fare for use on any future sailing in 2020 or 2021 . The policy applies to both new and existing cruises.Though this measure was implemented to assure customers and hold up confidence, it will undoubtedly have a significant top and bottom-line impact on Royal Caribbean in the near-term. President Donald Trump also announced significant travel restrictions from Europe to the U.S. for the next 30 days to control the spread of the virus , and this sudden announcement has further knocked down the stock price of the company to bargain-basement levels.The company has also just announced a 30-day suspension for US sailings due to the ""gravity of the public health crisis,"" further exacerbating its short-term pain. Services are expected to resume April 11. Royal Caribbean's shares have declined by a whopping 77.5% since the start of the year, and are trading at just 3.4 times historical earnings. Though the company will take a massive hit this year due to the cancellations, the stock looks too cheap to ignore if you consider the medium-term prospects.As of Dec. 31, the company had about $2.6 billion of debt due within a year, consisting of $1.2 billion of finance leases and $1.4 billion of commercial paper. Liquidity consisted of $1.5 billion, made up of $243.7 million in cash and $1.3 billion under unsecured credit facilities . The company has also just announced that it has increased its revolving credit capacity by $550 million, and has also reduced capital expenditures and operating expenses to improve liquidity by a further $1.7 billion this year.These actions add up to total short-term liquidity of around $3.75 billion, which is more than sufficient to cover the company's short-term liabilities. As for customer deposits of $3.4 billion, the company can allow customers to defer travel to later dates rather than refunding the bulk of these deposits, thus allowing it more breathing room in terms of cash flow. Royal Caribbean's long-term debt of $8.4 billion has maturities ranging from 2021 through to 2030, and is well-spaced out . Because of the 30-day suspension, the company's cash burn rate should be close to $200 million for the month, but this is still manageable due to the liquidity cushion as mentioned above. After the Covid-19 crisis subsides, people may still be hesitant to go on cruises. The company may, therefore, need to ramp up spending and marketing to get people comfortable again, as well as institute new practices and policies assuring guests that they will be safe on board. These may involve additional operating costs for the company, but should, in the longer-term, be covered by rising revenues as confidence returns with cruises.I believe there is pent-up demand for cruises even though Covid-19 has dealt a stunning blow to the industry. Cruises still offer an idyllic leisure experience and a chance to wind down, away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. This fact should offer investors comfort that the company will still be around to provide guests with great holiday experiences."
Do you guys own all Cruiseline stocks or mainly heavy RCL?
This stocks still up from where I bought it a while ago. So many cruise companies are saying they will have around 80% of their ships sailing by the end of 2021. Royal said they will be cash flow positive early next year (what's that like 4 months away?)I think the investors like inversely glued the algos to covid charts. Well things could get better with covid.
"22 million conservative estimate of virus related jobless claims, probably closer to 25 million in reality. These figures have a major impact on our economy along with business closures for good. Invest cautiously."
"Nice day to recover some money. Yay, leaving for 4 weeks on RCL. Cruising is back. Turn off the news people they have everyone scared."
"Wouldn't Chapter 13 bankruptcy make more sense? Recently Cramer and friends been pumping the cruise stocks just for the friends to be able to dump their shares at higher prices Let's do a simple back of the Napkin calculation:Cash burn: $250M per monthCash on hand: $4.15BDebt: $19.6B @ 11.5%, 5.5% and recently $700M @ 3.5% {Royal Caribbean Group was forced to put up all the ships as collateral}Sailing start: July 2021 @ 70% capacity @ 30% DiscountRevenue till July 2021 = $0.00, Revenue after July 2021:$100M per monthCash Burn till July 2020 = $3B - Interest paid by July 2020 = $1.67BCash on hand by July 2020 = -(500M) {RCL needs to borrow more money or sale more shares}RCL would be profitable by 2040 in ideal situation and only if future Vaccine is effective and if they can stay in business.Analyst put a target price of $30.00Please feel free to correct any of my calculations or assumptions.Now wouldn't Chapter 13 bankruptcy make more sense?"
Royal Caribbean announced today that they will resume cruises in June. It’s only a matter of time until Norwegian and Carnival follows suit. Anyone who owns shares in these three will be happy on Monday!  $RCL $NCLH $CCL

"Have to see how nclh earning go tomorrow. They are all tied at the hip, although with different approaches to returning to cruising."
"Is anyone here buying live data? If so, where from, how much are you paying, what are you getting etc."
"RCL is up and running good. We have been on 3 cruises so far since they opened. 2 ships had covid cases and the people were sent packing. 95% are vaccinated. The people who tested positive were unvaccinated and were children. Royal has contact tracing and they test anyone who was around them. The ships are about 40-50% capacity. RCL is top of the cruise industry. We are leaving for 4 weeks on RCL Sunday, Dont think for one minutes RCL will go bankrupt."
"I have owned $NCLH $CCL $RCL for nearly a year. They currently represent 12% of my portfolio. I continue to hold for the inevitable recovery. Once most people are vaccinated and life returns to normal, these stocks will benefit. All these companies are well run and have managed to remain solvent. Lenders continue to lend to them. Smart $$$ bought in a long time ago (Saudis @ $8 in $CCL). While holding these stocks can try anyone's patience, I can't complain, being up 50%-100% on them already. It is hard to block out the successes that are being had in other stocks, but I'm sticking to my game plan."
I apologize for posting some stupid stuff lately. Here is a more serious question:What is more concerning for RCL stockholders?1. They have no chance of receiving a bail out from the US Government because they are not a US company2. Cruise ships will be the very last thing to open back up3. The core demographic has a mortality rate of over 10% from covid4. They partnered with a German payment processing company to pay their employees. It was just announced last night that this company is missing $2B and has mis appropriated the funds. RCL will still have to re pay their employees and go after the payment processing company. 5. The CDC could care less about the cruising industry and will not put themselves out there to let them start cruising. I guess a global pandemic killing hundreds of thousands of Americans has them preoccupied.6. There biggest competitor CCL just reported a loss that was more than double what was expected7. Even if enough robinhood momentum investors do pump the price up RCL would do a secondary offering to immediately take advantage of the situation and thus dilute the shares back down to $50.
Why is it sinking

This is the first time since the pandemic it that I’ve seen CCL and NCLH sharply outpace RCL Any idea why?
"Someone in this board mentioned about the reality of Chapter 11. Scary. But, looks like the cruise industry is painfully moving towards that point."
"I moved 1,200 shares here to SAVA on Friday and come back here soon. I am stilling holding 1,200 RCL shares and SEPT 17 $85 call."
"COVID cases increased recently due to massive traveling after 163M American got vaccinated, now the number is dropping significantly as expected."
"In extending the ban on Thursday, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said that data collected by the agency shows at least 2,973 Covid-19 infections or Covid-like illnesses as well as 34 deaths came from cruise ships since the CDC started tracking the data earlier this year.“These data have also revealed a total of 99 outbreaks on 123 different cruise ships, meaning that 80% of ships within U.S. jurisdiction were affected by COVID-19 during this time frame,” Redfield wrote in the letter. “In addition, 9 ships still have ongoing or resolving COVID-19 outbreaks on board.”Redfield wrote that current scientific evidence suggests that cruise ships present a greater risk of transmitting Covid-19 than other settings. He cited a study published in the Journal of Travel Medicine that said the basic reproduction rate, a number epidemiologists use to calculate the number of new cases expected from each infected person, was 14.8 aboard the Diamond Princess, one of the first cruise ships to experience an onboard outbreak."
"I wrote two days ago we broke through a major support level.. If we break $90 in a few weeks, we will break $100...Go longs"
"Get ready, RCL is going to plummet. Market is up over 300 points and RCL is up only .45% ... on extremely light volume."
