dropped because they could not require vaccinations and the Delta variant is scaring off older cruisers..
"With the way the covid19 pandemic is spreading, there will be either no sailing or very limited sailing for the next 12 to 16 months. I think anything meaningful sailing activity will most likely have to wait until April of 2022 to resume in a meaningful way. This stigma will be with consumers and cruisers alike for a long time and cannot change consumer behavior overnight. In the meantime, because of the huge overhead and fixed cost that must be paid in order to maintain the cruise ships in working condition, RCL will continue to experience cash burn rate of $280 million per months and similar hit to its equity or enterprise value in that duration. That is $1.17 per share per month or $3.51 per share every quarter, or $14 per share every twelve months. That is 19% to the negative at today's RCL stock price per share of roughly $72.00. If the stock declines or the borrowing costs increase due to credit downgrade, the impact will be even sharper or more significant. If you believe RCL is still undervalued in this kind of situation, your mind is a wonder to behold. But I doubt you can hold onto your capital invested in RCL for too long."
"RCL is up and running good. We have been on 3 cruises so far since they opened. 2 ships had covid cases and the people were sent packing. 95% are vaccinated. The people who tested positive were unvaccinated and were children. Royal has contact tracing and they test anyone who was around them. The ships are about 40-50% capacity. RCL is top of the cruise industry. We are leaving for 4 weeks on RCL Sunday, Dont think for one minutes RCL will go bankrupt."
We have till end of August before delta variant covid will hit globally. Some cruises are bit delayed but will def. cruise in summer months July and August
"I bought RCL @89, @87 @79.55 - Hope to see $100 and beyond in 2021-2022! Best to All"
"I dont think we will see green again till next spring. Why? Delta version of COVID spreading. From end August there will be lockdowns again. I had shares in all 3 big cruises RCL, Norwegian and Carnival and I was bullish but when I saw bearish trend of all cruises and lockdowns that are coming again from end of August, so cruise stocks not OK for now maybe from spring 2022 again. For now im bearish on the cruises. The ones who want to listen, listen. The ones who think cruise stocks will be green again enjoy losses."
$CCL $RCL $DIS
"Think about this for a second: Everyone on board has to be vaccinated and test negative before boarding. They still found 6 people who tested positive. Only one had ""mild symptoms."" But they still ENDED THE CRUISE immedately and sent everyone home from the Bahamas. How is cruising supposed to restart under these conditions? $CCL $NCLH"
Late Surge. DeSantis and Cruise Companies wins court ruling over CDC.
"Enter to the ship on your own risk. these are not cruise trip, they are hotels on water and the place to get virus faster then anything . RCL will be 45 dollars soon . sell while you still have some money left . no I am not short . and I am not long either . I never short any stock . the problem is the they keep pumping these stock so they can get your money"
"Please allow me to elaborate as to why I will short this on Tuesday morning (AZN will release peer reviewed P/1 results tomorrow on their vaccine and RCL will likely jump). Please jump in and let me know what you think. Apart from the obvious reason to short that have been mentioned here time and time again, the below. 1). As I understand it from my DD, the largest customer demographic is the elderly (let's call it retirement age, ranging from 62-66 years of age depending on the nationality). Here lies a deadly problem in that ALL current vaccine trails (all P/1 and upcoming P2/3) are using cohorts 50 years of age or younger with 1 biotech going to a max of 55 years of age. With the above in mind it is safe to assume that the largest customer demographic is out of the picture for the foreseeable future. 2). International travel is and will continue to be greatly impacted, this will not be eliminated without a good reason, being a vaccine. Of course this will loosen up in the near future 2-3 months, but i expect countries will go the way spain is inclining and require a forced quarantine upon arrival (for none nationals or legal residents).3). Caribbean countries are quickly becoming some of the most COVID impacted countries in the world.4). It is unclear to me if RCL has increased their hedge on fuel and to what degree given the current pricing. I am of the idea (no proof) that during this financial crisis they are not taking advantage of the current prices as they are trying to keep afloat. They would need to be somewhere between 50% and 70% hedged for the fuel costs of the next operating year.5). The crew, across all job descriptions, will need to be extremely well monitored and i suspect they will NOT be allowed to go home if working on an operational ship during the end of the year and prior to vaccination. The cost for this will likely be high as RCL will not risk the crew going home and returning to work infected. As many of you know, the lion's share of the crew come from developing countries which are highly impacted by COVID. I am convinced that this stock will settle in the mid to high $30's within the next 2 months and begin a slow steady climb up as they pay down their debt, are allowed to increase passenger capacity and increase operational routes and destinations over the next years. Thank you in advance for your input on the above."
Every metric is now working in RCL's favor. New bookings as at pre pandemic levels. The customer demographic of RCL customs have a vaccination rate over 75%. Zero governmental restrictions. The stock is at a 40% discount from it's all time high.
"I wrote two days ago we broke through a major support level.. If we break $90 in a few weeks, we will break $100...Go longs"
Six passengers on Royal Caribbean ship have tested positive. $CCL $NHCL
Back to $90 soon since vaccine from MRNA works well for newly COVID-19 variant -
"What would be the greatest deception today? Take it up with market up, until 10:30 even with covid raging at 50,000 new per day and 50% of population un-vaccinated. I think this would be the greatest deception and would send a truck load of endorphins to the other Gods brains, especially when they take it back down quickly."
"Interesting, the cdc reports 34,413,532 cases, John Hopkins 34,556,572 casesonly a slight difference of 143,040 cases. Which is correct? or more correct?"
"What I want to know is why don’t RCL comment on how their first paying passenger trip went? They should be top priority news from a PR standpoint. Lack of news is alarming right now, RCL, step up and state the facts."
"With raging pandemic in at least first half of 2021 and by second half of 2021 , 20% to 30% of world population will have at least caught corona virus once and another 20% to 30% will probably get vaccinated. So far so good. This may give you a false sense of confidence that everything will be fine soon enough for the cruise and travel industry. In reality, corona virus impact may last much longer than many investors realize, especially for the travel and leisure industry. Most importantly, having caught corona virus once and having recovered from it once before or getting vaccinated with corona virus does not prevent you from catching a different strain of the corona virus again. Because the corona virus infects easily and mutate quickly, there are now countless different strains of corona virus around the world. It is like the flu virus which cannot be eradicated by vaccination and comes back every year. The cruise industry will start sailing again but will be forced by CDC to operate at half the capacity for at least 12 months and perhaps even years. Even if you assume that RCL will be able to somehow raise ticket prices(which I highly doubt, RCL and other players may even have to initially issue discounts to entice people to get on a cruise), so that you can get to 60% of the $11 billion revenue level that RCL generated in 2019, or $6.6 billion(60% of $11 billion) in their first full fiscal year after resuming operations during covid 19 pandemic, which I believe will be 2022, since RCL will probably resume sailing sometime mid-year in 2021. Below is what RCL's financial results will probably look like in 2022 using a formula derived from numbers from 2019(reported $11 billion revenue) and from 2010(reported $6.7 billion revenue), also adjusting for covid-19 impact such as sailing at 50% capacity.That means the financial statements will look like this in 2022 (first full fiscal year in operation post covid lockdown)2019revenue $11 billion(100%)operating income $2 billion(20%)operating cash flower $1.5 billion (15%)interest expense $409 millionshort and long-term debt $11 billion(short-term and long-term plus current portion of long-term)interest rate 3.7% ($409 million divided by $11 billion)purchase of property and equipment (averaged amount derived from 3 year total purchase divided by 3 year total revenue) $2.3 billionShare price in 2019 between $100 and $120 per share2010revenue $6.75 billion(100%)operating income $802 million(12% of revenue)operating cash flower $1.63 billion (24% or revenue)interest expense $371 millionlong-term debt $9.2 billion(long-term plus current portion of long-term)interest rate 4.0% ($371 million divided by $9.2 billion)purchase of property and equipment $2 billion(29% derived from 3 year total purchase divided by 3 year total annual revenue)Share price in 2010: between $20 and $40 per share2022revenue $6.6 billion(100%, or 60% of 2019 revenue, too optimistic?)operating income $660 million(10% very challenging to achieve due to operating at 50% capacity, nearly impossible to achieve 12% reached in 2010)operating cash flower $858 million (13%, probably wildly optimistic considering 50% capacity but more than 50% staffu?)interest expense $1.1 billion (projected)long-term debt $20 billion(projected long-term plus current portion of long-term)interest rate 5.5%purchase of property and equipment $1.0 billion(16% of 2022 revenue, maybe a little too low??)Projected to grow 30% in 2023(a wild guess, too optimistic?)Share price in 2022 = ???The billion dollar question is how much will investors be willing to pay for RCL per share given the operating metrics and the situation in 2022?My thoughts about the above 2022 projected revenue number is that 60% of 2019 level revenue is highly unlikely to occur in 2022 because that assumes up to 60% of the customers in 2019 will be willing to try cruise again in 2022, how likely is that given that there will probably still be covid-19 spreading around the world in 2022?My thinking is that if in 2010 RCL generated $6.75 billion with better margins, better operating income and cash flow and only $9 billion in debt, then, in 2022 RCL generating lower margins, lower operating income and low cash flow and more than $20 billion or double debt load simply should not be trading above the $20 to $40 per share range in which it traded in 2010, let alone significantly higher than that !!!"
"I own RCL and made a lot of money on this stock. While I believe RCL has some appreciation to go I think there are two issues which suggest that I will be a seller over ensuing months:1- Oil price increases will erode margins at the very time RCL uses steep discounts to attract customers.2. The Delta Virus mutant will emerge in the fall of this year....according to Scott Gotlieb...I believe this fear despite most vaccinated people are immunized against it, will drive RCL lower.Again I own the stock from the deeps of Covid crisis but I will take profits over the next few weeks,"
"Last year i was thinking of putting a small $5k IRA position into a cruise stock, both as an investment and to get the shareholder cruise benefit (100 share min). RCL would have required a lot more $ to buy 100 shares than I was willing to put in. Glad i did not buy then. Looks like the market is coming to me now, I will consider picking up my shareholder benefit min # of shares if I can get them for under $5k (= $50 or less stock price). RCL is probably the best managed of the major lines, although I'm not expecting a huge bounceback here for quite a while, but within a few years it should be riding high again"

earnings is out and all the worst is now behind guys!
Cruises are starting up soon. We are talking money money money for them. Good time to start buying right here before you miss the fast ball.
"Its hard to believe we are headed back to a full lock down and masks. We have went from 11,000 per day to nearly 50,000 per day, when we have close to 4 million vaccines per day. The southern states are not getting vaccinated. I thought the virus was over before the 4th. Now I do not think that it will ever be over, unless the ones posting virus statistics are also shorting the market. From 97 to 70 ="
Boeing is also tanking. That and RCL were my two worst pucks for 2020.
This is the first time since the pandemic it that I’ve seen CCL and NCLH sharply outpace RCL Any idea why?
$CCL $RCL Held their own. Now it’s time for these to start trading on their recent upgrades. New ER will be  to 40
This is very over valued. Won't be surprised if this drops to 40s soon
I’m in so low these drops would do me no good to sell and try to get back in. Just a dip - good luck to all those that buy - I’m along￼￼
"Lots of support to keep stocks where they are. CDC 132 and John Hopkins 135 per day , 000's and not slowing down. Can the other Gods maintain these prices, with these covid numbers? absolutely!"
any company that requires covid vaccine I will avoid..we have to make a stand against the CDC. Give in to them now and they will control our lives forever!!
"Pent up demand coupled with widespread implementation of Covid vaccinations will propel all the cruise lines to higher heights in the coming years. This is a no-brainer, long-term profitable investment. Tough to time the up and down movement of the stock, due to inevitable fluctuations in circumstances and investor sentiment, so swing trading is tricky, but gradually adding on dips and holding seems to be a good strategy here."
Lol. Earning.
RCL BA CVX were down so much yesterday guys which created a best buy in June if you look at the chart.
"Folks, these stocks have a real bankruptcy risk now. One more mutant and cruising will be shut down for another 6 months if not longer. Unclear if they can survive that. If anything it would mean massive dilution, because of newly issued stock to cover the losses. $RCL $NHCL $CCL"
The break even point as it relates to capacity for the newer ships in their fleet is surprising low around 30% and 50% for older ones. Does anyone know what their distancing capacity targets are for current cruises?

"I heard the CEO of another cruise line saying they prefer stricter guidelines on their cruises, this mornings news was good for them, not bad."
"rcl chart, On the 1 year candle chart, right here on yahoo finance, you will see that on Nov6 2020 rcl closed at 58.57. and that very big gap up the next day has not been filled yet, so as we know most all stocks fill the gaps in the chart, it is a a logical place for rcl to stop its down trending stock price. not saying rcl will go down to 58.57, but most stocks do fill the gaps."

RCL, -6.87% said its Spanish cruise line Pullmantur Cruceros joint venture with Cruises Investment Holding has filed for reorganization under terms of Spanish insolvency laws, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Cruise Lines Under Pressure to Significantly Raise Ticket PricesMarch 06, 2021Cruise ships docked in NassauCruise companies may be eyeing a significant increase to ticket prices in the near future as demand surges and sailings sell out in record time.“Wall Street is not happy,” said one source familiar with the situation. “If cruises are flying off the shelves, the message from big investors has been to raise prices if inventory is selling too quickly … the companies are leaving too much money on the table.”Cruise lines have widely reported strong pent-up demand and record sales volumes in media announcements, leading to a backlash from the investment community.Carnival said sales were solid due to pent up demand in late February, and a few weeks earlier, Oceania saw its world cruise sell out in a single day.Victory Cruise Lines and American Queen Steamboat said that January and February 2021 bookings are over 35 percent higher than November and December 2020 bookings, according to a press release.The story is also good at Royal Caribbean Group, with bookings up 30 percent. $RCL $NCLH"
"with FULL FDA approval for Pfizers vaccine we should see more people willing to take the jab, and more trips taken. See you at $90 soon!"
We are hitting the solid bottom here on RCL ($72.55) and IWM ($215) level. No way the big boys can dump the market further!
"I'm going to do a quick post to my fellow retail investors, that are not shills for some hedge group or bots, but just average folks trying to set up a potion. What I've noticed for over a month $NCLH, $CCL, and $RCL, really, all Covid-19 impacted stocks, airlines, casinos, etc, but specifically the cruise stocks have been on a down trend. For the last month, especially the last few weeks, they have been trading on very low volume. $NCLH, whcih I have been watching very carefully, has been acting like it has found strong support around 13 a share, and appears to be re-coupled mostly with the market. Why does it matter?I suspect we're seeing a bottom for these stocks, or somewhere near it, and we're going to see a trend change soon, and it will be on full daily volume. Why? I suspect the downward sell pressure in these stocks are weak retail longs selling off, and not institutional investors. Why are they weak and retail? ...because the drop has been painful, but the pain is short term, and it's mostly retail as institutions still hold close to 90% of these stocks. Why short term? Because Covid-19 cannot physically last forever, based on the data. Why do I say that? ...because I've been watching the numbers. The numbers of cases growing, some of the hotspot states, like Florida, California, even Arizona, appear, to be leveling off. I really don't understand why, if it's legitimate or manipulation, and why it isn't being more talked about in the media. Yes, the overall numbers of cases is bad, it's ...really bad. But it's not ""as bad"" as it was a week ago, or two weeks ago, or three weeks ago in some of the states that are supposed to be out of control. As investors, we trend to recognize these trends. If you don't believe me, just google it for yourself. It's like unemployment, it's bad, but, arguably, it's less bad than it was the week prior, and the week before that. When the cases went down before, we saw a HUGE upsurge in these stocks Covid-19 impacted stocks. Then the cases went up and these stocks started to drop...but now, they are going down again. Again, check yourself, let the numbers convince you. This time, we will have both declining cases and vaccines around the corner, no less than five promising candidates in Phase III human trials with results due Oct/Nov. There's also ENORMOUS political pressure to leak positive vaccine results to the markets before the US election, for obvious reasons. I'm not telling you what to do with you money, and I'm not saying this isn't all ""baked"" in. I don't think it is, as new agencies are just now starting to pick it up. You make your own call. I reposition more heavily in some of these Covid-19 stocks myself. I'm only typing this as it's fun to chat about stocks, but also just in case, it gives some investor out there like me another puzzle piece to add to their own strategy. Hope this helps. Here's a site to start with:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s"
Just received and email from Carnival for my upcoming cruise. Even though you are fully vaccinated you have to provide proof of a negative Covid test within 3 days of embark starting on all ships 8/14/21. This is not going to go over well. In addition masks will need to be worn in heavy populated areas like buffets and line for dinner. Not Good. Should see some cancellations come from this
"The whole cruise lines and airlines stocks are turning around guys, look at RCL BA NCLH CCL UAL SAVE AAL....RCL will snap back to $97 in a hurry, all we need are some good news!"
"The other Gods reset RCL to 67.78 on 7/19 due to covid, thinking that there would be a short increase and then decline. However, the increase is increasing. Its time to reset RCL again."

The vaccinated get the the virus......they need to drop the virus mandates and let the passengers choose risk. The virus will not go away.....we have to move on.

"Someone in this board mentioned about the reality of Chapter 11. Scary. But, looks like the cruise industry is painfully moving towards that point."
Let's be honest here. The types of people that still choose not to get vaccinated don't stray too far from home let alone get on a ship run by people from other countries. $RCL 90 by Aug 13.

Guys; Any news regards to bankruptcy?
Great stock to own buy at $67-$69. Earnings disappointed but too high of expectations. But demand and future looking bright. Delta variant is not gonna impact cruise lines substantially. Maybe slow down things for a couple of weeks to months that’s about it.

This stocks still up from where I bought it a while ago. So many cruise companies are saying they will have around 80% of their ships sailing by the end of 2021. Royal said they will be cash flow positive early next year (what's that like 4 months away?)I think the investors like inversely glued the algos to covid charts. Well things could get better with covid.
Royal Caribbean is up 5.07% to 73.03

"rcl to report earnings Aug 4th, what earnings, there is none, last earnings Negative - 25 dollars a share, they ment to say reporting losses on Aug 4th"
"What happenedCruise line stocks are dropping across the board in Thursday-afternoon trading -- and that just isn't fair.As of 12:35 p.m. EDT, shares of Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) have tumbled 5.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NASDAQ:NCLH) is down 4.2%, and even industry giant Carnival (NYSE:CCL) (NYSE:CUK) is slipping 2.5%. Furthermore, all three of these cruise stocks were down more than 5% in trading earlier in the day.And yet the news isn't all bad.Chart of new COVID-19 cases dated July 9, 2020.NEW COVID-19 CASES REPORTED DAILY THROUGH JULY 9, 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: OUR WORLD IN DATA, A PROJECT OF THE GLOBAL CHANGE DATA LAB 2020. LICENSED UNDER CC BY. CHART COPYRIGHT OUR WORLD IN DATA, A PROJECT OF THE GLOBAL CHANGE DATA LAB 2020.So whatWednesday, as you may recall, representatives from cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise joined forces to form a Healthy Sail Panel taskforce to work out procedures to ensure passenger safety if and when cruise lines are permitted to resume sailing later this year. Not long after this was announced, moreover, it was revealed that the independent auditor in charge of reviewing Norwegian's books found the company's financial position sufficiently improved that it removed a comment expressing ""substantial doubt about NCLH's ability to continue as a going concern.""Granted, that's something of a double negative. But what it means, in effect, is that in the current opinion of its auditor, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings will not go under, will not succumb to the coronavirus pandemic, and will survive to emerge on the other side of this recession healthy enough to remain in business.Moreover, this morning, Carnival subsidiary AIDA Cruises announced that it plans to resume cruising in August -- ahead of the Sept. 15 U.S. restart date previously promised by most cruise lines. Three of AIDA's vessels plan to resume cruising from ports in Germany, each operating under ""a comprehensive set of health and hygiene protocols to help facilitate a safe, healthy and phased-in return to cruise vacations."" They're sailing with an ""adjusted passenger capacity,"" to be sure, and ""without calling at another port"" -- but they're sailing, and that has to be good news for Carnival's revenue stream.Analysts at Wells Fargo promptly more than doubled their price target on Carnival stock to $12 a share.Now whatSo why are cruise stock prices going down today instead of up? Partly, I suspect, this is an effect of the negative macroeconomic news we got today: 33 million Americans are still out of work and unlikely to have the discretionary income to spend on a cruise until they find new jobs. And daily new cases of coronavirus infection continue to edge up both in the U.S. and globally, and the World Health Organization warns that the pandemic is definitely ""not under control"" just yet.And partly, it's an effect of cruise stocks being stocks, period, and thus susceptible to being dragged down when stock market sentiment sours -- as it's doing today, with the S&P 500 down as much as 1%.It's a shame, and it's not fair, seeing as today's cruise news is actually pretty good. But then again, no one ever promised that the stock market would treat you fairly."
"Have to see how nclh earning go tomorrow. They are all tied at the hip, although with different approaches to returning to cruising."
"As I write this, cruise is a little down pre-market, likely due to AstraZeneca pausing it's vaccine trails (temporarily, and out of an abundance of caution) because one participant had an adverse reaction. It's unclear what happened, it may not even have been the vaccine, they will pause until they can investigate, these pauses are a normal part of the process. This is not impacting the timeline of a vaccine, as the two front runners, Moderna and Pfizer, use a different technology and delivery system, and both are up pre-market. AstraZennaca is down less pre-market than some cruise companies$RCL $CCL $NCLH, if that gives an idea at the level of worry. Feel free to invest as you will, of course, but I suspect any momentary dips in cruise will be short lived. Vaccines are still likely landing late November, maybe even October, nothing has changed there. The 15 minute Covid-19 test likely to help restart cruise, and the real game changer, is totally unaffected. If you are long or investing long with the idea that vaccines, testing, and therapeutics will help restart the cruising industry sooner than expected, this pause with one company does not impact or change that strategy, or even hurt it's timeline."

What is the most deceptive move they can make now? Take it up then down at end of day. The next day to the new low but then back up the same day so only day traders can take advantage of the down swing.
They had some interesting insights about RCL on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"Comments from the US Government Coronavirus Task Force this evening March 10th (link to video below):1. Noone from the particularly vulnerable population is going out on a cruise in the near future.2. If someone gets seriously ill on a cruise ship, whether from Coronavirus or another cause, the cost of medical care onboard the ship, airlift evacuation, and land based care will be at the expense of the cruise line.3. The cruise line industry provided Government a proposal today. Government will be reviewing the proposal within the next 24 hours and putting plans in place to ensure the safety of the passengers. They will look specifically at the hardest hit states being Florida, Washington, California, and New York. 4. The last question of the Q & A session was a 2 part question on coronavirus tests and cruise industry potential bailout. The test question was answered but the bailout question was not. 5. They mentioned tax deferrals to assist the hardest hit industries including airlines and cruise lines but the most important focus of the stimulus package is to assist individuals will sick benefits and lost wages.Now it makes sense why RCL and NCLH increased their lines of credit with banks over the past 24 hours.Link to the press conference below (cruise comments start around 4:25 into the video). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k55xdwKJTw"

"The first cruise ship with paying passengers will leave from the U.S. on Saturday, marking the first revenue sail in 15 months and a significant milestone in the COVID-19 recovery for the industry. Celebrity Edge, operated by Royal Caribbean (RCL) subsidiary Celebrity Cruises, will depart Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale — floating on both the ocean waves and widespread hopes that the worst of the pandemic is behind the beleaguered travel industry."
perhaps they can use these ocean polluting floating buffets as scrap metal. these ships are bad for our seas and our planet.
I am surprised to see that the stock is up in after hours trading when they announced a halt to cruising for 30 days. What did I miss?
"$250 easy by Wednesday, my mommy and daddy loves cruises"
"This will drop faster than March 2020, only this time, Chapter 11 will become a reality."
Does Royal Caribbean require proof of vaccination or does it only test negative for Covid?
get ready for the run...
Something very suspicious about this last passenger with covid-19 Laura Angelo. RCL handled it very professionally in the video while she is continuously pointing out she had covid. Who is shorting this stock and supplying the personnel for the theatrics. The SEC may be wondering the same thing.
I heard about RCL the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Cruises may be doing fine, but what is going to be really important is cash on hand in Q2 and especially Q3 income statements. If passengers are paying by cruise credits from previously cancelled cruises, RCL could get into serious cash flow issues."
Problem solved if everyone gets vaccinated.
"This stock collapsed due to the requirement of vaccination for all passengers. Do not worry, we will see green very soon. Hold your shares tight."
This one is going to drop… their new Covid restrictions will decrease future revenue by restricting travel to only those who are vaccinated.
"LOL Who thought about selling when the $RCL cruise had FAUCI-19 positives and now regrets not selling?Not me, because I SOLD! Cruises SHOULD be going up with resumption of service - but they aren't because FAUCI-19 unleashed a new variant and even the vaccinated are getting FAUCI-19. Another shut down might put them under for good. So glad I got off before cruise lines hit the iceberg. $RCL, $NCLH, $CCL all sold off near highs.I like having the breathing room to get back in if I change my mind, but they gonna have to fall a lot further from current prices. Good luck if you re still holding, but I'm making money in other stonks instead of bleeding out on cruise lines."
Rcl just cancelled a cruise out of Australia for April 2022
Let's be honest. It's a miracle that none of the stocks of the big three cruise companies are not below $4/share right now. Keep buying?

I still can’t get the long side argument right now. Can someone please counter these points on the negative side:1) likely no meaningful revenues in 20202) 2021 revenues likely suppressed minimally at the very least3) greatly increased debt levels and therefore interest payments for years to come4) no dividend for years at a min5) increased costs of constant cleaning6) reduced capacities onboard for the foreseeable futureI’m sure there are more so anyone not seeing the positives please add to the list.And longs please counter the argument

"My issue with the cruise industry is that the royal ships all have the green light by the CDC to start test sailings but they are not (or the news isn’t reporting it). If the ships are in compliance why do they keep canceling cruises. April cruises were just canceled yesterday, pushing cruising out until May. They have supposedly had this green light since November or December so what am I missing. This is driving the stock price lower IMO."

Good stocks like RCL BA ABNB NAIL CVX have been down so much guys! Time for us to go up....
You guys have to realize that Royal Caribbean isn’t going down because bad news was reported or their future looks less certain then it did when it was rallying days ago. It simply is too high. I like this stock and it has amazing potential. Cruise stocks are probably the best stocks you can get in the market right now. I was bullish on RCL when it was at $81. And my target price was $98. It didn’t hit exactly $98 but it was around there. I made $1400 without tax. I think this stock will dip to around $83-$85. So I highly recommend buying RCL at that dip range. Norwegian Cruise lines is probably the best cruise stock currently. Don’t buy now I’m warning you. The stock rallied hard to $96 and is gonna dip a little more. Buy when I said too and you will make money not only long term but shoet term

The question is will covid affect the cruise lines with 1/2 the population vaccinated and 4 million new vaccinations every day? The other Gods will decide for us."
Who’s buying puts lol
"What deception shall we see today? I predict that the Other Gods will be piling out of RCL as the price is extremely high for 70,000 new cases from John Hopkins and 80,000 new cases from CDC. Or the truly deceptive/evil would be to go on to even highs regardless of covid while RCL dumps their own shares."
Israel recently reported that Pfizer vaccine effectivness dropped to only 64% with spread of the Delta variant.
"There is a vaccine that works against the Covid19 variant. Cruises are coming back and the pandemic is a thing of the past if your vaccinated.

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A passenger aboard a Royal Caribbean ‘cruise-to-nowhere’ from Singapore has tested positive for COVID-19, forcing around 2,000 guests to be quarantined in their cabins and the Quantum of the Seas ship to return to dock on Wednesday."

Comparing peak in Israel in January data without vaccination to data from Aug 8th, probability of getting hospitalized is very much comparable. Despite having 85% adults vaccinated."

"Rick Munarriz from Motley Fool is bashing the cruise industry again because he thinks they topped out. ( probably because hasn’t got his deposit back from the cruise line that he bashed all winter long) He also says that they are having a lot of trouble getting started, contraire Rick, RCL has been sailing in Europe for months and was the first to get CDC full approval to set sail already this month. I believe maybe he missed the boat (pun intended) and wishes the stock prices come down so he can bag a sweet deal, we all know the CDC is going to fully open cruising again very soon with the rest of the nation going back to normal. Our government knows we need to get back to normal asap to become one of the most prosperous nations to emerge from this pandemic, we can do with less of the likes of decent from people like Rick to get a positive attitude moving forward and back to a stronger and brighter future."
This stock popped when the news about the vaccine came out. Then as people got vaccinated it continued to run. There's an old saying bye and the rumor sell on the news what you're seeing now is a company that needs more good news. What that type of news will be I'm not sure there's still a lot of bad mixed in to the price of the stock

"Travel sector wants to go back to green today. The people are over the fear mongering and will learn to live with Covid, and will be treated as any other flu. Just a matter of time before vaccinations and herd immunity takes the world back. There's no reason to think travel sector stocks won't go back to pre-pandemic levels. Get in while you can."
"With Covid cases sky rocketing around the country with no way to flatten the curve again, September sail date is impossible. A vaccine has to be 100% administered and be 100% affective for a floating, close quarters city on the water to ever operate again. Cruise lines might likely be zombie businesses for a really long time"
I closed my long position on RCL the day they restarted operations and opened up a short position the next day primarily for two reasons. The more ships leave port the more cash they will hemorrhage and invariably there will be more positive COVID passengers which will keep feeding this negative cycle of events. I’m not sure what the long story is here but I’d love to hear it.
"Someone against the vaccine said that there are less deaths. A $83,000 hospital bill is a financial death. Even if you just pay half $41,500 would be hard for me to swallow, just to say I stand for freedom and I am unvaccinated."

Given profit reduced by half + over leavarage & debt market dependency concern, It should trade at 60% of $130 Price in 2024 which is $78 (PE is 15 which is very high still). If you discount just 15% (Should 20% given high uncertainty & likely default in competitor lane = pressure on sell price and margin) , in 2020 it should trade $40. at $20% it's $31, If worst scenario play out in next few month, discount can go as high as 30%-35% = $18.This is not growth story, last industry to recover in recovery story, fundamental is very weak, Momentum likely very short lived (USA has 1 week high cases yesterday at 25K)This is oppturnity to exit. Waiting for momentum peak is big mistake because when every one try to exit same time it will drop 10% and then human nature of waiting can make harder for you to decide to exit and end up with regret."

"$CCL $RCL $NCLH People aren’t understanding the buyback. shareholders who sold didn't. Official Statement:Raising capital to return to shareholders?At first glance, what Carnival announced on Monday seemed completely in line with what we've seen before throughout the cruise industry. The company reported it would sell about $500 million in stock in just the latest of many capital raising moves that investors have seen since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020.Most investors didn't look any further, seeing the decision as a sign of weakness that once again reminded everyone of the extensive cash burn that cruise operators have had to endure during their long period of inactivity. Indeed, other cruise companies also gave up ground on the day, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) both falling more than 6%.But if you look at Carnival's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you'll find..... the truth!"

"Royal Caribbean CruisesRoyal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is a global cruise vacation company that operates cruise liners. It has four global brands and 61 ships, with another 17 on order as of Dec. 31, 2019.With the coronavirus outbreak in January this year, Royal Caribbean has already cancelled numerous cruises. Last week, the company implemented a ""Cruise with Confidence"" policy that allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours before sailing, along with a full credit on their fare for use on any future sailing in 2020 or 2021 . The policy applies to both new and existing cruises.Though this measure was implemented to assure customers and hold up confidence, it will undoubtedly have a significant top and bottom-line impact on Royal Caribbean in the near-term. President Donald Trump also announced significant travel restrictions from Europe to the U.S. for the next 30 days to control the spread of the virus , and this sudden announcement has further knocked down the stock price of the company to bargain-basement levels.The company has also just announced a 30-day suspension for US sailings due to the ""gravity of the public health crisis,"" further exacerbating its short-term pain. Services are expected to resume April 11. Royal Caribbean's shares have declined by a whopping 77.5% since the start of the year, and are trading at just 3.4 times historical earnings. Though the company will take a massive hit this year due to the cancellations, the stock looks too cheap to ignore if you consider the medium-term prospects.As of Dec. 31, the company had about $2.6 billion of debt due within a year, consisting of $1.2 billion of finance leases and $1.4 billion of commercial paper. Liquidity consisted of $1.5 billion, made up of $243.7 million in cash and $1.3 billion under unsecured credit facilities . The company has also just announced that it has increased its revolving credit capacity by $550 million, and has also reduced capital expenditures and operating expenses to improve liquidity by a further $1.7 billion this year.These actions add up to total short-term liquidity of around $3.75 billion, which is more than sufficient to cover the company's short-term liabilities. As for customer deposits of $3.4 billion, the company can allow customers to defer travel to later dates rather than refunding the bulk of these deposits, thus allowing it more breathing room in terms of cash flow. Royal Caribbean's long-term debt of $8.4 billion has maturities ranging from 2021 through to 2030, and is well-spaced out . Because of the 30-day suspension, the company's cash burn rate should be close to $200 million for the month, but this is still manageable due to the liquidity cushion as mentioned above. After the Covid-19 crisis subsides, people may still be hesitant to go on cruises. The company may, therefore, need to ramp up spending and marketing to get people comfortable again, as well as institute new practices and policies assuring guests that they will be safe on board. These may involve additional operating costs for the company, but should, in the longer-term, be covered by rising revenues as confidence returns with cruises.I believe there is pent-up demand for cruises even though Covid-19 has dealt a stunning blow to the industry. Cruises still offer an idyllic leisure experience and a chance to wind down, away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. This fact should offer investors comfort that the company will still be around to provide guests with great holiday experiences."

Since the cruise ship stock keep selling its shares to cover its losses.....will there be any equity in these stocks if this continues?
Reopened a short position here. It’s outlandish to reward a stock for uncertainty and a huge loss that is likely to last for >6 months.
is it true that only vaccinated people are allowed to go on Royal Car. cruises ?
"In extending the ban on Thursday, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said that data collected by the agency shows at least 2,973 Covid-19 infections or Covid-like illnesses as well as 34 deaths came from cruise ships since the CDC started tracking the data earlier this year.“These data have also revealed a total of 99 outbreaks on 123 different cruise ships, meaning that 80% of ships within U.S. jurisdiction were affected by COVID-19 during this time frame,” Redfield wrote in the letter. “In addition, 9 ships still have ongoing or resolving COVID-19 outbreaks on board.”Redfield wrote that current scientific evidence suggests that cruise ships present a greater risk of transmitting Covid-19 than other settings. He cited a study published in the Journal of Travel Medicine that said the basic reproduction rate, a number epidemiologists use to calculate the number of new cases expected from each infected person, was 14.8 aboard the Diamond Princess, one of the first cruise ships to experience an onboard outbreak."

"All the back seat QB’s and msnbc analysis that never leave the room which pretend to know about the cruise lines, I have first knowledge from just returning from a Royal Caribbean cruise. NO ISSUES and everything was perfect. The only issue that I and most others can see is the scare tactics being used with this virus which will eventually result in all businesses having some sort of failure. Keep listening to these politicians scare tactics to stay home or stay closed or government medical professionals working with the current administration and all cruise line will have to file protection not because of the virus. Hats off to Royal Caribbean and your entire team. You were all amazing on the cruise"
"We are currently having a global pandemic of the Covid-19 virus.Cruise ships have shown themselves to be very efficient disease incubators, both in the past with norovirus outbreaks, and recently with the disturbing spread of the Covid-19 virus on the Diamond Princess in Yokohama Bay. Multiple ports in the West Pacific have closed down and are refusing to allow scheduled visits by cruise ships. In an effort to deal with this emerging problem, the cruise ship industry has cancelled some scheduled cruises in the West Pacific and has also locked out travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau on all of their cruises. As the geographic range of the virus increases, these measures are becoming inadequate. Ultimately, I'm thinking that the cruise lines will have to completely shut down operations for some period of time. There are 3 publicly traded cruise line companies: Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL), and Norwegian (NCLH). I've had a look at the balance sheets for each of them and have found a very troubling commonality. To wit, the business model for cruise lines dictates negative working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) with no liquidity reserve. Each of these companies is entirely dependent upon current cash flow to meet their current obligations. It looks like it is normal for them to live on the edge of a financial cliff. If they are forced to suspend their operations, their illiquidity could quickly turn to insolvency and perhaps even bankruptcy. This is VERY BEARISH.For full disclosure, I have purchased put options for all 3 of these companies."
May see GREEN today guys!RCL SAVA will rise from here!
Federal judge has just over ruled Florida on vax requirements.
"weak day for the travel sector, although it appears to have found the bottom, and 79 proved to be strong support. It may not get back to the green today, but promising support looks like another leg up is inevitable."
"""Total revenue was negative $33.7 million"" ...lol... seems like there are some accounting corrections even on revenue reported previously ;)"
I tried to tell you for a year now the stock would collapse when they actually started to sail- now they have to show profits and of course that will never happen as the industry is crippled
"Where rcl could be going, looking at the rcl chart, we can see on the weekly chart of rcl there is a very big gap on the chart the week of Nov 2, Most all stocks go back to fill the gaps so rcl has a very good chance to go back to 60.32 to fill that gap,"
"Is this back to $20 yet? That’s what it should be, and where it was after the Covid closures hit.They alienated 58% of the country by requiring vaccines (as only 42% of the country is vaccinated)This sinking turd has been kept afloat by bs and puff piece news articles. Prepare for the crash and burn!"
Closed out my short position on this today. My timing is typically poor so I can only assume things get worse for the longs in the short term. Good luck to all…Crazy Ivan out.

"There are times to buy the dip, but buying the dip when there are signs the industry could be shut down again is maybe not the best idea. I bought in during the FAUCI-19 crash but sold in the high 80s. Bought some AMC and filled out a few other positions.Never made an options play, You can check my post history. I may buy in if things go really bad, but I am so glad I bailed on my cruise line stocks when I did."
"So, no comment on the extra ONE BILLION Dollar debt they are taking on. This will sink before it swims again."
Gapping up almost 2% in the premarket
"You guys , I don't see cruise will be up and running even in 2021. I think 2022 the very earliest. I do marathon distance and my race was in May 2021 in MI. Yesterday, I got an email they canceled that already. Look at the wordings they use. I will paste here:Dear 2021 Bayshore Registrants,The Traverse City Track Club announces that the 39th annual Bayshore Marathon, Half Marathon and 10K will be converting to a virtual event. Please see below for your options.“TCTC has been monitoring developments in the running event industry, and following the guidelines of local, state and national authorities, medical advisors, volunteers, participants and community partners as we continue to work through the pandemic. We did not take the decision to cancel the traditional in-person event lightly,” said Lisa Taylor, executive director of Traverse City Track Club.“MDHHS orders will be our primary guide. I do not suspect restrictions being lifted until we are post-pandemic, meaning we have achieved herd immunity and minimal new cases. Vaccine production, distribution and acceptance could exceed expectations but it is unlikely.” Dr. Jim Zeratsky, Event Medical Director."
Cruise lines are sailing again . . . Why are cruise lines down about 20% over the past 30 days? This market is nuts!
I loaded 30 AUG $75 STRIKE and 3K shares as well near $72.55!
"Has anyone ever noticed the volumes, Friday evening 8/6/21 2.9 million, Today 8/8/21 4.4 million? More trading is done after the market closes than when the market is open. Exact volume and price data is never shown."
The Israel research on the booster shot is fabulous.. I've owned all 3 cruise stocks for 13 months.. CNBC talking about full approval for Pfizer by FDA
Are we heading to $90 next week??? Very likely if you look at BA and CVX!
$69 - $89 range last 30 days so RCL will settle around $79 in next 7 days!
Best thing I saw today was a video of the Quest sailing out of Scotland getting ready for their first cruise in 18 months.

RCL's feeble attempt to allow only vaccinated passengers to board the the ship...The insurance is a stick....not the carrot for the passenger to decide what is best to....cost of insurance v. free vaccination.....no brainer for most.....roundabout way to get only vaccinated on board...
"I worked for Royal Caribbean and on other lines between 1997 and 2002.After 09/11/01 RCL dipped to $9 a share and in 02 recovered to $20 by 03, $30 by 04, and $40 by 05.After 2008 it dipped to $06 in 09 and recovered to $35 and by 2014 it was trading in the $50 range. It reached highs of $135 in 2018.In 2014 I was trading the stock between 60 and $70 but it got away from me.I’m going long now because I know this is the company that has beaten it’s way back in to profitability after 911, after the financial crisis in 2008, and after the Zika scare.Back at the turn of the century seven day cruise’s typically had just one sea day. Look at the itinerary for the RCL ships now. They have two sea days and sometimes even visits to two private islands in the Caribbean. This means the company has gotten really good at generating revenue on board and on its islands. Do your due diligence and see how many cabins are available in May. Not many. Soon you will likely see CEO Richard Fain start buying stock like he did back in 2014. This stock is way over sold in my humble opinion."
$RCL $SPY $CCL Here comes Delta. 5x the cases in US yesterday. 
"Nancy and I were looking at the RCL price and I just had to say, there you go again, bought more at a discount and will use the coming 20% gain to buy fencing for the ranch."

"$CCL $RCL $NCLH According to data from the Washington Post, new daily cases in the United States have risen by 14.8% over the past 7 days, however new daily deaths still fell by 0.7% over the past week, and COVID-related hospitalizations fell by 4.7%. Delta variant is clearly not causing more deaths and certainly NOT causing more hospitalizations. There are currently 30 cruise ships on the water as I write this and zero have reported COVID outbreaks. Let’s move on. Wear mask indoors and live your lives."
