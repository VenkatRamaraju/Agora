Do you guys own all Cruiseline stocks or mainly heavy RCL?
"Cruise left Los Angeles, today at 60% capacity. How can they make money at 60%?"
"We will be wearing masks and taking shots for the rest of our lives.Similar to movie theaters, the cruise industry is dead. Businesses that are population-dense will not survive the next 12-18 months."
As all the cruise operators just announced launching all virtually all of their boats by summer/2022 my bet is pricing is going down. In Q2 they all reported solid pricing because only a fraction of their boats were active.
"tourist restrictions will be lifted world wide starting NOVEMBER guys, so RCL NCLH + airline stocks will do well again. UBER LYFT ANBN are ahead of us!"
RCL CEO on CNBC. Fluff interview. Anyone else smelling equity issue next week?
RCL Covid testing positive is far more prevalent than one can find on Google. Are cruislines paying to suppress news reporting Covid cases?Here is one video on RCL cases: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnnF_0GkGrw
"Q3/2020 - cruise ban - net loss 1.34 billionQ3/2021 - cruises allowed, extreme after-COVID demad as often reiterated by CEO - net loss 1.42 billion"
"Booking comment is WEAK. ""Bookings in 2022 back to historical levels"" That's it? Only 65% of capacity available for bookings. What happened to huge pent-up demand? Far less people want to cruise vs. going to a beach resort. RCL burned cash as expected (cash balance down). More burning for the moths ahead. My guess is RCL will want to raise more equity just to de-risk the balance sheet, now bloated with debt. They can't afford a Virus surge that may be better at evading vaccines when winter hits. Better out some more cash on balance sheet."
RCL shoudn't wait until after they report Q3. They could really use another $2B of equity and share price more than high enough to reduce balance sheet risk. They should have taken advantage of the pop in cruise stocks after MERCK announced Covid pill. RCL did not provide a cash burn guidance for Q3 - only to say cash burn going up due to cost of reactivating boats. And cruises are at half capacity so not making much money. They may prove to have made mistake not raising equity in recent days.
I sold at 93$ Iâ€™m waiting for it to hit 75-79$ again before I buy 100 shares
Travel ban for tourists will end on 11/8 guys so RCL BA ALK UAL LUV DAL have just started rising after 2 down weeks.
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while RCL barley does anything at all."
"RCL halts a Hong Kong cruise to nowhere cruise due to 1 suspected case from a crew member. Clearly, Asia will have far more strict rules as Hong Kong and China have ""Covid Zero"" policies. But clearly there are cases on U.S. cruises, but are not talked about (unless we see a large outbreak in a boat). Most passengers infected onboard will have left the ship so cruise companies will do anything to avoid mandatory testing before debarkation. Hide the truth (that you can get super spreader events on cruises - just that the super spreading occurs when say a group of passengers then go home to spread it there). They should require mandatory testing before getting off the ship and then we will know just to what extent people would get infected on cruises - especially as supposedly all tested negative before boarding."
"My guess is RCL will do an equity issue after releasing Q3. They are gonna burn billions more before they can get to cash flow neutral (at the corporate levels - cruise line operators talk about cash flow positive at ship level, but that excludes the mountain of costs related to running the business like land-based costs/marketing and maintenance CAPEX). Cruise stocks popped on initial Merck news and now pulled back. RCL wished the initial Merck news happened around their Q3 report. Only getting tiny lift on more Merck news. We will see if I will be right or not."
Anyone else signing up for the 274-day around-the-world cruise?Starting at only $58K/person
Cruise booking for 2022-203 are increasing and many of them are fully booked... RCL stock will be back to $100+ soon..
This cruise stock has potential unlike Carnival corporation. Rcl will stay afloat.
"historical data from last 4 quarters showing a big jump right after earning report, let see on Oct 22...Bullish"
"I see opportunity for the older ships. Instead of selling off older ships, change the passenger. Introducing RCL Cargo. Contract out with corporations exclusively. You can fit a ton of Apple/Nike/Walmart products on a cruise ship. To the point where it is profitable to keep the older ships going. Corporations need to work out the logistical aspects, but it's probably cheaper than to pay the outrageous prices that cargo companies charge and have it sit in the port of Los Angeles for weeks."
