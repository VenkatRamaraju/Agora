"5% OF THE ENTIRE MKT. CAP HAS TRADED. and not a word from this terrible mgmt., team, forget if the deal is good or bad, this CEO must be a 2nd grade drop out ,especially if he doesn't make a statement"

"ALLY is one of my greatest value investments ever. Bought this stock several years ago at a dirt cheap price, however even at these prices the stock is still cheap. Currently have a 187 percent return. ALLY is Bill Nygren of Oakmark's favorite stock. Lots of financials are bargains right now, but ALLY is one of the few that has generated massive capital returns. This stock moves slowly and steadily. I am fully convinced $60 a share or more is in ALLY's future for patient investors."
Probably better to invest in their 8% 11/1/31 cbond rather then their actual stock at the moment.
ALLY is the one bank stock that hasn't let me down this year. I have a huge gain on them while the rest of the regional banks are still in the toilet. Very bullish on this company.
Ally Financial is up 4.92% to 51.35
started a small position for some safe money. plan to hold until atleast $38
I read in an article that ally has 181.9 billion in assets. Why is it only worth 19 billion?
Continuing to March higher. The 30s will soon be history. ALLY still very undervalued even at these levels.
Looks like a beat on both eps and rev?
ALLY looks at least 15% undervalued right here going in to earnings. Stock goes to low 30s this year...
"Everyone is waiting for a vaccine for the virus. While that will be huge for the markets, an effective medical treatment protocol for the vaccine would be the first step towards normalization. If the treatment can get the mortality rate down to the common flu, then things could ramp up at a moderate pace. This treatment will come much sooner than the vaccine. Watch the mortality rates, the press isn't focusing on this."

Ally Financial Stock Gets a Lift From Buyback News....nearing 52 week high.....go ALLY!!!
"Excellent CD, savings and checking rates. Ally is poised to go higher. Would not be surprised to see it be acquired."
"Revenue and EPS have been growing. My sense as a customer is that this bank is well put together. They have one of the websites I've seen in terms of UI and functionality, and they offer a compelling mix of investment products. I see continued growth ahead."
ATH today at $46.70 Just a great pandemic rally stock with a dividend. My cost basis is $17.70
Thank you Ally. Bought March $28 call options for $1.10 yesterday and sold them today for a quick double. When market overreacts you have to take advantage. Holding March calls longer with market down today and a double in hand would just be greedy.
Anyone know why this keeps going down?
They reported losses and high costs but stock is up 11 %....makes perfect sense.
The good news is Ally’s growth has primarily come from diversifying their credit lines outside of the auto industry severely reducing their dependence on it.
I haven’t gone anywhere.. I expect people to hop on board again tomorrow after another earnings surprise
Wait until there is some mention of Bitcoin with Ally. We will get a whole other class of investors/speculators. The question is..........when will that come. Digital bank with Digital currencies.
"Ally beats on top and bottom line by a ton and the stock goes down. Earnings reports mean nothing anymore. The stock market moves around on whims, news m, fantasies etc."
"Look at the options activity today. Heavy volume on Feb's 41 calls. Premiums declining all day as the share price dips on average volume. So this is bearish, someone selling call options. So the news tomorrow is bad or players are hedging a Ally position. Thoughts?"
Ally might be a good company but their mobile trading app is BY FAR the worst. It is painful to use. Will be transferring my account as soon as I can. ETFC far superior.
WE ARE ALLY! Home insurance here we come!
What’s going on? It’s been doing really well this year
Any thoughts (ALLY) (Banking) and (ETFC)(Broker) Merger?Boosts Both Areas For both.
anyone here from Sain
"Long time customer and shareholder. It’s a good business, but Ally Invest failed miserably this past week. The fallout is not going to be good. Lots of folks are going to move to more stable banking and investing platforms that actually work when you need them most (Fidelity)."
"$ALLY Now trades at a 12 month trailing P/E ratio of 6.599 based on yesterday's close!!! Stock is so undervalued!!! If it traded at the average P/E ratio of BOA, WF, JPM & COF, which is an average P/E ratio of 10.9225, that would put ALLY at $79.41 if P/E ratio was 10.9225!!! 61% undervalued based on yesterday's close of $47.98!!!"
Was considering buying at $19 :(
"the President of Ally sold 4,125 shares on Sept 1, that's 1.9% of their total shares. the market is reacting to that news"
Apparent good news are in Insurance which shows low losses and Mortgage which shows lower loan losses than in prior period. Hard to believe in this economy but will see if loan del support those low loss numbers
I sold out today with a 190 percent gain
I came in hight but those big dips never really came and just kept going up. So im in and ready to buy on any dips
Boom! This stock has been a sleeper for years. Finally getting the recognition it deserves.
I got in today at 14.08
I find it really difficult to determine fair value with ally right now. Could easily trade down to half what it is now depending on macro market and economy risks...or it’s a deal.
Anyone know how the drop in stock price factors in to recent acquisition paid with stock?
Thoughts on earnings tomorrow ? Do you think ALLY is beating both EPS & Revenue expectations or neither ?
This is a good buy IF you plan to hold long term. They have been around and will continue to exist. Will people not need financial help in an online format in 4 years? 1 years? This will go back to 30 at some point in the future
"First day with ally 150 shares, not bad"
Bill Nyugen was on CNBC recently when this stock was $21. I bought some. It kept going down. I just averaged down buying my last shares at $12 a share. Short term disaster. But the yield is fantastic and thought more people would use the net for banking. Today the stock is above $24 and 'probably' more customers than pre-Huwan Chinese virus. Would not be surprised if this stock goes beyond its high this year and over $40 a share. Well run company and positioned to get stronger going forward.
Ally Financial reached an all time high at 37.07
I agree with Ally's web site needs to be improved.
FYI deal details slides https://s2.q4cdn.com/753234398/files/doc_presentations/2019/02/Ally-Financial-Announces-Agreement-to-Acquire-CardWorks-2020.pdf
looking for this to get back to 51.50-52 to get back in
"Ally's auto biz could soon be going out of business while they continue to use regular US Mail to send and lose Car Titles that are paid off. While eBay sellers can't do business on their platform without sending tracking info, even on low priced items, Ally does not track such important documents like Car Titles sent by regular mail. While they save a couple bucks on these shipments without tracking, they put their company at risk when USPS takes too long or loses the car title in the mail. Ally believes car titles are less important that something cheap on eBay. Sell, Sell, Sell while this wing of Ally sinks."
"I have several types accounts with Ally (checking, CDs, Savings) and it's an easy bank to move money around, get good rates, etc."
everyone loves this bank its rated number one for multiple different categories.. It just put out a cash back credit card which i am sure they will expand on and they are rated number one for interest rates in savings (no minimum BTW). if you look up on google the best place to start trading you cant find any results with out ally on the top 5.. Almost all reviews or top 5 or 10 list rank it number 1 or 2 aside with TD for trading and yes they are deep in car loans and Americans are always going to be buying cars for at least a couple more decades.. They even have the highest interest checking accounts available with no fees or penalties if you overdraft they just punish you by making your mobile deposits take 5 days.. anyways my point is even Ive been with ALLY for almost 5 years now and I pretty much love everything about this entire company and SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE THAT REVIEWS THEM!! Yet no on body seems to be satisfied with the stock value and it seems like its should have been steady climbing and even JUMPING NOW. remember the market is low..and also i forgot i really don't like that you cant deposit cash into the same ATMS that you can take money out of and they have no locations but that saves them tons of money so i am okay with it a a share holder. i guess i also really don't prefer to invest and don't like trading stock with them either.. If i was rich i may not mind but there are some hidden fees and i don't make big enough trades and i trade to often to pay them along with the 4.95 per. plus the software isn't informative or that great but you can connect it to Yahoo..CAN ANYONE TELL ME THE HOLD UP OR THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T #$%$ THIS STOCK UP?is it lack of sustainability?
Is it too late to get in on this stock? Can we reach $40?
"Sold, 1500 shares at 14.5 a few months ago. Thanks for the ride, was expecting to hold for a few years, made more than I expected in a few years in less than a quarter."
"ALLY gets huge eps from their internet brokerage division , 1000's of $4.95 trades every day, just buy every day collet a great dividend and the stock will be over $40 in a year"
Just checked my brokers consensus earnings estimates and see they have been raised to $7.63 for 2021 and dropping to $6.78 for 2022. I suspect a few analysts have not updated their numbers yet so these may go up over the next few days. That puts the current PE ratio at 6.85 which is unbelievable low given how they keep massively beating the estimates. On the earnings call the CFO seemed extremely confident that they would be able to maintain a very high net interest margin going forward. I suspect that is due to both the continued reduction in their own cost of funds via refunding high cost debt and having a growing percentage of the funds coming from their very cheap sources of funds due to almost no interest being paid on deposits. The other thing to think about is how the market is going wild on so called Fin-Tech stocks yet ALLY is by the best online bank and gets zero credit for that. This stock is wildly underpriced even after rising substantially over the past year. It does not help that next years earnings estimates are below the current but I suspect this is because some the analysts are being overly conservative. With the massive stock buyback that will push up the EPS and as noted their cost of funds continues to drop due to refinancings and growing low cost accounts. They most certainly will have another leg up when the market begins to acknowledge these strengths.
"Ian confused about this til. Many people on this board say that the service is terrible, but the earnings are great and many analysts have it as a strong buy. Who is right?"
"Thanks goodness the merger with the Credit Card company was called off!! Less dilution, less risk of losses on their portfolio. It removes a major risk, one the market did not like."
Sweet wanted an entry point into this one!
Curious why this is down again today when entire market up and rebalancing end of month pension money etc?
Withdrawing all my cash . Why have an online only bank for a high yield savings if there’s no longer interest . This is terrible .
"I recommend anyone with IRA brokerage accounts with Ally Financial check their account balances. It sounds like Ally may have been caught up as a middleman in this Game Stop mess. It has been reported to me by relatives that on the day of the ""tech outage"" their IRA accounts were showing 50% and 75% lower account funds, even though the relatives were in buy and hold positions and had not traded in their IRA accounts. My relatives have yet to be made whole by Ally regarding what their account balances were on 1/27/21.If Ally raided IRA brokerage accounts of parties who held no exposure to Game Stop stock or options, this is a Security and Exchange rules violation. A fiduciary cannot move money from accounts who were not party to any Game Stop transactions. Please correct me if Ally is not a fiduciary....they do house IRA retirement accounts. Where is the protection for consumers' IRA retirement account money?Call me a skeptic. I do NOT believe that this was simply a ""technical glitch"" at Ally. That is far too convenient as an excuse when money disappears from IRA accounts when the account owners did not take IRA withdrawals or place trades that resulted in losses."
Nice almost 4% increase today...glad I bought in yesterday :o)
I'm buying thanks for the dip
I wouldn’t sell a share at this point. One of the most consistently undervalued stocks. Great growth trajectory
Three years holding this stock waiting for it to get to mid 30's and when it is finally almost there it pulls this BS move. Beyond mad!
"NEW: Wells Fargo, one of the biggest lenders for new and used car purchases in the U.S., sent letters to hundreds of independent auto dealerships last month telling them that the bank was dropping them as a customer, sources tell CNBC."
"Approaching 52 week highs in a pandemic. Now if Congress could pass a stimulus bill before the end of the year, more bullish news for ALLY. Another conference w Ally on Dec 8th. Lets see what they say about consumer creditworthiness and possible loss reserve reductions."
Time to sell my call options for a loss I guess....??Hurray......

Ally is an EPS machine. Can't wait to see their 2Q results
"Why is there no mention of Ally locking out people accounts two days in a row, during a market correction and while their stock is increasing? This is clearly market manipulation and favoritism. They are just asking for a class action lawsuet."
Congrats to Richard and the rest of you that were in before it was cool 
Great quarter! Shares go much higher from here...
solid earning
30 by Halloween.
Let me into my account!!
"I thought Ally looked like a good investment and it maybe but I have had enough pain, I'm out. It has been down 6 out of 7 days since I bought. Better lose a little than lose a lot. So long and good luck."
"Ally Financial warned its shareholders of looming auto loan problems in a different way. In its detailed look at the first quarter, it noted that its auto finance division's pretax bottom-line number had fallen by $502 million year over year, shifting from profitability to a $173 million loss, ""primarily due to higher provision for loan losses associated with reserve build given COVID-19 forecasted macroeconomic changes."""
Nice report. This is one of my picks for 2018. I see $42 by years end.
"Agreed, check out ENVA and you’ll discover another winner with a 3 PE"
"ALLYs got a truly strong balance sheet, competitive advantage in online banking, and is significantly undervalued. Strong cash flow growth as well. Stock Will fly"
Healthy pull up I think we will see new ATH very soon again. Great company great cash flow great earnings and growth
"With BAC reporting record profit, ALLY should rise today ."
Past 13 months have just been exceptional. Just almost steady increases every week every month. Brief sell off after last earnings but since just continual climb. Under accumulation.
C'mon Ally....go commission free too or else I'm going to Schwab.
One of my best stocks
i like Ally but dont forget it's essentially an auto lender. I don't think the current price is all that attractive compared to an index fund given the risk. I've had a great experience as a bank customer. #$%$ experience as an investor with Ally invest. Never had an auto loan...
"Kilpingers magazine latest issue just rated Ally as the ""Best internet bank""."
"John, you called $50 by the end of April, two months ago. What is your next prediction?"
"This is a money maker here, already up on a good note.. more to come. My advice, do your DD and be strategic .. the reward will come!!"
"I havent been following this one very closely because it has done quite well since I bought it on June 26, 2020...at $18.75. There seems to be a bit of a stall, or maybe Im just looking too closely. I know some of yall know everything. Is it a keeper?"
"Incredible earnings report, this stock is so undervalued after a beat like that. It should be at 85.00 per share easy."
People who think the price will go to $12 are really out of touch with reality. What are you smoking. The New Normal is here and that is online banking.
Ally Financial reached a 52 Week high at 33.67
Ally Financial’s ALLY ratings have been upgraded by Moody’s Investors Service. The outlook for the company remains stable.
"Not the most exciting stock , but they have really strong financials. I’ve used there online banking and it’s very user friendly. I think more investors will flock to this stock for safety and a growing dividend ."
Downturn is caused by external factor that is slowing going away. There's nothing internally wrong with online banking and it will sure recover higher than before covid-19.
ALLY hits new 52 week high today!!!
"Ally had a presentation with analysts this am. Pretty bullish, loan deferments are better than expected. Business is good even with the pandemic. The digital economy is robust and Ally is there to capture some of that business. All aspects of the business are improving. Dividend is secure."
Great news on suspending buybacks to preserve the dividend. Just gotta wait it out
Whats with Ally?
"I invested, because I love their banking services and thought the stock was fairly valued. I believe online banking will continue to grow. I have to say I was disappointed with Ally Invest. it was slow and clunky for me. I also couldn’t place a trade order until It was fully funded unlike with my Vangaurd Account. They should improve the user experience for Ally invest as I am going to close my account as soon as I get to a year long capital gain threshold."
"Good follow through from Friday's earnings announcement. Volume in 1st hour is 50% of daily volume, and share price up 4%. Saw price targets raised to 34 and 38 today, FWIW."
Report looks good
Bought some yesterday at $24.25. Looks like a bargain to me.
"Don't use ALLY for equity investments. Yesterday, received a margin call. Today I got paid and figured I would have one day to meet the margin call....but nope. Ally liquidated a position to meet margin call before the market opened. First investment company that has ever closed out a position in less than 24 hours. DO NOT INVEST WITH ALLY. Used TD Ameritrade, ETRADE, or any other brokerage house."
Going to break $30 by Thanksgiving ... just about 90 days from now.
Ally Financial is up 4.94% to 50.35
"Next report card is out am on 10/21. CC at 0900. I will be listening. I haven't seen any estimates. Say we get another $2 plus eps and an augmented share buy back announcement, that should give the share price a boost. Continued slow rise in the 10 yr Treasury. All bullish."
Already up 130% on this stock. How much higher can it go? What are people's price targets?
Oh nice ALLY just got upgraded to “buy”. Let’s goooo
Earnings rising around 70% PE around 7. Ratio of % earnings rise over PE 10. This stock is a screaming buy.
"Bought 500 shares today, looking for some bounce here"
106 percent return on my investment. What a stock! Meanwhile the big banks like Goldman have only returned 30 percent. ALLY was one of only a few banks not to go down the toilet this year. A 100 percent return on a bank is a Tesla like return for the industry. More returns ahead you say? I do believe I will partake.
Will start accumulating sub 15. Moving slow and trading the volatility has worked well for me recently
$50 by end of April!!!
"Black Labia has some good points. If the economy starts to go south I will quickly sell Ally. Will probably take some profit soon by selling part of my holdings, just to protect myself."
I do love this stock but it is soooooo boring.
A $ 100 stock . Great financials great fundamentals.
Ally will have positive earnings! Slow grow long term $55 by July
"In the August issue of Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, Ally Bank is rated the #1 Internet Bank. I use Ally for checking, savings and CD accounts and agree with Kiplinger. I don't use Ally for stock trades, so I don't know anything about that part of their business."
congrats longs...wish I got in sooner than 26...my target is 35.00
I’ll be buying if jt falls below the 29.34 I sold it at on 12/21
"Find me a stock where 12%+ of the outstanding stocks are shorted and will do well. Even ALLY’s CFO said during Q1’20 earnings call their auto loans are going delinquent right and left. That is a tiny bank with a $6B market cap. Even huge banks like JPM, Citi or BAC struggle, this will blow up like in 2008. It was called GMAC that time. Read the history. Probably that would being some perspective and realistic thinking! The closer we get to Q2’20 fun will increase. Enjoy the ride to the bottom."
Undervalued company. I used them to trade. Very good service. Been trading commission-free since the pandemic started.
"Just listen to the last earnings conference call on 7/20. During the Q&A about half the analysts congratulated management on this last qtr's financial results. With the share buyback announcement, an increase to $2 billion over 2021, over the 2nd half of 2021 they will be buying back approx 6.9% of the outstanding shares. And they were talking about their CET1 ratio of 11.3% and they want to get it down over time to 9%, so they currently are carrying excess capital. Why hasn't the share price climbed after such great earnings? Market cap of $18.6 billion, a small fish in the big ocean of mega cap financial services firms. It is followed but not closely. And many investors perceive Ally to be simply an auto lender. Now maybe an auto lender with a decent size bank. I'm long the common. Maybe for more exposure at this current value LEAPS maybe a way to go. GL"
"Thanks for the cheap shares, I do not know what other people saw, but that was a incredible earnings report."
Got a call at 42 
Agree with cfra buy below 12. I use ally but their attractiveness for easy online banking and decent yield payouts to deposit holders does not outweigh how much they still depend on car loans. The real economy will catch ups with this sp. want own more but not until it’s a real value again and that’s below 12.
Another report card coming up for Ally. Presentation at 0840 on 5/19 for analysts/investors. You know who will be listening in.
New 52 week high for Ally today.
Yea have a call for the 19Thinking of cutting my loss
What are investors not liking about the Er? Everything looks good. Delinquencies are a bit up but not much. Am I missing something?
Ally is going up look at the graphs they were at 32 before acquiring easy money here just a minor dip get in while you can!!!
Buying on the dip. This is an easy decision.
"One of my favorite stocks, up and to the right and still so undervalued with a pe under 10. This one's a winner."
buying opportunity
ally invest. down on hot trading day!!!
Anybody buying this sell off? Coronavirus effecting a bank as much as rest of market seems a bit over done!
Bad Start to May Is a Sign of Things to Come for Markets. Ally is going down!https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles
Ally is great but their websight needs work. Too many glitches. I just got locked out of my account and they told me I'd get a call in 2 to 3 business days. there is no excuse for that.
Wow.......huge div increase and buy back announcement!! I thought we would have to wait till 7/20 to hear news. Guess the last qtr and near future was/is outstanding.
"Not good for ALLY - watch what warren Buffet says. Liquidity, liquidity and liquidity and conservatism none of which ALLY has to wrestle with mounting losses. Free fall on Monday again.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-anything-can-happen-in-markets-225337611.html"
Big endorsement on CNBC for Ally.. “a best pick in the financial sector for value and growth”..
Ally Financial reached a 52 Week high at 34.40
Time to buy and check back a year later.
2.11/1.93bn revenue. Wow. Just wow. Ally surprises up again.
Time to start the money train. 15 B market cap imminent
Listen to the Conference call. You will learn about the business and feel better about your holdings. And the beat goes on.
Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY): Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.33 beats by $0.83; GAAP EPS of $2.41 beats by $0.82.Revenue of $2.15B (+40.5% Y/Y) beats by $270M.
Next report card is 7/20. Stock is off highs. Lets see what management says about dividend and share buyback. Could provide a boost. Business trends still favorable. I will be listening.
"ALLY’s innovation outlook is neutral based on a current score of 23 out of 99, underperforming sector average. Jobs growth over the past year has decreased and insiders sentiment is neutral. ALLY is an Average Performer in terms of sustainability. Over the past 4 quarters ALLY beat earnings estimates 4 times and it pays dividend lower than its peers. So its one to watch but I am also watching this one. https://profiledstockpicks.com/zxper"
Ally is going to have great earnings! Beat the last 7 quarters. $55 end of June
32% increment in dividend . Great ! Numbers will be great for sure. I expect a new rally in the next couple of weeks.
Avoid the stock trading department if you have a broker assist trade phones will not be answered beyond 50 min
Just got in at 13.99 
What is the potential for this company over the next year or so? Buy or sell?
Mortgage and auto loan deferrals for months for existing customers. I have no problem going down with the ship when they show they care
ALLY is all about sub-prime auto loans blowing up! Plus they bought $4B hell sub-prime credit card business four months ago or so. Plus they gave a loan to Carvana for $2B so they can sell cars as if ALLY has enough capital (Please read regulators reports about ALLY not being capitalized sufficiently based on CCAR test). Wait one year to see how ALLY’s stock price approaching to zero.
"any idea why this and regional banks are down much more than C, BAC, JPM, etc...? Govt supplying loans to small businesses that have existing relationships with banks.. I would think this would only help Ally.. anybody? Not sure if there's great concern if you're long b/c Ally has one of the best balance sheets, while we collect on the healthy div-- I guess just stop looking at the drops b/c everybody is dropping until we go back to work or they find a vaccine? It traded between 11-18 when the news hit, so maybe it pops soon.. GLTALongs!"
"2nd attempt to post. Ally had a Investor presentation on 9/13. CFO spoke. Making 7% on the auto originations, cost of money below .4%. Auto biz is still robust. The new biz lines are increasing revenues. Ally continues to buy back shares and is not relying on rates to meet/exceed expectations. CFO declared that Ally is a Growth company. NIM performance is good at 3.57% last qtr. Their ROTCE is at 15%, analysts still for some reason feel this is not sustainable. CFO says it is. Time will tell. News is on the capital remarks. Ally's CET1 target is 9%, actual today is 11.3%, the firm is over capitalized by $3 billion. CFO said the current share buy back may be augmented. And I feel we will see another sizable dividend increase next year. And the beat goes on."
"Just listened to the Conference call on the earnings. Adj eps of $2.09 was impressive. All segments of the biz doing well. Congrats from many of the analysts on the call. Share buyback continues, no word on div increase. Share price surged to above $49 on the open. Analysts continue to question the sustainability of the performance after 2021, some doubt in their minds. If we can reach near $7 in eps for 2021, this is not a $48 stock, points to near $60."
Will be back above $30 with time. Fundamentals are there.
"Futures for Monday 5/4 is down big time. Especially, for riskier stocks and and asset classes. Expect another 8-9% drop in ALLY?s price tomorrow on 5/4, if not more. Sell off starts. Free fall for ALLY due to sub-prime AUTO LOANS. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-03/pound-dips-with-euro-as-trading-week-gets-underway-markets-wrap?srnd=premium"
"The lower this goes, the more shares they can buy back."
Ally hits new 52 week high on a down market day!!!
"Do not like the stock action today, maybe some news coming, out for now good luck guys"
I wonder how many stop loses this plowed through? All because of initial stampede. Looking for people to come to there senses and send this back above $30 quickly!
Anyone with ALLY brokerage accounts should be checking their balances.
"Ride the wave up to $60 by end Of Q3. Unexpected lease returns residuals up minimum $2000 per car due to shortage of used cars-just pads the bottom line, rare phenomenon in the lease side of the business."
Shorts have to cover. SPY futures up 3% AH. Run to cover.
Fix your trading platform. I have lost ten of thousands today and its only 12:30.
I think ally is going to be investigated for fraud. They are down today as well. They are keeping it down on purpose.

"Wow that EPS is better than the last few quarters from before the pandemic even started! 0.97, 0.95, and 0.80 before the pandemic. 1.25 EPS today. This thing is golden. Brick and mortar banks are done."
Why is this not trading around at least 10 times? Picked up some shares yesterday as it just looked too cheap but I'm not really sure why it is so undervalued
"A double for me since April when I started buying in. Earnings call on 1/22, should be good results and hopefully some mention of a share buyback or possible dividend increase. We may get both. Share price continues its slow climb towards $40."
"And our friend Bill Nygren w the Oakmark Fund continues to be bullish on Ally. Says management sees $5-6 eps in 2-3 years. Put a 9 multiple on that, share price $45-54. And we continue to grow. Lets see if we get a dividend raise in 3 months."
"As an ally customer, they have been cutting my savings account interest rate from i believe ~2% a year ago now to 1% eff tomorrow. Idk what that means for the company"
Another Earnings beat.. it’s like clock work
This seems undervalued since they are reporting nearly $1B profit quarterly......I think ALLY goes above $60.
$45.64 per share at close and the beat goes on. Saw an upgrade today. Rising rates and virus recovery is great for Ally. Digital banking. By June dividend increase? Maybe.
"Wow... a $1.6 billion share repurchase program equals 11.2% of the market cap. That is going to really support the share price, hence the gap up this morning. I wanted a dividend increase also but I'm happy. What a winner!!"
upgraded to overweight- Morgan Stanley
"A lot was learned from mistakes made the mortgage crisis. Much tougher standards now. Despite that, Moody upgrades their rating of Ally’s financials. Great news!"
Buy buy buy!
I see it over $100 ! Too cheap
Is it just me or have they been advertising a lot lately
Don't miss this boat under 20. It won't stay docked for long. Most other boats have sailed already.
"Honestly the question is..........what will the share price be Dec 2021?? With a recovering domestic economy by Spring 2021, a lot of pent up spending power. I just bought a pair of pants last week. First clothes purchase in 7 months. Ally could be near 38-39 by next Dec with a div of .21/qtr. Long since April, avg cost $17.50"
Took the opportunity to double down yesterday. I'm not a fan of the subprime market but ALLY still has solid fundamentals. I'm looking forward to the CEO justifying the purchase...5% of market cap traded hands yesterday. A statement is needed ASAP.
Can't get into my invest account.. so convenient
"Not invested yet, but I must say every week I hear people singing this banks praises for services. On my watchlist for now."
any reason why ALLY is falling while other banks are moving up? ..is there some negative news? I didn't find any news that's significantly negative to justify today's downward move.
"Ally Invest trading platform still filled with glitches, many customers' accounts STILL not displaying correctly."
I’m back again with another Johnny predicts $65 end of the year $60 by end of September
