"Next report card is out am on 10/21. CC at 0900. I will be listening. I haven't seen any estimates. Say we get another $2 plus eps and an augmented share buy back announcement, that should give the share price a boost. Continued slow rise in the 10 yr Treasury. All bullish."
"2nd attempt to post. Ally had a Investor presentation on 9/13. CFO spoke. Making 7% on the auto originations, cost of money below .4%. Auto biz is still robust. The new biz lines are increasing revenues. Ally continues to buy back shares and is not relying on rates to meet/exceed expectations. CFO declared that Ally is a Growth company. NIM performance is good at 3.57% last qtr. Their ROTCE is at 15%, analysts still for some reason feel this is not sustainable. CFO says it is. Time will tell. News is on the capital remarks. Ally's CET1 target is 9%, actual today is 11.3%, the firm is over capitalized by $3 billion. CFO said the current share buy back may be augmented. And I feel we will see another sizable dividend increase next year. And the beat goes on."
"Price target increases after earnings include:Janey goes to $81Barclays to $68BMO to $65Credit Suisse to $65But one goes down:Piper to $59Does anyone on the board know why Piper went down, their rationale, having read their note/report?"
Way oversold! Started a few positions under $48.
"the President of Ally sold 4,125 shares on Sept 1, that's 1.9% of their total shares. the market is reacting to that news"
"Australia reported higher than expected inflation this quarter. In high inflation environments expectation is that consumer financial stocks perform worse than others. All consumer financial stocks are down. However, I dont think it’s gonna have any impact on car buyers. More EV buyers, mire financing needed, better for us! Stay long"
beats on earnings by 10% and then drops 4.5%...oh well.
"They have excess capital on their books and investors wanted them to either increase the share buy back or increase the dividend. They have decided to invest in the biz and buy the credit card firm. I am a little disappointed but they see growth opportunities they want to invest in. And analysts see the froth in the auto sector declining soon (which I don't think is going to happen). Over $3 billion in excess capital, could have bought back 14% of the firm or paid out a special dividend of $8.3 per share. Granted one would not do all of that.........just showing you how much extra cash they are holding."
"Ally going the way of Blockbuster, see yah all at $42.50 next week"
"“underserved”Get woke, go broke.￼"
Wow what a huge day! Huge rally. Not.
selling off again. Wow
"It's an old adage, but a good one in stocks...""Never try to catch a falling knife"""
I sold out today with a 190 percent gain
I'm in.
Thursday 27th = 5% a.m. drop
Guess nobody want's their dividend? Ex date is tomorrow. Figured it would be up. Ah well I am getting mine. Cheers.
Looks like ally is buying its own shares
I see it over $100 ! Too cheap
I guess investors were not thrilled with the move into offering credit cards. Curious.
why ally is down?
"quite the pull back, in the 5s p/e now"
"Ally's auto biz could soon be going out of business while they continue to use regular US Mail to send and lose Car Titles that are paid off. While eBay sellers can't do business on their platform without sending tracking info, even on low priced items, Ally does not track such important documents like Car Titles sent by regular mail. While they save a couple bucks on these shipments without tracking, they put their company at risk when USPS takes too long or loses the car title in the mail. Ally believes car titles are less important that something cheap on eBay. Sell, Sell, Sell while this wing of Ally sinks."
GM's 2021 Q3 earnings was nice. I don't know if I'd wait until I see this rebounds but I bought some today.
sell on the news?
Ally Financial to present at the 2nd Annual Bernstein Operational Decisions Virtual Conference.So they can explain why there website crashes every other day and there stock is tanking
No confidence but I added today.
What’s going on? It’s been doing really well this year
PER only 5.8
"One concern I have had, others perhaps too, on ALLY buying a credit card company, is that they are getting into a business that could be ""disrupted"" by new fintechs such as those offering ""Buy Now Pay Later"". They claim that in coming years, artificial intelligence data will guide BNPL companies to make better credit decisions than traditional credit card companies can make using traditional tools such as FICO scores. With better decisions, they will have lower losses, and can offer lower interest rates and fees, thus outcompeting old style credit card issuers, taking increasing market share. Early data now shows BNPL companies, AFRM and others, are starting to see increasing defaults, delinquent payments, and credit losses. Their rapid growth in loan balances comes from lower credit standards, which may prove to bite them!"
Ally might be a good company but their mobile trading app is BY FAR the worst. It is painful to use. Will be transferring my account as soon as I can. ETFC far superior.
Wow this is getting pounded
"After the recent price drop I think we could use some optimism that this decline is only brief, with bigger gains in the near future. I came across this article about Visa investing in a company which produces digital credit cards, and ALLY is among its customers. As an online bank, ALLY's expenditure acquiring the credit card company Fair Square Financial seems to make a lot more sense. Not sure if it will impact the stock short term...but I'd like to hope so.https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/10/27/visa-invests-in-bay-area-fintech-deserve.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
"Be curious to see the share price in 5-6 days, like to see $55 by then"
This seems undervalued since they are reporting nearly $1B profit quarterly......I think ALLY goes above $60.
Phenomenal buying opportunity with this dip here! Load on LEAPS and see you all in a few years. This stock is ridiculously undervalued!
Added at $50.80
Do you guys follow http://the-alphatrader.com/? It seems way better than all the spam on the ALLY board - The alerts have been great!
"Revenue and EPS have been growing. My sense as a customer is that this bank is well put together. They have one of the websites I've seen in terms of UI and functionality, and they offer a compelling mix of investment products. I see continued growth ahead."
I do love this stock but it is soooooo boring.
