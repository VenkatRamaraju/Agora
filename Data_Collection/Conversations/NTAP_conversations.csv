I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Also target price is $80 with all time high 83.60. NTAP has held up well in the past few weeks vs other techs.
made a new high today
in 3 months you will see the div raise from .4 to .6this is now a dividend stock and they have room to grow the div at nice rates for a long time
George Kurian is a phenomenal CEO and NetApp is the best place to work!
what is going on here? earnings looked good.
i a. l looking at 70 by mid march
"market down ,NTAP up staying long.eps. is very good and cash flow is even better."
"Just been recommended by Tom Lee in Fundstrat's premium research service, expect to make some nice short term gains"
and ntap has 6 bil to repatriate
Looks like the PSTG huge miss might be weighing on NTAP this morning.
100.00 by eoy ?
NetApp started at overweight with $80 stock price target at J.P. Morgan
Read this short squeeze article on NTAP https://news.squeezereport.com/short-squeeze/netapp-inc-nasdaq-ntap-short-squeeze
NetApp is up 5.86% to 87.09
"I've noticed this stock tends to drop after reporting (great) earnings, and as analysts revise estimates (upwards), it recovers and sets the stage for the next gap up."
Next for a trade is SPLK or AMAT on Thursday with earnings after the close.
and another new high
I think a prudent trim @90 may be in order...

"Intelligent investors know this is a winner and great report. Tomorrow will be great, watch."
Lots of upgrades for NTAP this morning with one-year target $75.
"technical analysis: trend is intact, long term trend line is at 72.50 from the Feb low. and today's candle is growing a lower tail ..all bullish.ive been in and out of NTAP since a few months after the IPO and made good money selling puts under NTAP for years. i was mostly out of the 2001 drop. My puts were only exercised 4x in that time period and each time i added shares.Look at it this way, every piece of internet traffic is stored forever NTAP growth is built to last!"
"Amazon Web Services just announced FSx for ONTAP, this is a HUGE win for NetApp. NetApp software has been integrated into enterprise data management services by all of the major cloud providers."
"good company, the market just doesn't have the appetite for these valuations these days"
Crushed it!
I'm fine with that quarter.
100 is in the cards short term
pls pls pls +20% today
That was a close call. Thanks for selling your stocks at 53
"NTAP: breaking out today, may see 75$ by friday"
ntap can sell all types of options adding strong growth
Longs...if this is really down 10% its a screaming buy right? 5 billion in cash and a 16 billion mkt value? What am I missing.
"Weird board, stock tanks again as it did last ER release and longs are thrilled!"
the new highs will cont to happen
Why is NetApp stock down ~5% today?
price should be much higher going to make a move up this week
Great relative move today. This will add strength to the chart
Where are all the negative naysayers now??
yep green
$NTAP Upgraded by William Blair Market Perform » Outperform
imo the big deal is the buyback of stock im happy we ith the quarter i don't care how the mkt reacted
Nothing too exciting here. Revenue pretty much in line from what they said during last earnings. Next Q looking the same too.Hope it doesn’t drop like last Q
This used to be a great a stock but it is out of favor. I sold out a couple years ago for more than the stock is now after waiting for years for to to rerurn to it's former glory. I guess their product isn't as leading edge as it used to be. They need to turn themselves in a full blown cloud company or do something to increase rvenue.
kurian twins rock Google up 29 bucks today
Jeez! Dropped for a reason. This will close around 58-59. Report is awesome and dropped for a very minor reason?
the new division growing 140 percent last yr if it grows 90 percent this yr it will boost the whole growth profile for the country
hard to tell what ntap will do pre earnings but i do see 90 is in the cards
"yowza- just grabbed some shares from 40.25 down to 40...lordy below a 10P/E and nearly a 5% divy, works for me..."
Will see around $54 tomorrow
This will be Green tomorrow!
"so the upgrade was excellent call, glad."
"everyone relax. What matters is where we are headed and the call has been reassuring. PPS will recover. Do not sell out thinking that this company is overvalued at the moment. While NTAP will provide greater detail regarding capital allocation on ~$4B repatriated cash at analyst day in April, a 3% dividend was mentioned during an analyst question. This company knows how to take care of shareholders! GL everyone."
ntap performing like a good stock today's follow up is encouraging
this is so easy with the company buying back loads of stock once the economy gains its legs ntap can earn 6 buck a share or more its clearly 100 dollar plus stock and tou get paid a nice dividend to wait
bought at 69.22
"Just typical Wall St manipulation, also known as fraud. The big guys run the show, always have and apparently always will.The SEC always looks the other way. One stock has disappointing earnings and the stocks jumps 30%, another stock blows out earnings and the shares crater like the company is going out of business. Doesn't make any sense and that's how the big boys like. They don't want the little guys to be able to make sense of anything. And just to throw you a curve ball now and then, they'll drop the stock A/H like this and it will do a complete 180 the next day. It's all BS."
just picked me up a few shares...mo' if it goes low-er
this is sucn a great co 82 by june 30
"solid earnings, time to load up !"
the best part is ntap is doubling its dividend to 160
Rally anytime now!!

cramer says own coup since ntap has a division that does rhe same as coup ntap is the better buy
70 coming
every tech is booming whats wrong with company
28% drop in expected earnings for the quarter and a 17% decline in revenue. Any guesses on price targets for tomorrow and why?
192 percent growth in public cloud offerings
"wow NTAP is tappin' it today, on the way back to $50. Who didn't buy this for the 4.5%+ yield, yearly increasing, well covered div alone? Cap app and TR take care of themselves.."
ntap makes new highs e ery few days
looks like 90 by December
NTAP is a great BUY under $75 seriously. We will see it moves to above $80 within a week from now. Mark my words.
"wooooow, I just saw the price after hours and thought it must be a typo, up14%... I've been buying it in the 41's and 40's, and even 39's with the sweet div I had no problem waiting..Every IT dog has it's day, just need some patience..yowza..."

"NetApp is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings report Feb. 14 and its analyst day is set for April 5.The AnalystsLoop Capital Markets analyst Ananda Baruah upgraded NetApp from Hold to Buy with a $69 price target, suggesting 20-percent upside.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded the shares from Neutral to Buy and increased the price target from $63 to $74.Loop Capital: NetApp Has Business"
">2x in NTAP in < one year, not counting divs... not too shabby %^)."
"Hey boys. A while back I gave you some financial advise on stocks to buy. One was TSLA. You bad-mouthed it, did a few ha-has, etc. Want to bad-mouth my recommendation now? Up big-time in after market today. I won't bother telling you why, just get off your a... and research it. When come back and tell me my advice was wrong!! Oh, by the way, I haven't heard you talking up NTAP dividend increase lately. What happened to that? Could be you just didn't know what you were talking about. Now, go back to your sand box and play; I'll go to my box of $$$$ and play. You have a good day!"
"Great relative push today, with supporting volume. $45/$46 area is next test....."
Ex dividend day on its way with Juicy dividend and unaffected by corona. Right intrinsic value . Looking for long
80 here we come
72 hahaha try 82
what a nice day and stocks who rally so much in a day usually rally some more the following day
new high in the next few days
ntap will cont to buy back stock and part of the money repatriated will go to buy backs
ntap extremely undervalued
Only 200k shares traded after hours. Wait for the morning upgrades to push above $80
This stock is undervalued since it's not affected much by Corona Virus. Time to get in.
"This company has been categorized has a low growth value stock, but this last upside surprise ER changes that. It's now a fast growing cloud play, the likes of $SPLK, $DDOG, $TWLO, $FSLY etc. With a P/S of 1.8 and a P/E of 12 it's got a lot of catching up to do. From ER press release: ""NetApp public cloud services annualized recurring revenue of $178 million, an increase of 192% year-over-year"""
nvidia ntap match up looks good
ntap prob will raise div when they report
"do these guys have any real cloud offering? old storage going away fast , can they offset those lost revenues with cloud base optons?"

https://discord.gg/SjJ8qcv
Added to my position on today’s weakness. GL out there
"yowza, added a few more shares in the $41.x. NTAP should be going up today not down. With still a sweet >4.5% div, works for me..."
"Shareholders of NetApp are paid a 2.37% dividend. Goldman Sachs has set its price objective is $94. The posted consensus target price is $84.05, and the stock closed most recently at $67.65 per share. The upside to the Goldman Sachs target is a huge 47%.Pioneer Natural Resources"
i see ntap over 100 soon
"I'm gonna N-tap into a few more shares if it falls to 66.. that's a current div yield of 3%, with a div hike coming next Q, price right below FV. works for me.."
"I'm going to say that some one knows something about the earnings call that will be disappointing. Unfortunately they're not on the great wave that they've been successfully riding for the last 4/5 years, which consistently beat expectation. NetApp is still the biggest independent provider of data management/storage solutions in the World, which is nothing to be sneezed at. Every other vendor looks up to and/or has ripped off netapps design for their own over the years.The biggest challenge they face today is the struggle for relevance in a World that's away from physical/on prem infrastructure, which is why they now call themselves a hybrid/multi-cloud provider.The big DC's and hyperscalers are the threat and like anything the slow burn toward has almost deminshed as challenges with respect to trusting cloud have been addressed and easily overcome.I think there will always be a place for on premises storage for certain industries but the pool is getting smaller"
ntap is so far infront of everyone what others need 50000 to build a storage rm ntap can buikd a rm doing the same job or better in 1500 square feet they cant compete
as long as ntap is taking share and it is this is a buying opportunity
looking for 75 and a div boost
Listening to the call. Very bullish. Dividend increase to 3% and $4B buyback. Expecting growth mid single digits through 2021..
csco isnt going to offer 100 for ntap and thats what it takes
Missed the dip today could of picked up more share. I'm slacking in my old age.
ela what is it it is mentioned many times in the conference call but i have no idea what the letters mean also how big is the ca contract
earn of 4.50 a share with growth makes ntap way to cheap
Cisco beats by a penny! NTAP beats by $0.25 cents. Cisco up almost $3 after hours. NTAP should be much higher tomorrow!

"I have to say, what is HP doing? They are falling so far behind Dell at this point is seems inconceivable they aren’t looking at Netapp. They are missing their chance with this drop and there is literally nobody else out there that can fix their Enterprise problem. There entire portfolio is antiquated."
the kuruan twins rock george is ntap ceo thonas is president of Google cloud any pullback is a buying opportunity
the public cloud growth will cont to be outstanding
love the dividend
ntap way of hybrids taking advantage of the public cloud grew 140 percent last yr let's hope it continues to grow fast
Moving forward now! People will realize why sold it short. This will go back to where it was by tomorrow.
a stock to love
"It will come back tomorrow, absolutely superlative earning and revenue growth. Wall Street is rigged just to scare off some weak hands. Tomorrow it will be higher than today's closing price. Analyst Mean Target price is $75."
nice upgrade today raising stock price to 75 stating ntap s flash tech is supior
im expecting it to come back with a stromg market green day
"PSTG: delivered SLOWOUT EPS and REVENUE, it went down because of JP Morgan target 21$/shareThis gove clue to NTAP will deliver BLOWOUT number as well"
Higher and higher
Added shares and hoping for a good report!
"Another bad quarter for NTAP. I'm so glad that I dumped this stock in the mid 60's . It's revealing when it can't go anywhere in the best economy we've had in a while. It says one thing, that the company can't compete as well as it used to be able too. Anyway, good luck to whoever held, you're gonna need it."
why did the revenue drop this year? Im looking for a entry but does anyone know why rev dropped?Thanks
"I'm buying more today, with >4.5% div yield.. works for me!"
"VP Anderson just bought $500,000 worth of NTAP at $61.78.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000161409421000021/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml"
"Aren't we suppose to hear about a dividend increase today?Tech Trader Daily: NetApp Drops 11%: CFO Says Wait Till Analyst Day for Dividend Details -- Barron's Blog6:07 pm ET February 14, 2018 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Tiernan RayShares of storage technology pioneer NetApp ( NTAP) are down $6.39, or 11%, at $54.25, in late trading, even though the company this afternoon reported results that beat fiscal Q3 expectations, and forecast revenue higher this quarter as well.Conversations on the conference call tonight implysome might be a little bit impatient about capital returns, perhaps amplified by Cisco Systems ( CSCO) announcing a big boost to its buybacks tonight, and chip equipment vendor Applied Materials ( AMAT) doing the same.One analyst asked if the company could talk about what it's doing with the $4 billion it is repatriating from overseas, following U.S. tax reform.CFO Ronald Pasek said to wait to hear more on the company's analyst day in April, reiterating the company wants to ""increases the dividend significantly.""CEO George Kurian called the quarter's results ""strong,"" citing ""accelerating revenue and strong cash generation."" Cash flow after property plant and equipment more than doubled, year over year.Added Kurian, ""We saw a solid demand environment and customer momentum, landing wins and footprint expansions with leading organizations in all geographies.""""With our Data Fabric Strategy and industry-leading solutions, we are winning new customers and expanding our business opportunity.""The company noted that sales of its newer "" all-flash-array"" products , which were a big focus of analysts going into the report, rose by 50%, year over year, on an ""annualized"" basis that is now trending toward $2 billion.Revenue in the three months ended in January rose 8%, year over year, to $1.52 billion, yielding EPS of 99 cents, excluding some costs.Analysts had been modeling $1.5 billion and 91 cents."
and yet another new high
2to3times a week ntap makes a new high
"good earnings, beating estimates expectations, and it drops mean buying opportunity."
L@@KS green to me 82.72 +0.25 (0.30%)After hours: 4:43PM EDT
i like the giant div raise
I like mazor I am building a position I own alot of ntap but I have owned it for yrs
5.00 to 5.25 seems pretty likely sales growth will be the challenge i trust kurian and his abilities to increase sales Esp with best products in the industry As well as a complete value on price I have faith in this stellar company
"Reality check.Both $CSCO and $NTAP are blatantly lying about macro economics for their poor show. Fact of the matter is that their legacy business model prospects are shrinking and these companies didn't innovate fast enough to get on to new revenue streams or adapt their business models in time. They emotionally got attached to their existing products and the old guard didn't give the younger talent a chance to innovate.Management shakeup is what is needed. These companies should respect the marketcaps they have and buyout promising companies to spur their topline revenue growth. Otherwise, these companies will go into oblivion in next 10 years.Enterprises are innovating, but these companies are not."
NTAP is fading.....tug of war at $45 price level....let's see how it closes today....
These guys are the only company positioned to take advantage of the storage market and cloud convergence. Everyone else is still in slideware mode and futures. I’ll hold long.
Let’s see a nice pop after hours and it hold tomorrow.
Wow not an active board and taps taking a dive after they beat earnings and estimates any comments
"disappontment is bad but this is still a profitable company, trading now at about 12x earnings. expect some buybacks and a nice dividend boost."
Earnings Beat!
$goog $googl $ntap partnership for google cloud is huge for this company... great time to get in
NTAP is awesome and the recent partnership with NVIDIA for AI is smart.
1.60 a yr divided is a big deal
ntap bought back 6 mil shares in the last quarter any drop and ntap will be buying
Whats pushing the drop? I haven't seen anything.
buybacks dividend and internal growth taking mkt share from everyone looks good to me
i like the 8 cent a quarter div raise although the company didnt state it was permanent
Big day for me. 1000 NTAP and 1000 CSCO at 3:59PM. Happy happy happy. Drinking a Heineken right now. About time I went two for two.LOL LONGS HAPPY FOR US ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
ntap technology is far superior to anyone
"Will rally, expect to see green today. Great time to buy after that awesome report."
there is a 80 percent chance ntap raises the dividend but slows its buyback program
Dont worry about AH. This will do NICELY tomorrow....
$NTAP Morgan Stanley slightly lifts target to $92www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/morgan-stanley-lifted-the-target-to-on-netapp-inc-ntapnsd-92/

"Be interesting how the market reacts to the earning report, exceeded revised numbers...based on 800 points down yesterday...I think the earnings are not good enough...Good luck"
"So the bottom line here rests on two things. EMC has been muted by Dells lack of investment into R&D as expected. All the major players at EMC have bailed as expected. No mystery. Netapp is the Lone Ranger in storage and doing pretty well capturing the market and if the get out of their own way they will far exceed EMC before the sell out to Dell. Netapp needs to continue working with the cloud but most importantly learn how to partner even with Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc."

I’ve traded this on and off for over 20 years. It’s more investing than trading actually. This company is like Old Faithful. It’s one of my very favourites. Why? Because it’s a cash generator and a market leader.
i am more confident in ntap im thinking april has been pretty good
moving
Come on. Take out and hold $45....positive technical stance if we close above $45
Volume greater than 3M daily average already. Let’s hope for some good results this afternoon !!!

Go check $NTAP! Great growth approaching soon!
POS stock. Don't plan on seeing 80's anymore. Think 30's.
I am hoping for a dividend increase when earning are announced
"I'm surprised why the financial press is reporting the results as ""mixed"". The company beat both analyst consensus earnings and revenue estimates. And raised guidance for the rest of year for both revenue and EPS range. I'd have expected the stock to go up 6-to-7% in the after market (look at lumbering Cisco). What gives? Opinions?"
another new high

ntap has 21 dollars of its stock price in cash
"Is it true (as Yahoo statistics have it) that NTAP has $3.9B in cash and $1.8B in debt? If that is true , someone should just buy the company for it's cash, payoff the debt and absorb the customer base for free (plus $2B)."
Bought some 41.5 & 42 Calls this morning. This aftermarket and EPS is blessing me!
