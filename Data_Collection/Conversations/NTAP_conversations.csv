"do these guys have any real cloud offering? old storage going away fast , can they offset those lost revenues with cloud base optons?"
Volume greater than 3M daily average already. Let’s hope for some good results this afternoon !!!
Come on!
"Amazon Web Services just announced FSx for ONTAP, this is a HUGE win for NetApp. NetApp software has been integrated into enterprise data management services by all of the major cloud providers."
Whats your Price Target? Also trading holding or a bit of both?
Bought some 41.5 & 42 Calls this morning. This aftermarket and EPS is blessing me!
"Intelligent investors know this is a winner and great report. Tomorrow will be great, watch."
I don’t want to be negative but I have inside info. Please watch out. This is going to drop
"everyone relax. What matters is where we are headed and the call has been reassuring. PPS will recover. Do not sell out thinking that this company is overvalued at the moment. While NTAP will provide greater detail regarding capital allocation on ~$4B repatriated cash at analyst day in April, a 3% dividend was mentioned during an analyst question. This company knows how to take care of shareholders! GL everyone."
Earnings Beat!
NTAP is a great BUY under $75 seriously. We will see it moves to above $80 within a week from now. Mark my words.
why the big drop today
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
GS did it again! Days ago GS downgraded a bunch of steel companies.
"Shareholders of NetApp are paid a 2.37% dividend. Goldman Sachs has set its price objective is $94. The posted consensus target price is $84.05, and the stock closed most recently at $67.65 per share. The upside to the Goldman Sachs target is a huge 47%.Pioneer Natural Resources"
"good company, the market just doesn't have the appetite for these valuations these days"
"yowza, up almost 50% in 7 months since buy, still rocking a >3.5% div yield, 2x the yield of the S&P500..Increasing every year, 5yr. avg. annual DGR=28%, PR still <50%. ...works for me!. Buy em' low, under FV when theyre getting no love and all the rumors are bad. That's what I did with AVGO, AMAT and earlier QCOM. Latest is CSCO. All great cos. return to FV...%^ )"
new high
"I'm surprised why the financial press is reporting the results as ""mixed"". The company beat both analyst consensus earnings and revenue estimates. And raised guidance for the rest of year for both revenue and EPS range. I'd have expected the stock to go up 6-to-7% in the after market (look at lumbering Cisco). What gives? Opinions?"
NetApp is up 5.86% to 87.09

"I'll say it once again. Don't get to worked up about the after hours movement. Intelligent investors will buy this up tomorrow, everything looked great, it will be a good day. Green."

Listening to the call. Very bullish. Dividend increase to 3% and $4B buyback. Expecting growth mid single digits through 2021..
I’ve traded this on and off for over 20 years. It’s more investing than trading actually. This company is like Old Faithful. It’s one of my very favourites. Why? Because it’s a cash generator and a market leader.
These guys are the only company positioned to take advantage of the storage market and cloud convergence. Everyone else is still in slideware mode and futures. I’ll hold long.
what is going on here? earnings looked good.
"I'm buying more today, with >4.5% div yield.. works for me!"
Will see around $54 tomorrow
ela what is it it is mentioned many times in the conference call but i have no idea what the letters mean also how big is the ca contract
"Yowza... now back >100% gain total, 120% up from first buy 5-2020. Div has been payed and hiked 220% since divs began in 2014...superb yield and DGR for a tech co.. Back to double digit % growth after 2020 Covid year. P/E is well below market avg. Current price is < 15P/E on FY23 E est. It's a keeper..."
Higher and higher
This used to be a great a stock but it is out of favor. I sold out a couple years ago for more than the stock is now after waiting for years for to to rerurn to it's former glory. I guess their product isn't as leading edge as it used to be. They need to turn themselves in a full blown cloud company or do something to increase rvenue.
I think a prudent trim @90 may be in order...
"disappontment is bad but this is still a profitable company, trading now at about 12x earnings. expect some buybacks and a nice dividend boost."
Wow not an active board and taps taking a dive after they beat earnings and estimates any comments
"It will come back tomorrow, absolutely superlative earning and revenue growth. Wall Street is rigged just to scare off some weak hands. Tomorrow it will be higher than today's closing price. Analyst Mean Target price is $75."
I am hoping for a dividend increase when earning are announced
