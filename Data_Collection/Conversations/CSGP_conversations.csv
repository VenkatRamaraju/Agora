On sale at these levels. First bought this name in 2015 and even at these levels have a 3 bagger. This name goes back to 900 long term.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
"Q1...another great Q from CSGP: double digit growth across all significant metrics,above concensus EPS/Rev, increased forward guidance across board. Per Proxy they are considering a 10:1 spilt. AM in June SHs will vote to increase share count to accommodate potential split. Technically stock needs some selling soon, but not much to dislike in this report. What a fantastic Company/investment."
"The split seems like a good opportunity for a small investor such as myself. I plan to hold, hoping it will compound -- to infinity!"
Holy schmoley! CSGP just walked away from CLGX.
$1050 price target by April!
"Rent Path CEO clearly not a fan of AF/CSGP :It's a total grand slam for RentPath and our employees; in the space of a few days, we have reached an agreement to be acquired by Redfin for a higher price,"" said Dhiren Fonseca, RentPath's CEO. ""In Redfin we now have a partner who we know we can trust, who shares our values and moral ethic, and whose commitment to delivering value to customers is aligned with our DNA. RentPath has always represented the best partner for multifamily communities and an employer of choice in our industry. $52,000,000 is a lot of money, and CoStar shareholders and customers should be asking themselves, who ultimately will be stuck with that bill. We are now free to focus on what matters most – serving our customers and beating our competition."""
"company seems to be doing a lot of advertising of TEN X , well as LOOP."
"So I bought in, long in 2014 after hearing the president speak at a conference. He is smart and connected. I'm 22% per year annualized return.. Couldn't be happier. I'm holding on. Join the good times. The commercial and residential realtors all use their information."
"I wouldn't be surprised, if CoStar $CSGP would buy $MTTRCoStar buys every company, which enhances its Real Estate infradtructure. Mark my words. "
Parking extra long cash here for a ride.
"This remarkable Company continues to innovate. Today they announced Citysnap partnering with the NYC agents association to offer a product directly competing with Zillow's Street Easy. Citysnap will offer better protection for agents & is touting a better search & customer experience by providing direct line to listing agent. Very interesting strategy by AF/CSGP with their continued focus upon & protection of the agency relationship. If Citysnap NYC gains traction it will not only pull from Zillow's SE, but also scale out to large cities nationwide. I'm seeing why Dan Loeb & 3rd Point joined us as SHs recently. CSGP's growth could be on verge of accelerating even @ this size"
"Case for shorting anyone? This company relies on data from commercial real estate folks, they used to be able to get it because their platform was reasonably priced and they had broad market following. Not anymore, the pricing has gone up by 1000% for listing with them and everything they have relies on professional brokers who they have #$%$ off. Guess is it will tumble when cut in revenue stream is realized"
"Future trend? Zillow's I-buying effort with CSGP (via Homesnap)moving toward a data repository (ie national MLS type system)moving toward co-existence? CSGP not disrupting broker structure, but enhancing data/analytics. Very good article by TMF. Future of the RE market will certainly be fascinating to watch develop. Anyone able to comment on speculation that CSGP may be strongly bidding for CLGX in early '21?Would seem like a big financial gulp as they integrate other recent deals & simultaneously launch their residential effort? How would CLGX's offerings assist CSGP residential,if at all? or does CSGP pass on CLGX?"
CoStar reached an all time high at 100.84
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Announce a $1.25B equity FO that ,depending upon pricing, should add 5% to existing O/S & the stock trades up. Impressive. Certainly an institutional SH vote of confidence in company's ROI capabilities wrt the cash raised. With $1.1 B net(of recent acquisition) cash currently on BS & another $1B+ soon to be added it will be fascinating to see what their intentions are in this distressed CRE environment."
Re CLGX : CSGP appears very much in the running for CLGX despite CLGX's BOD accepting the lower PE bid as both activist CLGX SHs have now stepped aside & sold out. Interesting to see if CSGP walks or appeals to CLGX SHs directly. $80(PE) VS $86(CSGP) with CLGX mgt/BOD floating (unrealistic) anti-trust concerns with the higher CSGP offer? hmmm looking like CLGX mgt more concerned with maintaining job security with distant PE owners vs putting SH interests first by accepting higher offer. This could get interesting IF CSGP wants to fight for CLGX or not.
"Q3 coming next week. No bolt-on acquisition, yet, but CSGP's cashed up & likely waiting for price declines. AF's driving point on last CC was that CSGP had developed into a counter cyclical company. We'll find out this Q if he was right. A lot of angst & disruption in CRE & RE markets in general during pandemic. Longer term ,companies are rethinking office based workforce needs. Do these metrics push demand toward CSGP's digital solutions? Will there be segment strength to offset potentially declining subscriptions in cost conscious, virus impacted RE market? This company is known for superb execution & has delivered so far in an extremely challenging year. I have an inkling that current macro RE challenges/disruption may actually benefit CSGP going forward as their offerings gain 'mission critical' recognition. Technically, need to recall $728 gap... will it act as a magnet & fill in coming weeks/months or will CSGP finally just gap & go above $1,000 ?"
