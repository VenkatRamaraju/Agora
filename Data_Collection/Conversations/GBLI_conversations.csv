"Another day, another beatdown for the GBLI shareholder. Sure glad the management and board are guiding the ship in the right direction."

GBLIZ is being called in on 8/15. Time to buy GBLIL which cannot be called in until 4/22. Super safe 8% return at these levels for a couple years.
Only things puzzling here is why no insiders have been buying with such a cheap valuation.

"So CEO ""retirement"" is following a board director resigning. Rats jumping ship here?"
"Raymond Harbert, an investment company in Alabama, has bought approximately 553,000 shares this quarter. That's probably the only thing keeping this company's shares afloat. It's certainly not because of the redomestication scheme."

Stock in freefall. Again. Must be another terrible earnings report coming up.
The entire Russell 2000 index ETF was up 2.63% today. GBLI eating its dust. Sad sad times for GBLI shareholders.

Worst performing property/casualty stock of the day. Great job!

The grand plan is working well. Destroying shareholder wealth every day. Great job GBLI board and management.
On the other hand it seems the insiders get generous quarterly stock awards so I guess why put up your own cash when you get the shares for free?
GBLI is up 4.92% to 38.59
Why is the company even listed on an exchange? It's traded a whopping 1400 shares today as of 3pm ET. They claimed that being a domestic company would attract investors from around the world. Well we can surely see that was a load of #$%$

"Great News>>>In connection with the redomestication, Global Indemnity eliminated approximately $1 billion of inter-company indebtedness, eliminated $174 million (57%) of external indebtedness (reducing the Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio from 29% to 15%), and provided parent Company with approximately $250 million of cash and investments that may be utilized by the Company for general corporate purposes.The redomestication was completed without any material transaction-related taxes to Global Indemnity. Further, the expected future expense savings and operating efficiencies are expected to largely offset the anticipated increase in prospective tax liabilities resulting from the transactions. Apart from incidental transaction related fees and expenses, completion of the redomestication had no impact on the Company’s book value or book value per share, which were $735 million and $51.24, respectively, at June 30, 2020.https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/28/2085195/0/en/Global-Indemnity-Completes-Redomestication-to-the-United-States.html"

In a raging bull market GBLI is languishing. The board and management should be held accountable. And the redomestication scheme was a total farce - the shares are 15% lower after approval.

I can see that the shareholder wealth destruction scheme is working to plan. They claimed that the shares selling at 50% of book value was not appropriate. They now sell for 40% of book. I can see that this grand plan is working quite well.

"This company is a disaster. $1.48 loss for 2020. Revenue down. They spent $21 million to redomesticate when they already mostly operate in the US. CEO ""retired"" and a board member quit. No update on new CEO. Did not provide quarterly numbers for the 4th quarter, just the annual totals. No information on K-1 for shareholders. Stock liquidity has dried up even though they said that becoming a US domiciled entity would increase the number of potential investors. Dual class shares with the public shareholder basically having no say in the company's affairs. Geesh, what a clust@@@@!!"

"So someone gave me a down vote on all my posts. If you think GBLI is such a great investment, then why don't you make your case? The entire Russell 2000 is up 28% in the last year and GBLI is down 3%. That's a pretty pathetic performance."

"Harbert Fund Advisors addressed a letter to Global Indemnity, requesting that its board “immediately return” $250 million in excess capital derived from Global Indemnity’s August 2020 redomestication. Harbert noted that due to that restructuring, Global Indemnity is now a limited liability corporation, triggering its removal from the Russell 2000, and pressuring Global Indemnity stock. Herbert concluded that the return of the excess capital would help to “address the long-term, significant underperformance” of the stock. Harbert owns 849,985 shares, or 8.1%, of the property and casualty insurer."

The entire market rallies 2% or more and this thing can't even get a bid. Seems like this company needs a new board and management team.
