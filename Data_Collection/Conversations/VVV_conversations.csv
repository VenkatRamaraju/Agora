VVV is down 4.91% to 20.33
VVV will hit 23 very soon
VVV is down 5.02% to 17.89
Valvoline is up 8.68% to 20.29
Weeks of daily new lows confirm that ASH and banks purposely overestimated VVV by 20% as a means to trap IPO shareholders. Fact: If the VVV price history chart were upside down all parties would be elated.Fact: ADP successfully spun off CDK with nearly exact price conditions and share amounts. Difference: ADP intended to build shareholder value rather than fleece shareholders.
Continued poor stock price management quickly lends itself to Foreign ownership or Hostile led asset sale off. ASH/VVV needs to immediately convert their attitude from bad greed to good greed by replacing the upcoming stock DUMP with stock HOLD by ASH until stock value is fair. Continued stiff necking will yield more 52 week lows and this ridiculous ~ $1.2 Billion of share undervalue. - Dumb is as dumb does. All those plans are toast if share price isn’t managed. They need to get some stock management help onboard FAST. Perhaps a 5 year old somewhere has a few minutes to help out.

Lying Obama / Hillary and democrats did mass coverup. Liberal lying press gave corrupt Obama a free pass. 4- Brave American died. Shame on Hillary and Obama. https://reclaimourrepublic.wordpress.com/2017/02/16/video-new-docs-mb-obama-hillary-knew-benghazi-attack-not-caused-by-protests/

Why did you not care about the shareholders who FUNDED you for ZERO profit since the IPO? You GIVE them ANY shares?
VVV is up 5.14% to $20.03
"Sheer sell volume is staggering today. 800 thousand in two hours. Clear evidence of the self-enriched stampede to the ATM? Zero confidence CEO can grow VVV stock value?Fact 1: VVV has zero stock value growth since IPO. Fact 2: Today the ENTIRE stock market is flying significantly high EXCEPT the VVV stock value. Solutions: Need new CEO (CEO needs to return self-enrichments). Need an active VVV buyer to clean out the place, speed up oil change competitor purchases and halt fruitless marketing campaigns."
shares I purchased today will close in the GREEN! Tomorrow I will be ready to buy the dip. For 2019 this represents the easiest buy for me so far this year. So very happy!
Great news!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"All markets and stocks were higher EXCEPT VVV due to the ""run to the ATM (investors pocket book)"" which was setup by VVV and ASHLAND management decisions. - Self-enriched themselves and betrayed IPO investors with nothing but negative value for IPO investors. ASH stock was way up today (in celebration of the enrichment?). VVV needs to be purchased by an active investor and cleaned out from the top. Business model is great. Stock value history reflects where management values are."
VVV reached an all time low at 9.89
"Great product/history, right market at a great time (drivers keeping cars longer, electric cars not surging, etc.). Price reflects lack of spine and too much bad greed."

"Good move up , next week looks promising"
"Thanks to all the year-long decisions that appear to have ensured wealth, growth and a release of liabilities FOR ASH! Results on VVV value are a continuation of NEGATIVE growth since IPO and now the dubious status of “Valvoline is Now Oversold (VVV)“ …. in a booming stock market … How did we get here? Could it be no one ELSE wants to LOSE money investing in a 150-year-old brand and reputation that’s spiraling downward after only 365 days with this helm? FYI: VVV centric decisions would have focused on VVV growth whose value would have EASILY been in the mid to high 30s by now for EVERYONE. You paying attention or even Care?"

It is pretty clear that VVV/ASH is the worst IPO investment I've ever made. Plain and simple.
"Happy with insider buying , would like to see some upward momentum"
still gas in the tank
Valvoline is up 5.71% to 30.72
So what was wrong with the earnings report?
"By definition, an investment EXPECTS a positive growth. Since the 2016 IPO, the price value curve shows a continual loss, currently at -15% and continuing yet the CEO continues to speak of long-term growth as was done in the latest earnings call. Over the previous year … while investors were losing monies, decisions self-enriched the CEO and friends along the way starting with the IPO. e.g. The millions in share value recently awarded to VVV management, $1 billion initial loan, $900 million ASH pension fund now being funded by VVV, conversion of 170 million ASH held shares to VVV shares, etc. Because VVV management only allows pre-screened scripted questions during the call and does not respond to investor email. I’ll post some real world questions here. WHAT is being done to GROW share value NOW? When will “long-term” become NOW?I strongly believe VVV needs to be brought out and the current VVV management needs to be ousted and held financially accountable for the past. The New CEO needs to be transparent, allow real word questions on the earning call and to reply to email from investors. The New CEO needs to have and report on a pipeline of candidates willing to sell their oil change locations. The New CEO needs to execute to plan and be financially tied to execution of the plan."
think your Wong
and here come the upgrades
Valvoline is up 5.24% to 22.90
report was good but AHS report wasn't
A lot of mutual funds and institutions hold this stock since December 2018. I feel this is a good sign especially with all the expansions of VVV quick lubes. This might be worth longing and if not I know where to go for a quick lube if this screws me in the end.
"I'm hoping ASH/VVV management does NOT mirror making VVV stock land on the ""2017 WORST Performer"" list like it did in 2016."
VVV reached an all time low at 9.68
Who ready for $25 after earnings?
"I'm very disappointed in the performance of the VVV stock price. Feels like open market share holders are a piggy bank. I'd feel differently if the lower prices were causing larger shareholders to respond to the BUY ratings but I don't see any evidence of that. Feels like my open market buy is being ""held in"" until ASH can dump 150 million shares into the piggy bank."
"It will be a sight to behold how VVV manages to rebuild trust after ASH finishes destroying all trust of IPO share buyers. ASH put VVV in $1B debt, drives down the open market price then takes a dump on VVV at first earnings release. Can't help feeling sorry for ASH shareholders longer term. Clearly shows ASH has trouble around the oval table."
"Just bought 100 shares at $22.85. Then it went down to $22.80. Now $22.76. I have a lot of faith in this company since I take my cars to Rapid Oil Change. But why can't I get just a little break when I buy a stock??? Oh well, I can go long with this one if I have to. Even Electric Cars need some oil.... :-)"
"Lease cars are required to have their oil changed or invalidates these cars if something happens with major engine repairs, Since the Corona.Virus and all cars sitting and not driving need their cars tires checked and fluids changed which makes the case for Valvoline!"
VVV is up 6.27% to 21.45
VVV reached a new All Time High at 25.63
watch the dip Friday. I will be looking to increase my position. A bounce is absolutely coming.
This is was I was waiting for. Beat estimates!!
Valvoline Inc. (VVV)Annual Report Available on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0001674910-19-000209/
this is for stocks not a puny $10 million dollar settlement for $4.56 billion dollar company.
"VVV IPO is clearly a well planned piggy bank for the parent company, insiders and underwriters. I guess that is far more enriching than executing business plans and earning shareholder trust."
Anyone have rational explanation as to why VVV is showing weakness?
Valvoline is down 5.10% to 23.72
Sold for $22. Had to lock in the profit.
"G: I think you've have good insight. Today's price (21.00) proves the insight. I am long now and headed to the exit when I can. It's clear the VVV IPO was rigged..""slated to the insiders and underwriters with a built-in value of 12-18 months"". Just plain old self-centered greed in action. An aggressive IPO management like VVV would be on a buying spree or something that demonstrates serious intent to the shareholders to do well and lead the pack. IPO is that opportunity to free management up to do just that. We will see evidence when they announce the first earnings and the next few thereafter and if all the analysis is worth the digital paper it is stated on. I suspect the analyst got paid too. - I am long on VVV by force and hate being punished for believing VVV had what it takes to be invested in. - just my two cents based on my pocket book and their pocket book. For the life of me I can't figure out why ASH would de-value their 150 million shares. Maybe greed has consumed them completely? All thought are welcomed."
This stock looks like a WINNER...
glad to see this holding up strong against the market downturn.
ouch ! $17.73 down 22.47% 2:47 pm
We should see pop for dividend declaration
Welcome to VVV Message board
Damn this stock trades like a Bond.

"VVV CEO compensation should be tied to VVV stock value performance since the 2016 IPO.Check out the ALPHA report on “ASHLAND SLY…” move. - Yet another question about Integrity and Value. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4076029-ashlands-sly-move-spun-valvolineThe run by the self-enriched on the ATM (investors) continues this week. The next VVV earnings call should speak about the CEO compensation, slick ASHLAND move article and run on the ATM."
Fact: The self-enriched stampede to the ATM continues for the second week in a row. - - -Millions of shares per day being cashed in. VVV management is well on their way to making VVV stock a “2017 Worst Investment” candidate for two years in a row for their 2016 IPO Shareholders. Zero growth (nothing but losses).
"Oh boy! I’ve been saying so for months. This latest news could have been easily avoided. Now a Dec. 10 article makes it common knowledge that ""VVV"" is in the top three ""Worst IPOs of 2016"". No surprise to IPO Shareholders like me given the price history so far. History is totally upside down from what it could be. Good news is ... VVV can EASILY become the ""awakened sleeper"" I believe it is if management would wake up and manage the perception of the VVV value. I’m not seeing any sign they even care … outside their inner circle."
"It has been six months since IPO and VVV management has not grown share value above its $24 IPO price for more than three artificial consecutive days. History: $1b loan against VVV before going public, $24 overpriced IPO shares and now a dump of 135 million shares at below $23.VVV management has not grown share value. The internet stock investors is their piggy bank..... pure and simple. Avoid this management unless you are rich enough to be an active investor and clean up the place."
I'll nibble on VVV pretty drastic drop for a low beta mover
Rising on weak market. Institutional buying?
I have been using them for 5 years and so has my friend... and we have had 0 issues with their service. great company.
Hello??? Any expectations for earnings?
VVV reached an all time low at 11.94
who the hell keep selling this great stock. buy buy buy
VVV is a brand of oil and they have great commercials. But I think most people are less impressed by an oil brand for the most part. And retail sales of oil are not going to be as affected by crude prices as much as gasoline is. But the Rapid Oil Change franchise is above average in my eyes as a customer. That's why I invested in VVV at $22 a share. I too am disappointed that this IPO has not taken off and I am sure there are a number of reasons. But I think the main one is that most people just don't know as much about this company as they should. I am expecting a nice dividend will turn things and people recognize this company for what it really is.
VVV is down 9.12% to 15.34
Long VVV!!!
VVV is up 5.86% to 16.80
VVV is up 6.23% to 10.92
Reached yet another new 52 week price low today.VVV/ASH should seriously consider rewarding IPO shareholders a .5 per 1 (the .5 would become fully vested in 4 months).
VVV is down 5.09% to 16.58
VVV is up 18.81% to 21.35
Load the boat. Contactless oil changes are the future.
Valvoline is down 5.01% to 22.75
VVV is up 6.39% to 11.65
Looks to be improving?...
New low $ 20.55. IPO $ 22 that's a 7% drop from IPO
"I mean absolutely no disrespect with this commentary, but I do not understand with the current climate of the automotive lubrication business, why I would want to own VVV stock. OEM's extending drain intervals on all products reducing consumption; the quick oil change/service center business not a growth market; VVV competitors integrated and able to adjust product costs to any situation; to name a few. The only reason I would consider purchasing VVV would be if the IPO was the long awaited mechanism to enable acquisition by CVX, XOM, COP, etc.."
VVV reached an all time low at 15.34
"Yep, what a waste at initial offering. Hopefully, ITLR, it will perform!"
I think $15 is fair value
VVV is up 9.49% to 12.98

Any ideas what to expect next week? Pretty stagnant today.
You (ASH/VVV) just GAVE 170 million shares to yourselves (insiders and friends) resulted in 4.3% price drop this morning because of yet another money grab for yourselves. You even paying attention? This what your morning earning call meant saying you are FOR shareholder value? Are you kidding me?
