Hello??? Any expectations for earnings?
A lot of mutual funds and institutions hold this stock since December 2018. I feel this is a good sign especially with all the expansions of VVV quick lubes. This might be worth longing and if not I know where to go for a quick lube if this screws me in the end.
Hello? Anybody here? Guys?
glad to see this holding up strong against the market downturn.
"Lease cars are required to have their oil changed or invalidates these cars if something happens with major engine repairs, Since the Corona.Virus and all cars sitting and not driving need their cars tires checked and fluids changed which makes the case for Valvoline!"
"Ouch, that is going to hurt for someone. Is this stock really not worth at least 20? Wth"
This stock looks like a WINNER...
I have been using them for 5 years and so has my friend... and we have had 0 issues with their service. great company.
LONG!
