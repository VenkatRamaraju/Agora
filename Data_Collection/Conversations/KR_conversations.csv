"""Sense .... This drop makes none"""
This is the exact scenario that Buffet looks for. No doubt BRK will be purchasing.
Days like this our a gift to buyers. Whole Foods is such a small footprint to Kroger. This is a blip on the radar. I took advantage and added to my position
"How can you compare KR to Walmart, Target , CVS and especially Strarbucks. KR is a pure grocery play. When they actually have a good portion of the store selling non food items then I'll agree. But Starbucks give me a break people."
Kroger beats earnings estimates again
For fun I checked at guru focus's discountant cash flow model for Kroger. Intrinsic Value = Future Earnings at Growth Stage + Terminal Value = $58.06. Kroger is a $40.
Fall winter is here. cases are rising. People are lining up to stock up groceries/toilet papers/meat. KR has streamlined its digital and curbside pickup. Next 6 months looking up. Should be 35+ anytime.
"Only a matter of time before Amazon gets out of grocery business. I don’t even understand why they want to be in it. It’s super competitive, with high labor costs, low margins and what not.Kroger, on the other hand, needs to open more Fred Meyer stores all over the USA. Those are awesome, and Fred Meyer Club format could adopt Costco model, which is proven to be pure gold.This stock is a keeper, and this price is really funny."
"09:45 AM EDT, 06/18/2020 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We lift our 12-month target by $3 to $40, 14x our FY 20 EPS estimate and in line with KR's 10-year forward mean. We lift our FY 20 EPS estimate to $2.86 from $2.38 and FY 21's to $2.75 from $2.40. KR posts May-Q adjusted EPS of $1.22 vs. $0.72 (+69%), $0.08 above consensus. Identical sales (ex-fuel) spiked 19% (digital sales grew 92%), adjusted gross margin grew 44 bps and adjusted EBIT of $1.45B grew over 50%. KR pulled its previous FY 20 guidance due to Covid-19 uncertainties but expects to exceed its previous outlook. We maintain our Buy as an elevated level of food-at-home demand should continue through 2020 due to the pandemic and recession. KR's mix of low prices and use of rewards/promotions/coupons should fare well during a weak economy. Lastly, grocery e-commerce growth is poised to accelerate from the Covid-19 pandemic, in our view, and we believe KR's investments in e-commerce (KR's first highly automated customer fulfillment center is set to open in 2021) will help it gain market share."
Since I need to abide by Yahoo's PC guidelines so I have nothing to say.
Buffet is is Kroger. Watch prices of items in Kroger stores start to be priced higher. Buffet owned companies mark up prices on items.
KR a monster now since Buffet owns 8%. 30.6 billion is the revenue to beat. Margins are tight since goods cost increased dramatically. May be miss on EPS and beat on revenue. Kr dominates Walmart in quality of food. Associates are happy at Kroger versus unhappy at Walmart. Late day selling to trick longs to sell. They already know if a beat or not. Buffet gets the call a week ago.
35.69 is the next support level down. Watch and learn how it hits and bounces off this level.
Goldman downgrades KR on May 4 from 37/share to 31/share.....then purchases 1.7mm shares on June 30th @ 38/share. Why is that? Seems odd! What changed so drastically from May 4 to June 30 to persuade them to purchase so many shares above their price target?
"Reduce my position in KR in the closing today. I bought KR when Amazon bought Wholefood and continued to buy into each oversold weakness. With my luck, KR probably pops next week. If not, I will get back into it. Good luck to long."
Looks like earnings are going to be monstrous!
Berkshire increased their stake by 20% in the second quarter.
"KR GREAt NEWS : """" Kroger is prepared to begin Covid vaccinations at its pharmacies, CEO saysPUBLISHED THU, DEC 3 20205:57 PM ESTUPDATED THU, DEC 3 20206:06 PM EST..Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told CNBC the grocer was “ready and anxious” to distribute coronavirus vaccines at its pharmacies.“We’re definitely prepared. It’s something that we’ve been working [on] with state and federal government for weeks,” he said.The nation’s largest supermarket chain also operates almost 2,000 pharmacies in 37 states.""""KR sell-off was over done and over reacting... The additional revenue from the COVID 19 vaccinationswill produce so much business and while the customers there to get vaccinated, they will buy consumerstaples products also..... I will accumulate more KR shares at this deep discounts....Expect KR to go backto at least $35 by YE2020..."
BS from Deutschland Bank
"Looks like this afternoon will be good time to buy some shares of KR at a discount. If people read the report and didn't just look at a couple of numbers (the wrong numbers at that), they'd realize Kroger crushed it in Q2."
Another beat long and strong
Buying more shares today! Hope it will go to $45 soon!
Core holding IMHO.
In Washington today - Fred Meyer (KR) parking lot packed - look forward to earnings and more!
"KR is my biggest holding and WAS up 28% YTD. It tends to move up on bad days for the market and in days like this, goes down in a good market. With a dividend yield of about 2% and a PE near 14, it is a safe and productive holding that will hold up when the market (overpriced), finally corrects. For those looking for a sound, safe and long term rewarding position, you could do far worse than KR."
dont get too excited20 billion in debt and razor thin margins 1%only 2 billion in cashthis stock barely cracks buffets top 25 holdings kroger can't raise prices above competition
"PE ratio under 9? insane. Lowest PEG ratio compared to competition.Even BGS trads @ 13x earnings, and higher PEG ratio. Operating profit of almost $800mm in Q3. Online sales up 110%. Sales growth without fuel sales up 10%. Solid Institutional ownership and Berkshire increased their position in Q3....Why has no one bought out this company. Even @ 12x the value of this company is $38-$40 per share. TGT trades @ 25x, Walmart @21x earnings, BGS @ 13x, DG @ 21.57x, costco @ 37x.Additionally KR buying back it's own stock again."
"Updated guidance, sales up 25%To put that 25% figure in context, Kroger executives had provided guidance as recently as March 5 that Kroger’s identical-store sales would rise at a pace greater than 2.25% for the year."
"I’ve worked for Kroger over ten years. In my situation I don’t plan on selling my stock for many years so these low prices are a good thing for me. However, in my honest opinion the stock is grossly undervalued right now so I keep piling it up in my 401k at the maximum purchase allowed while I sit back and collect my dividends for now. The one fact nobody seems to talk about is the Ocado partnership and the robotic warehouse facilities under construction as we speak. They will be a game changer in digital grocery sales. I wish I could predict when the rocket will take off but I can’t so it’s best to get on board and stay there so you don’t miss the ride. It is going to be a wild one!"
ex-dividend is 11/12/2020.......holidays are here.......people still have to eat......KROGER earnings in December.......it's all GOOD guys......hold your shares!!
"I will be going Long KR a little later today, with a lot of shares, before market close today. With Earnings coming out later this week, I am expecting KR to trend up ahead of the ER, then to come in with very good ER numbers, resulting in a 3-6% upside pop in direct response to the ER. The supermarket sector has thrived the past few months and this will continue. Common sense says that eating or just getting food from a restaurant, staffed by minimum wage, mostly young workers with little sense of personal responsibility as to hygiene, is more risky than buying food at a supermarket and being able to sanitize it at home. Restaurant dining will fall and these people gotta eat. They will be buying more stuff from supermarkets. Just as important, keep in mind that Kroger sells a full supply of cleaning products, and you can be sure these sales will have greatly increased. This is a safe play with very little downside risk. I will be looking for a pop to the $35-$37 level."
Looks like Warren Buffet bought more.
We sure do live in strange times. Stocks like KR who have improved financials during the CV19 and have proven to do well during recessions are going down. All while stocks on the verge of bankruptcy are going up 9% or more. I guess it's a product of self investing. I would hate to be a financial advisor right now.
"Is Yahoo Finance in cohorts with Jim Cramer since they can't even get the EPS correct on this board, they continue to list $1.69 after earnings while reading every where else it was $2.04? Makes you wonder if they are not trying to keep Kroger down also. Get it right Yahoo."
what a wonderful day. Hold on to your shares and enjoy the ride!
Wasn't expecting growth like this this year...but I'll take it.
Kroger has been experiencing a “whipsaw” pattern. Seems the day traders are still playing in KR right now.
How many of you feel Kroger will have spectacular earnings on June 21st ?
"Thumbs up to Kroger for taking a stand on forced pay increases. The message is clear that when expenses exceed revenue businesses close. Labor is a huge part of most small businesses, if not the largest expense. When politicians decide to force businesses to pay more the results are LOST jobs and local economic growth. This is fact not politics."
"I felt the market already wanted this one to go down on earnings anyway. It's had a pretty good run over the last 3 months, and they felt we were ahead of our skis. But I thought earnings were good, they are great place to pass on inflationary costs, so safe moving forward too. I ended up buying 1/3 more, you don't tend to get irrational negativity on good stocks too often, so a good buying opportunity."
$KR Target Raised by Northcoast Research Buy USD 46 » USD 49 Target Raised by Wells Fargo Accumulate » Equal Weight USD 39 » USD 46
been buying puts the whole way up with dates past earnings. this thing will fall back to earth when it reports inflation cutting into their razor thin margins...
"the new Kroger rule limiting the number of customers aloud in at a time doesn't affect my location. Under normal circumstances over 600 can enter. during the limiting period 309 can enter including employees. sure we're busy. If we ever get 150 customers in at one time. our store would be packed, with no more parking available."

It appears that Amazon is having a tough time making the Whole Food Acquisition work. Wall Street won't admit there is a problem because they are in love with Amazon. Eventually they will learn that Amazon is a house of cards.
This is going to 30’s today
"I am going to be selling short a lot of shares of KR before market close today. as a Pure Earnings play. This stock is clearly and obviously over-valued and should sell off significantly tomorrow, Friday, in direct response to a weak/disappointing earnings release. Depending upon how bad the release is, a 5-10% share price drop seems likely to me."
"The cycles of history. Speed of information. Speed of delivery. The pony express was the fastest machine of delivery from point A to B. Then speed of information, the telegraph. Planes. The internet. Back to speed of delivery. Amazon is building the infastructure. Do you actually think Kroger with their robotic distribution warehouses they are building out with all that time and investment and risk is being done just to shave a few tenths on a 1% margin game? Y'all cant see past the next rap video. WAKE UP. Kroger is branching out to the speed of delivery game within the amazon infastructure and theres nothing Amazon can do about it. Amazon and others will have to pay a premium for the roll out in those kroger territories. Kroger revenue anually will be at the TRILLION mark eventually when combining inflation trajectory at the coming velocity.The money doesnt exist, its just a numbers game now. Yep, 150 a share Kroger, the iPhone32 will be 5600$ but youll be able to fly your car by 7g wire plugged into your front gold grill diamond tooth mang'."
Kroger will be packed with New Years and all that stimulus money. Buy groceries and buy the stock.
"When the others tank because of the 2nd corona wave, KR will shine."
Looks like taking profits on this one a few weeks ago was a mistake! :)
Doubled my position at the close today at $41.10. Now 1500 shares with a $43.22 average
"In all seriousness, I hop KR moves upward in the coming days as I have a pretty hefty position. Keeping the faith!"
"I still believe in Kroger, this could go down, up, stagnant, holding and reinvesting dividends and eating food from Kroger."
Guess it’s time to sell now and then buy back cheaper.
"With all the good news about grocery stores, and specifically about KR, I don't understand why these shares went down so much yesterday? I am missing something, anyone know something? Thanks in advance."
THE FALL IS SKYING
"despite all the pandemonium going around, I was able to walk in to Kroger yesterday, get my prescriptions, and groceries in a very short time as usual. There was a nice selection of everything, shelves, produce, and meats were all stocked very well. Props to Kroger, you got it down !"
"Four trading days ago this peaked at $42.99 which was way overdone. Since then it is down 24% which is way overdone in my opinion. This should be bottoming soon and recover a little before heading back into a tighter, more stable trading range. Here is hoping as a long!"
Did warren Buffett buy this stock before all this noise?
"Kroger you need to know your competition. Walmart Clicklist pickup is free over $30.00 purchase. KR Can't compete with charging 5.00 bucks to free. And customer complaints about produce selection given to online shoppers. So, again Walmart has advantage. And some say Walmart online shopping is more user friendly. Might want to improve these things too. Just trying to point out what is obvious to management. And at least advise store managers that only have high school education about Stock market and incentives for associates buying stock and improve business skills of managers."
Bought 400 shares at $42.00. I like bargains
"I wish they could sell more of this stock, so I would buy more"
Top consumer staple stocks-Glad to see KR on the list for 2020 with a much higher price target.
Managers made fantastic bonuses during covid hoarding. Employees some of the best people you'll ever meet. Friendly and courteous to customers. The wages are great and the store products fresh and priced fairly Kroger is well run business and the analyst price target is off at 33. Add 8 to that and you're buying a good stock value. Remember Gamestop shorts. It can happen here.
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Multistockalerts.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
Love Kroger service and prices just picked up $180 order today and got a free Turkey. This stock has no where to go but up and I am adding to my holdings. I have used Walmart pick up also and it is a little more user friendly and has great service also. I am 30 Miles from Walmart and only 5 Miles from Kroger store. Kroger you need to advertise your pick up and delivery service more. Long IMO term KR will be $100 stock.
This stock is undervalued especially compared to the broader market.
"Just wondering if other investors feel there is any long term motivation to hold onto this stock. I'm down 28% since purchase. It seems to continually drop, even in up markets. It's down to where it was in May of last year, with an 18% drop in 11 days."
anyone here know why the big drop? It does not make sense to me - topline/bottom line all beat and guideline also boosted.
Selloff isn’t surprising... but they were already trading very cheap for a defensive holding. When the market eventually gets a big haircut money will flow right back. Food is a need.
I expect eps to get to atleast $1 this quarter and likely stay in that range the next couple quarters. For those who think the recent buying surge is borrowing from future sales I think you’re dead wrong. This is about a change in consumer behavior. Gone are the days of going out to dinner one or two nights a week. With more families having more meals at home it will only add to the demand at local grocery stores. Not to mention with all the layoffs folks just wont have the same disposable income. This is a buy and hold in my opinion.
"Well for me I almost never went to a grocery store, now I am spending $400 a month, which may not be much but at least double what I was spending Pre-Covid. Also I have seen prices run a lot higher, I don’t know if that because distributors are charging more, an increase in hourly labor, just hikes to get a bettor handle on price margin( or all the above) hopefully since I own the stock It would be nice to generate higher profit margins now and get ahead of the game. Also Warrens extra vote of confidence means he is happy with the direction KR is moving. I just don’t see him adding here unless the numbers are going to be very favorable since this is such a tough business."
A safe company.
"Old funny buffet shorting Kr ahead of ER this week. Miss is likely and margins slim on higher cost for goods. Labor wages are not keeping up with inflation. Consumer stock sell off this week ahead of weak employment data again. 48 was a total fluke on short covering. Kroger doesn't own any of its stores, merely a tenant to write off expenses of leases and shrink. Better merchandise than walmart though. Target over valued lemon stock. All will be corrected this month downward. thanks to libs in house."
I will be in at 35.
nobody goes to Kroger stores anymore. their always too crowded.
Most analysts raised the targets for KR including Goldman Sachs. KR will rise and the avenger is back!!!
Good report. Why KR is down in pre-market?
Long term stock for 50 years. It is good to own part of a company you shop at for groceries.
"read the news!!!Kroger Co. KR, +1.21% has moved into the top 10 of U.S. e-commerce companies, according to eMarketer, landing at number 9."
"I've got 3K+ shares that says Warren Buffet isn't selling KR in the face of these downgrades. I hold to that position based on the following:1. Their rewards program is meaningful and, when paired with fueling centers, 'sticky' for their customers.2. Their Simple Truth brand is comparable to name brands while delivering better margins.3. Their eCommerce presence is experiencing explosive growth.4. COVID-19 will be with us for much longer than people anticipate."
"This will go between 30 to 34 and if it can break 34 will get to $40. I see this happening as demand has spiked and will continue to be up as the pandemic plays out. Our restaurant industry is going to take a long time to recover- people are going to be cooking at home a lot more as they have been the past few weeks. Kroger has its own in house brand of food and also is active in community out reach. Not only will it gain monetary value but Kroger’s social/community value (and therefor consumer loyalty) will also be affected in a positive way. Add into that their progressive policies which match the new generation’s Ethos (LGBTQ+ rights, organic options, eco friendly business designs and feeding local communities and children through their no hunger campaign) - the longevity of this company is solid. Not to mention the immense amount of real estate they own and operate on. In summary my feeling is $30 is a fair price. Anything under that is a definite buy. It might bounce between $30-34 for a while before breaking out towards $40. Long for sure."
This is going higher. Sector rotation taking place.
The market Hayes KR otherwise it would be $40+ already. They need to buyback stock
$50 coming?
"Kroger is huge in the south, and that’s exactly where the growth is these days. People flocking out of the NE and mid west to the Carolinas GA and FL."
45 call for 9/17 Easy money
Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen treats his store workers so badly thatit's hard to shop at his grocery stores. Now it's the Chao - McConnell connection on the board of directors that worries me some more. I have already sold my KR stock and now it's learning to shop at TGT and ACI until next year. Then we shall see what happens after the stock holders vote.
"30M shares traded today, more than 3 times three month daily average. Should be $45-$50 stock....great earnings this week would help the charge in that direction."
"How many ""Smart Money"" analysts said to sell KR after the AMZN-WFM plunge? How many of those are saying to buy now?"
"The street is clueless, and is thereby offering a sale on KR stock. The two Kroger stores that I frequent in my area are crazy busy whenever I stop in. Multiple checkout lanes (+ self checkout) with at least three people in each line - sometimes 4X that. And that doesn't even include the online pickup orders. When the street finally figures out that COVID isn't going away anytime soon, and that Kroger is performing better than its big box peers, this sale will end."
I expect Kroger to test $30 in a few months. Could happen sooner if earnings and revenue beat.
"Tariffs or no tariffs, people will still go to KR. Recession or not, people will be eating...they won't be going to Whole Foods, that's for sure. People will still be using their rewards and filling up their tanks at KR as well. This is where you want to be when the storm comes."
So close to a huge breakout! Need a strong close !
"Placed another Home Delivery order today and everything worked great. I love my local Kroger Store. At 81 Years old, it makes life simple. Order on time and a wonderful young lady that did the shopping and delivered treated us great. Warren Buffet, you know your stuff!"

"I recently went into a whole foods store for the first time and it will be the last time. Their prices are double if not triple the costs at other grocery stores. Regarding buying groceries online, I do not get it. When I go shopping I normally buy a fressh vegitable and fruit. I cannot imagine someone else knowing how to pick for me. One other thing, If I were to order online, then when my food is delivered it would be sitting outside either in 90 degrees temp in the summer or 20 degrees or colder in the winter. I don't get it LOL."
"Looks like Coronavirus action again, with folks planning on stocking the pantries. Love my Kroger stock!"
@KR: Waiting for the Booster shot to be authorized and announced by the White House and followed by KR's news because KR has pharmacy in each supermarket it owns that would provide the vaccination services. Their Covid 19 vaccination services that they contracted with the government in early 2021 wouldprovide them much bigger revenue and very profitable. I got an email from my health insurance that any patient that needs a booster shot will be covered when needed that authorized by their primary doctor.Not sure why KR stock has been selling off 4 straight days why all consumer staples food stocks are mostly green today due to market rally. What is happening to KR stock... It is so oversold in the last 4 days... and overdue for rebounding soon.
Adding adding
"KR --Kroger is down again this morning. I think some analyst have mis-understood about the investor 's day announcement. KR would have saved so much money on digitally. All digital coupons have been used andproven very effectively and cost savings. There no more paper coupons as they need to hire the backroomassociates to sort and mail to manufactures (MFG) for rebates. They can also tract all sales items by MFG get rebates fast from the MFG. In addition, the company's automated warehouse ""sheds"" provided by partner Ocado Group(OCDGF) will be as profitable as in-store models by their fourth year on an Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) basis.I expect KR stock price will come back to at least $37.50 by next week and KR is heading back to $42 near term. Take advantage of today's sell off and start accumulate more KR shares while collecting a nice dividend.. Warren Buffett has invested heavily into KR. ""Patience and Persistence are keys of winning""."
Nothing makes sense anymore. This news story below clearly says that most people have shifted from buying coffee from Starbucks and is now making it at home. So then why is SBUX outperforming KR by 10 times?
Has anyone read through Albertsons recent earnings? Kroger will have a blow out quarter. Finally some food inflation. The spreads have widened and Kroger’s margins have too. Buffett owns Kroger for good reason.
"I’ve held this stock for 5 years, it’s basically like holding cash."
"Just went Long 3200 shares of KR at $31.98. Looking for a Green day tomorrow as traders and investors realize that the ER is coming up, and that KR should handily beat consensus estimates on both EPS and Revenue, as well as provide good Guidance going forward. Not sure if I will be holding this one through the actual ER, gotta see how things look tomorrow, checking out some other trading opportunities. But I am planning to stick with KR at least until the afternoon tomorrow."
Cramer last update on how to play the market next week. He mentioned to sell Kroger. I’m not sure that’s right. Kroger near me always busy and business seems to be going good and they are always hiring.
"citadel shorting this on every buy. funny man Buffet needs to step up. Oh yea he's shorting to. Dementia though he can't remember just chuckles. Kr margins shrinking but eating at home a necessity with Delta pandemic. Mask orders in Ohio, Pa and WV yesterday. School closings are coming next. 41.50 is too cheap. 2600 great stores with over 450K associates. Administration vaccine program by KR great benefit for public in communities. Loyal to brand of KR. value and quality."
watch out 41 is the loony tune buffet strike price. Shorts American food and jobs for $$$$. Billionaires are all the same. Tax them to the maximum AOC and Sanders. Kroger is necessity and should be 50 a share on revenue and earnings beat last quarter. No way will it be though. Bait and hook set over 41 today. Triple witching day today.
"If Kroger tries to start a immunization passport check in their stores, understand they will lose business and set themselves up for lawsuits for potentially violating HIPAA."
"KR reminds me to Target a few years ago where they focus on improving operations and the stock went from 80 in 2018 to around 245 today. KR working on delivery, automation, robotic warehouse, restock initiative, etc. I would not be surprised if they are above 50 in less than a year when those benefits become more a parent"
It will be dropping soon
Amazon spends money to compete the stock goes higher. Kroger spends money to compete and the stock gets crushed.
"Amazon makes gnat food profits and they are saints, KR will make real profit $2 per share and the hedgies sell anyway. SEC needs to start check side accounts of program sellers."
This thing is finished
This Co. Is ready for liftoff!
right on the dot for Berkshire Hathaway short fund. 41$ No reason to worry it will rise soon. All elective surgery has been cancelled on the East Coast. Covid variant is much worse than being told. FDA turns down booster shot on political lines. Get the shot if you can if your elderly. Next 3 months shutdowns will be occuring in schools and businesses. Travel limited as well. The markets are phony. Billionaires running the prices to what ever they profit on. Tax tax and more tax on elites.
Renaissance Technologies greatly increased its position in Kroger. To me this is far more important than WB's position.
Consumer staples sector has been either IN FIRST or SECONDS performance in all sectors this morning.There are some interest in the sector because it has been oversold since Tuesday this week....I ambuying this stock at this deep discount value. Warren Buffett has added KR to his core holdings....
"Sector rotation and safe haven going to $KR and $GO as funds look for safety and market focus. UNFI isn't benefiting from any of this, as we were warned about CEO succession disarray and now the crippling results ( more than soft) of the current EXPO Food Show are very telling . August 1st marks the 4 year anniversary of the 'infamous 1 for 7 reverse stock split' of Supervalu which was key to the UNFI takeover. This concludes one of the most shady and villainous eras of the food distribution space in recent memory. Less than two weeks to go in the FY and it is the 'Shoot out at the OK Corral', as either we name an elite 'outsider' to unlock shareholder value and MOVE ON ..... or more 'inside' do nothing- ism and more financial shenanigans."
Buffett bought a lot or two.
Picked up 400 shares sold the 24.5 call for next week
It's very odd that KR is not over $35. They have 2500 stores nationally. They have been insanely busy
KR hi tech facility called the HIVEhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fmVUIfAe6Ho
"Congrats to the people who have been long on this for a while. I've never liked the stock and shorted it often (luckily, I was not short today), but I'm glad to see some money made by the people who stuck around on this during the frustrating times it was range-trading."
"Buffet in the house, he always raise profit margins on items in his portfolio"
"I am definitely going to add more with each pay check, accumulate dividends and make a living out of this thing in a few years! great business model, ive never seen these stores empty"
"No more than 9 cents in either direction in the last hour...Sure ain't like yesterday, last week, last month, last year, last decade. Must be option week."
"Sold Short a lot of shares of KR just before market close today at an average price of $46.16. Very happy with my fill price and feeling confident this will go down significantly tomorrow, in direct response to her earnings release. There is no value at the $46+ level, even if KR beats EPS and Revenue consensus estimates. This should be trading at the $41/share level based upon meeting both consensus estimates. Good Luck folks!"
"Krogers not going anywhere, they r the leading grocer in term of sales ahead of wallmart & all the rest by a mile.. Amazon has just entered with whole foods which is also going nowhere & will not be able to compete with Kroger in any case..This is a normal trading pattern by MM. and will spike to 25.50 at least which is a 180 support level within 2 weeks..This is a defensive stock & if index goes lower this is guaranteed to rise.. Hold on & average down."
Kroger held up terrific today. Food and drug staples. Now Monday continuation or more head line news about tariffs. Still Walmart going to be raising prices making margins for Kroger better. Congratulations associates working hard to keep the doors open. And stock holders one of the same thing.
What happen to Kroger today. Kroger is best company and best produce then Walmart. Kroger stock should be $40
KR broke above 2015 highs. Blue skies ahead.
Have been following the bidding and valuation discussions of Morrison’s supermarket chain in UK. The perceived undervalue of the company related to their real estate holding value alone is interesting. Appreciate the solid income during potential future periods of secular stagnation (consumer staples). How is Kroger different than Morrison’s?
"Few people mention the run up from $17 to $42 between Feb 2014 and Dec 2015 which also included a two for one split...so after figuring in the split by doubling today’s price the stock stands at roughly $44 a share today theoretically. Most people don’t realize the magnitude of this Kroger/Ocado marriage and the competitive edge that will give Kroger. When these new robotic facilities are completed and operation full swing, I for one can’t see how Amazon or Walmart will compare. The Amazon scare that drove down Kroger stock is completely blown out of proportion if you ask me. It has no merit. Fake news. Now is the time to buy Kroger. Don’t delay. It may not completely explode for another year or two but one thing is for sure, it’s coming. I’ve been long on Kroger for well over a decade. I continue to buy more of it every year and I ride it up in the good times or bad collections my dividends along the way. Since 1883 Kroger has thrived through every world war and the Great Depression too. They’ve always figured out a way to win and that’s why they are number one in the grocery game. Kroger most definitely owns the most properties in the most prime locations, locations that if Amazon had to purchase today they could never compete due to the massive overhead the cost of real estate would bring. Kroger will make me rich in the end, I’m sure of that and I’m patient, I’m not going away and neither is Kroger ;)"
"Kr holds on a down day, high volume at the end."
This 80 Year old stock owner loves Kroger! Home delivery is great community support is great and parking lot is full all the time. stock has done well and in my opinion will continue to go up gradually and they will make Money and pay dividends. What more could you ask for in a Company? Bought and holding why sell.
I plan to hold this.
"Of all the people I trust for investment advice, Wells Fargo is nowhere on that list."
10% pull back and counting
"""they"" toots shorting and holding ""buffet"" want this at 42.00 and they can put it right there. Down 6 off recent high. Stalling/ shrinking margins the excuse for short selling. market on consumer staples lower on Walmart. But Target and Costco up. Buffet funny old short seller. Rodney on CNBC earlier didn't help. Discussing Kroger and Instacart are teaming up for a partnership called ‘Kroger Delivery Now’ .. Always Kroger is a safety play not phony cyber junk, risky bartering toy bitcoin. But millenials are dictating the market. Food irrelevant. NOT. Kroger should be up 2 bucks IMO."
split?
"i find it interesting that all these companies are scrambling with new gimmicks and toys to try and become what kroger ALREADY IS-- the largest grocer in the country with 2800 stores, multiple labels, 41 of their own processing plants, and BILLIONS in levered free cash flow. over time, kroger mows them all down."
"I already own Kroger, but check out new “Learn to Invest” YouTube video on Kroger. Based on discounted cash flow fair value of Kroger is 40$…"
Interesting to look at Walmart's yearly earnings vs. Kroger. Kroger: 121.16B and 3.11B in Earnings. Walmart: 514.41B and 6.67B in Earnings. This info is per the graphic that Yahoo puts on their page. Walmart sure has to generate a lot of sales to be a low price leader.
"OK, admittedly nothing makes sense in the market anymore. But a company with a single digit P/E, managable debt, a good dividend and a decent economic moat still has to be a decent buy, right?Right?Or is the new 'new' economy at full strength when only unicorns and banks are worth investing in?"
"funny how $32.80 seems like a victory and reason to celebrate..only a week ago we were all looking forward to $35 and higher...I'm still ticked at the CEO, better stay above $33 tomorrow...I'm not lowering my expectations."
not adding anymore since last year. already has enough % in my basket BUT feeling relatively safe at 32$/share. Its the passive income account so just letting it reinvest indefinitely. I love you KR
"Well I obviously don’t know as much as I think I do because I called everything right but the move in the stock. Sales up, profit up, guidance up, new tech coming up, and then you would think stock price up. I could see a pullback if we had a run-up pre earnings, but no we are trading at the bottom of the channel. GLTA I have cashed out of all stocks for now."
Grocery emptied as consumers buy groceries and not restaurants food. New high imminent
"Warren Buffett holds almost 62 millions shares of KR ( 1 of the top 3) of KR stocks...Rumors he just addedmore shares of KR recently....In the volatile markets, consumer staples is where the money managers willbuy and the KR is the greatest defensive stock, liquid with a nice dividend...."
"Ok, I’ve started reestablishing a long position in KR."
It’s amazing that one man Warren Buffet can make the stock move so much.
"Earnings were going to be through the roof already, then this arctic blast swept the nation, sending earnings out of the atmosphere. Truth is people are always going to prioritize groceries, natural disasters have been happening, and are going to happen more frequently. Forget about the shorts, this is one of the most solid stocks to hold for a very long time !"
KR annual dividend this year 72 cents with double-digit component growth! That is so impressive with certain reward under this economy. That's why most analysts raised the target including Goldman Schs for its business. KR should be at $35 now. Both technical view and valuation warrant the price!!!
Back to 28 in few months
"Possibly we should review all big-time/big-bank analyst calls on this stock over the years. They are not good at what they do....especially the ones who assumed grocery shopping was over/eating out was back late last year. Now, we have a report that household debt is back, so doubtful people will add to that debt by eating out more."
"KR prices are too high. The only time I shop there is when meat goes 50% off or twice a year when Progresso is priced at 99 cents so I can donate to the food bank. Otherwise Costco has everyone beat especially when they have markdowns each month on certain items like Clorox Wipes, Tide, Coffee, Cheese, Vitamins, etc."
Soon the only places that will have consistent revenues will be grocery stores
"As of 12/31/2020, KR Had over 75 million shares sold short.. one of the highest out there. We need everyone to take their GME profits and buy KR"
"Good luck longs, hoping we get a nice pop from earnings!"
Bought back options on 24.5 bought another 200 down here and sold 8 25 calls for next week
￼COVID or not Kroger is the best in class grocery store. That’s why I’m in it. Stock up
No reason for drop
"I'm not much on believing in what analysts say, but after seeing overall investor reaction to these things, one would think this would have helped.Ned Davis Research Group upgrades KROGER CO from NEUTRAL to BUY.BY Investars Analyst Actions - private— 6:06 AM ET 04/01/2019"
"What makes Kroger such an outstanding buisness over Walmart is that they both try to get customers information. Walmart tracks things like credit card, check, walmart card. Things like that. But Kroger knows exactly every customer cause of a discount card. Knowing the customer is number 1 in win customers."
"KR was the gift of the year. A true no-brainer. I was stuck on an aircraft on ""Amazon Day"" hearing all the doom and gloom on the seat-back monitor. I could not wait to land and get a trade in! As soon as I landed I logged in and purchased several thousand shares. Have not owned a grocer before. Will be holding this and passing it to my heirs."
"A few things not in the headlines on yet another solid but boring quarter (just how I like my stocks). Net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.79 vs 1.81. Not a huge change but going in the right direction and was already good to start with. Average number of common shares used in Diluted calculation 752m vs 780m. Thats KR retiring 110,671 shares every trading day the market was open on average last year (28m / 253 days). New $1 billion buyback approved replacing the one that ended last week. Excluding fuel, sales decreased 4.0% compared to the same period last year. Not nearly as bad as the doom and gloom shorts were talking about post covid. With the guidance this could very well get into the 40 this quarter IMO."
.45 earnings stock will be 50+ 4sure
My Wife loves Vita Cost owned by Kroger! Check it!
"$KR is the stock to own as the country heads into a recession. Consumers will delay or put off all other purchases except for essential items like groceries. Other companies will lose money but Kroger will make a profit. Its stock price will rise, while others will fall in the bear market."
KR. Look at upside call options.Sure they might report higher costs but huuuige windfall in revenues from stay at home plus higher margin goods. A buyback or div hike may be unlikely given a the bonuses etc. KR hits $36-38 then I'm out unless there is a surprise. I thought it would be closer to $36-$37 by now so a break of $40-$42+ seems highly doubtful
"25% increase in food stamps. KR will soon be a $50 stock. My prediction by end of Sept. Inflation in transitory....Haha, yeah right. Here's to you Wells Fargo and Goldman grocery retail analysts for getting paid, and have no clue what you're doing."
Bought 80 shares lol…
"Warren Buffett took a large position in KR as disclosed in his SEC filings earlier this year. During the Monday's sell-off this week, KR stock was UP big and I suspected that some big money managers tried to keep buying.....Would it be Warren Buffett group??Buffett??"
"Earning estimates have been going up lately, it started at .50 then went to .51 now .52 per share hope that means earnings will be a beat. Now if sales come in stronger then in past we could see a decent rise in share price."
Buffet has loaded up with more KR
"""These vaccines operate really well in protecting us from severe disease and death, but the big concern is that the next variant that might emerge — just a few mutations potentially away — could potentially evade our vaccines,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a Tuesday press briefing. ---- Looks like Kroger may come in handy again"
"KR---Analysts missed out about KR with 2000 pharmacies with the recent news that KR now working with 37 states and federal level to distribute and manage Covid 19 vaccines at its pharmacies.... The is a HUGH NEWS for KR...This translates into bigger REVENUE and bigger PROFITS, bigger EPS....KR is heading back to $37 by YE2020."
"Huge beat on revenue and earnings. Just the crooks shaking out weak hands. The analyst know KR has huge cash reserve, raised guidance. And the conference call was excellent. The back story is Buffet owning over 8% as the oracle from omaha knows a good stock. Regardless of the manipulation of short toots. Kroger can abd will make a fortune on stay at home eating habits due covid. Kroger far exceeds quality in their private selection brands. Marketing is great. Digital coupons and click pick doing terrific. This company is a buy at 42 for sure. Hold for 50 this year. Average associate make 21$ an hour with benefits added to salary. They are happy and customers are happy. Go Krogering today and buy Stock on sale."
"Is it the retail traders? Or big hands accumulating? The stock is kind of trading at a very low P/E and with the pandemic increase in comps, the operational efficiencies and automated warehouses they are building, seems to have some legit room to go to the mid 40’s."
"dividend increase was announced at the shareholder meeting , 18 cent"
Kroger needs to add a stock gift card at the check out lines.. buy a share for $35 and get a free chicken.....
"This stock price has fluctuated quite a bit considering it is a big grocer. I see the attractiveness in that the business has some basic stability in good times and bad; I see the basis for some relief associated with the reports on AMZN/WFM reducing their emphasis on low prices (allowing KR to raise prices slightly anyway). Seems that rise was overdone, and now a 5% drop (in KR, for goodness sake) as a correction? Or is there other news I am missing. On another note, it seems the online ordering/pickup/delivery is good and all, but that there will be a small minority of people using these services. So it's not like they need to change their business model overnight -- i.e., there's no crisis as long as they're focusing on good customer service, etc.I would love for the decline to continue for a bit more to be able to add less expensive shares for the long term -- KR seems like good ballast for a portfolio over the long term!"

"Kroger (Fred Myers store) did it again when I went to place an online order. When you try to buy an order from weekly sales add, you can not add it to your cart. I called the store, and they said to call, and they would add it after the order was placed. Just cancelled the order and ordered from Albert sons with no problem. I think it is time to sell my Kroger stock."
"Kroger was on an uptrend before covid, and is undervalued at this price covid or not. Their assets alone are worth at least twice the market cap"
$1200 stimulus money all going to food. Wmt KR AMZN
"@KR has been sold off 4 straight days after earnings released on Friday 9-10-2021. It was so oversoldand currently @KR is sitting in the oversold area. It is a defensive stock in any bad markets. @KR is an overlooked stock and it is due for a rebounding soon. If it closes at $42.25 at the close today, then it will rise to $43 near term."
I work for Kroger. things are booming and our store does really well. I have a great team at my store and our store is always busy. the company is changing quickly and hopefully better. I keep mythumbs up for mr buffet. thank you sir!!!
Merry Christmas to all the Kroger Stock Holders and a Happy New Year with a return to the mid 30s or higher in 2018.
Why is my defensive stock acting like a silicon valley growth stock? I don't see any news.
"Theft. Figures with the no law administration in, steal all you need."
"Things are going to start heating up for KR, sales are continuously strong, and they are doing great in keeping up with the digital space !"
I recently sold all Kroger stock over 40. I bought it in the low 20 range thinking it was worth 30. it's still worth 30.
52 week low and bargain basement sale time. I'm buying here. Food and drug good safe place to be.
The Kroger is up 4.90% to 45.58
Here in Michigan I have a relative who works at Kroger told me that sales were up 55% in the first week of this crisis. Shoppers aren’t concerned about price so much as getting the product. That means margin levels will be high and profit should be way higher. How is the stock trading about the same as before this crisis? It makes no sense to me! I’m going long for now! Please counter my optimism about Kroger based on what I may not know. I am new to Kroger stock.
"Added to my holdings this morning KR has the best home delivery, prices and parking lots are always full. They do everything Target does and look at the price of Target. Love the financial numbers including Free Cash Flow. No where to go but up with a little time."
"How is this not getting bought up after 4 months of selloff? This is the single biggest beneficiary on the market of lockdown and stimulus, and it’s wildly undervalued and oversold..."
Surprised we are down this much today!
"Kroger stock is a BUY, it's got a lot more to go. The anticipation of POSSIBLY positive earnings on Sept 13 is going to keep driving this rally. Said it a week ago, I'm reiterating today.Strong BUY."
Can Kr compete with Amazon? Is Amazon the new economy onto itself?
"Fun facts. 43 million shares were repurchased in FY 2020 (804M to 761M). There were 253 days the market was open or 169,960 shares disappeared each trading day in 2020 on average. 43m shares X .72 annual dividend = 31 million annual payment savings (about 4 cents a share a year) going forward in 2021+ and counting. Sometimes a lower price is not a bad thing long term. I went through this with TGT 4 years ago. It tanked to under 50 with a PE under 10 and was getting no love from Wallstreet so I got in around 48. Its stock repurchase just got ever more effective with the lower price and its Div and operating expenses were easily covered like KR. With dividends TGT has been a 4 bagger over the last 4 years. The coil spring on KR looks similarly tight. I am (seriously) fine if the price stays under 35 for a few more qtrs. Ill reinvest the Divs for extra cheap shares and let KR knock out more every day than I could hope to buy."
"Food inflation is the name of the game most Grocery Stores work on a set margin. Example Like 25% on wine. If wine is $10 store makes $2.5 if same wine goes to $12, store makes $3.00 that is %16.66 more profit. Food inflation is coming thanks to Uncle Joe.Increasing min wage, gas prices, increase in Corp tax ( which gets past on to us, (but no tax on anyone who makes under $400K) All will be reasons to raise prices.. so don't sell."
Thomson--Reuters just upgraded KR to strong buy with rating of 9 on their 10 point scale.
Have to see the impact of news from Amazon on further slashing prices at whole foods for prime members.
I suspect that Kroger gets a much better margin with Private Selection ice cream and they don't meed another ice cream manufacturing facility. Turkey Hill is just another brand to the customer. The strategy is to more and more store brands which are as good or better than national brands and lower in price.
We're not going to see $35. And certainly not going lower than that. kr will bounce back up at this discount price.
"Micro ultimately determines macro. I shop at Kroger on Research Forest Drive in the Woodlands, Texas. The store is always clean and shelves well maintained. The staff smile and are uniformly helpful. The prices are more than competitive when I use their coupons and buy their specials. Contrast that with your last trip to the chaos of Walmart or the smugness of Whole Foods. This company is a winner, even with the switch to online."
"The consumer staples food stocks are mostly up nicely today except KR stock.The news showed one insider exercised her stock option yesterday and her exercised stock option price of KR was at 24 and she sold during market sold off at 42.04, (bought and sold the same time) and pocketed a nice gain. She still holds approx. 120.000 shares of KR in her portfolio . This insider's trading news caused KR sell-off today.The sell-off is overdone and it should rebound soon..."
Clear shot to $50.
Not a shareholder but we shop at a pic n save. I know they have done market research but what is a reason they don’t make all stores Kroger?
"Analyst Robert Ohmes reiterated a Buy rating and $42 price target on Kroger on Friday. He also boosted his full-year fiscal 2021 earnings-per-share estimate to $2.80, from $2.35, after the company’s report came in much better than expected. This figure also takes into account mid- to high-single digit EPS growth for Kroger’s second quarter, as he believes the grocer will continue to see strong sales, even as Covid-related restrictions are lifted in many areas."
"KR ---Great business, good dividend and Warren Buffett has been buying KR as part of his core portfolio as disclosed in SEC filings. Not sure why KR was sold off today..."
Kroger does what Amazon does but the difference between KR and AMZN is KR take care of the crews and customers rather than taking advantage of them like AMZN. It is pain to watch free falling for the fear of Amazon but we will be fine.
"Raise dividend, buy backs, positive cash flow, and it keeps dropping! Now what? Keep buying!"
OK ER and where does the MM algo go? Back to 33.50 range. KR can become a community grocery store with neighborhood community appeal. Stand out as a leader of the towns. Happy workforce mostly and good prices. KR will do fine. Its very stable company and does its best to manage under the margins. Improvements and learning happening at least. Go Krogering
"KR is ripping the benefits of the most advanced Robotic warehouse now after 3 years in building the AI powered advanced warehouse. Check on Utube of their state of the arts facilities. Ocado advanced robotic warehouse is pushing the Kroger online sales to recorded numbers. It is just the beginning of efficiency gain and margin expansion. I would buy as many KR shares as possible just as I did the same when the Empire Company EMP-A.TO launched the robotic warehouse with Ocada. The results are very positive. The sales and margins keep increasing. As many insiders are buying KR stocks, I would say KR is a great buy. KR will continuously improve the earnings, margin and growth. EMP-A is a classic grocery chain example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_psDSX-7P1s"
"It appears that Kroger just recently bought back around 11,000,000 shares of stock."
"hello friends. i work for Publix and all i can say is you better be buying as much kroger stock as you can. at my store. shelves are getting filled and people are buying at-least 1-2 weeks worth of goods. this is great for all grocery retail stocks. it’s a win win. publix stock is at 48.90, is private and gets evaluated every quarter. kroger is a great buy for the next 2 quarters."
Too many people talking smack. I'm in to win! see you at the finish line. In it long!
Come on 52 week high
It seems Kroger dominates the pharmaceutical business in the US. That can’t be bad during a pandemic. Has to be a great quarter
Looking like we’re going to add to the gains.
"“kroger affirms eps of $3.20 per share and the stock drops. the equity environment is hostile. Sprouts farmers market reported eps up 100% in Q3 and stock dropped 5%. Sprouts and kroger are the same price as 1 year ago, but the marco environment has changed. these are rodney dangerfield stocks - no respect.” This happens all the time with value stocks, and then all of a sudden one morning value stocks will get a bid￼￼. Kroger has a PE of 12, Albertsons has a PE of 7. I can assure you that PE gap will close. It will. The analysts have been modeling the businesses with very low profit margins over the last 30 years. That is all about to change. My portfolio is heavily biased to the grocers and electric utility stocks in the SE."
Why the Drop ? Does someone know something ahead of tomorrow ?
Elaine C! On the board of directors. Boom! Winning! Cha Ching!
Kroger adds former serectary and lalor Elaine Chao to boards
KR is way undervalued! KR low-bound is reached and it will go up trend tomorrow! It will be KR's turn to catch up the historical market index!

"There was an article today online from Barron's where an analysts said Kroger stock could double by 2020, hope they know what they are talking about! That would be awesome!"
Kroger beat on top and bottom lines. .19 cent beat was terrific. I read someone said options scenario is holding it down today but at 11x earnings this company is very undervalued.
So they put Mitch McConnells wife on the board. NOT A GOOD MOVE. sold my position today
Grocery store with P/E of 28: Never thought I would see that in my lifetime.
KR should increase their dividend. Show some confidence. They're doing well in terms of sales.
I started today to buy this every time it is red. I am reinvesting the dividend. I will do this for three years.My buy is 50 shares each time I buy. In 3 years and one month I will be very happy.
Credit Suisse initiated coverage of Kroger with a outperform rating:)
Oh wow Warren Buffett bought 3 million more shares of Kroger looks like we're going through 36 on Monday
"Worth $34 BB, doubt it, double Amer Airlines, which is international !!"
Love my Kroger Stock long term Investor! No where to go but up!
I work at a Kroger and we had a hard time closing the store at 5 on Christmas Eve as planned. Lines a mile long. ER is gonna be epic numbers. This stock is way way undervalued.
"Hmm looks over sold since Identical sales without fuel at 1.8%, improved over last year. And the crooked analysts working for Shorts upgraded EPS 11 times to make sure it was a miss for their special interests in NY and NJ hedge funds that had puts in play. Rigged. But good buy for 30% increase from low now. Its food people, try doing without it. Dollar stores don't sell fresh foods. Chinese merchants are not competition for Kroger. When CEO finishes CC guidance is higher than expected for 2019..Buying more definitely and averaging down. Costco will be a beat later today."
I can’t understand this? KR beats expectations and the price goes down?
I’m telling you guidance or no guidance that stock was not helped by the horrible job done by the CEO on the earnings call. Yes obviously market manipulation with shorts winning but WOW never heard a CEO be more non-committal and even pessimistic about future earnings. Totally overshadowed the good news. Plus he spent more time talking about all the money KR is giving away both to social programs and employee benefits. Epic fail by the CEO. You hear the guy talk and can’t believe he is the CEO of such a large company.
"All in for Friday expiration, triple witching and shorts covering. Buffet has his price at 41 set. End of day rather own food, drug and gasoline than meme stock or bitcoin or a semi conductor bloated stock. Can't eat those things. Food is KING."
Did you pick up some under $23...??
"Simple truth brand is absolutely great. Low carbs, low sugar, healthy. Stores are clean and products are fresh as advertised. Walmart cluttered and definitely not clean or fresh. Employees are courteous and friendly. Gas points a bonus and digital download deals save lots of cash. Stock under toots control and this is where they want it regardless of retail wanting higher. least it doesn't collapse 8% a day like cyclical and growth stocks do."
private equity will be looking at this. easy money. Buffet is searching for undervalued companies.
"Funny old Buffet doesn't care about Kroger, he let Berkshire short it and watched the @#$% show. All just cash for the hogs of wall street."
Nice deal for Kroger with Tattooed Chef. Tattooed Chef was the best frozen food product start Target ever had. Amazing to see the numbers from Kroger!
let's finish off this week strong! not a bad start. bullish!
"three large block trade of more than 160,000 shares each, BEFORE 10:15. institutional buys."
Kroger in Berkshire Hathaways fund and due that will remain more stable as a key dividend safe play. KR has margin pressure on sales but the customer loyalty is high. Traditional generational shopping name. Barney Kroger to new family's is goodwill and thats immeasurable. KR strives to maintain quality guarantees and easy returns. Stock moving up from old base on analyst upgrades to right around here. it doesn't skyrocket or drop 10% like some other risky /dangerous stocks. Safe play. Steady as she goes. Every Kr in country has happy employees and satisfied customers.
"I sold too early, but not bad."
Hold KR at all cost....Thank me later...
"I see KR breaking through $35 after earnings ... if they can move up much farther after that has to be seen.P/E looks good, but debt is a bit on the high side ..."
Today the market is down and Kroger is up. The future looks bright and they are implementing so many new things that will drive sales and profits. Fourth-quarter should be great. Share price should be around $36. Happy weekend everybody.
"Hardly ever any good pricing, too many gimmicks to get a good price (two for one) digital coupon, I would like to know why Buffet thinks this stock will go up."
Buy the dips!
Just saw the article from the 9th mentioning a possible Buffett acquisition of Kroger. An interesting thesis given the state of our country right now and his love for “out of favor” businesses. When the EV and associated supply chain equities bubble pops we will see a flight to asset based companies with real earnings and products. Ideas are the foundation of US capitalism but not often in history have they been so successfully monetized without having been somewhat proven to work.
"Kroger now on sale! The head scratching drop has created a great buying opportunity. The technical indicators RSI, Slow Stochastic, Fast Stochastic & Ultimate Oscillator all are at or near oversold and 52 week lows. This downtrend should turn north by the end of the week. Companies that blow out earnings and substantially increase guidance don't generally go down. Two quarters in a row with blow out earnings and major stock price drops? The last quarter drop shortly recovered and didn't look back until earnings and I expect this one to do the same. We shall see."
whats going on with KR? no relevant news.. Supposed to be a consume staple & is a defensive play in a down mkt like today.. Even WMT & TGT are higher.. Broken the key support of 23.50 if it closes below that today..
BUYING Opportunity
Any thoughts on KR expanding the restaurant Kitchen 1883 concept?? Its getting great reviews from what I've seen. Could be a real money maker.
"Sold my KR shares at $31.00 for a loss of $5,845. Time to move on, and feeling happy that this loss is a LOT smaller than yesterday's GRPN Win. That is a VERY important statistic long-term: To be successful as a trader you need not just more winning plays than losing plays, but also for the winning plays to give you more profit, than the losing plays take away in loss... There is always a BRIGHT side to every situation, and mentally strong people always look for and embrace that bright side. Gonna try to move on to....a Short Sell of HOME. I just don't think I can resist her charms! Good Luck to All! :-)"
if you view KR on the 15 year chart it's nothing but up and hundreds of stable payouts. I love this stock. I've successfully day traded with 100 times without fail. Now i'm long.
i thought I'd have to wait to 2029 to retire...guess tomorrow instead! thx kroger Thx wall street
"When the market takes a big hit, KR goes up. When the market climbs, KR climbs. Nice stock but they should really consider adding more parking lots at their stores. It is always so crowded."

Back to 42 and pass that. No brainer with people buying up more stuff.
Bernstein analyst see Kroger merging with Walgreen in recent article explaining why they raised their outlook for Kroger and upped price per share outlook to $33!
Not sure what the big surprise is? Everybody knew they were spending money to better compete. Profits were expected to be lower and stock price already reflected it. Same store sales rose. Bit of an over-reaction here I’m buying more at open.
