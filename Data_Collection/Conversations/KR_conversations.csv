We're not going to see $35. And certainly not going lower than that. kr will bounce back up at this discount price.
CFRA - 34/share price target. Sell rating all day long.
38.90 is 200 moving average. :-)
"Sold Short a lot of shares of KR just before market close today at an average price of $46.16. Very happy with my fill price and feeling confident this will go down significantly tomorrow, in direct response to her earnings release. There is no value at the $46+ level, even if KR beats EPS and Revenue consensus estimates. This should be trading at the $41/share level based upon meeting both consensus estimates. Good Luck folks!"
Looks like Warren Buffet bought more.
"Funny old Buffet doesn't care about Kroger, he let Berkshire short it and watched the @#$% show. All just cash for the hogs of wall street."
"Reduce my position in KR in the closing today. I bought KR when Amazon bought Wholefood and continued to buy into each oversold weakness. With my luck, KR probably pops next week. If not, I will get back into it. Good luck to long."
Buy the dips!
"KR is ripping the benefits of the most advanced Robotic warehouse now after 3 years in building the AI powered advanced warehouse. Check on Utube of their state of the arts facilities. Ocado advanced robotic warehouse is pushing the Kroger online sales to recorded numbers. It is just the beginning of efficiency gain and margin expansion. I would buy as many KR shares as possible just as I did the same when the Empire Company EMP-A.TO launched the robotic warehouse with Ocada. The results are very positive. The sales and margins keep increasing. As many insiders are buying KR stocks, I would say KR is a great buy. KR will continuously improve the earnings, margin and growth. EMP-A is a classic grocery chain example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_psDSX-7P1s"
anyone here know why the big drop? It does not make sense to me - topline/bottom line all beat and guideline also boosted.
This is the exact scenario that Buffet looks for. No doubt BRK will be purchasing.
GOP laughing at Dems spendapalooza deals. Infra bill has no chance without the build back better agenda. And backstory it DOA from rich and famous Manchin wants to tax per online video yesterday. Bet on Corporations don't want it so likely that was reason Kr dropped expecting income tax increases from Dems bills. So Manchin holding the cards for conservatives and anti inflation. Hmm... Kr shorted beyond reason Friday. Down 9 in 6 weeks is pathetic collusion. Buffet can step in now and save face. Groceries are not coming from China like Walmart goods. Retail is different from Kroger warehouse and distribution from USA suppliers.
Since I need to abide by Yahoo's PC guidelines so I have nothing to say.
"The cycles of history. Speed of information. Speed of delivery. The pony express was the fastest machine of delivery from point A to B. Then speed of information, the telegraph. Planes. The internet. Back to speed of delivery. Amazon is building the infastructure. Do you actually think Kroger with their robotic distribution warehouses they are building out with all that time and investment and risk is being done just to shave a few tenths on a 1% margin game? Y'all cant see past the next rap video. WAKE UP. Kroger is branching out to the speed of delivery game within the amazon infastructure and theres nothing Amazon can do about it. Amazon and others will have to pay a premium for the roll out in those kroger territories. Kroger revenue anually will be at the TRILLION mark eventually when combining inflation trajectory at the coming velocity.The money doesnt exist, its just a numbers game now. Yep, 150 a share Kroger, the iPhone32 will be 5600$ but youll be able to fly your car by 7g wire plugged into your front gold grill diamond tooth mang'."
Looks like earnings are going to be monstrous!
A safe company.
this stock is going to pop within next few months.
Anyone who has 20-30 yrs experience and trades the supermarket where his wife works is doing something wrong…$KR
joke of a stock..kroger beats earnings on last call..drops 5$ #$%$..
I was up over 20% like a month ago what happened?
Just saw the article from the 9th mentioning a possible Buffett acquisition of Kroger. An interesting thesis given the state of our country right now and his love for “out of favor” businesses. When the EV and associated supply chain equities bubble pops we will see a flight to asset based companies with real earnings and products. Ideas are the foundation of US capitalism but not often in history have they been so successfully monetized without having been somewhat proven to work.
Good report. Why KR is down in pre-market?
"Krogers not going anywhere, they r the leading grocer in term of sales ahead of wallmart & all the rest by a mile.. Amazon has just entered with whole foods which is also going nowhere & will not be able to compete with Kroger in any case..This is a normal trading pattern by MM. and will spike to 25.50 at least which is a 180 support level within 2 weeks..This is a defensive stock & if index goes lower this is guaranteed to rise.. Hold on & average down."
dont get too excited20 billion in debt and razor thin margins 1%only 2 billion in cashthis stock barely cracks buffets top 25 holdings kroger can't raise prices above competition
"Hmm looks over sold since Identical sales without fuel at 1.8%, improved over last year. And the crooked analysts working for Shorts upgraded EPS 11 times to make sure it was a miss for their special interests in NY and NJ hedge funds that had puts in play. Rigged. But good buy for 30% increase from low now. Its food people, try doing without it. Dollar stores don't sell fresh foods. Chinese merchants are not competition for Kroger. When CEO finishes CC guidance is higher than expected for 2019..Buying more definitely and averaging down. Costco will be a beat later today."
"09:45 AM EDT, 06/18/2020 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We lift our 12-month target by $3 to $40, 14x our FY 20 EPS estimate and in line with KR's 10-year forward mean. We lift our FY 20 EPS estimate to $2.86 from $2.38 and FY 21's to $2.75 from $2.40. KR posts May-Q adjusted EPS of $1.22 vs. $0.72 (+69%), $0.08 above consensus. Identical sales (ex-fuel) spiked 19% (digital sales grew 92%), adjusted gross margin grew 44 bps and adjusted EBIT of $1.45B grew over 50%. KR pulled its previous FY 20 guidance due to Covid-19 uncertainties but expects to exceed its previous outlook. We maintain our Buy as an elevated level of food-at-home demand should continue through 2020 due to the pandemic and recession. KR's mix of low prices and use of rewards/promotions/coupons should fare well during a weak economy. Lastly, grocery e-commerce growth is poised to accelerate from the Covid-19 pandemic, in our view, and we believe KR's investments in e-commerce (KR's first highly automated customer fulfillment center is set to open in 2021) will help it gain market share."
Bought 80 shares lol…
Time for me to sell puts again and make money. Buy and hold is high risk for this stock.
We sure do live in strange times. Stocks like KR who have improved financials during the CV19 and have proven to do well during recessions are going down. All while stocks on the verge of bankruptcy are going up 9% or more. I guess it's a product of self investing. I would hate to be a financial advisor right now.

47.99 just short while ago. So someone wants to tank this on purpose. Either to buy more and take your money or just to go get better things. Pump is done? I will run. Made small profit and I am done with this daily bleed. Good God!
"Along with the known pluses Kr has like lousy restaurant experience Warren Buffet on and on add to this a large amount of forward purchasing, when inflation runs hard grocery companies like KR forward buy to make profit. They talk about this in the last quarterly report, I was in this business for 27 years and in the 70s when inflation was hot we packed the warehouses beyond capacity and made a lot of money doing it."
Bought back options on 24.5 bought another 200 down here and sold 8 25 calls for next week
"chaos in Dem's caucus over infrastructure and reconciliation spending spree bill on green new deal and day care for all. Market selloff guaranteed. 5 to 8% by Tuesday. Shake the weak hands off Kroger and let the bargain buys begin at 39.10. Dow up 500 pts and this stayed red/ Funny old buffet shorting for few million again. And Citron and Hindenberg. Consumer staples still the necessity of all the other sectors. Food, Drug, the best investment in down times. Fed ridiculous pretzel speech. Taper but leave saving interest at .05 % . Joke."
KR is way undervalued! KR low-bound is reached and it will go up trend tomorrow! It will be KR's turn to catch up the historical market index!
KR a monster now since Buffet owns 8%. 30.6 billion is the revenue to beat. Margins are tight since goods cost increased dramatically. May be miss on EPS and beat on revenue. Kr dominates Walmart in quality of food. Associates are happy at Kroger versus unhappy at Walmart. Late day selling to trick longs to sell. They already know if a beat or not. Buffet gets the call a week ago.
"OK, admittedly nothing makes sense in the market anymore. But a company with a single digit P/E, managable debt, a good dividend and a decent economic moat still has to be a decent buy, right?Right?Or is the new 'new' economy at full strength when only unicorns and banks are worth investing in?"
45 call for 9/17 Easy money
"No more than 9 cents in either direction in the last hour...Sure ain't like yesterday, last week, last month, last year, last decade. Must be option week."
Goldman downgrades KR on May 4 from 37/share to 31/share.....then purchases 1.7mm shares on June 30th @ 38/share. Why is that? Seems odd! What changed so drastically from May 4 to June 30 to persuade them to purchase so many shares above their price target?
Shorted 3900 shares here
How’s the KR ticker looking today? Just saying that there are so many great plays available right now. KR will always be there holding right around $30-40
The Kroger is up 4.90% to 45.58
Every dip in price of this one is a buy opportunity.
Too many people talking smack. I'm in to win! see you at the finish line. In it long!
"Few people mention the run up from $17 to $42 between Feb 2014 and Dec 2015 which also included a two for one split...so after figuring in the split by doubling today’s price the stock stands at roughly $44 a share today theoretically. Most people don’t realize the magnitude of this Kroger/Ocado marriage and the competitive edge that will give Kroger. When these new robotic facilities are completed and operation full swing, I for one can’t see how Amazon or Walmart will compare. The Amazon scare that drove down Kroger stock is completely blown out of proportion if you ask me. It has no merit. Fake news. Now is the time to buy Kroger. Don’t delay. It may not completely explode for another year or two but one thing is for sure, it’s coming. I’ve been long on Kroger for well over a decade. I continue to buy more of it every year and I ride it up in the good times or bad collections my dividends along the way. Since 1883 Kroger has thrived through every world war and the Great Depression too. They’ve always figured out a way to win and that’s why they are number one in the grocery game. Kroger most definitely owns the most properties in the most prime locations, locations that if Amazon had to purchase today they could never compete due to the massive overhead the cost of real estate would bring. Kroger will make me rich in the end, I’m sure of that and I’m patient, I’m not going away and neither is Kroger ;)"
Why the 3%+ drop today?
"Ignore the pundits and consider this instead: Per the latest 13F filings, Berkshire Hathaway is invested in just two retail companies, namely Amazon and Kroger. Not Target. Not WalMart. Not even Costco."
Wasn't expecting growth like this this year...but I'll take it.
Warren Buffet isn't going to be happy about this stock. Most of my I had stop losses on that sold already. Hope they raise prices to make a profit soon.
This stock should so be trading for $44 right now. Very bizarre.
"All in for Friday expiration, triple witching and shorts covering. Buffet has his price at 41 set. End of day rather own food, drug and gasoline than meme stock or bitcoin or a semi conductor bloated stock. Can't eat those things. Food is KING."
watch out 41 is the loony tune buffet strike price. Shorts American food and jobs for $$$$. Billionaires are all the same. Tax them to the maximum AOC and Sanders. Kroger is necessity and should be 50 a share on revenue and earnings beat last quarter. No way will it be though. Bait and hook set over 41 today. Triple witching day today.
Buffet is is Kroger. Watch prices of items in Kroger stores start to be priced higher. Buffet owned companies mark up prices on items.
They are preparing to buy Sprouts.
"KR prices are too high. The only time I shop there is when meat goes 50% off or twice a year when Progresso is priced at 99 cents so I can donate to the food bank. Otherwise Costco has everyone beat especially when they have markdowns each month on certain items like Clorox Wipes, Tide, Coffee, Cheese, Vitamins, etc."
If target is 34 means buy point is around 25-30?
i thought I'd have to wait to 2029 to retire...guess tomorrow instead! thx kroger Thx wall street
This stock is undervalued especially compared to the broader market.
10% pull back and counting

KR. Look at upside call options.Sure they might report higher costs but huuuige windfall in revenues from stay at home plus higher margin goods. A buyback or div hike may be unlikely given a the bonuses etc. KR hits $36-38 then I'm out unless there is a surprise. I thought it would be closer to $36-$37 by now so a break of $40-$42+ seems highly doubtful
Set to short 200 6 times set
"Old funny buffet shorting Kr ahead of ER this week. Miss is likely and margins slim on higher cost for goods. Labor wages are not keeping up with inflation. Consumer stock sell off this week ahead of weak employment data again. 48 was a total fluke on short covering. Kroger doesn't own any of its stores, merely a tenant to write off expenses of leases and shrink. Better merchandise than walmart though. Target over valued lemon stock. All will be corrected this month downward. thanks to libs in house."
Adding adding
This is going to 30’s today
"Looks like this afternoon will be good time to buy some shares of KR at a discount. If people read the report and didn't just look at a couple of numbers (the wrong numbers at that), they'd realize Kroger crushed it in Q2."
"KR --Kroger is down again this morning. I think some analyst have mis-understood about the investor 's day announcement. KR would have saved so much money on digitally. All digital coupons have been used andproven very effectively and cost savings. There no more paper coupons as they need to hire the backroomassociates to sort and mail to manufactures (MFG) for rebates. They can also tract all sales items by MFG get rebates fast from the MFG. In addition, the company's automated warehouse ""sheds"" provided by partner Ocado Group(OCDGF) will be as profitable as in-store models by their fourth year on an Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) basis.I expect KR stock price will come back to at least $37.50 by next week and KR is heading back to $42 near term. Take advantage of today's sell off and start accumulate more KR shares while collecting a nice dividend.. Warren Buffett has invested heavily into KR. ""Patience and Persistence are keys of winning""."
Surprised we are down this much today!
"Hopefully KR is finally going up , sold puts brought calls ..if ACI going up this should too"
"Worth $34 BB, doubt it, double Amer Airlines, which is international !!"
what a wonderful day. Hold on to your shares and enjoy the ride!
"good demand at higher prices. perhaps short covering. more to come. not a recommendation. people who paid up a month ago, now flushed out. ready to move higher."
Back to 28 in few months
Buying more shares today! Hope it will go to $45 soon!
what a joke that freak buffet is shorting Kroger. Associates will not buy in stock thats shorted by funny old senile billionaire at will.

"hello friends. i work for Publix and all i can say is you better be buying as much kroger stock as you can. at my store. shelves are getting filled and people are buying at-least 1-2 weeks worth of goods. this is great for all grocery retail stocks. it’s a win win. publix stock is at 48.90, is private and gets evaluated every quarter. kroger is a great buy for the next 2 quarters."
KR is still down from it’s all time highs just weeds ago. I love the stock but corruption is everywhere
"25% increase in food stamps. KR will soon be a $50 stock. My prediction by end of Sept. Inflation in transitory....Haha, yeah right. Here's to you Wells Fargo and Goldman grocery retail analysts for getting paid, and have no clue what you're doing."
"Only a matter of time before Amazon gets out of grocery business. I don’t even understand why they want to be in it. It’s super competitive, with high labor costs, low margins and what not.Kroger, on the other hand, needs to open more Fred Meyer stores all over the USA. Those are awesome, and Fred Meyer Club format could adopt Costco model, which is proven to be pure gold.This stock is a keeper, and this price is really funny."
Interesting to look at Walmart's yearly earnings vs. Kroger. Kroger: 121.16B and 3.11B in Earnings. Walmart: 514.41B and 6.67B in Earnings. This info is per the graphic that Yahoo puts on their page. Walmart sure has to generate a lot of sales to be a low price leader.
"Kroger (Fred Myers store) did it again when I went to place an online order. When you try to buy an order from weekly sales add, you can not add it to your cart. I called the store, and they said to call, and they would add it after the order was placed. Just cancelled the order and ordered from Albert sons with no problem. I think it is time to sell my Kroger stock."
Buffet has loaded up with more KR
This 80 Year old stock owner loves Kroger! Home delivery is great community support is great and parking lot is full all the time. stock has done well and in my opinion will continue to go up gradually and they will make Money and pay dividends. What more could you ask for in a Company? Bought and holding why sell.
I am staying far away from KR - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
right on the dot for Berkshire Hathaway short fund. 41$ No reason to worry it will rise soon. All elective surgery has been cancelled on the East Coast. Covid variant is much worse than being told. FDA turns down booster shot on political lines. Get the shot if you can if your elderly. Next 3 months shutdowns will be occuring in schools and businesses. Travel limited as well. The markets are phony. Billionaires running the prices to what ever they profit on. Tax tax and more tax on elites.
what's the true price point of this stock?
KR broke above 2015 highs. Blue skies ahead.
Not a shareholder but we shop at a pic n save. I know they have done market research but what is a reason they don’t make all stores Kroger?
sell sell
"Huge beat on revenue and earnings. Just the crooks shaking out weak hands. The analyst know KR has huge cash reserve, raised guidance. And the conference call was excellent. The back story is Buffet owning over 8% as the oracle from omaha knows a good stock. Regardless of the manipulation of short toots. Kroger can abd will make a fortune on stay at home eating habits due covid. Kroger far exceeds quality in their private selection brands. Marketing is great. Digital coupons and click pick doing terrific. This company is a buy at 42 for sure. Hold for 50 this year. Average associate make 21$ an hour with benefits added to salary. They are happy and customers are happy. Go Krogering today and buy Stock on sale."
HF still shorting KR. Exactly why I got out and went all in on A M C.
"""Sense .... This drop makes none"""
"I sure like this company and like their local company, Smith's Food & Drug...very well run chain. Love the fact that Kroger is not egotistical and they seem to buy good companies and let the mgt team keep running them...the only thing that concerns me right now is this head & shoulders pattern, does this mean we are going back into a year of being wall street's most hated stock?"
I will be in at 35.
Bought 400 shares at $42.00. I like bargains
No reason for drop
Doubled my position at the close today at $41.10. Now 1500 shares with a $43.22 average
Picked up 400 shares sold the 24.5 call for next week
"This stock price has fluctuated quite a bit considering it is a big grocer. I see the attractiveness in that the business has some basic stability in good times and bad; I see the basis for some relief associated with the reports on AMZN/WFM reducing their emphasis on low prices (allowing KR to raise prices slightly anyway). Seems that rise was overdone, and now a 5% drop (in KR, for goodness sake) as a correction? Or is there other news I am missing. On another note, it seems the online ordering/pickup/delivery is good and all, but that there will be a small minority of people using these services. So it's not like they need to change their business model overnight -- i.e., there's no crisis as long as they're focusing on good customer service, etc.I would love for the decline to continue for a bit more to be able to add less expensive shares for the long term -- KR seems like good ballast for a portfolio over the long term!"
"citadel shorting this on every buy. funny man Buffet needs to step up. Oh yea he's shorting to. Dementia though he can't remember just chuckles. Kr margins shrinking but eating at home a necessity with Delta pandemic. Mask orders in Ohio, Pa and WV yesterday. School closings are coming next. 41.50 is too cheap. 2600 great stores with over 450K associates. Administration vaccine program by KR great benefit for public in communities. Loyal to brand of KR. value and quality."
Back up to 40's to stay there. Recession is here.
the ceo needs to be more aggressive buying back the stock.
So slow. Goes down fast 2-3-5-10 dollars and for small change of 50 cents to a dollar is taking a day.
"Another 52 week high, and another good day. Keep on Krogering!"
Get your COVID-19 booster at Kroger! I did!
"I felt the market already wanted this one to go down on earnings anyway. It's had a pretty good run over the last 3 months, and they felt we were ahead of our skis. But I thought earnings were good, they are great place to pass on inflationary costs, so safe moving forward too. I ended up buying 1/3 more, you don't tend to get irrational negativity on good stocks too often, so a good buying opportunity."
Another beat long and strong
$1200 stimulus money all going to food. Wmt KR AMZN
"@KR has been sold off 4 straight days after earnings released on Friday 9-10-2021. It was so oversoldand currently @KR is sitting in the oversold area. It is a defensive stock in any bad markets. @KR is an overlooked stock and it is due for a rebounding soon. If it closes at $42.25 at the close today, then it will rise to $43 near term."
"I am going to be selling short a lot of shares of KR before market close today. as a Pure Earnings play. This stock is clearly and obviously over-valued and should sell off significantly tomorrow, Friday, in direct response to a weak/disappointing earnings release. Depending upon how bad the release is, a 5-10% share price drop seems likely to me."
I recently sold all Kroger stock over 40. I bought it in the low 20 range thinking it was worth 30. it's still worth 30.
drop another 20% for an over reaction response and I will load the boat....
WOKE BLM. Not interested. Writing CC OP @ $42 with $25 cost. I’ve held KR for many years. Moving on.
"The consumer staples food stocks are mostly up nicely today except KR stock.The news showed one insider exercised her stock option yesterday and her exercised stock option price of KR was at 24 and she sold during market sold off at 42.04, (bought and sold the same time) and pocketed a nice gain. She still holds approx. 120.000 shares of KR in her portfolio . This insider's trading news caused KR sell-off today.The sell-off is overdone and it should rebound soon..."
It’s amazing that one man Warren Buffet can make the stock move so much.
"Ok, I’ve started reestablishing a long position in KR."
Anyone else concerned about the rising current liabilities?
"""they"" toots shorting and holding ""buffet"" want this at 42.00 and they can put it right there. Down 6 off recent high. Stalling/ shrinking margins the excuse for short selling. market on consumer staples lower on Walmart. But Target and Costco up. Buffet funny old short seller. Rodney on CNBC earlier didn't help. Discussing Kroger and Instacart are teaming up for a partnership called ‘Kroger Delivery Now’ .. Always Kroger is a safety play not phony cyber junk, risky bartering toy bitcoin. But millenials are dictating the market. Food irrelevant. NOT. Kroger should be up 2 bucks IMO."
"I wish they could sell more of this stock, so I would buy more"
Buffett bought a lot or two.
Looks like taking profits on this one a few weeks ago was a mistake! :)
"KR is my biggest holding and WAS up 28% YTD. It tends to move up on bad days for the market and in days like this, goes down in a good market. With a dividend yield of about 2% and a PE near 14, it is a safe and productive holding that will hold up when the market (overpriced), finally corrects. For those looking for a sound, safe and long term rewarding position, you could do far worse than KR."
Guess it’s time to sell now and then buy back cheaper.
Why is my defensive stock acting like a silicon valley growth stock? I don't see any news.
Why the Drop ? Does someone know something ahead of tomorrow ?
someone bought 33k shares AH...Definitely going big on the dip
"Warren Buffett holds almost 62 millions shares of KR ( 1 of the top 3) of KR stocks...Rumors he just addedmore shares of KR recently....In the volatile markets, consumer staples is where the money managers willbuy and the KR is the greatest defensive stock, liquid with a nice dividend...."
BUYING Opportunity
"Fun facts. 43 million shares were repurchased in FY 2020 (804M to 761M). There were 253 days the market was open or 169,960 shares disappeared each trading day in 2020 on average. 43m shares X .72 annual dividend = 31 million annual payment savings (about 4 cents a share a year) going forward in 2021+ and counting. Sometimes a lower price is not a bad thing long term. I went through this with TGT 4 years ago. It tanked to under 50 with a PE under 10 and was getting no love from Wallstreet so I got in around 48. Its stock repurchase just got ever more effective with the lower price and its Div and operating expenses were easily covered like KR. With dividends TGT has been a 4 bagger over the last 4 years. The coil spring on KR looks similarly tight. I am (seriously) fine if the price stays under 35 for a few more qtrs. Ill reinvest the Divs for extra cheap shares and let KR knock out more every day than I could hope to buy."
At one point I held over 500 shares of KR. Held for about 10 years and made a very modest return. I then took all of my cash and invested into AMC 9 months ago and I have over 300% gains right now. AMC by far has been the best investment I’ve ever made. I still like the KR stock and might invest in it again but wanted to share with you my experience. And yes I’m still holding every single AMC share that I own 
"Have you been shopping at KR lately? Their grocery prices are much higher than few months ago. Also, they are just partnered with the Instacart @ delivery service company as announced last week to boost their revenue sales across all KR's supermarket stores in the US. You all will see the revenue and gross margin will be much increased in the next earnings release. Be patient !!!!!"
"Blood in the street.......for no good reason. Sound management and definitely going in the right direction. To those of us who have seen this before, let us thank them for the opportunity. The best to all."
KR is being shorted again around $45. MM will never let this stock rip. Should’ve been over $100 easily by now with all the COVID shopping. This is exactly why I sold for the short term and went after the HF and MM and invested all in onAMC. There is only one way to win the war of corruption in the stock exchange. We need to fight them head on! I wish all of you the best of luck with your investments. 
@KR: Waiting for the Booster shot to be authorized and announced by the White House and followed by KR's news because KR has pharmacy in each supermarket it owns that would provide the vaccination services. Their Covid 19 vaccination services that they contracted with the government in early 2021 wouldprovide them much bigger revenue and very profitable. I got an email from my health insurance that any patient that needs a booster shot will be covered when needed that authorized by their primary doctor.Not sure why KR stock has been selling off 4 straight days why all consumer staples food stocks are mostly green today due to market rally. What is happening to KR stock... It is so oversold in the last 4 days... and overdue for rebounding soon.
been buying puts the whole way up with dates past earnings. this thing will fall back to earth when it reports inflation cutting into their razor thin margins...
"KR---Analysts missed out about KR with 2000 pharmacies with the recent news that KR now working with 37 states and federal level to distribute and manage Covid 19 vaccines at its pharmacies.... The is a HUGH NEWS for KR...This translates into bigger REVENUE and bigger PROFITS, bigger EPS....KR is heading back to $37 by YE2020."
ALL SUPERMARKETS AND FOOD STOCKS are up 3 days in a row except KR as it has been down 6 straight days and currently KR is sitting in oversold area for many days.ACI: +1.3UNFI: .65PFGC: 1.32SFM: .40SPTN: .19SYY: 1.89USFD: .49KHC: .43The entire markets have been green for the past 3 days and lift all sectors including the defensive sectorslike consumer staples food stocks...... Not sure what has happened to KR. Any one knows??? Even analysts upgraded KR to much higher price than currently 40.09 but it did not seem to move the stockprice....
Berkshire increased their stake by 20% in the second quarter.
"Just wondering if other investors feel there is any long term motivation to hold onto this stock. I'm down 28% since purchase. It seems to continually drop, even in up markets. It's down to where it was in May of last year, with an 18% drop in 11 days."
I suspect that Kroger gets a much better margin with Private Selection ice cream and they don't meed another ice cream manufacturing facility. Turkey Hill is just another brand to the customer. The strategy is to more and more store brands which are as good or better than national brands and lower in price.
"A few things not in the headlines on yet another solid but boring quarter (just how I like my stocks). Net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.79 vs 1.81. Not a huge change but going in the right direction and was already good to start with. Average number of common shares used in Diluted calculation 752m vs 780m. Thats KR retiring 110,671 shares every trading day the market was open on average last year (28m / 253 days). New $1 billion buyback approved replacing the one that ended last week. Excluding fuel, sales decreased 4.0% compared to the same period last year. Not nearly as bad as the doom and gloom shorts were talking about post covid. With the guidance this could very well get into the 40 this quarter IMO."
35.69 is the next support level down. Watch and learn how it hits and bounces off this level.
KR annual dividend this year 72 cents with double-digit component growth! That is so impressive with certain reward under this economy. That's why most analysts raised the target including Goldman Schs for its business. KR should be at $35 now. Both technical view and valuation warrant the price!!!

Here in Michigan I have a relative who works at Kroger told me that sales were up 55% in the first week of this crisis. Shoppers aren’t concerned about price so much as getting the product. That means margin levels will be high and profit should be way higher. How is the stock trading about the same as before this crisis? It makes no sense to me! I’m going long for now! Please counter my optimism about Kroger based on what I may not know. I am new to Kroger stock.
"I sold too early, but not bad."
