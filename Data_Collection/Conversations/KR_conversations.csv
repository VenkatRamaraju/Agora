"Along with the known pluses Kr has like lousy restaurant experience Warren Buffet on and on add to this a large amount of forward purchasing, when inflation runs hard grocery companies like KR forward buy to make profit. They talk about this in the last quarterly report, I was in this business for 27 years and in the 70s when inflation was hot we packed the warehouses beyond capacity and made a lot of money doing it."
Sold 8 40 calls
"Kroger Ohio valley Zone stores just now ratified new contract and accepted great pay increases, continued premier health insurance benefits on 55% to 45% margin vote. Competitive wages for Kroger. Margins going to improve. Sector from Walmart, Target, whole foods/amazon affecting KR. Buffet owning 9% will always backstop his holdings. Shorts covering before EOD. Infrastructure deal coming any minute, hour will catalyst the shorts out. Associates at Kroger are working well with management and the shopping environment is clean, friendly and rewarding to saving $."
the ceo needs to be more aggressive buying back the stock.
This stock should so be trading for $44 right now. Very bizarre.
"Have you been shopping at KR lately? Their grocery prices are much higher than few months ago. Also, they are just partnered with the Instacart @ delivery service company as announced last week to boost their revenue sales across all KR's supermarket stores in the US. You all will see the revenue and gross margin will be much increased in the next earnings release. Be patient !!!!!"
Doubled my position at the close today at $41.10. Now 1500 shares with a $43.22 average
How’s the KR ticker looking today? Just saying that there are so many great plays available right now. KR will always be there holding right around $30-40
"citadel shorting this on every buy. funny man Buffet needs to step up. Oh yea he's shorting to. Dementia though he can't remember just chuckles. Kr margins shrinking but eating at home a necessity with Delta pandemic. Mask orders in Ohio, Pa and WV yesterday. School closings are coming next. 41.50 is too cheap. 2600 great stores with over 450K associates. Administration vaccine program by KR great benefit for public in communities. Loyal to brand of KR. value and quality."
"good demand at higher prices. perhaps short covering. more to come. not a recommendation. people who paid up a month ago, now flushed out. ready to move higher."
"Hopefully KR is finally going up , sold puts brought calls ..if ACI going up this should too"
this stock is going to pop within next few months.
Shorted 3900 shares here
Yes! Back to $40. Bullish
Don’t think it sees 40 today let alone 40.15
38.90 is 200 moving average. :-)
Good report. Why KR is down in pre-market?
Time for me to sell puts again and make money. Buy and hold is high risk for this stock.
At one point I held over 500 shares of KR. Held for about 10 years and made a very modest return. I then took all of my cash and invested into AMC 9 months ago and I have over 300% gains right now. AMC by far has been the best investment I’ve ever made. I still like the KR stock and might invest in it again but wanted to share with you my experience. And yes I’m still holding every single AMC share that I own 
"Sold Short a lot of shares of KR just before market close today at an average price of $46.16. Very happy with my fill price and feeling confident this will go down significantly tomorrow, in direct response to her earnings release. There is no value at the $46+ level, even if KR beats EPS and Revenue consensus estimates. This should be trading at the $41/share level based upon meeting both consensus estimates. Good Luck folks!"
"Warren Buffett holds almost 62 millions shares of KR ( 1 of the top 3) of KR stocks...Rumors he just addedmore shares of KR recently....In the volatile markets, consumer staples is where the money managers willbuy and the KR is the greatest defensive stock, liquid with a nice dividend...."
@KR: Waiting for the Booster shot to be authorized and announced by the White House and followed by KR's news because KR has pharmacy in each supermarket it owns that would provide the vaccination services. Their Covid 19 vaccination services that they contracted with the government in early 2021 wouldprovide them much bigger revenue and very profitable. I got an email from my health insurance that any patient that needs a booster shot will be covered when needed that authorized by their primary doctor.Not sure why KR stock has been selling off 4 straight days why all consumer staples food stocks are mostly green today due to market rally. What is happening to KR stock... It is so oversold in the last 4 days... and overdue for rebounding soon.
KR rank #1 Zacks strong buy
GOP laughing at Dems spendapalooza deals. Infra bill has no chance without the build back better agenda. And backstory it DOA from rich and famous Manchin wants to tax per online video yesterday. Bet on Corporations don't want it so likely that was reason Kr dropped expecting income tax increases from Dems bills. So Manchin holding the cards for conservatives and anti inflation. Hmm... Kr shorted beyond reason Friday. Down 9 in 6 weeks is pathetic collusion. Buffet can step in now and save face. Groceries are not coming from China like Walmart goods. Retail is different from Kroger warehouse and distribution from USA suppliers.
They are preparing to buy Sprouts.
CFRA - 34/share price target. Sell rating all day long.
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Multistockalerts.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
"KR is my biggest holding and WAS up 28% YTD. It tends to move up on bad days for the market and in days like this, goes down in a good market. With a dividend yield of about 2% and a PE near 14, it is a safe and productive holding that will hold up when the market (overpriced), finally corrects. For those looking for a sound, safe and long term rewarding position, you could do far worse than KR."
"The consumer staples food stocks are mostly up nicely today except KR stock.The news showed one insider exercised her stock option yesterday and her exercised stock option price of KR was at 24 and she sold during market sold off at 42.04, (bought and sold the same time) and pocketed a nice gain. She still holds approx. 120.000 shares of KR in her portfolio . This insider's trading news caused KR sell-off today.The sell-off is overdone and it should rebound soon..."
ALL SUPERMARKETS AND FOOD STOCKS are up 3 days in a row except KR as it has been down 6 straight days and currently KR is sitting in oversold area for many days.ACI: +1.3UNFI: .65PFGC: 1.32SFM: .40SPTN: .19SYY: 1.89USFD: .49KHC: .43The entire markets have been green for the past 3 days and lift all sectors including the defensive sectorslike consumer staples food stocks...... Not sure what has happened to KR. Any one knows??? Even analysts upgraded KR to much higher price than currently 40.09 but it did not seem to move the stockprice....

Warren Buffet isn't going to be happy about this stock. Most of my I had stop losses on that sold already. Hope they raise prices to make a profit soon.
"@KR has been sold off 4 straight days after earnings released on Friday 9-10-2021. It was so oversoldand currently @KR is sitting in the oversold area. It is a defensive stock in any bad markets. @KR is an overlooked stock and it is due for a rebounding soon. If it closes at $42.25 at the close today, then it will rise to $43 near term."
Every dip in price of this one is a buy opportunity.
Get your COVID-19 booster at Kroger! I did!
Back up to 40's to stay there. Recession is here.
"I sure like this company and like their local company, Smith's Food & Drug...very well run chain. Love the fact that Kroger is not egotistical and they seem to buy good companies and let the mgt team keep running them...the only thing that concerns me right now is this head & shoulders pattern, does this mean we are going back into a year of being wall street's most hated stock?"
Set to short 200 6 times set
"I am going to be selling short a lot of shares of KR before market close today. as a Pure Earnings play. This stock is clearly and obviously over-valued and should sell off significantly tomorrow, Friday, in direct response to a weak/disappointing earnings release. Depending upon how bad the release is, a 5-10% share price drop seems likely to me."
WOKE BLM. Not interested. Writing CC OP @ $42 with $25 cost. I’ve held KR for many years. Moving on.
