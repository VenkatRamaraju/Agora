"We are pleased to share the full 24-week results from our pivotal Phase 3 TRuE-V program for the first time with the global dermatology community at EADV, which resulted in significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation in vitiligo patients treated with ruxolitinib cream,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation & Autoimmunity, Incyte. ""These positive results reinforce the potential for ruxolitinib cream as a meaningful treatment option for people suffering from vitiligo, and we look forward to working with regulators to bring the first approved medical treatment that directly addresses repigmentation to patients in the U.S. and Europe."""
"Tom, you're what we call a prolific poster ... aka SPAMMER"
"Lilly seems proud of the alopecia areata results they're presenting at EADV. While the lede is effectiveness of 4 mg baricitinib daily, they said at the Cantor healthcare conference that they intend to go with a 2 mg dose in the US. The bit from their pr of greatest interest to Incyte investors is probably ""- Safety data in AA showed no new safety signals for OLUMIANT up to 36 weeks of treatment in the longest Phase 3, placebo-controlled period for the JAK inhibitor class to date -""Ordinarily this sort of safety result would turn FDA's class-of-drug warning into a punchline, but FDA is...special. In any event, a meeting presentation won't have the level of detail appropriate for a full paper. And of course, label repair wasn't a pre-specified endpoint."

Jacosa: Another approval and we can't we can't even recover yesterdays loss?Incyte Announces the Validation of the European Marketing Authorization Application for Ruxolitinib Cream in Vitiligo
"One possibility for this morning's 10 AM INCY air pocket is dissemination of the information that British regulators have granted a status analogous to the US Fast Track program to imetelstat. Well, that might be good for Geron, but it remains very far from having a material effect on Incyte business. In the absolutely-most-Geron-favorable case, imetelstat might be approved for refractory anemia in a bit over a year. In the British syatem, approvals are more specific than in the US system--the drug would not be available for prescribing for non-MDS indications, nor at doses higher than used against refractory anemia. There remains absolutely no possibility that imetelstat could be approved for prescribing to anyone who might alternatively be prescribed Jakafi any time before 2025.There is at least one Incyte pipeline candidate that might compete in the MDS space--the ALK2 one. Its principal suggested indication is other than MDS."
"The Liar is Lying more than ever, more incoherent than ever, and seriously confused about reality even wheb he tries to tell the truth. He has never guestimated correct numbers (no shame in that, but plenty of shame in claiming any accuracy).I have no idea why he talks about baricitinib cream, because no such thing exists. As for me never using sec.gov, as recently as day before yesterday I used it for extra color on possible milestones owed to CALA. [Incidentally, my upper bound of $40MM is just that, an upper bound. The lower bound is a single dollar and my best guess is a bit under $10MM. Participation income on Monjuvi is the difference between 2 uncertain numbers, so I'd assign a possible range of something between a $10MM loss and, say, an $8MM credit. with a tilt to the better numbers. Pemazyre grew to Q2 by 33% QoQ and 300% YoY--there was talk of new tumor histologies with high rates of sensitive mutations. Another good place to not make a call. We simply lack information on Baricitinib royalty rates in non-RA indications (where Incyte did not participate in development. Since historical xUS royalties were all-RA-derived and this Q's gains are mostly non-RA (and while EU gains are mixed, the RA portion can be estimated pretty well), we'll have a lot more information in future [I don't expect alopecia areata to be that big, but SLE could be.My reality-based hope for 91 cents a share comes from >12% Jakafi growth, $25 MM from Pemazyre, break-even in Monjuvi and nothing material elsewhere."
"No secret: the biggest unguessable number in Q3 results is Monjuvi sales. Googling for hints, I found a nice from-the-field review of treatments for R/R DLBCL. https://www.targetedonc.com/view/matasar-considers-treatment-options-in-b-cell-lymphomaFirst point is that there's about 5 times as much as I thought. Apparently, twenty percent or so of patients treated with R-CHOP respond well to the first cycle or 2, but then stop responding. Next point is that most treatment of R/R cases, and especially these early loss-of-response patients, is with regimens not specifically approved by FDA for the purpose. Reluctance to use tafasitamab-based regimens is largely because most of the ""sexy"" treatment approaches [CAR-T; antibody-drug conjugates] share the CD-19 target with tafa. The thought is that after one treatment targeting CD-19 is used up, the others won't work. Safety / tolerability of Monjuvi is better than any of the other second-line contenders. Efficacy, especially for ling-term survival, is at least as good as anything demonstrated, but, and this is the key, not as good as what is hoped for. Confusing the, situation there has been at least one trial (not cited in this paper, and I didn't take notes when I stumbled across it weeks ago) in which a CAR-T treatment retained effectiveness after a different treatment targeted at the same antigen had failed."
"In a report released today, Reni Benjamin from JMP Securities reiterated a Buy rating on Incyte, with a price target of $124.00. The companyâ€™s shares closed last Thursday at $69.78, close to its 52-week low of $69.42."
"Suppose, just suppose, that someone single-mindedly wanted to damage Incyte. Suppose that person was well-known to analysts, and consequently ignored, but suppose that person had formerly been in the securities industry and kept up an address book of desk traders (takes some effort because there's a lot of turnover). Suppose such a person sent a dozen or two emails slamming Incyte to every desk trader (or just to the new-ish ones) every day. You might get a situation in which analysts generally liked Incyte, and regarded good news as good news, and bad news as bad news, but in which the share price dropped on bad news and didn't rise on good news. How likely does this seem?"
When INCY received 2 FDA approvals the stock price tumbled. Today they have been kind of slightly downgraded by a major bank ... maybe the stock price might go up today. Just wishful thinking here because INCY defies logic imo.

"It appears that The Liar is losing his eyesight. That ""well hidden"" withdrawal of the EU application showed up in a Yahoo! story when it happened. I posted, but it got eaten because I had silently gotten logged out out. I didn't consider it interesting enough to re-post, because EMA is MUCH more negative on applications lacking a simultaneous control group than FDA is, so after FDA objected to use of historical controls, EU approval became implausible. There is a lot of politics around the US BLA application covering SCAC; in effect, Incyte got definitive consideration 12-18 months earlier than they otherwise could in return for expenses of submitting the [extreme long shot] application (the clinical trial had already been run) and embarrassment.The numbers he claims to make bold estimates of were published an hour before yesterday's CC where they always are, on the Olumiant page (34) of the earnings presentation. Actual Q3 numbers for Olumiant in Q3 were $194MM in US and $407MM worldwide. This is even harder than you might first think to interpret because the EUA permits administration of 4 mg a day of Olumiant, which is outside the permanent label."
"Concerning fair value for INCY: here's the key sentence from the BoA/ML report 2 weeks back.""Our PO of $102 for INCY consists of $55/sh for Jakafi/Jakavi, $21/sh for Ruxolitinib cream, $3/sh for Pemazyre, <$1/sh for Monjuvi, $4/sh for Olumiant royalty, $1/sh for Iclusig, $1/sh for Tabrecta royalty, $7/sh for pipeline, and the remainder in net cash. "" A lot of valuation depends on rates of change: the last couple of Qs Incyte has beaten ML estimates. Tabrecta had a remarkably good introduction, but it's too soon to guess about follow-through. There seems to be a good case that the ML estimate is NOT rich. ""traditional"" Jakafi ought to be unharmed by the cl#$%$ warning (everything was already on the label, and both MF and aGvHD treatments are uniquely life-saving. Growth in PV has been in a free and informed market). Estimates of the cream business have been made #$%$uming a warning for at least the last year; the actual safety reads have been cleaner than expected. Pemazyre has been getting awfully enthusiastic press, partly because new tumor subtypes with elevated rates of FGFR rearrangements have been recognized. Ms Ahmad is [essentially] silent about M[io]njuvi; #$%$ inflated hopes for various ""miraculous"" immunotherapies fade, tafasitamab ought to become more valuable. ML also takes the cautious approach of hiding LIMBER prospects. It isn't WILDLY optimistic to expect a 25% addition to Jaka[fv]i from Limber.In the time-honored manner of all securities analysts, forecasts are getting changed to fit recent price action"
"nvax hammered yesterday on production delays yet again, shares starting recovery already, incyte gets 2 fda approvals and goes down and stay down 2.5 billion in market cap"
Wouldn't Jacosa be a buyer of INCY rather than a seller? Why is Jacosa selling and yet posting hey blue skies aere on the horizon? A wolf in sheep's clothing?
Incyte should sell its European business which brings nothing but having huge spending. The question is who will buy it!!!
"I've been trying to come up with ANYTHING better than a ""dunno"" for a M[io]njuvi prediction. The key problem is that sales data has historically come from The US where costs and revenues are shared more-or-less equally between Incyte snd MorphoSys, but reporting is the responsibility of MorphoSys, which has been a German company, generally providing less color than is customary for US companies. Famously, Berkshire Hathaway is also grudging with non-mandatory disclosures (and generates surprises that annoy analysts.). The joint Monjuvi business has never seen a ""normal"" quarter until [probably] this one. In the Q1 CC, Incyte management forecasted that the Monjuvi business would normalize in this Q and in the Q2 CC there was a comment that the business was tending toward normal (although oncologists were still difficult to reach for sales visits). There are also some DBBCL-specific developments that favor Monjuvi sales: the CME presentations I've seen suggest a population eligible for second-line treatment of about 17,000 vs an earlier estimate of about 10,000, and there are now 2 lines of evidence suggesting that prior trearment with Monjuvi will not preclude later treatment with CAR-T cells. But for all that, I remain skeptical. I'd call ""normal' for this stage of the introduction something in the $10-20MM earnings range, but I'll be delighted to hit the bottom of that, and satisfied just getting out of the red. It'll be another week until MorphoSys reports for themselves.Minjuvi is entirely Incyte's business. I don't expect the UK introduction to have been pushed ahead of long-planned Germany, so impact this Q ought to be positive, but small. the Q 4 report ought to pretty nice. [because of N.I.C.E., of course]"
"One lesson I learned as a chemist is that you don't just need to get an explanation when things go wrong, you want an explanation when things go right, too. So I reviewed the report of the Q4 2020 CC. There were, of course, no out-of-line financials. It isn't made clear in the discussion, but there appears to have been some stocking of Jakafi--common in Q4. Spending behind the Monjuvi launch was substantial, about what would be expected. Because Monjuvi sales are by MorphoSys, and weren't expected to amount to much in Q4, the developing problem there didn't stand out. Nothing, in general, to suggest a large non-repeatable, contributor to the big Q3 to Q4 gain."
"now abbv, hits it out of the park with earnings, and has recovered half of the losses it incurred when the fda, slammed them and others, not incyte 's ruxo for MF and PV, with new labelling for JAK inhibitors, we shall see if incyte can do the same feat.

"I've been trying to figure out why Q3 '20 was SO bad. It was before Covid messed business up too badly. The PR after the CC said: ""Operating income (loss) GAAP and Non-GAAP operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 decreased compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to $120 million of expense related to the purchase of the FDA priority review voucher and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements. "" We can argue about the PRV at length (I think it was a necessary gamble that failed); the main point, though, is that it was a modest share of the increase in R&D expense. What it looks like is that Incyte voluntarily made ""a bad quarter"" by triggering several monoclonal antibody milestones together. Strategic bad quarters appear to be a particular favorite of Christiana's (expensing the MorphoSys deal with several milestones pre-paid was a very large strategic bad quarter). Anyway, that feeds into the stated corporate intention to keep the R&D line decreasing relative to revenue for the near future. Without intentional early triggering of milestones this year, there shouldn't be a high-R&D surprise. Of course there COULD be stealthy lcinical trial programs, but It'll be MANY years before the board forgets rux-for-solid-tumors.If the Monjuvi rollout hadn't been so spectacularly bad, the full F'20 year would probably still have been profitable. That's part of why I consider this Q's Monjuvi result particularly important."
"management is so incredible, no matter how low the price goes, it will not buyback any shares, look for an upcoming announcement of yet another huge deal to take the price lower, guessing it is with agen as management has been selling shares in the last year"
Saw my first incy tv commercial this weekend. Not an investor in this stock but it sure looks like a troubled company. Geron will take over the mds market what esle ya got?
"Come the CC, it's going to be interesting to see how last year's lousy quarter affects reactions. The Zacks-s of the world will automatically lead with the impressive YoY comparison. Slightly classier outfits will try to make corrections for relative impact of disastrous weather in the 2 years. There'll be attempts in some quarters at pandemic corrections The big wirehouses are in a position to break the numbers down by week and by city, but they may not bother."
"the list, fire herve, cfo, and ir, replace compensation committee on the bod, replace j Baker, bod, step testing epacadostat, itacitinib, sell monjuvi, have a buyback program if 2 billion"
"Actually, what I'm saying is AT LEAST a 25% beat of the ""consensus"" 73 cents. Thst's whay, 6 cents above Zack's? But Zack's doesn't have a number for Olumiant royalty. They don't guess at Pamazyre growth (which was 33% from Q1 to Q2.) They appear to leave earnings loss to Monjuvi unchanged. Looks to me like they want to be sure nobody accuses them of having sparkles in their eyes."
"9th on the leader board just like that, only other bio tech on list is biib"
"Funny thing, The Liar just brought up rux cream. Let's ignore my former or present opinion, because there's actual news, and it has some interest. The EMA has validated the MAA for rux cream in vitiligo. This action is analogous to accceptance of an NDA in the US, but a few months further along the process. Incyte previously announced an intention to pursue US licensing before EU licensing, so either that plan has changed, or the US NDA has been filed but not accepted yet (Incyte rather publicly adopted a policy around the AD NDA that they don't consider filings with the FDA material events that MUST be disclosed promptly; only FDA responses are material). For legalistic reasons, EU pricing of rux cream dictates that it must be approved for vitiligo before the MAA for atopic dermatitis is sought. Given FDA's deadly hostility to JAK inhibitors, very delayed US approval can be anticipated. [while the cream used for V is the same as that used for AD, the dosing is 3-4 times as aggressive). Normally, sell-in is more gradual in Europe than in the US, but scorched-earth opposition from FDA in the face of ABSOLUTELY CLEAN AD trial results and clean V trial results (a little more has been published about the AD results; there's no dirt apparent in V results; we just know less) makes the 2 markets look about equally ""fertile"" for sell-in, and may well require higher selling expense in US."
"I did another CME unit relating to DLBCL on ""MedPage Today"" The opportunity for M[io]njuvi looks better than ever. While the incidence estimate is lower, the 2-year R/R is again estimated over 20%. The faculty passed over the need for cytotoxic chemo in other second-line treatments, but patient comments were pretty negative. The latest CAR-T treatments are catching up to M[io]njuvi in duration of response, but that is accomplished by adding target antigens other than CD-19, which opens the possibility of using combos."
"Analyst question in the Lilly CC about the impact of the new class-of-drug warning on the baricitinib business: Olumiant will remain later-line than biologics in RA treatment, and will, as expected, debut as later line than biologics for AD. In other words, no effect"
"Sales of Jakavi and Olumiant both grew at an accelerating rate QoQ. It is tricky to pull out European use of Olumiant to treat Cobid, but at the lowest run-rate I can imagine, use of Olumiant against RA has surpassed a $1 bln / yr run rate. US Olumiant sales are material for the first time, mostly for Covid treatment. For Incyte, ""Royalties on US bari sales: $???; US physicians getting personal experience with bari: priceless."" One thing investors will get out of this situation is a better handle on bari royalties when the sale was for RA vs ""other indication."" (My first guess is 1/3 the rate when ""other"")."
"look it is pretty easy to understand, herve brags and says we have the best scientific team assembled, yet no outcomes from Incyte pipeline, then herve decides to license other companies assets, the problem here is that they negotiate from weakness as they have no pipeline, thus paying way over value for the assets and then doing a 30 to 50% premium on shares as well. Seems like they have forgotten their own 2 deals they made with NVS and LLY.......and not to mention the assets they are getting no one else wants.........plain and simple wall street hates all herve deals and unfortantely for shareholders herve is not going to stop."
"The Liar writes that he expects the impact of the Calithera settleement to be substantial. The matter was settled with no admission of fault, so maximum financial impact would be limited to the total milestones in the original agreement. If Calithera did not withdraw from R&D participation, that would be $450 MM. If Calithera DID withdraw, it would be $750 MM. However, large milestone payments generally begin with initiation of a phase 3 study, and since no phase 3 trial was entered into clinicaltrials, that didn't happen. Results from the phase 1/2 trial have been posted, and do not clearly suggest that a particular phase 2 trial should have been run (in fact, not all planned study arms were conducted). The most obvious way that two milestone payments could come into dispute would be if Calithera claimed entitlement to a milestone for the arms of the phase 1/2 study that were completed, and on the basis that they were still co-developing the drug, initiated a phase 2 program without prior agreement. The amount at issue could be up to about 20% of the total milestones, or $90MM. A settement value over around $50MM would probably have required immediate disclosure by Incyte, The large Q2 milestone expense MIGHT reflect setting up a reserve against a worst-case result; the $400 MM+ amount is enough to prompt a question, anyway."
"Doesn't seem to be a reason for anything extraordinary at the CC...except that last year's Q3 was appalling and The Liar's thousand slimy emails a day have held expectations down. All Jakafi categories ought to be in line with history (I can imagine some slowing in PV growth; MAYBE an interruption in the trend to start Jakafi earlier in MF. But in PV, Jakafi reduces office visits, A Good Thing, while in MF, life extension with earlier treatment start is directly observed. In aGvHD there's no alternative, while in cGvHD Rezurock is rolling out slowly, and again, Jakafi is a relatively low-office-visit approach. Rollout of Monjuvi will still probably trail management forecasts, but lead everybody else's. The early rollout of Minjuvi might lead a cynic to think management wanted to spread a difficult initial rollout over 2 reporting quarters, but there's simply less room for screw-ups in an institute-heavy German rollout than a less-focused US one. Pemazyre may be interesting, as in massively beating expectations--more histologies have been identified as having anelevated rate of the needed mutation. The way I read clinicaltrials, there shouldn't be many new reads to talk about.Given the share price collapse, financial strength ought to get some air time. A small dividend would be helpful (all the big boys pay them)"
"JMP analyst Benjamin gives INCY an Outperform rating and his $124 price target suggests an impressive 92% potential upside for the coming year. Tommy, stick that in your pipe and smoke it."
