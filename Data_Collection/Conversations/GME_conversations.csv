"Contrary to common belief, there are millions of available shares to short. No naked, black pool conspiracy short selling needed"
"I really should not be saying this. However my uncle works for the SEC, he said they are in the middle of huge gamestop investigation, that could cause the stock to crash. He told me that if i have stock i should sell it now. Glad i listened to him."
"For new comers to this board, be aware that many of the accounts you see are all controlled by the same one person. We call this person ""Charlatan"". They have made many accounts, and constantly change the names on those accounts. They do this to give the impression their voice is much louder and more supported than it really is with the FUD copy/ pastes they always post.A way to see how many fake accounts there are on this forum which are controlled by the same person is to use your phone and download the Yahoo Finance app. This app has a feature where you can ""follow"" other members by clicking on their name and clicking the follow button.

A little suspicious isn't it?"
SP to earnings doesn’t make sense
"AMC was basically bankrupt at $4.00 a share, then it issued 5X as many shares diluting the stock completely."
"When a stock explodes 27.53% in one day, for no-valid business reason, it will collapse FOR VERY valid business reasons! GME here comes $13.44 stock price. Don’t blink"
"WOW, this is the next squeeze look at that VOLUME. $AMC $GME $BB $ATER $MMAT"
I don't know about anyone else here but I am buying shares today we cant let all the recent gains just be erased we need to put buying pressure on these stocks. We have seen a glimpse of what its capable of and I dont want to see it shorted to the previous levels with synthetic shares and manipulation. $AMC $GME BUY AND HOLD !!!!!!!
remember when shills said GME will never reach $200 again lol
One share one cause alway buy in red and hold !
"Why do I never see anyone say they bought the pop when they always say they bought the dips? You guys have it all backwards, you need to buy the pops and not the dips to keep the upward momentum going and force the squeeze you're looking for. And does it really make a difference if you're averaging down or up when you expect it to hit 30,000,000 after the squeeze anyway?"
Lol the people crying “manipulation” when it would be down a few bucks in a day sure are quiet when this rockets $45 in one afternoon. Apparently It’s only manipulation if it’s going down
"So $SPRT ran out of steam because people sold out to $AMC and $GME which took off around 2pm. As people sold to take profits to$L $AMC & $GME, the volume dropped, this was interpreted by a lot of novice investors as a SELL signal since low volume induces fear. Here's today's Volume:19.35M 9:30am -10:30am24.29M 10:30am - 11:30am13.82M 11:30am - 12:30pm9.14M 12:30pm - 1:30pm6.35M 1:30pm - 2:30pm4.54M 2:30pm - 3:30pm2.23M 3:30pm - 4:00pmhad no one sold out, wet would've probably went right past $15 and probably settled at ~$14 or so.

The average GME investor ...
If HF's dip GME im gonna buy more
I don't have to make money. I don't have to even be involved with the stock.Just knowing that a bunch of call buying yolo redditards lost everything helps me sleep well at night. The universe has a way of setting things right.
$GME has $712.5M in Debt
Bought 8 more shears
We've seen this before. This is exactly what happened too $GME and $AMC. SI the same. The plan is the same. Next week we will see 100$. Mark this post.
Can you smell the rocket fuel right now?
"@Bill with 50 yrs of Finra compliance were you able to find your so incorrectly deemed by you, ""insider trading information"" on BUY and SELL GME STONK? Hey, maybe you can explain to everyone here why you received 20 dislikes and no likes in 40 minutes, in your expert opinion."
Let's go with the true crooked narrative of criminal stock manipulations and trying to corner GameStop shares...
everyone place very high limit sell orders so they can't borrow our shares anymore to short.spread the word!
how high is this going?????????? $300?
"So, what is fueling the latest rally in the Meme stocks ? There was some excitement about the the new FINRA rules..Well, the FINRA rule is in place. Is there any other reason ?"
"If you own $GME shares, your third eye is open."
Shills trying to act like an executive team built on amazon executives is a bad thing LOL
Last chance at 200. SELL.
"Not to rain on your parade but don't forget that during our downward trend over the past 3 months, there have been 3 other separate occasions (avg 1 per month) when GME has had similar spikes in 2 days, so we're due for another one anyway.... Stutes/funds just pumping up the volatility again to make the premiums for options more expensive again. They've been making Billions right under your noses by just writing (selling) them... just sayin'."
I wonder at what entry level I should buy? maybe mid 100's.
Will this stock ever b truly investigate d??!!
holding is free. and 200 for a ticket to the moon is a sale. Buy a share now
"I wonder if this is a head fake. While I know this is not a Ponzi scheme, it still needs unlimited buyers to continue going up and beyond that to keep the price up. Why else would the price crash from 483 to 150. The Reddit crowd ran out of buyers. Still no fundamentals either and no news to cause this run up."
"""I am bearish on $AMC and $GME, but readily acknowledge it is heavily manipulated -- why else would these stocks stay up so high? It is because many are making a fortune selling calls and puts."""
going to $40million
Let's GO GME!!!!!!!!
"When flying under the radar without the spotlight of being a famous meme like it is now, it only took 3 months to squeeze GME with its 140% short interest back in Jan.... the biggest short squeeze in history. Bravo!!!....7 months later while claiming shorts never covered (lol) and the spotlight on them this time, with just 12% short interest, there's been nothing but yoyo's for the yolo Lambozo crowd....Anyone wonder why it's taking so long this time?....No wonder needed. It's 'not' happening again.... just like lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place again.Suggest you just put on your tiny tin foil hats that fit your heads perfectly and climb to the top of the tallest tree during the next thunderstorm. Can't hurt to try."
We'll now likely see a retest of the 50 day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $179
"Pop Quiz :If the Hedgies closed the short, how come the lost another $Billion on GME & AMC on just one trading day this week?Hint : Because they never closed, they just hid it, using all the dirty tricks in the book."
"NFT game rights are going to modernize the used games market. You buy the rights to a copy of the game, and you can cryptographically prove that you're entitled to install it. Then you can resell the game and the smart contract can be coded so that the developer gets a small cut of the used game market too. Consumers benefit from resold game pricing, developers benefit from an additional source of passive revenue. This also gives developers incentive to produce quality because the longer the market for a game stays alive, the more passive income they get. And of course, as the designers of the technology, GameStop gets a tiny sliver of every tx."
"This thread is littered with boiler room hedge fund employees. If $AMC and $GME weren’t much of a threat, why is so much of the retail buying sent via the dark pool? Why does buy orders outweigh selling orders on the daily? Why do hedge funds sell their shorts into the open market, yet delay retail buy orders? Why is a shorting hedge fund a market maker? And the paid bears call this all a conspiracy."
I will take short position if GME go above $240. You will never lose money in the short of 240 ranges.
Wow I had another millian doler day trading gme.!
"""Going to the moon, back up the truck, it will hit 300 by Friday, I am buying more""....... oh and post a GIF to prove your intelligence."
"I can smell the FOMO from here, tomorrow will be interesting for sure.LETS GO $GME LONGS"
Zero shares available. 55% interest to borrow. 55%! For comparison it's only 1.2% to borrow $AMC shares and 0.6% for $GMECall options are going to make this squeeze so hard.
Wen $5? Wen Bankrupt?
"Tomorrow, will be a day for the history books. GMErica will be in everyone's mouth."
Pokemon Card Game Preorders sold out in 1 minute. $GAMESTOP $GMEI just like the stock.
"For such a wild move yesterday, outstanding options didn't really do anything.. ???I checked the options outstanding, and it looks much smaller than the last several weeks..Yesterday's wild move didn't really result in much new options writing.. It is hard to even guess a max-pain point for this week.."
"It's all about the options, folks, they want the options in BBIG to be dead come Friday. Do not give them the satisfaction, hold for BBIG's dividend in the NFT company. Once $BBIG goes over $10, all of $BBIG's call options will be in the money, and then the $GME starts, who knows, maybe $100 a share for $BBIG, or maybe even $400 a share for $BBIG."
If you’re new to this board you should know many of the bearish accounts are all controlled by the same person. They will talk to themselves using multiple accounts and constantly change names to give the impression there are many of them. If you use the yahoo financials app on your phone you can “follow” members. This will allow you to see what this person constantly changes their account names to. Doing this will allow you to see how many fake bearish accounts there are on this board posting FUD.
Just a few months ago 5 mill share offered at more than 220 a share. Like I said undervalued imo
Absolutely despicable tactics by hedge funds and shill pumpers on here and Reddit trying to lure in unsuspecting investors. Fundamentals DO matter when it comes to investing. This will crater and be under $100 by end of week. Contact your attorney and name all these shameless pumpers on here and Reddit.
When a small retail store has a market cap greater than steel and equipment manufacturers. Something is wrong. SELL.
This should be a $100+ stock very easily by end of year. The new $GME !!!
"When Payment for Order Flow is taken off the table, GME will be a $5 share stock again..because the only thing propping it is the spread manipulation by the market markets at Citidel and the fractional share app 'brokerages'. They spin the price up and down at will on the basis of 1 or two shares trading and so when all the 'at market' requests for buy and sell come in, they just adjust the quote to compel the very next trade after that to be higher (usually)....repeated quickly and it looks like a rally that no one can ever push back down."
where have all the shills gone?

"If this dips im gonna buy more, so its up to you HFs"
Are you still buying GME?Me:
Get outta here day traders. Can't stop Gamestop. I said we closing stronger today.
buying more!
10% increase in short positions today. They're digging their own grave just like $GME and $AMC
$250 calls trading nicely!
9/9 and GME goes parabolic.
"GME & $AMC just keep on climbing, more millionaire printed today...READ the ACRX news out today! Under the radar, game changer to all having SURGERY in the coming weeks, months, years... READ the ACRX news!"
$BBIG is the only true stock that can become $GME. Thumbs up who agree.
"I think they're using $BBIG to distract people from $SPRT just like they used $AMC to distract people from $GME.And this is the biggest bull sign.To people in either stocks, I highly recommend you just hold, and only buy other stocks with new funds, if you sell, the stock you're holding would never squeeze, that's just science!"
Priceless. Doesn't get any better than this. lol
Shorts b thinking? Short and double down ? I can make it work? It will not get higher only lower? Michael jordan still has nightmares
"Discussion of facts; why another squeeze on GME is IMPOSSIBLE:1) as of 8/13/2021 short interest in GME is a scant 11.98%. An extreme difference from the legendary 150% shorts in January. In spite of the repetitive & obnoxious lies by the many internet shills, relatively speaking, shorts ARE fully covered2) the 2020 Dec $14 stock price with a $1 billion market cap can be manipulated 15X easier than a $200 stock price and a $15 billion market cap. Apes can't manipulate GME at these lofty levels cuz their financial assets are relatively extremely insignificant. 3) GME has issued 5 million new shares in 2021, substantially diluting share holder value. Double-trouble of reducing share holder value and fully insulating GME from any chance of a second squeeze4) epic squeezes happen, maybe, once in a lifetime - not every 6 months. But a Dreamer can dream!!5) off on a tangent, yet pertinent; apes are similar to a competitive sports team of 17 year olds in that they can't create/find any new players with the honed talent - yet these high level athletes dropout due to: burnout, studies, girlfriends, other interests, injuries,... - apes are also losing their 'rank n file' primarily to the Secret Society Of Massively Profitable Paper Hands, with no consequential 'new recruits' to join the current apes as the sad & lonely band of eventual Bag Holders 6) couple those facts with: Blockbuster 2.0, no business plan, negative eps, Top Execs quitting en masse, thousands of expensive/unwanted retail store rental space contracts, massive Insider selling... all of that negative synergy creates a horrendous stock that ""screams sell"" to all with active grey matter. For that remaining contrarian group, please take comfort in knowing that there will be a spattering of brighter days ahead for the stock price of GME, with impressive potential stock spikes over any random period of time... as it steadily marches-on toward its eventual destiny of $13.44"
The new $GME squeeze is here. 
It’s Monday again. A beautiful day to hold my favorite stock.
Happy Friday everyone. $GME is looking good !! Quiet today and next week is gonna be amazing !!
"Looks like the hedgefunds are doing everything in their power to keep GameStop from returning to the NYSE threshold securities list, which triggered the almost-squeeze back in January. It's possible that the hedgefunds/marketmakers let GME move from Russell 2000 to Russel 1000 to S&P in order to gain access to different ETF's, where they could hide their shorts/FTD's. Buy and hold, the greedy hedgefunds will have to cover their shorts sooner or later! Floor is $30M/share, let's goooooo! "
"Same as Yesterday, Max Pain is $170. So don't expect it to fluctuate too far from this point."
gonna be a lot of skid marks on shortleys underwear this week
"I really should not be saying this. However my uncle works for the SEC, he said they are in the middle of huge Gamestop investigation, that could cause the stock to crash. He told me that i should sell it now before its too late. Glad i listened to him."
"""this just in, totally non manipulated stock rises 27.53% in one day for unknown reasons."""
power hour!
DUmping this stock was the best trade ever...
GME is like giving a 5 year old 10 billion dollars to run a lemonade stand in their front yard
still long AMC leap calls.. $300 for GME today?
"cushion theory - the price is suppressed because the stock is heavily shorted and will increase by a very large amount after shorts cover. Think about it.... why is this sticking around 200 and not dropping below at all! Buy GME, Hold GME, Marry GME"
Looks like a lot of the HODL crowd aren't HODLing. Looks like profit taking if ever I saw it. HE'S are way to smart to short much right now.
the price is wrong. the market is manipulating. holding till suppression is no more
"GME $300 coming!!! eyeing ACRX, strong Buy out; ACRX Yahoo Finance price target = 590% upside!!!"
One share one cause ! Buy only when you afford to hold forever ! Do not get greedy Ike the shorts do !
"Hey Bears where/when is the dip to $40 you have been saying would happen since March? My reserve funds are burning a hole in my pocket, I want more $40 shares."
load the boat massive squeeze next week when earnings arrive
Gamestop is the beginning and the end. $GME There will be no other like it.
"This is so unreal.. !!! I guess the Meme trade is back in earnest..There was some stimulus payment, which may be a factor. But I think some HFs are playing it on the long side to make a huge momentum profit.I hope the Apes buy up all they can right now so that return to sanity can also be as spectacular as the rise."
"Something changed big last week. Options volume, and # of outstanding down drastically.. What is the game now ? Does any sane person here understand ?"
too late to get in GME?
Imagine trying to keep GameStop a secret. It’s been over $145 for months now. Lmao SHORTS HAVE NOT COVERED - this means they will have to exit and buy shares at whatever price they can. Buy the dip. $gme the mother of all short squeezes is near
When will they learn…WERE NOT LEAVING! *yawn*
"remember when one of the shills had an ""uncle at the SEC"" who assured us the stock is going down?"

Hehehe to short a company over 100% is not a good idea
One way ticket to the moon!!!
"Reddit investors had The Perfect Plan: id low cost stock that’s highly shorted. Have the Army buy said stock forcing stock price up 20X. Sell that stock. Take the army, now 20X richer, to plunder the next stock. The plan would have worked FOREVER. Everyone would be rich beyond their dreams!! Imagine investing say, $6,000 and two months later selling at $120.000Repeat this feat two more times and the initial $6k would be worth $48 MILLION But they never sold & simply forgot their mission. They married GME & AMC and now risk watching their hard work and profits go for naught. Why did they forget the SELL component?? So sad."
"And if you guys had just spent your money at GameStop instead of constantly buying their stock, do you have any idea what their earnings results would've been? Just look at the volume in all of Q2, divide it in 1/2, multiply it by 200 and add that to their revs instead. Again, you've got it all backwards. lol"
Have a great weekend Ape Family! $AMC $GME
I just like the stock
"Stop thinking too much, tell your friends and everyone around you (family and colleagues) to sell their other position and go all-in on GME. Everyone needs to collect the GME shares, it means the float will be owned by us and when the hedgies will have to cover the price will jump excessively high!"
When the shills are met with logic they don't reply and just downvote with each of their accounts. Like for instance why us shareholders should be listening to people who change accounts and copy and paste the same things? Still looking for an answer but none of you shills are going to respond with any type of argument. NO CELL NO SELL
"Not all the downvotes here you see are from shills. There's regular retail investors out there like us who hold a grudge against GME because they sold for a loss instead of averaging down. They have a vendetta against GME now which has become even more intense because they are now (and have been) losing money on puts hoping they can profit off other people losing money. They still don't understand GME is no longer a ""meme stock"". Eventually their puts will expire worthless and they'll still be salty about losing so much to GME when all they had to do the entire time was buy and hold."
Buying more at the opening
this is the next $GME lets go!
"GME  Call your wife, kids, parents, siblings, and friendsTell them that you're going 'all in' with your investment into AMC and/or GameStop, because it's the most important, wealth-transferring move of all of our lifetimes. Tell them that they should join you and buy while they still can. I am.The MOASS Gamma Squeeze will be historic; it'll allow for the highest stock gains your account has ever seen. It's sitting on our doorsteps. We just have to pick it up."
Any of you shills out there please explain to me how a bunch of people who are proven to switch accounts and telling us shareholders to sell would be at all creditable? Do you really think any of you have gotten anyone to sell your just proving our point even further. I don't know if you are paid to convince people or just paid per post but honestly I wonder how some of you are even able to work a computer. Now watch I'll only get a shill or two to respond too LOL !!!!
"Guys I think Yahoo Finance is broken, it doesn't show $40 like all these people have been preaching for months, why does it show $210?"
Hedgies doing what they gotta do to get the price below 210. What's so magic about 210? Is Marge calling if over that price???
Michael Jordan is here to get Apes for bad mouthing him always for his GameStop short.
"So with the new margin / short-selling rules from FINRA, have we heard the last of the ""2000% short"" using ""SYNTHETIC"" shares ... ??NOTE : Except Barren's repeated play-rewind-loop ""The HFs never covered"""
"When the hedgies push the price down to make people scared and sell.. we buy more. When the price goes up, we buy more. The only thing that can make me stop buying is my death... So if they want me to stop buying GameStop... They have to kill me. This stock will go to the moon and beyond the moon.. i don't care how much they try to push the price down... It will not work. WE already are the #$%$#$&_$#@ING WINNERS here. To the moon and Mars and allt the stars you can find in this universe."
"Almost time to get the Monday morning trading underway and I've added funds to my trading account, ready to buy up a few more wonderful GME shares this morning. There has already been some interesting trading during pre-market this morning, so I suspect we'll see some more shenanigan's from the desperate HFs as market opens. Buckle up everyone !!"
Get ready for big upward movement in the coming days
$GME POPPING UP$AMC WILL BE NEXTGOOD LUCK AMC APES!!!
Going to be a good day
"GameStop has transformed its entire executive leadership from traditional retail to eCommerceGameStop has a strong balance sheet to support its transformationGameStop is building best-in-class customer careGameStop is massively increasing product offeringsGameStop has potential to be a social hub for gamersGameStop has potential through long term acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships"
More dip please!!
"I wonder how many shareholders have read the GME financial statements. The ratio of assets to liabilities has shrunk considerably over the past 5 years, the income statement keeps shrinking and the company has reported losses to the tune of $1.35 billion in the last 3 years. I understand a lot want to wage war on the shorts, but what will they be left with after they squeeze?"
"Not only are NFT's not cryptos with any potential dividend involved, NFT's would require GME to own the 'rights' to a game and 'mint' it first in the ethereum blockchain with some hefty gas fees involved before 'copies' can even be sold. Also, anyone buying would need to own ethereum by establishing a crypto wallet first and then pay about $3 to transfer from one wallet to another and that's on top of the cost of the game itself, new or used. Most important, since crypto's are traded 24/7, its actual value may change dramatically before you even check out. So how's that gonna work? And if they actually pay to own the exclusive rights to a game, why do they even need an NFT? Not a crypto/nft expert, but it seems to me that GME only started down this road to keep the apes excited (""crypto"" being the magic buzz word) and to perpetuate its meme status just to help keep its price propped before their secondary offerings. So the fact they actually hired some NFT staff could just be window dressing.Will someone please educate me otherwise? much appreciated, thxreport away"
"btw: In a nutshell, trading isn't about being right all the time. It's about diversifying, being right more than wrong and the higher the batting average the better. That's pretty much it. Good luck at the plate.PS: DD is just studying the pitcher while in the dugout and while on deck for a closer look."
I think I am going to buy another share today. Anyone care to join me?
I TOLD YOU GUYS WOOOOOOO$AMC and $GME TO THE MOON
gravy train to money town
GameStop is the greatest story in financial history. This is payback for what you did in 2008 to all working families. $GME
I’ve seen this go from 200 to 400 back in January. Don’t underestimate this stock
I'm so jealous in a good way everyone who bought ton of shares below $50 and can now sell every week crazy expensive covered calls. Just easy bag money
"Strong balance sheet, top leadership, growing market, dominant position on the market. I´m in."
Charist called BABA at $150 now is saying this about $GME and meme stockshttps://lussosnews.com/exclusive-chartist-weighs-in-on-meme-stocks/
"This week, options volumes were much much smaller than last few weeks..Has the nature and motivation of the ""game"" changed ?Or the big players just stood by, not taking the risk - sensing that the Apes were about to launch another coordinated attack ???"
Buying more GME today
"￼￼It’s called a margin call. Ready, say it with me, margin call￼. It will continue to happen and share price will continue to rise.￼ HOLD."
Love GME
GameStop>Amazon
"JohnD8 hours agoReplied to a reactionGameStop Corp.@Ryan Yes Cohen created a new business with Chewy and managed to sell it to Petsmart for 3.5B, so well done to him for that. However Chewy is now worth 40B and all of that happened after he left.... 90% of Chewy valuation is without RC involvement. As I said RC created a new business...None of his new directors have created a new business. More importantly RC and None of his new directors have any history in turning around a failing business that is a different set of skills. The VW analogy is completely irrelevant to GameStop. The nature of the squeeze was entirely different, created by one company Porsche, not hoards of small investors. Even at the time of VW being shorted VW at least had quality products and a quality business which GameStop doesn't. At the time of the squeeze VW went from around 200 to 1000 a five fold increase. GameStop in January has already experienced it's proportionally much larger squeeze... It's not going to have a bigger second squeeze. VW didn't have a second squeeze. And now 13 years later what is the current price of VWAG? Surprisingly back to pretty much where it was pre squeeze.... And this is a quality manufacturer that has in the Volkswagen Audi Group (VW,Audi,Seat,Skoda,Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti). Yes the similarity between VW and GameStop is identical LOL. It would behove you to perform even the slightest research before typing."
Gamestop will run their own Web Services because they will be self reliant and have the leadership to do so.Blockchain and video gaming is just the cherry on top.
They call it a meme stock because they're afraid.
"Close your eyes and buy, don't try to think too much about it. Also spread the word everywhere that everyone on earth has to buy."
Holding GME + AMC. These are the last opportunities for a naked shorted short squeeze. The market wont let it happen again. God speed to you all!!
2nd lowest daily volume in years and top 2 in just the past 3 days.
"I am still scratching my head about the spike yesterday. Someone said yesteday that there was some FINRA short-selling rule change that took effect.Don't know if that is true, but if that is true, I can guess the amount of chatter and excitement and FOMO it would have created in the Ape echo chambers !!!All I can say is that : I hoped at least they won't use the ""2000% synthetic short"", ""the HFs never covered"", .. all those theories anymore..But alas, Barren is back with the same ""The HFs never covered... $30 million is the floor"" play-rewind loop already !!!So nothing really changes.. no matter what vote count takes place, what short-selling rule changes... There is still hope of THAT ONE MOASS... that nobody knows what value to place on it.. Except Barren.."
GME is about explode. Another massive run is Inevitable.

A couple min later, he deletes it and says it couldn't have been him since he was out to lunch.....which begs the question, how many @Dan's do we have and both just happened to be logged onto my thread at the same time, within a couple min of each other? And when he said we, how many we's are we talking about, ea with 30 ids?.....I also replied it makes sense they'd keep accusing shorts of being paid since just a way to 'try' to deflect the suspicion away from themselves and have experienced it too many times in life already, unfortunately, see it clearly....Did it work for you?What a Farce!!!.... Time to take Shamburger Hill again"

"When this thing truly enters MOASS numbers, oh my, INFINITE RISK!!!!!!!!!! Can’t you smell it just around the corner?"
"Good morning fellow longs! Yesterday we saw the lowest volume in months, not even a million shares traded even though the hedgefunds borrowed/shorted additional shares. The message is clear; we're not selling! The hedgefunds never covered back in January, short interest is most likely several thousand percent! The floor is $30M/share, let's goooooo! "
GME & ACRX my top 2 buys. Yahoo Finance PT on ACRX = 600% upside!
"For anyone new to this conversation, I just want you to take a minute and do the following:1. Go take a look at any other ""normal"" stock, be it Google, Amazon, or any random stock, and see the difference between those conversations and the one here. Do you see a ton of people telling you it's garbage and you should sell? Tip: The answer is no. Now ask yourself WHY people want you to sell ONLY the stocks that are believed to have an exceptionally high number of shorts. Also, why are people here so concerned about YOUR investment, but don't seem to care of your invested in other companies?2. Understand that wall street has a history full of lies regarding shorting (among many things), including hiding short positions by marking them as long, hiding them in options and swaps, or even bold faced lying.3. Consider whether or not they truly closed their shorts back in January, and ask yourself how they've lost billions since then if they actually closed their short positions.4. Understand that short positions come with the potential for UNLIMITED loss.5. Understand the concept of supply and demand. Many GME holders believe that the float has been shorted a MINIMUM of 100%, and some hint at it being MUCH more than that. If a short hedge fund fails a margin call, then they will have to buy shares at whatever price. That means if you hold shares, YOU set your price, and fundamentals are irrelevant. They need it, you have it, you choose your price.6. Go check out Reddit, and start with House of Cards, and work your way through that first. It speaks both to this stock, and the state of the stock market in general.Btw, you'll notice a lot of negative word for word posts here, and it's clear that they are likely the same 2 or 3 people with multiple accounts. Ask yourself why someone would bother to not only constantly comment on a stock they don't own, and furthermore, run multiple accounts to speak poorly of the stock.This is not financial advice, but rather, just some things to consider. Make your own decisions, and do your research."
Hurry and sell before its too late.You heard it here first...
Where are the bears at?
We will never see under $200 again. $gme
Uh oh pre market down 3.5%. Quickly better sell!
"Once in a lifetime chance to get in. Be the 0,01% of the population that owns the moon ticket."
How many GME have you bought? I have 46 shares.. it's not much but its enough to make me rich... I will keep buying more every time I can. I sold much of my art. I keep selling my art. To the point... I think that today may be the last chance to buy this low.. BUY AND HOLD
When they said we would be left bag holding I don't think they imagine it would actually be a bag of money
I`m putting my money where i think i will get maximum gain.Right now i don`t see any better alternative than the Stonk.
"I buy shares of $GME everyday and one of my market values of a share was $498Dark pools are hiding the true price of shares,volume is low because they can not find shares!"
was that back to 10.00 this week or next week? asking for a friend.
A finish above $200 is a huge win.
Any realistic chance it can hit $300 during upcoming results?
"The Market may have started a correction. The HFs will get margin calls. They will reduce exposure. That means, they will cover GME and AMC short positions.Remember, HFs never covered. There are actually not 16% short, but 2000% short through ""SYNTHETIC shares"" - for goooooodness sake, whatever that means.. We just need to believe the 2000% number. The day of reckoning for the HFs is near, Apes !!!Just buy, buy, buy, ... 0.3 shares, 0.5 shares .. whatever you can, whenever you can. Take out a payday loan to buy GME and AMC. You will be rewarded handsomely. When the MOASS starts, $30 million / share becomes the floor. And there would be no ceiling.. You name your price..And guess what ! If the MOASS never happens, even if you lose everything you ""invested"", you have been already placed in the history books for what you were able to do in January by merely licking the b---t of DFV / roaring kitty !!That glory alone, is worth more than your lifetime savings !!!"
"Do not stop buying, it's important, keep on buying and don't sell, the hedge funds and market maker wants your shares ! Don't give them away ! GME will be 300$+ in a few days!"
"There is only one GME!!!!! No stock has done what this baby has done. It's f..... up alot of the old traders......They are use to being in control. Redditters,The robin Hoodies and the young newbies have changed the game forever!"
SPRT IS FLYING $AMC $GME $tslaIt's time to make the life Changing money. Get in before it's too late. I just loaded up. Will see 40 at least by EOD. Mark this post.
Bag holding...
"I have 46 shares and won't sell a single one... Apes hold. I can wait.. as long as it takes. I won't sell at 100k, not one million $, not 10 million $.. many 6 shares at 20 million dollar, and the other 40 i will sell at 30 & 40 million dollar.. this will be insane and super fun. I will use the money to help sick and poor people, pay for my familys house's, by a nice car with a nice house and many dogs. It's important to make good things with the money we will get.. we won't like to end up like the hedgies.. They only care about themselves..we are not like them. We care about others."
Profit margins are now officially cut in half on online app and game sales by Google and Apple. MSFT has also pledged to drop to as low as a 10% profit margin.
I went to GME store and nobody was there..
"So DTCC raises margin requirements from 10k to 250k. The stock runs +45%, What does this tell you?"
$260 before power hour.
It is green. All of the shills have the day off again.
Now that was a real fun quick trip to the moon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

T+2?
Cannabis? Blockchain? Video Games? Gamestop.
Does anyone have any explanation for the price action today in GME and AMC ? And to an extent in HOOD too ?
"""All short sellers are eventually buyers"" imagine that you could make millions investing like everyone else but instead you spend 50 years rigging the system to siphon funds from America's retirement funds and pension plans into wallstreet bonuses, the Hamptons in Greenwich CT, and Ferraris. well, not anymore you greedy worms, now you have to cover and you will be paying US!"
WOW what a great stock!! I am very wealthy. Thinking of buying a new boat. The bigger the better. I made a bill on dolers on this stock after my well endowed uncles left me a milloan dolers in his will. Now I am a billinaire
"Remember this is only the T+35 date, just wait till they actually cover $GME $SPRT $AMC 70% SI let's do this squeeze right"
"Time for a big short squeeze on Dynavax, $DVAX, a maker of adjuvants, ie boosters, for vaccines, used by Medigen in Taiwan's first locally produced vaccine, Valneva, making vaccines for UK and EU, and Clover and Biologic E. DVAX already up 10% yesterday, 25% this month, with catalysts to come and shorts vulnerable."
"Love GME, gonna buy more today"
Level 2 showing Shorts selling back and forth couple of shares to artificially move the price down. They tried the same thing with $GME. Buy and hold. Its that simple.
I have no urgency to sell whatsoever. I actually have some urgency to double my position if I'm honest
This show is over. Put your gameboys down and sell this before its too late. Set to crash. Back to 10.00 end of week guaranteed. You can trust me on this one.
Watching all the shorts cry priceless. THEM Still thinking Millennials are teens in basements Classic. HAHA
