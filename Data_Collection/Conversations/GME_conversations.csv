"I really should not be saying this. However my uncle works for the SEC, he said they are in the middle of huge gamestop investigation, that could cause the stock to crash. He told me that if i have stock i should sell it now. Glad i listened to him."
Are you still buying GME?Me:
"Remember to use the phone app so that you can ""follow"" the FUD spreaders to see how often they change their names. You can do this by clicking their name, and clicking ""follow"" in the top right side of the window that pops up showing their history. A person we call ""Charlatan"" has many accounts and constantly changes their names in order to give the illusion there are many of them. By using the follow feature of Yahoo Finance's phone app I can see that some of ""Charlatan's"" recent account name switches are,Chico MaltaWillyCecila Heart"
Absolutely despicable tactics by hedge funds and shill pumpers on here and Reddit trying to lure in unsuspecting investors. Fundamentals DO matter when it comes to investing. This will crater and be under $100 by end of week. Contact your attorney and name all these shameless pumpers on here and Reddit.
"So, what is fueling the latest rally in the Meme stocks ? There was some excitement about the the new FINRA rules..Well, the FINRA rule is in place. Is there any other reason ?"
GameStop is the greatest story in financial history. This is payback for what you did in 2008 to all working families. $GME
Any realistic chance it can hit $300 during upcoming results?
Get out of $HOOD immediately..$AMC $GME debacle is gonna take down the company
Will this stock ever b truly investigate d??!!
"Something changed big last week. Options volume, and # of outstanding down drastically.. What is the game now ? Does any sane person here understand ?"
Does anyone have any explanation for the price action today in GME and AMC ? And to an extent in HOOD too ?
"For anyone new to this conversation, I just want you to take a minute and do the following:1. Go take a look at any other ""normal"" stock, be it Google, Amazon, or any random stock, and see the difference between those conversations and the one here. Do you see a ton of people telling you it's garbage and you should sell? Tip: The answer is no. Now ask yourself WHY people want you to sell ONLY the stocks that are believed to have an exceptionally high number of shorts. Also, why are people here so concerned about YOUR investment, but don't seem to care of your invested in other companies?2. Understand that wall street has a history full of lies regarding shorting (among many things), including hiding short positions by marking them as long, hiding them in options and swaps, or even bold faced lying.3. Consider whether or not they truly closed their shorts back in January, and ask yourself how they've lost billions since then if they actually closed their short positions.4. Understand that short positions come with the potential for UNLIMITED loss.5. Understand the concept of supply and demand. Many GME holders believe that the float has been shorted a MINIMUM of 100%, and some hint at it being MUCH more than that. If a short hedge fund fails a margin call, then they will have to buy shares at whatever price. That means if you hold shares, YOU set your price, and fundamentals are irrelevant. They need it, you have it, you choose your price.6. Go check out Reddit, and start with House of Cards, and work your way through that first. It speaks both to this stock, and the state of the stock market in general.Btw, you'll notice a lot of negative word for word posts here, and it's clear that they are likely the same 2 or 3 people with multiple accounts. Ask yourself why someone would bother to not only constantly comment on a stock they don't own, and furthermore, run multiple accounts to speak poorly of the stock.This is not financial advice, but rather, just some things to consider. Make your own decisions, and do your research."
"I wonder how many shareholders have read the GME financial statements. The ratio of assets to liabilities has shrunk considerably over the past 5 years, the income statement keeps shrinking and the company has reported losses to the tune of $1.35 billion in the last 3 years. I understand a lot want to wage war on the shorts, but what will they be left with after they squeeze?"
"I think they're using $BBIG to distract people from $SPRT just like they used $AMC to distract people from $GME.And this is the biggest bull sign.To people in either stocks, I highly recommend you just hold, and only buy other stocks with new funds, if you sell, the stock you're holding would never squeeze, that's just science!"
They had some interesting insights about GME on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
When the shills are met with logic they don't reply and just downvote with each of their accounts. Like for instance why us shareholders should be listening to people who change accounts and copy and paste the same things? Still looking for an answer but none of you shills are going to respond with any type of argument. NO CELL NO SELL
"So with the new margin / short-selling rules from FINRA, have we heard the last of the ""2000% short"" using ""SYNTHETIC"" shares ... ??NOTE : Except Barren's repeated play-rewind-loop ""The HFs never covered"""
$260 before power hour.
"When Payment for Order Flow is taken off the table, GME will be a $5 share stock again..because the only thing propping it is the spread manipulation by the market markets at Citidel and the fractional share app 'brokerages'. They spin the price up and down at will on the basis of 1 or two shares trading and so when all the 'at market' requests for buy and sell come in, they just adjust the quote to compel the very next trade after that to be higher (usually)....repeated quickly and it looks like a rally that no one can ever push back down."
Watching all the shorts cry priceless. THEM Still thinking Millennials are teens in basements Classic. HAHA
GME is like giving a 5 year old 10 billion dollars to run a lemonade stand in their front yard
If you’re new to this board you should know many of the bearish accounts are all controlled by the same person. They will talk to themselves using multiple accounts and constantly change names to give the impression there are many of them. If you use the yahoo financials app on your phone you can “follow” members. This will allow you to see what this person constantly changes their account names to. Doing this will allow you to see how many fake bearish accounts there are on this board posting FUD.
"Reddit investors had The Perfect Plan: id low cost stock that’s highly shorted. Have the Army buy said stock forcing stock price up 20X. Sell that stock. Take the army, now 20X richer, to plunder the next stock. The plan would have worked FOREVER. Everyone would be rich beyond their dreams!! Imagine investing say, $6,000 and two months later selling at $120.000Repeat this feat two more times and the initial $6k would be worth $48 MILLION But they never sold & simply forgot their mission. They married GME & AMC and now risk watching their hard work and profits go for naught. Why did they forget the SELL component?? So sad."
I have no urgency to sell whatsoever. I actually have some urgency to double my position if I'm honest
"When a stock explodes 27.53% in one day, for no-valid business reason, it will collapse FOR VERY valid business reasons! GME here comes $13.44 stock price. Don’t blink"
I'm so jealous in a good way everyone who bought ton of shares below $50 and can now sell every week crazy expensive covered calls. Just easy bag money
Imagine trying to keep GameStop a secret. It’s been over $145 for months now. Lmao SHORTS HAVE NOT COVERED - this means they will have to exit and buy shares at whatever price they can. Buy the dip. $gme the mother of all short squeezes is near
Happy Friday everyone. $GME is looking good !! Quiet today and next week is gonna be amazing !!
"""this just in, totally non manipulated stock rises 27.53% in one day for unknown reasons."""
"GameStop has transformed its entire executive leadership from traditional retail to eCommerceGameStop has a strong balance sheet to support its transformationGameStop is building best-in-class customer careGameStop is massively increasing product offeringsGameStop has potential to be a social hub for gamersGameStop has potential through long term acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships"
"cushion theory - the price is suppressed because the stock is heavily shorted and will increase by a very large amount after shorts cover. Think about it.... why is this sticking around 200 and not dropping below at all! Buy GME, Hold GME, Marry GME"
"""I am bearish on $AMC and $GME, but readily acknowledge it is heavily manipulated -- why else would these stocks stay up so high? It is because many are making a fortune selling calls and puts."""
"""Going to the moon, back up the truck, it will hit 300 by Friday, I am buying more""....... oh and post a GIF to prove your intelligence."
"Contrary to common belief, there are millions of available shares to short. No naked, black pool conspiracy short selling needed"
When a small retail store has a market cap greater than steel and equipment manufacturers. Something is wrong. SELL.
holding is free. and 200 for a ticket to the moon is a sale. Buy a share now
