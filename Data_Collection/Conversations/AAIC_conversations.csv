"""Turning to our actual results for the quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $0.52 per share and core operating income of $0.32 per share. "" ---From their earnings call.Gee, I'm almost impressed. If they can keep this up, they could actually fund their dividend and have money to invest."
Dude what happen to AI? I been out a few years but didnt this use to be $20 stock? I would like to invest some especially since they were able to raise some capital over the last few months but seems alarming... why cant management just leave things simple. They try to oversmart themselves adding bets to interest rates when all we want is income through leverage.
"Changing ticker from ""AI"" to ""AAIC""....with no explanation why. There are costs in doing so. Trying to hide past?"
"Common share dividend could be reinstated for Q4, depending on core earnings as reported in the upcoming ER. Huge discount to BV in the meantime. And finally, based on 90+% of the posts here, the sentiment is clearly lousy. All adds up to a GREAT SPECULATIVE BUY."
Arlington Asset Investment declares $0.225 dividend
hopefully this stock will gain momentum soon. but still making it with dividends help so far
"Love the commentary by those ""expert"" types....from Simply Wall Street:""The general public holds a substantial 59% stake in Arlington Asset Investment, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.""Ok, all you public investors, start swaying the key decisions!!"
I think Everyone would feel better about this stock if it could hold its stock price. It not and the Board needs to be paid based on performance. I think they need to show stock holders they have skin in the game. they need to set up a target price above where we are at today with at least a 5 to 10 percent increase per quarter.
"I can breath easier now that the $.55 has been declared. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see an increase.Ken"
Will I ever get above water? Jeez.
AAIC is rated the worst in a recent study!Really?
"Why isn't This Fund Holding its price, It pays a great dividend but can't hold its Stock Price. Can someone Explain?"
"""Roll another one....just like the other one!"""
"I have not checked my Fidelity acct for years! My 27500 shares of AAIC has lost $395,419.04 or 79.52% with an average cost basis of $18.08! Such a deal!"
How about a liquidation?
This company is being run for the benefit of management not share holders. Vote your shares to punish management and the board. fire them all.
"I noted a comment that buying under book value is smart. Totally WRONG. Ever asked yourself why anyone would TRADE below BV? Simple - GAAP BV is a false measure of the discounted future earnings!!And even accepting your thesis, 4.06 is a joke. They are merely pumping their own stock at the expense of shareholders.Time to Investigate!"
Anyone want to wager on a common dividend?
Up 2 centavo's!
"The Executive Compensation table for 2017 shows Eric F. Billings, the Executive Chairman receiving $3,072,617 in Incentive Plan, Stock Awards and other compensation. Likewise, J.Rock Tonkel, Jr., Chief Executive Officer and President received $3,072,438. My question is with the dividend being cut from .55 to .375 per sh/quarter, and the stock price falling into the mid tens, how does management justify their large compensation? Also there is $139.00 of cash per share, a very very large amount of funds for this C Corporation to be holding, Why can't management award some of these funds to the deserving shareholders instead of awarding themselves with increasingly high compensations?Value1"
