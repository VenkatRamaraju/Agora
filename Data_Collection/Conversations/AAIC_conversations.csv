"selling at a discount to tangible book value, interest rates are normalizing, have a big position will add at this price."
Had my eye on this before the crash....wondering if the dividend will stay or change now
"Last month I asked if it would hold $6. This month, I'm asking if it will hold $5. There's a pattern here....."
1.58% AH drop. I suspect folks are fearful of yet another dividend cut. Most of the past years have seen the Announcement at about this time and the fact that it is delayed is not reassuring. Ken
"The ""big boys"" ALWAYS have access to information you and I never will.The hedge funds are buying it.The corporate officers are buying. Yet, still no common dividend, and the revenue news is awful. The highest ratings I'm seeing are HOLD. OK, so why are the hedge funds committing OPM to it? Why are the officers buying? What do they know that we don't?"
AAIC is rated the worst in a recent study!Really?
"It's a beautiful day down on the floor of the NYSE. The DOW is up another 150 points and bounced back another 500 points yesterday afternoon. BUT WAIT - WHAT'S THIS? You mean to say that while the entire market was skyrocketing for thousands of companies (and their investors) our little Arlington Asset Investment got taken to the woodshed and IS DOWN BIG AGAIN THIS MORNING? HUH? WHAT'S THAT? Management says - ignore what I'm saying about Q2, we had a good July. But an analyst on the call then asks: so how is August looking, Rock? Oooops....here we go again. TIME TO CALL THE COPS! ""We was robbed!"""
The ineptitude of this company’s management is amazing. Their inability to thrive in a good economy speaks volumes. I will be selling when I have use for the write off. I’ve had this in my portfolio since before the meltdown in 2008. Experienced the 1 for 20 reverse split 10 years ago and multiple dividend reductions since. I should have unloaded my position years ago.
"Well, congrats on a good quarter. Surely long overdue. So here’s the question: is it sustainable? Surely the trend line suggests that it is not. And this begs another question: what REALLY happened this quarter that stood in STARK CONTRAST to prior quarters? Perhaps a little window dressing to help float that $750M shelf registration? Someone suggested a DIV bump was now in the cards. No way, Jose. If you strung together 4 consecutive quarters at $.72 each, the current DIV would still be too high at a 40% payout! So here’s the bottom line: Nice quarter. Other than that, nothing has changed. With the bump in the stock price today, it is now a shorty’s delight!"
Consistently pays a dividend yield of $.55 (19%) quarterly!
"Lot of shorts out there; 7% or 1.8 M. They will need to buy before xdiv; make em pay up! Even if you want to sell before xdiv, wait till Monday afternoon; you'll get a better price. I bought for the dividend run myself, but I liked the QR and think it's too cheap to let go of. Yield of 19% is great in a reit and I think they can continue it. Also BV is in the $13's; won't stay cheap for long."
"I have owned bad stocks, but nothing close to this stock. With the DOW up 226 points today and this pos down 3.48%, I realized that I am not ever going to get my money back. I just sold this #$%$ and and have learned to be cautious of dividend traps. This company is the worst of the worst. Good riddance!!"
fortunately I have 80 July 20 10 strike put contracts to balance the big loss tomorrow stock could go sub 8
Could $AI be planning to reinstate common dividend?
up almost 4%. While that is nice I see no recent news to account for it. Anyone have a clue or a guess?
"Relax. The dividend for the common shares will be announced in about another week or so. Look on the bright side, the B shares dividend went from .23 up to .43."
I’m sorry but management is being fraudulent by not responding to this downward spiral with no news!!! Disgusting.
Dan. Makes perfect sense. I think Pete’s point is - why here / why now? Question: can this investigation cause the company to liquidate us at or near BV (around 5.75 / share) minus the extortion of $10 million that we will have to management (which is over10% of market cap). I think we should all contact this Zamansky firm and vent our frustrations!!!
This company does not earn any income Over the last 12 months it lost $2 per share and yet it pad distribution of $1.50 per shareIt keeps selling new shares to pay distribution Like a Ponzi scheme Someday in the next five years it may go out of business I sold my shares
Year ago close....$11.27. Accumulated dividends since then.....$1.50. Today....will it hold $7? But isn't the dividend great!?
Does the MoronsTribeTroll have covered yet? I hope not !!!
Not to be an alarmist but today's action suggests a lot of folks rushing for the exit before dividend decrease. I'm hopeful that it is just an over reaction as other REITs are also doing poorly (look at APTS). We'll know next week I imagine. GLLKenKen
Everyone...you're weeks behind. Do your DD. Your options are almost over to recoup your investments. Think about what's happened over the past few weeks!
Tomorrow is ex div so in theory it should open 22.5 cents lower or $6.525. Any close above that number will be a positive sign. Assuming my arithmetic is correct.
"I've been trying to put a number on value for AI. It's starting to look like the dividend can be sustained; and, lately, they even seem to be increasing BV, in spite of a tough rate environment. How? I suspect they've learned how to hedge this environment. If I could be certain their performance would remain this good, long term, I could see it in the $20's in a few quarters. Last quarter it reached the mid $12's; now, with another good quarter, even a little better actually, I think we break $13 after the dividend is announced."
Who sell 250000 shares of a 20% dividend stock BEFORE the distribution. No one in their right mind.Sometimes I think the big guys manipulate the market so much that individuals don't stand a chance. Driving down the price so they can buy cheap and collect the dividend. It's nothing for them to sell 250000 shares when their holding millions of shares and will get a .55 dividend.
Looks like the Artificial Intelligence bots were finally reprogrammed to ignore us.
"Apparently, that is what everyone was waiting to hear, that is awesome, maybe we get back to the 13's soon."
There are institutions who don't hold shares under $10. May have a reverse split. AI would get more interest if it paid Div monthly.
"The Company's Board of Directors determined not to declare a dividend on its common stock for the second quarter of 2021. The Company's Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the payment of quarterly dividends based on multiple factors including current financial results, overall market conditions, return opportunities on investments, liquidity needs and REIT distribution requirements. No definitive determination has been made at this time regarding the declaration of future dividends.Second Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights$0.24 per diluted common share of GAAP net loss$0.07 per diluted common share of non-GAAP core operating income$5.94 per common share of book value2.2 to 1 ""at risk"" leverage ratio0.9 million shares of common stock repurchased, or 2.6% of outstanding common stock at an average price of $4.06 per share ---> spent approximately $3,654,000 on buybacks."
"AI sold off 9% following the call today. So much for what was left in the buyback pool. I was shocked, quite frankly, as I was unaware that they had already bought back a million shares at around $3. I’m guessing that everyone else was too and that’s why it sold off so much. So why weren’t you buying at $1.40 Rock? And where’s that new authorization on a day you know you’re going into the tank???Hockeyzan is so correct. Option 3 - liquidate the company!!!"
"I can breath easier now that the $.55 has been declared. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see an increase.Ken"
Dividend incoming - end of year they HAVE to make a distribution to meet the requirements... it makes sense
"no dividend common stock, vote them out"
Hmmm...maybe they'll pay a dividend in 2021?
"Here’s a thought for all you happy investors - AI, often mistaken as a tech stock, is at its post-pandemic high even though REITS are out of favor. The tyranny of the quarterly call is just weeks away (although they try to hide that from you). So are you ready for this. (trumpets) - to insure that they have enough cash to keep paying outrageous comp, it’s time to dust off that shelf registration and raise some cash!! That’s right. To hell with the suckers who bought this stock at 10,20,30.... they need to keep the candy store shelves stocked with cash. I figure they can fetch at $2 a share from some fresh meat! No worries.... it’s highly dilutive but not fatal."
Stonegate Capital Partners Initiates Coverage on Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE: AI)https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stonegate-capital-partners-initiates-coverage-213000967.html
"Well, based upon this price action, two things are apparent:- Arlington’s greatest asset, now gone, was it’s AI ticker which it used to confuse investors that it was something more than a piggy bank for management to drain, and- the market expects a poor quarterly call, whenever Rock finally decides to hold it. DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICKKABOOM "
"Couple of observation for this Board:- for those wondering about the four digit quotes - that’s what happens below $5 (sub penny quotes). This is the equivalent of being put on oxygen!- Nice August AI Management/Board- we only lost 30% of our value (or roughly $75 million in market cap) this month. - while we only lost 2 cents today, we got as low as $4.79 before the shorties covered their positions ahead of the long weekend. All and and all - CLAW BACK AND LIQUIDATE, CLAW BACK AND LIQUIDATE, CLAW BACK AND LIQUIDATE, CLAW BACK AND LIQUIDATE, Say it with me now - CLAW BACK AND LIQUIDATE, CLAW BACK AND LIQUIDATE...."
Earnings out. Better than I had feared. Will be interested to see how they spin it t the CC tomorrow.Ken
modest ouch
when will we know about the dividend for March should we be told one way or another
Reduced distribution but at least it hasn't been cut this last quarter. Pretty decent earnings. Up a bit in AH. I don't really expect to see this trading a whole lot higher over the coming year but as long as the distribution doesn't get cut again I'm happy with a 20% yield. Of course their coverage ratio is pretty tight just about 1.0 meaning they have very little margin for error. I would really like to see the FFO at $2.50 or more.
Earnings call was another joke. Told us nothing other than buyback bought 2+ million shares. Never addressed that big chunk of earnings was a gain on ticker sale. Total of 3 lame questions from analysts. What a waste. The game of hide the ball continues DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICKKABOOM!!
Time to demand a cut in management salaries.
"I have not checked my Fidelity acct for years! My 27500 shares of AAIC has lost $395,419.04 or 79.52% with an average cost basis of $18.08! Such a deal!"
"Happy Palm Sunday to all. Question: AI is now on the clock in terms of their quarterly earnings call. Will/can they find a white knight before they are forced to confess their sins? The govt isn’t going to bail them out. The only chance to survive is to be acquired, in my humble opinion."
AI is up 6.96% to 10.91
"Oh the weather outside is frightfulBut the DOW is so delightfulAnd since AI just can’t growLet it go, Let it go, Let it go!It doesn’t show signs of profitAnd management just ain’t got it The stock price is way down lowLet it go, Let it go, Let it goMr Wolf and all the LongsJust hate these kinds of songsSince AI just can’t growLet it go, Let it go, Let it goMerry Christmas Tick, tick, tickDrip drip drip!"
"These guys lose money almost every quarter, and the market is so uncomfortable with them that their price to book ratio is less than one. I see nothing that makes me think that investing wit these guys makes sense. Given the salaries involved, they are doing an excellent job of converting investors capital into their capital."
"good question. why are they sliding? it is about time AI took aturnaround and started climbing again. agree that the managementis out of line taking a large bonus in the ""incentive plan"" when it isan obvous bust. it has not performed. they have not performed. theyowe us something for this bad business. they need to raise the diviand the stock needs to start climbing again or it can only be called abust."
"I predicted it might be cut though I expected it to be .57 or higher. But .55 is just fine; it is far more sustainable and will prevent the leakage in BV we have seen. After, perhaps, a knee jerk, I expect the SP to go higher. Most stocks paying .55/q and up are in the $17's at least, and are at least as risky as AI. SXCP for example. Or consider NRZ; a good company, no doubt, but paying only .48/q and in the $16's. This dividend adjustment makes AI much less risky, IMO."
Two things guys:- TIMBERRRRR...look at that steady drip drip drip down down down all day. Looks like a downward staircase. So:- where’s the Buyback?? And- Maybe Zamansky filed the litigation to liquidate the company??Second item: I am putting MegaCrackHead on mute and encourage you to do same!
"Wow, apparently my timing for trying this REIT out really stunk, it has been down every day since I bought and its going into ex-div tomorrow. I sure hope James is right about the price accelerating through ex-div, though I doubt it."
"What's going on ? Stock closed at $ 9.03/s, book value is $ 10.56/s. Total cash is $ 4.08B and total debt is $ 3.83B. Can anyone explain this ?"
"Question: is the unusually early call due to: A. - good news for shareholders, or. B. - convenient for management’s August vacation schedule. Upon further reflection, I think it might be B!!!!"
Hmmm. More investor confusion per Tom’s post! Perhaps time to call the SEC??? How long must investors be misled???
"Arlington Asset Investment Corp. Declares Second Quarter 2020 Dividends on Preferred Stock and Provides Update on Common Stock Dividend.Well, perhaps after a few quarters paying only the preferred we'll see a small dividend for us poor bag holders with common shares. I'm not holding my breath, mind you, but it would be nice."
"anybody please post, when is divi for common share"
"One would think that after posting up that disaster quarter and given the uncertainty of the pandemic, AI would simply liquidate itself (as suggested by the first analyst on the call) ? Nope. Management just can’t shut down their candy store and massive comp. “let’s just keep screwing the shareholders until we RUN OUT OF THEIR MONEY!”. Time to bring in the lawyers!"
book value is around $7. why the low SP?
"Question: in addition to the multi-million $ comp packages (to include a guy who just retired with a massive advisor contract) , why does a teeny weeny little company like ours require the most expensive HQ in Arlington. Replete with a spectacular view of the WH, Capital, Lincoln and Jefferson Monuments, the AI offices are phenomenal. This has to be the most self-serving mgt in America. Is such elegance essential to our success? Hell no! Their attitude toward shareholders is “let them eat cake”. Time to end the shareholder abuse!"
Market up 3%. AI up 22%. I smell a deal.
"Div announced $.55, xdiv Mar 28, pays Apr 30. Got hit in mkt today out of ignorance.MLP's were hit due to changes in tax treatment. They got hit hard and it spread to other sectors. I said it would not be cut."
Arlington Asset Investment Corp. Declares Dividend on its Series B Preferred Stock for the First Quarter of 2018https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/pr-newswire-arlington-asset-investment-corp-declares-dividend-on-its-series-b-preferred-stock-for-the-first-quarter-of-2018.html
Not surprised just disappointed and screwed. Every since I paid way too much for this stock the dividends have gone down down down.
Earnings per share $0.82 and payout $2.50. How?
"It is not worthy to buy stocks to earn dividends because stock price dropped, you would lose more than what dividends paying. You actually paying their dividends. They end up re-purchasing their shares at lower prices. I said good bye to these scam stocks. Bought $10.1 and sold $9.6 in disgust!"
"Happy Labor Day to my fellow AI investors. I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that AI will not decline any further this beautiful sunny Monday. The bad news is that trading will resume in the morning. Please take this holiday free time to get your letters off to the SEC, NYSE, and the investor law firms!!! Five year clawback and Liquidation."
"The technicals look very bearish for AI. It shows a ""head n shoulders"" over last quarter, and it's in a long term downtrend. Still; performance seems to be improving, though it takes time to overcome such bearish indicators. On a technical basis it needs to retest the lows and demonstrate support higher than before. Fundamentally, it needs to show continued steady improvement in dcf w/o giving up BV. I think it goes into the $10's; hopefully it doesn't go as low as the high $9's as before. If it shows strong support in the mid $10's or higher; then likely we get to the $12's in the next xdiv cycle."
"Finally some positive momentum, hopefully it can get back to the 13 range again. The dividend is nice though."
AI is down 19.07% to 1.74
Div cut to .375! I tried to warn you guys but you didn't like what I said.
"I’m new to stocks; so when I saw the price drop significantly I got a little worried, but I did more research and found out that it’s normal for the price to drop on ex div day. My 2 questions are: can AI recover and go back to the high 11’s and even hopefully the 12’s? Do investors typically buy more of the stocks knowing that the price goes way down?Thank you guys for any feedback"
any opinions on recent earnings report? I'd call it good but not great. We need 2 more good reports and we need to see an increase in the cash available for distribution.
Up three day in a row on better than average volume. I could get used to this. I need a double from here to get back even. I would need more than a triple to get even if I hadn't been reinvesting dividends all these years.
Down day in the market and Arlington is the star performer in my portfolio so far. I honestly cant remember the last time this happened. Maybe they're finally bouncing off the bottom?
"Yo, mistake on da lake...keep your shares and contact Zamansky!"
"MCLEAN, Va., March 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE: AI) (the ""Company"") today announced that the Company has determined not to declare a first quarter 2020 common stock dividend in order to preserve liquidity as a result of volatile market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic."
Pure manipulation.
"Earnings today, fingers crossed we have a market with positive momentum by then an a good report from AI. Love the dividend. I'd hate to bail. GL"
"Hello shorts, how is it going? How many seconds to earnings? how many cents does AI have lost during the last 2.4789 seconds?This is what I call a nice SQEEEEZE but what's even better is it's not finished yet. tick tack etc. etc."
"Question for the board - Anonymous posted ""Arlington Asset Investment BV rises in July; shares jump 8.1%"". That information was fed to Anonymous by the company prematurely disclosing part of their third quarter performance (July) in their 2Q press release. It smells as a deceptive tactic that says 'Don't focus on our 2Q disaster (that took the stock down below $6) but rather that we losing less money in the first month of the third quarter. I find that to be materially misleading and improper disclosure that is not protected by safe harbor. Do you agree with me that it is time for lawyers to take a closer look at this charade perpetrated by two guys who rape the shareholders at every turn? Where is the SEC? Where is the NYSE? Where are the investor activists? Time to ""liquidate and claw back""! Yea or nay?"
"Changing ticker from ""AI"" to ""AAIC""....with no explanation why. There are costs in doing so. Trying to hide past?"
Just read on Seeking Alpha that Arlington has filed a prospectus for a 750M mixed shelf offering.It's the only place I've seen this info so far.
So....is everybody loading up?
"I said AI is no more risky than NRZ. Look at NRZ now and read the news, and you will see what I mean."
"Ed. Love you man. My sentiments exactly.Pretty amazing that some people just can’t accept the fact that the Emperor has no cloths. Fake earnings, phony dividend, multi-million $ mgt comp, years of negative slope stock price, etc. Only you, me and a handful of others called it what it is - a candy store for former FBR execs who drove that great company into the ground as well. Sad! And they criticize me for being negative/honest! Time for a shot gun marriage or a liquidation!! Bring in the lawyers."
Halloween joke: How is Arlington Asset like a submarine? A: they both DIVE DIVE DIVE!Nice price action post ticker sale Rock. We look forward to hearing more details (and phony strategy) on the call. Sure would be nice if you gave us more than 20 seconds notice in advance of the call!DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICKKABOOM!!

"Arlington Asset Investment BV rises in July; shares jump 8.1%Aug. 6, 2019 5:45 PM ET|About: Arlington Asset Investment ...

I think Everyone would feel better about this stock if it could hold its stock price. It not and the Board needs to be paid based on performance. I think they need to show stock holders they have skin in the game. they need to set up a target price above where we are at today with at least a 5 to 10 percent increase per quarter.
Is Stonegate Capital Research conflicted?
Has anyone been around long enough to explain the massive decline from 2003 to 2008?
Will I ever get above water? Jeez.
"Heads up: AAIC announces on a Friday night that it wii release earnings on election night with the call the next morning. Geez, could they be any more obvious that they are trying to hide the ball?"
I have owned this for year but now is a great buying opportunity. I only buy when something is on sale. See Citibank in 2008 when I bought it for $1.00.
Yep going to be a bad day tomorrow
Helluva pop this AM thanks to one of best quarterly earnings in a long time. I doubt we'll see the share price climb to levels of past years but at least for the time being it appears that the already much reduced dividend is secure. Ken
Guys. This is the second time in two days that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) message has been posted to this Board. Clearly there is investor confusion as Arlington Asset Investment is in the REIT business! Please change our ticker to AAI.
Sure looks like market manipulation to me! Time to call the lawyers. Let the investigations begin!!!
Arlington Asset is up 4.96% to 2.75
Book value has clearly/likely climbed 5-10 pct in recent weeks.
Looks like all of you experts are left holding the bag! My 300k shares will be fully reimbursed @$25.00/sh.!
"How can thestreet give this stock a C rating, when most are down on it. what do they see? Can anyone explain?"
"No dividend cut as many feared based on 4Q despite statement of recovery in January.1.50 / 8.50 = 17.65% yield.1.50 / 16% = price of 9.375IMO, nice pop tomorrow."
I believe the past few December dividend announcements have come around 17-20th so w should hear something at the end of this week or early next week. fingers crossed. If the dividend is maintained I can see a nice pop. GLLKen
AI is up 19.43% to 2.09
"Love the commentary by those ""expert"" types....from Simply Wall Street:""The general public holds a substantial 59% stake in Arlington Asset Investment, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.""Ok, all you public investors, start swaying the key decisions!!"
Is AI cutting its dividend???
Question for the Board. Thinking more about Ed’s point on the buyback. Is the failure to make adequate disclosure about the buyback a breach of fiduciary responsibility or grounds for the SEC and plaintiffs bar to get involved???
"As promised, I called the Zamansky offices this afternoon. They appear to have two pretty high-powered attorneys on the AI case. This is good. Some of you have likely had an impact as he told me that they received several calls and have several people signed. Congrats to those of you have stepped up. For those who have, please do it. This is the best shot we’ve ever had at some shareholder justice!"
"Interesting. Mindi McClure was nominated as an ""independent director"". Guess where she worked from 1991 - 2005? With FBR. If you don't know, FBR used to be AI, for all intents and purposes. I'd guess some of the old guys in AI said...hey, we know her, let's get her on the board!"
Article from Zacks is typical bs. They are correct about the PE being a bit high; but they don't explain that it could be improving.
the trick here is long term reinvestment of dividends. most people don't do it.
"The Executive Compensation table for 2017 shows Eric F. Billings, the Executive Chairman receiving $3,072,617 in Incentive Plan, Stock Awards and other compensation. Likewise, J.Rock Tonkel, Jr., Chief Executive Officer and President received $3,072,438. My question is with the dividend being cut from .55 to .375 per sh/quarter, and the stock price falling into the mid tens, how does management justify their large compensation? Also there is $139.00 of cash per share, a very very large amount of funds for this C Corporation to be holding, Why can't management award some of these funds to the deserving shareholders instead of awarding themselves with increasingly high compensations?Value1"
"Anyone think if this is a good buy ? 17% dividend yield looks very high, is there a reducing coming?"
It's time to start reducing executive compensation. I don't reward failure. I punish it.
How about a liquidation?
"Hmm, up 20+% on heavy volume. Could it be.....that at long last they’ve found a merger partner? God, let’s hope so!!!!"
On Friday Ford Equity Research upgraded from hold to buy saying AI is undervalued. Others have a hold or neutral.
"Question: Since AI has not been paying ""real"" dividends, but returning capital over the years.....what happens if/when your share goes negative?? For example, say you bought now at $8.xx, and over the next six years they continue to pay out (apparently, out of capital), $.375 per quarter or $1.50 a year....do you now have ""negative capital""? So if you sell, how would that be handled via taxes?"
I will hold my shares just to vote out all board members.
"I own 20 call contracts at SP $12.50. After reviewing chart I have decided to execute them and take the big dividends. Yeah, it may get hit on xdiv, but in the past it recovers in a few days. This is really too cheap for this stock, with BV over $16, and huge yield of 17%. It fell from the $15's, due to confusion with another company's div announcement."
DRIP purchased at $10.50Posted February 1
"I don't see an announced earnings date, just a range."
Waiting patiently for my massive dividend to get applied. Sweet!
"Deja Vu?Hi Longs and Mr. Wolf. How’s it going? I hope you enjoyed that stellar 3Q “LOSSES” release that AI just put out. Now that the 3Q results are in, you can apologize for your name-calling, false information and myopic viewpoint by simply replying that “BTG IS THE KING OF THE BOARD “!Think not? Just read the following that I copied from last quarter then read this quarter. Same old BS. In fact it’s deja vu and the jokes on you LONGS!!!2Q release: ""During the second quarter, increased prepayment speed expectations and a continued flat interest rate curve reduced returns on levered agency mortgage-backed security (""MBS"") investments,"" said J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Given that environment, the Company improved its risk profile by lowering its recourse financing to investable capital leverage to 9.1x as of June 30, 2019. The Company also shifted more of its agency MBS investment portfolio exposure towards lower coupon securities that carry lower premiums as well as reduced prepayment risk, and the Company has continued that process in the third quarter. In that context, the Company lowered its quarterly dividend to approximate its core operating income per common share. To the extent that current market expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts materialize, future investment returns on levered agency MBS may improve, benefitting the Company's earnings profile. Finally, while agency MBS spreads have widened somewhat in early August, spread tightening during July increased the Company's book value to approximately $8.10 per common share as of July 31, 2019.""”."
Can someone explain me the profit margin of -190%? thank you :)
Anything below $11.55 is a huge buying opportunity in my experienced opinion.
hold and buy more?
Don’t get too excited guys. It’s just the shorties covering this morning before an August weekend. Keep pushing “Liquidation and 5 year clawback of unearned management comp” !!!
"PURCHASED RESEARCH Danger, danger Will Robinson!

I am averaging down today. I see target has been reduced. I have faith in the management of this REIT. They are 100% agency backed now and in the Q & A they said the 2nd Quarter will adjust to the environment. Must admit it is my gut feeling of management.
sold all yesterday !
Question for the Board: Has anyone sent their letter to the SEC / NYSE yet? I drafted mine and am still editing it.Stock is down BIG again this morning? Hovering near all time low. Time for “Liquidation and five year claw back of management comp” !!!
"Hell raiser. You’re on the wrong ticker here because you are referencing “AI” which is the ticker for “Arlington Asset Investment”. Yes, we should definitely change our ticker to “AAI”. But in the meantime, know that your post is incorrect."
"Has anyone read the article ""Is Arlington Asset Investment Corp.a good stock to buy ? ""Is it factual ?"
dividend is more than any interest you can make from banks
1.1 million shares traded something big going on or coming.
Technical indicators say buy.
Dear Arlington Asset Investment- please move to the AAI ticker ASAP! Your AI ticker is causing you to be lumped in with robots rather than reits!!!!
Arlington Asset Inv is up 5.87% to 3.97
Management needs to buy some shares.
"When I finally saw the light and sold my AI, I put the $$ in NRZ; no regrets. NRZ yield is about 11% and it's reliable! I got a dividend, and about 10% in cap gain. Also; digging into it I discover that NRZ is expected to raise their dividend soon because earnings have increased a lot since their last increase."
Vote out all board members.
"Fast Eddie is correct again. “They” effectively own this company! The deck is stacked and you will never vote them out as this is nothing more than a Candy Store for Rock and the small, tight circle of FBR BANDITS.Only hope - liquidate via litigation or a forced sale!!"
"Guys, My collective response to multiple posts:- Tho, Mr Ed is correct. There was never any quarterly dividend. It was a return of capital as the company never had “earnings” upon which to distribute a dividend!- Mr. Ed, thanks for keeping the board focused on the facts!- Tho, too little too late on your purchase. Board is locked in until next spring. - Danny Boy, AI’s administration of the buyback (like much of what they do and don’t do in terms of disclosure) violets SEC rules (see Skadden Arps post). Bring on the lawyers. All - amazing what you can learn by simply reading the Q. Stuff like:- did you know that Arlington Asset isn’t really in Arlington anymore! They moved to McLean Va. wow. I didn’t know that! Perhaps they should change their name. This one is pretty beat up!- did you know that they share office space with Rock Creek Capital? Perhaps a sub? I didn’t know that either!- did you know they made no reference to the new buyback authorization that Rock referenced on the call. Ha. They still had 800,000 left on the old one!!! All for now. Time to liquidate this pig!DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICKKABOOM!!!"
Has anyone tried to contact Zamansky yet? I’m going to call tomorrow even though it’s a holiday. Will keep the board apprised.I think we should all flood Zamansky with calls and emails. This is kind of exciting after so many years of being treated like a mushroom 
"Interesting earnings report; loss of .20 per share; book value fell by 3%; no dividend.But....""With regard to its REIT requirements, the company does have the flexibility to utilize its tax loss carryforwards to reduce its taxable income and annual distribution requirements. The company will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of its common stock at accretive prices.""Do people buy mREITs to get a return of capital via share buybacks??"
No dividend likely at this point because I don 't believe they had any actual earnings. A REIT must pay out 90% of earnings.
"Hmmmm, I smell a takeout of AI. Why? Two reasons:- It’s pretty clear that AI management is hopeless and helpless and have no chance of being truly profitable but more importantly - Board Member Anthony Nader just joined the Board of Federal Realty Trust (a $6 Billion Market Cap REIT).This is a no-brainer. And, as unfair and outrageous as this may be, AI has change in control provisions in their contracts that will yield them MILLIONS personally. Once again, WE THE SHAREHOLDERS GET PAID ONLY AFTER MANAGEMENT HAS ROBBED THE BANK!"
"So what does it say about Stonegate that AI has fallen to another all time low immediately following their report? It says we don’t believe them! The stock has fallen by more than 50% since August, 2018 - costing shareholders almost $200 million while the top two guys are draining cash out of over $100K per week!And the Board is sound asleep!!"
Up 3.5% today.What news did I miss?
Curious how the new tax code will impact Arlington. Any thoughts??
"Wow up almost 10% on big volume. always a strong positive sign. However, IMHO the only thing that will cause a sustained price appreciation will be an increase in the dividend."
Earnings out and they are OK. Quick summary: blah blah blah no dividends for commoners!
"Well...I asked in July if it would hold $6, this month, I asked if it would hold $5.....maybe I shouldn't ask anymore...."
"Why isn't This Fund Holding its price, It pays a great dividend but can't hold its Stock Price. Can someone Explain?"
"Arlington Asset Investment -1.6% after Q3 miss, may consider REIT structureOct. 23, 2018 5:11 PM ET|About: Arlington Asset Investment ... (AI)|By: Liz Kiesche, SA News Editor Arlington Asset Investment (NYSE:AI) sags 1.6% in after-hours trading after Q3 non-GAAP core operating income of 47 cents per share falls short of consensus estimate of 53 cents; compares with 59 cents in Q2.Evaluating possible long-term tax structures, including potentially electing to be taxed as a REIT as early as Jan. 1, 2019, citing expectation that the company will fully utilize its net operating loss carryforward during 2019.As of Sept. 30, 2018, agency MBS investment portfolio totaled $5.18B in fair value, consisting of $4.40B of specified agency MBS and $781M of net long to-be-announced agency MBS.Book value per common share $9.95 at Sept. 30, 2018 vs.$10.52 at June 30, 2018.If it elects REIT status, book value would be equivalent to its tangible book value per share of $11.06.Q3 economic net interest income of $17.2M vs. $20.1M in Q2.Previously: Arlington Asset Investment misses by $0.06, misses on revenue"
@Cleve et. al.I’ve been hit with the idea that any number of people are investing in stocks based on some technical formula without any idea of the company they’re investing in. It’s business. It’s challenges. Management. etc. See the green light & buy.It would explain why some think this an artificial intelligence company.Don’t quite know what to make of my insight.Your opinion?
"Five years ago it was at $20 per share. But they had that large ""dividend"" (aka, return of capital). Isn't professional management of money great!"
"Good eye Mr Ed. I just checked the Form 4’s. Both CEO & CFO bought 20k more each in last week of Sept.Not sure if the buyback or the CEO/CFO are buying, but it sure smells like the Zamansky investigation has got their attention. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire!!"
Anyone think the #$%$ of a stock is every going to pay a dividend again? I'm a split second from dumping it and taking the lost on my taxes in order to get into anything better!
"Edward, Steve, et alAre we going to take this just lying down? We gotta fight back. Has anyone contacted an attorney yet to investigate this obvious conversion scam?"
Downgraded by Maxim this morning.
$.55/share Dividend Declared!!!
Earnings look positive. Tomorrow should be exciting
SP adjusting for dividend which get applied today.
"Thomas, one can only speculate. AI lost 67 cents per share and paid out 22 cents in phony dividends (real dividends are paid out of earnings not losses!) in Q2. Hence, AI just burned through 89 cents of equity. Using,then, the most current quarter as a proxy and at a stock price of $5.70 or so, the company will be BK by the end of next year. This is precisely why I have endeavored to inspire this board to “Liquidate and claw back 5 years of undue management enrichment” ! We need to act now before it’s too late. Please join me in raising our voices on this atrocity!"
"I noted a comment that buying under book value is smart. Totally WRONG. Ever asked yourself why anyone would TRADE below BV? Simple - GAAP BV is a false measure of the discounted future earnings!!And even accepting your thesis, 4.06 is a joke. They are merely pumping their own stock at the expense of shareholders.Time to Investigate!"
"Same distribution. Price down 5% on heavy volume, very strange price action."
Is anybody having an issues receiving the dividend payout?
"X-Day December 27th, chance to buy in sub $12.00, am hoping anyway. With the yield at over 17% should be a positive going forward. LOL!"
I bought this today to vote the officers out unless they re-instate the dividends for the quarterly common stock investors.
"Danny Boy, Mr Ed, et al. You inquired about buyback disclosure requirements. I think AI’s got a MAJOR PROBLEM. Per Skadden Arps the following is required: Should a company publicly disclose its share repurchase program?Yes. In order to avoid potential liability for insider trading in connection with a share repurchase program, a company should publicly disclose the program prior to its commencement. Because the extent of the required public disclosure depends on the facts specific to the share repurchase program, disclosure should be made after consultation with counsel. At a minimum, disclosure should be made with enough time to allow the market to absorb the announcement and include the following information: the estimated time period during which the purchases will be made; the maximum number of shares proposed to be acquired or the maximum amount of funds to be expended; the objective of the acquisition of shares; any plan or proposal relating to the disposition of the shares to be purchased; and an indication of how the purchases will be made. The disclosure may be made in a Form 10-Q or 10-K, or by means of a press release or Form 8-K, depending upon timing of the approval and commencement of the program. The company also should issue a public announcement disclosing any material modifications to a share repurchase program (and should announce any increase in the size of the program). Is a company subject to any reporting requirements in connection with its repurchase program?Yes. Item 703 of Regulation S-K requires that, for all issuer repurchases of equity securities (whether an open market or private transaction), the company must disclose in its next periodic report the following information, in tabular form, for each month of the preceding fiscal quarter:4 the total number of shares purchased; the average price paid per share; the number of shares purchased as part of a publicly announced program; and the maximum number of shares (or approximate dollar value) that may yet be repurchased under the program. Additionally, for publicly announced programs, the SEC requires disclosure (in footnotes to the table) of the following information: the date of the announcement; the share or dollar amount approved by the board of directors; the expiration date (if any) of the program; each program that has expired during the last fiscal quarter; and each program that the issuer has determined to terminate prior to expiration or under which the issuer does not intend to make further purchases. Companies generally also include disclosure in the liquidity and capital resource section of their “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in their annual and quarterly reports"

Hey we go again....an Artificial Intelligence post.... with six upvotes.
"I will hold for a while, Div is not bad, although in the hole a little"
"Hmmm...announced offering of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2026, while calling 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023. Maybe they're trying?"
"Big fall today with the overall market. It was not enough to break it's uptrend. Still several weeks till they announce the dividend; so there's time for the traders to play with it. It may retest the most recent low; but maybe not since their last report was very good. Of course, a bear raid is always possible. I will hold for the dividend but maybe buy more if it dips below my cost basis."
Impressive beat; shows they have learned how to hedge this rate environment. I think they keep the dividend at $.55. Two quarters of good performance in a very tough rate environment will get some attention; good chance we get back to the $13's. Gotta admit I was negative on AI before report. Wish I'd jumped in big yesterday.
"YOU WERE PUT ON NOTICE / Highlights of my recent posts:- I think it’s more likely that they are scrambling to cover their margin calls. - PURCHASED RESEARCH Danger, danger Will Robinson! Beware - Conflict of Interest.- Woooo LOOK OUT BELOWAI has now lost all of its gains since early Feb despite having its best quarter in a very long time.

They’re smiling all the way to the bank and are likely doubling down right now.Crazy posted: “shorts are getting killed”. I posted: Well, yes and no. Recent shorts, most likely.

Surely the trend line suggests that it is not. And this begs another question: what REALLY happened this quarter that stood in STARK CONTRAST to prior quarters? Perhaps a little window dressing to help float that $750M shelf registration? Someone suggested a DIV bump was now in the cards. No way, Jose. If you strung together 4 consecutive quarters at $.72 each, the current DIV would still be too high at a 40% payout! SO HERE WE SIT JUST A TAD ABOVE $3 with a dividend yield about 30% while losing money hand over fist. Time to call in the lawyers, the SEC, the cops.... what a mucking fess this company is. Will someone please pull the plug!!!"
Well that was a short rally. At least we'll get the dividend this quarter.Ken
"Arlington Asset Investment (AI) shed 6% in recent pre-market trade after it said late Thursday that its board had approved a 32% cut in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 per common share from $0.55.The dividend will be paid on July 31 to common shareholders of record on June 29.Price: 11.32, Change: +0.04, Percent Change: +0.35"
"no dividend on common stock, vote them out"
"No investor confusion here, right?"
"""Arlington Asset Investment Corp. Declares $0.875 per Share Dividend for the First Quarter of 2014"" ....the good ole days"
Just sold some @ 5.60 today in advance of the tyranny of the 3Q results and imminent dividend cut. I expect to recapture my losses when we settle with management.
"""Turning to our actual results for the quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $0.52 per share and core operating income of $0.32 per share. "" ---From their earnings call.Gee, I'm almost impressed. If they can keep this up, they could actually fund their dividend and have money to invest."
Has dividend for common stock been announced?
AI at 20% dividend is a GIFT !!!
"IMHO AI is a buy, great dividend and trading at 84 cents on the dollar. What is not to like."
"Just looking at the charts this morning. My my, what a pretty sight:2015 - $302017 - $18Today - $5Soon - $0Einstein - insanity = doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.Hence, we will soon be $0.I believe that in addition to the Management and Board, we have a claim against PWC for not issuing a “subject to a going concern” opinion!Agree or disagree?"
Bought some AI shares on November 6th 2019. but still have not received the dividend from December 30th 2019. Have you guys receiver your dividend / can you explain why I have not seen any so far? Thanks a lot in advance!
Closed out my position and moved funds to CBWTF. (Not that anyone cares :-) ). GLTA. This was a nice score.
"Update: per SeEC Form 4 filings, CEO just bought 100,000 shares and CFO bought 20,000 at 2.68. Hence, the movement up in the stock price.Now, if they then reinstalled the “fake dividend” that would be an enormous legal problem. In other words, they purchased stock via insider information. Thus, no dividend anytime soon!!"
I’m been moving in multiple directions for a couple of days. Any news on the investigation?
This POS just filed for a debt offering..Lock them up!!
i purchases AI preferred stock ai-pc today to vote out the board unless they re-instate thequarterly dividends for the common stock investors.
AI uses market-to-market. Book Value is $5.28. Now trading at 43% of book. I challenge anyone on this board to come up with ANY SINGLE REASON why this company should not be LIQUIDATED IMMEDIATELY!!!
Current dividend now down to $.90/yr at current share price of $6.45 is yield of 13or 14%. If they manage to maintain that dividend for 4 quarters ( not a guaranteed fact) then it is worth buying and holding until the next almost inevitable dividend cut. I think this company will cease to exist in a few more years.
Read ‘m and weep guys. The 2Q earnings release is out and the sea of red continues while the top two guys ripped another half million $$ ++ out of our pockets. Stock now trading at about 80% of book. Time to “Liquidate and claw back 5 years” of bogus comp. We need a Carl Icahn. Anybody got one????
Less than 5 hours to go before earnings are released an investors KNOW NOTHING other than propaganda from the AI industry. But that’s OK. Let the investors be confused by the AI ticker. Who cares about those guys. “Let them eat cake!”.
That the CEO gets any salary at all much less well over $1 million is really a sad commentary on the state of capitalism in America. Total incompetent executive in a company whose stock has plummeted and whose dividend as been suspended with no restoration in sight but still makes more than almost any of the employees or investors. My only consolation is that his stock options have plummeted also.
It’s been all down hill since that ridiculous rubber stamp virtual annual meeting on Monday. Stock down 25% this week.DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICKKABOOM!
"High dividend stocks are out of favor...interest rates going up....people are selling and buying bank stocks...everything I have that pays a dividend over 10% is getting hit...REITs, C Corps, MLP's etc....."
Welcome back. I hope that a great holiday was had by all. So yet again we face the cold reality of the quarterly earnings call and the never-ending deceit by the CIC (crooks in charge) to justify their massive comp. Would we not all be better off as shareholders if they were to liquidate AI for cash??
In light of the recent market carnage I'm happy to sit back and bank/DRIP my 20% dividend.It's nice to be able to relax as others panic. GL
When is dividend payment?
Stock up another 7% in pre-market? Shareholder meeting was a total rubber stamp joke. Told us NOTHING. The only way to get any answers is via an INVESTIGATION. Time for a class action investigation of the CIC via attorneys’!!
It's nice that I do not have to pay taxes on this dividend since AI is a C corp.
Dividend news incoming
if they aren't paying div. how are they going to consider themselves a reit?
Book value $8.70
Sub 6 and still falling. What’s it going to take for a “Liquidation and comp claw back”??? Carl Icahn - where are you?
Per article in Seeking Alpha - AI has lowest tangible price to book ratio of all Mreits. This might be a great time to buy.
"Pinot. My apologies for the slow reply. Your conclusion is absolutely correct. This company is a fraud - a payoff to former FBR execs (to include Eric Billings - the B in FBR - who received a million dollar consulting fee and has done no work for it) who do nothing but milk shareholders. This is a candy store. Everyone on this Board should be in touch with Zamansky if they ever want to see a dime of their investment. They are investigating the company and, I hope, will force its liquidation and return something near book value back to shareholders! That would roughly twice current market price.As I have written here many times:DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICKKABOOM! Call or email Zamansky!!!"
It should climb next week as probably Friday the divy will be announced for ex-date end of month.
Ed. Question for you as I have not yet researched this: how much NOL does AI have and are they carrying it as a deferred asset on their B/S?? This is a pretty important question at this perilous time.
"Do you get the feeling that they buy back shares just before earnings reports....so things don't seem so bad? What would concern me would be the almost 40% of non-agency ""mortgage credit investment strategies"" they have in their portfolio."
Why does this POS keep dropping?
"I must say I was wrong about the impact of the dividend cut. Share price has risen nicely since the announcement. Clearly many investors consider the current dividend, which while a cut is still very high, to be secure. Time will tell.Ken"
"people panic because of dividend cuts, and sell. Lets face it your here because the dividend pays more than a bank so why panic if your here long term"
Earnings out and they suck. Not super bad but hardly good. Needless to say I am not surprised. CAD barely covers the reduced dividend. Damn!!!Ken
Earnings report on Nov 3. Anything else going on that date that might distract folks?
Based on current price of $7.50 AI is paying a 20% dividend...……...
hopefully this stock will gain momentum soon. but still making it with dividends help so far
Stock continues to rise despite the negative input on this message board. I expect the stock to hit $12 this week.
Almost time to take position here.
Dividend Yield 19.26% you really think that is sustainable?
"I thought today was xdiv? Guess it's tomorrow? The market doesn't seem to like AI. I understand the chart looks bad; especially over last 5 years. And yes, they have a history of cutting the dividend. I hope things have improved but many are skeptical, with good reason. it may take another few quarters of stable performance to get the pps back over $12. I was wrong and probably wrong also in assuming it won't fall back under $10, after xdiv. I'll keep my small holding but I don't blame anyone for dumping."
"Wow! thanks to Stongate Capital; they told us the one good thing about AI; they lost so much money, they get a carry forward tax break. But; the bad news is: they have to actually earn $$ to make any use of it. We know that's not going to happen!"
Is nayone concerned about the recent double botton in AI?
loading up for long term. can't beat the price and it appears they now have a plan and it is working.
This company is being run for the benefit of management not share holders. Vote your shares to punish management and the board. fire them all.
Sorry for being MIA guys. I am still totally PO’d at this Den of Thieves who enrich themselves at shareholders expense while masquerading as a real company. Edward is so correct as usual. You have to make taxable profits to be subject to the distribution requirements. In the past these thieves would pay phony dividends from their losses where were simply a return of your capital (a fake dividend)!Anxious to see how much they’ve lost this quarter while using your capital to prop up the stock price and calling it accretive!!!
"no dividend, vote then out"
"As usual, Fast Eddie is correct with two small exceptions:- they moved to McLain to cut their rent and county taxes; and- while they closed out their higher risk non-agency positions, their business model is unsustainable. Their enormous comp (to include stock) for a group of less than a dozen people (plus a rubber stamp board of insiders) is greater than peers many times their size and who produce superior returns. They are thieves and belong in jail!"
This company is hanging on by a thread. I have written it off as a total loss in my plans although do hope that it can somehow survive and at some point resume paying a dividend. What nut case would buy it I cannot imagine.
Still my best paying dividend stock.
You will recall that they have a shelf registration out there. Hard to imagine that they would float shares down here - but desperation is a strange bedfellow!
Technical indicators flashing buy signals for AI. GLTA.
why is ai tanking today? they announced the earnings meeting not the earnings
"The important thing now, is how to play this profitably going forward. With the amount of volatility here, I think trading is better than buy and hold. Very important to not pay too much. I think tomorrow it will retest today's low. If it bounces off that low, maybe buy some? If it continues lower, watch for a bounce near $12; but wait for retest b4 buying. And so on. Don't buy too much until ER; if it's bad again, dump quick. If good, buy some but keep cash for more if there's another pullback. I know it's far more complex than this, but you get the idea."
"Once again good eye, Ed. For Crazy man and the other BTC haters here, I tried to warn you. Stevie Wonder could see this one coming. NO DIVIDEND. But the question now remaining is “why did mgt wait 10 days to disclose this while the price was doubling?”!! Here comes the law suits. And there’s more ugly disclosures in the AI press release: The Company has also provided the following updates. • The Company has satisfied all of its margin calls under its financing arrangements. • The Company estimates that its book value per common share as of March 24, 2020 has declined in a range of approximately 32% to 36% since December 31, 2019. • The Company de-levered its investment portfolio and estimates that its ""at risk"" short term secured financing to investable capital ratio has been reduced to approximately 1.6 to 1 from 8.7 to 1 as of December 31, 2019.[1] • The Company remains committed to preserving long-term value for its shareholders while also protecting its employees during this difficult time."

"Ralph. Where are you getting that from? Are you aware that Zamansky is investigating them??? When you pay dividends while losing money, that is not a dividend. It’s a return of capital. And, soon enough, you run out of cash!!!"
Now a more sensible stable divi...just keep the pps low while I can get a few more. Most of you see the glass half empty..sad.
I am holding 45000shares of aim at 5.65 I hope this goes up but I truly believe they lied about Japan and China they paid to be on proactive investor. China go aboard is a family run business with 5 people working they paid them no one heard of go aboard China in China I wrote this in other community from I got blocked
"BrownsTribeCavs mentioned a ""phony dividend"". The conference call did NOT mention ANY real estate transactions or earnings. It mentioned ONLY financial investment vehicles. Are they divesting themselves from real estate, and becoming a securities speculation operation? Insufficient info. If BrownsTribeCavs is right, this is a dying operation. I see nothing to contradict that guess."
has to regular dividend for end of June been declared?
It jumped to its daily high (up $.42) at 1:36. Rise was steep. Feels like a news leak. Maybe a deal??? Annual Shareholders Meeting (Virtual) on Monday.
"n 2018, qualified dividends and capital gains are subject to a 0% tax rate for taxable income up to $38,600 for single filers and $77,200 for joint filers."
Earnings out and they look good. A few more quarters like this and we might even see a dividend increase thus reversing a many years long trend of steady dividend decreases. I'm not holding my breath but it is possible.
$3. Yikes. Anybody know what’s up?
"Mickey, I think it is today, not sure if pre-market or after market though."
"Jeez, no one wants to comment on AI anymore? Where are all the ""bargain"" hunters?"
under their profile says they only have 12 full time employees. July 15 will be the big day they will report what their earning areThey need to cut somewhere in the company to grow the stock price and keep a descend dividend.
"So at $5.20 per share, AI is trading at 2/3 of book value ($7.80). And, it’s paying a phony dividend (real dividends are paid out of earnings) of nearly 20%. BY DEFINITION - AI will run out of capital (as defined by its market cap) in just 5 quarters (20% x 5). QUESTION: why haven’t the auditors (PWC) qualified their opinion subject to a “going concern”. Where are the lawyers here??"
"Thanks for the CLE reference Dan, Ed, et al. Love my teams! I have a close personal friend from college (in Ohio - go Bucks) who I stay in touch with about trading. He moved to the east coast many years ago but we’re still in frequent communication. The guy knows this stuff like the back of his hand as he works with tons of companies on Nasdaq and NYSE (he says both exchanges hate him because he’s too honest with their companies). He tells me that it’s just a matter of time before Arlington either dies or is acquired. Thus, That’s where I came up with the “DRIP DRIP DRIP, TICK TICK TICK, KABOOM” thing. I know it drives the ARlington puppets crazy. My only question is, and I would love your thoughts, does the pandemic buy AI more or less time before it’s imminent demise? Hmmm?"

"For the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 tax years, a portion of the cash distributions on the Company’s common stock should be treated as nontaxable return of capital. In effect, part of the ""dividend"" is the fact that they're giving you your money back."

Hmm, isn’t the valuation range a price target???? • And, the last page of the report states "" SCP has a non-exclusive Advisory Services agreement to provide research coverage, retail and institutional awareness, and overall Investor Relations support for which it is compensated $2,500 per month."". Hmm, AI pays SCP $30K per year for IR support????? • And, the last page of the reports states “Stonegate Capital Markets “SCM” (Member FINRA) is an affiliate of SCP and may seek to receive future compensation for investment banking or other business relationships with the covered companies mentioned in this report. In certain instances, SCP has contracted with SCM to produce research reports for its client companies. SCP pays SCM a monthly retainer for said services "". So an affiliate of SCM seeks compensation from AI via SCP?????Time for the law firms!!"
Are you island boy?
"In their previous earnings report they stated tangible book value was 11.06 They said this was the book value if treated as a REIT. Now that they are treated as a REIT, their book value on Jan 31 was 9.22. So they lost $1.84 in book value in one quarter? That's almost 17 percent. Doesn't this alarm anyone? I see no comments about this."
"I am quite confident that the NYSE called the company, now up almost 50% for the week. And the company likely responded no news. Had there been news, the exchange would have suspended trading for news pending. This, Monday morning’s virtual shareholders meeting is of utmost importance!Classic radio silence to their shareholders by AI !!DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICK"
Anyone want to wager on a common dividend?
"Opened a position @ $11.5,,, Crazy high dividend lured me in. We shall see. GLTA."
"MB, I kinda wondered that as well. I also own a LOT of NLY and our price was very constant (of course within a band between 12 - 20) and it payed a great dividend (.75 per share ea. quarter) during the darkest days of the 2008 housing bubble."
Guess interest rates causing some pain via 1Q results. Bought in AH a few shares.
"Even with the cut, it's still a double digit return. 14% ish."
Will it hold the $6 level?
"MREITS are complicated; most retail investors, that's us, don't really understand them, very well. I struggle with the QER's while many don't even try; and still others actually dig into them with gusto. I have a general understanding of how they make money and some of the pitfalls. AI has a long history of substandard performance. I've traded it in the past but never a holder; until very recently. The last 2 quarters, showing decent performance, in spite of the increasing rate environment, has got my attention. As rates rise, existing loans lose value; and the cost of borrowing increases causing reduced core earnings. Yet; in the last 2 quarters, they maintained core and actually improved GAPP. My theory is they have hired some some smart hedging talent."
This was a good day finally. Someone was accumulating before the Div I suspect. Level II gave them away. This has been in a few cent trading range too long. Now let us see what happens tomorrow.
WOW . We’re up a penny today. Break out the champagne
"Hate to say it, but I told you so. Dividend stays the same. I did grant the ""possibility"" of a small cut. How'd I know? Core earnings were over .625. Paper losses, and paper gains, don't really mean so much unless they are only losses, and huge. I am not smart, but I read and have a lot of experience with REIT's. It may gap up at the open and back off a little later in the day, so you can still get a terrific deal considering it will go much higher during next week."
"Disposed of my position today.Originally bought years ago when it was FBR, it was a good outfit back then.Taking what's left of my investment here and putting it into a company with a good management team where I have a chance to recoup my losses.Good luck to all the longs here."
"Everyone get their 1099 yet? If you're like me, were your AI ""dividends""marked ""Nondividend Distributions""?? If you go to their website and pokearound, you'll find a section ""Important Tax Information"". They'll inform you that ""a portion of the cash distributions on the Company'scommon stock should be treated as nontaxable return of capital"", andinform you about the Company's Form 8937. The form states:""Arlington Asset Investment Corp has determined that 100% of suchdistributions should be treated as a return of capital"""
dividend reinvestment is how you play this stock. long term
$5 calls looking sweet at 5 cents. Dividend announcement coming. They are forced to pay out 90% of income and quarter 4 spreads are way up over what was anticipated

Arlington Asset Investment posts 4Q profithttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/the-associated-press-arlington-asset-investment-posts-4q-profit.html
Today's selloff makes sense. Get out quick before Ex Div so as to not get the $.625 divvie. Yeah right? Market is crazy and AI is volatile for mysterious reasons. I guess just sit back and collect the divvies. GLLKen
"If you hold AI ( C Corp) in a taxable account, the dividends are consider qualified."
Dude what happen to AI? I been out a few years but didnt this use to be $20 stock? I would like to invest some especially since they were able to raise some capital over the last few months but seems alarming... why cant management just leave things simple. They try to oversmart themselves adding bets to interest rates when all we want is income through leverage.
"Ladies and Gentlemen. Please be advised that Arlington Asset Investment, a REIT not an artificial intelligence company who misleads you via its AI ticker symbol, will shockingly host its quarterly earnings call on an almost timely basis. Less than 48 hours from now(thanks for all the notice). You can listen in on July 30 at: https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2868725-1&h=603799837&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlingtonasset.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D19&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlingtonasset.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D19Please not that this is uncharacteristically timely for AI and suggests (to me at least) that they might actually have some good news to report. They typically drag it out for several more weeks to bury the bad news!! Tune in!!!!"
AI needs to pay monthly dividend to draw more interest.
"I MUST SAY. Good area for a REIT. around D.C. At 20% the 7.8 double rule says you get your money back in 1/2, or 3.9 yrs."
