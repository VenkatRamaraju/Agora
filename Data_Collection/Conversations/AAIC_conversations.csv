Will I ever get above water? Jeez.
"Love the commentary by those ""expert"" types....from Simply Wall Street:""The general public holds a substantial 59% stake in Arlington Asset Investment, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.""Ok, all you public investors, start swaying the key decisions!!"
"Anyone think if this is a good buy ? 17% dividend yield looks very high, is there a reducing coming?"
"I can breath easier now that the $.55 has been declared. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see an increase.Ken"
"I have not checked my Fidelity acct for years! My 27500 shares of AAIC has lost $395,419.04 or 79.52% with an average cost basis of $18.08! Such a deal!"
"Changing ticker from ""AI"" to ""AAIC""....with no explanation why. There are costs in doing so. Trying to hide past?"
"Common share dividend could be reinstated for Q4, depending on core earnings as reported in the upcoming ER. Huge discount to BV in the meantime. And finally, based on 90+% of the posts here, the sentiment is clearly lousy. All adds up to a GREAT SPECULATIVE BUY."

Arlington Asset Investment declares $0.225 dividend
Curious how the new tax code will impact Arlington. Any thoughts??
"The Executive Compensation table for 2017 shows Eric F. Billings, the Executive Chairman receiving $3,072,617 in Incentive Plan, Stock Awards and other compensation. Likewise, J.Rock Tonkel, Jr., Chief Executive Officer and President received $3,072,438. My question is with the dividend being cut from .55 to .375 per sh/quarter, and the stock price falling into the mid tens, how does management justify their large compensation? Also there is $139.00 of cash per share, a very very large amount of funds for this C Corporation to be holding, Why can't management award some of these funds to the deserving shareholders instead of awarding themselves with increasingly high compensations?Value1"
Just read on Seeking Alpha that Arlington has filed a prospectus for a 750M mixed shelf offering.It's the only place I've seen this info so far.
"Arlington Asset Investment Corp. Declares Second Quarter 2020 Dividends on Preferred Stock and Provides Update on Common Stock Dividend.Well, perhaps after a few quarters paying only the preferred we'll see a small dividend for us poor bag holders with common shares. I'm not holding my breath, mind you, but it would be nice."
hopefully this stock will gain momentum soon. but still making it with dividends help so far
the trick here is long term reinvestment of dividends. most people don't do it.
AAIC is rated the worst in a recent study!Really?
"""Roll another one....just like the other one!"""
"In their previous earnings report they stated tangible book value was 11.06 They said this was the book value if treated as a REIT. Now that they are treated as a REIT, their book value on Jan 31 was 9.22. So they lost $1.84 in book value in one quarter? That's almost 17 percent. Doesn't this alarm anyone? I see no comments about this."
On Friday Ford Equity Research upgraded from hold to buy saying AI is undervalued. Others have a hold or neutral.
Dude what happen to AI? I been out a few years but didnt this use to be $20 stock? I would like to invest some especially since they were able to raise some capital over the last few months but seems alarming... why cant management just leave things simple. They try to oversmart themselves adding bets to interest rates when all we want is income through leverage.
Everyone...you're weeks behind. Do your DD. Your options are almost over to recoup your investments. Think about what's happened over the past few weeks!
@Cleve et. al.I’ve been hit with the idea that any number of people are investing in stocks based on some technical formula without any idea of the company they’re investing in. It’s business. It’s challenges. Management. etc. See the green light & buy.It would explain why some think this an artificial intelligence company.Don’t quite know what to make of my insight.Your opinion?
"""Turning to our actual results for the quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $0.52 per share and core operating income of $0.32 per share. "" ---From their earnings call.Gee, I'm almost impressed. If they can keep this up, they could actually fund their dividend and have money to invest."
AI at 20% dividend is a GIFT !!!
How about a liquidation?
"people panic because of dividend cuts, and sell. Lets face it your here because the dividend pays more than a bank so why panic if your here long term"
"I've been trying to put a number on value for AI. It's starting to look like the dividend can be sustained; and, lately, they even seem to be increasing BV, in spite of a tough rate environment. How? I suspect they've learned how to hedge this environment. If I could be certain their performance would remain this good, long term, I could see it in the $20's in a few quarters. Last quarter it reached the mid $12's; now, with another good quarter, even a little better actually, I think we break $13 after the dividend is announced."
Anyone want to wager on a common dividend?
I think Everyone would feel better about this stock if it could hold its stock price. It not and the Board needs to be paid based on performance. I think they need to show stock holders they have skin in the game. they need to set up a target price above where we are at today with at least a 5 to 10 percent increase per quarter.
Up 2 centavo's!
i purchases AI preferred stock ai-pc today to vote out the board unless they re-instate thequarterly dividends for the common stock investors.
This company is being run for the benefit of management not share holders. Vote your shares to punish management and the board. fire them all.
Dividend incoming - end of year they HAVE to make a distribution to meet the requirements... it makes sense
Bought some AI shares on November 6th 2019. but still have not received the dividend from December 30th 2019. Have you guys receiver your dividend / can you explain why I have not seen any so far? Thanks a lot in advance!
Is anybody having an issues receiving the dividend payout?
In 2003 this was $500+/share?
Year ago close....$11.27. Accumulated dividends since then.....$1.50. Today....will it hold $7? But isn't the dividend great!?
Can someone explain me the profit margin of -190%? thank you :)
"Why isn't This Fund Holding its price, It pays a great dividend but can't hold its Stock Price. Can someone Explain?"
"I noted a comment that buying under book value is smart. Totally WRONG. Ever asked yourself why anyone would TRADE below BV? Simple - GAAP BV is a false measure of the discounted future earnings!!And even accepting your thesis, 4.06 is a joke. They are merely pumping their own stock at the expense of shareholders.Time to Investigate!"
