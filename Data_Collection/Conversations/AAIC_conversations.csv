On Friday Ford Equity Research upgraded from hold to buy saying AI is undervalued. Others have a hold or neutral.
Anyone want to wager on a common dividend?
"The last page of the Stonegate report raises serious conflict of interest questions. It states: • The last line of the report states "" SCP does not have a price target for any securities of the Company. "". Yet page 7 of the report states "" Based on our FY19 EPS estimate, Arlington is trading a P/E ratio of 5.1x vs. median comparables at 8.2x. Considering current and 3-year historical trading ranges of AI and comps, we believe using a P /E multiple range of 4.0x to 8.0x is reasonable. Using the range on our FY19 EPS estimate, we arrive at a valuation range of ~$4.09 to ~$8.18 with a mid-point of ~$6.14 "". Hmm, isn’t the valuation range a price target???? • And, the last page of the report states "" SCP has a non-exclusive Advisory Services agreement to provide research coverage, retail and institutional awareness, and overall Investor Relations support for which it is compensated $2,500 per month."". Hmm, AI pays SCP $30K per year for IR support????? • And, the last page of the reports states “Stonegate Capital Markets “SCM” (Member FINRA) is an affiliate of SCP and may seek to receive future compensation for investment banking or other business relationships with the covered companies mentioned in this report. In certain instances, SCP has contracted with SCM to produce research reports for its client companies. SCP pays SCM a monthly retainer for said services "". So an affiliate of SCM seeks compensation from AI via SCP?????Time for the law firms!!"
"Everyone get their 1099 yet? If you're like me, were your AI ""dividends""marked ""Nondividend Distributions""?? If you go to their website and pokearound, you'll find a section ""Important Tax Information"". They'll inform you that ""a portion of the cash distributions on the Company'scommon stock should be treated as nontaxable return of capital"", andinform you about the Company's Form 8937. The form states:""Arlington Asset Investment Corp has determined that 100% of suchdistributions should be treated as a return of capital"""
$5 calls looking sweet at 5 cents. Dividend announcement coming. They are forced to pay out 90% of income and quarter 4 spreads are way up over what was anticipated
Could $AI be planning to reinstate common dividend?
It's nice that I do not have to pay taxes on this dividend since AI is a C corp.
Dude what happen to AI? I been out a few years but didnt this use to be $20 stock? I would like to invest some especially since they were able to raise some capital over the last few months but seems alarming... why cant management just leave things simple. They try to oversmart themselves adding bets to interest rates when all we want is income through leverage.
"people panic because of dividend cuts, and sell. Lets face it your here because the dividend pays more than a bank so why panic if your here long term"
AAIC reached an all time high at 3.13
You will recall that they have a shelf registration out there. Hard to imagine that they would float shares down here - but desperation is a strange bedfellow!
hopefully this stock will gain momentum soon. but still making it with dividends help so far
This company is hanging on by a thread. I have written it off as a total loss in my plans although do hope that it can somehow survive and at some point resume paying a dividend. What nut case would buy it I cannot imagine.
I think Everyone would feel better about this stock if it could hold its stock price. It not and the Board needs to be paid based on performance. I think they need to show stock holders they have skin in the game. they need to set up a target price above where we are at today with at least a 5 to 10 percent increase per quarter.
In 2003 this was $500+/share?
"Here’s a thought for all you happy investors - AI, often mistaken as a tech stock, is at its post-pandemic high even though REITS are out of favor. The tyranny of the quarterly call is just weeks away (although they try to hide that from you). So are you ready for this. (trumpets) - to insure that they have enough cash to keep paying outrageous comp, it’s time to dust off that shelf registration and raise some cash!! That’s right. To hell with the suckers who bought this stock at 10,20,30.... they need to keep the candy store shelves stocked with cash. I figure they can fetch at $2 a share from some fresh meat! No worries.... it’s highly dilutive but not fatal."
Looks like the Artificial Intelligence bots were finally reprogrammed to ignore us.
modest ouch
"I am quite confident that the NYSE called the company, now up almost 50% for the week. And the company likely responded no news. Had there been news, the exchange would have suspended trading for news pending. This, Monday morning’s virtual shareholders meeting is of utmost importance!Classic radio silence to their shareholders by AI !!DRIP DRIP DRIPTICK TICK TICK"
"Common share dividend could be reinstated for Q4, depending on core earnings as reported in the upcoming ER. Huge discount to BV in the meantime. And finally, based on 90+% of the posts here, the sentiment is clearly lousy. All adds up to a GREAT SPECULATIVE BUY."
why is ai tanking today? they announced the earnings meeting not the earnings
"Earnings today, fingers crossed we have a market with positive momentum by then an a good report from AI. Love the dividend. I'd hate to bail. GL"
Waiting patiently for my massive dividend to get applied. Sweet!
"I've been trying to put a number on value for AI. It's starting to look like the dividend can be sustained; and, lately, they even seem to be increasing BV, in spite of a tough rate environment. How? I suspect they've learned how to hedge this environment. If I could be certain their performance would remain this good, long term, I could see it in the $20's in a few quarters. Last quarter it reached the mid $12's; now, with another good quarter, even a little better actually, I think we break $13 after the dividend is announced."
"For the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 tax years, a portion of the cash distributions on the Company’s common stock should be treated as nontaxable return of capital. In effect, part of the ""dividend"" is the fact that they're giving you your money back."
Market up 3%. AI up 22%. I smell a deal.
"Question for the board - Anonymous posted ""Arlington Asset Investment BV rises in July; shares jump 8.1%"". That information was fed to Anonymous by the company prematurely disclosing part of their third quarter performance (July) in their 2Q press release. It smells as a deceptive tactic that says 'Don't focus on our 2Q disaster (that took the stock down below $6) but rather that we losing less money in the first month of the third quarter. I find that to be materially misleading and improper disclosure that is not protected by safe harbor. Do you agree with me that it is time for lawyers to take a closer look at this charade perpetrated by two guys who rape the shareholders at every turn? Where is the SEC? Where is the NYSE? Where are the investor activists? Time to ""liquidate and claw back""! Yea or nay?"
No dividend likely at this point because I don 't believe they had any actual earnings. A REIT must pay out 90% of earnings.
"Why isn't This Fund Holding its price, It pays a great dividend but can't hold its Stock Price. Can someone Explain?"
"Arlington Asset Investment (AI) shed 6% in recent pre-market trade after it said late Thursday that its board had approved a 32% cut in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 per common share from $0.55.The dividend will be paid on July 31 to common shareholders of record on June 29.Price: 11.32, Change: +0.04, Percent Change: +0.35"
dividend is more than any interest you can make from banks
@Cleve et. al.I’ve been hit with the idea that any number of people are investing in stocks based on some technical formula without any idea of the company they’re investing in. It’s business. It’s challenges. Management. etc. See the green light & buy.It would explain why some think this an artificial intelligence company.Don’t quite know what to make of my insight.Your opinion?
Downgraded by Maxim this morning.
AI is up 6.96% to 10.91
"These guys lose money almost every quarter, and the market is so uncomfortable with them that their price to book ratio is less than one. I see nothing that makes me think that investing wit these guys makes sense. Given the salaries involved, they are doing an excellent job of converting investors capital into their capital."
"Even with the cut, it's still a double digit return. 14% ish."
AI at 20% dividend is a GIFT !!!
I am averaging down today. I see target has been reduced. I have faith in the management of this REIT. They are 100% agency backed now and in the Q & A they said the 2nd Quarter will adjust to the environment. Must admit it is my gut feeling of management.
"""Roll another one....just like the other one!"""
"I’m new to stocks; so when I saw the price drop significantly I got a little worried, but I did more research and found out that it’s normal for the price to drop on ex div day. My 2 questions are: can AI recover and go back to the high 11’s and even hopefully the 12’s? Do investors typically buy more of the stocks knowing that the price goes way down?Thank you guys for any feedback"
"""Turning to our actual results for the quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $0.52 per share and core operating income of $0.32 per share. "" ---From their earnings call.Gee, I'm almost impressed. If they can keep this up, they could actually fund their dividend and have money to invest."
Still my best paying dividend stock.
Question for the Board. Thinking more about Ed’s point on the buyback. Is the failure to make adequate disclosure about the buyback a breach of fiduciary responsibility or grounds for the SEC and plaintiffs bar to get involved???
"Interesting earnings report; loss of .20 per share; book value fell by 3%; no dividend.But....""With regard to its REIT requirements, the company does have the flexibility to utilize its tax loss carryforwards to reduce its taxable income and annual distribution requirements. The company will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of its common stock at accretive prices.""Do people buy mREITs to get a return of capital via share buybacks??"
Management needs to buy some shares.
"Danny Boy, Mr Ed, et al. You inquired about buyback disclosure requirements. I think AI’s got a MAJOR PROBLEM. Per Skadden Arps the following is required: Should a company publicly disclose its share repurchase program?Yes. In order to avoid potential liability for insider trading in connection with a share repurchase program, a company should publicly disclose the program prior to its commencement. Because the extent of the required public disclosure depends on the facts specific to the share repurchase program, disclosure should be made after consultation with counsel. At a minimum, disclosure should be made with enough time to allow the market to absorb the announcement and include the following information: the estimated time period during which the purchases will be made; the maximum number of shares proposed to be acquired or the maximum amount of funds to be expended; the objective of the acquisition of shares; any plan or proposal relating to the disposition of the shares to be purchased; and an indication of how the purchases will be made. The disclosure may be made in a Form 10-Q or 10-K, or by means of a press release or Form 8-K, depending upon timing of the approval and commencement of the program. The company also should issue a public announcement disclosing any material modifications to a share repurchase program (and should announce any increase in the size of the program). Is a company subject to any reporting requirements in connection with its repurchase program?Yes. Item 703 of Regulation S-K requires that, for all issuer repurchases of equity securities (whether an open market or private transaction), the company must disclose in its next periodic report the following information, in tabular form, for each month of the preceding fiscal quarter:4 the total number of shares purchased; the average price paid per share; the number of shares purchased as part of a publicly announced program; and the maximum number of shares (or approximate dollar value) that may yet be repurchased under the program. Additionally, for publicly announced programs, the SEC requires disclosure (in footnotes to the table) of the following information: the date of the announcement; the share or dollar amount approved by the board of directors; the expiration date (if any) of the program; each program that has expired during the last fiscal quarter; and each program that the issuer has determined to terminate prior to expiration or under which the issuer does not intend to make further purchases. Companies generally also include disclosure in the liquidity and capital resource section of their “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in their annual and quarterly reports"
Has anyone been around long enough to explain the massive decline from 2003 to 2008?
Dividend incoming - end of year they HAVE to make a distribution to meet the requirements... it makes sense
Up 2 centavo's!
Guys. This is the second time in two days that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) message has been posted to this Board. Clearly there is investor confusion as Arlington Asset Investment is in the REIT business! Please change our ticker to AAI.
"Mickey, I think it is today, not sure if pre-market or after market though."
"Question: Since AI has not been paying ""real"" dividends, but returning capital over the years.....what happens if/when your share goes negative?? For example, say you bought now at $8.xx, and over the next six years they continue to pay out (apparently, out of capital), $.375 per quarter or $1.50 a year....do you now have ""negative capital""? So if you sell, how would that be handled via taxes?"
Earnings look positive. Tomorrow should be exciting
Anyone think the #$%$ of a stock is every going to pay a dividend again? I'm a split second from dumping it and taking the lost on my taxes in order to get into anything better!
Earnings out and they are OK. Quick summary: blah blah blah no dividends for commoners!
"PURCHASED RESEARCH Danger, danger Will Robinson! Beware - Conflict of Interest.Stonegate Capital Research is NOT INDEPENDENT!!Per the fine print on the last page of their report: “.SCP has a non-exclusive Advisory Services agreement to provide research coverage, retail and institutional awareness, and overall Investor Relations support and for which it is compensated $2,500 per month. SCP’s equity affiliate, Stonegate Capital Markets (SCM) - member FINRA/SIPC - may seek to provide investment banking services on the securities covered in this report for which it could be compensated “And, they even list themselves as the Investor Relations contact!So much for being able to rely upon their “valuation”!!! Can this company DO ANYTHING without some degree of shady conduct???"
"No dividend cut as many feared based on 4Q despite statement of recovery in January.1.50 / 8.50 = 17.65% yield.1.50 / 16% = price of 9.375IMO, nice pop tomorrow."
"Well the report wasn't bad at all considering their leverage. But going forward they need to either re-leverage up and become a real MReit or buy back stock hand over fist. Option C is to liquidate, but management I suppose still wants their jobs."
up almost 4%. While that is nice I see no recent news to account for it. Anyone have a clue or a guess?
"Thanks for the CLE reference Dan, Ed, et al. Love my teams! I have a close personal friend from college (in Ohio - go Bucks) who I stay in touch with about trading. He moved to the east coast many years ago but we’re still in frequent communication. The guy knows this stuff like the back of his hand as he works with tons of companies on Nasdaq and NYSE (he says both exchanges hate him because he’s too honest with their companies). He tells me that it’s just a matter of time before Arlington either dies or is acquired. Thus, That’s where I came up with the “DRIP DRIP DRIP, TICK TICK TICK, KABOOM” thing. I know it drives the ARlington puppets crazy. My only question is, and I would love your thoughts, does the pandemic buy AI more or less time before it’s imminent demise? Hmmm?"
"In their previous earnings report they stated tangible book value was 11.06 They said this was the book value if treated as a REIT. Now that they are treated as a REIT, their book value on Jan 31 was 9.22. So they lost $1.84 in book value in one quarter? That's almost 17 percent. Doesn't this alarm anyone? I see no comments about this."
"Do you get the feeling that they buy back shares just before earnings reports....so things don't seem so bad? What would concern me would be the almost 40% of non-agency ""mortgage credit investment strategies"" they have in their portfolio."
Question for the Board: Has anyone sent their letter to the SEC / NYSE yet? I drafted mine and am still editing it.Stock is down BIG again this morning? Hovering near all time low. Time for “Liquidation and five year claw back of management comp” !!!
Tomorrow is ex div so in theory it should open 22.5 cents lower or $6.525. Any close above that number will be a positive sign. Assuming my arithmetic is correct.
"Hmm, up 20+% on heavy volume. Could it be.....that at long last they’ve found a merger partner? God, let’s hope so!!!!"
Impressive beat; shows they have learned how to hedge this rate environment. I think they keep the dividend at $.55. Two quarters of good performance in a very tough rate environment will get some attention; good chance we get back to the $13's. Gotta admit I was negative on AI before report. Wish I'd jumped in big yesterday.
Will I ever get above water? Jeez.
Who sell 250000 shares of a 20% dividend stock BEFORE the distribution. No one in their right mind.Sometimes I think the big guys manipulate the market so much that individuals don't stand a chance. Driving down the price so they can buy cheap and collect the dividend. It's nothing for them to sell 250000 shares when their holding millions of shares and will get a .55 dividend.
The ineptitude of this company’s management is amazing. Their inability to thrive in a good economy speaks volumes. I will be selling when I have use for the write off. I’ve had this in my portfolio since before the meltdown in 2008. Experienced the 1 for 20 reverse split 10 years ago and multiple dividend reductions since. I should have unloaded my position years ago.
i purchases AI preferred stock ai-pc today to vote out the board unless they re-instate thequarterly dividends for the common stock investors.
Dividend news incoming
Up three day in a row on better than average volume. I could get used to this. I need a double from here to get back even. I would need more than a triple to get even if I hadn't been reinvesting dividends all these years.
"I don't see an announced earnings date, just a range."
"When I finally saw the light and sold my AI, I put the $$ in NRZ; no regrets. NRZ yield is about 11% and it's reliable! I got a dividend, and about 10% in cap gain. Also; digging into it I discover that NRZ is expected to raise their dividend soon because earnings have increased a lot since their last increase."
"Has anyone read the article ""Is Arlington Asset Investment Corp.a good stock to buy ? ""Is it factual ?"
Everyone...you're weeks behind. Do your DD. Your options are almost over to recoup your investments. Think about what's happened over the past few weeks!

"Finally some positive momentum, hopefully it can get back to the 13 range again. The dividend is nice though."
Hmmm...maybe they'll pay a dividend in 2021?
fortunately I have 80 July 20 10 strike put contracts to balance the big loss tomorrow stock could go sub 8

Ed. Question for you as I have not yet researched this: how much NOL does AI have and are they carrying it as a deferred asset on their B/S?? This is a pretty important question at this perilous time.
"What's going on ? Stock closed at $ 9.03/s, book value is $ 10.56/s. Total cash is $ 4.08B and total debt is $ 3.83B. Can anyone explain this ?"
"It's a beautiful day down on the floor of the NYSE. The DOW is up another 150 points and bounced back another 500 points yesterday afternoon. BUT WAIT - WHAT'S THIS? You mean to say that while the entire market was skyrocketing for thousands of companies (and their investors) our little Arlington Asset Investment got taken to the woodshed and IS DOWN BIG AGAIN THIS MORNING? HUH? WHAT'S THAT? Management says - ignore what I'm saying about Q2, we had a good July. But an analyst on the call then asks: so how is August looking, Rock? Oooops....here we go again. TIME TO CALL THE COPS! ""We was robbed!"""
"I can breath easier now that the $.55 has been declared. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see an increase.Ken"
Consistently pays a dividend yield of $.55 (19%) quarterly!
"As usual, Fast Eddie is correct with two small exceptions:- they moved to McLain to cut their rent and county taxes; and- while they closed out their higher risk non-agency positions, their business model is unsustainable. Their enormous comp (to include stock) for a group of less than a dozen people (plus a rubber stamp board of insiders) is greater than peers many times their size and who produce superior returns. They are thieves and belong in jail!"
Can someone explain me the profit margin of -190%? thank you :)
Vote out all board members.
"I noted a comment that buying under book value is smart. Totally WRONG. Ever asked yourself why anyone would TRADE below BV? Simple - GAAP BV is a false measure of the discounted future earnings!!And even accepting your thesis, 4.06 is a joke. They are merely pumping their own stock at the expense of shareholders.Time to Investigate!"
Reduced distribution but at least it hasn't been cut this last quarter. Pretty decent earnings. Up a bit in AH. I don't really expect to see this trading a whole lot higher over the coming year but as long as the distribution doesn't get cut again I'm happy with a 20% yield. Of course their coverage ratio is pretty tight just about 1.0 meaning they have very little margin for error. I would really like to see the FFO at $2.50 or more.
"Update: per SeEC Form 4 filings, CEO just bought 100,000 shares and CFO bought 20,000 at 2.68. Hence, the movement up in the stock price.Now, if they then reinstalled the “fake dividend” that would be an enormous legal problem. In other words, they purchased stock via insider information. Thus, no dividend anytime soon!!"
Per article in Seeking Alpha - AI has lowest tangible price to book ratio of all Mreits. This might be a great time to buy.
Pure manipulation.
Helluva pop this AM thanks to one of best quarterly earnings in a long time. I doubt we'll see the share price climb to levels of past years but at least for the time being it appears that the already much reduced dividend is secure. Ken
"Anyone think if this is a good buy ? 17% dividend yield looks very high, is there a reducing coming?"
"High dividend stocks are out of favor...interest rates going up....people are selling and buying bank stocks...everything I have that pays a dividend over 10% is getting hit...REITs, C Corps, MLP's etc....."
Dan. Makes perfect sense. I think Pete’s point is - why here / why now? Question: can this investigation cause the company to liquidate us at or near BV (around 5.75 / share) minus the extortion of $10 million that we will have to management (which is over10% of market cap). I think we should all contact this Zamansky firm and vent our frustrations!!!
Yep going to be a bad day tomorrow
Arlington Asset Investment declares $0.225 dividend
Bought some AI shares on November 6th 2019. but still have not received the dividend from December 30th 2019. Have you guys receiver your dividend / can you explain why I have not seen any so far? Thanks a lot in advance!
Well that was a short rally. At least we'll get the dividend this quarter.Ken
That the CEO gets any salary at all much less well over $1 million is really a sad commentary on the state of capitalism in America. Total incompetent executive in a company whose stock has plummeted and whose dividend as been suspended with no restoration in sight but still makes more than almost any of the employees or investors. My only consolation is that his stock options have plummeted also.
Guess interest rates causing some pain via 1Q results. Bought in AH a few shares.
Stock continues to rise despite the negative input on this message board. I expect the stock to hit $12 this week.
I bought this today to vote the officers out unless they re-instate the dividends for the quarterly common stock investors.
"MB, I kinda wondered that as well. I also own a LOT of NLY and our price was very constant (of course within a band between 12 - 20) and it payed a great dividend (.75 per share ea. quarter) during the darkest days of the 2008 housing bubble."
Anything below $11.55 is a huge buying opportunity in my experienced opinion.
"good question. why are they sliding? it is about time AI took aturnaround and started climbing again. agree that the managementis out of line taking a large bonus in the ""incentive plan"" when it isan obvous bust. it has not performed. they have not performed. theyowe us something for this bad business. they need to raise the diviand the stock needs to start climbing again or it can only be called abust."
AAIC is rated the worst in a recent study!Really?
This company is being run for the benefit of management not share holders. Vote your shares to punish management and the board. fire them all.
"no dividend common stock, vote them out"
Is nayone concerned about the recent double botton in AI?
"I thought today was xdiv? Guess it's tomorrow? The market doesn't seem to like AI. I understand the chart looks bad; especially over last 5 years. And yes, they have a history of cutting the dividend. I hope things have improved but many are skeptical, with good reason. it may take another few quarters of stable performance to get the pps back over $12. I was wrong and probably wrong also in assuming it won't fall back under $10, after xdiv. I'll keep my small holding but I don't blame anyone for dumping."
"Ladies and Gentlemen. Please be advised that Arlington Asset Investment, a REIT not an artificial intelligence company who misleads you via its AI ticker symbol, will shockingly host its quarterly earnings call on an almost timely basis. Less than 48 hours from now(thanks for all the notice). You can listen in on July 30 at: https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2868725-1&h=603799837&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlingtonasset.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D19&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlingtonasset.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D19Please not that this is uncharacteristically timely for AI and suggests (to me at least) that they might actually have some good news to report. They typically drag it out for several more weeks to bury the bad news!! Tune in!!!!"
under their profile says they only have 12 full time employees. July 15 will be the big day they will report what their earning areThey need to cut somewhere in the company to grow the stock price and keep a descend dividend.
"Question: is the unusually early call due to: A. - good news for shareholders, or. B. - convenient for management’s August vacation schedule. Upon further reflection, I think it might be B!!!!"
"IMHO AI is a buy, great dividend and trading at 84 cents on the dollar. What is not to like."
Just read on Seeking Alpha that Arlington has filed a prospectus for a 750M mixed shelf offering.It's the only place I've seen this info so far.
"Love the commentary by those ""expert"" types....from Simply Wall Street:""The general public holds a substantial 59% stake in Arlington Asset Investment, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.""Ok, all you public investors, start swaying the key decisions!!"
"Changing ticker from ""AI"" to ""AAIC""....with no explanation why. There are costs in doing so. Trying to hide past?"
In light of the recent market carnage I'm happy to sit back and bank/DRIP my 20% dividend.It's nice to be able to relax as others panic. GL
"I have not checked my Fidelity acct for years! My 27500 shares of AAIC has lost $395,419.04 or 79.52% with an average cost basis of $18.08! Such a deal!"
Dividend Yield 19.26% you really think that is sustainable?
dividend reinvestment is how you play this stock. long term
Is anybody having an issues receiving the dividend payout?
This company does not earn any income Over the last 12 months it lost $2 per share and yet it pad distribution of $1.50 per shareIt keeps selling new shares to pay distribution Like a Ponzi scheme Someday in the next five years it may go out of business I sold my shares
"Once again good eye, Ed. For Crazy man and the other BTC haters here, I tried to warn you. Stevie Wonder could see this one coming. NO DIVIDEND. But the question now remaining is “why did mgt wait 10 days to disclose this while the price was doubling?”!! Here comes the law suits. And there’s more ugly disclosures in the AI press release: The Company has also provided the following updates. • The Company has satisfied all of its margin calls under its financing arrangements. • The Company estimates that its book value per common share as of March 24, 2020 has declined in a range of approximately 32% to 36% since December 31, 2019. • The Company de-levered its investment portfolio and estimates that its ""at risk"" short term secured financing to investable capital ratio has been reduced to approximately 1.6 to 1 from 8.7 to 1 as of December 31, 2019.[1] • The Company remains committed to preserving long-term value for its shareholders while also protecting its employees during this difficult time."
AI needs to pay monthly dividend to draw more interest.

Declares Second Quarter 2020 Dividends on Preferred Stock and Provides Update on Common Stock Dividend.Well, perhaps after a few quarters paying only the preferred we'll see a small dividend for us poor bag holders with common shares. I'm not holding my breath, mind you, but it would be nice."

1.58% AH drop. I suspect folks are fearful of yet another dividend cut. Most of the past years have seen the Announcement at about this time and the fact that it is delayed is not reassuring. Ken
"Oh the weather outside is frightfulBut the DOW is so delightfulAnd since AI just can’t growLet it go, Let it go, Let it go!It doesn’t show signs of profitAnd management just ain’t got it The stock price is way down lowLet it go, Let it go, Let it goMr Wolf and all the LongsJust hate these kinds of songsSince AI just can’t growLet it go, Let it go, Let it goMerry Christmas Tick, tick, tickDrip drip drip!"
the trick here is long term reinvestment of dividends. most people don't do it.
Curious how the new tax code will impact Arlington. Any thoughts??
Div cut to .375! I tried to warn you guys but you didn't like what I said.
Hmmm. More investor confusion per Tom’s post! Perhaps time to call the SEC??? How long must investors be misled???
Technical indicators flashing buy signals for AI. GLTA.
"Thomas, one can only speculate. AI lost 67 cents per share and paid out 22 cents in phony dividends (real dividends are paid out of earnings not losses!) in Q2. Hence, AI just burned through 89 cents of equity. Using,then, the most current quarter as a proxy and at a stock price of $5.70 or so, the company will be BK by the end of next year. This is precisely why I have endeavored to inspire this board to “Liquidate and claw back 5 years of undue management enrichment” ! We need to act now before it’s too late. Please join me in raising our voices on this atrocity!"
Read ‘m and weep guys. The 2Q earnings release is out and the sea of red continues while the top two guys ripped another half million $$ ++ out of our pockets. Stock now trading at about 80% of book. Time to “Liquidate and claw back 5 years” of bogus comp. We need a Carl Icahn. Anybody got one????
Has dividend for common stock been announced?
I will hold my shares just to vote out all board members.
How about a liquidation?
Time to demand a cut in management salaries.
"So at $5.20 per share, AI is trading at 2/3 of book value ($7.80). And, it’s paying a phony dividend (real dividends are paid out of earnings) of nearly 20%. BY DEFINITION - AI will run out of capital (as defined by its market cap) in just 5 quarters (20% x 5). QUESTION: why haven’t the auditors (PWC) qualified their opinion subject to a “going concern”. Where are the lawyers here??"
AI uses market-to-market. Book Value is $5.28. Now trading at 43% of book. I challenge anyone on this board to come up with ANY SINGLE REASON why this company should not be LIQUIDATED IMMEDIATELY!!!
"Question: in addition to the multi-million $ comp packages (to include a guy who just retired with a massive advisor contract) , why does a teeny weeny little company like ours require the most expensive HQ in Arlington. Replete with a spectacular view of the WH, Capital, Lincoln and Jefferson Monuments, the AI offices are phenomenal. This has to be the most self-serving mgt in America. Is such elegance essential to our success? Hell no! Their attitude toward shareholders is “let them eat cake”. Time to end the shareholder abuse!"
any opinions on recent earnings report? I'd call it good but not great. We need 2 more good reports and we need to see an increase in the cash available for distribution.
"Disposed of my position today.Originally bought years ago when it was FBR, it was a good outfit back then.Taking what's left of my investment here and putting it into a company with a good management team where I have a chance to recoup my losses.Good luck to all the longs here."
"Same distribution. Price down 5% on heavy volume, very strange price action."
Why does this POS keep dropping?
"Big fall today with the overall market. It was not enough to break it's uptrend. Still several weeks till they announce the dividend; so there's time for the traders to play with it. It may retest the most recent low; but maybe not since their last report was very good. Of course, a bear raid is always possible. I will hold for the dividend but maybe buy more if it dips below my cost basis."
Year ago close....$11.27. Accumulated dividends since then.....$1.50. Today....will it hold $7? But isn't the dividend great!?
"The Executive Compensation table for 2017 shows Eric F. Billings, the Executive Chairman receiving $3,072,617 in Incentive Plan, Stock Awards and other compensation. Likewise, J.Rock Tonkel, Jr., Chief Executive Officer and President received $3,072,438. My question is with the dividend being cut from .55 to .375 per sh/quarter, and the stock price falling into the mid tens, how does management justify their large compensation? Also there is $139.00 of cash per share, a very very large amount of funds for this C Corporation to be holding, Why can't management award some of these funds to the deserving shareholders instead of awarding themselves with increasingly high compensations?Value1"
SP adjusting for dividend which get applied today.
"How can thestreet give this stock a C rating, when most are down on it. what do they see? Can anyone explain?"
Earnings report on Nov 3. Anything else going on that date that might distract folks?
