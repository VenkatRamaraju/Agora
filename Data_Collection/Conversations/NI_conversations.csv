"NI electric is going 100% renewable. Countries that have done this have almost tripled their electric rates. Germany for example rates are almost triple the rates in the United States. They have enough windmill capacity to connected on line to provide 100% of their load. However because the wind does not always blow the wind mills only supply about 5% of their energy requirements. Tanzania is 100% dependent on hydroelectric power, they have continuous rolling blackouts What NI should be building is gas fired combined cycle plants plants. When NI finally figures out this is a bad idea, I will submit my resume to become the CEO, I can make equally poor decisions for a lot less money."
"The Covid 19 forced people staying home and the Electric and Gas usage are HIGH. Cooking, washing, running Air Conditioning to stay cool. My monthly bills are high and NI should be benefiting from this. They should meet or beat their up coming earnings."
The last 9 months had been the greatest bull market and this stock hardly moved. How can it be a great stock?
Here in Pennsylvania several state legislators have gone to the state Public Utilities Commission because of the new corporate tax rates in an effort to lower electric rates etc. The Pa State Utilities Commission has agreed that electric rates are too high due to the new corporate tax rates and is having hearings to lower electric rates. How will this then effect NISource and their rates an asking for new rate increases ?
New High !!

"The next six months, argues the analyst, will see ""strong volume expansion"" at Nio as the company:Introduces its ET7 electric sedan in China (expected to go on sale in Q1 next year),Enters the Norwegian electric car market internationally.Advertises new wares in China at its upcoming ""Nio Day 2021."" Among the unveilings expected there will be Nio's second electric sedan, the anticipated ET5 (which Fang expects to be comparable to a Tesla Model 3).Profits should grow nicely as well, especially thanks to the ET7, which Fang points out is expected to be ""China's priciest car model launched by a domestic brand."""
Does NI carry corporate liability insurance for these disasters or ?
"According to their Proxy statement, the CEO has a base salary of 975,000 with incentives up to $5,000,000. The main responsibility of a gas utility is to provide gas safely and the company utterly failed on this. Probably too much emphasis on rate increases, financial engineering and executive compensation and not enough of customer safety. If the regulators are going to do their job then they should require a complete safety overall before allowing any executive bonuses or dividends."
"NI = great dividend at 3.75%, so undervalued stock.....good company..."
