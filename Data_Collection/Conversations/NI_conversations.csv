Here in Pennsylvania several state legislators have gone to the state Public Utilities Commission because of the new corporate tax rates in an effort to lower electric rates etc. The Pa State Utilities Commission has agreed that electric rates are too high due to the new corporate tax rates and is having hearings to lower electric rates. How will this then effect NISource and their rates an asking for new rate increases ?

"Panasonic $PCRFY is one of the few EV stocks that didn't go down today. ($TSLA, $GM, $F, $STLA, $VWAGY, $NI, $XPEV, $NKLA, $RIDE, $CCIV). As I keep repeating, Panasonic is a value stock that's still cheap. we should see more money moving into it."

"NI electric is going 100% renewable. Countries that have done this have almost tripled their electric rates. Germany for example rates are almost triple the rates in the United States. They have enough windmill capacity to connected on line to provide 100% of their load. However because the wind does not always blow the wind mills only supply about 5% of their energy requirements. Tanzania is 100% dependent on hydroelectric power, they have continuous rolling blackouts What NI should be building is gas fired combined cycle plants plants. When NI finally figures out this is a bad idea, I will submit my resume to become the CEO, I can make equally poor decisions for a lot less money."

"Investors don't like FUD. Ni Stock price will continue it's downward trend. As the price continues to slide, more and more investors will head for the exits, moving cash to safer investments.As far as the question of liability insurance: Not that the news can be trusted, many outlets have reported that NI was purported to be aware that there were issues in the pipeline. Literally. They knew there were problems, and they failed to act. I do not think that deliberate negligence is covered by liability insurance. Good luck collecting on that claim. No matter what - too much uncertainty. NI will continue to dip. Buy puts."

I say will continue to go down in price....Just like what happened to PCG (PG & E )....takes about 10 days for law suits to really start being served....Buying October and April Puts....Just my thought....

Among the unveilings expected there will be Nio's second electric sedan, the anticipated ET5 (which Fang expects to be comparable to a Tesla Model 3).Profits should grow nicely as well, especially thanks to the ET7, which Fang points out is expected to be ""China's priciest car model launched by a domestic brand."""

The rate case and settlement needed to be withdrawn so the Governor of Massachusetts can write a check to cover the costs of the replacement of the old pipes with new pipes and whip his nay-saying regulators into shape. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/columbia-gas-of-massachusetts-withdrawing-pending-rate-case-300715644.html
"According to their Proxy statement, the CEO has a base salary of 975,000 with incentives up to $5,000,000. The main responsibility of a gas utility is to provide gas safely and the company utterly failed on this. Probably too much emphasis on rate increases, financial engineering and executive compensation and not enough of customer safety. If the regulators are going to do their job then they should require a complete safety overall before allowing any executive bonuses or dividends."

"HOUSTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A NiSource Inc affiliate's construction work led to overpressured natural-gas distribution lines tied to explosions in Massachusetts that killed one person and injured 21, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report released on Thursday.Crews were working for Columbia Gas of Massachusetts on a pipe-replacement project in Lawrence, a city northwest of Boston, when pressure regulators opened, sending gas at high pressure into homes and businesses.

(NI), parent company of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, today released the following statement on the release of the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) preliminary report regarding the Greater Lawrence area gas incident that occurred on September 13, 2018:""Today the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the independent Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating pipeline accidents, issued its preliminary report regarding the events of September 13th. The company is fully cooperating with the NTSB and provided information to assist in its ongoing investigation into relevant facts related to the event, the probable cause, and its development of safety recommendations.""As a party to the NTSB investigation, we are prohibited from discussing or speculating on the cause of the incident or facts related to it until the NTSB has completed its work. However, we can say that, because safety is our top priority, in the hours immediately after the incident we suspended similar work and enhanced procedures related to our low pressure systems. We saw these as responsible steps to take in the aftermath of the incident and while the facts were being gathered.""As we have said before, we remain focused on three key areas: Taking Care of People: We continue to work with state and local leaders and a broad network of community partners to meet the needs of the people affected by this incident and to keep them fully informed as the recovery effort moves forward. Ensuring Safety: All of our actions are driven by our commitment to the safety of our customers, our communities and our employees. Regaining Trust: We are working to restore gas service as quickly as possible and are committed to taking the steps needed to re-earn the trust of our customers, communities, and public officials."
