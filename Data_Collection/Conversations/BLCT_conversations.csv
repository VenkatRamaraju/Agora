"@BigWilly It's not a secret and the info has been there pre-ipo. https://ir.blue-city.com/corporate-governance/managementI think a Chairman with this sort of background and CTO from baidu is appealing. China has become much more accepting of the LBGQT community, and they also understand they are a revenue stream. The biggest threat to BLCT and any tradeable chinese company is the CCP policies. I think the founder's background will be good for BLCT to a degree and this is a portal and resource platform company, not a gaming or storage company.High Risk High Reward here. At this price point, this could double easily once regulations settle down and they continue to show user and revenue growth. Google Play shows it has a high amount of downloads, and reading the reviews, a global user base."
"At the Deutsch Bank virtual conference, the CFO suggested they will be profitable in Q3 2021 or in about 12 months time. Right now they are focusing on growing monetisation on their platform. So I will want to see $41 million or more revs in the coming report on Dec 2nd to show that monetisation efforts are tracking strongly."

"Started a position yesterday, avg down to 3.72 today. Short selling has been over 1/2 of the daily volume for the entire week, short borrowing fee is at 2.6%. Won't take much of a catalyst for a good bounce with this kind of volume and short interest. If JD, BABA, PDD have another pop up this will ride back to mid $4s."
I am in!
"Besides the many class action lawsuits, what's keeping this stock down? Is it a China thing? Am I missing something?"
"Great earnings report, stock is down. Am I missing something?"
What are your thoughts on the Class Action suit? Anyone?

"Can anyone explain to me the ""preferred shares"". Is this possibly dilutive to the outstanding ordinary shares?"
BlueCity reached an all time low at 2.70
Nice Results - Time to buy? Quarterly Rev of $45.2m - (annual $180m) - market cap today $160m - Plenty of cash to cover current losses. Quarterly paying users increased by 58% over last year.
big disappointment... will this ever recover? Many bag holders at over $25/share.
"Up on very heavy volume, just a pop, then drop......we'll see...."
"It seems drew a solid floor at 8-9$. I bought yesterday 200 at 10.00$. I think this stock has future. No discos, no pubs, no karaokes.. People will keep meeting persons using this app after confinament. I trust the asian Grindr. Of course. Only remains that Bluecity make money with the membership of Blued, Lesdo and other companies that buy in the future. Greetings from Spain!"
I'm in!
BOOM
What is happening with this it’s been dropping every day
"Managed to unload at 3.58 yesterday. It was a small short squeeze with little legs for volume and it still moved it up 25%. I'll continue to do swing trades on this. Available shares to short is nearing 1million, borrow rate is over 2%. $BLCT is wound tight for a high volume squeeze in the right conditions. Lots of stop losses at $4 and $5"
