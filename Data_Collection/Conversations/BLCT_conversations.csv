"Started a position yesterday, avg down to 3.72 today. Short selling has been over 1/2 of the daily volume for the entire week, short borrowing fee is at 2.6%. Won't take much of a catalyst for a good bounce with this kind of volume and short interest. If JD, BABA, PDD have another pop up this will ride back to mid $4s."
"@BigWilly It's not a secret and the info has been there pre-ipo. https://ir.blue-city.com/corporate-governance/managementI think a Chairman with this sort of background and CTO from baidu is appealing. China has become much more accepting of the LBGQT community, and they also understand they are a revenue stream. The biggest threat to BLCT and any tradeable chinese company is the CCP policies. I think the founder's background will be good for BLCT to a degree and this is a portal and resource platform company, not a gaming or storage company.High Risk High Reward here. At this price point, this could double easily once regulations settle down and they continue to show user and revenue growth. Google Play shows it has a high amount of downloads, and reading the reviews, a global user base."

"Biggest scam ever. Waiting for so long for an opportunity to jump out. Mr Baoli Ma founder and chairman and who served as director and chief executive officer, an ex deputy director of information research at Qinhuangdao Public Security Bureau???? Also he studied public security in Qinhuangdao People's Police School from 1992 to 1996??? Public security management in Chinese People's Armed Police Force Academy from 2002 to 2003??? With a bachelor of laws degree in public security management from People's Public Security University of China??? In a homophobic country like China??? I got this info too late unfortunately and it smells like scam"

Garbage
Nice Results - Time to buy? Quarterly Rev of $45.2m - (annual $180m) - market cap today $160m - Plenty of cash to cover current losses. Quarterly paying users increased by 58% over last year.
the earning came out is great. but the stock still drop a lot. Why
"How undervalued is BLCT?MTCH has 15.6x more quarterly revenue of BLCTMTCH is valued 100x greater than BLCTBLCT is trending at 150 million in 2020 revs, stock is trading 2.25x sales which for a software growth should be a minimum of 5x sales valuation. Software growth companies generally have a 10x sales valuation.BLCT has about as many users as GrindrGrindr is a private company bought by a VC firm for $608 million in March 2020 at 1.7x current valuation of BLCTGrindr estimate is that they're IPO price would put their market cap at $2 billion+, or 1/17th valuation of Match Group and 6x valuation of BLCTIt all depends on the revenues on Q3 report. If they hit $41 million or higher, the only path is up."
BLCT is down 14.13% to 15.28
"Revs for Q3 were strong, but guidance for Q4 revs was weak. This is the reason for the poor earnings reaction."
BlueCity is up 8.80% to 3.88

"It seems drew a solid floor at 8-9$. I bought yesterday 200 at 10.00$. I think this stock has future. No discos, no pubs, no karaokes.. People will keep meeting persons using this app after confinament. I trust the asian Grindr. Of course. Only remains that Bluecity make money with the membership of Blued, Lesdo and other companies that buy in the future. Greetings from Spain!"
"Managed to unload at 3.58 yesterday. It was a small short squeeze with little legs for volume and it still moved it up 25%. I'll continue to do swing trades on this. Available shares to short is nearing 1million, borrow rate is over 2%. $BLCT is wound tight for a high volume squeeze in the right conditions. Lots of stop losses at $4 and $5"
BLCT reached an all time low at 10.48
I'm looking for $41 million in revs for Q3 or about 20% increase from Q2. Company is tracking at $150 million in Revs for the fiscal year so it's trading about 2.25 x 2020 sales which seems like an extreme discount even for a Chinese company. Post earnings I will be:Bullish if sales hit $41 million or higher.Neutral if $39-$40 million.Bearish if < $39 million

"Buy, Sell, Hold... that is the question."
"At the Deutsch Bank virtual conference, the CFO suggested they will be profitable in Q3 2021 or in about 12 months time. Right now they are focusing on growing monetisation on their platform. So I will want to see $41 million or more revs in the coming report on Dec 2nd to show that monetisation efforts are tracking strongly."

What are your thoughts on the Class Action suit? Anyone?
BLCT reached an all time low at 12.90
Gonna go off
Looking at the accounts the level of losses sustained in the quarter at $20.3 M is not encouraging. However if the GAAP adjusted figure is reliable then the Company is on track to reach profitability by this time next year. Hopefully when investors take note of this the share price will increase.
