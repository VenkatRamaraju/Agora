TDC is an amazing opportunity and most certainly underpriced. Had very good earnings and I am envisioning this stock trading at $70 soon therefore I am accumulating TDC shares for the long run.
just got upgraded but price target only 55 maybe that’s why the sell off ?
Earnings call will be a home run. 30-35 by mid feb
TDC about to test the all time high!
Is there any news on this 10 percent drop?
"You can buy $SNOW at 110xs sales and $100B market or buy competitor $TDC, an established company at 2.8 p/s, >$400m FCF, and a $5B market that makes $2B rev per year compared to $800 mil for Snow. Once the market realizes this, this thing will soar. Its a >$300/share stock."
Compare TDC positive EBITDA with SNOW negative EBITDA and then compare the price between the 2
"MT Newswire (6:32 a.m.) reported for fiscal 2022, the company said adjusted earnings would be the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Analysts surveyed by Capital IQ have been expecting $1.92 per share.That's the only sense I can make of the drop"

This is a sign it will skyrocket as whales shake out weak hands - this what happens when there is no news
"TDC has 92 RS and it will go up really fast, $47 we are seeing today is cheap. Also compare to Snowflake"
Buying opportunity when it drops like this. Shake out some holders and strap in for the next rise to $70+
The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share for fiscal 2022. Analysts are expecting $1.92 per share.
Busting out on big volume!
just fell below 5 day moving average time to buy!
"Smashing result and only time will tell if results move the SP. But investing in a company with strong fundamentals, winning new customers with a proven product is a no brainer."
"Cloud/data company that actually makes money and is still reasonably priced. $4B market cap, 2.4 price to sales and a ~30 p/e. Just look at what $MDB did since 2018, TDC could do something similar."
New analyst report upgrades buy rating to $88 citing market dominance and huge cloud growth. Certainly an investment on the rise
Going to break out of the dip soon. If it was valued the same as SNOW it would be at $155 which is my price target
hasn't been this high in 8 years....ascending channel
