dump hasn't even happened yet. just wait.
"You can buy $SNOW at 110xs sales and $100B market or buy competitor $TDC, an established company at 2.8 p/s, >$400m FCF, and a $5B market that makes $2B rev per year compared to $800 mil for Snow. Once the market realizes this, this thing will soar. Its a >$300/share stock."
TDC is going to make a very interesting announcement in a few weeks...
https://discord.gg/x85VEVu
TDC reached a new 52 Week High at 43.77
no revenue growth. This company is dead by 2025.
Up Najarian highlighted unusual action in June & July call options .
shorts .... Ouch
bought some shares on the dip...any thoughts as what happened to cause the dip?...overbought?...insider selling ?...can't believe one analyst caused dip like this.
What is going on with over 20% gain in the last 24 hours?
"TDC is sp stock, AH, and on Monday shorts start covering and we will see TDC in mid-forties. Earning was absolutely Great.GLK"
JP Morgan valuation at $70 and $155 price target at SNOW’s valuation. You’d be stupid not to be bullish on this.
"Guys, don’t think to sell it now. This is just a start for a great run. They are growing rapidly in cloud revenues. Analysts wanted to see this quarter after last earnings and they couldn’t have expected more. Therefore, share are not going to give back gains this time. $TDC is easily a 20B company in couple of years i. e. PPS over $200I would be adding more todayWay not more to go $$"
You all see TDC has 32% Short Interest on Float?
Breaking down. Pre earning is not the same as reported earnings. 44-45 close
How high is this going? Asking for a friend
Great run sold mine in ah. Maybe consider buying in the 40s again
bullish 30
Leroy have a coffee at McDonald's
wash and rinse the weak hands today by filling the gap.
it was fun but this is done.
$2.00 plus bounce at market open imho
Is there any news on this 10 percent drop?
nice blowout quarter!
TDC is down -4.92% to 37.90
Looks like the stock found its footing. The news is too good here for it not to. This changes everything. TDC has gone from slow decline to growth company. It is in the same category as SNOW.
just fell below 5 day moving average time to buy!
"From CFRA, maintaining their ""buy"" opinion on TDC at 2:45p today: ""Shares are up today on an unconfirmed article from Reorg stating there could be potential takeover interest for TDC. We think recent M&A chatter is partially attributed to recent news flow around fellow competitor, Cloudera (CLDR 12 NR), which spiked higher earlier this week, as the company cited it held discussions with several potential acquirers, including private equity firms. We see some validity in the speculation for TDC, given the recent stretch of mixed quarters, prompted by its plan to pivot towards subscription-based cloud services. We also think TDC's balance sheet capacity (net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.9x) and lagging segments (e.g., consulting) could be potential levers to create value in a privately-held company setting. We maintain our Buy rating on shares, on the belief that TDC's growing pains are reflected in the multiple (12.7x our '21 EPS view), and upside exists, as investors fixate on near-term risk, despite the longer-term strategy remaining intact."""
"Another example of a stock that needs to retest lows before it can go higher, especially if one thinks it will go higher before earnings."
What could this go to after earnings report may 6th?
Glad to see this company finally getting some respect. New management has a good grasp on increasing their subscription model and there is a big positive surprise coming before next Earnings report. Long TDC since $24.
Looks a short squeeze..
The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share for fiscal 2022. Analysts are expecting $1.92 per share.
"Really, short vovering took it too high this morning. Many were caught off guard with the pre announcement. Reality is that ensuing quarters still need to perform. Stock only deserves 10%"
Busting out on big volume!
TDC is selling lest than three times sales at around 50. SNOW is selling at over 50 times sales at around 230.TDC should be around 800 @ similar valuation. Do your own dd...; its a steal at this price...
TDC is down -4.98% to 38.01
"Earnings beat, revenues up, this looks like an opportunity. I'll be adding..."
"Can anybody explain, other than just pure short manipulation, the drop of 13% in share price after this latest ER? Can anybody name one thing in the ER that is not positive?"
WHERE YOU Gonna Park $OME of those huge Gains..? A GOLD-backed Cryptocurrency Stock UP 25 % yesterday...???
TDC had a great quarter and the cloud business is growing and very promising. Hoping on some volume today to bring the stock price up and get rid of the short attack that went on after hours.
"THIS BOARD NEEDS TO BE FIRED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS:Workforce Reduction PlanOn November 11, 2019, the Company approved a plan to reduce its workforce. This plan, which is incremental to Teradata’s comprehensive business transformation discussed in Note 15, is intended to reduce costs and increase efficiencies in certain of the Company’s operations. The Company expects that it will incur cost and cash expenditures in the range of $20 to $25 million related to the plan, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee-related cash expenditures.Approximately half of these cash expenditures, which relate to cash payments for its international employees, will not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) due to the Company accounting for its International postemployment benefits under Accounting Standards Codification 712, Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits (“ASC 712”), which uses actuarial estimates and defers the immediate recognition of gains or losses. The Company expects these actions will be substantially completed by the first half of 2020."
"just say ""cloud""....triple company value!"
Will cover when it crashes back down. No sane person is buying at these prices.
* Teradata Corp : Citigroup raises price target to $59 from $53* Teradata Corp : Cowen and Company raises target price to $43 from $40* Teradata Corp : Barclays raises target price to $38 from $27* Teradata Corp : RBC raises target price to $50 from $45
"Beat on the top and bottom line, raised next quarter guidance. Actually makes money, and what happens, goes down. I'll wait to see what happens for a few days but it appears that when you are not one of the cool stocks, you don't feel the love. Crazy stuff."
Very good results considering the market and the stock is a bargain. Time to rinse and repeat as I bought this stock at this price in 2016 and sold at $48.
"After many days of unexplainable manipulation TDC is now on sale, It’s a bargain."
Looks like the short squeeze is upon us!
"Sales are so great there were major layoffs Monday 1/7/19. Pre-sales teams, consultants, technical, senior managers, etc. 20-25% U.S. and international. I guess no one wants to buy the turkey, so it slowly proceeds down the tubes. Thinkbig renamed to Thinknot."
The classic rise before the fall 
This stock should be at solid $85 at least. Am talking about pure performance with no speculation or bubble included. With current market casino staying with this stock is the safest bet i can find. Look at snowflake and lptr or other sw companies they are so jacked up
Board needs to be replaced and get a CEO instead of a tired grocery clerk
Blowout quarter. Not selling off this time. May end up like SNOW when it was $400+ a share.
$TDC Upgraded by JMP Securities Market Perform » Outperform USD 70

"Sumo logic will be next one, I know the company and it s doing quite impressive"
TDC is up 4.97% to 39.91
TDC is down -4.91% to 38.31
About 12% of the float is short...big squeeze coming tomorrow morning... TDC could go to 100 ?
"longs, take profits and buy back later at 45"
Boom! 5% jump today. Thanks for the easy money.
Massive drop after hours?
What is the short position % and investor ownership % in this stock? Institutions seems to hold most stock.
why is it down 6% today..can't find any news...
"lots of profit taking, this is priced at $70 buy big guys, it will burst soon, good chance to buy on dip guys"
"Looks like run is over, on the way down to settle... prob around $40-"
TD 2021 Q1 revenue = $491mTD 2011 Q1 revenue = $506mHow horrible.
For everyone panicking about the -5.99% after hours drop it a sale of 1 share by a bot meant to distort the price. Check Nasdaq to see for yourself
Closes at 45. Its all short covering
7 times normal vol today. That's a response to new CEO and his plans.
Excellent time to buy more under $50 !!
HELLO TO MELVIN CAPITAL!
"It is just dead. Stock is dead and so is the company. It has been 6 years since it was doing well. The board changed out the management team that knew what they were doing and put the ""Rat"" in the job. The board needs replaced."
https://discord.gg/2F6sr58
I buy back after profit taking around 33
Never chase a peak stock
"I need to load up on this cloud amazing undervalued company before all the big banks get in. This is gold! I regret selling some on Friday, I did a lot of work this weekend only to find out that I was wrong to sell 80% of my position last Friday. Oh well we all make mistakes. But I'm back in and adding!"
"Earning beat and good forecast, why stock down 18%?"
"Still short 48, will probably cover at 20 in June, 50K shares."
TDC is up 4.93% to 41.11
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Fairstox.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
$39 in pre market $46 within 5 min of open And now .. yawn pinned at $42 for an hour Who is the F is the market maker here ?? lol
This is a sign it will skyrocket as whales shake out weak hands - this what happens when there is no news
"Thankyou for another great trading day. Another surge on this stock. Strong fundamentals, huge upside, leader in its market. This will go higher."
Pre market is looking good for another strong day. Get in early with the buys as this thing will hit $60 EOD
This will go to $60 in a couple of days.
anybody buying nothing drop?
"This is like what happened to TTD ... Once it popped on good earnings and guidance, it never looked back on its way to be a 20-bagger. Pops like these takes 3 days for shorts to panic and cover."
I think it delayed response to new CEO and his plans for company .
Great earnings AGAIN
This stock is heavily shorted by Hedge funds. This is why we see these big swings.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
this is tanking
TDC is up 4.91% to $38.22
Spending money like crazy and revenue and profits down while laying off good people. But management thinks they are cool running around in orange tennis shoes. Get your eyes on the business people.
How much do you guys think it will rise to before opening tomorrow?
So now TD has a strategy that CEO Vic endorses. He also endorsed all the other strategies the business has executed since 2007 and was part of the failed performance of the business the last 3 years. Why should we believe him now just because he is a CEO who moved from the Board of the same company. If he sees double digit growth as promised it will be at much lower margins since the so called new businesses are cloud based solutions. He may be proud that most of the management has been forced out or left on their own but that management group built the business from nothing to one of the most successful businesses in data analytics. Maybe it's time for a new board.
"Mystery company. No competition from the Blue Chip as the DW/analytics market is too narrow to justify a profit center. As a consequence TD owns like a monopoly position inside his Customers (who can't switch to competition). Business model switched classically from hardware to maintenance services to guarantee smooth life and lack of development. Management happy with strange and unique strategy, shares stable in time. King kingdom of nothing new but zen"
GCP just took one of TD largest customers. Snow took many in the last quarter. TD is dying.
"Beat revenue expectations, beat EPS. They announced a lot of new customers in Q1. The market leader is continuing to beat all expectations"
Teradata is very expensive to support compare to Oracle
TDC is an amazing opportunity and most certainly underpriced. Had very good earnings and I am envisioning this stock trading at $70 soon therefore I am accumulating TDC shares for the long run.
better look at SUMO
TDC reached a new 52 Week High at 42.53
"i am buying more, this stock is rock solid in performance. no speculation at all and it was dumped like crazy! other stock like sxxt but skyrocketed everyday. people are playing casino style, no more traditional trading"
https://discord.gg/DtnS3rFb
Looking like an entry point here. 12% is an oversold condition
Teradata's list of customers is impressive: https://www.teradata.com/CustomersUnder $23 is a great place to initiate a half of a position.
"This will obviously increase up to earnings and over the course of this year. Increasing number of new customers into cloud, market leader with a lean business model. Their customers are the large enterprises who are spending up big post covid."
"Herd buy, bubble here"
Snow flakes are going to melt today at 1pm
careful fellas
"It’s too erly to assume the results will continue in the coming quarters. The $45 taget upgrade suggests it’s overbought for rhe rest of the year. I like ot at 40, for now it’s a prime short."
This opens above 60 in morning.
"tom and dangermaus, how did you guys stumble upon this"
Tomorrow it will go up much more! I have been holding and accumulating! And I can see this stock at $70+
"Market retailers have just been scared What does senate voting on the stimulus today will be a pass , thus markets up next week"
Only shorts are buying at this price.
"Nice, been a long time since I had a big gainer like this. Probably would have had some last year but I stupidly exited my stocks in March 2020 due to the pandemic and just begrudgingly started getting back in sometime during the fall during a little dip in the. I sold half my TDC premarket and will let the other half ride. It's still a good value based on the metric I like to use, enterprise value to gross annual profits. I had an incredible run in 2003-2004 using that metric on depressed tech stocks, and that strategy has worked a bit once again in the last half year."
TDC is down -5.01% to 38.09
Teradata reached a 52 Week high at 27.84
"I was waiting for this dip caused by a sham article today thanks, earnings will be epic again coming soon !"
TDC reached a new 52 Week High at 39.92
"I would recommend holding your positions for this one and buying at the dip, because this week the entire market has been at a low, including all the indexes, even all the high performing stocks of last week, so it will get back to its momentum, but right now would be a good time to buy in my opinion."
wow
TDC reached a 52 Week low at 22.52
SELB and ALTO huge upgrades
"Nice news today, hoping for a good pop soon."
Expecting a big rise tomorrow. Investors are fleeing other tech stocks and looking for undervalued stocks. Remember the analysts are still saying TDC is 40-60% undervalued.
"I'm adding on this pullback. I like the company, it's products and the management team."
you would think it would move slowly upward in the next few weeks.. A lot of call option buying for June
Going to break out of the dip soon. If it was valued the same as SNOW it would be at $155 which is my price target
Wow..should’ve sold yesterday after hours
"longs - what's your plan? you rode this all the way up, didnt take profits, and plan to ride it all the way back down?"
TDC $70 by end of March <3
"TDC has 92 RS and it will go up really fast, $47 we are seeing today is cheap. Also compare to Snowflake"
TDC rated strong buy by 5/5 analysts https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tdc/analyst-research
"Doubled down at market close, it’s normal for stocks to take a big dip after a huge rise"
what happened ??...any thoughts
Teradata is down 7.62% to 21.83
Wow!! Sure wish I had known about TDC a couple weeks ago!Congrats to all who were in this.
TDC making a bid for CLDR? I've heard they are throwing their hat into the ring. Buying for the customer list is certainly an interesting play.
Great results! Look at the after hours trading. It's on the rise.
TDC upgraded to 67 at Bank of America
Great earnings…..again!
Current TDC position is less than previous close of about $2 but it says Plus next to the stock price. Am I not understanding this presentation OR representation is incorrect to previous close to current number in finance.yahoo.com
"Looks like a massive expected earnings beat is driving the stock up huge. GAAP earnings for the quarter of between 45 cents and 47 cents a share whereas the previous guidance range was 11 cents to 13 cents.Unfortunately, I was waiting to increase the position size and missed it. Congratulations to those who bought in."
New analyst report upgrades buy rating to $88 citing market dominance and huge cloud growth. Certainly an investment on the rise
"$TDC Should be way up, not down https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teradata-tdc-q1-earnings-beat-124312379.html"
Interesting thoughts on Teradata from Tom.
Nice upgrade
Very impressive earnings call. After market looks healthy. This is going to rocket up tomorrow
JPM ups target price to $78.
"I’ve been watching this company for ages now trying to gauge my sentiment on it. After this earning miss and taking another critical look at the company and what it offers, I think one of the biggest thing it needs is a total marketing overhaul. They seem to be in this awkward stage of being in the right place at the wrong time; competing with Facebook and google in the data sector. Thoughts?"
I bought in yesterday and I am up $20 TDC is going to the moon! Stay long!!
I'm bullish on TDC but wondering why it's eerily quiet now it has dropped south in the last couple weeks....you can hear crickets on this message board...which to me is kinda concerning....but what do I know
"I'm @ 2,500 June 25 calls"
check 2 stocks got upgrade i mean huge upgrades ALTO and SELB
Earnings call will be a home run. 30-35 by mid feb
TDC about to test the all time high!
just got upgraded but price target only 55 maybe that’s why the sell off ?
Great end to the week. Up on all fronts with a lot more movement in the coming weeks. The trajectory is going in the right direction and I can't stop buying enough of TDC at the moment as long term it'll be rock solid
"Cloud/data company that actually makes money and is still reasonably priced. $4B market cap, 2.4 price to sales and a ~30 p/e. Just look at what $MDB did since 2018, TDC could do something similar."
What’s going on with stock when it seems all good
"If there really were serious buyout talks with Google going on, it wouldn't have been so cheap for me to buy Jan 30 call options for 20 cents"
"Now the previous close is reflecting at $32.99 for the first time today. That means as of now it was not represented correctly, right?"
Compare TDC positive EBITDA with SNOW negative EBITDA and then compare the price between the 2
"Earnings pop already happened ... on the day of earnings, it will be sell the news ... going back down to $35 where it belongs"
Strap in and enjoy the ride today. Loaded up my buys and ready to watch this go up and up
Great run. Taking profits here by trimming 75%
Vic Lund the 80 year old foul mouth showed his true colors when commenting to the press about TD us back comment. Any exec who has to use foul language to get their message across is a poor leader. Vic baby seems to forget he was on the Board an participated and approved the strategic direction of TD. Now he and his buddy Oliver Rat can only blame prior management for his failed quarter. Oliver would not have a job if it wasnt for prior management.
this is what you get for earning beat and good forecast? I can't imagine where this stock would be right now if it were to report bad earning and bad forecast last week?
"back up to 59, great company with a true niche"
"This is an investment, not a trade, buying every pullback under 50..."
Look for stock offering (dilution) news after the bell. Tomorrow it opens at 40.
"It’s not their marketing, it’s their execution. Moving to a subscription model as quickly as they have sacrificed revenues and profits. This is all water under the bridge and profits plus earnings consistency will be better next year. A new CEO will help too but the transition over the next 6-8 months will be a bit shaky. With this said, chaos offers opportunities."
PT $45 issued today which is 1 year out target.. Sell up here
https://siliconangle.com/2021/06/05/chasing-snowflakes-new-database-boomtown/
Nice announcement on hertz. Another example of large scale customers flocking to TDC in the cloud. No wonder cloud growth is 160%
"At $.70-$.75 / share in earning , you looking at a p/e of ONLY 15$75-$90 stock in 2021"
TDC has over 8 million shares short; shorts covered less that half million shares less night at a price as high as 58. This could go to over 100 today if longs resist selling at such a low price. Just hold and watch it go up...
Buying opportunity when it drops like this. Shake out some holders and strap in for the next rise to $70+
what happened? any ideas?
"take your profits/loss now. if you like the stock, buy back later. dont say I didnt tell you so."
Lot of short still hanging on... This is going much higher...
The company competes in the same industry as Snowflake and can't seem to get a sniff. Are their cloud solutions really that bad or is it confusion as long term transition to SaaS and consulting services continues?
Finally got rid of the problem Vic Lund. He was a grocery store clerk at best and ran Teradata into the ground. He said this is the best team of executives he has seen in 20 years. That's the problem. He was on the board giving direction for 20 years. He wouldn't know the best team if it was right in front of his face.
bullish 40
"MT Newswire (6:32 a.m.) reported for fiscal 2022, the company said adjusted earnings would be the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Analysts surveyed by Capital IQ have been expecting $1.92 per share.That's the only sense I can make of the drop"
take profits. we all know this is going back down.
Oh no
"Smashing result and only time will tell if results move the SP. But investing in a company with strong fundamentals, winning new customers with a proven product is a no brainer."
"They are hiding the Bid size, there are an inordinate amount of shorts trying to cover"
Ok that is two quarter the so called CEO Oliver Rat has missed. Mr. Lund obviously picked the wrong guy. They will never make up the revenue decline on the loss hardware sales and hardware maintenance through their ARR model. This puppy is getting a big reset and their ARR growth will never experience the growth they had when the real management team made the company what it was regardless of what Oliver Rat tries to blame his problems with results on them.
Hoping to see $60 by 2/19
