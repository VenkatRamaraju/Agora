Is everyone buying this stock for the dividend ? The Financials seem to be slightly trending lower year over year for the last 3 years. Nothing earth shattering but still lower. The TTM is also edging slightly lower.

"$MSM saw some long-awaited price leverage, but the organic growth rate seems light compared to its multiyear highs. Hiring more reps should help MSC Industrial, but the risk remains that price transparency and online competition have whittled away its competitive advantage. https://www.finstead.com/bite/MSC-Industrial-Direct-MSM-earnings-estimates-june-30-2018"

"If the Trump Infrastructure Plan get implemented MSM will profit tremendously. IMO I see MSM hitting its 3 year high of $102.76. As Dividends are at 4.23% currently based on today’s stock price (quarterly dividend at .75, yearly of $3.00) with payout ratio between 50-60%, Dividend increases will likely continue. Per last dividend increase of 19.04%, If MSN matched it most recent dividend increase of 19.04%, next dividend raise would be upward of .89/quarter or $3.57/ year. I believe it will continue.

"I got out of most everything in 2008, above DOW 13,000Then I watched the #MSM and Dems panic DOW down to 6308 intraday in March 2009They're doing it again, and it's mostly political. FAANG was overpriced, but there isn't widespread bank failure, the Trade War is overblown, and economic fundamentals are good.There will be great buying opportunities when they are done."
