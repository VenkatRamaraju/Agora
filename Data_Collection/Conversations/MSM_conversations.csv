Not a lot of love for this undervalued company... I'm long building a position form this point forward.. Dividends will grow......
"NOW IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE RLF TO THE WORLD, TO THE PUBLIC, TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY! WE BLEW PLAST SECOND HURDLE WITH FLYING COLORS 7-0! START SAVING LIVES #REALMEDIA #NOYOUTUBE #MSM"
"Infrastructure bill coming soon, going to President Trump desk and all indications he will sign. That is great for the US and MSM - will be $75 soon."
"Someone bought 212,000 shares right at close to catch ex-div date￼. They now use the dividend money to buy back the stock and ride it back to $76￼"
This thing drops like a rock daily. I wonder where the bottom is for this one?
Exec thinks something big happening purchased 5mm dollars worth of stock WOW
Could we see a special Div announced shortly? Q3 results next week.
"I just don’t understand. Great ER, drops 6%. I bought more "
I am thinking infrastructure play. I saw the announcement of the insider purchase and jumped on this.
"If the Trump Infrastructure Plan get implemented MSM will profit tremendously. IMO I see MSM hitting its 3 year high of $102.76. As Dividends are at 4.23% currently based on today’s stock price (quarterly dividend at .75, yearly of $3.00) with payout ratio between 50-60%, Dividend increases will likely continue. Per last dividend increase of 19.04%, If MSN matched it most recent dividend increase of 19.04%, next dividend raise would be upward of .89/quarter or $3.57/ year. I believe it will continue.

Great buying opportunity! Come in right after dividend effect and get this stock at bargain prices!
Currrently @ 74.75. Where will this be after the dividend. It has been in a downward trend since the start of the year.
Stumbled upon this idea from Barron's. Neat company. Watch list for now.
Looks like a nice near team bottom. Nice $5.75 dividend coming up.
Looking for info on the next ex div date. Should be right about now. Last was 7/12. This stock took a hit and is down 10%. If Joes infrastructure bill passes it may see a bump.
Insider bought over $1M in this company. This hit the news at 1:20 - explaining the sharp rise
When will $MSM pay dividend next? No declaration for October yet :(.
With the special dividend coming up and the decent ten year dividends definitely a buy for me!
"Great company with committed people, just can’t move the stock. Not sure why"
