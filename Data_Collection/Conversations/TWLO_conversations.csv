"Revenue $740million in quarter , way above analyst estimates. Guiding to $760-770 next quarter! hoping conference call goes well, and we see analyst upgrades."
"For once u have to agree with the market reaction .. if you do a run rate of 3 billion and growing at 30% plus .. but u refuse to explain how TWLO will manage these massive losses, lose your coo then this reaction is logical .. if u can’t make money doing three billion in software then maybe, just maybe u may be doing something wrong .. not selling here but this kind of ER will not brighten the mood, right ?"
strong beat and raise.the company yet again pulled off a beat on top and bottom lines and guided to stronger than expected revenues for the fourth quarter.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3759432-twilio-slips-8-after-q3-beat-with-surprise-profit?utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&utm_term=RTA+News+Smart
Saw the CNBC guys talk about this getting hammered this week. Good place to start a position?
TWLO will be green before the close today. Look at the charts! Like this post and make it a top reaction so others will benefit too!
"Nice opportunity to buy the dip on a long term secular winnerTwilio price target lowered to $450 from $525 at Wells Fargo, overweightTwilio reiterated overweight with a $420 price target at Morgan StanleyTwilio price target lowered to $400 from $460 at Needham, BUYTwilio price target lowered to $390 from $450 at Baird, outperformTwilio price target lowered to $375 from $430 at Mizuho, BUY"
Buy the dip in V instead. I heard that company makes money.
"Why is this called earnings, when the company is reporting record losses each quarter? Founded 13 years ago, and still chasing only the growth pattern by making debts. Tesla started to make money after 10 years, I can't see this here in the next 5 years."
"I couldn't be happier that I found https://dailytrading.tools/Trade-of-the-Week . In the market, every trader needs an edge. Trade Ideas is my edge because it is fast, accurate and flexible. It helps me increase my profitability by quickly finding stocks that are moving and lists them in a way that allows me to decide which one I want to trade."
"sheesh - did ANYONE here listen to the call or read the call transcript?? I did... word for word. There really was no “warning” given.... said they were comfortable with growth in the 30% range... that margins may be a bit compressed due to investments being made in the business and were generally positive. analysts were/are concerned with apparent slowing organic growth... I think that’s why the stock took a hit today....but still a huge runway of opportunity in front of them. if you’re investing your hard earned money in a stock, do some DD vs just complaining about things. From my perspective, this pull back looked healthy and resets trajectories perfectly for a year or two out. They beat on top line by a wide margin, guided higher for Q4... and continue to pump $ back into their growing business. Good grief people... Good luck to all.rainking"
"Let me get this straight. A $60 billion company, and yet they make no actual profits, never have, maybe never will? Ok then"
green this is gonna reach 300 easy again yall bashers are funny there’s literally nothing bad with this stock
"Analysts expected $680.2 million, Twilio reported $740 million. Great earnings! :)Sorry for the weak hands that will sell, it happened the same yesterday with GOOGL."
The company also said Chief Operating Officer George Hu is leaving
"NET has a market cap of $58B with 530M in revenue. SNOW's market cap is $103B with 850M in revenue. TWLO's market cap is $63B, with $2.25B in revenue. All three companies are not profitable, however TWLO guided their revenue higher. This is another Wall street overreaction. My sense is a hedge fund or two was short, and they exacerbated the selling in AH. TWLO will recover, and fast. I'm long TWLO in AH for the first time, and I expect to make a huge profit."
"buy the dip, sell off overdone. This is a great company and should be considered a high-quality growth stock. That’s how I look at Twilio.For Twilio, the company beat on the one thing that should matter, which is revenue growth. (It beat on earnings, too.) The company crushes estimates, guides conservatively on earnings and investors sell the stock regardless of the other positives which made 0 sense. Stock will come roaring back"
And with that dip I’ve taken a starter position. Dips attract new investors :)
"This morning I reminded myself that with TWLO, you're gonna get volatility, but the growth story is still merited and I believe in the long term opportunity. Although a drop like this hurts, I'm gritting my teeth and added to my position here @ #290. GLTA..."
"Just too many acquisitions, buying spree, is hitting the bottom line, although growth is there!"
"I can’t believe people get scared and sell an amazing Cloud communications company which has been delivering great results year after year. JP Morgan adjusted Twilio to $420 from $445 and maintains Overweight Rating as of 1 hour ago. Morgan Stanley adjusted Twilio price target to $420. From $445 and Wells Fargo adjusted their price target to $450. From $525so my question is, why do people fall for this games Wall Street firms play to scare them out of their money? conviction is everything!"
