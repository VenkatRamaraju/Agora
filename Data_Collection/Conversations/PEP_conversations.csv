I told you pep to $160.00 And pep did it.
Profit beat!Revenue beat!Guidance raised!The nutters on Wall Street will will surely sell PepsiCo but I will (as always) hold my shares and buy more when I can. PepsiCo is as good as it gets. I doubt I will ever sell a single share.

Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the PEP board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
Why you should buy Pepsi before KO.... like sodas are much more tastier from KO . Change my mind
Sure would be nice to see this split at least 2 for 1. yes I know the value would be the same but a lot easier to accumulated more shares. The dividend would also increase in the long run.
"Pepsi is not going to have a good quarter if what I'm seeing is widespread. . They have ignored their small to mid sized accounts.. They don't show up to the office, They don't listen to voice messages or return phone calls or answer the phones... Just my experience with the PEPSI in my neck of the woods.."
"Where did all these freaks come from and why are they obsessed with posting the number of shares they allegedly bought...multiple times today? The number of shares owned is meaningless to all, but the holder. % weight of a position? THAT is a relatable metric. For example, A/O 9/30/21, PEP represented 1.27% of my equity exposure.In a few days, I imagine all of the freaks will have moved on to their next target, but before they do, they may benefit by brushing up on Supply v Demand. (in other words, it's not always ""shorts""--YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"
Maybe stupid question but why Pep is 160 a KO is 50 ? I was thinking KO is stronger and bigger company. Am I missing something ? Any info for beginner please ? I can not figure it out... thank you

New Bern North Carolina Birthplace of Pepsi
PepsiCo reached an all time high at 161.77
Pepsi is up 13% over the last year. Good investment.
Remembering buying PEP in the mid 90’s… 700% capital guy today + 20% in divy on my initial investment… talking about a glorious investment. I made terrible investments back then but PEP largely compensates on its own…
Sold some covered call here due NOV $162.5.
