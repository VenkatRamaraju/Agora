"@Richard, if you're around, cheers to you! It's been a long summer!"

New customer count rising significantly and existing customer annual bet rising 20%plus. Margins going up and new NFT and advertising revenues will positively impact margins .Huge surprise might be small profit in Q2 2022.
Just in POTUS places bet. won't last 4 years
Wow no end of day selling for DKNG on a Friday!!!! Get ready for big moves next week. All the profit takers have left and people with strong conviction remain. VERY EXCITING!
Do not bet on sports. Bet on this stock! Odds much greater
Going live in Arizona this weekend! Letsss goooo!!
Still got 90 minutes to turn green
I heard about DKNG the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
The 60 calls have put the Kibosh on for today. Waiting for todays late drop to add more. Happy Happy making money to all you guys & gals....

DKNG commercials all over Arizona tv this weekend.. exciting
Up down up down… I mean this is positive that you can’t keep this stock down anymore
"We finally ended at 60 boys, this is big"

HFs at work
We’ll see $64 tomorrow!! IMO
"They just signed a deal with ultimate league frisbee. Really doesn’t sound like a needle move or calm one way or the other. However that is such a niche sport that the possibility definitely exists that because of that they will get new, unique gamblers. I wouldn’t expect this move to do anything except keep them going in the right direction. I definitely like winning dollars but win enough pennies and it’s the same thing"
That’s what I call a squeaking over $60.00
The golf was unbelievable !!!!!
Amazing close !
"accumulation is very healthy right now, next leg up to 64 range coming by weeks end….plus one week closer to NFL season starting#DKNG#NOBRAINER"
100%…..end of september new high
60 is still an awesome entry point into a company where the SP will undoubtably one day reach 200 plus dollars a share! No brainer hereI believe we will eventually see a 300 to 400 dollar per share price if they execute properly. I am betting they do :)
Today was turning point up.
Didn’t see this coming at the open
DKNG should be up 10% on this news. CEO speaks in 10 min.
I been holding bag for 5 months
Cheers!! The Oregon Lottery Commission voted to switch its mobile betting operator from Scoreboard to DraftKings
Stand back for Monday big open!
"If 3 buys 1, WOW! BetMGM buying Flutter/FanDuel would shock me... and it wouldn't. Things we know: 1. Online gambling is EXPLODING faster than expected and it's going to be BIGGER 2. Consolidation is happening 3. DKNG is a BEAST in this industry. #1 or 2 depending in who you ask. DKNG is going to get/keep a big piece of the pie. HOLD ON BOYZ!!! It's a helluva ride."
"3:02p ET 8/27/2021 - MarketWatchDraftKings stock jumps after winning Oregon's sports betting lottery. The Oregon Lottery Commission voted to switch its mobile betting operator from Scoreboard to DraftKings People in the state of Oregon are getting a new mobile sports betting provider. On Thursday, the Oregon Lottery Commission, which runs sports betting for the state, voted to switch its mobile betting operator from Scoreboard to DraftKings (DKNG). The Oregon Lottery Commission has only allowed one sports betting operator at a time to offer Oregonians mobile betting."
"By by scoreboard, DraftKings reigns supreme in Oregon! Get some!"
Not sure I fully understand the ESPN news. I hope Draft Kings doesnt agree to pay Disney for the use of the ESPN name. I think ESPN should be paying Draft Kings.
