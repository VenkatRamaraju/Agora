"Why is DKNG advertising in states that haven’t legalized online sports betting?Why are they marketing in California and Texas?Isn’t that a waste of money?By the time these states approve, everyone will be advertising. But what do I know?"
"So DKNG is ""up"" over 4% when the market is flat yet the shorts are trying to convince investors to sell.... FYI, no one is selling as this is well positioned for a slow steady increase."
I could easily see earnings being way better than the street thought and this thing rallying 8-9% AH.
"Found this on line- thoughts? Someone with a lot of money to spend (and possibly insider knowledge) has taken a bearish stance on DraftKings(NASDAQ:DKNG).And retail traders should know.We noticed this today when the big position showed up on publicly available options history that we track here at Benzinga.Whether this is an institution or just a wealthy individual, we don't know. But when something this big happens with DKNG, it often means somebody knows something is about to happen.Today, Benzinga's options scanner spotted 12 options trades for DraftKings.This isn't normal.The overall sentiment of these big-money traders is split between 25.0% bullish and 75.0%, bearish.Out of all of the options we uncovered, there was 1 put, for a total amount of $36,500, and 11, calls, for a total amount of $801,270.."
"48 was strong support before a big run up, strong support even after acquisition announcement, and is going to be the base post acquisition cancellation, back to mid 50s end of next week."

I think Robbins needs to make a bid for Amazon or Apple
Maybe smart to find stocks that benefit from all the gambling stocks together.
"Stop getting hung up on short term targets. Buy this stock, and wait 5 years."
"……this SHOULD be DKNG best earnings ever, if its not then this company will be taken out/bought…..by MGM or CAESARS…..thats just fact!"
"Daniel Politzer, writing from Wells Fargo, puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on DKNG, along with a $73 price target to imply a 56% upside for the next 12 months"
"What I really see in draftkings is the products it offers. Sports betting, NFT's, Igaming, and fantasy leagues/pools. I don't think any other sports betting platform offers all these products seamlessly. If there are competitors who offer ALL these products please let me know. The NFTs maybe a fad but every single one they have launched have sold out. The resale value for most of them are insanely high which DKNG also profits a % for resale. Excited for the earnings call next week!"
I bought the dip.
"Draft kings is not buying Entain!which Is a good thing, not diluting the shares￼￼￼. Stock up huge pre market!"
"so here are some numbers to think about...for the day today the money flow into the stock was positive againat 9 million and large scale orders were positive at 7 million. FOR THE WEEK, the money flow into the stock was positive at 16 million dollars and large scale orders were positive for the week at 30 million to the plus side...all thoughts welcome"
One good thing is the lower we go we lose less money for each 1 percent drop.
"This stock is on sale, Betting in the USA is only going to grow, I expect we will continue to see consolidations along with joint ventures and in time Draft King will be bigger and a major player with a much higher stock price then today. To get to that point DKNG will have to spend and so their earnings for the next few years will lack profit but have tremendous growth. So if you could wait a while, this may be life changing for some..."
Draftkings was at $60 then they announced the offer to buy - then the stock went down. We should be back at $60 then?
Goldman Sachs upgrade Dkng to 77$ Buy rating
this drop was self inflicted by the management
