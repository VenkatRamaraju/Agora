Amazing close !
Surprise NFT drops today - Simone Biles
NFL season hasn't even started yet. THIS IS EXCITING!
Just wow!! Lol
"Legend has it that if you look in the mirror and shout Draft Kings 3 times, your portfolio will magically 10x"
Again MMs and HFs want to keep it below 60
Up down up down… I mean this is positive that you can’t keep this stock down anymore
"So, we’re moving opposite of Apple, amazing every time I mention this I get thumbs down. I own both. Why I see the trend between the 2. Sector’s people"
"The bottom line here: over the past few quarters, the landscape for DraftKings has dramatically grown. We're still heavily banking on sports betting legalizations to help grow DraftKings' core business, but the story has become a much wider net than sports betting. Suddenly, casinos, restaurants, NFTs, and streaming are all (at least potentially) in the picture, signifying DraftKings' eventual shift into becoming a bona fide entertainment giant. On top of very strong numbers in Q2 and an exploding paid user base, I think there are plenty of reasons to continue staying long in DraftKings."
Fed schmed!!! They are not raising rates. The only thing that matters!!
I would not pay Mickey Mouse a park admission for any association. Mickey should pay DKNG. Growing already at a fabulous growth rate. Mickey can't help DKNG as much as DKNG can help Mickey
DKNG should be up 10% on this news. CEO speaks in 10 min.
DraftKings dominating the Pacquiao Fight night!!!
Connecticut all set in a few days!! They said September
I’ll take anything over 59 end of day. Great week!
Watching 55 EOD
I always enjoyed the 60’s growing up.
"if we see near double the volume of 15,000,000 shares. from yesterday. we will see a gap up of 3 to 5 million shares in early morning trading. DKNG will go up over 10 points plus And volume has been high and higher everyday for the last 2 trading session s. let see what happens in the early morning trading"
"I remember Microsoft stayed @ $25 for yrs, now over $300. Take the pain and hold, thats the way it's done."
We finishing above $60 ladies and gentlemen??
"When RECORD BETS are announced from NFL/college month 1, this #$%$ gonna rocket!!"
"PlayUSA estimates $20 billion in bets will be made for the upcoming football season, split as $12 billion for NFL games and $8 billion for college football games.The estimate would nearly triple the $7.5 billion bet on football during the 2020-2021 season. The raised estimate comes as more states have legalized sports betting and the season will be less disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic."
Monday 8/30 DKNG implied open $61.80
DraftKings is up 5.96% to 56.50
Run up to 70 soon come!
Connecticut all set for September 6thboth mobile betting and Igaming!!
"has anyone actually read the sports illustrative article. I just looked at cover, seems like a good thing just don't know what the article actually says.."
"Let's bring this above $60 sooner so not many lost $50,000. Let those criminal law firms waste their advertising money. Let's laugh to the banks."
Shouldn't DKNG be trading @ $75+ with all the stadiums opening up to max capacity with sports betting all time high?
DKNG commercials all over Arizona tv this weekend.. exciting
"They just signed a deal with ultimate league frisbee. Really doesn’t sound like a needle move or calm one way or the other. However that is such a niche sport that the possibility definitely exists that because of that they will get new, unique gamblers. I wouldn’t expect this move to do anything except keep them going in the right direction. I definitely like winning dollars but win enough pennies and it’s the same thing"
LOUISIANA pushing emergency measures to go LIVE for football season!! They all want it!!
Are the amateur quants of Yahoo Finance projecting another upward move today or nah?
My average for $DKNG is $47.90 I’m confident this will be $100+ EOY 2022 so much positive news and the new seasons starting soon! All hail the king
SQUUEZE those Shorts
NFL regular season coming up soon and NBA soon after that... matter of a couple months and this could push to new high.  if you agree
"When Cathie Wood buy, you BUY.She has been loading up big time on DKNG."
"I'm expecting that when the NFL starts playing within a month, DKNG will be trading in the high $50's or even possibly the low $60's. So just hold on."
I am reconfirming my $75 target with chances of raising to 89. Let's play.
"How many new ambulance chasers can Yahoo Finance advertise/post today? Should we ""unleash the Dogs"" on them? Please advise...."
DraftKings is the King!
Any of the amateur quants out there want to throw out some unrealistic predictions for tomorrow?
Upgrades today.
"Hello 56. It's been a while, we've missed you!"

Loop Capital has a $105 PT......Here we go Boys!!!
"Goldman analyst Stephen Grambling, ""We upgrade DKNG to Buy as we expect ongoing sales beats versus consensus driven by 1) sustained market leading position in new and existing markets, 2) ability to participate in the economics of single operator states, and 3) presence of national partnerships that should allow them to accelerate growth and achieve scale sooner than the broader peer group."""
NFL + NHL + NBA =

"Not a great day for our sector, but with the monster gains recently it’s understandable."
guess it's going to flat line algo trade the rest of the day!
"Who will win the race to bring online poker back to the US? Fanduel was acquired by flutter which also acquired pokerstars and full tilt. Draftkings is being tight lipped but you know this is the next battle for market share. Billions in revenue at stake. I'm guessing the US based DKNG will hit the ground first, with an assist from the justice department's long memory of pokerstars past sins."
"Placing the Rocket on the launch  pad. All systems a goUnder the agreement, DraftKings will be able to offer Simplebet’s micro-betting products for the NFL, MLB and NBA and a new suite of college football products, which are the first micro-betting products available for collegiate sports. With micro-betting, DraftKings customers will now be able to wager on even more individual moments over the course of a game through the DraftKings Sportsbook."
"they tried to scare you out of your shares when they dumped this to $41 from $76. look, I've been investing as a retailer for 30 years. almost ALWAYS I have made the most money by doing very little..just buy stock and let it ride for forever. if you constantly watch day to day you'll drive yourself mad. holding here since $12.11 from the days of DEAC. guess what? I'll hold for another 10 years as the gaming industry continues to evolve. the easiest way to make money is by doing very little and next to nothing."
You would think its Friday the way are wheels are stuck in the mud here @ 60
WHOA!!! BLEW THROUGH $56
Fantasy football will help bring this up. Looking to imitate a small position.
I wish I had more shares... this is an easy $70
Green by EOD

NFL will pump this stock to 100+
Cathie of Ark Invest got “Wood” for DraftKings
"cooking up some shorts, add some butter"
Cheers!! The Oregon Lottery Commission voted to switch its mobile betting operator from Scoreboard to DraftKings
Wow no end of day selling for DKNG on a Friday!!!! Get ready for big moves next week. All the profit takers have left and people with strong conviction remain. VERY EXCITING!

The DKNG Train has left the station!!
DJ they will today
NFT market is way bigger than people think....If they keep getting top athletes this is a potential game changer.
DK already has a relationship with ESPN. DIS is parent company of ESPN.

picked up another 480 shares this morning. im now sitting at 1325 shares. Looking forward to football season!
NEW YORK WAKE UP...CUOMO IS OUT...LEGALIZE!
"DKNG betting just 20x !!!!!We're excited to be working with Simplebet to change the in-game betting experience for our customers and, together, changing the way sports fans engage with their favorite sports,"" says DraftKings exec Paul Liberman"
Should I avg up even though I’m up almost 20% from my cost basis? Wasn’t done building out
Manny Pacquiao fight!
Buying opportunity before $250+
Cathy Woods has $1B of DKNG... she knows.

Havnt seen a day like this since last winter
UNLEASH THE HOUNDS!
"@Richard, if you're around, cheers to you! It's been a long summer!"
One week left until Connecticut all good.
just picked up 600 shares. Lets get back to $70
Every Green Day is a good day!! Hail to the longs! May the longs be with you!! Tomorrow I see some big uptick in price !!
A very healthy uptrend. Reaching RSI of 72 now. Still some room to 63-ish before we will see a RSI correction to 40 RSI and then up again
$FUBO can grab customers from $CMCSA Comcast subscribers and from sports bettors at DraftKings $DKNG and also from $ROKU who are looking for a fuller solution.
$60 next week with football around the corner!
final push of the day coming! lets close above 60!
Anyone else think this could rip this afternoon if the volume picks up?
Going live in Arizona this weekend! Letsss goooo!!
Let’s get green
"accumulation is very healthy right now, next leg up to 64 range coming by weeks end….plus one week closer to NFL season starting#DKNG#NOBRAINER"
"just remember when bears pointed to the financials of companies like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, and Tesla. where are they now? financial alone do not paint an accurate picture in a vacuum. financials can easily change if the company decides to pull back on spending for advertising. do not miss the forest for the trees focusing on financials only during a growth phase that's early in the company's lifecycle. if it is year 5 and still no profits, ok, but the stock is barely over a year old and there are still many battle ground states to win. the market for sports gambling, when you include illegal wagers, was once estimated to be worth $100B per year. it's massive."
I think tomorrow will see red because of how much and fast this stock has gone up! Long term this stock is killer though. May the longs be with you!!! Hoping for $75 by end of the year.
OH CANADA in three days
Opinions? What happened yesterday to bring it down? Why is it up today?
Do not bet on sports. Bet on this stock! Odds much greater
"Over 51K volume for 60 calls, just a guess but I think all the folks who sold 55s, bought the 60sbecause they are realistic about it not going back to 55."
this stock is controlled every week by options. every week
ARK increasing their position... NFL and College football seasons starting in the next couple weeks plus NBA and NHL starting in October...
not allowed to be green. classic
Online gaming conference today. Robins to speak at 10:30am. Always good for the shareholders to promote this great company. Hopefully some good news today as well.
60 is still an awesome entry point into a company where the SP will undoubtably one day reach 200 plus dollars a share! No brainer hereI believe we will eventually see a 300 to 400 dollar per share price if they execute properly. I am betting they do :)
Very very solid day!
Give us a little bump up to close the day out!
Better get covering shorts. This thing is MOONING soon!
"come on YAHOO FINANCE get these legal posts stopped already, enough is enough"
As said pushing to 60
I'm still here with my 5300 shares and loving it.
"I'm able to create DraftKings account as well as FanDuel in AZ i have to say im a stockholder in both but DraftKkings App just looks so much better, much more advanced.. I Love it!!!"
"College football will be our first big moment. Georgia vs Clemson, 2 top 5 teams playing on Saturday night is a big deal. Hopefully the market takes that into account"
It’s gonna take a huge amount of work to shake this thing back to 55 calls by Friday. I don’t see it happening. Up we go!
thank you for the dip today so I can buy more!!
"Legit BREAKOUT, BOYZZ!!"
Don’t we all feel sorry for the shorts and the attorneys advertising to join class action suits. NOT
You cant sell this. $60 is coming soon!
"look at the charts last year from late august to all of september, DKNG runs big from here to new high by the end of september,, 56, 62, 71, new high"
Stand back for Monday big open!
Like I've been saying for a year on here.... NOTHING STOPS THE GAMBLE!
Long live the King!
will meade is calling this 1
"normal for month end….tomorrow is September 1st, this will be the biggest month to date for DKNG"
100%…..end of september new high
Don't be shy... take a peek at $57
Today was turning point up.
I’m going to continue to add every week through the end of the year at least. Even with a market pullback. This is best in class. It’s going to be a monster some day.
Canada starts tomorrow. Do we expect any press on this?
CW did a lot of shopping at draftkings today. A lot of shopping!
"If 3 buys 1, WOW! BetMGM buying Flutter/FanDuel would shock me... and it wouldn't. Things we know: 1. Online gambling is EXPLODING faster than expected and it's going to be BIGGER 2. Consolidation is happening 3. DKNG is a BEAST in this industry. #1 or 2 depending in who you ask. DKNG is going to get/keep a big piece of the pie. HOLD ON BOYZ!!! It's a helluva ride."
"O my god, 56"
Just in POTUS places bet. won't last 4 years
60 is here
and that's how you end a day boys!

New customer count rising significantly and existing customer annual bet rising 20%plus. Margins going up and new NFT and advertising revenues will positively impact margins .Huge surprise might be small profit in Q2 2022.
All Gretzky NFTs sold out today just as fast as the Bradys did last week. Approximately $300k in initial sales plus a 5% fee going forward on secondary sales. Will add up fast!! Just wait until they drop Jordans!!
Not sure I fully understand the ESPN news. I hope Draft Kings doesnt agree to pay Disney for the use of the ESPN name. I think ESPN should be paying Draft Kings.
"MGM buying Flutter means MGM acquires pokerstars and full tilt. This is not good. Poker is coming, and a US company bringing back the two dominant names in online poker will be more easy to swallow than a foreign company reaping all that revenue. DKNG needs to ramp up its roll out of online poker in all the states where they have DFS. If we can hit the ground running before the merger, then all is well. Gl"
"LOL = Following the Hindenberg report, DKNG stated, “This report is written by someone who is short on DraftKings stock with an incentive to drive down the share price… Our business combination with SBTech was completed in 2020. We conducted a thorough review of their business practices and we were comfortable with the findings.”"
Push it!!! 
All time high comping soon

"Gambling shows no signs of slowing down. U.S. gambling revenue hit $13.6 billion in the second quarter, a new industry record, according to the American Gaming Association."
Canada going legal with single event sports gambling this week. At least 5 new states having gambling this year along with other states lining up to legalize to fill those budget holes. Just the sports gambling alone is going make DraftKings go up. Not to mention the new collectible revenue streams launching. Exciting times.
 BOOM ! GNOG which is in the process of being taken over by DKNG dropped this news Golden Nugget Online Gaming Awarded Arizona Tribal Events Wagering Operator LicenseDKNG is on a roll.

How much DKNG is ready to pay for acquiring GNOG ? It seems that more players are discovering GNOG and might be interested to also make an offer for GNOG ?
