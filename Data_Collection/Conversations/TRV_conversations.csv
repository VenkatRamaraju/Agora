The trade war got very real today. Devalued Chinese currency offsets tariffs and makes US products more expensive. China goes elsewhere to buy agricultural products. Trump fights this fight with no allies.

It has been a busy time as I have attended and donated to two worthwhile charity events: Paddle and Party for Pink as well as the Southampton Hospital Event. Even so I must admit to a bit of disappointment with my fellows citizens. My favorite charity (APDPP) Association for the Protection of Disabled Polo Ponies had an event and the donations were meager at best. Sadly this means that a number of noble steads will end up as dog food instead of living out their lives in the manner that they so richly deserve.

"I should also add I have been waiting for a pullback in insurance stocks to enter into a position, and Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have provided that opportunity. However, with my recent personal insurance coverage decisions, I have decided to invest in PGR instead of TRV. I feel Travelers is losing a lot of it's customers, like myself, becuase of their management's decision to raise rates unscrupulously on multi-policy holders with unblemished insurance records and height ratings. I feel it will be the downfall of Travelers in the competitive insurance industry. They already lost a long-term customer in me to Progressive (PGR) and I see no valid reason to expect this won't be growing trend."

Until TRV quantifies, too risky to buy TRV, even though it is now below my $120 buy target. Could this hurricane prove to be the worst storm related financial loss in the history of Travelers? Does anyone have a link to TRV reports that I've overlooked? TIA.Opinions appreciated."

"This is good voting info. and funny  too, While walking down the street a Senator was tragically hit by a car and died. His soul arrives in Heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.""Welcome to Heaven,"" says St. Peter. ""Before you settle in it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""""No problem just let me in,"" says the Senator.""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven.Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""""Really?, I've made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven,"" says the Senator.""I'm sorry, but we have our rules.""And with that St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell.The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends, Obama, Biden, Schumer, Maxine Waters and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. They played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.Also present is the devil who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.They are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go.Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him, ""Now it's time to visit Heaven.""So, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing.They have a good time and before he realizes it the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns. ""Well then you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity.""The Senator reflects for a minute before he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell.""So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell.Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.""I don't understand,"" stammers the Senator. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened? The devil smiles at him and says ""Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you voted."" VOTE WISELY NOVEMBER 2018!!"

"Forest Fires Raging In The WestI reported 6 weeks ago about this national problem. Not a single person was interested. You are now seeing smoke from these fires clear to New York, some places are reporting terrible air quality.

The amount of acres burned is reported to be larger than the total filed last year and season has just begun."
"AbortionsVice President Mike Pence told a crowd gathered Friday in Washington for the annual March for Life rally that ending taxpayer-funded abortion and choosing a Supreme Court justice who will uphold ""God-given"" liberties are among top priorities of the Trump administration.One of Trump's first official acts after taking office a week ago was to sign an executive order banning U.S. aid to foreign groups that provide abortions. Pence said more such action would continue.Trump will ""work with the Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health care services for women across America,"" said Pence to the crowd gathered near the Washington Monument.The vice president also accused the U.S. Supreme Court, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, of having ""turned away from these timeless ideals."""

"After 20+ years holding, I bailed at $151 today. I swore if I ever saw $150 again, I would be out. TRV was a solid investment for me through the years, including dividends. Best to all of you choosing to hold your shares. Thank you Travelers management, job well done!!"

Why did TRV miss earnings big time if no hurricanes have made landfall on U.S. soil this year?? What the heck is going on??
"I previously sold 1/3 at $130. Glad I chanced holding the remaining 2/3 into earnings, always risky with TRV 'buy rumor sell news' history. Anyone know the analysts updated target prices?"
The weakness here is an overreaction. Will be $150 in a year.
TRV reached a 52 Week low at 83.91
Shorted TRV at the open today. Two hurricanes is simply too much for Traveler's to overcome anytime soon.
"cheap, ok margin, low dividend considering their level of cash flow, yes I considered their capex as well hence their high depreciation and high cash level."
4/24/19RBC Set Price Target Travelers Companies (TRV) $145.00 Neutral
TRV ...$150.00 you can do it.
Travelers gets a great salute from me. During the recent PGA Golf Tournament Jim Furyk posted a record 58. He was awarded $59 Million for a charity. He donated the full amount to two charities. A class act by both parties. This now makes a total of $2.8 Million Travelers has donated to charities.
"TRV is holding its own in spite of claims being settled. They project a 0.12 earnings per share for next year. With all the fires, hurricanes, continuing floods with tons of debris, WM is making very good strides in clean up."
Obama lied to us about Obamacare
Stansberry Investments issued a BUY rating on TRV today.
"A current report on the Internet lists the 70 best companies to work for in New Jersey. The Travelers Companies are not on this list. They also list Newark, Trenton, and Camden as unsafe cities with very high crime rates. Unless TRV is doing extremely well in business, why are they still there in this environment? Posters from NJ, shed some light and rebuttal on this. I was told they pulled out of Detroit area..."
Non Reactions A WondermentNo response to hurricanes and forest fires that will cause insurance claims to be filed? Guess there is no interest or comments?
Did Mr. Buffet really sell TRV during last year's crash?
Read Raymond James article. Many companies continue to pay their people while at home and many are working from home. I see it as reduced exposure for workers while still collecting premium with some reduction but less claims. Thoughts?

Yes it's true Obama lied to everybody about Obamacare telling us it would cost less when in fact every year health care premium went up since Obamacare was passed and by the way you can keep your doctor and health insurance company was one big whopper lie Obama told all of us.

Maybe all the undocumented illegals streaming across our borders will have the answers!"

"Valuation is close to 50% higher than historically. In 2014, 2015, and 2016 the EPS was higher than today and the share price was between 80 and 120. Paying 150 plus for less earnings is foolish."
"The Sheep Shouldn't PanicThere will be a couple of more days of sell off, then TRV will stabilize again. It still remains a solid company. With this dip this will be an excellent time for prudent investors to add to their shares or come aboard for first time."

The cost for Hurricane will be too high to TRV and shares may go down in short term.
"It's almost as if people forgot about the Great Texas Freeze which is estimated to cost at least $18B, and all the claims that came with that. I'm not excited about Q1 results for any P&C insurance. They'll recover, but not a good time to make a move."

did travelers cut their dividend? or is my data wrong here
"OBAMACARE - IN JUST 4 SENTENCES A Great summary by a Notre Dame University engineer professor.Here are the 10,535 pages of Obama Care condensed to 4 simple sentences..As humorous as it sounds.....every last word is absolutely TRUE!1. In order to insure the uninsured, we first have to un-insure the insured. 2. Next, we require the newly un-insured to be re-insured. 3. To re-insure the newly un-insured, they are required to pay extra charges to be re-insured. 4. The extra charges are required so that the original insured, who became un-insured, and then became re-insured, can pay enough extra so that the original un-insured can be insured, so it will be 'free-of-charge' to them. This, ladies and gentlemen, is called ""redistribution of wealth"" or, by its more common name, ""SOCIALISM,"" or ""PROGRESSIVISM,"" the politically correct names for COMMUNISM! Does that cover it?"
TRV is up 4.94% to 125.73
Markets just don't read the books. Big hurricane in an area where TRV has a lot of insured. TRV goes up & HD goes down. How's a person supposed to make any money?
 Obama had worst GNP of any Modern day President under 2% all 8 years
"After being a Travelers multi-policy customer (Home, Auto & Umbrella) for most of this decade, I have tired of their unrelentless rate hikes on customers like myself who have an unblemished insurance record with high ratings. As of yesterday, I cancelled ALL of my Travelers policies and after an exhaustive comparison, I have selected Progressive insurance for all of my insurance needs that is saving me in the thousands of dollars every year..."
"My clone posted a message on this board that was very negative on Insurance, but that is not my sentiment. I own TRV for long term because it is winner and insurance should do well in a rising rate environment. I rarely buy a dividend payer to trade. I buy for the long term. Paying taxes is the last thing I want to do out of my brokerage account. I tend to invest like Buffett. I buy and hold usually for a lifetime and that way I control my taxes."
California wildfires will impact the insurers.
"Not into rapid moves, buying should be good deal"
Travelers Companies is up 8.78% to 138.15
Republicans will take the blame for any failure. They have control and all they can come up with so far is a plan that drops 24 million from insurance and cuts taxes for the wealthy.
Democrats and Republicans be happy today Obamacare is getting repealed and fixed. Your premiums won't be going up like mine did every freaking year and the deductibles should be coming down thanks to the GOP and Trump. Nancy Pelosi / Obama / Democrats sold us a pack of lies but now it is finally it's being fixed. Ask your senator to pass the bill too. It'll be a win-win for everyone in America .
So Travelers just implemented a plan to buy back over 12% of the company?(5 billion divided by a $40 billion market cap)

"Why TRV Earnings Will Continue to Decline: As a long-time employee with the claim organization, I’ve seen dramatic changes in the culture at TRV. With more focus spent catering to millennial’s, diversity workshops and meditation sessions, TRV has forgotten how to make money. Many long-time employee’s saw this coming and spoke up but were met with ire and attempts to discredit. The late Jay Fishman would have never let this happen. Employee’s over 50 with 20, 30 and 40 years of service are being fired (without cause) at alarming rates with TRV destroying lives of loyal personnel all to reduce expenses for the bottom line. TRV has become a company unwilling to utilize the knowledge and experience of dedicated employees that were trained by Jay Fishman on how to make money."
STRAIGHT up since XMAS bottom.....$150 all -time high....this is looking like a GREAT SHORT soon!!!!!!!!!
"Yes, I agree. Another dull and boring stock that pays a 2.25% dividend posed to see $200"
TRV does not pay #$%$' for divi although payout ratio is a 'low 27%'. Not worth the risk if they don't support share price with a decent dividend!
TRV is down 7.34% to 89.33
Several area's in the West are now having floods as a result of the forest fires. More needless damage and loss of assets.

Under reserved means they underpriced their business... except on asbestos which is a long term issue and is a legal issue and was an unknown at the time. The questions is whether or not they are still underpricing on current business.
