TRV is another $200 stock that I'm willing to collect the 2.38% dividend on while I'm waiting.
"TRV is another one of those long-term holds, collecting a 2.25% while waiting for it to reach $200. It sure beats the .2% return sitting in the money market account."

"The Travelers Cos. (TRV) reported third-quarter net income of $662 million.On a per-share basis, the company said it had profit of $2.62.

The average estimate of six analysts was for earnings of $2 per share.The insurer posted revenue of $8.81 billion in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $8.8 billion, which also topped Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed expected $8.52 billion."
"Yes, still a dull and boring stock that pays a 2.25% dividend posed to see $200Reply"
"Forest FiresThe annual budget for forest fires in California is $2.5 Billion. In 2021 this skyrocketed to $10 Billion which included actual fire fighting, according to Stanford Climate Policy Department. The fires in California burned over 2 Million acres. Many of the Insurance Companies deducted the price/value of the land before claims were paid. A law was recently passed they can no longer do this in California."
Will Travelers business interruption form kick in for civil order with government mandated closures due to the virus?
The sky is falling

"Extreme Heat In Western StatesWashington and Oregon report 230 deaths from heat which has been as high as 118 degrees. Vancouver has had 233 deaths from the heat. If any further forest fires break out from this condition and drought, this could become a disaster. Over use of power for A/C's could cause a power shortage adding to the problems. Think of the insurance claims that could be filed."

"qtrnomore, Thank YouFor casting your vote for Trump. You made an excellent choice with stock market up, economy strong, people going back to work, he has accomplished most of what he promised, etc.I'm off to Hawaii to bolster the economy further."
"Reserve requirements for Insurance Companies are determined by the State in which the Company is doing business. The purpose of the reserve requirement is to insure that if a catastrophic event were to happen, with a large percentage of policyholders affected, the Company would have enough money to meet the claims.The current statements about over $500 million loses on forest fires in California plus the three hurricane losses in the Gulf do not take into consideration of these funds that all insurance companies must provide.....Things are not nearly as bad as the media states. TRV is an excellent company and will to be one of the best insurers in spite of disasters from time to time. Have a little faith in this good company, don't panic, you could be the loser."
Target Price of $148. very attainable within the one year time frame.
Where Is Qtrnomorewe need him to pep this board up a little. Forest fires brought little response. Now we have a log jam of Container Ships off the West Coast that some have been waiting weeks to unload. The pollution they are causing is terrible. A lot of Christmas items won't make it to merchants shelves in December.
Closed the office at noon today so the employees could have a well deserved 4 plus days vacation. Have a nice Big Bird Day everyone.....

"I hope stock price of INSG does not slide back under $10. I’ll see next week if it goes back up to at least $11. Way to go back to $12.75 yet I’m holding on but patience sometime gets the better of it. Like my $TRV still down $39 per share at this price now of $114 bought last year with my 300 shares, again I’m holding on. It frustrates me a lot."
"Yes, I agree. Another dull and boring stock that pays a 2.25% dividend posed to see $200"
A 10 PE and 4.5 billion to go in stock buybacks. Sounds like good odds to me! $200 pt
"Picking up more shares here...selloff today is merely profit taking after a nice run up....15 p/e + a nice div, TRV will benefit from higher rates (TRV investments) and rotation into value. We're going higher."

"Insurance CostsReserve requirements for Insurance Companies are determined by the State in which the Company is doing business. The purpose of the reserve requirement is to insure that if a catastrophic event were to happen, with a large percentage of policyholders affected, the Company would have enough money to meet the claims."
"My thoughts on this are positive. TRV continues to collect insurance premiums and during this time of lock-down, their risks are minimized regardless if they are paying people to work form home. This stock is very cheap at this price and people who buy it won't regret it in 2-3 months."
