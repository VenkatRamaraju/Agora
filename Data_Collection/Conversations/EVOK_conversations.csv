Funny how the comment section of the first article on list about sales promotion on social media has been blocked after only 2 weeks on line. Guess its nots working all that well. Spend some money on commercial advertising like all the other drug companies you btholes. If you really want to get gimoti out there you have to get to the audience. You'd actually be surprised how 10's of millions of adults do not waste their lives on FCB etc.
"Healthcare practitioners view nasal route like IV.... Thanks for find that out. There were 100 of thousands of IV metoclopramide being used in hospitals every year and every single time they threw away the syringe. Now as I recall, your format bottle contains 112 sprays, are hospitals reuse your nasal spray times and again after inserting it up a patient nasal passage or are they supposed to throw it out after each patient?"
Pretty obvious what is right around the corner anyone can see the writing on the wall
"Well the latest article is quite long , but it says nothing."
"it's obvious what's happening bois, someone is picking up cheap shares at the end of the day. been like this for a while now."
Love to hear both sides with optimism and pessimism. For an FDA approved novel drug with a huge market base and current market capitalization of $40M is mind boggling. This should be trading higher and predict market cap will rise to $400M in due time.There is so much potential for this company and it’s flagship Gimoti that I believe will eventually gain its due respect.
"It's good to see that Evoke Pharma has plenty of liquidity on its balance sheet, suggesting conservative management of liabilities. Because it has plenty of assets, it is unlikely to have trouble with its lenders."
"The FDA'S foresight saves this co again. The FDA required that they make available smaller dose, 7.5mg, and apparently they have been working on it for quite sometimes. It would be great if it will come out at the same time as Merck's Covid pills approval... and hopefully in a smaller format."
What is happening to this company?
Who is the buyer? And what would be considered a good share price for the buyout?
"Gonyer, please sell this pile of chyt.Thank you"
they won a sales award eh. check linkedin
"“GIMOTI has made a huge difference in my patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Their nausea-vomiting is usually resolved pretty quickly, which is usually the most troubling and most damaging symptom in their lives. They're able to eat as the early-satiety goes down and it improves the bloating/abdominal pain, because it's working as a prokinetic, that also allows them to live a somewhat normal life,” stated Viplove Senadhi, MD, Greater Montgomery Patient Centered Gastroenterology and Hepatology, in Montgomery, AL. “For me, this is a paradigm shift for my patients in my practice, showing the quick efficacy, the lasting ability, and the ability to acutely affect patients with nausea-vomiting with a new modality to treat them. It's actually changed my standard of care.”"
"lol, there is no volume....."
Form 8-K was filed today. Buyout is coming!
Another retest at 1.35.Establishing a higher low.Might see some upward momentum into earnings. Glta
Who gives a hood for a buyout dog biscuit? Nobody. Investors are not dogs. Spray away sales aid was fortunate. Versa Zogenix. Unfortunately someone has died on their clinical trial even though it was thought not to be related to the trial itself. Incidental death from heart valves or lungs considering their drug history!!??? It spooks!
"Im in,,,,could very well be a rocket,,,revenue,,,patents and low shares outstanding,,,very rare to see 7 - 8 analyst having a strong buy rating on a small bio tech....."
Pitiful

"I gotta admit, I thought today would be a better day for EVOK"
200 MA 1.34
I have been involved in the market for almost 20 years and have NEVER see this type of price movement in a stock. Another position I hold is in second stage clinical trials and is DOWN to $2.68 in price while EVOK which has been approved is having trouble holding a dollar. I'm holding but have serious concern that something is VERY wrong here.
Merck's Monupiravir will be the first pill form therapy for people recently infected with coronavirus if approved. Those having erratic oral med absorption then would need a helping agent like nasal spray Gimoti. Good news.
Why did you suddenly go up after the market ended?
"Merck has asked for FDA approval for Molnupiravir emergency use authorization today. Move your rump, Gagner. 12 sprays format Gimoti now. Lots of money from it."
"New study:Key Findings:Continued increase in intent to prescribe GIMOTI: -- 92% of all respondents intend to prescribe GIMOTI in the future90% of targeted GEs; compared to 79% in previous study86% of non-targeted GEs; compared to 89% in previous study100% of PCPs; compared to 50% in previous study100% of NP/PAs; first time queried in this ATU studyTargeted GEs now report “Nasal” (45%) as the preferred route of medication administration for gastroparesis patients over “Oral” (26%).Targeted GEs report greater GIMOTI usage across first, second and third lines of treatment from the December 2020 study, with the similar use as a third-line treatment option at around 22%.Similar to the previous study, GEs indicated a moderate-to-high level of concern about a diabetic gastroparesis patient’s ability to absorb oral medications with more than half of respondents indicating that 21%-60% of their patients have trouble ingesting and/or digesting oral medications.The percentage of targeted GEs reporting high awareness of GIMOTI (scoring a 4 or 5 out of 5) has increased from 21% in December 2020 to 54% in September 2021."
"All week, this has been manipulated upwards with no volume to speak of.....I wonder if the Market Makers know something...If they do, why the extremely low volume, but up 20% since last thursday close?"
"It's already the last week of October, why is the share price is still so low?"
"Ocugen has a $2.5 Billion dollar market cap & produces 0 in sales. Investors all excited about WHO approvals when they actually need an fda approval for sales. Over at slow-poke evoke, fda approval received & it can't even match 5% of Ocugen's market cap."
"Did anyone else see this? Morgan Stanley Has $1.33 Million Stake in Evoke Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVOK)https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2021/09/10/morgan-stanley-has-1-33-million-stake-in-evoke-pharma-inc-nasdaqevok.html"
well that weak fake pump didn't work
There’s no appetite to sell at this point after one year + of FDA approval of Gimoti. The BEST is yet to come for Evoke.
"Remember a buy out would not just include the drug, the buyer also gets the patented delivery system (nasal spray) and that can and will be used in many other drugs in the near future. This stock is coming hard in the next few months and todays price will seem like it was free at todays price...^^^^^$10.00...$14.00"
Every cup needs a handle! 6 month chart
Yeah only know negatives about management so I think I’ll buy some puts here
"For the upcoming earnings call on Nov 8, 2021, there will LOADS of SURPRISES that will make lots of investors think differently about Evoke the company and it’s flagship novel drug GIMOTI…. Best is yet to come.Good luck to all!!!!"
Why did we go up at the end of last Friday? Any good news?
"The difference between Zogenix and Evoke is like night and day.Z is heavily bet on by hedge funds and E is like poor little stepsister Cinderella...Z drug was once a multiple billion dollars diet pill that the FDA has pulled and will never ever again be anything other than a drug for a rare disease, an orphan drug under any other designation. E drug was approved by the FDA after failing flat pivotal phase 3 at 5mg dose. The FDA approved a 15mg dose, 3 times the original dose seeking!Place your bet now hedge funds."
Market makers are manipulating once again…….
