Hold or buy
"Here's one more commercial payor to add to the long list of big, national insurers that have such major problems with gimoti they don.t cover it. It's noted Aetna does pay for oral liquid metoclopramide and of course the quick dispersible forms of metoclopramide. https://client.formularynavigator.com/Search.aspx?siteCode=1726717632&targetScreen=1&drugSearchText=gimoti"
"Well guys that was by far the most encouraging daily candle we have seen since the FDA news. I alluded to this last week and I've been wanting/waiting for this to happen and it happened today. If you use technical indicators on your charts, draw a horizontal resistance line at $3.74. Then draw a horizontal support line at $3.41. You will then clearly see that we've been trading in a channel since the FDA pop with that strong support at the $3.40 level. Then I want you to add the 10 and 20-day exponential moving averages to the chart. You will notice that the 10-day has finally caught up to price and has now entered the bottom of the channel. The market makers and institutions are so good and precise. They do this all day every day. Guess what they did? They went down first thing this morning and tagged the 10-day average to the penny, and we bounced off and headed higher the rest of the day like clockwork. That (hopefully) confirms that the market makers will use the averages as support while we move up and the uptrend is in tact, which should be for quite awhile. Like I said last week, once the averages catch up to price, that's an added layer of support. It looked like price wanted to test the bottom of the channel today, but now the 10-day stands in the way. Now this is the stock market, so anything is possible with news, but it should be incredibly hard to break through the averages and the bottom of the channel. The only road block other than the top of the channel is RSI is still close to 70. However, notice that we are at the same price and have a very similar daily candle to the day after the FDA news on 6/23. But on June 23rd, RSI was above 72, and here we are 2 weeks later at the same price (even a few pennies higher) with an RSI of only 66. That means price basically has gone nowhere in 2 weeks, but we are easing away from the ""overbought"" territory. The longer we stay here in this channel, the closer we get to being ready to bust out of the channel without price immediately being hammered back down from being overbought. Also, today's volume was a measly 456,000 shares about half of what's it's been the past week and shorts couldn't keep it down with the market selling off. Of course pharmaceutical companies typically don't follow market trends as they are more driven by news and results on drugs, etc. I'd like to see price hold strong for a bit longer and maybe allow RSI to slip into the low 60's or even high 50's and I think we'd be ready to breakout of the top of the channel. If we get a daily candle that closes in the $3.80's outside the channel while RSI is fairly low, it should be lights out for shorts at least for the next leg up. Good luck to all!"
"now$EVOK this here says it all. To address product quality/device quality issues cited in the CRL, the resubmission includes 3-month stability data from commercial scale registration batches that met all product specifications and support the proposed acceptance criteria for performance characteristics and device quality control. Additionally, as requested by FDA, the resubmission includes data from an analysis of pump performance characteristics for the product used in the comparative bioavailability study and the product from commercial scale registration batches. The results of this testing showed all products performed within specifications. The test done with nasal spray, that was not required met all the requirements for approval. This is 15 to 20 dollar stock upon approval. A must buy at this low share price. For all of those who challenged me on Evoke conducting a test with new nasal device here you go, met all requirements. The Drug will receive approval fast, remember already accepted for its safety and trails last submission. It now proved the nasal works with a test. This eliminated FDA requesting a test for nasal. They also had tons a test results and studies to support the comparative studies. This is a 3 to 4 billion company in first year of sales. They now have provided and proven everything for approval. Their will be a lot of sorry people that have held on to this investment for so long and got fished in and sold. 30 to 45 days tops for approval. It is way to easy with only 2 small supported parts for FDA to review. Remember record amount of approvals have been made this year in the shortest time."
Word on the street is EVOK has been sold. They are ofcourse just haggling on the price!!!
"All-Below is my original post 3 days ago and reposted by @Fred.EXCELLENT START TO APPROVAL!!!@Evok- BLOCKBUSTER upon approval!!!!!. Definitely a Buyout @$40 -$501. Current Market cap $55M2. No Debt (as known)3. Market opportunity for GIMOTI when approved next week will be $2B - $4B4. Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Production already contracted with Eversana (I believe will receive 20% of Revenue and Evok 80%)5.Gimoti Nasal Spray will be first of its kind treating Gastroparesis typically affecting women with diabetes.6. Only 5 EmployeesGOOD LUCK TO ALL!!!"
Be advised the HMO giant WellCare doesn't cover the EVOK generic nasal spray aka Gimoti.https://fm.formularynavigator.com/FBO/67/08_GS_Core_MAPD_CompForm_21392.pdf
"Gastroparesis is listed as a RARE Disease by NORD ( National Organization of Rare Disorders ). It has multiple divisions only ONE of which is diabetic gastroparesis. The FDA did NOT approve Gimoti for all forms of the rare disorder. GIMOTI is a dopamine-2 (D2) antagonist indicated for the relief of symptoms inadults with acute and recurrent Diabetic Gastroparesis. No other disorder, diseases or symptoms. Protocols to begin testing for a 7.5 mg dose have yet to be submitted to or approved by FDA. Furthermore, FDA plans post approval evaluation of Gimoti (metoclopramide) nasal spray risks and safety in the Sentinel System.Because Gimoti will be infrequently prescribed since it's indicated only for a scare patient sub-population of a multi- division rare disease its commercial success is highly unlikely"
"$EVOK I have a feeling Evoke had their meeting on Friday, we may see a premarket press release. The only reason I have been stating they would submitting last week was, we are getting close to holiday break. Definitely we will see a announcement this quarter, it should be this week. When I contacted management a couple weeks ago, they told me they were still on track to submit this quarter. I did some calling around to the FDA, Evoke can receive a automatic 2B I believe was the term she used, a approval during the live meeting, which is a temporary passing. This allows Evoke to manufacture/sell right away, then FDA will review the final Sub., come back in 30 days or less with a full approval. Remember FDA recently gave management permission to manufacture the drug, use the drug with the spray device to conduct their own test. This was Evoke Management’s decision not requested by FDA. This was a very positive step towards approval. The test conducted by Evoke had great results, which should easily earn them their final approval. FDA has already approved the PK trials/saftey of the drug. Now Evoke has proven tests with great results. The rest of the info requested by FDA, was information management had from their years of research/trials. If we get a press release of Sub., we will exceed 5 dollars within a week, if we receive a 2B, stock will go over $10.00 within a week. Recent resubmission in the last year saw passing as fast as the first week, the average was 30 to 45 days. I am a large holder of shares for 5 long years with a lot of money at risk. I have been constantly been in touch with management, along with offering a money raise a couple years ago, from a private fund client of mine. This was not required, as management told me, they had many funds offer them funding. I am a true believer this drug will be a game changer. If you look at Gonyer’s past, he usually sells the drug upon approval. With Evoke having limited shares, under 40 million in total, this should easily sell for 15 to 20 dollars a share. Leading up to final approval announcement we should see a 10 dollar mark. Remember before we received the 3 rd trial announcement we had reached 12.60 3 long years ago. Black Monday came July 17th and we went down to under 3 dollars that day. Let’s all hope this long wait is finally over and we can enjoy a great holiday season with bit of profit. Tip of the day will have another huge day was a stock I had mention 2 weeks ago MMV.CA or MNLF.US. Mineral Mountain Mines. It was 16 cent Canadian when I had mention this stock now 39:cents in 2 weeks. They had unreal first results and should be release further results this week. They are drilling right beside Homestake mine in South Dakota. It was the largest ever find of gold of its kind in 1850’s lasted till early 2,000’s pulling off 60 million ounces of gold. https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MMV.VN/opinion. I also had mention BTU 2 weeks ago and it went up 500 percent 7 cents to 35 cents in 2 weeks."
We will see a positive report as sales continue to grow daily. The sales and marketing staff are really starting to gain successful results. It takes time to reach out to so many doctors through out the USA. It also takes time to educate the suffering public. We may see a buyout tomorrow heading into the weekend.
Where we goin today??
"@as ho Stevie boy, I get these companies spam on to my email every day mostly in after hours and ore market then I do a little research on them and watch what happen. When ""BNTC"" after yesterday it were under $4, I bought it at 5 today during earlier market. Traded it 3 x during pre market and waited for open bell, then left it alone. I only share with this board if I think the stock is worldly to be shared. I am not an as ho to just throw shi out there. Like I said these stocks are soon on my email daily sometimes I share and Many times I don't. I don't want to share holders get burned. Speaking of burned as I had mentioned earlier I believe Gimoti nasal spray sales price might be a bit too high for the average consumer whom suffer from diabetic Gastroparesis, but that is my opinion. I checked out the price of Raglan pill form of metoclopramide it is selling around $15, I don't know how many pills per prescription, but that is a hell of a lo less expensive than Gimoti Nasal Spray form of metoclopramide. Although Gimoti Nasal Spray works much faster than Raglan pills to treat diabetic Gastroparesis suffers, but still the drug main ingredient is metoclopramide. I believe once the company set the right price for Gimoti Nasal Spray it will fry from behind the pharmacy counters like hot cakes. All still in my opinion."
"Diabetic gastroparesis is a small niche market at best. There's already OTC and generic drugs that are more efficient and less expensive as well as brand name drugs available. Difficult to see any insurance coverage without giant copays, pa's, deductables for their product that's destined to be a pharmaceutical flop."
New 52 week low coming.
SHARES are very very scarce and the amount of Shares needed to cover is very huge.Spike should be on the way from here on as I stated in my Monday post!!!!
200 MA 1.34
im pretty sure this thing is bought out. 18 million volume? all you soft hands that pulled out gonna regret. cheers to diamond hands
"bedtime reading ....https://media2.mofo.com/documents/faqshelfofferings.pdf There are further games Gonyer and his associates can play to further scare longs into selling EVOK.... but given I believe sales are really good and the ER reporting date is coming up real fast, I think there will be a buy out soon, this month. Equally, I have been trying to find out if there is a minimum period by which an officer of the company has to sell their warrants before a buy out occurs... that seems to be 20 working days.... and Gonyer filed on Dec 9th from memory.... that's precisely why I think next week is the big week.... all ducks in a row now..... although they could play further games with the SEC filings and delay things further, I don't believe its in their interests at all to delay this further. For instance, they will have applied for international use of Gimoti and once they hear back form the countries in question, they have limited time to disclose to the market... all factors I have seen (too many to list here) would strongly suggest an announcement causing a major shift in share price will occur this month, quite probably next week from Jan 11th. That's all for now."
Here are some thoughts to consider:- Potential peak sales of $300 million+- Small cap company with an FDA approved product - Metoclopramide is an already approved product on the market- 200 million+ oral solid and liquid dosage units dispensed annually. It won't be as challenging for market penetration since it already exists. - Improved bio-availability and less side effects than the oral formulations will have greater patient acceptability- Patent protection until 2030- They don't have the added overhead of sales and marketing. A strong commercial partnership with Eversana at the cost of giving up 20% profit is a win win situation considering it will allow them to turn profitable quickly- Their burn rate is less than $2 million/quarter. Their current cash position and line of credit will fund them until long after the product is launched and therefore they probably won't have the need for a dilutive offering. - ZERO Long term Debt!
Bagholders in panic mode. Poor launch of this most expensive version of a generic targeted to a meager patient market. Delay in third quarter report release. Any coupons used will only cause further loss.
This is the first time in my life I see a biotech company so close to the finishline with a marketcap of 43 mill usd and potential peak sales of more than 200mill usd. I think I will never will see a bargain like this. imo
Lots of action happening....somewhere else....anywhere else.....
Is buyout Friday still a thing? Where did all the canadians go?
"Shareholders like myself who grab those 1.07 on Monday and yesterday are smiling all the way to the bank. Thanks Short fries for covering, you push the share price up to 1.58 today. Lets do it again shorty."
Thoughts on price if/when approved?
I will sell at 10 bucks
Creeping slowly….. we will get there one day!!

"The prediction will be that between January 1st 2021 through March 31st 2021, 1,000+ units/doses will have been sold. With a unit cost @$1750, the expectations are that @Evoke will have revenues of at least $1.75M for QTR1 2021. From the above, this will blow away expectations and consensus. From what we heard in last weeks call, sales are ramping up and better than expected.The current stock price does not reflect the future potential of GIMOTI and its forward trajectory. This is a gem and will be reflected more so after QTR1 2021. Long term investors will be GREATLY REWARDED in the very near future.Good luck to all!!!!"

Evoke has debt but no earnings. Should you worry? Huh
"What they reported to the SEC August 6,2020 on page 5. Horrid!Evoke Pharma, Inc. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements1. Organization and Basis of PresentationGoing ConcernThe determination as to whether the Company can continue as a going concern contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As a result, the Company believes that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date these financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty."
"Unlike some here that “know” all, I’ll present an opinion. Todays price action looks like short covering? When have we seen 170k shares move the stock 15%? I’m thinking they don’t want to be in for ER. With a modest consensus, a beat may push this higher. Anyone know the Wainwright estimate for q1? I believe Laidlaw is 260k."
The shorts are starting to leave
"What happens now, the shorts need to find money somewhere before this goes up to $20. They better hope a BO isn’t in position on Monday or Tuesday. Then it goes to $40 a share."
Fresh faces from last weeks daytrading rush beginning to see the light. They got hosed!
"Yes, I'm a bag holder. 3260 shares at $3.90/share. I'm not proud of it, but I tend to accept reality. The reality I'm seeing now is a clear path to being delisted, guaranteed dilution, and a potential reverse split. And the only reason I say that is because despite the continuous bludgeoning from shorts, Goyner has failed his fiduciary duties to stock holders. The failure is in marketing, sales, and roll out! Covid slowed things down, but Goyner dropped the ball! I usually don't pick on the CEO, check my posts, but in my opinion, Goyner has failed us all! I will continue to hold, because at this point there is no sense in taking a 70% loss to scrape back 4 grand. Good luck to all longs, and I actually hope that I am wrong. If so, we all win!"
"i did similar comparison to Capr when it anounced that their cap-1002 cured 4-5/6 severely ill covid19 patients. however, Capr is not fda approved, only compassionate use. capr went to around 11$ from near 3$ share price. my calculation based on float and share price, indicates evok could be 8-9$"

"Dr. robin from the hood is a doctor of UFO who has frequently been targeted by the FDA (False Data Announcement) for promoting false, misleading and even dangerous medical advice. His site promotes products and his blog includes false and/or misleading information about medical topics. he is known as Sam zenith or williamson or mandingo1 they try to pump out your wallet. their latest claim is the day after tomorrow, you will see a buyout. the problem is that the month, week or year is unknown. beware!"
Current management for diabetic gastroparesis focuses on dietary and lifestyle changes as well as improved glycemic control. Limited options for medical therapies are available that include prokinetic and antiemetic medications that are available over the counter. About 40% of people with diabetic gastroparesis will improve with Erythromycin. Extended treatment with 35 yr old metoclopramide presents challenges such as decreased efficacy over time and increased risks for adverse events. Prescriptions for metoclopramide have decreased yearly since FDA ordered black box warning in 2009.
"""Drinking the Kool-Aid"" is an expression used to refer to a person who believes in a possibly doomed or dangerous idea because of perceived potential high rewards."
Call in the PR. Urge Gagner to lower the price. Zogenix sells its for $950. Diabetics have 2.3 comorbidities on top of paying $250 a veal of insulin. How can people pay $1750?
"I have been accumulating since it was $5, waiting patiently as I still have a lot of trust in the drug which is why I bought. Those who did their due diligence and know investing isn’t and overnight thing are holding patiently are the ones who will make money. This is going to be huge once pandemic is settled. I’m averaging down and holding , not selling a single share as I said many time before."
"Mr. Goyner should lease his technology to a Covid19 vaccine company. A Nasal spray vaccine is the only hope to end the Global Pandemic, because only a “Nasally Administered Vaccines”can keep vaccinated subjects from getting infected with a respiratory infectious decease . (Please research it and you’ll see I’m correct.) As long as there is infected people either vaccinated or unvaccinated, the virus will keep on mutating in them and creating new Variants."
"AllNow that it’s been APPROVED!, here are a few stats for your knowing and more to come20% of LEAST Market opportunity of $2B is $400M. 80% for@Evoke ($320M) & 20% for Eversana. Current Market cap is about $59M.Outstanding shares $24M.Based on the above facts, potential stock price should rise substantially!!!! After hours and especially next week. Looking at $8 - $12 next week.CONGRATULATION to all investors!!!!!!Enjoy this fabulous FATHERS DAY weekend!"
"Friends yesterday wasn't good in anyway. PPS down bigly at same time volume was up bigly. To top it off the short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker EVOK is 48% on Oct 28, 2020."
"If approved, this could be the next Covid-19 stock. The government is pivoting to end lockdowns that means they will have to gear up to protect the most vulnerables: The elderlies and diabetics. This nasal spray can be self administered helping keep diabetics at home, and out of doctor offices and hospitals. With nearly 2 millions confirmed cases, the diabetics will have to remain lock downed at home for sometimes."
"Don't forget their target of acute diabtetic gastroparesis is a scarcity within a rare disease class. Remember, a huge majority of diabetics take pills and those who only inject insulin would have issues with a super expensive version of a 40 year old generic drug and easily deal with cheap injectable generic. metoclopramide"
"This is a fantastic investment, really safe. You can go on a long vacation, take a sabbatical, get divorced, fly to Europe, marry a same sex partner, adopt some children from another continent, kill your spouse and children, go to jail for an indeterminate time, plead guilty, go to prison for a short stint, be realeased, get married and come home to your office and nothing will have changed."
"This is not even the start of the rise: if FDA approved Gimoti could generate $2-4b/year. With a P/E of 4 (that is too conservative I know) that would mean, if not already being bought out, a market share of $150-300/share."
What's puzzling to me Uncle is why would management buy out there warrants so early in the game if there wasnt a buyout ?But then why would they sign up for an investment conference after that?Anyone ?
"On 07-13 EVOK shorted 392,024 shares which is 52 %. Total shares traded 753,900. Crazy..."

"I muted samia as well. Too much. I only want to hear professional posts from people who know what they're doing and talking about. I was hoping we'd see $4, and we still might of course, but looks we'll have to wait for that.

"It was difficult getting gimoti FDA approved. They rejected it just a year ago. It's going to face a difficult uphill battle against less pricey alternatives. Let's see what they said to SEC on March 12 of this year : ""We are developing Gimoti, an investigational metoclopramide nasal spray for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in women."" That certainly cuts into how many of the already few patients will be able to get gimoti. They also told SEC in the March document: ""Phase 2B study Although an overall improvement in symptoms was observed in Gimoti-treated subjects with diabetic gastroparesis compared to placebo, the difference was not statistically significant...Phase 3 Clinical Trial Study. The primary endpoint for the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population was not statistically significant (p=0.881) """

wonder what the odds are of an approval based on a NDA resubmission are? i'm assuming they have corrected all the issues for the FDA or they wouldn't have resubmitted. if this is the case what are your thoughts on how high this stock with go based on an approval?

"There actually may be truth to the rumour they sold. Everyone was waiting for insurance companies to start covering their clients. Now they have 90 percent coverage by insurance companies. Big Pharma buys this and takes it world wide, watch out."
Funny how the comment section of the first article on list about sales promotion on social media has been blocked after only 2 weeks on line. Guess its nots working all that well. Spend some money on commercial advertising like all the other drug companies you btholes. If you really want to get gimoti out there you have to get to the audience. You'd actually be surprised how 10's of millions of adults do not waste their lives on FCB etc.
Market makers are just shaking the weak hands……buyout is almost here!

"It's good to see that Evoke Pharma has plenty of liquidity on its balance sheet, suggesting conservative management of liabilities. Because it has plenty of assets, it is unlikely to have trouble with its lenders."
"I own 9,050 shares, and I will not sell one share for less than $2."
Who will the buyer be??
Close above 2 $ today
This could return to its all time low of 50 cents if this keeps up.
"Evoke management will announce the final submission to the FDA. This was publicly stated 3 weeks ago, which also was one of the agreed condition NASDAQ granted Evoke management a 6 month extension, to bring the price of Evok listing above a dollar or higher for 10 days straight. This was achieved and approved today by press release. Evoke has succoured a date with a live meeting with FDA over 60 days ago. It takes 60 to 90 days to receive a appointment date with the FDA. This is why they publicly announced this to Nasdaq officials along to the public, this should take place any time this week. Evoke management has always kept their promises when announcing dates of submitting or receiving approvals, for the last 5 years that I have been invested. Once again this is a steal of a price to get in. 37 million shares, 60 own by insiders and corporate funds. Last year the same drug in pill and needle form did sales of 3 to 4 billion only in the USA. The pill and needle form was approved in 1989. These 2 forms have long delays of 2 to 3 hours before they stat working. They also have so many side effects many people suffering patients can not use pill or needles. There are thousands that can use Gimoti along with all those people using the pill/needle form. Gimoti has been approved publicly 3 months ago, a press release by the FDA for all PK trials/studies, along with the saftey of the drug was approved/announced. In the trials the drug Gimoti started working in 10 to 15 minutes not hours like pills/needles do. It also showed very little percentage on side effects for a small amount of patients. In the USA alone with thousands of more suffering patients being able to use Gimoti, we will see over 4 billion sales instantly innUSA alone. Evoke management has already applied and the Drug approved in many other countries to sell. This company will be sold for billions by a big boy which was always the plan. This could easily be a 20 to 30:dollars stock sell with only 37 million shares. This is once in a life time chance to make minimum 10 times your money."
"Hi there I'm new here. Is evok annualized return on invested capital (ROIC %) of -2,783.22% for last quarter a positive thing?"
10 cents
"Yes, I am woman enough to admit I was going for the big pay day with EVOK, believe David Gonyer was going to bring it home for us share holders big time, because I have been here for a couple of years. That $6.04 last year on June 19th in after hours approval made a believer out of me that David Gonyer and Evoke Pharma Inc was going to win it for us all, the company and share holders. Like so many here I blown away with the 14 sales of Gimoti. I loss a boat load of money from that news. I felt so sure Evoke Pharma Inc and the CEO was going to deliver. But I am still here. The share price has recovered a little, and I still believe Evoke Pharma Inc has something here with Gimoti Nasal Spray. I should have added when the share price tanked to 2.08. I have a 60 day sell, but will change it when I see much better sales and increase in share. Plus Evoke Pharma Inc become more transparent on the company progress reach month."
Buyout around the corner.
"What a fantastic finish, closing at the high of the day guys. Great week as well, other than the sluggish day on Monday. It's getting interesting. Notice that that 10-day moving average has now caught up to price and is currently sitting at that all important $3.40 level (although the 20-day is lagging a decent bit at $3.07). I'm liking two things....First, we have relatively medium to small up day candles since Monday. Ironically, I would prefer price not to spike up really hard with a huge green candle. RSI is at 69 still close to 70, and we see what happens when it gets way up over 70. Price snaps back down hard like a rubber band similar to what happened when it ran up to $4 last week. I actually would prefer a slow grind up. Shorts love to pile on when price spikes up to overbought territories while others are quickly taking profit. I know because I do that all the time, especially when price races up to historical resistance areas when buyers are irrationally greedy. But if we slowly move up walking along with the moving averages as they are catching up, shorts will not be near as interested. To me, that's more powerful than quick spikes. It's like a train that can't be stopped and shorts will not want to stand in front. We do have some historical resistance with a double top at the $4 level back in 2017 (and yes support/resistance levels from previous years can still matter). That could be another reason price rejected so hard off $4 last week, but when we punch through that, we are in clear blue skies until price gets above $7. Secondly, this is all happening on relatively low volume. The volume for this week has been 803k, 873k, 841k, and 877k shares traded today compared to 39 million, and 6 million the day and day after the FDA news. That means the shorts and day traders (like me) are losing interest and moving on to other plays. It also means that shorts are losing the battle and losing control. Shorts and market makers are notorious for keeping price down on low volume when buyers aren't really interested, but they haven't been able to do that this week. Hopefully they've wised up and have seen all this technical support along with the fundamentals and direction of the company to make them want to cover. The percentage of shares short on EVOK day the day before the FDA news was only 7.5%, but day of and after the approval it's been close to 30%. The shares are hard to borrow, which means if/when the big volume finally does comes in, it should squeeze a bit. Now, barring news which trumps everything of course, it's quite possible that price is still not ready yet to make the next leg up and me might be range bound and in a channel for another week or two while the technicals settle down, but I'm getting optimistic about the real likelihood of never seeing the $3.30's again.Heck, maybe everything I'm saying is moot if a buyout offer comes (which I will gladly welcome at a reasonable price) but until then, let's hope we keep rolling. Have a good holiday break guys!"
"Well at least my Tesla stock is thorough roof. I've been holding this stock since $48 alone with several other stocks which has went thorough the roof over the years, and Evoke Pharma stock will do the same some day once it hit the prescription market. it may not soar to over $1,600 like Tesla, but maybe over $100 per share when it start relieving patients from symptoms of nausea, vomiting, pain and bloating caused by Diabetic Gastroparesis disease. Right now $EVOK need to soar pass these $3+ plus share price for a drug which just received a FDA approval last month. Gastroparesis disease up to a $4 billion dollar annual commercial prescription maeket to treat the acute and chronic symptoms caused by Gastroparesis disease."
everyone knows that Evoke is on the verge of being bought. The leading Pharma company to purchase them is Bausch who has bought the last 2 companies from Gonyer the Founder of Gimoti. Bausch recently sold their eye drug lines and announced they are concentrating on Diabetic and Gastro drug lines. With only 48 million shares look for a 35 to 45 dollar buyout. Shorts are in trouble right now and look for the stock to get over the 5.00 mark today or tomorrow
"Well, well, well. Here we are...a day away from 'earnings' call. I figured cos this board has been bored for weeks, I would write a little ditty, to celebrate the now disinterested former fight club that was Evok chatroom. Here goes nuttin: ""Evoke is a joke"", and Rambo had spokenBut not even the Dude now can be awoken""A crushed-up pill is all you need"" Said Uncle, the cool-cat smoking his weedCanadian-bashing from Elvis the TerdIs not even fun, from him we've not heardAnd me with my endless wishful thinkingCannot help me think my investment is stinkingBut help might yet be on its wayWith a Buy-out tomorrow, no, it must be FridayGonyer's sold all his cars to MarkWhile all but facebook groups are in the darkSo here's to tomorrow, and what it may holdWhich might be a nightmare, i'd wish I had soldGood Night Dear Boys and Girls. I'm hoping the 1000 shares sold tonight for a $1 was a miserly stop-loss raid from insiders who know we're gonna fly tomorrow...if anyone cares..."
Pitiful but fully expected. Was surprise yesterday broke even. Had the false premonition that might be a good resistance point. So much for that. #$%$
"March 12 2020 SEC filing: ""Phase 2B study Although an overall improvement in symptoms was observed in Gimoti: treated subjects with diabetic gastroparesis compared to placebo, the difference was not statistically significant...Phase 3 Clinical Trial Study. The primary endpoint for the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population was not statistically significant (p=0.881)"
"They shutdown Disneyland, Sea World, University Studio, the ball parks, malls, restaurants, bars, museums, doctors had you to wait in your car, before the nurse came out and took ones temperature before letting these The doctor at the office or hospital during the height of the pandemic, and many or still doing these precautions. What makes people think the would just make appointments for Eversana sales person to come in and explain a new treatment for Gastroparesis disease. Most doctors office stopped answering phones. They didn't have much time for Medical sales teams and that included Evoke Pharma Inc and Eversana sales personnel team. The economy was hard on Many businesses last year. Like Evoke Pharma said in the conference call They will be reaching out directly to Gastroparesis suffers thorough different media. I will wait and hold on to my shares. Don't let the bashers and shorties get you down. This quarter and next quarter will be much better for Gimoti. The pandemic will be behind us soon May 1st every adult will be eligible for the coronavirus vaccine. Then we are closer to getting our economy open back up."
132 prescriptions!
There’s no appetite to sell at this point after one year + of FDA approval of Gimoti. The BEST is yet to come for Evoke.
"This is a very dirty move, like always Gonyer style. He should be investigated as this was pure manipulation. Do not sell shares as there is a company buying them, that will eventually purchase Evoke. The management and ownership still own million of shares, have not sold any, other then those few option. Look for more big news coming out and stock will rise again. They are mounting sales and awareness."
Melvin this will be near $10 by EOY. Dont worry there is much more pain to come to shorts like you and Mark
"here is my take after analyzing not just the company but also the sales team based on LinkedIn. most of the sales team are new, but there are a few very strong sales people that leads the pack. knowing sales, it takes a while to ramp up. the first wave of sales people were hired about 11 months ago. they would have started to prospect. the result of their hard work from months ago would show by now. it takes a few months between prospect and sale. I truly believe Q2 will be a very good quarter, it would be a better estimate of the sales trajectory"
Critical Alert : evok gives cautions about their statements regarding the timing of the commercial launch in forth quarter. Eversana contract allows up to 9 months for any launch. With covid impact its more likely launch will be delayed until next year.
"I don't they put it this clearly in their presentation material before. Sign of things to come.""Evoke retains ability to exit partnership under change of control event"""
"My 2 cents on the earnings report and sales.1. Weak sales due to COVID and more so due to ineffective sales team. This is attractive to the buyers with competent sales team in place already. They may be able negotiate a better price for the drug/patents. Goyner has lost the leverage and I don't think he able to improve on sales numbers on his own.2. Stock price will stay around $2.50( last offering) and potential buyer might accumulate shares. They are paying themselves if they choose to buyout.3. With no other catalysts in pipeline, Goyner may be motivated to sell and not bother with the idea of building sales on his own. So, he can get to his next drug, sooner than later.4. Buyout is imminent since there is no other drug this in the market, at this time. Not sure if they will get $20/share, More likely in the range of $10-12. That is still good for the people who are getting in at around $2.50 It is likely that the buyout will occur this year since vaccination plan is to be completed by mid/late summer.Any thoughts?"

"Approximately 162% growth in product sales, 152% growth in prescriptions and 57% increase in new prescribers for Gimoti Extends cash runway into third quarter of 2022"
Something may be happening here.Alot more inflow then outflow today. Ten times the outflow. Yet we had a dramatic drop.Buyout on the horizon?
Something will happen here in the next few days. The product is really good. This told to me by pharma insiders!
Top shareholders should get on a conference call with management and demand status. I’ve done this before and have rattled information out if management.!GL
Sorry fellas. Gonna have to wait til next quarter for another bump.
"The FDA approval of GIMOTI allows Evoke to access its existing $5 million line of credit from EVERSANA to support manufacturing and other aspects of GIMOTI’s commercialization. As of May 31, 2020, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.7 million. Evoke believes, based on its current operating plan, that its cash and cash equivalents, together with the EVERSANA line of credit, will support the company’s operations into 2021, without consideration of potential GIMOTI revenue"
"Have you read the FDA approval letter? The approval is for adults and at 15 mg dose. Evoke conducted trials up to 14 mg, resulting in 3 cases believed to be males having slightly lower cmax. The FDA wants this drug when used in conjunction with nsaids pain medication is effective alternative to addictive opioids."
"Black box warning, strictly forbidden by the FDA to discuss or promote the drug in any other use except for what it's indicated for- the Not too common DGp, no significant difference in the reduction in symptom scores between the spray and placebo groups, more costly than other drugs, doesn't work for men, extreme risk if used concomitantly with other commonly prescribed drugs. There's going to be weeping and gnashing of teeth when reality of sales and revenues dash hopes and expectations of dreamer longs."
It looks like the next chapter in Evoke’s story is chapter 11.
Another contributing factor to the already numerous causes of poor sales is that black box label and FDA restrictions on length of use will greatly reduce or make for non-existent refills of this old drug. Pharma pros know refills are vital.
Why did you suddenly go up after the market ended?
is there a link for the earning call anyone???

They are building up a big holding for the buyout. 400k or 1 million dollars in shares will be worth 4milllion. . Shorts better have my money! That’s all I am saying!
"$237,000 in sales. Good. q3&4 will be excellent."
who was saying 10$ lol
"Lots of good stuff to follow. Institutional investors buying, a buyout announcement. As mentioned before, since the day of approval they are forgoing millions each day having the patent rights. Millions. An announcement will come very soon."
"let me day dream a bit: Q2 revenue is at 2 million, shorts all got burned and company partnered with a giant to take this international"
Those social engagement metrics are good

Management does not want to run this company. And it shows. Will take years. Soooo much missed opportunity.
"why is it so quiet today? read the q2 again, believe we will go up, so loaded some more."
BDO LLP EVOKS Auditors since 2014 said this in 2020 :the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has not generated revenues or positive cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

"Evoke Pharma id currently in discussion with multiple Big Pharma. The company the partnered with to manufacturer and sell product have adds for 35 Rep across the nation. When calling if they have filled any jobs which thousands are looking for work they have not. Evoke is supposed to start selling Sept 1 Gimoti which has millions of suffering patients that will immediately purchase Gimoti. Evoke has a clause of breaking contract at anytime. It is clear as day company leaders by Gonyer is selling the company to highest Big Pharma bidder. That is why no one has been hired. Look for a Buy out of 25 to 35 dollars at anytime. There a total of 48 million shares. It has a world wide potential of 9 billion plus in sales, growing everyday as thousands of people a week are being diagnosed with diabetes. This is a steal at this price to purchase. Problem is no one is selling any large amounts of shares."
"Please Lord, let news be amazing this quarter for Gimoti Nasal Spray . Amen."
$3.00 a share buyout would be a fair deal
Here we go again
"Need to be ready for the announcement of a possible buy out from tomorrow to the 10th March..... I believe they are waiting for the sales data for February before they confirm the price......given they know these figures hourly if not daily, don't be too surprised if there is something in the press and SEC tonight/tomorrow onwards. There won't be an ER in my view, it will be negated by Bausch or Eversana themselves buying EVOK."

"Love this board. It's like a dysfunctional family, the pumpers on one side and the shorts on the other. Are there any normal investors on here? I wish this had some of the more premium pumpers, saying there is a buyout every day is like saying second coming will be tomorrow, it gets old. With the shorts, you guys clearly have found the right stock to work on considering how quiet the board and management are, and bravo to that. To anyone new here, this is probably the most frustrating. The management and PR team for this stock are very quiet. Because this is a one-product company, they cannot bring the same hype that other pharma have with a pipeline. This leads to wild speculation. Overall, this is a sure stock. Why? Because it has low debt and a profitable market. It is frustrating seeing other stocks in phase II trials in the double digits while we are going back to $2.50. I look it as an opportunity to buy more as this will be going into full pump early next week. Enjoy the ride everyone, and make sure to take some profits along the way or hold long term."

"I'm no Wall Street wizard, but I do know you always polish the apple in order to get the best price. A buyer ALWAYS points to the negative. Buyer - you don't have enough money to get this to market - Seller - announce the acquiring of adequate funding. Buyer - I can go into production quicker than you can - Seller - announce the commencement of production. Buyer - I already have a sales force - Seller - leak information on the hiring of a sales force. A good seller ALWAYS responds to and overcomes objections which could diminish the price. Sounds to me like EVOKE management may be jockeying for a better deal than what is being offered - kind of polishing the apple."

Merck's Monupiravir will be the first pill form therapy for people recently infected with coronavirus if approved. Those having erratic oral med absorption then would need a helping agent like nasal spray Gimoti. Good news.
At this point I will settle for a break even buyout.

"this cost about 17$ per spray, and it's at 15 mg. reglan cost $380 for 100 pills but for 5mg. assuming people take 2 pills to get to 10 mg. the cost would be $7.6 per usage. but if people who use 15mg of reglan, then the price per use is about $11.4, so it's not actually too far off"

There are processes that have to be completed for this to reach full potential and some state programs won’t even consider it till mid year! I’m not in this game to flip and make pennies when the real play is dollars that come with time! Liquidate if you wish and buy into some crypto if that’s your game but for my holdings they will sit tight for the long run.

"In rebuttal to several statements; no buyouts at this time due to pandemic and/or no multiple hundred percent buyout price, see the following. https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/bayer-womens-health-acquisition-kandy/583293/So just for fun, if Evoke is bought for the same $425m / 24m shares = $17.88/share = 343% of our current share price of $5.15. And if certain benchmarks are met they get another $450m on top of that would result in a $875m total buyout for a price of $36.45 per share, a 708% payout. (from the example using Evoke share price and number of shares). It can happen."

Current management for diabetic gastroparesis focuses on dietary and lifestyle changes as well as improved glycemic control. Limited options for medical therapies are available that include prokinetic and antiemetic medications that are available over the counter. About 40% of people with diabetic gastroparesis will improve with Erythromycin Metoclopramide is the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of gastroparesis. Extended treatment presents challenges such as decreased efficacy over time and increased risks for adverse events. Prescriptions for 35 year old metoclopramide have decreased yearly since FDA ordered black box warning in 2009.
Don't forget this is a highly overpriced version of an ancient generic product in a flooded space .Remember current management for diabetic gastroparesis focuses on dietary and lifestyle changes as well as improved glycemic control.

I again in courage all you long time suffers like myself do not sell, a buy out, merger, temporary approval, or full approval can happen at anytime. Especially with this ownership, I would hate to see a long time investor sufferer like myself not be rewarded. They definitely will receive their approval, after their 90 day test was successful, which again was not required by the FDA. That means final FDA Submittal was excepted and we don’t know when they actually handed it in. Evoke is definitely talking to large Pharma’s about a buy out or merger after FDA accepted final package."
"Don't forget this company's nose spray doesn't replace ""existing "" less effective treatments and is not for fatal or debilitating diseases. Remember, Gimoti, a 13 yr old reformulation of a 40 yr old generic, is part of the Dopamine Receptor Antagonists class and treats DPg. Dopamine receptor antagonists are used to treat nausea and heartburn associated with GERD."
Let’s go ER time 
"Well it is time for everyone to buy, let’s get ride of all these 5 and 10 share shorter’s. Everyone should purchase shares at this low price, let’s make shorter’s pay the price. We all know the management plays the game. Management/hedge funds laughing watching all this short money pour in. At anytime they will pull the trigger, purchase all shares up to 4.00 dollars. Then quickly follow with a announcement, this will push stock to 5 dollars. Shorter’s in for a very big surprise, this will happen real soon. What a set up this is, It takes one guy to buy 100,000 shares with one push of the button. This has happened several time in the past 2 months. This has a 9 billion dollar world wide sales potential, they have been given approval for a licence to print . Do you not think several large Pharma companies are in discussion to purchase this."
Financials are out.With a POSITIVE STATEMENT from Management concerning resubmitting to FDA
California Medicaid covers this drug. So are Medicare. That means there will be tire kickers like them or not.
"Biotechs all go down because Warren Buffett was selling and who can blame him? Covid is not going away after all. 100,000 positives everyday and it's not Fall yet. And treatment available are oral medications to relieve fever and aching pain and ... rest at home. Which means that Eversana if it is savyy could start selling Gimoti to diabetics to help them absorb these oral medications for their fever. When fever hits 43 C or 109 F people die."

"Will we go below $1 today? Gonyer and D'Onofrio don't seem to care. Gonyer and D'Onofrio received nearly 2 million in total compensation in 2020. While they own thousands of Evoke shares and would surely benefit from share price appreciation, they seem content to milk shareholders for the 2 million in compensation. Neither man has any experience actually running a company and it shows. Yale Jen is one of the analysts that covers this stock and he is totally worthless. He won't ask the tough questions that need to be asked of management and Evoke won't let shareholders ask question on earnings conference calls. We as shareholders are at the mercy of incompetent management and I'm not sure how we fix the problem."
"60K shares exchanged hands during trading hours, and 37K after-hours. Might be an interesting start to the day tomorrow."
"There is hardly any shares traded everyday. This show a good strong sign that most have been purchased by the longs. Everyone must remember on a new product launch it takes time, especially with the Covid restrictions. I am sure the last 2 months the sales have really started to pick up. Company does not owe a lot of money, very low monthly expenses. It is really odd that the results will be revealed after market on Thursday. We may see a buyout announcement, which would make sense after market heading into a Friday of celebration. Either way I do believe we will have positive news moving forward. They are definitely trying to sell the company and have gotten their number they are looking for. This is why they began a sale campaign. Trying to create a market and add value for a more lucrative buyout."
Being day traded. Will be green at close
"The real truth, for what I have read on this board, nobody is completely informed about the pricing structure. And I know that because all the controversial “facts” that diferente people post. It’s here where we deserve some kind of PR from the company, that is at least factual, if not complete."
"Minimum $10 with stuff. Approximately 162% growth in product sales, 152% growth in prescriptions and 57% increase in new prescribers for GimotiExtends cash runway into third quarter of 2022"
"Appalling. 240,000 diabetic patients died of Covid in their own home or have gotten too sick in their home before going to ER when it is too late. If specialist have had concerned that 20%+ of diabetic patients were not getting oral medications absorbed then this nasal spray could have helped those 20%. That's 48,000 patients!RIP."
"As most of us investor know, EVOK is in the final stage of FDA approval of a drug for Gastoparesis with an EBITDA potential of 75m. The drug, Gimoti Novel Nasal Spray, will be commercialised in partnership with Eversana, which will free EVOK from major launch costs but also retaining 80% of sales revenue.There is an estimated upside with target share price of at least 10 dollars a share, so about 1000% from where we are now."
Don't forget greatly overpriced metoclopramide nose spray drug isn't needed for diabetic gastroparesis and will never take off. Remember Current management for diabetic gastroparesis focuses on dietary and lifestyle changes as well as improved glycemic control. Prescriptions for 35yr old metoclopramide have decreased yearly since FDA ordered black box warning in 2009. There's cheaper forms of generic metoclopramide such as dissolve in mouth tabs and countless over the counter GERD drugs used.
"Evoke Pharma inc Please give the shareholders some more awesome news before June 19th FDA approval. The news of the FDA accepting the Name ""Gimoti"" for Metoclopramide nasal spray was awesome when Evoke shared the information with the shareholders and markets."
"i like bargains like netlist,amc,mesoblast,...bought evok @1,3 TODAY diamond hands"
18m shares changing hands could easily be a hostile takeover without any hostility. buy up the rest at 2$ after hours and you and i are out.
"Let’s analyze this; Evoke pharma, under 40 million shares, 40% owned by management and institutional, along with Amori owning another 18 percent. That leaves very few shares up for grabs as 25 percent of publicly traded shares are bought and they are holding onto them waiting for full approval. They have a developed market of 3-4 billion in sales. They have partnered with Novus, a top line manufacturer/distributor. Upon approval, this should exceed $10.00 in 30 days, or less, if it follows recent other pharmaceutical 3rd phase resubmitted approvals. This next couple days Evoke management will announce they have submitted final submission. There are limited shares to be had, so Evoke interested investors will be jumping all over this!! Our patience will finally pay off!!"
150k I would think
So no earnings posted yesterday what are we in for?
Yeah only know negatives about management so I think I’ll buy some puts here
"I seriously had my doubts about the sales potential, but it seems to be picking up. Best short term scenario is when EVOK runs out of cash and has to sell itself"
I feel a buyout coming in Q1 2022
"I just want to respond to all you negative people and those that think I am pumping this stock. There is nothing to pump about a medical drug this is about to get its approval. The Drug was approved in 1989 in a pill/inject form. The sales last year for these suffers was was roughly 3.5 billion dollars in the USA alone. There are very limited shares available in circulation or overall in the company. I have invested very large dollars in Evoke Pharma which I will finally benefit after 5 years of ups and downs. I did sell half my position 3 years ago when before the third phase trial result, the stock had reached 12.60. I was up 280,000 dollars sold just over Half my shares. I am not pumping this stock that is so under valued it is not funny. Remember 3 phase not finally approval we were at 12.60. Here we are at 1.57 with a announcement of final Submission and could receive a 2 b at the meeting. This means temporary passing to start manufacturing and selling. We are only at 1.57 which makes zero sense when 6 times we were over 5 dollars and not at the final approval stage. Think about it I am actually trying to convince people to buy that will thank me when the stock reaches 15 to 20 dollars a share. They say risk and reward, well there is no risk at this stage only a reward. They stock upon the announcement of final submission will reach over 5 dollars with in a week. The FDA with recent other final re subs with little info requested by FDA receive a 2b temporary or final passing with in a 30 or less days or less. With under 40 million shares in total and in the usa established sales of 3 to 4 billion for the taking this company will sell for no less then 15 dollars a share. There will be a lot of in and out investors that have purchased this stock over the years that will be sorry. Evoke has a date with the FDA for a meeting and a final Submission 60 days ago or longer. When you re submit or hand in your final submission, the procedure is call for a date 60 days prior for a live meeting with the FDA and a final review and then approval to hand in your final submission.Evoke will be handing in their final submission before the end of this year. I have been in contact with various management for 5 long years and they did confirm they were going to re submit their final Submission before the end of the year. So those that own share when announcement any day or time is made will be the winners of a lottery. Those that don’t will scramble to purchase limited shares, as this will sky rocket upon announcement.So once again I am in for over 200,000 k, not a pumper a realist that people that own the shares will greatly benefit."
tomorrow is the day boys. hope we go to mars
Any ideas on how many shares FBR is adding today ?
"Got this reply Samia, thank you for your email. The company has partnered with Eversana for the commercialization of Gimoti. EVERSANA will fund and commercialize Gimoti and manage substantially all activities related to marketing, market access, distribution, sales team, patient reimbursement, and provide related support services. Evoke expects to initiate commercial sales of Gimoti in the fourth quarter of 2020."
Congrats to those who stayed loyal. Stock market is all about fluctuation. Those who are patient make money. Great things ahead for those who are going to hold. Easy $10 from here
"@KC, ""Black box warning""? - what do you mean by it?From where did you get all this staff: ""...no significant difference in the reduction in symptom scores between the spray and placebo groups"", ""...more costly than other drugs"",""...extreme risk if used concomitantly with other commonly prescribed drugs""?"
"@Sharon - someone is buying big chunks of this daily and clearly manipulating the SP. As this company is worth $1bn+, they can afford to sell lots of shares in low volume and continually at a lower price, they can easily afford to in order to shake the weak hands. Perhaps the new share issue (see the SEC filing - they were bought by one company and split 3 ways within that company - Hirschman) was a way to ensure the buying company (e.g Bausch) doesn't acquire 50% or more of the stock... perhaps Bausch are close to that? That's precisely why Gonyer set up 100m shares to release IF he needs to in order to retain control. Gonyer had $6m at end of December (unaudited, notably) according to a recent press release - he didn't need the money - especially so since this assumes no sales have occurred in the last quarter. Analysts predict $15m for the first year..... extraordinarily low and this revenue was based on low prices for GIMOTI and as we all know now, its actually a very high price. Strange that no analyst has focussed on this stock and found that out, EXCEPT Seeking Alpha who aren't on the list of analysts for this stock."
I’m to unexperienced to understand why this is dropping -8% after stating they will produce the med and they will sell it sooner then expected?? Somebody explain me?
Down 30% in 6 days. There are no words to describe that which yahoo will allow.
So not too bad and good stuff coming let’s roll!!!
"Be advised, Gimoti has no FDA exclusivity. Quality drugs receive years of FDA exclusivity. This means a competitor can come in and market another generic metoclopramide nasal spray. Gimoti U.S. patent 6770262 expires 03/29/2021. U.S. patent 8334281 validity wide open to challenges."
"Remember this is after hours trading - not full market. Also news at the end of a Friday afternoon when many already gone for weekend. I’m sure there will be a great deal of analysis done over the weekend and we’ll see a nice price pop on Monday. Be happy, enjoy the weekend!"
"this really seems fishy. big improvements everywhere, patent, insurance, data, sales, but stock price is down this much for really no reason. something is up"
BACK IN THE GAME WITH 7000 SHARES LETS GO!!!!!!!
So anyone that bought after the approval is now a bagholder. Great stock isnt it ? Good things are coming EVENTUALLY. If we all have the discipline to hold.GLTA
"Excellent partnership agreement!They decided to go big by establishing projected sale figures for the product first. This may be worth a billion or a bust. The company practically own Metoclopramide going forward with parents and discovery, and being one of 100 essential medicines, this is exciting time for shareholders."
"Im in,,,,could very well be a rocket,,,revenue,,,patents and low shares outstanding,,,very rare to see 7 - 8 analyst having a strong buy rating on a small bio tech....."
Reminders: 1. Evok to SEC 8/6/20 - The Company believes that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date these financial statements are issued. 2. FDA only approved gimoti for Diabetic Gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is listed as a RARE Disease by NORD ( National Organization of Rare Disorders ). It has multiple divisions only ONE of which is Diabetic Gastroparesis. 3. Vast majority of diabetics take pills and the few who only inject insulin would have issues with a expensive version of a 40 year old generic drug and easily deal with cheap injectable or melt on tongue or oral liquid generic. metoclopramide.

"Hedge funds managers bet $100s of millions among themselves on Zogenix brought back Fenphen, evidently hoping for billion of dollars. This is Z only drug on market and there is little hope of them getting money back with sales withering. Z stock will crater in 1 or 2 quarters. Let them die, no merger with Evoke."
"Well, Evoke Gimoti Nasal Spray almost triple revenue sales 2nd quarter, $237,000 from 1st quarter $90,000. 3rd quarter could be another triple hitter or better."
"20% of Market opportunity of $2B is $400M. 80% for@Evoke ($320M) & 20% for Eversana. Current Market cap is about $59M.Outstanding shares $24M.Based on the above facts, if approved tomorrow, potential stock price should rise substantially!!!!!"
"The high of the day on Evoke one year ago today on wed, 10/14/20 was 5.00. Was down 70% from there a few weeks ago. Thanks for nothing Goyner."
"I am, and have always been a huge technical analysis trader, so here are my thoughts.......For those of you frustrated, impatient, etc. with EVOK, consider the following. It is widely regarded that exponential moving averages are an indication of the trend of the stock. One of the most commonly used (which is what I use the most) is the 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages. If the 10-day is above the 20-day, then the stock is in an uptrend and if the 20 is above the 10, it is in a downtrend. When these moving averages cross each other, that indicates a change in the trend. Well, EVOK had the upward bullish crossover on April 14 this year. Ever since, price has been going up with normal, healthy pullbacks. The more space between the averages, the stronger the trend. These averages act as huge support/resistance levels during the trend. If you go back and look starting on the crossover on April 14th, there have only been 2 daily candles that closed below the 20-day and that was right after the crossover. Since, we have closed above the 10-day every single day, and closed above the 20-day almost every single day bouncing off those support areas on the way up. Now, after the huge spike up on the news, we got a nice gap in space between the averages, but way too far away from them. Price needs to pull back just a bit to allow time for those moving averages to catch up before the next leg up, which is what is happening now. Price is at $3.47 and the 10-day is slowly catching up at $3.27. If we don't move higher from here, I'm guessing it will catch up to price within the next 5 trading days or so. Also, we obviously have a nice consolidation support base building out here in the $3.30 - $3.40 level with lots of wicks to the downside on the daily candles, which is extremely important. So when the averages catch up, we will have an unbreakable support area and shorts will have to cover. In addition to the averages, I love to use the RSI indicator to determine overbought and oversold levels. For those unfamiliar, an RSI of 70 or greater is overbought and an RSI of 30 or lower is oversold. Well, since the pop on FDA approval news (RSI at 78 that day), RSI has been above or close to 70 so it makes since for price to pullback from profit taking. If you go back and look at EVOK since that April 14th crossover, every time RSI got above 70, it pulled back. Every. Single. Time. Ok, so just in the last 2 trading days, we have finally gotten below 70 and are currently at 66 which means we are getting closer to the point where price is ready for another leg up. So why am I saying all this? Look, I'm just as impatient as the next guy wanting this to hit the $10 target tomorrow, but that's just not how the stock market works. I've been looking at charts for over 12 years. Right now, EVOK's market cap is a laughable 85 million. You don't think it could be 300 or 400 with the approved drug that works better than the oral method that's ineffective in many cases once they commercialize and start distribution later this year? Uh, yeah I do. That's a quadruple or quintuple on price. So relax, be patient and let the technicals do their thing. The market makers and institutions play the technical game well and you must wait/trade accordingly with them. If you're not willing to wait, my suggestion would be to sell, move on, and come back to the chart in a few months filled with regret. I'm normally a day trader, but I see so much potential in this that I've decided to let this be one of the few stocks that I add to the long-term portfolio to wait out to catch the whale. Good luck guys!"
"This nasal spray proves a 4 to 1 advantage over the older product of needles and pills. The Needles aNd pills products 3 billion in sales. Gimoti has the potential of 9 billion world wide. It also has multiple other usage for other suffers like migraine headache, various cancer suffers. The company will sell for sell over 20 dollars a share. He will not be going into production like he says in 30 days. He has always sold all his Pharma FDA approved drugs. With only 48 million total share this is a no brainer. Even If he does start the sells, which they have already started manufacturing, this stock will skyrocket with amount of revenue they will quickly generate. Remember they have a huge established client base. They have been purchasing less effective pills/needles and huge side effect since 1989. https://twitter.com/homeSent from my iPad"
Let's drill down into this microcaps weak form of a 35 yr old generic... as already mentioned regardless of Evoke Pharma's corporate propaganda the FDA only approved gimoti for Diabetic Gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is listed as a RARE Disease by NORD ( National Organization of Rare Disorders ). It has multiple divisions only ONE of which is Diabetic Gastroparesis. The FDA did NOT approve Gimoti for all forms of the rare disorder or any other disease or disorder. FDA plans post approval evaluation of Gimoti (metoclopramide) nasal spray risks and safety in the Sentinel System. Because Gimoti will likely be infrequently prescribed since it's indicated Only for a scare patient sub-population of a multi- division rare disease its commercial success is highly unlikely.
Massive volume as well that means someone may be buying them out.
EVOK is nearing NDA completion. When approved should be worth $12-15/share
"do people realize this company is valued at $22million...not $100 million, not $75-- $22 MiLLION!! You think there is any growth opportunities with a low outstanding share count and a valuation of $22 million, not including a major company event on the horizon. Ok, you sell at these levels--can you find any better investment opportunities out there??"
"Any reason this stock is plummeting? All I see are good news, but it just keeps going down. Are any of the Q2 numbers negative? Am I missing something?"
@mark and @sellhi...There's going to be a positive reaction to this call. Just buy and make money...
they won a sales award eh. check linkedin
I heard Martin Shkreli will be doubling the price to $3400 per container after his purchase of the company for $3.25 per share.
"This company knows its worth; they mentioned Dr. Henry Parkman in their NR. They mentioned money runway to July 2021. Their product will hit the market in 2 months. All this adds strength, it will take some serious back and for negotiations before any deal. BO outlook is 6 months out."
Who gives a hood for a buyout dog biscuit? Nobody. Investors are not dogs. Spray away sales aid was fortunate. Versa Zogenix. Unfortunately someone has died on their clinical trial even though it was thought not to be related to the trial itself. Incidental death from heart valves or lungs considering their drug history!!??? It spooks!
"What does this mean in practice?BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTEvoke intends to continue to expand its pipeline of product candidates in its key focus area of gastroenterology disorders.

"Friends It seems like it is not covered by a lot of insurance plans. Big red flag for sales ability. I have Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. They cover dispersable metoclopramide ( dissolves in mouth ) as a tier 1 drug (lowest copy). Gimoti's not available. Their formulary was updated in 11/20 and includes drugs FDA approved thru 11/1/20. A red flag is also the short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker EVOK is 52% on Nov 20, 2020."
Why did we go up at the end of last Friday? Any good news?
no volume. what is going on? potential buyout?
"In the conference call it was mentioned Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance carriers be covering Gimoti. The company also mention about manufacturing Gimoti nasal spray in smaller size dosages Containers, so it can be more affordable. Evoke Pharma Inc need to release this news information in a formal press release next week"
The FDA website updated and has two approvals listed for today. News should be out soon then.
thankyou so much to the new owner of my bags!
So little volume lately must wonder if insiders or paid promo firms are playing share ping pong to game pps. Certainly not unheard of with small penny's stocks like this one.
"As big a struggle this has been, at least sales are increasing. SLOWLY, but increasing none the less.GLTA"
I’m making so much money today. I may buy a share of Evoke just to remind me what not to do!
"Dave Gonyer said in the YouTube video that ""once you have the product and have a sales team out there, people start calling you and we're always open to opportunities"" not the exact wording. but I would think that he's saying that companies did call about opportunities to maybe buy them out and they're open to it. just my 2 cent"
Eat your hearts out shorties 
"Don't forget the domestic population Gimoti is to be used for is limited and miniscule, and can only be used for short duration - Talk to any GP, GI, Endo doc that knows their stuff. Won't be impactful or have meaningful sales/revenues, FDA says it has less than 50% bioavailability and it systemic absorption is lower than cheaper already available treatments it will be more expensive and less effective than current SOC. Since operating expenses went up astoundingly before selling has even started costs related to selling will increase expenses more and not help bottom line.Remember with them going it alone and with company being so terribly overvalued with small # employees and shares it would be very profitable for a raider to come in and liquidate this company. It should be trading at less than 2 dollars."
"With a 24 million share float, and over 6 million shares traded after hours on Friday, I would expect a lot of volatility on Monday. I believe GNUS went to 11/share with 4 times the float, and JFIN touched about 30/share on twice the float, so this should be very interesting. I’m guessing that we will see at least $15/share on Monday. Any other predictions?"
"According to pharmacokinetic data, the systemic absorption of metoclopramide after nasal administration is lower than that after oral administration given the same dose.https://www.empr.com/home/news/gimoti-metoclopramide-now-available-nasal-spray-diabetic-gastroparesis/"

"The difference between Zogenix and Evoke is like night and day.Z is heavily bet on by hedge funds and E is like poor little stepsister Cinderella...Z drug was once a multiple billion dollars diet pill that the FDA has pulled and will never ever again be anything other than a drug for a rare disease, an orphan drug under any other designation. E drug was approved by the FDA after failing flat pivotal phase 3 at 5mg dose. The FDA approved a 15mg dose, 3 times the original dose seeking!Place your bet now hedge funds."
"evoke, please go super saiyan tomorrow"
"Market makers have the day off here, perhaps a good sign."
Goooood morning. today is June 4th. we have 15 days until approval
