"Small retail sellers today selling thinking this is a virus-related company and there are better stocks to own on the opening of the economy. With the restoration of some normalcy, SCI will benefit greatly as well and the virus has hurt more than helped it."
"If the Death care industry was dying , How did SCI stock go from $2.00 to $45.00 from 2000 to 2020 ?"
"The stock market is a forward looking mechanism, and the COVID pandemic is hopefully a onetime event. They seem to be forecasting a return to normal but increased growth by 2022 compared with 2019. The management team is communicating a responsible forecast to the street. We will enjoy the unfortunate bump in profit, but long term investors will stay long and strong with the demographic trend in place."
"To all the hard working people at SCI ,thank you."
Wonderful wonderful opportunity thanks again for your kindness sharing
I will wait for the COVID deaths to fade before I buy into this one. I see it falling back to about $55.00
"I remember SCI at $3 when they almost went bankruptnow RIG, NE & XES look the same"
"Great 4Q, earnings at$1.13 from last quarter of $.88 or 28% increase. An easy $58-60 on horizon."
"SCI had a not so good 2020, up 6% for the year despite being given a strong buy rating by analysts. It had an almost 21% increase the previous 5 years."
"Funerals can be traced back to the dawn of mankind. This is one event that will not go virtual. This is the dominant player in the funeral business and the higher ups will do anything to benefit shareholders. Love this company. Buy, buy, buy."
EPS of $1.33 vs consensus estimates of $0.99 AND increased guidance ! Wow! On top of an already outstanding stock buyback program. This company is the real deal folks. Just buy it and forget about it.
Why isn't this stock much higher?
"1/2 BILLION buy back on top of a $210 mill dollar buy back, on top of the best 1/4 results ever on top of debt restructuring . Good job SCI ."
So what happens with all the meat in trailers at some point they have to bury it. Ashes to Ashes Dust to Dust the market plays games but its all about luck
"This stock is easy money. Just buy, hold, and buy some more."
"Hmmm...don't get it. Stock was up before earnings call, which was actually pretty good. The dividend payout ratio is low, and the dividend keeps going up. It isn't a growth stock, but its solid. And its definitely not a tech stock. So is that the reason for the fade?"
Lets see how many short bodies Raymond James leaves on the path to $47. Up nice this morning pre-market
The. bodies are everywhere
Boosters are here to power Sci to triple digits
"Earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years, there is significant insider selling, it pays a paltry dividend. I sold out today near it's all time high and I feel good about it. It may do well for awhile longer but there are better stocks out there."
Just be patient and wait. History always repeats itself and so do stock prices.https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/dead-bodies-pile-up-outside-nyc-funeral-home-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/?fbclid=IwAR0_2GwHFUU2YVKDQpPJAuk0po8qdMRCwgye9hvf36gzbcBBLrc93Lny_Ss
Service is up 5.14% to 66.65
"I understand that this isn't a stock to get excited about, but its dividend payout and buyback profile seems to be in order. Sales aren't going to grow exponentially (at least we hope so), but neither are they going to fall off the table. The dividend has been increasing year after year. So...a steady, slightly growing company, with decent prospects."
You would think the stock of a US funeral company would rise dramatically if there was truly a pandemic.
“all time high”
the stock you will all invest in. You can't stop death..
It is a crime against humanity pushing these death jabs. sci will benefit from it. lots of manipulation with mrna and bntx. shorting takes lots of guts with these wall street manipulation.
Service reached an all time high at 68.97
This earnings confirmed increasing deaths in the society. You know the cause.
Earnings call must not be to impressive pre market
Reality will come soon enough.$50 https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/coronavirus-overwhelmed-funeral-homes-turn-families-200407142603912.html
Another blowout earning. Much strong than last year even w payroll tax this year
"Good quarter. .72/share, and I imagine (sadly) since COVID is peaking that the next quarter will also be good. There will probably be a bump up in the dividend in March. The question is whether it would be .01 or .02."
Consistent growth deserves high multiples
I hope this isn’t dead money the CC better be happy and not morbid like the financials
"Sooner or later, the dead will need cremates/burial. If SCI, one of the major players in the US funerary industry can't find a way for their stock to capitalize on that, they need to do something else."
Service reached an all time high at 66.44
Funny how Cramer was saying SCI isn’t a buy at 40 either. Not in his portfolio. It can and probably will go much higher and still will be saying SCI isn’t a buy. I have been buying this stock for many years and it was and still is one of my best picks.
"I purchased shares of SCI at $17.56. Smart buy. Every astute investor ought to have exposure to the Death care industry. Today, an average funeral costs over $8,000.And oh, by the way, a reminder that death is life's partner. Nothing is more certain and SCI is the largest funeral company in the country..I continue to buy more shares."
Death and taxes are the only things you can't escape from paying. SCI has been very good to me over the years it is a long term stock. it's not a day traders stock.
