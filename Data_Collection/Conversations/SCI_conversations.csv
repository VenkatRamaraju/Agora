"Trying to refinance $850 mil....going from 5.375% to 3.375%. If they can pull this off, its all going to the bottom line. Great move."
Why isn't this stock much higher?
This stock should skyrocket with this virus. 10x stronger then the flu.
SCI reached an all time high at 50.70
just bought it for my wife's ROTH ira.
"I purchased shares of SCI at $17.56. Smart buy. Every astute investor ought to have exposure to the Death care industry. Today, an average funeral costs over $8,000.And oh, by the way, a reminder that death is life's partner. Nothing is more certain and SCI is the largest funeral company in the country..I continue to buy more shares."
why dis die
SCI is down 4.97% to 47.13
"Sooner or later, the dead will need cremates/burial. If SCI, one of the major players in the US funerary industry can't find a way for their stock to capitalize on that, they need to do something else."
This stock is to die for. One of the Best long term hold in my portfolio
SCI is down 5.39% to $40.36
The. bodies are everywhere
You all will do better in an index fund. Just compare it over the last 10 years
"sales should be same or better then last 1/4 . Sci will probably start the 1/2 billion buyback before dividend payment in Sept,"
Would you buy now or wait for a possible small pullback?
SCI reached an all time high at 50.88

Funerals are back sooner than forecasted.
"SCI had a not so good 2020, up 6% for the year despite being given a strong buy rating by analysts. It had an almost 21% increase the previous 5 years."
EPS of $1.33 vs consensus estimates of $0.99 AND increased guidance ! Wow! On top of an already outstanding stock buyback program. This company is the real deal folks. Just buy it and forget about it.

"Hmmm...if the flu is going to be as bad this year as health experts think, does that bode well for SCI? Its been on the downslope for the past few days, even when the market is up. Any thoughts...can we look forward to another dividend increase next year...to .19 per quarter?"

This stock should be indifferent to virus developments--it has a base level of revenues no matter what.
"I expect this stock to take off this year. The NWO wants to reduce the world population, and not by just a little bit."
coming death waves from the death jabs will be unimaginable.
"Its called a Biden/Pelosi Pandemic, its purpose is to get rid of Trump. But the fact is they have to destroy the life savings and retirement dreams of whole class of people.."

Great quarter!

"Small retail sellers today selling thinking this is a virus-related company and there are better stocks to own on the opening of the economy. With the restoration of some normalcy, SCI will benefit greatly as well and the virus has hurt more than helped it."
"Good quarter. .72/share, and I imagine (sadly) since COVID is peaking that the next quarter will also be good. There will probably be a bump up in the dividend in March. The question is whether it would be .01 or .02."
SCI is down 6.97% to 43.80
"With a steady reduction in burial plot sales over the last two decades, and the drastic increase in cremation services, how is SCI adjusting?"
I don't think the Chinese tariffs or inversion of the yield curve will have much impact on SCI....
“all time high”
"With the Virus less people die, no one on the roads, nobody doing anything. That's why it went down. Plus the covid-19 fears. are over blown."
Wow. Was hoping that the div would get bumped in March but got bumped now... .02 per share.

"This stock is easy money. Just buy, hold, and buy some more."
http://www.wsj.com/articles/funeral-industry-seeks-ways-to-stay-relevant-1478178000
"One of the worst companies in America. They don't give a #$%$ about employees or clients who are seeking comfort during a difficult time. I would never use this corporation for services as they have many facilities that do not do what they are paid to do. In other words, the cremation remains you receive are not the ones of your loved one or they store remains in hidden places. Trust me, do some research on this company and you will find a long list of violations at their facilities. Their CEO and CFO are vultures, especially the CFO, Eric T who loves to fly the corporation jet and is extremely overpaid for his knowledge, Board of Directors, wake up and fix this company. Any company can grow on death care but it is a shame it grows on greed."
"The stock market is a forward looking mechanism, and the COVID pandemic is hopefully a onetime event. They seem to be forecasting a return to normal but increased growth by 2022 compared with 2019. The management team is communicating a responsible forecast to the street. We will enjoy the unfortunate bump in profit, but long term investors will stay long and strong with the demographic trend in place."
Death and taxes are the only things you can't escape from paying. SCI has been very good to me over the years it is a long term stock. it's not a day traders stock.
They charge more for embalming to for hazardous cases
More jabs more power to Sci
"SCI is perhaps the lowest maintenance stock you could hope for. Leaders of their industry, with a built-in profitability. Not a flashy name you hear about a lot, but a reliable one."
Recent articles miss the point on demographics in the U.S.A. We are headed to 20% of our population over the age of 65 by 2030.
the stock you will all invest in. You can't stop death..

"boosters coming, deaths spiking up."
What's driving SCI up?
Backward State!!! http://www.startribune.com/wisconsin-court-upholds-ban-on-cemeteries-funeral-homes/486685341/
"Lets see we will have 2 trillion of inflation in the next year or two. The most expensive real estate in the world (cemetery plots). A Pandemic , A blowout last 1/4 . A $250,000,000. buyback last year and $500,000,000. buy back this year . ( 10% of outstanding stock). OH yah the pandemic ! Baby Boomers will hit the average death rate this year. This is a cash cow for sale at about a 15% discount from it's 52 week high. I can't wait for next 1/4 and next10 years. great job Sci, and keep up the good work."
"If you have not added this quality, extremely relevant company to your portfolio by now....I submit that you are a fool. Plain. Simple. Honest.I purchased shares of SCI at $17.56. Smart buy. Every astute investor ought to have exposure to the Death care industry. Today, an average funeral costs over $8,000.And oh, by the way, a reminder that death is life's partner. Nothing is more certain and SCI is the largest funeral company in the country..I continue to buy more shares."
"Anyone know why SCI isn't in the S&P 500? Its market cap is almost twice that of PDCO, which is. Getting added to the S&P 500 would mean a lot of index funds would be buying and really boost the stock price."
"Your stock value just went up 5.9% .Thanks to the $ 500,000,000,.00 buyback. just wait and see ."
I would like to know why this piece of garbage has a 1.5 buy rating for going on 2 years? It has been a dog since I bought almost 3 years ago. Not to be conspiratorial but something is definitively amiss with this rating.
It is a crime against humanity pushing these death jabs. sci will benefit from it. lots of manipulation with mrna and bntx. shorting takes lots of guts with these wall street manipulation.
I'm thinking there's going to be another dividend hike next March.
Stock is either a buy or overweight.

Looks cheap. Buy at 33
I too looked at this as a huge opportunity but they know the death rates wont increase anymore than last year as these CVD19 deaths are all tied to the common flu death rate and this year because of mild weather in the northeast it will be less than last year.
Funny how Cramer was saying SCI isn’t a buy at 40 either. Not in his portfolio. It can and probably will go much higher and still will be saying SCI isn’t a buy. I have been buying this stock for many years and it was and still is one of my best picks.
"To all the hard working people at SCI ,thank you."
SCI is up 5.88% to 38.89
"I understand that this isn't a stock to get excited about, but its dividend payout and buyback profile seems to be in order. Sales aren't going to grow exponentially (at least we hope so), but neither are they going to fall off the table. The dividend has been increasing year after year. So...a steady, slightly growing company, with decent prospects."
How is it possible for this stock to lose value? Don't get it.
Boosters are here to power Sci to triple digits

"SCI is one of the worst companies in the world. They grew too fast, tried to expand too quickly in Europe, and domestically have little control of the local funeral homes they gobbled up. Dead bodies everywhere but the proper graves. Shameful, unethical, greedy and ugly. Both CEO and especially the CFO grossly overpaid and not worth it. Was, at one time a good company but now, it is an embarrassment to the industry. They charge exorbitant prices for funerals (my wife's was $15,000) by upselling you on caskets and misc. services when they know you are vulnerable. Shame on you Tom, Eric and the Board of Directors. Have you now shame or guilt?"
Earnings call must not be to impressive pre market

Ask the richest person buried in the cemetery if they are happy. I like the business but do not want to be on the shovel end adding to the bottom line at this time.
Thumbs up for a buy or down for the sell.I sense opportunity for great couple quarters.

Broken stock. Accounting irregularities??
Wonderful wonderful opportunity thanks again for your kindness sharing
"Starting to look interesting as a medium term buy and hold. The virus seems to be thriving in Africa, despite hotter weather than North America right now, so it does not look like it will go away anytime soon. Helpful drugs and medicines may be found, and vaccines are not impossible but my best guess is that they might work for a percentage of the population, rather than give immunity."
"SCI was one of the first corporate ventures into funeral service and has tried to become the Amazon without cost savings to the customer .This company has had so many lawsuits for wrong doing in their cemetery operation nationwide ,all from greed and poor judgement .So many of it's Management decisions have been suits over improper use of prepaid preneed funeral accounts . Management has had many problems with wrongdoing at it's Jewish cemeteries .Like all corporate entities emphisis in strictly on the bottom line and not ethics .They like their close associate corporation ,Carriage Services have done much to devistate personal local funeral service .At decades of these corporations the American family has chosen less traditional services which inturn yield lower income and a predicted downturn in income and a doubtful future .Big is not better."
where is the bottom here

"Market is irrational. If you buy all the virus end of world BS, then this stock that handles the dead should be $50-$60 not going down!"
Service Corp is down 6.81% to 48.04
Lots of positive posts but in the nearly 2 years I have owned this stock it hasn't done jack. Not even a pandemic has helped it.
You would think the stock of a US funeral company would rise dramatically if there was truly a pandemic.
SCI is up 5.57% to 43.96
"You should not be in this for the pandemic, you should be in this because in the next 10-20 years our society is going to need a lot of baby boomer funerals."
"When I bought this company's stock I thought it dealt with the dead, not that the company was dead. Half a million additional deaths due to the pandemic and this garbage company is down over 5% year for the year."

Chart looks good for a breakout here

this will be the stock to own coming 1-2 yrs.
"Ah yes, SCI sold a downtown Atlanta funeral home for....$40mil. I wonder what value they were carrying it on the books. They've got quite a few funeral homes that are in urban areas that could bring in quite a profit. I believe there's some in Chicago that they've had since the 60's, and they're probably on the books for pennies for what they could get."
"Funerals can be traced back to the dawn of mankind. This is one event that will not go virtual. This is the dominant player in the funeral business and the higher ups will do anything to benefit shareholders. Love this company. Buy, buy, buy."
Can anyone explain why SCI isn't included in the S&P 500? Its market cap is certainly larger than a number of companies in the index. Just asking....
"Think about it you can make more money digging a cemetery plot, than digging for gold!"
Yet another monster earnings beat. The management team and industry make this a must own stock.
This is terrible but you have to figure in Sept when the Cov19 comes back with a vengeance this stock will be in the 50s by then. Meat is meat you either eat it or bury it
Service Corp is up 4.91% to 55.93
What's next for the dividend?
This just one of the most frustrating stocks I have ever owned. I've owned it for 3 years and it is a disappointment. It's not a loser but it's not much if a winner either. I'll give it the rest of this year. If it doesn't break out it is gone.
"Have any of you looked at the Insiders trades for the past year, Chairman/CEO Tom Ryan had divested himself of $1.3 Billion (29 Million Shares in the past year). Most of the top execs exercised options and divested them immediately. Currently they are shutdown except for emergency burials, most employees earn less than $15 and hour......."
SCI is up 6.11% to 39.43
"Hmmm...don't get it. Stock was up before earnings call, which was actually pretty good. The dividend payout ratio is low, and the dividend keeps going up. It isn't a growth stock, but its solid. And its definitely not a tech stock. So is that the reason for the fade?"
"Great 4Q, earnings at$1.13 from last quarter of $.88 or 28% increase. An easy $58-60 on horizon."

Solid points Craig. SCI is a responsible and well managed company.

Their business can only improve....Market down 900 SCI up 1.08 on great volume. Unfortunately the rates of deaths and funerals/cremations will only increase. Their business is virus proof and their stock can only appreciate.
Lets see how many short bodies Raymond James leaves on the path to $47. Up nice this morning pre-market
