Time for the bankers to cash out and run. That's all this is. Pass on the debt to someone else.
Is there a reason this stock keeps going down? What is happening?
Heard the Executive Vice President of HR was sacked today. Why no announcement? Notice he is missing from the Leadership section on the Avantor website? Does anyone know what happened? https://www.avantorsciences.com/pages/en/leadership
The accumulation/distribution over the last five days is positive by 295k shares. There is no positive correlation between temporary market inefficiencies and poor companies versus great companies. They both have market makers that feed on the insecurities of market participants. This was the largest health care IPO in history. If you research their customer list and their products you will understand the value before you. Recognizing inefficiencies is the name of the equities market game.

"The problem is Avantor does not make a profit and the historical data is not there. According to Analysts - Avantor, Inc. [AVTR] stock is presenting a less attractive investment opportunity when compared to similarly-sized corporations in the same industry. The price performance of these shares has not shown much promise, and the financial results that this company has recently delivered present a highly risky investment.https://dwinnex.com/2019/09/13/avantor-inc-avtr-price-analysis-next-bullish-target-is-21-32/"

"Avantor, Inc. (NYSE:AVTR) could be among the worst stocks to invest in right now as the company shares are trading 3.55% or 0.54 points down from last closing price of $15.22, reaching $14.68 at last check. Any clue why there is so much of action in the AVTR stock? The share price has dropped in 5 of the last 5 days and is down -18.26% over the past week. It will be exciting to see whether the stock manages to continue decreasing or take a minor break for the next few days. The move came on weak volume too with far less shares changing hands than in a normal session. Trading activity as of this writing weakened by -248,859 shares, and in total 1.98 million shares valued at $29.06 million were seen changing hands compared with 2.228 million shares valued at $33.916 million recorded at the previous session."

"This is from thestreet article posted on yahoo finance for AVTR: Bottom-line strategy: AVTR made a base around $18 so a double to $36 is very much within reason. However, the steady rise since March suggests a period of sideways consolidation is needed. Look for a $25-$29 trading range for a few weeks before the uptrend resumes. Traders could use available weakness to begin building a long position. Our potential price targets are $36 and $44. Risk to $22 for now."
