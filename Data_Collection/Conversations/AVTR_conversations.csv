Why
"I'm new here and my goal for this stock is 50 shares (I only own 8.) so, needless to say, I'm glad the sp is down. Too bad I just transferred money today and cannot buy till tomorrow. I believe it will be worth it in the end."
"I like this company! a Fortune 500 company, leading global provider of mission-critical products and services to very diverse customers (biopharma, healthcare, education & government, and advanced technologies & applied materials industries). 225k+ customer locations, 180+ countries. Just too many insiders selling right … grrrr  … on the sideline, watching "
Give me a break.. this reaction is overblown
An ouch day today
"This stock breaking out..high quality company, next stop is 38-40"
"This has plenty of upside, exposure in multiple sectors. Glad they did an offering to clear some of the debt. Analysts will start increasing their price targets.. rated as a buy for 13 out of 13 analysts."
Ear￼nings call Friday should provide additional info on revenue miss.
