"New York to Pakistan to Main Street, USA. Classic third party shills paid in an effort to manipulate markets. There is no other reason to talk bad about a newly listed company unless you are attempting to help a short position. And yes ""Money"", there is plenty of profit history if you had the IQ to look for it. Market manipulation... naive investors think it is a myth, but check out today's news... The U.S. Department of Justice charged two current traders and one former metals trader for their alleged participation in a racketeering conspiracy over eight years. Gregg Smith and Michael Nowak -- both at JPMorgan JPM, -0.88% -- and Christopher Jordan, who left in 2009 and worked at other banks after -- were charged. The indictment alleges that between May 2008 and August 2016, the defendants engaged in widespread spoofing, market manipulation and fraud for gold, silver, platinum and palladium futures contracts while working on the precious metals desk"

"TMO is down over 20-points in the last month, but who's counting? Certainly there is some entertainment value to be found in watching the herculean-level crack-smoking money-grabbing tape-painting accumulation/distribution-ignoring daily range-setting flag-filling downward-trending spectacle that is the opening of this stock each day. How can you even think about investing in another stock? Shame!"

"Avantor, Inc. (NYSE:AVTR) could be among the worst stocks to invest in right now as the company shares are trading 3.55% or 0.54 points down from last closing price of $15.22, reaching $14.68 at last check. Any clue why there is so much of action in the AVTR stock? The share price has dropped in 5 of the last 5 days and is down -18.26% over the past week. It will be exciting to see whether the stock manages to continue decreasing or take a minor break for the next few days. The move came on weak volume too with far less shares changing hands than in a normal session. Trading activity as of this writing weakened by -248,859 shares, and in total 1.98 million shares valued at $29.06 million were seen changing hands compared with 2.228 million shares valued at $33.916 million recorded at the previous session."

garbage co
crushed earnings.
You would think AVTR $13.85 would be higher since they claim to be a medical supplier.
This stock will never get to $21. The price is sinking each day and don't blame the stock market. Competitors like TMO are not sinking this fast.

The accumulation/distribution over the last five days is positive by 295k shares. There is no positive correlation between temporary market inefficiencies and poor companies versus great companies. They both have market makers that feed on the insecurities of market participants. This was the largest health care IPO in history. If you research their customer list and their products you will understand the value before you. Recognizing inefficiencies is the name of the equities market game.
"Avantor will be below expectations or flat for 2020. keep in mind AVTR's ~10% of revenue coming from the education end market (universities, elementary, and secondary schools) as it seems more likely that school closures could last into the autumn, while university labs may not be fully operational until the end of the year. The ~7% of revenue coming from medical devices due to delayed procedures. Given Avantor’s high debt levels, gross debt will rise as the company preserves cash and draws on its receivables facility and possibly its revolver. AVTR does not have cash to invest like TMO."

"This is from thestreet article posted on yahoo finance for AVTR: Bottom-line strategy: AVTR made a base around $18 so a double to $36 is very much within reason. However, the steady rise since March suggests a period of sideways consolidation is needed. Look for a $25-$29 trading range for a few weeks before the uptrend resumes. Traders could use available weakness to begin building a long position. Our potential price targets are $36 and $44. Risk to $22 for now."
