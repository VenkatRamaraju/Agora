"I've owned this since 9 dollars. pretty boring stock, but part of a dividend portfolio. Not a company that will make you rich, but if you hold the div will pay for the stock eventually. IMO"
"Stock is flat because of no growth during a year of people buying processed/packaged foods, low material costs and eating at home."

"I am mainly in tech and well known brands like GOOG, AAPL, AMZN. Why did I buy AMCR, a stock that generally no one knows about? I just know that packages of all sizes keep getting delivered to us and every household in the US and around the world and it might not be a household name but its products and the sector is booming with ecommerce up significantly. I am holding. God bless and stay well."

1.5 yrs after Acquiring Beamis and AMCR is down 5% from post acquisition share price and the S&P 500 is up 35%! Where are the synergies? Just another example of poor execution and a Board that is asleep at the wheel!
Bought at 11.69 for div.
Looks like a good 2nd Quarter CC. Not sure why the stock price is flat. I brought some more. Having the div can't hurt. GLTA.
is this squeezing?
Is the AMCR dividend subject to the 15% European withholding tax?
"With an almost 5% dividend yield, is this an attractive buy? Bemis was historically well managed financially and had a long history of consistently increasing their dividend. I don't know Amcor's history though, have they been as prudently managed financially?"
bought 100 more shares this morning
position started for dividend
Is the dividend subject to Swiss 35% tax withholding ?
big time insider selling. stay away

"Unlike other packaging names like WRK have slashed their dividends over COVID. AMCR has not done so, and it is the leader in the packaging industry. In addition, it's ROA and ROC are superior compared to the industry averages. I am fully convinced the packaging industry has more room to run from here, and that AMCR has a lot to offer me both in the way of returns and a solid income stream."
"Bought more before earnings manana....Great chart.Unknown, unfollowed name breaking out.Anyone here?"
"should dividend stocks be in tax deferred Roth IRA or my individual taxed account??? New to investing. Also , do you re invest the dividends or deposit to core account?"
