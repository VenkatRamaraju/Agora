Holding gains intraday superb 
"Added 11 shares on today’s dip. It’s not much, but I’m at 190 shares now "
I sold all my Chinese stocks last year in order to purchase Palantir. Pretty happy with that decision. I think Im done investing in China.
The next market correction should offer a nice buying opportunity

They can run it up and pull it back down. Just close green for me again and keep the momentum going upwards. If we close this week on a new high from last week I'm a happy man...

"Are we going to close above $25, on a Friday?"

If I wasn’t all in on Tesla I’d def buy some pltr. Probably gonna buy some leaps tho!
"I bought this stock at $38.50 and holding long.. I believe in the company's business line. In addition, it invests in companies with bright future.. The following is an article that was written o that. Very smart....Buying revenueIt was revealed in Palantir's recent 10-Q that it has made an overall $250 million investment in 10 different companies. But what stood out to me is that some of these companies will be spending close to double the amount Palantir has invested in them on Palantir's Foundry platform. I'll list three of them. Sarcos Robotics: Palantir invested $21 million and Sarcos committed to utilize software and services from Palantir over the next six years for a total of $42 million.Roivant Sciences: Palantir invested $30 million and Roivant Sciences will pay $39 million over a five-year period.Celularity: Palantir invested $20 million and Celularity will pay $40 million over five years for access to Palantir's Foundry platform.Not only is Palantir investing in what could be potential future mega-cap companies but it is also exposing its software to data that usually wouldn't be used by small start-ups."
