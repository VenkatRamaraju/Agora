"The U.S. military confirmed that it carried out a drone strike on Sunday, successfully taking out what appeared to be an explosives-packed vehicle heading toward Kabul's international airport....Thank you Gotham ! I am proud to be a shareholder of Palantir"
Is this a meme stock?

"Blackrock sold 70% of their Palantir shares back in May, and it looks like they bought back all of it in August! Does anyone has information on this ownership?"
Headed to the 30s
I sold all my Chinese stocks last year in order to purchase Palantir. Pretty happy with that decision. I think Im done investing in China.
I love when people react negatively on GREEN days. Just means they missed their target buy in and want the price to drop
Why buy at $45......when u can buy at $26?
"Den of Thieves Palantir movie reference. Was watching Den of Thieves and main actor Gerard Butler plays a detective. At a crime scene he says to a colleague “Do a Palantir run” as he leaves the crime scene. Hahahaha.My ears perked up! Movie was filmed back in 2018. No effect on share price, just thought it was cool "
"Major resistance at 26.18, HOLD THE LINE!"
"As a long term investor of PLTR since IPO.. I feel obligated to share this Gem I found. PLCKF - cybersecurity company. $40M market cap, Q2 rev was $8M. 15 new contracts last 3 months. Great small cap growth company."
PLTR poised for the inevitable run to $100 plus?
"I said Buy, Hold, Relax, NOT Buy, Panic, Sell. Thanks for the dip."
And here come the ambulance chasers for the FBI glitch! Scooping up more shares lol
In my personal opinion this will seesaw all the way until the EOY and insiders have finished dumping all the shares they can dump. We will see a significant rise next year. Try and time the market right and load up when you can. If you're looking for it to rise significantly in the short term you will be disappointed...
$30 today for sure no doubt
Who here holding since DPO day like me ?
I sold my 200 shares at an average basis of $23.10.. My conscience told me to do so..
I think Karp will do the main strike tomorrow. Tons of shares sold.
Holding gains intraday superb 
PLTR is clearly heading from the long term chart. Possible target new ATH?
"Heading to the golf course, good luck to all the longs"
Buy on dip. Cathie wood just explained why she is scooping up more shares around $24-25. Before end of year it will goes to $36.
Better buy right now in AH before news hits publicly tomorrow!
"To everyone saying “buy”, you should have already bought before now. At some point, you’re paying too much and exposing yourself to risk. I bought a little under 4500 shares but I did it a long time ago and stopped buying (avg of $20). Keep this in mind as you expose yourself to risks and an unpredictable market. I’m long PLTR and will never sell but don’t spend money you’re not afraid to see disappear. You have to possess the conviction to see your stock drop significantly and not sell. Good luck, all! "

Since bottoming at around $16 or so months ago..........PLTR has risen over $10 bucks a share.
The CEO is in the game. It's already falling.
"I bought this stock at $38.50 and holding long.. I believe in the company's business line. In addition, it invests in companies with bright future.. The following is an article that was written o that. Very smart....Buying revenueIt was revealed in Palantir's recent 10-Q that it has made an overall $250 million investment in 10 different companies. But what stood out to me is that some of these companies will be spending close to double the amount Palantir has invested in them on Palantir's Foundry platform. I'll list three of them. Sarcos Robotics: Palantir invested $21 million and Sarcos committed to utilize software and services from Palantir over the next six years for a total of $42 million.Roivant Sciences: Palantir invested $30 million and Roivant Sciences will pay $39 million over a five-year period.Celularity: Palantir invested $20 million and Celularity will pay $40 million over five years for access to Palantir's Foundry platform.Not only is Palantir investing in what could be potential future mega-cap companies but it is also exposing its software to data that usually wouldn't be used by small start-ups."
"It seems like there is a lot of short interest on PLTR. Look at price of 9/3 37C today. Sold blocks of 10 for $0.02 this morning, surprised these calls have any value at all. My guess is shorts are buying these calls to reduce their own tail end risk. Either that or someone is playing scratch-offs with PLTR.As a long, selling deep OTM calls and strategically accumulating a position on the dips has worked well so far. Many short and put holders on this board will complain about insider selling, but the matter of fact is they are swimming against the company revenue growth.GLTAL"
They can run it up and pull it back down. Just close green for me again and keep the momentum going upwards. If we close this week on a new high from last week I'm a happy man...
