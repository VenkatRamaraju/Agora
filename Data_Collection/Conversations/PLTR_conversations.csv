People here dream that the JEDI contract will take the Palantir. Have any of them read anything about JEDI? This company does not meet the requirements at all.

"Sorry folks had to sell PLTR to buy CLSK, a lot safer and less diluted potential there IMHO."
this is the type of company i dreamed about being able to invest in while studying in business school. thankful for the opportunity to be apart of this
Just started a position 1k shares at 24. GL ALL !!
"About 30 days till Q3. Will confirm ave rev growth 45%. Q4 guidance $500B, maybe. 2022 = $2B. Cash approaching $3B. And we learn a lot more about the long and growing list of investments. Good luck to those shorting PLTR."

One of ARK’s TOP 10 Investments!!!Go PLTR!
FED CONTRACT also in the pipemore than 1B !
Support Karp to make him even richer. Buy more.
Can we get a 1:10 reverse split to get this out of the meme corner? Thanks!
With level 6 clearance Palantir will soon be the silent “P” on PFANG…
Let me get this straight.For a long time now there was endless discussion and speculation about large government contracts being secured.The event Finally happens and then even before the depth or impact of these contracts can be known…. people are considering exiting ?Mutual Funds are now setting themselves up in to positions for the coming couple of quarters.So if you want to help them out then go ahead and sell to them.They will sell those shares back to you later at a much higher price because THATS WHAT THEY DO.
$300+ in 3 years
if you bought at $10 and didnt average up you up 130% !If bought at $18 now you up 25%If you bought at $30 you down 25%..
"Jedi contract next utilize AWS and or Microsoft cloud service's Army win $820M, 10/5Vet $90M, 9/30Department of Energy $90M, 9/29NIH $60M, 9/28IRS $12M, 9/27US immigration $43M, 9/17Airforce $48M, 8/30"

so much for big rally 
Army Selects Palantir for Intelligence Data Fabric and Analytics Solution
China will have a MAJOR say in Palantir and its future.
News today by reuter claimed China had won the AI battle. I disagree!!!! Wait a few more several months and GOTHAM will galvanized the lead against the giant they claimed to be.
"There's a company called Rigetti & Co., Inc. whose business is to build the most powerful computers. They are pioneer in full-stack quantum computing....it could be a great partner for PLTR in the very near future...my opinion."
the selling is finally over. monthly low out In today. 2 weeks close to $29 again
Karp lied to us - he said Palantir would grow at 25% per year - in reality it’s 25% per quarter this year
Market turning red and we green what a stock
over 25 tomorrow- SHORTS WILL COVER...
Almost everyday someone joins Palantir Foundry Builders. Today was a company called mePrism.
Up a penny. Dominic is celebrating for sure

Are we rich yet? I have been asking since last Feb
"PLTR Is one of 4 finalists, down from 11. For the FDIC contract. Can’t wait until this is announced."
It feels like we gonna get stuck here until next earning. Why such amount of hate on this stock.

"Would someone out there answer a question? Does the daily volume of shares represent both sales and purchases combined for that day? I'm a novice player, and was just wondering. At todays price that seems to total 921 m, give or take a couple. That's but lunch. Thanks for your help."

"lowered my position down to 1,000 shares. this dog isn't going to hunt for awhile"
"Don't get me wrong, I love this company...but to give out it's entire bull run in 6 days? C'mon man.."
They keep coming yet shares stay in the sideways trade. There will be 1 that finally does it. Shares will start to climb and they'll keep going. It's inevitable. 1 press release will put an end to the selling. 1 press release will sway the market to get out of the way and price will rise dramatically.
All the so called analysts that write negative news wanting PLTR to drop are all manipulating the price so they can get in at a lower price. That's what they try and do and happens all the time.
Delicious. Not unexpected after yesterday’s runup in the markets and Palantir’s massive 15 cent gain.
"Just imagine if the market start going down, there will blood everywhere with PLTR. Sell, bring it down, so we can all get back in again at $20."
"If anything, the graph shows this is taking a dive today."
SHORT Position UP 18% to 72m from 61m 15 days ago.. Institutions Ownership stalled at 23.9% unchanged..Buy it for Long term. Good luck
LOL.
Another great contract. Down a dollar today I bet!!!
"Palantir (PLTR) was selected to progress to the next phase of the Army’s competitive $823m indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. After collaborating with the Army on a successful “Test, Fix, Test” process, Palantir(PLTR) will support the Army as they proceed through final testing and fielding."
$50 call options for January 2023 is the best play here. They are only $1.25 right now!!

When will this explode. I’m buying VRUS stock also today
"Though I am tempted, I am NOT going to sell and take my profit and run...the minute I did it would break over $40..."
"We all say it, we all know it................PLTR continues to make ""more and more cash"" going forward!"

If the ascent continues then you know those big fund large buy orders have been completed
Added to my position today bringing my total share count to 684.
"So if the SEC votes to force disclosure of short positions by Hedge funds and MMs in November, does this mean I will have a well formatted concise report of who’s been leveraging billions against my position in Palantir??? Get the bath water ready and line up the space shuttles…"
PLTR CEO Karp who doesn't show up for Earnings Calls and DUMPS his company shares weekly in millions. What company CEO does that? Name one company. Can you think of any company that does that except for the companies that went out of business. ha ha ha to the mooooon with Karp the Dumpster
Honestly 837M contract and the market cap rose 6B yesterday AH. I expected this. However… I do in fact think that this drop has been because of manipulation. Look at the volume and the beautiful downward staircase in the chart today! I think it’s manipulation. It was $29 a few days ago without any news of a contract whatsoever. An almost 1 Billion dollar contract and the stock does this…
Larry Fink's Blackrock now owns more than 41M shares while Cathie of Ark owns more than 30M shares now.

"In U.S. Federal government contracting, IDIQ is an abbreviation of the term indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity. This is a type of contract that provides for an indefinite quantity of supplies or services during a fixed period of time. The legal origin of IDIQ contracts is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.504(a) (48 CFR 16.504). IDIQs are also sometimes called ""Task Orders"" or ""Delivery Order Contracts."" IDIQ contracts are a subtype of Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC), which is a ""vehicle that has been awarded to one or more vendors to facilitate the delivery of supply and service orders.""[1]It’s believed these are typically no more than 5 year contracts. So is a worst case scenario Palantir just inked 11.7% of all of 2021 sales revenue in one single order. Chew on that thought for a moment. This is massive news to the books! Longs stay strong through the turbulence, we’re starting to move. One love !"
"Let’s me get this straight.Snow - $98.65BPltr - $47.12BDon’t get me started on the balance sheets of both and the future revenue potential of both. They’re heavily skewed in Palantir favor and yet we’re 1/2 the market cap…No, no manipulation happening here…"
I sold it at a loss. I was incredibly relieved. This stock has teased us for months. Now I don't care even if it is 100 usd. I wish good luck to those who have it.
Gains gone by tomorrow morning. Zero chance this maintains these levels. Sell!

"Here's a theory for some of you. This was the news that ran us to $29.20. Then WS did what they do best and they stole shares from you paper handed traders who have no vision, patience or belief in the stock you bought....And now they get to run it up again but with a huge potential contract in hand...STOP looking at share price and START looking at the opportunity ahead."
the contracts this company is getting are crazy impressive. you don’t get contracts like that without doing something very right.

Hi my name is Rafael. I own 600 shares of PLTR.
Kinda painful watching the shares of other tech companies balloon while this struggles to inflate.
this stock never keeps the momentum

PLTR shareholders just don't truly understand that China influence over the USA and the world. Yet we are focused on Rolling Stones Brown Sugar ban.

"Just to be clear. Palantir is awarded a $825M contract, and the stock price is at risk of going down on the news? In what universe does this make sense?"
This company got Bull trap written all over it. I'm not expecting any gains till at least spring of 22.
Gooood morning fellow Palantir Kong’s. Ahh. Sorry. Just stretching. Making coffee. Headed to work to make my employer money just like the 100 Palantir reps out there making me money. Slept well last night. Have a super groovy day!
One day in the future............$500 plus per share!
"Longs have a great weekend. New contracts coming in and we have great leadership. If anyone complains about the company just tell them, no one forced you to buy the company and move along these are not the droid's you're looking for "
There is a lot of new business related with government sectors every quarter. Why is the commercial sector not viewing PLTR in the same fashion ?
Hard to make much profit per share with a 2 billion share count. This is becoming clearer every day.
Back to where it peaked a week ago. Onward to 25.
About that time of the day Palantir gives up every cent of their daily gains
inching down as usual ffs
CEO Karp sold over 18.8M shares.. for the past yearand insider sold over 12M shares..almost 31M share sold by insider..
"Other than organic growth, there are so much exponential potential growth among its invested/partnering in companies, not to mention among it also are some other or many autonomous land & air based companies other than Wejo."
I will hold for the next 4-7 years. This will be well over 5 times it’s current share price. Consistently signing big contracts near 1 billion dollars. Just patience & averaging.
Can’t wait to buy this at$15 in November
"It is clear analyst know absolutely nothing about government contracts. There are two types of contractors, one is the prime or the one that is awarded the contract and the other is the sub contractor that works for and gets paid by the prime contractor. In this Army contract, it is clear that Palantir is the prime contractor. Now, as prime, Palantir makes a margin on all the work they do, all the work their subcontractors do and the cost of all the materials used. They have to list out the percentage of all those cost and the amount on the bid form. Then there is a line item to list their profit and over head which can range from15 to 35 percent. The trick is to keep this percentage low and to build in some of it into the subcontractor and supply amount. There are other items to consider like prevailing wages, bid bond cost, performance bonds, insurance cost, retainers and many others as the government's concern is that the work gets done with no effort on their side. They do not want to take on the role of the prime contractor. Palantir was awarded the contract so they are the prime contractor. They will get a cut of every thing that is done within that contract, not just what they do. So 800+ million is a big deal!"
"Employees 100% satisfied with leadership, mission and vision."

omg again down Unbelievable
What’s the run up . Guess inflation good for pltr lol
Who wants this to stay down so bad so accumulation can continue?
"Im not a basher but a realist, PLTr is red in a sea of green. I hold my buy point of $19-20"
I heard something special. Can’t repeat it yet. It’s good thing
"As soon as the price goes up, people try to get out of this trap and the price goes down."
I don’t invest on charts but the 6 month chart looks healthy to me..
Wow that’s a huge contract
It's clearly preparing to breakout of the $20s. It retest $29 three times this year. When it break through $30s we might just go to trending up for awhile.
I think a lot of people look at PLTR (or stocks in general) from a short-term perspective. I think everyone will laugh in 5 years that PLTR was in the 20s for so long. This is an amazing company and I’m very bullish on it
"The replacement of ICE contract is not expected any time...ICE issued on Oct 8th a request for a white paper (Solicitation Number : ICEHSIICM-1082021) for the purpose of evaluating ""investigation Case Management"" in the market. Per the request ""THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued IAW FAR 15.201(c)(7) and is solely for market research, planning and information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a subsequent solicitation (Request for Proposal, etc.). Based on this, there is no intention for ICE to replace Palantir at this time. If we assume the worst, this white paper is due on Nov 29th, then if someone else has the capabilities, then, they might issue a request for a proposal sometimes next year. If any replacement to happen, that will be in 2025. Keep in mind, the initial ICM was deployed in 2016, and it took 5 years to enhance and meet all their requirements. One last note, the ICM is a cloud based system, and ICE requires the system to meet Fedramp requirements, normally there are one or two vendors in the market that can meet such a requirements, Palantir is already fedramp today."
Am I the only one seeing too much green signal ?
Really.... Just got a new contract...
I can't believe this is only up $1
Let’s be real. $823m isn’t penny change by 99.9% of existing multi-national corporations’ standards. There’s a lot more to come… 
after November 11th it will be the 5th consecutive positive earnings. the talk will be up when this will be entered into the s&p 500. will it happen in the first quarter of 2022?
cheers to the true longs

"2 Funny Points.....1.) The CC is in November. Let's see if Karp shows up for this one. He has skipped the last 2. It's amazing that the CEO Karp doesn't show up for the CC. I mean, the first year as a public company and CEO Karp can't/won't show up for PLTR shareholders. The CC is for the shareholders, and Karp can't/won't find it within himself to even consider showing up. But Karp sure does make sure he can get his options super cheap and exercise them.2.) Note the IO is only in the mid 20's and not the mid 70's. If PLTR is suppose to be such a super company why is Wallstreet not all that impressed. Could it be that WS looks at PLTR with 2.4 billion in cash, and 1.5 billion in revs, and PLTR still can't churn a GAAP-profit. Maybe it's because PLTR has too many oink-pigs at the SBC trough. Trust me, WS notices."
"There is dark pool shorting going on with PLTR...It's pretty obvious some forces are keeping the price down...Can't see the order flow, roughly 35% shorted in the dark. Strong and Long PLTR"

"I believe Palantir is going to be one of those stocks that moves up exponentially over time. Yes, there is going to be a long stretch of sideways movement, but eventually it reaches that point where their investments start to compound and it will explode higher. Look at Microsoft's stock price over the past 20 years. That is how Palantir will move over the years."

"it is curious that the brokerage that handles the sale of karp's converted options did not do so this time. they were exercised but not sold. generally it is handled quickly and unless the volume is very light it is done on the same day. to date Karp's sales have come at regular intervals but not this time. it is also odd that the form S3-ASR was filed 10/1 the same day as the conversion but no sale. wonder whythe abbreviation MNPI stands for material non public information.Under Rule 10b5-1, directors and other major insiders in the company—large shareholders, officers, and others who have access to MNPI—can establish a written plan that details when they can buy or sell shares at a predetermined time on a scheduled basis. It is set up this way so that they are able to make these transactions when they are not in the vicinity of MNPI. This also allows companies to utilize 10b5-1 plans in large stock buybacks."

"I do not believe that the pps is going to go as low as the $22.35 per share that it closed at on August 11th, the day before the August 12th release of 2nd QTR earnings. (Hopefully it will stay in the 23's until Monday, when I will have funds available to double my position)The fact that it is now selling at less than what it closed at ($24.89) on August 12th (the day 2nd QTR earnings were released) is a GIFTI believe that they (officers?, board members? Insiders?, large funds?) determine by the last week of a quarter that the results are fantastic (beat the street consensus) and then manipulate (I don’t know how this is done but I imagine it is done with big blocks between a buyer and seller acting in concert) the share price down between the end of a quarter and the release of that quarter’s revenue, eps, free cash flow, number of new government and commercial customers, guidance for the current quarter and year-end, etc.HISTORY:9.34 a year ago, October 14th$39.00 on January 27th$38.17 on February 9th$23.29 on March 31st, end of the 1st Qtr.

(1st Qtr. earnings were announced pre-market)Then continual uptrend to $27.38 on June 28th, days before the end of the 2nd QtrSo…the board and insiders know that 2nd QTR results were very good, but what does the stock do between then and the August 12th earnings announcement? It declines…to $22.35 on August 11th.On August 12th (release of 2nd Qtr earnings), it closes at $24.89 and trends up during the remainder of the 3rd Qtr to a close of $28.56 on September 24th, 6 days before the end of the 3rd QTR…again the financial results are pretty much known (to the officers and board) at that point, 6 days before the end of the quarter.I think the 3rd QTR results are going to be very good…but similar to the end of the first and second quarters, what does the stock do in the ensuing period between end of the quarter and release of that quarter’s earnings? It goes DOWN.$28.56 on September 24thLow 23’s this week"
Y’all need patience. Waited YEARS for Tesla.
If you watch the trades through the day it is obvious that this stock is being manipulated.When they have filled all their large buy orders at these low prices it will take off again
"Keep this stock price right here for me...Some people have lost sight of what this is, a growth company/stock who spent a ton to get a huge head start and is now going to have parabolic growth ahead of them...In the last 30 days they've announced more contract revenue then they had in all of 2020...Think on that"
"I'm trying to fathom why it has dropped so severely.I believe as TechSeller states that the product (their software) is best-in-class, but what will the demand be given the following changes/dynamics:Inflation is more severe than they forecast and not going to subside as quickly as they thought, maybe not at all... the supply chain disruptions, workers not coming back to work (even after the Covid assistance ended)...ships stacked up in the harbor, not enough truck drivers to transport the goods, fear of upcoming 3rd Qt earnings reports given the ongoing supply chain issues over the last quarter and presently, fear of Evergrande contamination, etc.All adds up to a shaky market right now. My guess is that the 13-F forms that institutional investment managers (managing a 100 million or more in securities) must file by November 15th ... are going to show a net decrease in the number of Palantir shares held by institutions as of September 30th/end of 3rd QTR.I am long...and regrettably I significantly added (5X) to my position last week...above $25 in pre-market the day after they released the news about the Army contract...:-(But, I am holding. You don't lose until you sell."

Palantir is a good company it’s the current administration that is hurting the economy and the markets￼. Never ever vote Democrat￼.
"Ya know, PLTR is like gambling, the last thing you want to do is win big the first time you gamble because then you when return to gamble you will think it will be like the first time, winning easily...but you rarely ever do again...so when PLTR ran up to $45 two months after it listed is like winning at your first time gambling...but so far, the inevitable losing is taking place while we wait, daily, for the chimerical $45 level to reappear..."
