Depressing... This is depressing!
PLTR has the same chart pattern with Tesla ! Be patient!
I bought some yesterday and SINKS like a rock on a GREEN day.The whole market is partying but PLTR. Seems like always left out of the party.It is like the kid that no one wants to play with.
Y’all need patience. Waited YEARS for Tesla.
"There is dark pool shorting going on with PLTR...It's pretty obvious some forces are keeping the price down...Can't see the order flow, roughly 35% shorted in the dark. Strong and Long PLTR"
"2 times so far I had the chance to break even at $28, and I held! Third time I’d the charm when I dump at 28"
Gains gone by tomorrow morning. Zero chance this maintains these levels. Sell!
$28 tomm
With level 6 clearance Palantir will soon be the silent “P” on PFANG…
"I’m looking forward to an opening gap higher of $30 Monday. I’d there’s one thing I’ve learned, short sellers mess with the price before great news releases."
Should have brought Tesla this is just another s/w company with L6 clearance done a dozen
I believe PLTR will be part of S&P500 next year.
I’m out…..
"Can anybody fix this CEOWhat Happened: A Form 4 filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states that Alexander Karp exercised options to purchase 1,915,887 Palantir Technologies shares for $0 on October 14. They then sold their shares on multiple transactions in the open market. They sold at prices ranging from $23.56 to $24.46 to raise a total of $46,031,931 from the stock sale."
Back to where it peaked a week ago. Onward to 25.
"I have 1,400 shares and holding long $PLTR"
Giddy up!
"4,500,000 shares (a tenth of the daily average number of shares traded) in 13 minutes!:-)But I was hoping it would stay depressed until my escrow closes....:-("
Just started a position 1k shares at 24. GL ALL !!

Let me get this straight.For a long time now there was endless discussion and speculation about large government contracts being secured.The event Finally happens and then even before the depth or impact of these contracts can be known…. people are considering exiting ?Mutual Funds are now setting themselves up in to positions for the coming couple of quarters.So if you want to help them out then go ahead and sell to them.They will sell those shares back to you later at a much higher price because THATS WHAT THEY DO.
"I came to the conclusion the more time you spend on these boards the harder it is to be long on a stock. Before I started looking at these comments I would not even think about a stock on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. I only look at the price when I had saved up enough to buy a decent amount because it used to cost money to make a trade."
when we going back to 45?
"How about a 10% rise today alone, huh!"
"and SNOW company is like ""hot"""
Hard to make much profit per share with a 2 billion share count. This is becoming clearer every day.
Very nice!!
"PLTR Is one of 4 finalists, down from 11. For the FDIC contract. Can’t wait until this is announced."
"Ya know, PLTR is like gambling, the last thing you want to do is win big the first time you gamble because then you when return to gamble you will think it will be like the first time, winning easily...but you rarely ever do again...so when PLTR ran up to $45 two months after it listed is like winning at your first time gambling...but so far, the inevitable losing is taking place while we wait, daily, for the chimerical $45 level to reappear..."
"It is clear analyst know absolutely nothing about government contracts. There are two types of contractors, one is the prime or the one that is awarded the contract and the other is the sub contractor that works for and gets paid by the prime contractor. In this Army contract, it is clear that Palantir is the prime contractor. Now, as prime, Palantir makes a margin on all the work they do, all the work their subcontractors do and the cost of all the materials used. They have to list out the percentage of all those cost and the amount on the bid form. Then there is a line item to list their profit and over head which can range from15 to 35 percent. The trick is to keep this percentage low and to build in some of it into the subcontractor and supply amount. There are other items to consider like prevailing wages, bid bond cost, performance bonds, insurance cost, retainers and many others as the government's concern is that the work gets done with no effort on their side. They do not want to take on the role of the prime contractor. Palantir was awarded the contract so they are the prime contractor. They will get a cut of every thing that is done within that contract, not just what they do. So 800+ million is a big deal!"
I will hold for the next 4-7 years. This will be well over 5 times it’s current share price. Consistently signing big contracts near 1 billion dollars. Just patience & averaging.
"Everyone look at the 6mon chart, looks like a very long term growth ahead is coming!"
not again

This is the OG meme stock.
Karp buyin shares!!!
what is going on? This should be up on a big green day!!!Anyone has any real news?
People here dream that the JEDI contract will take the Palantir. Have any of them read anything about JEDI? This company does not meet the requirements at all.
The three day chart pattern is bullish. I see this between $28-30 short- term. And why not? It’s a great company.
the selling is finally over. monthly low out In today. 2 weeks close to $29 again
Selling the weekly calls seems too easy for how much it pays.
"To those who do not understand what Foundry is, think of Microsoft Windows over DOS when all these billion founders thought of how it can become a productivity suite PC for all. Well, Foundry is about to do over all OS in the planet. I think KARP_THEIL's decision to go public was insync with the birth of 5G Technology. So, here we the future star------Foundry OS by Palantir."
I have been here to tell the truth and wasted time for last 11 months...and lost money...this company stock is stuck in $22-24 range. Drops as soon as hits $27...CEO Karp dumping does not help either
this will drop under 15 if dow hits 50000
PLTR share price 5 years from today? $180 plus.......
the contracts this company is getting are crazy impressive. you don’t get contracts like that without doing something very right.
"I have 1384 shares of Palantir, I'm keeping them till 2025. I also but 1 share a day. On dips like the one, we had last week I buy hundreds of dollars worth. I'm bullish on Palantir and will keep buying."
They keep coming yet shares stay in the sideways trade. There will be 1 that finally does it. Shares will start to climb and they'll keep going. It's inevitable. 1 press release will put an end to the selling. 1 press release will sway the market to get out of the way and price will rise dramatically.
"remember this, the 'shelf offering'. when the details are released the stock is going to get punished. notice anything about the timing of the release of the army contract and the release of the shelf. on top of eachother. this is the way pltr does things, they give you something good to offset bad thing that they have done or have made plain they plan on doing. prepare for pain."
The markets are greener than green. Don’t let some manipulation on a low volume day shake you. I’d buy more if I could today.
Once again the MM takes the money from those who bet on call options. When will they learn.

"A cyber attack on a central hospital in Israel against a demand for payment. outcome: Hospital is completely closed, Transferring patients to another hospital, But no personal data at all !!!

"it is curious that the brokerage that handles the sale of karp's converted options did not do so this time. they were exercised but not sold. generally it is handled quickly and unless the volume is very light it is done on the same day. to date Karp's sales have come at regular intervals but not this time. it is also odd that the form S3-ASR was filed 10/1 the same day as the conversion but no sale. wonder whythe abbreviation MNPI stands for material non public information.Under Rule 10b5-1, directors and other major insiders in the company—large shareholders, officers, and others who have access to MNPI—can establish a written plan that details when they can buy or sell shares at a predetermined time on a scheduled basis. It is set up this way so that they are able to make these transactions when they are not in the vicinity of MNPI. This also allows companies to utilize 10b5-1 plans in large stock buybacks."

"About 30 days till Q3. Will confirm ave rev growth 45%. Q4 guidance $500B, maybe. 2022 = $2B. Cash approaching $3B. And we learn a lot more about the long and growing list of investments. Good luck to those shorting PLTR."
"Can someone explain why PLTR is going south? Any bad news coming after hours? Big Boys manipulating the price?I am not able to find anything to justify the low price?I understand that the volume is about 16 million, which is below the 46 million average volume...However, it seems that 16 million shares, owned mostly by retailers, are being sold so far today...Why the low price?"
Closed green for 2 red market days. I smell bottom.

"Other incredible investment/partner by Palantir in SPAC list companies: ADTheorent, Fast Radius, Wejo, Origin Materials,Box, Pear Therapeutics, Tritium, Blacksky, Kredivo."
Closing over 26 would be fantastic.
What is the strike price they are trying to get down to today?
over 25 tomorrow- SHORTS WILL COVER...
when this is a $100 stock in the next few years it will not matter if you bought at $23 or $25. accumulate and hold
Hey everyone let's see all the thumbs-up for the 823m $ contract
I doubt big players will let this cross above $25 tomorrow.
Use Lube :-)
Are we rich yet??
"The extremely odd new thread being proffered to this board by its participants is that PLTR will achieve a PPS of $60.00 by the end of this year.The reasons being given is that PLTR, together with their new Government and Private contracts will somehow propel the company to these new levels.I first became aware of it when Amature posted something to this effect, it has since been parroted by others.This board of course has no credibility, I wouldn't trust statements like these. A sustained share price above $30.00 by the end of the year would be a gift."

Added 50 shares today. Will wait for a bigger pullback. Perfectly fine with this consolidating under 25
Accumulate and become a multimillionaire! It's that simple...........
I think a lot of people look at PLTR (or stocks in general) from a short-term perspective. I think everyone will laugh in 5 years that PLTR was in the 20s for so long. This is an amazing company and I’m very bullish on it
"i buy, i wait 5 years, i have bags of money. simple"

"kids, red = green light to add. Enjoy the waves. It's just consolidating and amassing long term holders, once there is enough they will take it higher. Can't go higher with all these day wizards in and out. But everyday, more and more longs are buying and holding."
About that time of the day Palantir gives up every cent of their daily gains
Are we rich yet?
"I do not believe that the pps is going to go as low as the $22.35 per share that it closed at on August 11th, the day before the August 12th release of 2nd QTR earnings. (Hopefully it will stay in the 23's until Monday, when I will have funds available to double my position)The fact that it is now selling at less than what it closed at ($24.89) on August 12th (the day 2nd QTR earnings were released) is a GIFTI believe that they (officers?, board members? Insiders?, large funds?) determine by the last week of a quarter that the results are fantastic (beat the street consensus) and then manipulate (I don’t know how this is done but I imagine it is done with big blocks between a buyer and seller acting in concert) the share price down between the end of a quarter and the release of that quarter’s revenue, eps, free cash flow, number of new government and commercial customers, guidance for the current quarter and year-end, etc.HISTORY:9.34 a year ago, October 14th$39.00 on January 27th$38.17 on February 9th$23.29 on March 31st, end of the 1st Qtr. (1st Qtr results were stellar, why did it decline between February 9th and March 31st and then decline further between the March 31st end of the 1st Qtr and the May 11th reporting of those 1st Qtr results?As noted above, more downward price action between the March 31st close at $23.29 and the May 10th close (1 day before 1st Qtr earnings announcement) at $18.47.$20.21 May 11th. (1st Qtr. earnings were announced pre-market)Then continual uptrend to $27.38 on June 28th, days before the end of the 2nd QtrSo…the board and insiders know that 2nd QTR results were very good, but what does the stock do between then and the August 12th earnings announcement? It declines…to $22.35 on August 11th.On August 12th (release of 2nd Qtr earnings), it closes at $24.89 and trends up during the remainder of the 3rd Qtr to a close of $28.56 on September 24th, 6 days before the end of the 3rd QTR…again the financial results are pretty much known (to the officers and board) at that point, 6 days before the end of the quarter.I think the 3rd QTR results are going to be very good…but similar to the end of the first and second quarters, what does the stock do in the ensuing period between end of the quarter and release of that quarter’s earnings? It goes DOWN.$28.56 on September 24thLow 23’s this week"
Free fall on a green day! Dead money for sure.

"Holding 1,000 shares. Been holding for about 6 months. I’ll probably sell a portion of my position tomorrow to bounce into BABA then get those profits and roll them back into PLTR. I want to have 2,000 shares so I’m a long way out. What do ya’ll think?"
created a new position of 520 shares at 23.40. 200 EMA.
It feels like we gonna get stuck here until next earning. Why such amount of hate on this stock.
so much for big rally 
Support Karp to make him even richer. Buy more.
"Look at the 5 day chart. It closed Tuesday at $23.69Look at one of my previous posts...it did something like (I give the exact number in that previous post) 4.5 million shares (10% of average daily volume at that time) in the 1st 13 minutes of trade on Wednesday....so on Wednesday it opened at $24.24, HIT A LOW FOR THE DAY OF 23.93 (which is as low as whoever bought all those shares in the 1st 13 minutes wanted it to go) and closed at $24.13.Again, on the day of that BIG BLOCK BUYING IN THE FIRST 13 MINUTES, it hit a low of $23.93, right where it's at now.I would buy right now, right here....and will do so when my wire hits...escrow sends a wire to WFB, then I have to send a wire from the WFB a/c to TD Ameritrade a/c....had to sign for escrow to send the wire (settlement funds from a property I sold that recorded at 8 a.m. this morning, waiting for escrow to call and confirm wire sent to WFB) to WFB instead of TD Ameritrade because the property was in the name of my trust and TD Ameritrade account in my name...escrow can only wire funds to an account that is in the same name as the property was held.I'M CALLING A BOTTOM HERE....BUT TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE."

"Sorry folks had to sell PLTR to buy CLSK, a lot safer and less diluted potential there IMHO."
Karp sold 1.9 million shares over the last 3 days. Good news - has already happened. Final options are exercised on week 15-19th Nov then nothing until 2032.
I see $50 by the end of the year
one word describes this company.....tragic
"The uptrend has started my friends, the Golden Cross is confirmed. See you at see you at 62.47ish I'll go ahead and set up Basecamp."
I'd only buy this stock if one had a little bit of money and a'lot of time. Solid company but it's going to be a while
Best short stock on the market. So delicious.
ha ha ha where is your $35 to the moooooonnnnnnn! LOL
China will have a MAJOR say in Palantir and its future.
"Let’s me get this straight.Snow - $98.65BPltr - $47.12BDon’t get me started on the balance sheets of both and the future revenue potential of both. They’re heavily skewed in Palantir favor and yet we’re 1/2 the market cap…No, no manipulation happening here…"
this is a $18-24 stock !!
"since I bought PLTR I have seen stock up and down several times and instead I buy and sell I was just watching , after 6 months is exacly at the same price that I bought ..is my strategy wrong ? If I traded instead of waiting I would get 3 times more as this have the same and lots of patience ..."
falling knife...keeps sinking down and down
"PLTR new deal on medicaid medicare system in patternship see news feed.. very active PLTR, growth hyper acceleration, right now through 1st quarter 2022"
"I was expecting great things out of this company, but I am just about to give up. I am just about even on my buy price, but it appears to go nowhere even when new contracts are announced. I am going to give it till the end of the month and if it doesn't go up, it is gone."
Can't market perform ever. Everything is up big today. PLTR getting left in the dust by all meme stocks. Ouch. Any gains from the last two days are gone by end of week. Dead money here.
They are trying to accumulate shares with out bumping the share price up.The ticker tells the tale or level 2 if your broker offers it.
You know tomorrow will be a take your profit day but PLTR is in RED so more red!!!!!!
To the toilet  what’s the excuse now
"Longs have a great weekend. New contracts coming in and we have great leadership. If anyone complains about the company just tell them, no one forced you to buy the company and move along these are not the droid's you're looking for "
If the ascent continues then you know those big fund large buy orders have been completed
Strong upside ahead per seeking alpha...$40's
been here for 9 months and went no where but down and lost money
Are we rich yet? I have been asking since last Feb
There is a lot of new business related with government sectors every quarter. Why is the commercial sector not viewing PLTR in the same fashion ?
Added to my position today bringing my total share count to 684.
"John, you better learn to read financial reports. $PLTR is the one that is dead, not ZM. Zoom (ZM) is still growing revenues at 54% rate and growing profits at hyper 70% rate annually. Zoom is so profitable that Zoom is making $3.5 million dollars of profit each day. Zoom is the real deal. PLTR revenues declined by 22% and PLTR reported huge $138 million dollars of losses last quarter. PLTR is probably not going to make it. PLTR will be dead. You need to sell PLTR to preserve your capital while you still can and buy profitable hyper growth company Zoom (ZM). ZM grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years. ZM is the best hyper growth company to own."
"I am not lying, just look at today's chart it is a black diamond ski slop on a Green MKT day?This is not even funny....is the company going to be bankrupted? or some really bad news looming that we do not know about? Horrible and I am stuck. Should have bought more Tesla."
"wait here's two more, alex karp."
"I buy, hold and relax. I could care less what anyone else does with their money. If you don’t like the company, stock or management, why are you here? "
FED CONTRACT also in the pipemore than 1B !
Up a penny. Dominic is celebrating for sure
Are you rich yet? Is has been 10 months and still stuck in $23-24 level. You will be rich in 100 years from now more likely ..LOL TRASh Company even CEO dumps shares...wow...really?
"These boards are full of short sellers fake accounts spreading negative sentiments on ALL stocks, so they can profit. Can you upvote my comment so everyone can see this?"
PLTR shareholders just don't truly understand that China influence over the USA and the world. Yet we are focused on Rolling Stones Brown Sugar ban.
Dominic is out!!!Wowwwwww. He had some common sense and sold. Incredible
Another Green Day on the horizon!

"The market up huge, we keep down."
"I'm in enterprise software sales, and I'm currently speaking to, and reviewing requirements from, some of the largest organisations on the planet. Our company is bidding on lots of complex projects right now and we're doing alright in meeting large swaths of those requirements, but all those clients are repeating the same thing: ""We don't believe there is a provider out there capable of delivering on all of this"". I know they are wrong, but unluckily for my fellow PLTR shareholders, I'm of course not correcting them. But my point is of course that the number of opportunities for PLTR to completely dominate most verticals is basically endless - I think it comes down to a) they can't manage all opportunities and b) clients are not aware they exist. Both solvable problems."

We just won $823 millions worth of new contract! Can we leave $20s for good this time???
under 24
PLTR has returned -29.66% since 2/5/21.
Am I the only one seeing too much green signal ?
inching down as usual ffs
"I hate it when the entire stock market is in the green, except for the stocks that I am invested in. Seems like such a wasted opportunity. And this is happening shortly after the company signed a 900 million dollar contract with the U.S. Army. This makes absolutely no sense to me. Why are people selling? How many billion dollar contracts do they have to sign before the share price finally goes up?"
I muted all haters here and its noise-cancelling at its best.
OMG falling again on green day. Depression
More hiring at Palantir!!!
Hi my name is Rafael. I own 600 shares of PLTR.
"Guys the reason PLTR does not go up is because the big fish has access to the portfolios of the retail investors, through platforms like Robinhood, DeGiro, Interactive Brokers, etc... and they see a huge amount of retail investing in PLTR. Their goal is to steal our money, not to make us rich, so they keep shorting the stock, basically to make you loose your patience and sell. Why retail will win in the end? Because Palantir’s financials will only go up, the profit will only go up and they’ll get more and more clients every quarter. Also, if Palantir diversifies to create a program that every human on earth can use, you will see a 1 trillion market cap. Just hold, these guys cannot keep this control and manipulation forever :)"
HERE we Go! Im predicting $50 by December. This is a slam dunk company and stock. IT has been manipulated from day one by those nay sayers but the good news keeps coming. Ive been buying since $10 and still buying.
It's clearly preparing to breakout of the $20s. It retest $29 three times this year. When it break through $30s we might just go to trending up for awhile.
"Just to be clear. Palantir is awarded a $825M contract, and the stock price is at risk of going down on the news? In what universe does this make sense?"
