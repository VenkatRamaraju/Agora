Just go up up up!
Ya remember a lil after opening when it dropped a bit and people lost their minds and I said to stop trading by the minute? THIS is why. You’re welcome ;)Up we go! 
"If you look at the chart, it is trying to find its way higher....and it will!!!"
The earnings report was immensely bullish. You give big money enough time to read through that material and check with their sources on the potential impact of announcements like meta constellation and in short time their unwinding positions elsewhere and moving in here.The street may not be thrilled with palantir. But the street understands if they can’t beat them they may as well join them. We’re seeing heavy heavy buying. Love you PLTR

Wait for it to fall. Don't buy it now. Everyone probably remembers what happened a few weeks ago when it surpassed $ 27. Many people regret that they did not sell then.
I will buy more! be careful it might sink
I need 24 one more time . Waiting to add another 1k shares

Slow climb to our promised price. It’s all good.
Are we rich yet??

The cup and handle is about to enter into the 4 stage: BREAKOUT!!!!!
"Today, the first drop below $ 25."
"So, if a user, instead of uploading something where they should, emails it to all his friends, is it still going to be a glitch in Palantir? New York Post journalists probably don't spend much time configuring access control systems... There is no glitch in Palantir, nothing to see, carry on"

"my only issue with PLTR, I didn't buy enough!!!!"
I like the way you move.
"I bought this stock at $38.50 and holding long.. I believe in the company's business line. In addition, it invests in companies with bright future.. The following is an article that was written o that. Very smart....Buying revenueIt was revealed in Palantir's recent 10-Q that it has made an overall $250 million investment in 10 different companies. But what stood out to me is that some of these companies will be spending close to double the amount Palantir has invested in them on Palantir's Foundry platform. I'll list three of them. Sarcos Robotics: Palantir invested $21 million and Sarcos committed to utilize software and services from Palantir over the next six years for a total of $42 million.Roivant Sciences: Palantir invested $30 million and Roivant Sciences will pay $39 million over a five-year period.Celularity: Palantir invested $20 million and Celularity will pay $40 million over five years for access to Palantir's Foundry platform.Not only is Palantir investing in what could be potential future mega-cap companies but it is also exposing its software to data that usually wouldn't be used by small start-ups."
"When I’m not watching, look what happens. I’m going to not watch more……"
"Sat on the porch last night with a buddy who I turned onto Palantir. Smart cat who has decided to join me and go all in. I’d argue one of my most financially literate friends who backs up all his investing decisions be it property or stock with deep research.From the leadership team, to the software use cases, market opportunity and more. The possibilities we discussed were endless. We tried to poke holes and find weakness, we found NONE. Do you guys understand that this company holds NO debt and sits on 2.3 BILLION in cash? Don’t get hung up on the profitability. It’s short sighted and it’s exactly what longs should want to see in a hyper growth stock.Woke up and we’re both adding more today lol. Can only grab an extra 50 shares today as I’m starting a business as a secondary source of income and some capital is going that direction. Candidly, as exciting as the new venture is. Hurts that I can’t use that capital to add here! :)Have fun out there!"
"August 30: Palantir USG Inc. Palo Alto, California, was awarded a $48,500,000 firm-fixed-price definitization modification (PZ0004) to contract FA8806-21-C-0010 for a Data-as-a-Service Platform. This effort will provide the government with a term software licenses, cloud hosting, enablement services, support and training for each platform solution. The location of performance is El Segundo California; Palo Alto, California, Washington, D.C.; and New York, New York.

"atta boy dwayne, Dwayne2 months agoI believe that is 24 I see in my rear view mirror. And now, I believe I see 25 in the same mirror. On to 30 soon and 50 before we know it. Go Palantir."
Volume almost doubled
PLTR is clearly heading from the long term chart. Possible target new ATH?
Breakout close!
"Heading to the golf course, good luck to all the longs"
"All this over operator error?? If you take financial advice from the NY Post, you deserve to lose your money."
"Finally enough buyers to offset Karp and company flushing of shares, les keep this going!"
This is a 50$+ stock by this time next year. Keep buying and averaging slowly when you can. One of my strongest conviction plays.
"With Q3 rev TTM hit over $1.4B. 2021 = close to $1.6B. At this point we know 30% is not realistic. 44% will be minimum rate. So $8B by 2025. Cash, cash, cash! Managed by the smartest in innovation. Now for only $25.71."
I sold my 200 shares at an average basis of $23.10.. My conscience told me to do so..
i think they were filling that order. ran out of time.
It's amazing a stock with such good earnings can't push the upside button. Last week in my holding then I am selling off at whatever price it is at the end of the week if it doesn't move up dramatically. Probably time to cut my losses. Some crazy members on this board.
"People crying because they refresh this page every 30 seconds and think it should only go up. Look at the past month chart, 6 months. Look at the opportunities you’ve had. Stop crying because it went up then down in the space of an hour, go outside."
So an amulance chasing law firm is hoping to accomplish what exactly? How did Palantir violate any securities laws when it was the fault if the fbi?? Nonsense.
"Palantir Spokeperson says "" There was no glitch in the software"""
What a beauty 
Is this a meme stock?
Huge packets of shares for sale. There is no chance of growing.
I bet Alex Karp was like this guy when he was in middle school
 Mcafee’s friend works at Thiel Capital.... Peter Thiel is the CEO of Palantir .... Palantir gets its funding mostly from the C_A’s Q-Intel private hedge fund.... Palantir does cyber security. Palantir built THE KRAKEN Super computer.Last year Palanter went public (2020) before Theil became CEO.
In my personal opinion this will seesaw all the way until the EOY and insiders have finished dumping all the shares they can dump. We will see a significant rise next year. Try and time the market right and load up when you can. If you're looking for it to rise significantly in the short term you will be disappointed...
Shorts this past month 
"Palantir will become one of the biggest holding companies in the U.S., aside from delivering average 45% revenue growth from platforms."
"shorts going to buy back to cover soon. If this thing break above June/28 high which is i think around $27ish, it will never look back."
major cup and handle forming when looking at the 6 month chart. We are preparing for lift off
"$50,000 by 2123"
10K @ $25.72Let's see if we reach $27 and beyond in the next few weeks
If I can get a 15 to 20 percent return every year for the next 5 - 10 years I’ll be a very happy investor.
Let’s close that $31 gap and go from there.
"The game has changed, PLTR never looked better than this week."

Thanks to the USER error! I was able to pickup more today!
This will bounce around all morning. Stay focused stay strong longs the shorts are about to get squeezed and squeezed hard.

Great company! Something big is brewing! Buy before it’s too late. Anything below 30 is cheap to accumulate!
Very disappointing day
"I was very impressed with how pltr traded last week, there is little doubt that pltr will be at $30.00 if NOT HIGHER by the end of September.Bought a lot of the $30 November calls, also holding a lot of shares as well and looking forward to a great ending year for pltr."

New highs are coming as we lead into the next earnings report. The momentum is growing.
Anyone want to smoke a little meth while PLTR is under investigation for securities fraud?
What's the news? Why is it up?
"20% of average daily volume and it's 9:45AM, Gents we are gearing up for a BIG day!"

Due for some news folks.. shhhhh.
"Added 11 shares on today’s dip. It’s not much, but I’m at 190 shares now "
It’s going to the moon! Buy Buy Buy
pltr to 45
The next market correction should offer a nice buying opportunity
Guys just remembered what happen last time this hit 26 it went down to 20.40 if you want to keep playing with this pump and dump stay long and see this happening again and again just sell if you are profit and re buy at the 20s also we have Been in a good trend with the futures but this won’t last and CPI data is coming taper is coming after the 22 and this drops faster than moving up and takes monta to move 5 dollars again just saying
"It looks to me like PLTR is building up for a breakout into the high $20s. It always hits resistance in the mid $20s, but a sudden surge to $27 - $28 is certainly a real possibility now. Today's selloff from the new August high of $26.60 looks to me like just the typical profit-taking. Today's volume of about 41 million shares traded has been within the normal daily trading average and as we approach the end of regular trading hours, the profit-taking has not yet driven the price below the opening level. That could change in an instant, of course---but the fact that it still remains in the green this close to the closing bell suggests that enough investors are still bullish on the stock to keep it rising, even if only slightly. A closing price at or above the current level of approx. $25.85 would be a strong finish today (Mon), and I think it could set the stage for a testing of high $26 tomorrow (Tues) and possibly $27 to $28 by the end of the week."
World is going full dystopian. Isnt that good for palantir?
"My fellow PLTR homies,Quote from New York Post:""A computer glitch in a secretive software program used by the FBI allowed some unauthorized employees to access private data for more than a year, prosecutors revealed in a new court filing.""1. So, The ""tabloid"" newspaper called ""New York Post"" has FALSELY reported a ""glitch"" in Palantir software2. The FBI users and administrators FAILED to secure their Palantir ACCESS controls3. The PLTR stock dropped by about 3% because of this accusation and confusion against Palantir4. Maybe we, the PLTR stock holders, should SUE the New York Post for writing MISLEADING information that caused PLTR stock holders to lose 3%?Peace!"
finished at the high. amazing
Today look a lot like a shake out or big money riding the calls up..
"I played this way wrong. bought at 23.50, sold at 21.50.... the price went up q day later"

Take a look back at this after 3 months from now

"Palantir spokesman: When asked about glitch report, says “There was no glitch in the software, our platform has robust access and security controls.”"

I'm thinking about selling here
look at that 9 mil after hours volume something is definitely cooking
"My fellow PLTR homies,1. It's Wednesday....2. This means tomorrow is Thursday and after that it's Friday3. We are about to start seeing a lot of comments about ""Options Expiring Worthless on Friday by close of business"" (The PLT stock bashers and monsters are about to unleash the usual Sell Sell Sell The Sky is Falling... stories)4. This means that the Bashers and Monsters will work with the Mafia = Hedge Funds + Big institutions to start the process of FORCING PLTR down below $25 by Friday5. According to LEGEND: Two days before each Friday, the Goblins and Monsters will start scaring the LONG stock holders by promoting the ""Options Expiring Worthless on Friday"" story6. So, Monday + Tuesday = GREEN days7. Wednesday = PURPLE DAY8. Thursday = Very PURPLE and smelly day9. Friday = RED day below $25 to force the ""Options Expiring Worthless on Friday"" story10.

"Still hoping it will break the trading range in the recent months and move up to more exciting territory, while I really don't care about the short term fluctuations."
25.50 here we come
This might truly be the catalyst that bust open the $25 ceiling.
"Max pain for today's calls is $25. If somehow the stock stays over $25 today, on volume, I'm adding big time near the close. That means the option manipulators can't keep it down due to demand. That would be very, very bullish and projects higher prices next week. Let's see what happens."
"It wasn’t much, but I’m so glad I added on the dip at 24. Hopefully the people that fell for the story and sold, are kicking themselves now! :)"
"Wow look at all the shares Vanguard added over several funds. 13Fs filed yesterday. Many of the funds increased their position over 360%!!If you Buy, Panic, Sell, the Institutions will gladly buy your shares so don’t worry. "
$30 today for sure no doubt
Almost at 1 year since Direct Listing. PLTR return over 100%. Great stock!!!!
Nearing 50% normal volume with 5 hours left of trading.
I love when people react negatively on GREEN days. Just means they missed their target buy in and want the price to drop
anyone knows why pltr gone up so much lately ??? any news ???
a buyer came in at 3:12 and saved the day. took everything right up to 3:51 then went home. good thing.
This could finally be the breakout. Once past 27.50 is when it could really take off.
This stock is going to 32 in 2 months

"FBI screw up. Not Palantir'sFederal prosecutors in Manhattan determined the FBI employees — three analysts and an agent — were able to view the material because it was entered in Palantir through the program’s default settings.“When data is loaded onto the Platform, the default setting is to permit access to the data to other FBI personnel otherwise authorized to access the Platform,” prosecutors wrote in the letter."
"User settings and authorization are the responsibility of the customer. A malfunction in the authorization mechanism is the responsibility of the software company. Such an event requires a media response and clarification. As close as possible to the date of publication. Otherwise the stock will follow the rumors. Despite the panic, today the stock reacted strongly in relation to such a rumor."

"Blackrock sold 70% of their Palantir shares back in May, and it looks like they bought back all of it in August! Does anyone has information on this ownership?"
Up almost 12 percent for the year! I’ll take it! Year isn’t done yet either! I’m guessing a 25 percent return this year
Better buy right now in AH before news hits publicly tomorrow!
if this goes green today I'll never consider a bears point of view on this board again

Society has slowly been progressing into data-centered analytics and software. The use cases of their platforms are only going to grow. Not to mention their consistent stream of revenue from government contracts. I have no doubt this will be a $100 stock in 2-3 years.

Why buy at $45......when u can buy at $26?
"Like a Circus Act , Barnum and Bailey, aka the snake bite in the desert."
"It seems like there is a lot of short interest on PLTR. Look at price of 9/3 37C today. Sold blocks of 10 for $0.02 this morning, surprised these calls have any value at all. My guess is shorts are buying these calls to reduce their own tail end risk. Either that or someone is playing scratch-offs with PLTR.As a long, selling deep OTM calls and strategically accumulating a position on the dips has worked well so far. Many short and put holders on this board will complain about insider selling, but the matter of fact is they are swimming against the company revenue growth.GLTAL"
Who’s holding for $50+?
40 million (half of today's volume and equal to Monday's Volume) of volume into the close - 6 million in the first 15 minutes of after hours. Something big is about to happen..........
I’ll take these little 1% gain days every day until this thing breaks out huge
"Regarding PLTR software security issue -""In an email, Palantir spokeswoman Lisa Gordon said its platform was not to blame for the mishap and had strong access and security controls. She added that the FBI ""has rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns, which, in this case, the end user did not follow.""""- So apparently, looks like it is more of a configuration issue."

"so, simultaneously all five insiders decide to unload millions of shares. a first. oddly somehow all of these supposedly previously booked sales occurred on the same day, the form 4's for the sales being released on the 24th. then, the following day, the 25th at 1:00 pm, the new york post releases a story about the feds unauthorized access of information through palantir's impenetrable software and the stock sells off brutally. not to worry though, mysteriously for the next two days after that the stock rallies off it's lows on high volume and on monday the 30th hits 26.60 then proceeds to tank from 10:00 am forward. then, miraculously a news release (not from pltr) appears and the company has been awarded a 48 million dollar contract from the US gov. and what happens? nothing so far most likely because insiders had information several days before the release of the contract info and bought in off the post story. this company is producing a rank odor."
24.65 and rising....
Hahahaha. NY Post. Data is not “stored on Palantir”. The data lives in a database and the responsibility for “securing” data is not Palantir’s. This is like saying Excel is responsible for unauthorized use of a spreadsheet. What a joke.
"When the real correction comes, this shares comes back below $ 20. Remember that."
The “glitch”(technically not even a glitch) was LITERALLY THE FBI’s FAULT!! They misused the product lol. Nothing wrong w Palantir here
First time in 2 months it has closed above 26
down .82 on frankfurt exchange

Just cant hold 25.
Breakout once 27.50 is cleared.
"Happy Tuesday all, another good day to wake and bake to some good clean high quality meth!"
Excellent Barrons article.But his hair.
"All dips are opportunity to add more. Whoever is bashing here is waiting for good entry, so dont listen them"
Once we cross $27.38 it's straight to $35!
Buy on dip. Cathie wood just explained why she is scooping up more shares around $24-25. Before end of year it will goes to $36.
Should I buy ?
"I would not be surprised if $PLTR, $PANW, or $CSCO will buy PLCKF one day.PLCKF - a $40M company with annual rev of $30M. 15 new deals last 3 months! This cybersecurity company is growing massively!"
Marching towards $27!!! I have 5 $10 calls for 1/20/23 and 3 $25 calls for 6/17/22 - I am not selling until we hit at least $45-$50
PLTR has been trying to get through the 27 level resistance since mid Feb. Once we get through 27.50 and hold is when the breakout will finally happen.
Rise!
"Are we going to close above $25, on a Friday?"
Long term range $180-$500
PLTR invested $25m in Faraday (EV car spac). And signed contract with them to use Foundry for 4-6 years. Contract amount isn’t disclosed.
Who here holding since DPO day like me ?
This should be a great lesson to anyone that sold yesterday. PLTR will be the next MSFT mixed with Berkshire Hathaway. Never sell and always trust the plan. #longLivePLTR
pltr is a Toy !
Today was one of those days when I can hear bashers and shorties sob. One of the most satisfying sounds in the world.
"Lives were sadly lost in the Afgan airport bombing, but could have been worse. Thanks to Palantir it was not. I am sure they were using their AI algos to track what was going on in Afgan and was able to provide info to the US govt and intelligence agencies who provided early warning and also took one out with a drone, therefore, saving many lives I am sure."
Market Smith indicates pivot pt at $25.94
I'm up 145%. ;)
Institutional ownership grew to 25.31%933 total887 long only15 short only31 long/short
read the article in NY Postreally nothing important no hack no bug no Pltr fault only noise for nothing. this is not snowflake
"Karp selling today for tax purposes and because if he doesn't the options expire. Don't over think it. ""David A. Glazer - Chief Financial Officer Thanks Benjamin. You’re referring to the scheduled sales you see from Karp a few times a month each month that started earlier this year. As I mentioned on the call last quarter in Q1, Karp was granted a large number of options 10 years ago that expire in December at the end of this year. In short, if he doesn’t exercise the options before then, he will lose all the shares.So far in 2021, Karp has exercised roughly 40 million of those options, selling half of the shares and using the funds to exercise and hold the remaining half. To put this into perspective, Karp has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in income taxes this year as part of these transactions and will likely owe a couple of hundred million more by the end of the year. For the roughly 27 million options that are set to expire at the end of December, he’s scheduled to sell half of them and then use funds he receives to exercise and hold the other half."""
Finally enough buyers to over come Karp and friends selling! Leta keep it up!
"To everyone saying “buy”, you should have already bought before now. At some point, you’re paying too much and exposing yourself to risk. I bought a little under 4500 shares but I did it a long time ago and stopped buying (avg of $20). Keep this in mind as you expose yourself to risks and an unpredictable market. I’m long PLTR and will never sell but don’t spend money you’re not afraid to see disappear. You have to possess the conviction to see your stock drop significantly and not sell. Good luck, all! "
Hey Pete did the MM pay you off?
And here come the ambulance chasers for the FBI glitch! Scooping up more shares lol
who has held this since December with 5k shares or more?
"easy slop drop to 23.20 easy,, then lappers begging for 30,a vicious unstoppable manipulated fund cycle."
"Major resistance at 26.18, HOLD THE LINE!"
Who just bought???
"IWF - ishares Russel 1000 growth ETF. $140 million buy recently, Blackrock is thinking ahead Lol."
I have a bad feeling about tomorrow. turn around Tuesday
$27 by power hour
"Green day, all the money is going to FANG and Tesla. and $GSAT"
Today is meant to reach 27!
I agree with El pappy. that's why if you look at my last post I sold out and bought baba. this morning alone pre-markets up 9 bucks. probably will be over 200 in September. then I'll fall back the LTR when it dips back to 23.
"don't ever trust pltr stock,,its like a viper."
After hours is at 24.99! Lmao
Palantir still has eyes on the Taliban/Isis.... pretty soon they will get to do something with it
can not break $25.74 Karp has a sell order t $25.74 x 1.0000.0000.0000.
Thanks for the discount

"Congrats to all longs! -Not with you at this time, unfortunately. But you are worth it. Good call "
Good things for longs!
Look I bought at 25.41  now is dropping.... Sorry... My fault!

James seem to have disappeared from the board. Maybe he is gearing up to purchase my shares soon.
"Palantir spokesman: The customers also has rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns, which, in this case, the end user did not follow."
"My fellow longs we have a continuation diamond. The price has broken upward out of a consolidation period, suggesting a continuation of the prior uptrend. Target price range 35 -37ish.... Trend Duration....105 days. So it's going to be a Good December. Merry Christmas "

"Do you think, Kabul Airport attack was already detected by Palantir and US Government was able to generate an advance warning......??"
make a note of this PLTR will be over 34 at the end of the year.
Avg of 26.8 ..should I just sell if it reaches 26.8 now and come back when Karp is done with his selling?
Too much insider selling and CEO dumping shares for my taste.
To the toilet again can’t hold anything abs what’s the excuse because futures are red what about yesterday 139 point
