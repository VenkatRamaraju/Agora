It would be nice to see $PLTR getting a huge slice of the JEDI contract or all of it.
Volume 100 Mil WOW
. Originally bought in at $10 and added throughout. Glad to see it climbing to $27 and beyond. An amazing company with an amazing future without selling our country out to China.
This stock blast through red markets like nothing
"The daily chart breaks out of the volume zone of the volume price range.The price action is ""1, 2, 3 setup"" that rounds up the high price without updating the low price.I look forward to a big rise in PLTR in the future."
"Watch how this Viper bites you again,,the Anchor will drop to 23,it can't help itself !!"
"serious question for longs, why shouldn't I sell this now and back in after crash is done? anybody thinks this would go below 20? please help out"
Let's have another day of double the daily volume average...
"Now that PLTR is in the radar upgrades are going to begin rolling in. Everytime a stock breaks out companies like Morgan Stanley, Goldman and the major banks begin to get behind it. Today’s 2x volume of 100+ shares traded shows interest by the big cats… this is interesting! Holding strong and long buddies, we going to $75+"
Finally broke $27. A very strong showing.
"PLTR will become a ""freight train""........with share prices rocketing to $180+"
Where’s all the bashers that said this couldn’t break $27?
This is a $200 stock waiting to happen.
How many of you believe PLTR is a $180 plus stock?
The days of 20-25 are over. You had your chance to accumulate.
"look like big news coming , big contract"
buy and hold for 3-5 years and be rewarded. not sure why that is so difficult for so many
$30 could hit today
Buy now or cry later
congrats to the true longs y’all know who you are.. enjoy it
"I can confidently say, for like the fifth time, that soon we won't see 20 something again. Great day, great future, I have way to few shares"
"This morning's action should help clean up the short badmouthing on this board. We can only hope, eh?Don't forget to watch Karp on CNBC this afternoon!"
we are coming for you candian federal pension plan who bought at 35.
This WeJo & palantir partnership is massive; this is only the beginning!
Cramer’s lightning round: Palantir is a ‘very good company’ and a buy
Breaking out to 33$
"Not for it, but I guess it's somewhat safe to assume there are shorts who will make money here today"
Glad I went all in at $9...
Are we rich yet??
Wonderful to have invested in a company which has NOTHING to do with China.
35 will be the next RL
Patience is the key here. You will never make money without patience. It will be going back to $40 by the end of this year.
"Some are panic sellers. I myself, am a panic buyer."
PLTR: The word is spreading! Share price should rise like a bolt of lighting in the night sky!
"After some years, Palantir might breakup into two cos : one for Govt work Gautam which requires high level of clearance and one co for the commercial contracts. This is considering the fact that lot of institutions are not comfortable investing in cos who work for Govt and Arm forces "
Just now breaking out past the 27 resistance after 7 months of trying to break it. Next stop low 30s.
"If anyone wants to sell, I am up for buying it :)"
"PLTR, PATH and BTC! That’s all you need."
I own 12000 shares average 27.60
Son: hey dad it is a video call...you put your phone like a mirror dad!!!....Dad: How is that?Son: duh..is that how you hold your mirror?!?LOL...makes me smile all the time....
"Honest question to those who are Bearish about PLTR:Can you explain why PLTR has breached the $27.xx wall of resistance today?Is this just another temporary event, and PLTR will go back down to $12? In the next 2 weeks?"
So glad I went big early and stopped buying. Bought @ $9 and low-20s for an avg of $20. Let's enjoy the ride from here to many hundreds of dollars (and more).
"Hey Pat “No-Moore”, You’ve been bashing here nonstop since $18. In case you haven’t noticed, we are now over $28. I’m just curious, how do you measure success? Rhetorical question, I muted you a long time ago. From my calculations, you’re a colossal failure. "
should we see more upside next week?
Just your daily reminder to go LONG. Cheers
"Hey - $25.10 to $28.70 in one week, well done longs."
They just took out the 29 C's
"Pltr CEO on CNBC after the bell today at 3PM CST, wonder what he has to say? It can’t be bad to get this kind of exposure.T"
"Update on my beloved PLTR stock...My PLTR sell order got filled this morning at the $27.xx level...Now I can relax and diversify my portfolioI was 100% invested in PLTR and it was a rollercoaster for about 7 months...I am now taking a break for the rest of this week, while looking for some stocks to make me a millionaire in the next five years (It's good to dream BIGLY)Thanks to all for the feedback throughout the last 7 months...I hope that our beloved PLTR keeps going up"
What a week! Looks like I'll be taking the wife out for dinner tonight!
Even Cramer likes us now.
How’s it taste bears
"here we go, breaking out "
ting ting ting ting ting... we have a winner....PLTR at $29!!!!
I’ve been not really paying attention to this stock when it was stagnate at 19 when I was holding and finally on a big big up trend lfg
"After we break up $27.5, most likely it will trade between $28 and $31 for 1-2 months, and then break above $31. Reason is currently the 50 sma is still under 200 sma. Until all moving averages lines are bullish pattern, PLTR will truly take off. So guys just be patient."
This is PLTR today. Isn't that amazing?
"Take my advice from someones who's been around the block a few times - as soon as your average guy on the street starts telling you to buy a stock, run for the hills and sell."
"just after the bell, volume of 66,605,853 people covering. This usually lasts till 5pm...alot of noise in the market. Still holding my >6,000 shares. Let's go PLTR and break 30!"
I want $45
My crystal ball tells me close today at 27.51.
"So, I’m golfing today, not watching—-again—-and…."
I really like this company but I don’t understand why it’s suddenly overvalued compared to several other great companies I own or am buying soon.
PLTR the future? $180 plus .............
Analysts should upgrade their price targets
Something is wrong
Reports PLTR working on revolutionizing automotive & mobility Wejo Data Ecosystems!!!
This will be a 3 digits stock 2-3 years from now .. been accumulating since 9 bucks and been adding lately !! It is not the same company anymore as it adds more contracts along the way ..
Strong week.
With this move today we are beating the S&P 500 and up over 21% year to date & the year isn’t over!
Finally enough buyers to over take Karp and friends selling!
I’m holding this baby until at least 2025. I know it will be a $150 stock by then. Cheers true longs
I don't know if anyone remembers when I said make a note of that PLTR will reach and pass 30$ within a month this is now where we heading. it will be over 32 $ very soon.
"Remember in May when it dropped? 2,500 shares @ 18.5 on that day"
This could end up at $29 plus today......
388 shares at $15. Holding until 1000% up
"WATCH for possible breakout above 29.48, no resistance in area just above.Type: Continuation breakout from single resistance.Target: 33.85"
Tequila!
Upgrades coming very soon and with big targets!
"Relax, for the first time sentiment is on its side..."
Is $30 possible in a final hour frenzy for shares?
Can we push to $30 today!!!
"Wish I knew that a company like this existed back in October, oh well still in at $23"
Two most annoying shorts here were Nancy and Pat. Nancy had a stop loss at $26.99 and is gone for good. Pat's stop loss should be somewhere around $29.99. All shorts will be DESTROYED next week!
The ones that sold at 27 are crying now.
"CramerPalantir: ""Palantir is a buy. They have special technology. I wish we knew all the contracts because it's involved with the government. ...They are very good company and I say you should buy Palantir."""
God daaaaannnnggg 30$ soon!
And there it is……what we’ve all been waiting for…..
did CathyWood sold her position ?
29.26 or 28.39
$29 plus?
"IBD: A solid rally into the close from key levels triggered buying opportunities for several stocks, including Microsoft and Palantir."
Nice opening...
I have been in since 10 and not going anywhere. Wait two years and retire if youpick up enough shares now.
And closed green! Green is green!
It didn't like 28$ much.. Keep trying
let's close over 30
Where’s Pat no more?
Today is gonna be an interesting day
Sold at 29 for a nice 35% gain. Thanks pltr
"Thank You Palantir...875 sh @ $28.41 basis, finally"
"It's about time for some of you to think you're timing the market and bringing me my next dip to buy more...Go ahead, I'll wait :)"
Bought calls today and will hold
Did Jim Cramer just say he likes pltr
Im retiring early and hopefully I have enough time to buy more before this rockets up to $100! BULLISH https://marketdeepview.com/2021/09/18/a-way-to-retire-early-palantir-pltr/
Remember when this went to $25.10 a few days ago and people panic sold?I panic bought! ;)
"when Jim Cramer just say he likes pltr, then it is time to sell. Doing the opposite of what he recommended created pot of gold for me. What say you?"
Who is still holding and not selling?
Wow that volume. You are going to regret it if you sell now and miss the rest of the ride.
"We need a big contract to break out the 27.50 and will not look back. Buy on dips and Hold. I try to be more diversified but, I just can’t find a better company that can and will disrupt the technology like Palantir. Don’t miss this boat."
Congratulations to all the Longs that kept buying the dip at $18 $20 $22 $24 Buckle up we are about to take off
"Glad I didn’t sell at 18$, long term baby!"
"I guess it’s lobsters for dinner.Dear shorties and spammers, how are things on the other side?"
come on let's close at 29 or above
Breakout!
Closing $30 plus
"Double daily volume, now, I am not a mathematician but I would say that is due to buying, not selling."
Holding 23k shares @ $14/share…IMO this stock will be > $100 share in the next two years.
where are all the shorts?
Volume is almost double the daily average. Hold strong.
She’s a runner she’s a track star!!!
"So is the ""Palantir for Financial Management"" one of the new products Karp was referring to? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkz4J0vjxAQ"
"This seems to always, at some point, retrace. But that’s when it’s an optimum opportunity to either average up, or average down."
PLTR could be over $100 worth in less than year. Compare revenue and earning growth with other companies of this type
Haven't had time to way in on the recent movement by PLTR. But hang on longs this ship has just started to set sail. We are going to have so many different channels of revenue. This is going to be the next BERK but with a totally different umbrella of companies.
BOOOM. The CEO will drop millions of shares.
"check the chart ppl, tomorrow we battle with $29 wall, lets go."
"remember...longer the consolidation phase, the higher the break out. looking forward the next week. have a great weekend y'all"
"I loaded the boat at $22.75, oh yeah!"
Together from 9$ and still hold. iam very patient person
After hours looks strong!!
Folks don’t forget PLTR investing to some several start ups company if this start up is successful then longterm investor like me will be successful as well !
Don’t panic….Look at the one month chart!!!!!GLTA
Next stop $31.15.
clear cup and handle formed watch for the break out
Who believe PLTR will reach $45 (52 week high) at first DPO anniversary ?
Chun Chan did you delete your original message? The one from this morning where you stated shorting at $27.10 pre-market as you were certain this was going down? Holding tight I hope?
time to intraday short this.
"There were years that $AMZN fell down 70% and 90% and $FB after IPO fell by almost 50% and you know the rest of it. I bought them both and I am in really big profits. Never sold a share and not planning any time $WISH just became public this year. They have $1.5B in cash, MC of $4B and revenue of almost $3B. They had a not great Q and analysts decided to hammer it down. Long term I think it’s amazing opportunity to buy at this levels. Millions of users globally, great management team, and huge potential. Do your DD.. I am adding WISH to my long holds such as FB, AMZN, $AAPL and $PLTR"
LOL - I can't help but laugh...Where are our resident bears who know this price action o so so well? :)
Palantir is really showing some strength through this selloff. This is the Quadruple Witch day today.
"Again, thank you whoever panic sold me their shares after the “FBI glitch” and the UK deal. I’ll panic hold them for you. "
Looks like everyone is jumping in!!
I'm thinking.......$40 plus by end of November.
Big data has endless growth ... the more time goes on ... the more data .... easiest investment
Incredible volume
You sold at 27 and went short?
"15 minutes before a possible ""feeding frenzy"" of PLTR shares in the last trading hour."
$30 plus?
Took 6 months to get back to this price point...I'm trimming off some nice gains...have a great weekend!!!
Imagine the people who were saying a few days ago that they sold and are going to buy back under $20....
Very bullish trend. Good chance to breakthrough $30 and beyond. Co fundamental is very strong.
Major exec of Service Now owns shares of PLTR. He comments that PLTR platforms are critical.
Is this shaping up .... to be a 3-10% day??
Not sure about tomorrow but the future is looking good.
Buy now baby
Love how even the after hours closed green.
One would think....Upgrades have to be coming?
"Shorties pain is terrible from here all the way up to the peaks & valleys between the excruciating $40-60, and may radiate towards the periphery around the 80's"
4000 at $22 ... holding strong
"I panic………bought……another 500 shares….. Before this ish takes off and I’m left in my moms basement when this ish hits $150-200 in the next 2/3 years This company is huge and one for the future along with $Square, and $NIO another gem that will hit $300 in the next 2 years."
"place strong amount at 24 , 6months ago , I saw 18 one day but always believe on this stock never shaked..patience"
How is the poster who stated openly this morning that he shorted at $27.10 this AM doing? Asking for a friend.
Congrats Palantards! Love this stock but not in it right now. You guys deserve it.
The next leg begins??
10mins to $29
"Holy... loved watching 1,184,212 shares buys by big whales last few minutes of the intraday!"
"Companies that have real solutions in cybersecurity or data mining, like Palantir Technologies are going to continue to perform very well, according to Najarian."
This will be $30 by next week.
Cramer said he likes pltr... Time to get out Monday pre market..  
Very positive sign today!
Muting anyone posting discord links
Literally a breakout!!!! Hello coming $30!
"I'm trading all over the map on PLTR: shares, writing call contracts against my shares, and buying and selling calls and puts. I'm strategically bullish but tactically bearish. In the near term (next three months), PLTR is likely to be a $30 to $40 stock. In the mid term (first months of 2022) it might break $50 and go higher. Longer term (summer 2022 and beyond), I see it trading in the triple digits. But there will be plenty of ups and downs on the way there. Towards the end of the trading day today (Fri, Sep 17), we saw how quickly and dramatically the prices can swing back and forth. PLTR was surging towards mid $29 but then lost its moment and crashed back down to mid $28. There is a ton of resistance just below the $30 level. The $28 to $30 range is an area of heavy turbulence. Eventually, PLTR will fly above the turbulence and soar into the lower to mid $30s. That could happen as early as this coming week (Sep 20 - 24). But it is also likely that PLTR might experience a profit-taking selloff that could send the share price back down to $26 or $25, before triggering the kind of massive bargain buying that will push it back up to re-test the $28 to $30 area again."
hold til $100 at least. not even kidding
Who’s panicking now?? Haven’t you learned anything ?? 
Told ya! PLTR is non stoppable going into triple digit by end of the year. Management declared at earning PLTR would grow by 30% qtr over qtr for next 3 years
One of Palantir’s SPACs going public. Sarcos Robotics. Very interesting.
Happy to hold at $24.50
USA is PLTR.
"Longs, dont worry! Even if the price will corect today (some traders will take the profit), in the next period the price will go up again, even more (My next target is around 31-32 usd). Fundamental and AT indicates this direction. I shall use any correction to buy more."
".40 cents away from resistance, When we pass $27.50 we will be at $30 plus dollars by the end of next week."
I swear I saw couple posts said they sold yesterday.
"Will the CEO announce another ""huge contract"" on CNBC today at close?"
Need to break $27.50
at 13:00:02 to 13:04:14...big whale money buys over 2 million shares. FYI
Could rise to 32 $ soon
Why is it falling?????
"In since 17, dam this feels good!"
I could care less if Cramer or any other analysts like us or don’t like us. My plan has been in place since DPO.
PLTR tomorrow!
think we can see $30 today
I took half my profits today. This move up as high as we went makes me suspect. Anyway I always reinvest in excellent oversold companies. Today it was TiGR.
Great day! Thank you all!
Bank of America bought 1.581 million PLTR shares and also calls and puts!! Go figure!!
"Come on, let it pass $28!"
Take a look at Nvidia’s run up from 2015 to now. Palantir is going to move faster than that did as it’s making its breakout move this week. I would love to see these two companies team up. Oh boy the things they could do!
Been holding this stock since directly listing 9/30/21 and it’s been a great investment! Could see this going to 35+ by the one year ￼ anniversary.
PLTR going to $30.
Super simple here... go LONG. Cheers
After hours action is nice. Me likey.
Only $17 more dollars to $45.
$30 by the end of the day. $50 by the end of the year. $100 in 2022!!!
I think we consolidate around 28 high 27 tomorrow and next week is 30’s
Hey guys long time no see. PLTR long term investor here!
COO is on CNBC right now....doing a pretty good job of presenting a bullish business case
"I really think all those who think this stock is going to dip back will be left behind. Not saying it won't drop a $1 here and there, but this company is so much more than its software. It will defy the market because companies are using it for its last 17 years of research so they don't have to spend the time or the resources. The partnerships and the relationships that they are building is going to be epic."
"I am not short but asking myself, if I was super rich, would i give $56 billion to a company which has $1 billion revenue in a year and no profite but a lost of $1billion. Yes they have good product, totally agree but numbers tell something else."
I have a massive PUT for next week!!!
omg...we created $29 more baggies. Do not panic:1. you can sell with small lost NOWor 2. Keep it until breaks $29....6-7 months later
at 29.50 large institutions will start shopping
Just remember we were at $27 a few months ago...though it be $30 soon...then BANG!!!!!! down to $21...took profits this time period!!!
"Massively undervalued PLTR is a profitable, cash cow, now/today. If they win FDIC or JEDI contracts or both this will double overnight. The 91 million Air Force contract they were awarded on Aug 31st still hasn't been company announced yet. Many more contracts to come. Long and strong"
slow growth I love it
"Let us talk about me paying taxes on my sale order that filled this morning:If my profit = $5,000Am I looking at 25% in taxes (meaning: my tax bill = $1,250)In other words, my net profit after paying my taxes = $3,750?"
You can only like this post if you have an avg under $15.
"any 29.29 fresh baggies here? sorry, but according to the LONGS you will be positive MOnday. BUT I do not think so....it will be another 3-4 months before you see even from now. Mark my post"
"Under 29,00$ because 148000 CALLS VS 44000 PUTS....Wath you want to pay????"
You know there is still time for $30. Anything is now possible.
"160 million shares exchanged, and a whole lot of them later in the day. We know many catalysts (deals) are brewing and something is known. Jedi....may the force be with you Enjoy the weekend, palms, pools and the links See ya en el caribe Enjoy"
