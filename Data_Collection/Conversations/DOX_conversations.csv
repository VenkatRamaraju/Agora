"The research is total BS. Jehoshaphat registered his domain name 2 weeks ago, bought put options and published a ridiculous report to benefit off of losers who believe it.1) Anyone who knows accounting knows that intercompany transactions make it impossible to sum up subsidiaries. 2) Amdocs has a ton of subsidiaries, any good company does, but no-one pays for the big four to audit the little, insignificant subsidiaries. Common practice to move to lower cost outfits, everyone does it, but keep the big four at the top.3) The company isnt a BPO company. It invests a ton in R&D and has a gartner magic quadrant league leading BSS software solution. Software generates nice margins and cash.Anyone who believes the trash in the report, deserves to lose his money."
Accusations proven false - not even a shadow of a doubt - class action suits should not be a distraction in the least
congrats longs

"Amdocs responds to short seller report containing inaccurate statements, groundless claims and speculationAmdocs Management LTDThu, April 1, 2021, 9:19 AM·3 min readST. LOUIS, April 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amdocs Limited (NASDAQ: DOX) (“Amdocs” or the “Company”), today commented on a short seller report published yesterday, March 31, 2021 by Jehoshaphat Research:The report contains inaccurate statements, groundless claims and speculation that were designed to drive the stock price downwards to serve the short seller’s interests to the detriment of Amdocs shareholders. We remain fully confident in our accounting and business practices. We caution shareholders from making investment decisions based on this report.Amdocs delivered record revenue of more than $4.2B for the full fiscal year 2020, with stable non-GAAP operating margins. Our financial outlook remains strong.Amdocs is well positioned to continue to benefit from secular trends driving customer demand for digital modernization solutions, particularly in the adoption of 5G technology and the journey to the cloud. We are continuously expanding our leading position with our key customers across the world and we are proud of our track record of meeting global customer commitments, building on our base of stable, recurring revenues and delivering shareholder value.We continue to communicate directly with our investors regarding the short seller’s report and we will provide more detailed information next week.———————IMO, The short seller has now a very good low entry point to cover its shorts after yesterday’s massive sell off. It is amazing how few hedge funds sometimes use all kind of scare tactics by spreading fake news and baseless claims, while they place large short positions and/or put options . I think the SEC should investigate these type of cases for possible manipulation act . the short seller’s motivation needs to be investigated, in my humble opinion. How the heck all of sudden, they publish so negative report exactly at the point when DOX reached to all time high, and based on some speculation. Time will tell if we will see investors turn to law firms to investigate against potential manipulation of DOX shares by this short seller."

"I'm a new holder and this will be my first report so I figured I'd come this board and say good luck to all the longs but there isn't much activity. I guess I'm not surprised as the daily volume seems super low. Anyway, if there are any longs out there, good luck tomorrow!!"

"I’m beginning to wonder about the integrity of this site. My post of management’s response to the Jehoshaphat report was taken down. Looks like manipulation to me. In reality, Amdocs is in great shape."
"Buying Openet is a brilliant move. It is strengthening $DOX footprint in 5G space and it increases its offerings. $DOX is doing great to create growth and expand its market share. Very good stock to own , IMO."
They just keep producing better financials every year.
