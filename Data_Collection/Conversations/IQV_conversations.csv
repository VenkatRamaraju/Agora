IQV is down 7.28% to 85.00
Ghost Town message board. Gold mine of a stock. IQV has such a beautiful LT chart. Great business with huge revenue. Set it and forget it.
less clinical trials as reported by the WSJ means a much lower stock price. Beware a long term secular decline. SHORT.
"Anyone feel like the market is overreacting to this?""IQVIA said in a statement that it identified the issue before the FDA and notified clients about it in April. It said the issue did not impact its dollar and unit sales data."""
just dropped by $40 bucks
IQV is up 4.94% to 124.23
Why the big sell off today?
$IQV beats across the board and raises its guidance this morning!
Too and bottom line beat again. Full year guidance reaffirmed. Should rally today.
We are selling --the anti trust lawsuit will be a pall over the stock for next two years AND very expensive and maybe losing proposition. Too many industry participants are joining along with VEEVA to sue. Management should learn from the AT&T and MIcrosoft experiences. SETTLE NOW AND AVOID SHAREHOLDER VALUE DESTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DISTRACTION. In the opening arguments WHEN clients testify AGAINST IQVIA and internal emails or notes or former employees testify we do not want to be shareholders.
Does IQV do anything else besides go up? Invested a few weeks ago and currently sitting on a 22% retun.
"Steve Mandel's, Lone Pine, discloses yesterday his 10,000,000 shares in IQV. He also took a 5,000,000 share position in EXAS in March. I like his track record."
