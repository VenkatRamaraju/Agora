We are selling --the anti trust lawsuit will be a pall over the stock for next two years AND very expensive and maybe losing proposition. Too many industry participants are joining along with VEEVA to sue. Management should learn from the AT&T and MIcrosoft experiences. SETTLE NOW AND AVOID SHAREHOLDER VALUE DESTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DISTRACTION. In the opening arguments WHEN clients testify AGAINST IQVIA and internal emails or notes or former employees testify we do not want to be shareholders.
