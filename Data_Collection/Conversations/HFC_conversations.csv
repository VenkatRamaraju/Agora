"03:47 PM EDT, 06/01/2020 (MT Newswires) -- HollyFrontier (HFC) said Monday that its board has approved the conversion of Cheyenne Refinery in Wyoming to renewable diesel production and the construction of a pre-treatment unit in the Artesia Refinery in New Mexico.Including the previously announced renewable diesel unit at the Artesia refinery, HollyFrontier expects to have a combined capacity to produce more than 200 million gallons a year of renewable diesel and pre-treat with feedstock flexibility. The company expects to invest between $650 million and $750 million in its renewables business, with an expected aggregate internal rate of return of 20-30%.The company expects the Cheyenne conversion project to be completed in Q1 2022. The conversion is expected to result in $5 million to $7 million for severance obligations, and non-cash charges of $225 million to $275 million for impairment and depreciation charges and $3 million to $12 million for asset retirement obligations.Separately, HollyFrontier said it has filed a registration statement to offer 6 million shares of its common stock at a maximum price of $31.94 per share to raise up to $192.3 million under its long-term incentive plan."

This was a really weird decision to suspend the dividend to fund a relative small acquisition when they don’t have a liquidity issues and rating agency didn’t have a concern.....
"HollyFrontier expects Puget Sound synergies with renewables projects Author Janet McGurty Editor Manish Parashar Commodity Agriculture, OilHIGHLIGHTSPuget Sound turned a profit in 2020Renewable synergies on the back of Washington LCFSHollyFrontier's first quarter results took the backseat to an earlier announcement it was buying Shell's Puget Sound refinery, as analysts peppered management with questions about purchase on May 5 call.Not registered?Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.Register Now HollyFrontier paid $350 million for the 145,000 b/d refinery, adding its first US West Coast asset to its four Midcontinent-based refineries, and raising total crude system throughput to 611,630 b/d, based on US Energy Information Administration numbers.Some analysts were looking for the rationale of buying a hydrocarbon refinery as momentum in the refining space shifts toward renewable fuels in the current low-carbon environment, particularly in a state which just passed a low carbon fuel standard.""Right now, the new shiny object is clearly renewables. But I think we have to take a step back and say is powering this economy over the next ten years ... the fact is the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel are the major mover of people and equipment around this economy,"" said Rich Voliva, HollyFrontier's CFO on the call.""And we think that despite the headlines, the numbers would argue that a lot of money can be made in petroleum responsibly operated for a good period of time,"" he added.In order to fund the purchase, which includes between $150 million and $180 million of inventory, HollyFrontier suspended its dividend for a year, much to the consternation of some analysts on the call who felt it went against the current push to return capital to shareholders.The company's rationale took the longer-term view that rather than add more debt to that earmarked for existing obligations including renewable fuels projects in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Artesia, New Mexico, it was more prudent to suspend the dividend.""Suspending the dividend certainly helped and that particular refinery remained profitable even last year,"" said S&P Global Ratings analyst Michael Grande, who has an BBB- rating on the company -- the lowest investment-grade rating -- with a negative outlook. That means the company could lose its investment grade rating if the scenario on which the rating is based does not occur.High gasoline yieldBesides showing profitability in 2020, a year when the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns destroyed demand for refined products, the refinery has a high gasoline yield -- over 50% in recent years over diesel -- which HollyFrontier considers a boon going forward.""We're going to benefit from relative advantages of operations in Washington versus California with a refinery with a heavy gasoline yield,"" said Voliva.Puget Sound also has the ability to blend gasoline to meet specifications in Alaska and in Canada, where a national low carbon fuel standard goes into effect in 2022The Puget Sound acquisition also helps HollyFrontier diversify its crude supply, adding in Canadian and Alaskan crude to its current slate of Midcontinent crudes. The plant runs about 43% Canadian medium crude from the Trans Mountain pipeline and 57% Alaskan crude.And there is also some synergy with HollyFrontier's push into the renewables market.""We're engaging a commercial foothold in another LCFS [Low Carbon Fuel Standard] state, which adds opportunity for our renewables business,"" Voliva added.Renewables synergiesThe state of Washington recently passed a low-carbon fuel standard bill and cap-and-trade system, which will go into effect January 2023. They are the second state after California to create a market of low carbon fuel credits for renewable fuels like diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, which increases the value of renewable fuels.""Now recognize this legislation has just passed. But trying to link to California ... the consumer is effectively taking 100% of the burden of the LCSF,"" said CEO Mike Jennings.Initially, HollyFrontier expects the renewable synergies from the Puget Sound refinery acquisition to be small ""because our commercial relationships are directed towards California,"" Jennings said, referring to the renewable diesel projects underway in Cheyenne and Artesia. .""But there is clearly going to be a knock-on benefit in terms of renewable diesel,"" he added.""When we get up to speed in marketing, light oils, liquid products in Washington, we'll have the opportunity to arbitrage between those two markets,"" he said."
"Wow what a great profit for such a terrible top line!I have not had time to listen to the call yet, but to me this is either due to Venezuela or due to terrible execution.One of my lingering frustrations since the Holly and FTO merger is what I perceive to be more occasional disappointments than peer refining firms. Is this because they were never able to merge the cultures? Don't know."
We get paid tomorrow $0.33 a share.

"Americans Keep Driving Despite Virus Concernsby Bloomberg|Jeffrey Bair|Thursday, August 26, 2021Americans Keep Driving Despite Virus ConcernsAmericans are still buying up fuel to make the most of summer travel despite a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks.(Bloomberg) -- Americans are still buying up fuel to make the most of summer travel despite a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks, allaying fears a resurgent virus would choke off the oil market’s remarkable recovery this year.Fuel consumption, measured by the amount of gasoline sent to the market, last week rose to the highest level since the end of July. The figures defy expectations that Covid-19 concerns would keep more Americans at home and drive down demand.The consumption boost offers encouragement to an industry bedeviled by the volatile recovery from the pandemic. Delta’s spread has put thousands in intensive care, prompting worries that summer travel would fizzle out well before Labor Day, which is the traditional end of the season. Tracking those concerns, oil’s stellar year-to-date rally cooled in the first half of August.“Still a lot of Americans are willing to get out and live their lives in the midst of Covid,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.Americans’ penchant for hitting the road is also showing up in stockpiles. Gasoline supply in the region including New York last week dropped to its lowest in nearly four years. Cash-market prices in New York Harbor and Houston increased Wednesday in response, along with futures. The spread of gasoline over crude oil rose more than 12%.Despite the uncertainty in the market, U.S. oil refiners have on the whole navigated the latest twists and turns with success, Yawger said.“More often than not, they get that math wrong in a normal year,” he said.#MPC, #PSX, #HFC"

"PLEASE CHECK THE OTHER REFINERS GAINS TODAY,HFC IS A SLEEPER, BUT MONEY MANAGERS WILL NOTICE,THE HUGE DISCOUNTED HFC PRICE, SOONER THAN LATTER."

Anybody know when HFC goes x dividend and is payable ?
Seems like a good move to be a net buyer of refining assets from the majors as they are looking to sell at the bottom (aka this Shell deal). Need to dig in more to better understand. Seems like stock is likely down due to temporary 1-yr dividend suspension - they will eventually make it up in the future I’m sure
"GREAT DISCOUNT=BOUGHT LOTS=OTHERS MRO, CVX, XOM, CVE MUCH HIGHER"

just bought some. I've been making money on HFC for years just by watching the ups and down in price for no apparent reason.
Where do you all think HFC is headed in 2020? I hope $60 or better. I think that is do-able.
Buying more at these levels. Thanks.
"Still holding, smiling, collecting divvies."
"was being removed from the S&P500 the catalyst for this drop? were some funds forced to sell? otherwise, it makes no sense."
"If HFC matches VLO midstream refineries margin , this stock is going much higher. Check out the increase in VLO midstream margins in their qtr report. Most of HFC refineries are midstream. VLO gulf margins declined slightly. Hopefully those call options workout."
Commodities are going higher and this will continue to go higher. RSI is high but HFC will be in the high 40’s even 50’s within 3 months
"Market over reaction to a good move. The plant may be in a liberal state but the cost shipping savings and expansion to the west is good. This company has been around for years and has made me good profits. A no loan deal works for me.

"I didn't like the dividend cut. The oil patch has always been cyclical, and there are many other options on this upswing that have both upside stock appreciation and yield.Indeed, by the time they get Puget rolling, this cycle may even be over."
"I told you to sell at $40. The good news is that with oil around $63, the correction in oil stocks should soon be over and HFC should find some support around these levels of low to mid 30's."

The figure marks an upward revision of $10/b from its previous forecast released in June 2020.The bullish outlook was supported by advances in COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, OPEC+ supply discipline, and an easing of pandemic lockdowns, the bank said. The Texas deep freeze is likely to reduce global inventories by 50 million barrels, providing additional price support.The newly bullish outlook helped arrest an early session slide, pulling prices off session lows tested in early US trading. But uncertainty surrounding the restart of US production shut in by recent severe weather capped the rally.""The deep freeze will impact the US production for a couple of weeks, but if US production comes back a little quicker that could be what is needed to trigger a pullback for WTI crude,"" OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note.Still, crude forward structures turned more bullish. Year-ahead WTI futures settled at a $5.56/b discount to the front-month contract, while the one-year Brent spread widened to $5.62/b, marking the widest backwardation for both contracts since January 2020.#MPC#PSX#HFC"

"Folks, the refinery purchase is a good deal for HFC. They bought in a down market and paid a very good price. They are not taking on full environmental liabilities from Shell.They removed the dividend out of an abundance of caution for the balance sheet and if in the next couple quarters they have good profits, they will restore the dividend. A year cut is worst case. Matter of fact they said they want to increase the dividend. I would rather grow the stock price then have a double tax dividend. Also, check out the slides on the acquisition on HFC’s website."
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles.

Not to mention HEP, which could give VLO some much-needed diversification into midstream..."
"Yes, HFC is a buy at these levels ($35), assuming that WTI remains around the $70 mark. I couldn't care less about the dividend - better to strengthen the balance sheet. I was hoping to buy around $30 but it never got there since oil prices remained very strong. You probably have an upside of 30% or so from the current stock price within the next 12 months - which is good enough for me - if oil prices hold. Generally I am neutral on the oil sector with the exception of very few. The time to buy aggressively was last year. Now, unless oil continues its bull run, returns are going to be just normal. Disclosure: I still haven't bought back HFC. Hoping for another dip / opportunity."

Confusing!! The pice of this stock goes down because oil prices and gas prices were low. No spread. Now oil prices and gas prices are high and this thing again does nothing. I guess I just can’t win here.

"Oil refinery shutdown signals growing challenges for sectorA key oil refinery for U.S. East Coast consumers is halting operations after escalating environmental scrutiny made it impossible for backers to obtain desperately needed financing.The owners of the Limetree Bay refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands announced plans Monday to shut the 200,000-barrel-a-day facility and dismiss more than 250 workers just weeks after a federal crackdown over a series of pollution incidents.The demise of Limetree Bay is the most dramatic fallout from the Biden administration’s plan to wean the world’s biggest economy off fossil fuels since the January cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline project. It’s also emblematic of the challenges facing an industry struggling with shrinking profitability, excess production capacity and rising competition from mega-refineries in Asia.Click here“There’s no reason we won’t see further closures in the U.S.,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects Ltd. Refiners will find it harder and harder to raise money for equipment upgrades and pollution-control gear, he noted.Refinery executives told employees on Monday that 271 of them will lose their jobs effective Sept. 19, according to a company statement that cited “severe financial constraints.”Limetree Bay has attracted the attention of environmental regulators since its backers that include ArcLight Capital Partners, Freepoint Commodities and EIG Global Energy Partners began efforts to restart the idled refinery in September.Last month, following a slew of emissions incidents that included contamination of drinking water, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered it to halt operations, reversing a Trump administration approval.Known formerly as Hovensa, the St. Croix plant was previously owned by Hess Corp. and Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA before it was shuttered in 2012. Once a major supplier of gasoline and diesel to the East Coast markets, the facility was mothballed during a previous downturn in demand and increased international competition.Roughly 2 million barrels of daily refining capacity may be shut next year to avoid further margin erosion, BloombergNEF analyst Sisi Tang said in a report. The transition away from fossil fuels also dims the long-term outlook for refiners, prompting companies such as Valero Energy Corp. to expand into biofuels.#MPC#PSX#HFC"

Slowly but surely it keeps moving in the right direction.
"If this stock goes in the $40s, that is a great buying point. Owned it for years. Go look at the charts. It always does this. Rises and falls. Then if things stay down for a while, just collect the dividend."

"On Friday, I added HFC to the list of stocks that will double within a year or two with a price target of $50. The other stocks on the list are HP, NOV and PBF with the latter being recommended as a small position because of its higher leverage and therefore risk."

"Fortunately, HFC has only a few viable competitors and will slug along and outlast their competition. Increased the dividend less than a year ago which should allay concerns about more downside risk; the elephant in the room is inflation, soon to be a fierce demon."
I'm holding too. Was gonna sell some at $55. Glad I didn't. Next decision point $60.00. And it is pretty much now in sight. Good luck longs!!

$31 is very close to the entry point/opportunity I was waiting for. Good 30%+ return from here in the next 12 months if oil just holds above $60.
$60 soon.. great long-term investment.
"Sold at $35.5. It may go up a bit more but it's overbought, like most oil stocks, many of them having doubled since November. The upside is limited at these levels and not worth my risk. Good luck all."
what about the Dividend?
HollyFrontier is up 4.95% to 30.29
This move only makes sense! Sinclair‘s refinery is right in the middle of HFC market in the Rocky Mountains. Between Cheyenne and Salt Lake Sinclair runs a big operation and now HFC will have much more control over pricing in that region. PlusAccess to pipelines storage etc. great move a management part￼

Bought HFC today.
starter position with 500 shares at $48
"I am so tempted to buy. It could go lower though due to the current market client. I have owned this stock for decades. I am just waiting to get back in. I promise you, it will eventually bounce back and until then, collect the dividend."
Does anyone have a decent resource the gives you current crack spreads per barrel of oil?

This is one of the best pick now.2Q forecast is 43 cents profit. FIRST PROFITABLE QUARTER.So what no dividend for 4 quarters. Stock price appreciation will be great in next 12 months.
I think it's a solid company. I have profited by trading it numerous times. It was awesome when it was paying special dividends. Seems to be mired in a lull in recent months. I'm well down down now.

Up up and away.Turbo charge when dividend is restated.Decling industry but plenty of life left.
So disappointed in the performance of oil in general HFC specifically should perform better then this. Strange days indeed. Smart money says double up. Idk
Fantastic earnings report. Refining margins of $19.40 per barrel...wow!
Wish I would have looked into HFC a year ago. Good luck to all that did.
"Hopefully HFC, at next earnings call, will announce a Dividend increase. It's been too fricking long and I understand buying petroleum companies, But time to support the stockholders and become relevant with a yield that is competitive to the market."
What is going on with this stock? It's been declining on a straight line for 3 months now. I actually think that HFC is one of the best out there that didn't even have to cut the dividend because it has such a solid business. I still see it at $50 once the market recovers so it's a great opportunity.
"Yes, HFC was moved to Mid-Cap Index. would not think that's good for stock price?"

"Fuel for Thought: US Refiners, RINs and the RVO The mandates for blending renewables into US transportation fuels have been a contentious issue for refiners from their inception, when Congress enacted ethanol mandates in 2005, citing national energy security as a reason.Refining icon Tom O'Malley, the then recently retired CEO of PBF Energy, railed against ethanol blending on PBF's Q1 2013 earnings call, dubbing it the ""Food for Fuels Program,"" a subsidy for farmers at the expense of refiners.""Let's convert all the food to fuel, that way we can drive and starve to death while we are driving,"" he said.But times and circumstances have dramatically changed. The shale revolution turned the US into an oil exporter, neutralizing issues around energy security, which have given way to concerns about climate change and greenhouse emissions. But the issue of renewables remain a bone of contention as refiners chafe at the loss of market share and high price of compliance.And while the program administering the use of renewables in hydrocarbon-based fuel has also evolved over time under the Environmental Protection Agency's more sophisticated and complex Renewable Fuel Standard, some industry participants think it is time for an overhaul to make the RFS more in tune and responsive to current reality.The RFS sets blending mandates not just for ethanol, but for advanced biofuels, biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic biofuel, considered a unicorn fuel by some since it has never met its RFS volume requirements and is rarely seen.Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, are the currency of the RFS. If a refiner cannot meet its EPA-assigned annual blend target, they must buy RINs credits on the open market to make up the shortfall to meet their obligation.While individual refiner RVOs are closely guarded, S&P Global Platts assesses the RVO as a value calculated using daily RINs prices and biofuel mandates for per-gallon compliance costs.The RFS's RVO by design rises annually based on the assumption that fuel demand will rise.However, pandemic lockdowns had a deleterious impact on transportation fuel demand in 2020, pushing it far below that of 2019. It also pushed most refiners' earnings into negative territory for much of 2020 and Q1 2021, while laying bare the flaws of the RFS' renewable volume obligation on refiners, trying to meet non-existent demand.""As fuel demand destruction increased [throughout 2020] ... the 'RIN basket,' or the price of all RINs refiners must obtain for RFS compliance, rose over 500% on the year,"" PBF wrote in a Feb. 18 letter to the EPA.""This occurred as refining crack spreads remained weak—and even turned negative at one point,"" the letter said.Volatile RINs markets fueled by uncertaintyRINs prices, particularly D6 ethanol RINs and D4 biodiesel RINs, have skyrocketed over the past few quarters as lower gasoline and diesel demand in 2020 led to lower blending and less RIN creation, making less RINs available.So far in Q2 2021, D6 ethanol RINs are averaging $1.62981/RIN, while D4 Biodiesel RINs are averaging $1.710254/RIN, compared with 2020 annual average values of 43.20 cents/RIN and 64.15/RIN, respectively, Platts assessments show.And the RVO, which averaged 13.146 cents/gal in Q1 2021, is now averaging 19.485 cents/gal in Q2 2021.One factor adding to the volatility of RINs prices is the delay by the EPA in setting 2021 blending mandates. This delay was exacerbated by waiting for the US Supreme Court ruling on small refinery exemptions. On April 27, the Supreme Court heard on appeal the small refinery exemption case brought by HollyFrontier after it was denied an exemption by the Tenth District Court.But news June 16 from the Office of Budget Management that the EPA, which had missed its Nov. 30, 2020, deadline for 2021 mandates, will set preliminary levels in July to be finalized in December sent D6 ethanol RIN prices to three-month lows.The OMB news jibes with market sentiment that the EPA is not expected to release its 2021 renewable volume obligations until after the Supreme Court decision on the small refinery exemption case is reached, according to a refining source familiar with the situation.""There's a lot being discussed, and the EPA has no direction,"" he said. ""They are paralyzed by the small refinery case.""""They will wait for the SCOTUS decision on the SRE before they release the biofuel mandate,"" he added, which could potentially be delivered in late June or early July.The EPA wants to see ""where the pieces land"" before they come out with an RFS mandate for 2021, the source said, to ensure it takes into account all stakeholders, including refiners and biofuel producers.Small refiners sidelinedDespite a slight fall in RINs prices recently, most small refiners...#MPC#PSX#HFC"

"Just read the transcript and in deference to WWF's analysis, I didn't read it as positive. There were numerous problems at several units that were never reported that impacted the QTR and that will impact the 3rd QTR. Run rates are now projected at 420k - 430k which is well below the 2nd QTR which had earnings of 1.45. Avg earnings forecasted are 1.84 for q3 and that will have to come down significantly, I'm guessing around 1.36. In addition, el dorado goes down late q3 and will be down for 45 days assuming no set backs and the company has a history of not meeting turnaround targets. No way to sugar coat it, it was a lousy QTR and outages in q2 which carried over into q3 will hamper the 2nd half. 2019 looks good but near term not so good.

They had some interesting insights about HFC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Very difficult to answer that question. Crack spreads are probably the best determiner of profits and pps. Lower crude oil prices (their feedstock) should help but refiner stock prices don't regularly go up or down when crude oil prices go down or up. Investors seen to combine oil producers with refiners and some companies like Exxon and Chevron are both and some mutual funds and ETF's contain both.

HFC is the best in the industry CFRA raised their target price from 58 to 62. Billion dollar buyback and increase in the dividend. What more do you want?

"Thank goodness for pipelines!Canadian oil exports to the U.S. jump with new pipeline startupBy Bloomberg Thursday, October 7, 2021, 6:38 AM MDTOil barrels Source: iStock/Guven PolatCanadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to the highest volume since the start of the year thanks in part to the startup of a long-delayed Canadian pipeline. Weekly oil deliveries from America’s northern neighbour reached 4.04 million barrels day, the most since January, according to the Energy Information Administration. It’s only the third time the U.S. has imported more than 4 million barrels a day of Canadian crude since the agency began compiling weekly data in 2010.It’s likely these increased flows will be the new norm mainly because of the expanded Line 3, said Elisabeth Murphy, ESAI Energy LLC upstream analyst for North America. In fact, weekly volumes should start to average closer to 3.7-3.8 million barrels a day from here, from current levels of around 3.5 million, she added. New course on scope 2 and scope 3 emissions that are generated due to the production of oil and gas products.Click hereThe additional barrels from Canada come as a relief to U.S. refiners struggling with less supply from OPEC+, shrinking imports from Latin America, and more recently, the loss of about 30 million barrels of Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida. Gulf Coast refineries have increasingly been pulling from Canada to offset the crude production in the Gulf of Mexico that remains shut since Hurricane Ida swept through over a month ago, said Shirin Lakhani, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group.Last week, Enbridge Inc. started its new Line 3 crude pipeline after years of delays. It can transport 760,000 barrels a day of heavy and light oil, nearly double the size of the old line it replaced.#mpc, #psx, #hfc"

"Time to buy. I did today.Morgan Stanley comments -- 9/18/18 -- ""Falling crack spreads and narrowing Midland spreads have weighed on Refiners MTD. We are marking 3Q EPS down 16% and see negative revision risk for PBF & VLO on weak WC and NE cracks, with positive revision potential for HFC and PSX on robust CDN diffs. Cracks have fallen, particularly in the Northeast (PADD I), and Permian spreads have tightened... The group has fallen 4% on average MTD, underperforming broader energy by 4% and the S&P by 3%. We think this is due to a combination of tumbling crack spreads (MS Base Crack Indicator fell 15% MTD), particularly in the North East (-36%) and the US Gulf Coast (-29%) as robust gasoline imports propped up inventories while heavy flooding continues in North and South Carolina. Speculation of moderating producer activity and noise around the EPIC pipeline also weighed on Midland differentials, narrowing it to $11.50/bbl after reaching as wide at $17.90/bbl, putting pressure on Permian exposed refiners, particularly DK and HFC. ...although MidCon (PADD II) and Rockies (PADD IV) margins are holding up. Not surprisingly, with Brent-WTI at almost $9/bbl and averaging over $5/bbl QTD, our MidCon and Rockies cracks are flattish to slightly up. Although we note a contributing reason to why Rockies cracks have found support is HFC's Wood Cross refinery not operating at full rates until September. Despite Midland differentials narrowing, Canadian crude spreads have widened across the board. The WCS discount to WTI deepened to $35.00/bbl (from $27.00/bbl at the beginning of the month) with ramping Midwest refinery turnarounds and reports of BP outages. Further, a confluence of factors (ie. Kearl mining outages, ramping producer supply and imports driving logistical constraints as Alberta light storage swelled) also put pressure on Canadian lights with WTI-SCO widening to $13.50/bbl (from $3.25/bbl at the beginning of the month) and WTI-MSW trading last at $19.00/bbl (from $10.00/bbl). Marking 3Q18 EPS down 16%. We have marked our MS Base Crack Indictor down 7% to $13.30/bbl for the quarter, with the biggest downward adjustment to our NE indicator by 25% to $10.40/bbl, followed by West Coast down 8% to $13.75/bbl. We also lowered our Brent-Maya assumption for the quarter to $10/bbl (from $16.70/bbl) and WTI-Midland to $14.60 (from $27.50/bbl). We see the greatestnegative revision risk for PBF and VLO on lowered Northeast and West Coast cracks,as well as narrowed Brent-Maya differentials. Conversely, we see positive revision potential for HFC and PSX, largely due to wider Canadian crude spreads driving Midcon margins."""
