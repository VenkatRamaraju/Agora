"Thank goodness for pipelines!Canadian oil exports to the U.S. jump with new pipeline startupBy Bloomberg Thursday, October 7, 2021, 6:38 AM MDTOil barrels Source: iStock/Guven PolatCanadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to the highest volume since the start of the year thanks in part to the startup of a long-delayed Canadian pipeline. Weekly oil deliveries from America’s northern neighbour reached 4.04 million barrels day, the most since January, according to the Energy Information Administration. It’s only the third time the U.S. has imported more than 4 million barrels a day of Canadian crude since the agency began compiling weekly data in 2010.It’s likely these increased flows will be the new norm mainly because of the expanded Line 3, said Elisabeth Murphy, ESAI Energy LLC upstream analyst for North America. In fact, weekly volumes should start to average closer to 3.7-3.8 million barrels a day from here, from current levels of around 3.5 million, she added. New course on scope 2 and scope 3 emissions that are generated due to the production of oil and gas products.Click hereThe additional barrels from Canada come as a relief to U.S. refiners struggling with less supply from OPEC+, shrinking imports from Latin America, and more recently, the loss of about 30 million barrels of Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida. Gulf Coast refineries have increasingly been pulling from Canada to offset the crude production in the Gulf of Mexico that remains shut since Hurricane Ida swept through over a month ago, said Shirin Lakhani, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group.Last week, Enbridge Inc. started its new Line 3 crude pipeline after years of delays. It can transport 760,000 barrels a day of heavy and light oil, nearly double the size of the old line it replaced.#mpc, #psx, #hfc"

"San Francisco gasoline price surges as storm disrupts area refineriesOct. 25, 2021 5:55 PM ETSpot gasoline prices in the San Francisco area are poised to hit record highs as record rainfall caused disruptions at two northern California refineries, Bloomberg reports.Physical gasoline prices surged $0.125 to the strongest premium over Nymex gasoline futures since mid-August, according to the report, as traders expect supplies will tighten in the days ahead.Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) Richmond refinery reportedly shut multiple units on Sunday with elevated flaring observed, and PBF Energy's (NYSE:PBF) Martinez refinery experienced an operational upset, according to a regulatory filing.Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) Benicia refinery already was down from the start of the month due to scheduled maintenance.Retail prices in the city were averaging $4.727/gal today, according to AAA, just a penny short of a record high set in 2012.The National Weather Service says the heavy rain and winds along the West Coast were caused by a ""bomb cyclone"" and an ""atmospheric river.""#MPC, #PSX, #HFC"
Hey can someone explain why the fourth quarter EPS estimate is so low by analysts ? It makes no sense to me when I pull it up and see they are killing it and then suddenly in the fourth quarter it drops back to $.20￼

"Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to show higher earnings for the third quarter as margins to sell gasoline and diesel have improved despite the surging cost of crude oil, analysts said.After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. That has boosted margins on refined products to more than double what those companies were making at this time a year ago.The seven largest independent U.S. refining companies, including giants Marathon Petroleum (MPC.N) and Valero Energy (VLO.N), are projected to post an average earnings-per-share gain of 66 cents, versus a loss of $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-REFINERIES/EARNINGS-OUTLOOK/mopanjqyzva/)Those gains are driven by the 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins, which assumes a barrel of crude oil is refined to three parts gasoline, two parts diesel and one part jet fuel. That spread is currently at $21 per barrel, compared with around $9 a year ago.Energy demand has recovered swiftly from the worst days of the pandemic in 2020, and Brent and U.S. crude oil prices have reached multi-year highs in recent days. But product demand has also increased, and that has helped boost margins.Product supplied - a proxy for U.S. refined product demand - was 21.5 million barrels per day in the most recent week, slightly higher than the same period in 2019, prior to the onset of the pandemic, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""The market is getting back in equilibrium,"" Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta said in a note.Refiners are also benefiting from lower inventories of their products as recent storms and the pandemic knocked refining capacity offline. Approximately 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity has been shut since the start of the pandemic, which is almost four times the 10-year average, according to Credit Suisse's Gupta.Delta Air Lines' refinery in Monroe, Pennsylvania, earned nearly $100 million last quarter, its first positive results since the first quarter of 2020, according to figures released last week. Tudor Pickering Holt analysts cited strong gasoline and diesel crack spreads as helping the refiner recover.Jet fuel demand is still below pre-pandemic levels, but international flights are expected to resume to Europe in November. The spot price of U.S. Gulf Coast kerosene-type jet fuel is $2.10 dollars per gallon, the highest since October 2018, despite demand still 12% below 2018 levels, per EIA data.Analysts have also been raising estimates for refiners such as PBF Energy and Hollyfrontier due to declining costs of complying with the nation's biofuels laws. Refiners are required to blend ethanol into the nation's gasoline pool or buy credits for others who can.The cost of those credits declined sharply in the third quarter. Reuters reported in September that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels, according to analysts."

"Tighter supplies drive Asian gasoline margins higherPublished date: 26 October 2021Firmer regional demand, refinery disruptions and reduced Chinese supplies have all combined to propel Asian gasoline margins to their highest level since December 2015.The Asian gasoline margin, or the Argus 92R Singapore gasoline price against Ice Brent crude, has increased to $16.91/bl, the highest level since 14 December 2015 when it was $17.42/bl.Margins had already been on the rise since the end of September with reduced shipments from key supplier China. But the supply tightness has been exacerbated by a sharp increase in spot buying from Indonesia and India.#MPC, #HFC, #PSX"

"Things are looking up--strong demand for gasoline and diesel-people are getting vaccinated or being forced too-crack spreads are high-less efficient refineries are closing down or being converted -EPA appears to be lowering the bio-fuel mandate -lots of government money still in the economy -people getting back to work -long term federal government unemployment insurance ending making people work for a living -oil prices are high enough domestic producers are ramping up-Brent- WTI spread widening -Enbridge to finish line 3 pipeline construction soon bringing more heavy Canadian oil barrels to Gulf Coast-people are back to traveling again-hurricane season -Refiners are paying off debt #MPC, #PSX, #HFC"
Up up and away.Turbo charge when dividend is restated.Decling industry but plenty of life left.
Should hear closing soon on the new refinery HFC purchased in Washington state. And the market punished HFC when they announced the acquisition because they thought we didn't need fossil fuels anymore!
Owning refiner shares is becoming fun again!#mpc #psx #hfc
