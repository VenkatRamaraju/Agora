I'd like to see it go back to $50. C'mon 
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4437856-array-technologies-a-mispriced-opportunity-in-alternative-energyAn excellent article regarding Array. The author couldn’t make a better bull case for the stock!
Averaged down yesterday. Position is right around 14.02 now. Sell point set to 19. Let's make some cash y'all.
think this will bounce with earnings. see Motley article.
200% returns coming up. 
"I still can`t believe I sold all ARRY before last earnings and saved myself that major haircut. As the stock is unable to establish a clear upward trend, I only can warn other investors. I would not buy or hold. If you have capital gains in 2021 so far you need to offset, I would sell. The downside danger into single digits here seems much bigger than the upside potential, considering the overdue NASDAQ correction. And ARRY has competition. They must be burning tons of cash every month . . . ."
"If you had 31 million shares of the stock, and decided to sell them, that does not change the value of the company itself but it does suddenly provide a ton more shares on the market for sale. Since the number of shares suddenly up for sale by you increased the total supply of shares offered for sale, the price drops as there are not enough investors to absorb those shares you are selling. That makes the price drop. The value of the company, book value per share, and earnings per share does not change, you just decided to sell more shares then what the demand called for so now their are a ""surplus"" of shares for sale so the price drops. That is what is happening with Oaktree Capital deciding to sell so many of the shares they currently own."
Love this rebound the last two days. On a side note anyone else notice this security almost perfectly mirrors the Russell 2000?

This thing has had some crazy price action swings this week. Hit a high of $20.43. Curious to what causing such violent price action.
2.6m volue and stock is dead 0%. get ready for a takeoff !

I was originally in for 1000 shares at $33.71 . . . averaged down with another 1000 at $13.42 day it plunged . . . glad I held . . .

"For those interested in long term growth, I recommend the paper ""Global Techno-Economic Performance of Bifacial and Tracking Photovoltaic Systems"" published in the review ""Joule"" July 2020. See link below. The conclusion is clear: the bifacial-1T (single tilt tracker) installations increase energy yield by 35% and reach the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the majority of the world (93.1% of the land area). This supports the idea that the single tracking technology for solar panels (notably bifacial) will have a bright future. As you know, Array Technologies products are just single tilt (single axis) trackers for solar panels.https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-4351%2820%2930188-4."

"I'm in today (with calls for now). Been feeling bearish for quite some time on ARRY, but I don't want to miss the boat at this price, not to mention the call options are a steal right now which tells me there is not as negative an outlook with ARRY as the drop in price would suggest. Earnings is my biggest concern. Last I can find the consensus is still for positive earnings (happy to be corrected here). I don't think there is any way ARRY turned a profit in Q2, but they will be back to it in Q3. If there's a drop after earnings I'll pile in long."
Back to 12
gonna go green soon
"This company will thrive. Happy that the stock dipped so much, a great buying opportunity."
Wow this thing is trading very aggressively the last 2 days

"Nothing but lawsuit news and it’s still coming up baby  those that realize lawsuits like this against companies are just an everyday thing realize it’s nothing to waver at.

Go long on this company and trust me you’ll see the profits soon enough"
Literally the worst stock in entire market!!!

"Brake even quarter, Blackrock Inn, controlling cost of materials and logistics, guidance is back on the table.This is so much better than last report."
I heard about ARRY the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I don't know........but it appears to me that this company IPO was just another fraud aimed at ..... yes ..... providing free money to the company at our expense.Some day we'll have to realize that and move on....... hoping to net our losses against other capital gains.jmo....... but I'm sure I am not alone here thinking that way........
ARRY is a rare gem!
They bet the revenue/income? They entered into an agreement to repay the debt? Am I right that the price goes -12.5% at the moment?
This is so overdue to make a jump back to the high teens (a visit at least). My god this one can’t shake the elephant that sits on top of it!
These are new all time lows so whoever is selling this s willing to take a loss. I fear it’s big money doing this which can drive the price down a lot.

"I'm sorry, why the drop AH?.. Seriously the company is making money with a MASSIVE investment by one of the biggest funds in the world. You'd think it was on the verge of bankruptcy."
"To point out an obvious statement - the more efficient solar panels become the better it is for arry. The installation costs shrink as they are spread over more powerful panels. A great investment to own a stock that benefits from the R+D of others - in fact - excellerates from others R+D; a market that is expanding exponentially. That song, Dont Worry - Be Happy - really - owning a profitable company at the beginning of one of the larger expansions in modern history, that arry is a core supplier to. For all you bag holders - hold the bag, Dont Worry, Be Happy."

"The industry is projected to be valued at more than $27 billion in 5 years. Currently it’s valued at $9 billion.Let that sink in. As long as Array’s executive team doesn’t screw it up, they should profit handsomely in the coming years."
Hmmm… not happy with this at the moment
"Morgan Stanley Adjusts Price Target for Array Technologies to $20 From $19, Maintains Equalweight Rating"
Yahoo raised the target price of ARRY TO $27.70. Personally speaking this stock will recover back over $30 in no time this year.
Yesterday’ after-hour was like -12% and now it is 12% gain. What the hell. Someone manipulated the price
I still don't understand what's going on. What is the purpose of the offering if it's not being invested in the company?
will be green tomorrow

"Hello, gang, from an outsider and a newbie:I have some questions, which might raise your sights from today's miserable stock price. I am interested in buying some ARRY shares, because I live in the Sonoran Desert, south of Tucson, and am a prime customer for solar panels. I have viewed the huge solar complexes around Bakersfield, Cal., and wonder if ARRY has a hand in those solar plants.2. Does ARRY also serve the little people? I have room up-top on my flat roof, which is aligned within 2 degrees of true north and south. Maybe 12 to 20 panels. Would ARRAY help me? 3. Do you have any idea why analysts (on Yahoo) are reporting the financial status of ARRY measured against pharmaceutical and bio-technical companies? Take a look!4. Does ARRY have any real competitors?5. Is the health of my liver really dependent upon the sunshine on my roof? . .I look forward to hearing from you . . . Cheers and best regards!"

better than what I was expecting
Why higher?
"6:33 am ET Credit Suisse Upgrades Array Technologies to Outperform, Lowers Price Target to $31"
This is finally going to blow through $20 next week! Strong action on a weak day…bodes well for next week!Still trying to figure out how Point 72 put a $59 price target on it back in March 
"Key to investing and getting high returns. Look for structurally sound businesses that the market aggressively overreacts to on a little down news, let it ride down some, then load up and wait for it to make a pretty quick climb back as soon as any positive news comes back. That’s exactly what has happened with array and why I expect I’ll see at least 75-100% return in 12 months. Take advantage and keep some liquidity available for these situations and you’ll succeed"
"Nothing ever happens but at least it holds the price range, good signal"
"The purpose of the this company going public is to benefit the management, not those who buy their stocks"

what now? so bad?
Ouch all the gain is gone
China's action on curbing down steel price is working.
What a dog. Daytrader are using this stock to rip retail of their money.
"Its all good. Some worries over the October surprise, the 3.5t, money supply etc. This is a green company that is a staple with a higher beta. It will over react to the market. If you are technically trading then you could be negotiating some hot water, but if you are a value trader this stock will go up. They are well positioned. Solar panels have and will continue to sky rocket - this directly positively affects arry. Given solar is getting to the point of generating electricity during full moon this increases arry's value. Some of you need a hug. I would like to volunteer Charlize Theron or Alicia Vikander. Tough choice. But I would like to buy stock in both of them."
What is going on..is this some kind of offering that we investors have no clue off??
$27 target price btw not $14 like some said
I think ARRY will continue to be more profitable in quarters going forward. Probably a great time to buy
Is this company still in business? Not a single piece of news since last Qtr earnings & law suit announcements.Very strange for a company of this size!

I have no doubt this will be one of my strongest performers over the next 3 years. Let it drop some more I’ll gladly take the shares. If you’re an investor you look at the future and I’d say the future is looking pretty bright here
Really odd AH trading yesterday. Wish I would of grabbed more then. This has some wheels and it's obvious this thing is moving higher for the next quarter. All of the questions and concerns have been addressed!
I know this will be great long term but why the 7% drop today?
"The price of steel is finally dropping, led by a steep drop in iron ore prices - https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/iron-ore"
After hours it is going up. Any news?
"Is this company a one product company? And the fortunes of the company seems to be too closely related to one raw material cost, steel. That can make the stock price fluctuate easily. And once the infrastructure bill passes, the demand for steel will only go up, maybe raising the steel price even higher...negatively impacting the bottom line .."
Only down 70% in 6 months Lol 
started a position at 14.84 and Im going to add more if it keeps going down. This is entirely driven by a commodity price that is currently totally out of line with historical norms. Once supply chains equilibrate the value of this stock will return to the high 20s or low 30s. Might be a few months though
Look at the chart…If this thing cracks $13.00. There’s no bottom in site!
Fly ARRY fly! Don't look behind!... 
As soon as the 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill formally passes…This will rip 10% in a day!All we’re waiting for is the green light for green energy!
What happened? Nice move.
All you bad news spreaders make laugh. You all know it’s going up. Enjoy shorters
my worst investment this year... still holding though. down 20 percent... never happened to me before... wow new record
my only concern is zero insider buying even at this price!
All time lows Nice company
"Does anybody knows who are the steel suppliers to this company? Are they domestic or international? As the infrastructure bill goes through the congress and when it passes, the price of steel will only have more upward movement, that would affect ARRY's bottom line. Is the company has any other alternate raw material that are under consideration? Polymers?"
Thank god it’s up 5% today to somewhat cushion my 60% loss in the last few weeks.....

They could have blown out earnings & the shorts would have still clipped this stock!
I sold right before earnings because I was convinced they would report a loss. Super confused by this is down after the earnings report and especially the $500 million investment. I will be back in first thing in the morning especially if this is still down.￼

I bought 400 shares. Great company with good product in a growing market. Looking forward to election and next earnings.
I bought after the stock ranked when Q1 earnings came out. I know a few of the leaders and was hoping the stock would bounce back. Will hold for a year before considering moving on. Leadership needs a chance to prove themselves…

"I think steel price is overblown at this point. The initial concern was that contracts were locked in with lower steel price and when it doubled ARRY had to start buying at twice the price while selling inventory built at half the price. All new contracts in q2 would have been at higher steel price which will get them back on track. The three things I’m considering:1) I expect earnings for q2 to be negative and that does not seem to be the analyst expectation which could hurt. Unless ARRY does some last in last out accounting with their steel which could turn a loss on paper into a break even or gain.2) what is the demand for their product when the price is increased by 20-40% because of steel price? 3) I watched this same thing play out with oil companies last year. The highest leveraged ones like OXY were doomed and facing imminent bankruptcy. But then oil turned around and it jumped 400% and everyone is happy. ARRY will climb back, no question. They are in a much better financial place than most oil companies were last year, plus they have the ability to increase their prices which oil companies do not. Don’t expect $50/share in a month, but $35-$40 by next year is a pretty good return."
Can anyone explain to me why all solar stocks trade the same? Wasn't it yesterday that all solar stocks were down on average of 7%? #$%$ Is this retail trading of big HF's dumping? I don't get it. Especially after Credit Suisse put a $31 SP target on ARRY. SMH

On what does it go down? What's the trigger?
"I urge people to read the CCThey are fine, margins won't be great for some of Q3 due to the contract backlog made earlier, BUT they have a lot of new deals and news projects and will have their normal higher margin on all new deals because they have a new way of charging customers based on steel costs.Really management screwed up a bit, but they said they had never seen anything like this before ever. All of this will be behind them and 2022 it will be like nothing bad happened at all.They key takeway is demand is higher than ever and their backlog is bigger than ever. Blackrock is there to help them if they need it as well."

The biggest problem most businesses have is creating demand for their products. This company does not seem to have that issue - it should have a bright future￼
Daily chart looks so good.
"bought $50,000 yesterday at 32.30. Just purchased another $20,000 today at 29.30. Phenomenal prices. This was a non dilutive event and I have made fortunes buying when people don't understand that the share dump is a temporary flood that gives you great prices for those wiling to see past the daily noise and strap in for the next couple months."
I don’t understand the worry about steel prices. Why can’t the company just increase the price of their product to reflect the higher cost of producing the product. It happens with everything else in society such as food and new housing why does it not apply to solar equipment? What am I missing here?
