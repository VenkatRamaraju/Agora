The infra bill has just passed the senate. Good news
I feel bad for those that bought this back in the 30+ range. I think it will get back there but it’s gonna take maybe 1-2 years. Fkr those that bought the huge dip below 15 though congrats. Long term play you’ll reap the rewards
Only down 70% in 6 months Lol

This is going to take off.
Easy $30 dollar stock. My AZEK is up 11% today.
I know this will be great long term but why the 7% drop today?
Thank god it’s up 5% today to somewhat cushion my 60% loss in the last few weeks.....
Will the infrastructure bill help this stock at all?
What is going on..is this some kind of offering that we investors have no clue off??
Yahoo raised the target price of ARRY TO $27.70. Personally speaking this stock will recover back over $30 in no time this year.
"Anyone read this line on the earnings call transcript?: ""we will be announcing, in very short order, a large deal with a very strategic customer that includes not only domestic but international growth as well""Pretty good sign! Looks like plan to be announced next week."

Zooming out isn't helping at all.

great news ahead
After-hour price is volatile
my only concern is zero insider buying even at this price!
"Can someone tell me why & how Steve Cohen’s Point 72 put a $59 price target on this?Anyone, Anyone?"
ARRY's minimum average target price is $33.65 and maximum average price is $60.

Solar power has a great future and Array has a strong foothold for future earnings. Look for the sp to be around $24.00 within 30 days.
better than what I was expecting
"I got out, an upgrade and big jump before earning is suspect. Hope I'm wrong for you longs sake."
This has to go down as the worst stock of the year!!!
"The financial media keeps on hammering that ""second offering"" that ""diluted"" the shares.For Pet's sake........ there was not ""second offering"" and no ""dilution"" .......

Aggressive price action in after hours (for this stock).

This is a reverse multibagger for me !It'll be fine in 6 months I bet.
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4437856-array-technologies-a-mispriced-opportunity-in-alternative-energyAn excellent article regarding Array. The author couldn’t make a better bull case for the stock!
What a dog. Daytrader are using this stock to rip retail of their money.
"Does anybody knows who are the steel suppliers to this company? Are they domestic or international? As the infrastructure bill goes through the congress and when it passes, the price of steel will only have more upward movement, that would affect ARRY's bottom line. Is the company has any other alternate raw material that are under consideration? Polymers?"
Averaged down yesterday. Position is right around 14.02 now. Sell point set to 19. Let's make some cash y'all.
This will be back in the mid 20s once steel prices reduce some. Bought in at average price of 15 and no worries here. Although I do feel for the people that are sitting above 25. Good luck to everyone
Wow this thing is trading very aggressively the last 2 days
"In one month, this has lost about 12% sp whereas $ARRY has gained about 45% sp in one moth."
"I'm in today (with calls for now). Been feeling bearish for quite some time on ARRY, but I don't want to miss the boat at this price, not to mention the call options are a steal right now which tells me there is not as negative an outlook with ARRY as the drop in price would suggest. Earnings is my biggest concern. Last I can find the consensus is still for positive earnings (happy to be corrected here). I don't think there is any way ARRY turned a profit in Q2, but they will be back to it in Q3. If there's a drop after earnings I'll pile in long."
So the reason why it drop today is because of the secondary offering... I thought the momentum will carry on.
17% in 5 days This stock is poison 
"The industry is projected to be valued at more than $27 billion in 5 years. Currently it’s valued at $9 billion.Let that sink in. As long as Array’s executive team doesn’t screw it up, they should profit handsomely in the coming years."
I bought 400 shares. Great company with good product in a growing market. Looking forward to election and next earnings.

That’s a lot of big buying at the close. Hopefully markets stay afloat tomorrow so ARRY can make a big move
I actually bought a little more down here.This steel issue is way over panic.

Buy while it is this low. I did Twice.Do not listen to short. What they want to do. Take it to Zero Well now it is our turn to make some money. Got at 14.99 and 13.46This stock will rebound. The solar stocks will rebound sooner then you thinkI have JKS at 30 dollars
Is this company still in business? Not a single piece of news since last Qtr earnings & law suit announcements.Very strange for a company of this size!
"I know people don’t normally do much research on here, so let me tel you why this isn’t going back up in the next 3 months.. ARRY already told us that their earnings were basically fully negated by the rise in steel prices in the past few quarters. The price of steel has continued to soar, in fact it made a huge jump after March of this year. This is why AARY pulled their guidance and why major shareholders are jumping ship.Iron ore prices have been as follows:2020q3 - $1002020q4 - $1252021q1 - $165Current price is $207They barely broke even in q1 when they were installing steel that they paid nearly half of what they are paying today. As long as iron ore is over $125, ARRY will struggle to make a meaningful profit. At current prices AARY is deeply in the red and will guaranteed post a loss in q2 given prices have been averaging $200 so far this quarter. I am waiting to pile in to ARRY because I see this as a temporary challenge for ARRY. That being said, the next quarter earnings are going to come as a big shock to anyone that isn’t watching steel. If the solar sector hasn’t recovered by then or if general market trends down, there is a lot more down side here."
"Is this company a one product company? And the fortunes of the company seems to be too closely related to one raw material cost, steel. That can make the stock price fluctuate easily. And once the infrastructure bill passes, the demand for steel will only go up, maybe raising the steel price even higher...negatively impacting the bottom line .."

Sold half of my shares at $19 per share today...don't forget to log some profit! Will hold the rest for long term and may add if it drops.
I think ARRY will continue to be more profitable in quarters going forward. Probably a great time to buy
At this price whoever is selling now is selling at a loss. I wonder if it’s the big money selling or retail being forced to sell due margin calls. What do you guys think? Not sure wether to just hold…

"For those interested in long term growth, I recommend the paper ""Global Techno-Economic Performance of Bifacial and Tracking Photovoltaic Systems"" published in the review ""Joule"" July 2020. See link below. The conclusion is clear: the bifacial-1T (single tilt tracker) installations increase energy yield by 35% and reach the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the majority of the world (93.1% of the land area). This supports the idea that the single tracking technology for solar panels (notably bifacial) will have a bright future. As you know, Array Technologies products are just single tilt (single axis) trackers for solar panels.https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-4351%2820%2930188-4."

If you are technically trading then you could be negotiating some hot water, but if you are a value trader this stock will go up. They are well positioned. Solar panels have and will continue to sky rocket - this directly positively affects arry. Given solar is getting to the point of generating electricity during full moon this increases arry's value. Some of you need a hug. I would like to volunteer Charlize Theron or Alicia Vikander. Tough choice. But I would like to buy stock in both of them."

"If you had 31 million shares of the stock, and decided to sell them, that does not change the value of the company itself but it does suddenly provide a ton more shares on the market for sale. Since the number of shares suddenly up for sale by you increased the total supply of shares offered for sale, the price drops as there are not enough investors to absorb those shares you are selling. That makes the price drop. The value of the company, book value per share, and earnings per share does not change, you just decided to sell more shares then what the demand called for so now their are a ""surplus"" of shares for sale so the price drops. That is what is happening with Oaktree Capital deciding to sell so many of the shares they currently own."

I have viewed the huge solar complexes around Bakersfield, Cal., and wonder if ARRY has a hand in those solar plants.2. Does ARRY also serve the little people?

"Key to investing and getting high returns. Look for structurally sound businesses that the market aggressively overreacts to on a little down news, let it ride down some, then load up and wait for it to make a pretty quick climb back as soon as any positive news comes back.

ARRY is a rare gem!
I don’t understand the worry about steel prices. Why can’t the company just increase the price of their product to reflect the higher cost of producing the product. It happens with everything else in society such as food and new housing why does it not apply to solar equipment? What am I missing here?

This thing has had some crazy price action swings this week. Hit a high of $20.43. Curious to what causing such violent price action.
I was originally in for 1000 shares at $33.71 . . . averaged down with another 1000 at $13.42 day it plunged . . . glad I held . . .
"I think steel price is overblown at this point. The initial concern was that contracts were locked in with lower steel price and when it doubled ARRY had to start buying at twice the price while selling inventory built at half the price. All new contracts in q2 would have been at higher steel price which will get them back on track. The three things I’m considering:1) I expect earnings for q2 to be negative and that does not seem to be the analyst expectation which could hurt. Unless ARRY does some last in last out accounting with their steel which could turn a loss on paper into a break even or gain.2) what is the demand for their product when the price is increased by 20-40% because of steel price? 3) I watched this same thing play out with oil companies last year. The highest leveraged ones like OXY were doomed and facing imminent bankruptcy. But then oil turned around and it jumped 400% and everyone is happy. ARRY will climb back, no question. They are in a much better financial place than most oil companies were last year, plus they have the ability to increase their prices which oil companies do not. Don’t expect $50/share in a month, but $35-$40 by next year is a pretty good return."
started a position at 14.84 and Im going to add more if it keeps going down. This is entirely driven by a commodity price that is currently totally out of line with historical norms. Once supply chains equilibrate the value of this stock will return to the high 20s or low 30s. Might be a few months though

They could have blown out earnings & the shorts would have still clipped this stock!
Stock is fnnnnnn poison
"I feel for the people that bought this when it had momentum must be extremely frustrating. For those of us that bought under 15 though I expect we’ll be happy in 2 years time. They’re suffering hits due to the cyclical nature of steel price increases. Once steel drops again as it undoubtably will, this will rocket once investors see the profit line rising"
It’s nice to see something on the news feed that isn’t law suits
"when a public offering occurs why does the PPS get bid up? Because there is demand from institutions who want to buy large blocks with out driving the PPS up. This offering is from oakdale, the parent who is wanting to sell a large block to another institution and its probably already prescribed. They will no longer be controlling shareholder and the company will not be controlled. The accounting will no longer be under the strict rules of a majority owned and will have more flexibility and oakdale selling shareholder will probably use the proceeds to make other solar acquisitions that will complement array. Array is growing fast and their patented bolt on solar panel using one motor to rotate towards the sun is selling worldwide and the market is enormous. They have the patent for another 10 years. Buy and hold this. Stock will be over 100 in 2021 mark this post"
"I urge people to read the CCThey are fine, margins won't be great for some of Q3 due to the contract backlog made earlier, BUT they have a lot of new deals and news projects and will have their normal higher margin on all new deals because they have a new way of charging customers based on steel costs.Really management screwed up a bit, but they said they had never seen anything like this before ever. All of this will be behind them and 2022 it will be like nothing bad happened at all.They key takeway is demand is higher than ever and their backlog is bigger than ever. Blackrock is there to help them if they need it as well."
I sold right before earnings because I was convinced they would report a loss. Super confused by this is down after the earnings report and especially the $500 million investment. I will be back in first thing in the morning especially if this is still down.￼
accumulations done! ~ now we are heading to $50 $60 by the end of year.~ solar power!!!
"To point out an obvious statement - the more efficient solar panels become the better it is for arry. The installation costs shrink as they are spread over more powerful panels. A great investment to own a stock that benefits from the R+D of others - in fact - excellerates from others R+D; a market that is expanding exponentially. That song, Dont Worry - Be Happy - really - owning a profitable company at the beginning of one of the larger expansions in modern history, that arry is a core supplier to. For all you bag holders - hold the bag, Dont Worry, Be Happy."
told you guys to short when it was $27. no you could make at least 50%.
"I still can`t believe I sold all ARRY before last earnings and saved myself that major haircut. As the stock is unable to establish a clear upward trend, I only can warn other investors. I would not buy or hold. If you have capital gains in 2021 so far you need to offset, I would sell. The downside danger into single digits here seems much bigger than the upside potential, considering the overdue NASDAQ correction. And ARRY has competition. They must be burning tons of cash every month . . . ."
What is happening? I don't understand the drop today.
"Two board members resigned. We go below $10 today , $5 on EC"
