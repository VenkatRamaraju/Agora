"Comments on Twitter after Goodyear retracts￼ Too late Goodyear. The people who initiated those rules are still in place.Too late, their business models just had all tyres blow out at once. They are no longer competitiveToo late. Damage is done!Goodyear management still believes what it believes. They just got caught.I feel sorry for the workers.... no longer interested in Goodyear.There are thousands of these comments from customers who are never coming back. ￼"
Does anybody else find it interesting that the Goodyear stock price in 1988 was $11 and it’s only $16 now after they bought Cooper. This has to be one of the worst performing stocks in Wall Street history for a company that’s still in business.
Every one out there put pressure on Dodge and GM to put Cooper or BF Goodrich tires on Police order Chargers and Tahoe's going forward (they are superior products anyway). Back your State Troopers advocates in contacting Dodge and GM to do this ASAP.
"What will this Annual Meeting bring us? If the Board is 'awake' we hope some serious soul searching and change is way overdue. Continuation of plant closures is not how this company will prosper. If the company is not prospering, top leadership should not be rewarded. You need some positive change in top leadership. Hello? Is the Board of Directors awake, or are you just there to rubber-stamp what insiders want - and approve the compensation plans. You have fiduciary responsibilities once you become a Board Member, do you not? Do your homework and look at what has been going on. Simply living on past accomplishments and closing more plants is no way to stay competitive. GT once #1 in industry, now a distant #3..... Board of Directors - especially you outsiders, are you doing your homework?"
"Now whatGoodyear pointed to a growth in global commercial truck shipments in 2019 as a green shoot headed into 2020, but the company faces a number of challenges outside of its control. The company has a large operation in China that has been impacted by the coronavirus, though Goodyear said it is not yet clear what the full financial impact of the virus disruption will be.More broadly, many of the auto stocks are behaving as though the new car cycle has peaked, which would eat into demand for new tires.Shares of Goodyear are now down more than 36% over the past year, and down 65% in three years. Company management is doing all they can to adjust to economic conditions, but until the macro environment improves it is going to be difficult to get Goodyear out of neutral any time soon."
GT is up 5.00% to 16.07
"Note to Goodyear management: Just step in front of a bus, it's quicker."
"Great news about the virus and those who reject masks and social distancing:The US reported its biggest jump in coronavirus cases in five days on Thursday as nearly 20 states reported one-day increases of more than 1,000 infections. ""Vote Trump""- Angel of Death ( 206,932 American souls culled and more on the way)"
Diversity includes violence according to Goodyear
Most companies that supply a company vehicle such as Big Pharma does wont allow any (either party)political stickers on the car. This is nothing new.
"Added 130 shares between 2 accounts at drop below $14.60 this morning. Wondering if investors don't like the AndGo and Goodyear Ventures investment spending news at CES 2020. However, those investments are avenues to increasing revenue in the near future. I see this as an opportunity."
"What is funny, is the people that Goodyear is pandering to......can't afford to buy a car."
"Big backlash. Get out of this stock. Half of the country will be avoiding Goodyear tires from now on for a long time. Sales and earnings will go down. They should put big ""BLM"" letters on their tires and target exclusively BLM community."
Blue lives matter and once depended on Good Year Tires... Now Good Bye Tires... People need to remember how fast Firestone went BYE BYE... Same with this tire!
Just for topic. I remember reading on sensor in tires for autonomous vehicles? Will GT benefit from that?
"I am pleased that I am not a stockholder in this company. This deliberate and misguided policy will undoubtedly adversely impact sales and bottom line profit. I have purchased Goodyear tires for nearly 40 yrs and was, at one time, an account holder. I'm glad to know that there are other tire manufacturers from who I can purchase tires going forward.https://www.theblaze.com/news/goodyear-zero-tolerance-blue-lives-maga?utm_source=theblaze-breaking&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20200819Trending-Goodyear&utm_term=ACTIVE%20LIST%20-%20TheBlaze%20Breaking%20News&fbclid=IwAR0Gp5nErtRAExeFCQ3KUDXzSQ1g1kF_5KHkvQiaCSpnheWoPJryJR7lpQ0"
If I were CFO I'd be restating guidance downward today - or resigning my job altogether. This will not end well for corporate officers imo...
UNFRICKEN BELIEVABLE #$%$ ZTUPID MANAGEMENTBOYCOTT
"As a retired Goodyear employee and a current Law Enforcement Officer, whose agency purchases quite a lot of Goodyear Tires every year I am offended that Goodyear supports BLM, which has been declared a terrorist organization by many states, but does not allow their employees to show support for police officers. Go back to when this stuff started, a convicted felon, who had a lethal dose of fentanyl and other drugs in his system, dies while resisting the police who were trying to take him into custody. Granted the officer had his knee on his neck BUT while he was saying ""I can't breath"" (if your talking your breathing) he was dying as a result of drugs in his system. But because the media only points out what they think is ""newsworthy"" many facts went unreported and our Country has suffered greatly. And now Goodyear want to fuel the fire by saying they support BLM but does not support the police. Great Job there Goodyear......probably not going to be a Goodyear this year when this fiscal year closes for you."
"If you really think a divi cut is “the end of the world”, I can send you my address, and you can just send checks to me, instead of paying commissions to your broker. It was a responsible move. For the second half, and for 2021 and beyond, we will see cheap oil (important tire input cost), and a shift toward US manufacturing. How does this not get a ride on that?"
"BLM will go away November 4th,but GT no buy zone will still be in effect"
Just sold my entire stake. I'm back after suitable number of heads start rolling.
"GT has 7 plants in the US, 5 are in Red states, many Big 3 models come with GT tires as standard equipment."
"Even if Goodyear apologizes and makes confesses sins, I won't EVER buy another Goodyear product. Hear that investors?"
Our fleet manager for the company I work for said they wouldn't be purchasing any Goodyear tires moving forward. Our fleet is over 800 vehicles. I suspect Goodyear will loose 50% of there revenue over the next 6 months.
"""Work place is no place for politics of any kind, just asking for trouble.""--Agreed, and religion too."
"The analysts have been cutting GT earnings estimates for 90 days now, according to info right here on Yahoo. Those cuts are really what's dogging the stock. But now the PE is well below 10 and the price to sales is just 1/3, far below the market average. The stock has fallen back to where it was 4 years ago. I think it's fair to say GT is inconsistent with its buyback program. According to S&P Compustat, at 240 million shares, the share count is no lower than it was in 2010."
Does this company have any stand out products that would make me as a long term investor to hold? There are a lot of tire companies out there. Been in for years and years.
Back to work ppl need to change tires?
"This stock will tank hard today. FOX news is reporting that BLM and Antifa have been labeled as acceptable slogans in the company workplace, but Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter and MAGA attire is racist and prohibited. I will never buy another Goodyear product. Ever."
Added 4500 shares at the lowest point of today. God bless GT and the dividends and America.
What a disappointment after earnings!Should be at $20 not $16s
Shorts seems to have lost the battle yesterday.GT going up to the twenties and beyond.GT is very cheap for these reasons:- 5 % dividend yield at this price with growing cash flows- defensive stock- focused on the production of bigger wheels with higher margins with innovative business models.- automation optimization ongoing in America can only bring bigger margins.- get in the stock before Private Equity takes it all.
An upgrade is inedible !
"Thinking about snatching up shares soon once this bottoms out. The P/E is just too attractive. Is debt the only issue? I mean I see that the revenues sagged a bit, but it is still making profits."
Wait for 4Th Quarter report and watch the one goes way down.Time to short.
At this price I may add some more to my position
I have my Second Set Goodyear Assurance Tripletreds V pattern Tires on my Chrysler Mini van .. They are the Best Tires I Have ever owned . They are Great in every Season. Ride Good and Handle Great .and my Gas mileage is better with then.. My last set had over 130000 mile on them and still had approx 20000-25000 miles worth of tread when I bought the second set.. . and oh yes I am a Share holder to ... This is a Great American Company .. A+ Goodyear .. Hope this Helps ...
"Why would a publicly traded company ever take sides on political issues that will alienate a very large percentage of their customer base? Leadership should resign for allowing, or overlooking (lack of oversight), what's in the best interest of their shareholders, employees, customers.I've lost trust in the company's ability to make good decisions and further concerned they lack good judgement on other aspects of the business, from manufacturing to tire performance to safety."
theres your dividend thanks for playing the stock market game.
"Goodyear Tires Are Overrated, buy a tire from a company that supports the blue"
"I have been adding at this price -- could not understand the drop this morning until I noticed Argus posted a negative research report at 11:52am EST. Analyst's Notes: Analysis by David Coleman, February 13, 2020 ARGUS RATING: HOLD (subtle way of saying sell IMO...everything is about the Corona Virus and like indigestion it will pass). •Maintaining HOLD following 4Q results •Goodyear posted below-consensus 4Q19 revenue and EPS, reflecting lower volume, unfavorable currency effects, and weaker results in other tire-related businesses. •The company expects challenging conditions to continue in 2020. •We are lowering our 2020 EPS estimate to $1.69 from $2.54 and initiating a 2021 estimate of $1.83. •GT stock is trading at a discount to peers on P/E, price/sales, and price/cash flow. However, we believe that these discounts are warranted given the company's challenging near-term outlook."
Bought more also. GT cost for each tire has had to drop substantially with the drastic drop in oil. Plus the value under 10 appears excellent.
"Great buy, hold long term you will double your money and more"
"On the bright side of oil price collapse, it takes 7 gallons of oil to make one tire as reported by Rubber Mfg. Assoc. Lower COGS should increase GP margins significantly. Come on GT , lock in those petroleum futures contracts!"
"No doubt, the folks at Firestone, Michelin, Cooper etc, are enjoying the coffee and donuts this morning!"
"Lot’s of selling, why?"
"""“First of all, Joe Biden is the president of the United States regardless of anything anyone’s reading or saying,” said Chris Dillon, capital markets investment specialist for T. Rowe Price. “We’re not going to spend energy even speculating on chicanery. We’re not wasting our intellectual capital on it. Remember when President Trump announced the economy was going to re-open on Easter? We didn’t pay any attention then. We believe in the institutional power of the U.S.”Behind the scenes in Washington, most players are acknowledging the reality that former Vice President Joe Biden is indeed president-elect and moving forward, said Stephen Myrow, managing partner for DC-based Beacon Policy Advisors.“We have an established process for how it works and everyone knows it,” said Myrow, who co-founded Beacon after several decades in public service. “Trump doesn’t look at it like everyone else and there’s nothing you can do about that. It’s just a process playing out. It’s like your two-year-old having a tantrum. It’s embarrassing, but it’s okay.”And while some attention has focused on the Trump administration’s refusal to enable a smooth transition for Biden’s team, “to be honest, what is this team going to brief them on that will be valuable?” Myrow said. “My view is the Biden team is going to come in and assume everything is wrong and broken unless proven otherwise.”The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.36% has gained over 5% since Election Day on Nov.3, noted Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard.“That’s the markets telling you that this is just how it goes, everyone needs to give Trump room so he does no harm and then he’ll go away. He’ll always say that he lost unfairly but when has Trump ever lost and said it was fair? No-one is actually worried about tanks in the street,” Blitz told MarketWatch."""
"Bought another 10,000 shares of GT yielding a 6.3% dividend!!! Will be holding my 40,000 shares all the way to $30."
Firestone forever Goodyear never
"Bought an additional 1,000 shares of GT at $9.30, will be adding to average down. This is a great opportunity to buy GT !! The new tires that are coming out in July are the best in the world. Buy and hold while you get the nice dividend !!"

"This morning I looked at a new 2020 BMW 540i. It had Goodyear tires so I asked about putting different tires on it. The salesman said there would be a $1400 charge to switch out the Goodyear tires for something else. Long story short, Hendrick still has the BMW and the Goodyear tires......."

"lowered price targets 2 downgrades today alone! Its trading at the price target,after the divi cut news i*m looking for $3.50 $4"
When are they going to re-instate the dividend ?
"The managing wizards will have to cut the dividends. Once it happens the stock goes down to my prediction - below 5. The only way for the stock to move up is to change the top management. This company due to the managing wizards has lost its diversification, vertical integration and became exposed to foreign risks. There is strong possibility that significant assets GT has in one country will come under local control denying GT any say in its operations. Years ago Goldsmith told previous GT wizards how to run this company. They listened and they paid G a bundle to save their jobs. Now it can be Mr. Carl I or others to teach the current wizards lessons on how to manage international business for long term."
"Goodyear patented a renewable soy bean oil compound for their newest tires (see 2019 annual report). A study showing tires cause 1,000 times more pollution than car exhaust (by Emissions Analytics) means switching all the world's tires from petroleum-based to plant-based could be a huge boon to Goodyear."
that's it I'm done with this $#&$ company! #boycottGT
"Texas Gov stops Unemployment checks, to use funds to build mexico boarder wall."
I love it. Trump just bodyslammed Goodyear for the way they support BLM and Antifa. This stock will nosedive.
Boycott Goodyear is trending on Twitter big time
"July 29, 2019 Jonathan Benson, owner of Tyre Reviews, gave top marks to the new Goodyear Eagle F1 SuperSport, reporting that the tire performed “Excellently in the key dry and wet handling testing, with great steering feel and balance whatever the conditions.”Benson went on to say that “the new Goodyear Eagle F1 SuperSport brings the competition to the Michelin and Continental rivals, finding itself close to them in all key areas, and excelling during wet handling.”Wet handling was certainly where the Eagle F1 SuperSport impressed the most, Jonathan reported “this is where the new Goodyear excelled, offering a really neutral balance between the front and the rear of the car, while providing excellent grip across the lap.”"
"I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 but have become concerned by the Orwellian cancel culture and censorship we see ever more in our country. I will purposefully avoid Goodyear products and influence my friends to do likewise....No place for censorship and cancel culture in America. Wear a Biden hat, great, wear a MAGA hat...that is great too. Say no to authoritarian cancel culture. A concerned Veteran."
"Rubber is in crisis, there is a fungus attacking the trees that they're made from. That's why I'm bullish on this, because prices for tires will go up if we don't curb this issue. I think as a result rubber companies should climb longterm. Correct me if I'm wrong guys."

I used to buy Goodyear tires. I have some on my car right now. Looks like I will be going to Michelin or Firestone in the future
If you don’t tip the Wall Street sharks about your upcoming earnings. Your stock will go no where. That is how it is on Wall Street.

"Just bought at 17.90, wish me luck."
Look back 40 years of GT stock prices. Every 10 or so years the price tumbles to $5 and with regularity recovers to $30 in 10 years. That’s a great annualized return for patient investors.
Market cap of $1.5 B for one of the great American brand names? Can Buffet resist a steal like this? I couldn't.
hope that law enforcement cancells its realtionship and finds another company to do business with.
Sharp drop in stock today may be due to owner’s’ disappointment with enumerated savings described by company management upon closing of Cooper merger
I had bought GT for the dividend to give to Grandmama each quarter! What am I supposed to tell her NOW?!?

Listed as ""unacceptable"" was ""Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, MAGA Attire, Political Affiliated Slogans or Material."" That pretty much covers the company bias. What genius decided to to alienate half of their customers?"
So bottom line here is this company allowed BLM in their workplace and did not allow Trump supporters to show their support. Trump told Americans to stop buying GT. Stock price has plunged 25% since. Who won that battle?
no Goodyear tires for my business 2 cars and 4 vans..going 2 cooper
They had some interesting insights about GT on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Warren Buffett should buy GT and offer 10% discount on Geico insurance on vehicles using Goodyear tires.
Most large corporations seem to be crossing a line by taking political stances on things that don't effect them any more than the rest of us. Investors should punish management for this behavior. Management of this company needs to focus on selling more tires and maintaining a strong return.
I don't support companies who don't support our law enforcement.
"Under some pressure today due to Moody's rating review for downgrade as a result of CTB acquisition. Being that the market favors this deal, the stock may be much higher as we get closer to the closing, later this year. That said, if we get up past the mid twenties, GT may issue some shares to wipe out some debt, which could be positive for the stock."
Why can't companies just stay out of politics. I don't see this being some temporary thing now. They did a great job just shrinking the entire us market to half.
Just canceled my order for four new tires. Selling my shares will be next.
I bought some Walmart branded Goodyears recently.. aka Douglas. Great tires for the price. Highly recommend
"NEW YORK, Dec. 18, 2019/ PRNewswire/-- Palladium Equity Partners, LLC, a middle market private equity firm with approximately $3 billion in assets under management, today announced the sale of Raben Tire Company to The Goodyear Tire& Rubber Company. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Founded in 1952 and headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, Raben is one of the largest tire and service companies in the Midwest.Might be why the haircut."
They just got Norfolk Southern as a client for their Advanced Monitoring Technology system. It monitors NSC fleets tire pressure. I would say this is quite huge
"Many positives now in place. GT could easily double within a year, and triple within two years."
"..Goodyear Tire Company would be a great takeover fit for Bridgestone Corporation, which is a better managed and more Diversified Entity than Goodyear. The Combined operations would bring great Synergy for both Companies, and create excellent shareholder value."
Seems like a very affordable place to buy in. Priced under $15 without any new negative news. Buying 40 more shares to bring me over 300 shares.
I am sorry for the workers and shareholders. Here's a stock with no longer any dividend and a loss of $6.69 per share and management has time to make anti-american political statements.
"I know this is cliche but, get woke go broke is real. I’m not buying Goodyear stock or tires. It’s simple. Stick with the mission and be good. Get into politics and polarize you’re customers. HR departments are causing a lot of issues. Not all, but most."
no matter electric car or combustion they need tires!

"Stock price will double from here in 6 months. Economy will be running on all cylinders by then, despite gov't restrictions. People will be driving again if even just to get out! Auto and trucks will need tires always. Very positive on GT."
This seems like the story of the dog chasing a car. He catches it - and 'now what do I do with it'? Why are we not hearing anything about GT's strategy after the Cooper acquisition? Is there one? It does not take much intelligence to borrow a lot of money and make the purchase. Whats next? (Please don't screw Cooper up... You should look at what they were doing - and what worked for them - than implement some of that in 'the BIG HOUSE'.) Why are we not hearing anything about the moves forward? Hello? Is writing about the blimp the best news you have?
"We are only a 4 billion dollar market cap , this company can be sold !looking forward to the new people they brought on it looks like this could be a Possibility￼"

I work for Goodyear and it's true. You are only allowed to wear BLM attire!!!
Nice earnings and revenue beat.Gonna take off after the MM finish their games.$18 would be nice by EOD with $20 next week.
"GT collaborating with Lordstown, maker of the Endurance, on track to be the first mass-produced, fully-electric, pickup truck (ahead of Tesla, Rivian, Hummer, Nikola, and Ford) in the U.S. Unveiled on 6-25-2020 and priced at $52,500, 20,000 units for 2021 are already pre-sold, with plans to increase production to meet future demand. The Endurance will have the best traction and be the safest pickup of any truck currently available. Essentially it gets 75 miles per gallon, with a 250 mile range, 80 mph top speed, 600 horsepower peak, and 7,500 lb towing capacity. It can seat up to five people and be charged 95% in 0.5 to 1.5 hours on a Level 3 DC charger (10 hours on a Level 2 seven-kilowatt charger). As part of its deal with Lordstown, Goodyear will supply tires for their truck and add units to its own service fleet."
"I wanted to get in on this one today, as it's current price is a significant discount to tangible book value...but first I skimmed the annual report. They had a heavy loss in 2019, which may hurt the sustainability of the dividend, and they (perhaps temporarily) closed their plant in China over the virus outbreak, but didn't factor the effects of that into their 2020 forecast, which to me indicates that more bad news may be on the way that could adversely effect their estimates for 2020. So...for now I'm stuck watching on the sidelines."

Will never buy tires from them again. Companies are free to do whatever they want and can be as anti-american as they want. We can choose to not buy their products as well. Many other good tire companies out there who are willing to stand up for this country.

"So much selling and with earnings coming out in a few days, it is like people know they should sell without seeing the public release of information......how much downside is there to GT at $20 / per share? If you are long on it, is it worth buying for the dividend return? This trade puzzles me."

"Looks like it is going to drop for a bit as people booking profits due to the lightning fast increase in price. Seeing the stock dip, some will panic and sell so that stock will dip a bit more. But I think it should continue its rise again in a few days or may be in about one month. After that it should be on on its way to at least $30 in the next few months and at the very latest by 1 year."

I will not buy good year tires and I will not buy a new vehicle with good year tires as stock equipment.
The management of this company should resign for acting against stockholder interests. Politics should not be a part of business and political correctness must be avoided.
"Already, just on this message board, GT has lost (alienated) hundreds of thousands of dollars in future sales!"
"Cars with good year tires and cars in general are flying off the car lots , they cannot keep cars on the lots , that means more tire sales … buy Goodyear !"
Am I missing something here? If the economy goes down people drive old cars that burn thru tires even quicker. The cost of the raw material (petroleum) has gone way down so tires can be made cheaper. How is this not one of the best buys in the market good economy or bad?
All companies should not get involved in the politics of this country they just need to build great products .I do need tires for my f150 but they will not be a goodyear product. Just like nascar not a fan anymore all lives matter . wake up america and start reading your bible it is the book of instructions on how to live a wonderful life .
"Like clockwork, GT tanks and then recovers about every 5 years — it’s been that way for decades. Ive bought at the bottom and sold near the top 5 times. It’s on the upswing again. I bought at $8.60 and will sell at $30."
No more goodyear tires for me
"I bought a block of shares at around $14 and sold Friday for a little profit.. If it dips below $15 or so, I may dip my beak again. Thoughts anyone?"
Short this #$%$ company
I'm finished with Goodyear. Their comments and practices sealed their fate.
Goodyear's future customer base.
"Looks like our fleet tire purchases will no longer include anything from Good Year tire with this policy in place. Will now move to Cooper tires exclusively. Bad policy decision Goodyear management! based on the response here and elsewhere, the negative ramifications of the fallout from the purchase ban response by consumers will be a huge blow to revenues!"
"Been a loyal Goodyear customer for 15+ years. Good bye, Goodyear."
Market cap of 4.5B Revenue 13B free cash flow 1B. Yield 23%. Wow. Compare that to high flying stocks. Wow. Can’t believe how corrupt Wall Street is.
"so I'm thinking about buying,please someone give me facts why I shouldn't"
Why does Yahoo want to squelch people voices by stopping comments on stories?
TRUMP GETTING READY TO GO LIVE ON NATIONAL TV AT 1PM HE WILL TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN NOT TO BUY GOOD YEAR TIRES THIS WILL BE A NATIONAL HEADLINE FOR DAYS TO COME
$GT $UPWK $Expr on FIRE!!
"A slide labeled “Zero Tolerance” was presented at the company’s Topeka, Kan. plant and spelled out appropriate and inappropriate displays.“Black Lives Matter” and “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride” were considered acceptable. Listed under the “unacceptable” section were “Blue Lives Matter,” “All Lives Matter,” “MAGA Attire” and “Political Affiliated Slogans or Material.”----Smooth move Goodyear, support the people burning, beating, and looting and ban any support for Law enforcement. Way to alienate your customer base."
in feb i was kicking myself for not investing this company when I should have get in from December... I know their earning going be good..
"New contracts, turn around company, good earning report, etcGT must back to $20's this month."
BREAKING NEWS:https://health-care.foundation/the-cure-for-the-coronavirus-flu
DONT BUY GOODYEAR!
"Brian, I disagree. In the North East of US we had a pretty good winter with more than usual snow and there are many pot holes. When folks drive on pot holes, the tires get busted. Most will not use stimulus money on tires but some will use it to upgrade their tires to go to work or vacation, or to meet family. There is pent up demand for oil and travel and both of them require rubber to move around. GT will see $20 by Memorial day."
gas or electric cars and trucks will always need tires and Goodyear is the best .great buy at this price added some today.
Debt to equity: over 200!
I am out... I think this ship sinks in the coming weeks!
"In my opinion, the results of the upcoming earnings report will have minimal effect on share price - whatever the performance. Think about it. Smart money (institutions) sold out of this stock during February only to come back in and start buying this stock off the lows in mid-March. Since the lows, the price has been pushing up in the ascending channel it's clear that it will likely run to $12 by mid-August and on to $16 by October. A good earnings report could see the volume boost this needs to accelerate it's price recovery to pre-covid levels."
Analyst upgrade to$26.00
"I’m new to Goodyear. Looking at the charts,what’s the story to the decline in share price over the years? 2020 I’d presume is strictly COVID 19 related. Thanks for the inputs"
"Buy Cooper tires, made in the USA."
Buying in at all time low is a win win!! They will slowly rebound from here on out.
Remember Folks GY make Belts Hoses and many other items when your car is serviced so check your repair shop to see if they sell GY products ....
Is the bigly boycott over?
"same as usual, gt needs to cut costs and flatten. these new ventures are going to raise costs, raise legacy expense, increase inventory, and a/r exposure. plus increase employees and associated risks of owning distribution. many reasons to rate hold. they are not taking appropriate actions."
"Goodyear Shareholders, this is what happens to the Stock price when Politically Correct ""Woke Management"" run a company. They place Leftist political ideology ahead of Shareholder value."
GT has been in a nose dive for years now. But with this news its still a strong short opportunity imo.
"Goodyear has gained $1.04 in share price and has had consecutive gains over the last 4 days of the market.Today it gained 13 cents, while Cooper was down $1.30 and the Dow lost 915 points. At $6.32 Goodyear is extremely undervalued. They have always been the innovator in the tire industry and have manufactured excellent tires. Although the last earnings result was not good, Goodyear went down by $1.80 cents per share. The major drop in price was the result of the Coronavirus situation. Goodyear is positioned to be a major supplier of tires for electric vehicles as well. Considering the above and the history of the Goodyear Tire andRubber Company, I feel that Goodyear is an excellent buy at the price level, and that investors will be rewarded in the long term."
got in at 1370 bought 1500 shares .good buy just my opinion
Just popped all my good year eagle f1 all season tires on my car and bought some Michelins instead dont ever disrespect MAGA TRUMPY 2020
GOOD YEAR HAVING A BAD YEAR
"why must us investors pay the price for Goodyears politics, even if we don't agree with them? :("
Looks like GT spends too much time pushing their political and social agenda and not enough focusing on their product.
The constant tanking. Makes no sense.
"Headline reads ""GT to close until April 3"" All I see is ""GT to open it's doors April 3. This is a great company with great products who has proven themselves. I would much rather invest in a company who is a big name and has been succesful and has temporarily gone out of business with the perspective of a big name company company starting up a business with a low point in the market to buy in than I would a speculative company who could be big, who could catch on. Even if they do cut dividends, they're worth a lot more than this and dividends will rise."
SHORT IT AHAHAHAHA IT ALREADY LOST 50 MILLION $ DOLLARS IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES
"New Analyst rating: ""Sell. Sell with wild abandon. Price target .001-cent (par value)."""
"I bought a 1,000 shares. We started out good this morning and dived at the close. Cramer is talking about people will be buying more cars to social distance. I would think GT will benefit from that. Hope I am right. This stock looks beaten down."
Sales of used cars are expected to rise as people will tend to shun public transportation for a while even after the pandemic. Average incentive spending per vehicle is up. Sales of classic cars are booming. Factories across Europe and the U.S. have begun to reopen. So have dealerships. Hopeful indicators for tire manufacturers.
Time to get back to $20.
"Never thought I would have a chance to buy at 17$ again, great price"
Thank god they beat on quarterly or this would be in $15s by now.SMH!Load the truck at $17.50.See you in mid $18s next week
"I”m in at 40 many years ago, thought GoodYear would always be a winner but there seems to be several manufacturers are using other than Goodyear, one is Yokohama which was on my new Subaru and the same (Yokohama) recommended by a local Toyota dealership."
lower oil price means lower cost of goods sold. drivers coming back soon. infrastructure bill passed later this year means many construction vehicles need tires. high book value. It will take awhile but GT is a great long-term buy
">>> GT has a hard time making any Solid Profit in the USA because of the Union. The Unions are Extortionists , forcing Companies to shell out the bulk of their profits over compensating Employees . The reduced profitability from this practice leaves a Company with not enough to Invest back into the business for Growth , which also results in a crippled Stock Price .Also , CEO's should be paid Compensation on Company Performance . Too many Companies compensate the CEO Millions for Playing Golf , and driving a Company into the Ground."
Added this under $16 in a possible value play. I still think this has a massive amount of growth. Will be adding very soon again
I want my dividend back....
"CFRA RAISES OPINION ON THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY TO BUY FROM HOLDSeptember 6, 2019We maintain our 12-month target price of $15 based on 6.8x our '20 EPS estimate, a late-cycle discount to the stock's five-year average forward P/E of 8.7x. Our adjusted EPS estimates remain $1.60 for '19 and $2.20 for '20. The upgrade comes after a period of significant underperformance for GT, both on an absolute basis and relative to its closest comp, The Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (CTB 24 ***). GT shares are -40.2% YTD versus -25.2% for CTB and +19.0% for the S&P 500, following 2018 performance of -35.4% for GT, -7.3% for CTB and -6.2% for the S&P. While GT's 1H 2019 results were hideous, with adjusted EPS plummeting 60.7%, we see significantly easier comps in 2H 2019, as lower oil prices should help support margins (two-thirds of its raw materials costs are petroleum-based). We also see demand for higher-margin replacement tires (73% of GT's total tire sales last year) remaining steady and find the stock's current 5.2% dividend yield attractive."
"The stock market transfers money  from the impatient to the patient, don’t panic, and definitely don’t sell, wait a few days or a week and load up more."
"Ok many companies don't allow political attire, then they should say ""no political attire"" not single out MAGA attire...Where they went really wrong is to say BLM is acceptable, but BLUE live matter is unacceptable.You lost my GT. America Lives Matter..."
4 days till earnings! 
What are the chances they will reinstate the dividend?
Traders must be bullish on the auto & part sellers sectors in the next 2-3 quarters if this went up 7% after a 75% decline in EPS year over year.
