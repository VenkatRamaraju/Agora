"""Imperial Capital analyst, George Kelly, reiterated his Outperform rating on shares of Johnson Outdoors (NASDAQ: JOUT) and raised his price target to $95 from $85 after the company generated sales of $529mn and adjusted EBITDA of $71mn in the latest twelve month (LTM) period ended 3/30/18.The analyst stated ""new products appear to be selling well again in 2018 and the boating market remains healthy. We also see value in JOUT’s cash-heavy balance sheet, which could be used for buybacks or M&A, neither of which is currently modeled"". The analyst believes that the ""newest Minn Kota and Humminbird products appear to be selling well again in 2018. We see many Minn Kota trolling motor models out-of-stock at major retailers including Bass Pro, Cabela’s, and TackleWarehouse.com. With no significant production https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JOUTissues, we view the tight inventory environment as a positive indicator of strong consumer demand""."

"Mercury owner Brunswick acquires Navico. Brunswick gets navigation, trolling motors & lower units. Competitively I can see this bullishly or bearishly. Competitive headwinds for Hummingbird/MinKota or might this open up new ex Merc/Brunswick opps for JOUT? As an aside, if JOUT's supply chain holds together , fishing demand remains solid, they continue to meet consumer demand & Scuba world wide begins it's inevitable pick up as travel increases ... watch out above as JOUT will be markedly increasing their cash generating printing presses! Wonder if the mothership (SC Johnson ) could be of any assistance to JOUT's raw material, sourcing, supply chain needs ? Given the Johnsons discipline with cash it's doubtful they acquire any brands/products at a cycle top, but sometime in the not too distant future they'll acretively utilize some of that $187mm+ cash"
