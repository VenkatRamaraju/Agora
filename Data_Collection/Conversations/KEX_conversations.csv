"I recently bought a Kirby machine...sales people came to my door promising the world and telling me the machine was the best and customer service and that if anything went wrong, don't worry about it, just contact us and they would come out or if I took it, they would take care of it. These were supposedly independent sales persons working on behalf of Kirby's products. Well, I have had problems with the machine but most of all, can't get any of those sales persons to call back now. I contacted the Kirby Corp, and they seem to have the worst people working of them. neither knows what each are doing and there's no communication. Finally got someone to give me supposedly ""independent"" place where I can take it for service. Went to one, no one was there...seems like its a hole in the wall. Call the corporate again, and told them. They gave me another location...went there, address didn't exist. Call them again, and finally they gave me someone in Southern California by the way, who when I called them, they said I would still have to pay for them to check it out and if its not covered, I would pay still the parts. What a load of #$%$. This company and this machine sucks the big one. Never again will I purchase an overpriced, $1200 dollars by the way, for a vacuum/shampooer. I got suckered. I'm writing this so that you never do. Its best to buy one that is around $200 to $300...if anything does happen, well, at least you didn't pay $1200 and you could buy another one, 2 x's over."
