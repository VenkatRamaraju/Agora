"Wow, reading the transcript you can see the Kirby CEO is saying how bad inland and coastal barge markets are including the prospect of laying up barges:""Pricing on term contracts continued to deteriorate due to the excess capacity in the system. Contracts that renewed during the third quarter were down in the mid- to high single digits compared to the 2016 third quarter. As we've discussed before, term contract renewals can have a lag effect on earnings as it takes a year to see the full impact to Kirby's earnings. Spot contracts were consistent with the first 6 months of 2017.The inland sector generated an operating margin in the mid- to high teens for the quarter.In our coastal marine transportation sector, the oversupply of barrel capacity in the market was exacerbated by -- in the third quarter by new equipment entering service. Including temporary laid-up barges, Kirby's coastal tank barge utilization was in the low to mid-60% range during the quarter. Revenues from the coastwise transportation of refined petroleum products and black oil were lower compared to the 2016 third quarter, while revenues for the transportation of petrochemicals were stable.We continue to evaluate the commercial viability of each piece of coastal equipment if it moves from a term contract into the spot market, and we temporarily lay-up equipment when it makes commercial sense.Our aggressive actions to manage costs starting in the first quarter of 2017 have somewhat stabilized margins in the face of this deteriorating utilization.Regarding coastal market pricing, generally, spot contract rates remain below term contract rates. The degree of which varies based on geography, vessel size, vessel capabilities and the product being transported. As an example of where spot pricing was in the third quarter, spot rates for vessels in the 80,000 to 100,000-barrel range including service were approximately 15% lower than the third quarter 2016. However, pricing on both term and spot contracts was stable compared to the 2017 second quarter. The percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the 2017 first 6 months at approximately 80%, mainly as a result of lower revenue for spot equipment. The third quarter negative operating margin for the coastal sector was in the mid-single digits."

"I recently bought a Kirby machine...sales people came to my door promising the world and telling me the machine was the best and customer service and that if anything went wrong, don't worry about it, just contact us and they would come out or if I took it, they would take care of it. These were supposedly independent sales persons working on behalf of Kirby's products. Well, I have had problems with the machine but most of all, can't get any of those sales persons to call back now. I contacted the Kirby Corp, and they seem to have the worst people working of them. neither knows what each are doing and there's no communication. Finally got someone to give me supposedly ""independent"" place where I can take it for service. Went to one, no one was there...seems like its a hole in the wall. Call the corporate again, and told them. They gave me another location...went there, address didn't exist. Call them again, and finally they gave me someone in Southern California by the way, who when I called them, they said I would still have to pay for them to check it out and if its not covered, I would pay still the parts. What a load of #$%$. This company and this machine sucks the big one. Never again will I purchase an overpriced, $1200 dollars by the way, for a vacuum/shampooer. I got suckered. I'm writing this so that you never do. Its best to buy one that is around $200 to $300...if anything does happen, well, at least you didn't pay $1200 and you could buy another one, 2 x's over."
Just expensive vacuums.
