$SENS is by far a better product than others. The marketing push starting Now by Ascensia will get a few on board and word of mouth will spread this product amongst the diabetic community.Exponential growth just like $DXCM is possible once this game changing product hits the streets. With Ascencia and more and more Medical Insurance providers getting on board - $SENS is set up to infiltrate!Generational Wealth! Go long! Good luck!
Where are all the SENS pumpers today
DexCom is up 4.98% to 598.70
"As I predicted 3 days ago, another earnings that crushed estimates and we’re down $10. $600 is right around the corner."
LMAO!!!! I rarely check in here but when I do I know I'll always see the desperate little sens bag holders who get their stock/gambling advice from wallstreetbets.SUCKKAAAS
Once sens 180 is approved Dexcom will Fall back to 300.00 a share or less !
"$SENS must be such disruptive Game changer VERY soonest in all Diabetes business sectors, in which I find it shall dominate and TOP-lead this industry exactly just like Apple  who had killed Blackberry completely to date. $SENS($3.40) vs$DXCM ($550.00) : Guess WHAT will happen!180-days FDA approval is just around corner, and accordingly, please kindly be prepared for your on time boarding without hesitation !!!

"Hey thanks, this example is just like tesla and Nio when comparing technologies, innovation, battery swapping, pricing of the cars and home-field Advantage,￼Nio actually beats Tesla￼￼ but you would never know it by the price difference, wish I had a really good explanation but I do not￼"
Quentin Blackford COO leaving this Friday!! Leaving a lot of options on the table. Fired? Eased out? Implications for G-7 launch and progress? No one person that important. Probably a buying opportunity.

"Several years ago I watched a documentary about a family that went on an ocean cruise with their teenage son who had juvenile diabetes.Well, when he swam in the pool that had ocean saltwater (as opposed to the regular pool) he was fine & needed no insulin shots for the rest of the cruise.So it seems that a person could put the same percent of salt in the bathtub and not need injections every day.Have any of you heard of this before? I'd like to know."
""" No Doubt"" that $SENS shall dominate this Diabetes markets soonest even by 180-days FDA Approval device while $DXCM currently has only 10 to 14 days! And, the FDA approval is just around corner!!! Please be prepared for it in advance!!! And further,in case $SENS has 365-day Device by FDA approval by early 2023 or a bit earlier(end 2022), it is to be 100% second to none products in this Diabetes business markets, and it is Game Over!

"$SENS: Don't make it complicated. The Diabetes care market in the U.S alone is in the billions,and Ascensia is the battering ram we're gonna use to knock the gates down. I'm not selling this share until at least $300.00 a share as one of my bucket lists as I have already kept all investors at $SENS reported of it. The competition $DXCM is usually sitting at around $560.00 levels. Most of Diabetics proves $SENS is much better than $DXCM and others in terms of the unique Diabetes management systems and such high levels of # quality in Accuracy!!! Strong Buy and Hold tight.Glta"
"Just so everyone knows, “Thanks” is a bot"
PE and PEG suggest that expectations of good results had already been priced in. Good stock to have bought a year ago...

"Okay I never speculate on stuff like this but if Dexcom keeps this trend, at what point will this stock split?"
"i did look at that youtube video and i a few things made me recoil about sens:- after you just got cut up for an implant, you still have to fingerstick twice a day to calibrate for a couple weeks, then...- you still have to fingerstick once a day after that. only after a 365 day device has been dreamed up, do they envision a once-a-week fingerstick calibration- sens is much more inaccurate at the beginning of the implant than DXCM and only marginally better near the tail end of the implant's life.- DXCM comes calibrated from the factory.- on top of being cut up for an implant, you still have to wear a transmitter gateway to communicate with yet another external device. - implants are not making it to 180 days; what happens then? ask them to mail you another one? go a couple days/weeks with finger sticks, ... oh, you're already doing that..."

The next earning report is Thursday.... Any predictions for DXCM?
"Informal survey: thumbs up if you are diabetic and plan to switch from DXCM to Eversense 180-days once it is FDA-approved. If you do not plan to switch, plz comment why not. Thnx. (Disclosure: I am long SENS and wld like your thoughts because few diabetics are using currently 90-days, and am thinking that the 180-day Eversense should make a difference.)"
DexCom reached an all time high at 585.04
Citigroup raises PT from $530 to $630 
How does this have a p/e over 200 based on last quarter earnings?
Probably down today after Quentin Blackford COO announcement of leaving effective Friday. It will bounce back
Great day for DXCM and it’s another gorgeous day in San Diego Staying Long
Dexcom having more than half of million people complained about new G6 product for not accurate. Fda has received millions of a case and will review about these issues soon
If you believe a single word this thanks character says - You deserve to lose every dime of your investments. I've been with Dexcom since it was $38 a share. Absolutely checking every day for information from the FDA on the G7. G7 release will be like the second stage of a rocket flight.
