dxcm...strong moves...buy and hold...
"2300 calls and only 1000 puts....going into earnings. I don't know if anybody else has noticed that TNDM and DXCM have been trading ""in-tandem""....so that means a 6-8 dollar pop..I'll be selling first thing in the morning. GLTA"
Quentin Blackford COO leaving this Friday!! Leaving a lot of options on the table. Fired? Eased out? Implications for G-7 launch and progress? No one person that important. Probably a buying opportunity.
Tomorrow's DXCM presentation at Wells Fargo Conference at 2PM EST will be followed by Monday's presentation at Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference also at 2PM EST. Expect some more subtle disclosures about G-7 software additional functions. Do not expect any specifics on G-7 formal release in less than 100 days. AZ automated G-7 plants running multiple shifts for several months now. Maybe we see $600 before the G7 intro day?
"G6 causing many problems, defective sensors, inferior products for Medicare customers, skin rash for tens of thousands, etc. Why does the stock keep going up?? Reason: only game in town. SENS is not viable for so many, but could see a halt in DXCM distribution unless the many problems are corrected. I bet FDA exploring the large number of defective sensors and skin rash complaints. When it works it is great but too many missteps and no good fix."
"Some more insight, found this post:So I have been seeing a lot of posts comparing how the sensor is inserted vs competitors, the adhesive issue, etc. what follows is my personal experience. I am a current user of the Dexcom G6. I have been on this model for about two years.Full disclosure- I also own SENS stock.I think there are a lot of things a lot of non-diabetics generalize. With the Dexcom the sensor attaches to your body and is inserted via needle like apparatus. The Dexcom transmitter attaches to the sensor.The Dexcom G6 transmitter is only good for 90 days. The sensors 10 days.First, the adhesive issue. With Dexcom I have had one adhesive issue. It burned like hell and left a mark that stayed for two weeks. You are right to think that the eversense can do the same but there is a difference. The Dexcom sensor is outside of my body. I didn’t remove the Dexcom sensor for two days because I had no replacement. By the end, the pain went from just waking me up at night to not being able to move my arm. I didn’t know about the adhesive issues and thought the extreme burning was because I somehow bent the sensor inside my arm.When I removed the sensor I went for 5 days with no sensor... I have not used the Eversence but I probably would not of hesitated to remove the adhesive and let the site cool down immediately. So on this one, the idea that I can pull it off and still have a functioning sensor is something I like. In short the eversense transmitter is the only thing on the arm.There is the idea that the Dexcom and libre already are the best.... For one, I am decently active. I didn’t not get a cgm until a couple of years ago. Mainly because I felt they would get in the way and be a potential danger. I have accidentally ripped 3 off my stomach and 2 from my arms. Each time. The complete cost wAs mine. I could not reuse the sensor after removal and my insurance does not cover for the early removal.On this front think of kids. Each time a sensor gets ripped out you are down min. $300 in the U.S.The next thing is not so much an issue since I do not listen to Dexcom or the fda. The Dexcom is only approved to be used on the stomach. A lot of people do not put it there, but that is the only site the fda approved it for. The stomach is the only site Dexcom offers support for.There is concern about the reduced healing capability of diabetics, personally I discount that because I manage my levels well. For kids, I think the eversense makes a lot of sense because of the accidental removal. For Me. I am thinking hard about the 6 month. I already have bi-annual dr appointment.This will not be the best solution for everyone. But, I think there might be more consumers that will benefit from the eversense solution in the long run... which is why I have a position on this.I would like to wear both solutions and get a comparison of pros/cons on day to day use. But, at this point my opinion is that what SENS is developing will have a positive effect on the diabetic community, and in turn the valuation of SENS will increase.$DXCM $SENS"
I recently heard about this company and bought into it. late to the game admittedly yet have great gains to show in a few months. long DXCM
"A short-seller firm, with just $25M under management -- that's million, not BILLION -- puts out a strong sell on a firm.. Apparently it is based on the potential size of the diabetes market. The same tactic was just used on Inogen, maker of oxygen devices for people with breathing difficulties. The net effect is to deprive people of devices that can improve their quality of life and health. Oh well, there's money to be made by short selling."
Best opportunity in several years to buy DXCM- analyst too conservative and too short term focused on G7 delay. Did you know the FDA may have delayed for 90 days all diabetes reviews to focus on covid diagnostics.? Maybe THAT is what hit DXCM stock in October and November? Merrill triples DXM portfolio allocation this morning. Merrill Analyst starts with $500 target.
"Third Quarter 2020 Financial Highlights:Revenue grew 26% versus the same quarter of the prior year to $500.9 millionU.S. revenue growth of 29% and international revenue growth of 17%GAAP operating income of $94.1 million or 18.8% of revenue, an increase of 470 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP operating income* of $95.0 million or 19.0% of revenue, an increase of 410 basis points over the same quarter of the prior year"
DXCM is the only game in town. SENS posters r a riot. Clueless is being kind.
"CAN you please leave your comments or notes here on WHICH stock between $SENS $3.50 and $DXCM $580.00 is much more Expandable, much more Explosive,and more Lucrative for Your investments? I know YOU must be in the same boat that most of Diabetics are currently confirming,proving,and stressing that $SENS is much better than any other Competitions like DXCM in the sense of ""THE Unique and Unprecedented Diabetes management systems(Implantable) for longs and its demonstrated & already proven #1 quality levels of Accuracy in the Diabetes device markets,#1 Cost-effective solutions provider plus #1 innovative and adaptive freedom activities provider like ""swimming"" & ""heavy sweating"" further while 180-days FDA approval is just around corner and further WHILE this product is currently on TV advertisements in Europe and Sales and Marketing by Ascensia just started in USA since.April.1.2021, and further WHILE that the Competitions are just sitting around only a 10 to 14 days. In this regard, I believe $SENS must be next $DXCM with no doubts.And, Super Strong Buy and Hold tight and please do NOT give any single share of yours to any Shorters per ""FREE OF CHARGE "" and sell it when YOU are fully satisfied! Glta Very Sincerely "

Market cap on C is $143 billion and the company is trading @$70 a share . What make you think DXCM with a $50. Billion should be trading @ $540.00? Over priced !
"DXCM G6 usage for patient monitoring under new emergency guidelines in Canada. The nursing staff will never go back to the old ""patrol the beds hourly"" routine when G6 can monitor, alert and notify the staff as to patient status."
$SENS is by far a better product than others. The marketing push starting this WEEK will get a few on board and word of mouth will spread this product amongst the diabetic community.Exponential growth just like $DXCM is possible once this game changing product hits the streets. With Ascencia and more and more Medical Insurance providers getting on board - $SENS is set up to infiltrate!Generational Wealth! Go long! Good luck!
"I saw that JPMorgan remains bullish on DXCM and has a $175 price target. Here's an excerpt from the research report as reported by TheFly...""The latest DexCom (DXCM) controversy is ""whirling speculation"" around Abbott's (ABT) Libre 2.0 launch, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on DexCom shares with a $175 price target but expects uncertainty over Libre 2.0 to remain an overhang until it receives U.S. approval. However, he remains ""very bullish"" on the shares and sees ""significant upside"" to 2019 estimates. DexComis the best positioned in diabetes longer-term, Marcus contends."""
”G7 is 30% smaller than libre” according to todays presentation at Canaccord Genuity's 39th Annual Growth Conference.
$SENS is going to the MOON! NEARLY 103 million shares short180-day CGM SYSTEM SHOW STRONG ACCURACYFDA APPROVAL SOON (2-3 months)DXCM priced at $400 a share is our closest competitor!!!Coverage on CNBC today!CGM device is way more accurate then $DXCM and other competitors!
Anyone else seeing all the advertising time Dexcom has had on CNN and CNBC lately? I think I'v seen more Dexcom commercials in the past week than I have in the past 2 years total.
I'm listening to a podcast with Mr. Sayer discussing next generation product G7. He said the design makes it possible for production of tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of units in a repeatable manner. From Diabetes Connections Podcast. And production of G7 is completely automated. Both seem pretty significant.

"$SENS Senseonics the NEXT BNGOSenseonics is a medical device startup company in USA developing transformative glucose monitoring products that are intended to enable people with diabetes to confidently live their lives with ease. Utilizing breakthrough fluorescence sensing technology, the Senseonics continuous glucose monitoring (""CGM"") system is being designed to be the first fully implantable CGM that is highly accurate and stable throughout its long sensor life.

"Given the impact of Spruce Point Capital's (free) research on DXCM, I decided to check in on the report they did for Carvana (CVNA) dated a month ago (updated 3/1/2019). Spruce Point saw a 50-70% downside minimum. In the time since their report, the stock has risen 43% to around $62 where it's hovering today. I wouldn't invest in CVNA myself, but it is interesting to see how the stories play out once the manipulators ""sell"" their research. Hang in there."
We believe there are folks wearing G7 out and about as part of company's field testing. Inevitable that more details will leak out. Will duration and data collection exceed current expectations? When the limited release begins later this year we would not be surprised to see DXCM over $300.Will pricing and pricing expectations with full release in 2021 open up the HUGE opportunity to use G7 or G8 variation as insulin monitoring and other metrics as disposable monitor for pregneant women and in hospital and nursing and nursing homes. THAT eventuality could take DXCM over $400 going into 2022?
Any opinion on what will happen to stock price tomorrow after earnings announced
"What DXCM does to a diabetics skin is awful!!! Big red blotches, followed by scaling, takes 3-4 weeks to return to normal, so a DXCM user must endure a very messy situation. DXCM is a monopoly I does not care about it's customers.SENS--what diabetic wants something implanted under the skin?? It cannot be the norm. FreeLibre--it cannot transmit the readings to your cell phone. No communication feature so impractical. Medtronic--I am currently researching this and might try it. Does not accept Medicare.My stomach is a real mess, so I think the stock tanks once a real competitor emerges."
""" No Doubt"" that $SENS shall dominate this Diabetes markets soonest even by 180-days FDA Approval device while $DXCM currently has only 10 to 14 days! And, the FDA approval is just around corner!!! Please be prepared for it in advance!!! And further,in case $SENS has 365-day Device by FDA approval by early 2023 or a bit earlier(end 2022), it is to be 100% second to none products in this Diabetes business markets, and it is Game Over! "
"DXCM guidance for 2020 revenue is approx $1.75b. They will exceed that by AT LEAST $150m and I'm being conservative. $2 billion would not be out of the question. I'll get a ton of laughs over this and plenty of thumbs down but trust me, I'm right. $500-$550/share by the first quarter 2021 is the low end of what I expect and $600 would not surprise me. GLTA and sorry shorts."
"Abt didnt release news about icgm during ada. They will do it later this year, but market starts to realize that the spruce point report wasnt very correct in general."
"Buying more here on this pullback due to Texas Governor asking hospitals to restrict elective surgery to make room for surging Covid patient volume. Silly market over reaction since DXCM not tied to hospital .visits!! DXCM building new G7 units in large volume at AZ facilities in preparation for G7 global introduction in Q4. Stock upside to $600 in 2022. as Buffet says ""be greedy when other are fearful"""

"$SENS : Remember your always buying a stock in a company on its value 1 year out,.. so not far from 2023, with the 365 day patch .. which is .,and will be a game changer no doubt ..when you start seeing market share being taken away from $DXCM, then you know $SENS is winning. It will be late then to invest.I am very small investor here,and I am planning to keep it till $100.00 first stop, and then $300.00 as a second stop,and more as one of my bucket lists in my life in which I find it will NOT take that long, and I am also planning to make my wife a bit surprised gift when I am out of this stock in future. I should say THIS must be real GEM and Gold mine!Good Lucks to All investors here at $SENS!"
Dexcom is maxed out near its 52 week high with nothing more to offer to the market except changing the model# what goes up must come down (Isaac Newton)
Lol. This board has been taken over by clearly paid pumpers for another stock. Congratulations the other stock people!
"DXCM had a good run-up. It has to digest the HUGE gains before another move up. One should expect it to be flat (this is flat for DXCM, BTW) for 4-6 weeks in between run-ups. Play with the chart to see the pattern. As long quarterly earnings do not disappoint, that will be the pattern."
"Buying SENS shares @3,20 is a no brainer compared to DEXCOM shares @ 511.00"
"Three Deciding Factors : The 3 deciding factors that convinced me to keep holding this share. Before you sell for a small profit, read this through, and I hope you share the same vision as me and not miss out on a chance of a lifetime to be wealthy and earn over 100 times more than chump change. A good business consists of 3 elements and that is 1)Good product, 2)Prices, and 3)A dream team, so let's start. Product - This sensor is the ONLY patented sensor on the market that lasts this long by FDA180 days device which shall be fully enough for Diabetes patients to use while the competition $DXCM has only a 10 to 14 days device now while $SENS FDA 180 days device is just around corner( literally any time from now), and Diabetics already proves it is much better than the competitions like $DXCM's device in the sense of unique and unprecedented Diabetes management and its accuracy,and in addition, with the coming FDA 365 days device in around end 2022 year or early 2023 year, we can all agree it will disrupt this entire Diabetes business sector completely in favors of $SENS!!!Its quality is already proven by superior levels of accuracy and unprecedented Diabetes management system !!! Price - As soon as more insurance sees the benefit of the low cost overall, they will 100% add this to their plans and its competition,$DXCM'S current share is sitting at around $500.00 a share while $SENS is just sitting around  $4.00 and $SENS is to arrive at $100.00 a share very soon per step by step together with drastic market increases in views of its quality proven in such #1 accuracy.Team - Ascensia(Exclusive distribution agreement to $SENS) are in 125 countries specializing in diabetes with over 10 millions patients and will be doing their best to convert their old and new customer to use this is a win/win for everyone!!! GLTA"
"This current market has completely exposed the inner workings of the market and it's driving forces: DXCM gained $50 just because it beat earnings.... with the ""news"" being DXCM's tech is out-dated. This game will continue until the FDA approves SENS' 180-day device (that has already proven successful in its trials), which is being delayed because of COVID. I hope retail investors here understand the hedge funds roll in this with their newly implemented aggressive market-wide psychological tactics. Believe what you want, but the big-boys on top know what the future has in store here - convince DXCM investors (probably even institutions as well) they have a good investment by driving the price up enough to bring in more purchases of shares/call-options, and simultaneously convince SENS investors they made a bad investment by driving the price down. When SENS' FDA approval comes through, watch what this does.....Lesson to be learned: when two stocks are each other's competitor, do your DD on both from a NEUTRAL stand-point. Honestly, good luck here in the near future; this is reaching it's peak before it's descend."
Rumor is that the next Apple Watch will have blood sugar monitoring capability. Has anyone evaluated how that may affect DXCM?
"Congratulations to DXCM. I wear it for 2 years.....the technology is wonderful and a real game changer, but us DXCM users have loads of troubles with reliability and customer service. A true competitor does not exist today, but if a formidable one came along, this stock price could drop again to $400. Today they have a monopoly, but what does tomorrow bring??"
"All eyes on December 8 analyst day meeting.JPMorgan analyst thinks one should take advantage of this sell off.. ""With G7 on track, great margins, solid 40% volume growth, and record new patient adds in 3Q, we think the sell-off is excessive and would recommend buying here. The G7 US approval trial has already begun – we’ve confirmed this with management. Postings toclinicaltrials.gov don’t always precede the trial starting, and yes, the US approval trial has already started. We know there was significant speculation of a delay heading into earnings, so this is an important point."""
"WOW GREAT EARNINGS with Upward revisions to YE on all areas, great job DXCM!"
"both DXCM and SENS have very good products and they are quite different. My understanding is the patients do need both based on their lifestyle and situation. If SENS can continually improve its product it does pose a threat to DXCM. I think DXCM should buy out SENS, hostile takeover to make sure its leading position, once that happened, DXCM will be a better investment for coming many years."
"Informal survey: thumbs up if you are diabetic and plan to switch from DXCM to Eversense 180-days once it is FDA-approved. If you do not plan to switch, plz comment why not. Thnx. (Disclosure: I am long SENS and wld like your thoughts because few diabetics are using currently 90-days, and am thinking that the 180-day Eversense should make a difference.)"
"For a patient it is strange and highly counter-intuitive that an insulin-pump company (TNDM) trades at a higher multiple than a CGM company (DXCM). From my perspective, DXCM is a company that, admittedly for a limited population (DT1 patients), has changed lives. You can consider the i-phone, the i-pad, facebook, or google as life changing products or services, but for me, as a patient, Dexcom and its CGM rank today, and probably until my last day (unless a cure is found) as the most impactful innovation during my life time. It will take some time for insurance companies to understand that fully covering Dexcom CGM for DT1 patient is the most intelligent way of handling DT1 patients whole life healthcare costs. DXCM needs to follow not only the improved health profile of its adopters, but also their associated health costs during a decade or two. Once such data are available, it will be apparent to healthcare insurance companies that a CGM should be assumed as the standard of care and I believe growth for the company will be essentially unlimited. My 2 cents."

As a parent of a Type 1 diabetic whos A1C is well managed this quarters blowout earnings came as no surprise. I think they have many years of large growth ahead of them. It doesn't take much research to find out how their users feel about the product. I love the G6 and can't wait for the G7. Cheers to all the longs and a big thank you and congratulations to the people of DXCM for making so many lives infinitely better.

Down over 100. Same innovative product with huge benefits to diabetic patients and huge future opportunities. People were clamoring to buy at $300 and now freaking out and turning away at $200. Perfect demonstration of buying high and selling low and perfect demonstration of bad investor behavior from those who invest through momentum and emotions.
Less than 100 days to G-7 release? $600

The marketing push starting Now by Ascensia will get a few on board and word of mouth will spread this product amongst the diabetic community.Exponential growth just like $DXCM is possible once this game changing product hits the streets.

"ABT has a CGM system that doubled sales in 2018 .to $1 billion.This is going to $300 - 400 range .DXCM has much better system and expect a good 2018 and huge 2019,2020 .CGM's are catching up like never before.If ABT is smart enough they should buy DXCM just to take out competition for a huge market."
"Kevin Sayer (DEXCOM CEO) spoke on the Q4 conference call about the improvements in manufacturing from the G5 to the G6, and now from the G6 to the G7 with the transmitter being integrated into the sensor. I feel like when the entire unit is disposable and its a pharmacy item there are going to be millions more people using their products. Huge markets in countries with Unniversal health care like the UK where they don't just give a CGM to every diabetic but many people purchase them on their own. The outcomes are so good using a CGM that it's easy to make the case that they save insurance companies money by preventing more costly conditions that come from not managing your blood sugar. Cost is the only benefit that any other CGM has over the Dexcom system and that is an area I expect them to improve upon when the G7 is released. In my opinion Dexcom has just started a new phase of their growth. For anyone asking if they are too late in discovering DXCM I would ask them to look at APPLE, AMAZON, TESLA, ETC. At what point in their growth story would you say you missed the opportunity and wouldn't want to buy if you could go back in time a year? I have DXCM in my ROTH that my children will likely inherit. That's how I feel about DXCM today."
Another great quarter from Dexcom!Been here since the low 100s. Am a T1 myself since 30 years back.

"Louis Navellier in his newsletter for this week called DEXCom a great stock to own. He stated today in his newsletter:Ask Louis: DexCom, Inc. (DXCM)In the past few weeks, I’ve received several questions about DexCom, Inc. (DXCM). Most subscribers are concerned with the stock’s more than 20% decline from its mid-March highs. So, let’s take a closer look at DexCom today.If you recall, DexCom has revolutionized the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) industry. CGM is the technology that enables patients and their doctors to better manage diabetes. DexCom’s technology allows a patient to insert a small sensor under the skin to monitor glucose levels, rather than constantly pricking a finger to test blood glucose levels.With the current CGM market including about six million people and expected to expand to 60 million people, DexCom’s products are growing in demand. As a result, the company is growing into a more profitable company.In fact, in the fourth quarter, DexCom reported that earnings surged 304% year-over-year to $48.9 million, or $0.54 per share, up from $12.1 million, or $0.14 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The analyst community was expecting earnings of $0.17 per share, so DXCM posted a whopping 217.6% earnings surprise.Considering these stunning fourth-quarter results, it’s a bit confusing as to why the stock pulled back sharply in March. The reality is that investors overreacted to President Trump’s support for eliminating Obamacare—and that’s what caused the recent decline in most healthcare and medical stocks, like DexCom.However, the company’s future is bright. For the first quarter, which will be announced on May 1, the analyst community is expecting an earnings per share loss of $0.16 and revenue of $246.9 million, which is up from a $0.32 per share loss and $184.4 million in revenue in the same quarter a year ago. So, that represents 33.9% annual revenue growth and 50% annual earnings growth.I should also add that analysts have increased their earnings per share estimates over the past three months. And DexCom has a history of positive earnings surprises, posting an average 133% earnings surprise in the past four quarters. So, I’m expecting another solid report from DXCM on May 1.In the meantime, DXCM remains a good buy below $14"

DXCM management presenting at 2PM EST today at Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference.Getting closer to G-7 introduction within 100 days? $600 as we go into next year IMHO
This latest run up in the stock price disproves what all these SENS spammers are claiming: if SENS truly had a better mousetrap DXCM should’ve fallen back to the 200s or lower. Glad I ignored all the noise of the bears. DXCM still very relevant and will be for a very long time.
I am using Dexcom for T2 for last 6 months and love the product . Wanted to buy the stock entering now is very risky —- any inputs ??
Once sens 180 is approved Dexcom will Fall back to 300.00 a share or less !
"what I got out of yesterday's conference call.- More than happy with guidance given at end of Q3- Dexcom directly plays into remote medicine with connected products- if anything, diabetics and other disproportionately affected patients bring more awareness to having your blood sugar monitored- don't see any rumors or talk that would have affected SP after Q3 call- attribute softness to awkwardly released 8K- G7: on schedule data to share May- will target G7 to several target patient types- 10 day vs. 15 day: 10 day first, sensors work to 15, but longer trial needed for 15 day. 94% of sensors work to 10 days and they won't release anything unless numbers at least this good for 15 day sensor (see nonverbal reactions at 10:43, the uncomfortable shifting in chairs and scratching of ears) my opinion: there's no 15 day yet.- pharmacy migration successful, ongoing- record patient add Q3, expecting good results in the future - a little bit of badmouthing Abbott: sensor performance ""underwhelming"", 1 minute reporting is ""smoke and mirrors"": there's only so much data you can get out of interpolating 15 minute raw numbers. Dexcom does provide 5 minute raw data and accurate algorithms for predictive warnings within 20 minutes. - Abbott to have a true CGM mid next year, Dexcom not worried: all comes down to sensor performance. I'm not familiar with story but they mention ""look at Medtronics"" (?)Seemed like a solid call, will have more details to share Dec 9th. As long as they stay the best in sensor performance, I can only see more Dexcom adoption."
"DXCM may very well maybe overpriced and due to correct. SENS wishes it had a similar issue . It just won't work vs DXCM. Its only advantage is actually a disadvantage. If there is an issue with the sensor need to go to dr vs just replacing the g6, You actually have to go to a DR and require a 24 hour calibration which will require quite a bit of finger sticks.DXCM is as easy as pie to change every 10 day . Customer service is awesome . It took Ascensis rep 4 days to return my call when I discovered they had NO closed loop system plan which is clearly the next step in diabetes care not a 180 day sensor. If you blood sugar is trending higher the pump will administer insulin/bolus and if going low it will either lessen or stop the basal Any diabetic will agree with me regarding the closed loop system aka artificial pancreas. ."
"Dexcom's customer service has gone down hill fast this year. Not able to get someone to answer support lines, orders don't ship for unknown reasons. Orders held up for weeks because they can't bother to let me know they have an expired card on file. They leave call back messages for phone numbers that don't work. Asked for a manager to let them know and they have no escalation process. Been a customer for years, now looking for an alternative. Oh.. and by the way the new G6 is not as accurate as the G5 was for me."
dexcom is the market leader but is having pressure from the Freestyle CGM. SENS you need to have a minor medical procure to have device inserted which many people might not like. others will be happy cause they domt have to insert and stick themselves every 10 to 14 days.does anybody think that since Dexcom established Venture Capital today they could be looking to add SENS to their portfolio and buy them out?
"I asked all my professional, 35 years experience traders, friends and no one can explain why it’s no going up. Any theories yet?"
"The last time Decom had a massive drop it was due to the market misunderstanding Abbot's competitive product which still had not been approved for kids. Once market caught up, the price went up again. If this is reallly due to Trump cap on insulin, it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of Dexcom as a product"
"Global Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Market size is expected to reach USD 13360 million by 2026, from USD 12590 million in 2020. SENS could be a 5B company soon."
"VERY positive new stock recommendation on well followed growth stock service Motley Fool:They just require the user to prick a finger to get a drop of blood and then read a strip in a portable device. But what if patients simply knew their glucose level at all times, without the need to stop, get blood, and take a measurement?That's only become possible relatively recently, and this month's recommendation, DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM), is the pioneer. It introduced the first real-time glucose monitoring system in 2006, but it has really been since 2012, when the company launched its G4 Platinum device, that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has started to catch on as a feasible tool for many patients. We think that diabetes care — and potentially even prediabetes care — will inevitably move toward these systems, much the way convenience made test strips a mainstay of disease management. That points to an incredible future for DexCom.The Big-Picture OpportunityIt's likely that diabetes has touched your life in some way. More than 30 million Americans have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), including more than 12% of the adult population. Factor in prediabetes, and the figure is greater than 100 million. The vast majority of these patients have type 2 diabetes, which doesn't necessarily require insulin at first but often advances until insulin is needed. It certainly requires careful glucose control through diet, exercise, and other medications. Type 1 diabetes, meanwhile, represents less than 10% of diabetes cases but develops in childhood and requires lifelong daily insulin.Worldwide, the number of people with diabetes has quadrupled since 1980 and is expected to reach 700 million by 2045. The cost is crushing, with a total annual economic burden of $327 billion just in the U.S., according to the ADA. And the reason for the expense is not primarily the medicines and supplies used to manage the disease (only about 15% of the cost) but rather hospitalization and treatment of complications. Better managing the disease day to day is in the interest of patients, insurers, governments, and everyone else.That's why DexCom's CGM has been so eagerly embraced by patients and payers alike. By alerting patients to shifts in blood sugar, the devices can help them make better decisions about what and when to eat or how to optimize insulin intake. Since the 2012 launch of the G4 Platinum, sales have grown at a compound annual pace of 47%, reaching nearly $1.5 billion in 2019. Although the company just turned profitable last year, we expect profits and cash flow to climb quickly as it continues to see strong uptake of the current and future CGMs. Talk about how DXCM fits into SA hereRisk Rating - coming soon!See how you can tell if this investment is going right — or wrong.DexCom certainly doesn't make the only CGM, but it has consistently had the most advanced, best-reviewed, and (anecdotally) best-loved devices. The G4 Platinum is still for sale, but it has been augmented by the G5 Mobile and G6 devices. While most CGMs require multiple fingerstick blood samples a day for calibration, the G6, launched in June 2018, does not. That's perhaps why management has reported that sales have far surpassed its expectations, making the company struggle to keep up with demand.CGMs are relatively complex, consisting of the receiver device that patients use to read results (although this can also be done with a smartphone) as well as a sensor and a transmitter that must be regularly replaced. You might say this is a razor-and-blade model, except that it's essentially all blade. This represents an ongoing revenue stream for the company.It's also fairly expensive. Sensors last about 10 days and cost about $400 for a pack of three. A transmitter lasts about three months and costs about $350. Luckily, insurance typically covers much of this expense for many patients.But this should improve with the launch of the G7, which is expected around the end of the year. A joint project with Verily, the life sciences arm of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the G7 will be cheaper and more streamlined and will have sensors that last 14 to 15 days (instead of 10 for the G6). That should open up this technology to more people.Why We Trust LeadershipPresident, chairman, and CEO Kevin Sayer has led the company since 2015 and has overseen much of the company's recent upward trajectory, including the launches of the G5 and G6. In fact, he has been with the company since 2011, before the launch of the G4 Platinum that redefined the CGM space. Along with that, Sayer has shifted the company's focus from physicians to consumers, which we believe is responsible for much of the company's success in keeping up with the usability features that make the G6 so well regarded."

I had a patient who was a type 1 diabetic using DXCM for 2-3 months. Her A1c was 5.4. Pretty unbelievable.
"Based on the testimonials, this is the best medical product of the 21st century. Major success in managing diabetes."
I used an insulin pump for years but now just Dexcom’s CGM and insulin pens. It’s my takeaway that people don’t want multiple devices attached to themselves.

"If interested, I will be providing information from a public event currently in progress (virtually) in Columbus Ohio today by the ADCES entitled ""a blueprint for change: the future of diabetes education"". You had to have paid and registered previously to attend this, but it is by no means ""insider info"". More specifically, at 1:15pm there is going to be a compare and contrast session of a number of CGM systems. There is no list of specific devices on the agenda, but I will provide the low-down whether DXCM is a part of the mix or not."
"I obviously do not know whether Dexcom is worth $50, $100, or $300 per share. But I can tell you that if you had the chance to talk to a doctor specialized in diabetes, as I do every 3 months, what you will hear is: ""Dexcom and Tandem have changed the way we practice medicine for diabetics"". The closed loop between Tandem's tslim pump and Dexcom G6 is the golden standard of the industry. Other competitors can certainly catch up, but switching patients is easier said than done."
FDA approval for $SENS could happen any time and is expected to be approved by October 15. or years end.Here is some due diligence on Senseonics!https://woodlandreport.com/2021/08/senseonics-sens-path-to-glory-and-its-potential-to-secure-dominance-and-revolutionize-diabetes-care/$DXCM
"DXCM beats estimates, raises guidance, but down 1.3% in early trading. Is it jump out time? Looking to enter this"
"I expect a phenomenal earnings report on April 28, 2020 after hours!!!"
"In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 25 cents per share for DXCM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DXCM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +139.12% heading into earnings season."
"I've acquired a fairly large stake over the past week. The diabetes treatment companies are a great space. Diabetes affects a larger population every year, and these products are revolutionary. I'll ride both $DXCM and $ABT over the long term and i'm confident I won't regret it. This space laughs at the trade war and economic slowdowns also."
"The recent decline is hilarious. Goes to show how much Analysts DON'T know about DXCM. DXCM's strategic discussions are focused on 5X'ing their current revenue level. Even with their shoddy distribution & logistics operations, they've been blowing estimates out of the water. Don't believe me? call their customer service line. You will wait at least 45 to 90 min just to get to speak to an agent. It's not because they have a bad CS department. It's simply because they are constantly overwhelmed with elevated demand. Plus, Libre is at least 2 - 3 years behind DXCM's technology. No one here talk about how it took Abbott 3+ years get to the same MARD rate as DXCM. For those of you who don't know what MARD is... it's essentially the accuracy of reading. Come Oct 27, this is going to be up at $500 because Analysts still haven't figured out that DXCM's projections have consistently been based on worst-case-scenario. Oct 27 will be no different. DXCM will destroy the estimates and it will shoot up 15 - 20% like it has done in the past... Wells Fargo's downgrade was the best thing that happened to folks who were waiting on the sideline. This puppy is going to be playing in the 500+ club after earning release. I'd get in now while you still can."
"Buying on the dip. This is too good of an opportunity to pass up. This stock will take out $500 in the next 2 years, maybe $600. Their products are too necessary for this to be a permanent rotation. Buying all the dips and getting rich along the way."
$SENS is to be SENSational and everlasting in Stock history at Wallstreet in terms of providing such freedom activities to current Diabetes patients with no objections!!! Wow~! $SENS Nation is coming to You by her killing $DXCM markets softly!!!
DXCM will be at 600 while SENS gets FDA 180 day approval and adds 3 customers. All non diabetic SENS longs doing their best to get the total customer base over 1000 before 2028 when the 276 day sensor gets FDA approval . The 180 day FDA approval will be a bigger non event than 90 day approval which continues to add a customer every other leap year. DXCM rocks.

Solid buying opportunity.
Congratulations to all DXCM investors. Hopefully TNDM will follow suite. They are paired wonderfully and the best in the market.
Very strong q4 and 2020 preliminary results announced this morning. Some analysts will focus on early 2020 growth of 17-20% being lower than 2019. If stock pulls back this is huge opportunity to add to holdings BEFORE G7 becomes more visible later in the year. Targets can go up to over $300 for next 12-15 months.

I’m new to investing and a 24 yr uncontroled diabetic icu nurse. Guess what my 1st stock purchase is :)

$DXCM trading with a PE of 90 and a market cap of 44.885B. The projected growth in this arena is massive. $SENS is positioned perfectly to tap into that potential.

Everyone posting hear about SENS and Dexcom is done I find quite humerus. Go post on that board and stop posting about SENS here. Fly shoe fly
"DXCM is the best thing ever for diabetics, I laugh when imposters post nonsense about G6. SENS is NOT working on closed loop system as DXCM is. The morons who are long SENS are pumping the prospect of 180 day implant when nobody bought the 90 day. In my mind changing your sensor every 10 days at home is better than visiting a dr every 3 or 6 months to get the implant which still requires the transmitter be worn on top of the skin..SENS is destined to fail yet the pumpers can't see the forest through the barren SENS trees. SENS could easily be bought for short $ if anybody thought they had a viable product. AAPL could buy it as an afterthought. DXCM would buy it if they deemed it a threat but it doesn't even rate as a distraction. If anybody wants a good laugh go visit the SENS board and read the incessant pumping by the SENS minions who can't understand why this company hasn't taken over the world yet."

"Per the balance sheet, the throwing money toward future growth and not caring about net earnings is common to many growth stocks like AMZN and others. Remember, AMZN could have been profitable right after its IPO over 14 years ago. They decided not to care about net earnings and put all monies into future growth. Now they make in one quarter what they posted in earnings over the initial 12 years. DXCM has the 7 coming out, is grabbing a lot of market share and is the premier player in this space."

"i did look at that youtube video and i a few things made me recoil about sens:- after you just got cut up for an implant, you still have to fingerstick twice a day to calibrate for a couple weeks, then...- you still have to fingerstick once a day after that. only after a 365 day device has been dreamed up, do they envision a once-a-week fingerstick calibration- sens is much more inaccurate at the beginning of the implant than DXCM and only marginally better near the tail end of the implant's life.- DXCM comes calibrated from the factory.- on top of being cut up for an implant, you still have to wear a transmitter gateway to communicate with yet another external device. - implants are not making it to 180 days; what happens then? ask them to mail you another one? go a couple days/weeks with finger sticks, ... oh, you're already doing that..."
"I use the freestyle and my son uses the dexcom6. the two products dont compare at all. Dexcom's product, customer service and price is far better on my (expensive) insurance. Don't forget that the weekly supplies have huge profit margins."
"1. Those with higher blood sugar levels, are at higher risk for contracting a variety of infectious diseases. 2. When someone with diabetes gets sick, glucose management becomes harder.Why isn’t this rocket taking off?"
"Right now most insurance companies will only cover Dexcom if the patient is on a fast acting insulin like Humalog or Novolog. If they are only on a basil insulin like Lantus or only oral anti-diabetics they will not cover it. Several Medical Doctors have told me that the compliance and management of their diabetes by Diabetics using a Dexcom system is head and shoulders above and better than by those that rely on doing regular finger sticks. The better management results in less complications, and lower hospital admissions which as a result substantially cuts back on insurance cost. As a result, I have been told that there is now a push for insurance to cover 24 hour glucose monitoring systems like Dexcom for all diabetics and even pre diabetics. If that goes through, sales are going to explode and I think we will very quickly go north of $1000 a share in no time."
During analyst call a great question was asked regarding price... How can you expect people to buy Dexcom when they can't afford insulin? I think they're making the right moves to fix this issue & I am sure the new factory in Malaysia will help. One promising sign is the fact people like myself continue to buy this product even if it stretches there budget. I consider myself quite thrifty but I thought if there's one thing I can't be cheap with it is my health. I hope they continue becoming more integrated with Apple and it remains clear they have the best app/software. Nobody is going to want to use the less user friendly app. Interestingly I see quite a few similarities in the 2 companies. Reminds me of people first buying the Ipad for $500 in 2008. Though they don't still have the tablet monopoly (80% of sales in 2008).. They have kept that same pricing power with just 28% of market today..The question is will Dexcom be able to maintain that premium pricing power? I think so... time will tell. If they do this is still a BUY.

"JPM Morgan analyst after meetings with management raises target to $450 for Dec. this year.""What was new to us is that management expects increased volumes to fullyoffset the ~$50M OUS price headwind in 2021 alone. By our rough math, thiswould mean an incremental 25,000 patients or so in 2021 but, given therecurring revenue of the business and high retention rates, could mean an extra$40M+ in 2022+ revenue vs. prior forecasts.

"Some quotes from customers:“My 19 yr old son has been using Eversense since July 2019. He does not want to go back to dexcom because those sensors fail and fall off way too frequently. I hope Senseonics is able to bring the 6 month & 12 month sensors to the market soon. I’ve spent many hours on the phone with Florida Blue, Carecentrix and US Med trying to get eversense approved & supplies, so I’m so saddened to read of latest setback. I have nothing but good things to say of the eversense sales representatives I’ve worked with.”“It has been just about 24 hours since I had the @eversensecgm removed and replaced. Everything went off without a hitch. I was injected with Lidocaine to numb the area. I felt a slight pinch from the needle going in, but it wasn't too much more than a normal insulin injection. The doctor tested the area with a point to see if I could feel anything. When I said that I did, he just waited longer for the area to numb more.Once the incision was made, the sensor came out easy. There was no pain or feeling when the tool was under my skin. After the sensor was removed, a new sensor was prepped and inserted. Again, I felt no pain. I could still move my arm and fingers because the numbing was only in the small surgical area on the upper arm. Once the doctor was done putting on surgical strips, this cover was applied. I could see some of the blood seeping through, but the bleeding is normal. The transmitter was placed on top until I took it off just now. This is the only blood that came out of this small incision. Many people have turned down the idea of the @eversensecgm because they are scared of the procedure. They think that it is extremely invasive. I'm here to tell you that it is not. All in all, it took 10 minutes from walking into the office to leaving. There was no pain after the lidocaine wore off either.Others don't like the idea of having a sensor under the skin, but it if it's accurate why not use something that has an extended wear option?I'll keep this cover on until it starts to come off. I want to make sure it heals properly.”$SENS $DXCM"

"From TNDM earnings calls today:Alex Nowak -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- AnalystGreat. Good afternoon everyone. Congrats on the great start to the year. John, I just want to ask a question here. There's been a lot of noise out there about your partner Dexcom around Abbott's upcoming Libre 2. Now, we all know you're not directly impacted by this, but just it's kind of a three part question here. One, could you integrate another CGM like Libre 2 to work with your pump? Two, would you actually want to do that or are you happy here remaining a Dexcom only closed-loop system for the next couple of years? And then, three, what would be the lead time here to actually go out, develop a new algorithm, integrate a new CGM and get it FDA approved?John Sheridan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerWell good question. First of all I just want to start off by saying that Dexcom is a great partner of ours and we really appreciate the relationship we have with them. We've integrated three generations of their device and I think that the benefits that we get from Dexcom really have to do with the close relationship our engineering teams have, which brings in enhanced speed to market -- time to market, as well as just a best-in-class system. That being said, we do have a non-exclusive relationship with Dexcom and I have said in the past that if there are other ICGM systems in the market that have appreciable market share, we would definitely consider implementing them on the system.So the things that we've talked a bit about interoperability in the past and the things that you have to consider in doing that are the technology and does the technology actually integrate. And you also need to have business relationships in place as well. I would say at this point in time, we do not know enough about the technology that Abbott is bringing forward to their Libre 2. So that's still an open question. And I think the same thing goes as far as the business relationships as well. I think that the lead time is probably -- it's probably on the order of a year for us to get that done."
Deacom G7 rollout coming first week in December??
"As a user of CGM, in my opinion, the DXCM product has better features and performance than Minimed and Abbott products. I expect future growth to be helped in part by pump users who purchase the TNDM Tslim Control IQ, which is expected to be FDA approved in Q4. TNDM management stated in its Q3 call this week that Tslim sales were ""paused"" in the quarter as pumpers waited for approval of Control IQ which is more advanced than the current Tslim Basal IQ. Many Minimed pumpers prefer the DXCM sensor over Minimed sensors for many reasons (less calibration, longer life and more accurate). The DXCM sensors currently work with TNDM pumps but TNDM does not currently work with Minimed. During the call, CXCM management talked about starting sales in Japan in Q1 2020 and integrating with insulin pens from several manufacturers like Lily. I understand the revenue drivers because of the product benefits, advantages over the competition, and partnerships with numerous insulin delivery partners that leverage sales effort. I believe they have further periods of rapid growth. Also good to hear that they have >$1B cash and are now GAAP profitable. Management did acknowledge growing pains and shut down of a production line late in Q3."
