"Check Google trends and call your local pool retailer, you’ll see that sales are exploding right now."
PE is way too high! This is not a tech company. Wait for it to correct to a reasonable value.
Pool is up 4.93% to 486.70
I never owned it but such a good performer..Congratulations longs ..
Hi all. The cold snap in the south has resulted in millions or more in damage to pool equipment. Parts are sold out in the south. This is a boom to the pool business.
No reason for this right?
Pool reached an all time high at 507.65
I cannot find information about the earnings report was it positive negative or no change
I would no more bet against POOL than I would play a game of Russian roulette. This company is a monster and has made me rich. Fully confident this will see $500 a share in the future.
Goldman upgrades POOL to a buy with a $535 price target...exactly where I believe the company will ultimately trade. When it comes to pools POOL is by far and away the best stock in its industry.
Can anyone explain why the stock did poorly today after crushing earnings numbers. Thank you in advance.
Pool is currently at the same price it was on Oct 12th. This is one of the longer times that Pool has been this flat. Let's hope that they have good numbers to report in two days. GLTA
"Anyone out there following this stock? I think it can go to $300.00 post earnings. An insider told me that sales are through the roof, and supply can barely keep up with demand. Apparantly since regular vacations are out this year, many are buying or upgrading their pools."
"Hey guys, how long are you all staying in this stock. I took it for trade back 1st of April and just curious to know your price target or how long you’re staying. Thanks for the help in advance."
yooo the south is frozen n so are the pumps n pipes .I'm goin long 36 shares tommorow!!! whadda bkut you???? yea you .
"A chlorine shortage is rocket fuel for stocks like POOL. POOL is the best of breed in its industry...excellent financial health, fantastic earnings growth, and in terms of capital returns it has been an absolute monster since 2015. No reason for me to think it won't trade at 500 in the future. I believe everyone should own this fantastic company. All it has done ever since I've owned it is put more and more money in my pocket. I've not only recouped my investment I've made a ton of extra money as well. The soil for this company to continue to grow is as fertile as that of a flood plain."
"Jumped in today at $286, better late than last."
"opinions on this run continuing? hearing pool installers are running g like a year behind with backlog, business is insane...how much good news is priced i. here v room to run still?"
