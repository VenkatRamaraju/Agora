Ugly trading activity in POOL for last 2 days - any reason the stock has been so weak?POOL has been a big stock for a couple of years now and its multiple is expensive but expensive stocks stay expensive until fundamentals change.Are sales slowing? Are margins holding up?I'm long the stock and am looking for any insights b/c I'm starting to get nervous.

"I don't care what the shorts say about this stock. They are wrong. POOL has been an absolute monster in my portfolio, currently sitting on a 72 percent return. I owned at 60 at one point but got scared and sold my shares...biggest mistake and I'm still regretting it. But happy that I got back in. This is not a short-friendly stock and if you are short I advise you to cover now before you get smoked again."
Thank you POOL swimming in $$$

"Pool Corp. is among the best lesser-known stocks to buy, given the analyst community's rave reviews on it. POOL is among just a handful of stocks to earn the vaunted A+ rating from S&P Capital IQ. And research firm CFRA notes that beyond the obvious benefit of higher sales this summer as coronavirus squashes beach vacations and keeps more folks in their home pools, POOL is one of its favorite defensive plays.Analysts credit its dominant market share of regular maintenance spending and ""a strong balance sheet and liquidity position"" to weather any downturn.https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-19-of-the-best-stocks-youve-never-heard-of/index.html"

I would no more bet against POOL than I would play a game of Russian roulette. This company is a monster and has made me rich. Fully confident this will see $500 a share in the future.

"Now down about $60 from the high. Pool needs to have the marketing team come up with a way to promote pools as good for climate change. Then the stock will jump to new highs. Or maybe that when it rains, the pool stores the water. Got to use buzz words like ""green"", ""climate change"" or maybe just give AOC a pool in her backyard so she can promote pools as good for the environment."
WHATS your opinion on hayword holding HAYW !!
It is hard to tell what the price will be after hours we got to wait till normal hours tomorrow morning
Hi all. The cold snap in the south has resulted in millions or more in damage to pool equipment. Parts are sold out in the south. This is a boom to the pool business.

"A chlorine shortage is rocket fuel for stocks like POOL. POOL is the best of breed in its industry...excellent financial health, fantastic earnings growth, and in terms of capital returns it has been an absolute monster since 2015. No reason for me to think it won't trade at 500 in the future. I believe everyone should own this fantastic company. All it has done ever since I've owned it is put more and more money in my pocket. I've not only recouped my investment I've made a ton of extra money as well. The soil for this company to continue to grow is as fertile as that of a flood plain."
Up $5 down $10 repeat so sad.
