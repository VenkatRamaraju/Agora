Stock sucks they must be raising
I heard from some close friends in the device industry who have seen the technology of Acutis. They have worked for a large competitor of Acutis and they have interviewed for Acutis and passed on the job. They say that AFIBs technology is not yet ready for prime time.
AFIB reached an all time low at 24.47
@making$ so why post your negitive feed back? ...Just move on if you think this system is so inferior ...or short it if you are so confident.
This is a hidden and silent gem. They are already making money. Technology is cutting edge. Will buy some on any major dip. Cardiac ablation is on rise with aging population and younger patients with improved diagnostics.

"Questions: How many systems are actually being sold and not “placed”? What is the percentage of placed systems that were converted into a purchase? How many catheters are being used by the doctors every month? I guess this is what I want to know: when a doctor tries it out, are they staying with the Acutus system over the competition? Covid or not, I think these are things that could be specified and indicators if I should continue to invest long term."
"Bank America monthly hospital report shows July cardiac procedures were still down but much less so than orthopedic procedures—42% pf respondents noted their procedures decreased year over year compared to 58% respondents reporting that orthopedic/other have decreased during the same time period. Of course, both are well off their April lows. They noted the expediency factor. As in, one can put off a knee replacement but most times when it comes to matters of the heart, time is of the essence. It’s this factor us STXS longs should cling to in the hope of system sales. I’m just looking for a shiny penny. On another front, robotics etf inflows have been steadily growing."

"I believe it’s when-not if-that this tiny company will get bought out along with one of its collaborative partners STXS. Perhaps the same company will buy them both since their technologies perform so well together during procedures!......my only concern here is AFIB already has a too high justified valuation compared to its revenue stream and a small hiccup in the next qtr or so will tank the stock. We will get another leg up in the next week or so when the bankers initiate coverage with the customary buy recommendations but after that fervor subsides the company will be in a “prove” phase during Covid , not the best environment to sustain growth."

"Without an integrated ablation catheter, this company is doomed. They cannot sell mapping systems without it."
"""Placed"" systems means catheters ( consumable used ). Will COVID stop or eliminate heart attacks and storks?. Of course, not. It will increase them. Loading up at IPO price......"

this stock is a dog with fleas
Company works closely with STXS
AFIB is down 8.44% to 26.02
A one BILLION DOLLAR MARKET CAP for a company that just reported a million dollars in quarterly revenue and a huge loss.
"A Cardiologist I know stated that a high percentage of individuals experience AFIB after the age of 75. If Actutus Medical has an approved / better solution, the stock could be worth in the $80 range.. Time will tell. They probably need a little more financial runway to get there. Trend and adoption rate is encouraging."

Big trouble...can’t sell systems
"New here. The ticker symbol caught my attention. I had the ablation procedure and it was a life saver. This looks like a promising company. Consider this with regard to the disappointing earnings : When Covid hit, a vast majority of operations and procedures were put on hold. That is going to change and change fast. If the technology here is better, they will do just fine post Covid."
Great technology and at these levels I’m adding to my position.

They are the 5th mapping system on the market which is dominated by J&J and Abbott. There is nothing special about their technology and they are losing money fast.
Acutus Medical is down 8.61% to 12.42

The technology is a game changer if works as advertised!Reducing ablation time to 90 minutes from 3.5 hours..

#$%$ trash stock
Acutus Medical is down 7.77% to 13.29
Acutus Medical is up 8.40% to 16.26
With a drop this large - there must be institutional selling.I see no negative news.
Without an integrated ablation catheter this system will not gain market acceptance or revenues. It is the 5th mapping system to market. They are 2 years away from having an acceptable catheter portfolio. Way over valued at this stage.
"Can anyone experienced in reading sec files say if this is bad or not? Usually sec 3 filing is bad from what I read, but this seems like a purchase to me? Cheers https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001522860/000095010321002249/xslF345X02/dp146034_3-mcquillan.xml"

"The stock was doing Nothing today until a 193,000 share buy went through. There was some aggressive buying in after hours yesterday also. Someone is buying. I'll faint if it's Kathie Wood."
Why the > 7% drop today (3/3/2021)? I didn't see any news...
Abbott is crazy not to buy this company! It will give them a great mapping system to compete with J&J. Better if they bought both Acutus and Stereotaxis! The combination should give them a advantage over J&J!

"Buy low, sell high. Love it......"
"-10% today, This is oversold as hell. I am pretty sure tides will turn soon enough. Hoping to see this one shorted even more so I can load up before rebound, pref after $AGEN reaches post buyout price."

"During this big market selloff today, a big 162K share buy came through making AFIB spike well into the positive range. This stock has showed resiliency of late. I'm thinking there is accumulation going on."

"Hi Harvey, as an electrocardiologist, do you use STXS's Niobi robot ? if so, what are your views on Niobi, the recently released Genesis, and just the use of robots for AF procedures. STXS and AFIB recently announced the first integrated cardiac ablation procedure benefiting from remote TeleRobotic Support. i am long STXS and had intended to buy AFIB in the IPO , but it popped way above the IPO price and so i got gunshy"
