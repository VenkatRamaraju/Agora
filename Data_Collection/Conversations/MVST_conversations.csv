another red day from start to finish!
back to 15 soon?
"Hello traders!As you know, When I see the numbers, I call em.I see Mvst going pads $12.5 in 2 weeks time.Do your DD and trade accordingly "
They are looking to build another bigger plant in Germany :)
"I am never buying another unmerged SPAC again, they all lie about their revs"
"Slow but sure! Not bad compare today, given that most Techs are red"
Catching up slowly...as y'day this will go higher in the afternoon...don't miss the ride. !
Would be nice to be up tomorrow for once.
wee cannn weee cannn we can!!..
"All you have to do to make money here. Is hold, but more, hold again set your sell limits above 30. That’s it and be patient."
If this is not squeeze...then what else is?
Big Boys are piling up on stocks after these kind of drop! Just trade em! MVST should Pop Up towards $12 end of these 2 weeks.
Can someone explain how MVST market cap can still sit around USD 3 bn instead of 30 ?
Wake me when the warrants are $20
"based on what I've read MVST has ties to China with both manufacturing, supplies and mgmt. Not ideal but not a deal killer... Semiconductors. It's a problem.... all of this makes the stock a question mark. Some clarity and/or profits should help. But until then it wouldn't surprise me if it flirted with $4. I got out, got back in @$8.5 and I'm regretting it lol"
"I am also in $MVST. The shorts keep trying to drop that one, too, making it have a borrow rate of 113%. $MVST is up, today, despite it being a down day for the stock market. $BBIG is the hottest stock in the stock market, right now, so it will move much quicker than $MVST is moving."
Loaded another 8kGood luck all longs!!!..
close above 10
This is the second time in a week that I spoke to MVST IR. Basically I was venting out. Of course their reaction as usual was compliance to SEC regulations. But I reminded them that it is all about management that matters and explained some of the companies that faced tough times and how the management changed the challenges into opportunities! Basically I reminded the IR speak to the management to speak to investors what they will do and do what they speak as there is a concern now about the management resulting from the merger execution delays and revenue and bottom line mishaps! At the end of each call I was told they will convey my message to the management. Our Expression to IR may be a storm in the coffee cup but thought do it anyway!
A good indication..crossing above 9
Amazing today!
get the pr get the news get a new pr team I just want to see this going up from now on
MVST is under pressure from shorts to keep it below $10.50 until September 17. Hope some funds will buy a good quantity on or before September 17 to get a spike from squeeze!
Shady how this goes up every AH and pre and then just grinds down during the day.
"today will be a good day for mvst, showing some strength here"
7-8 usd fair value
Going to 10$
"So making the connections because that’s what I do, the controlling stake/D filing by Ashmore is related to Craig Webster who is a Director at MVST. Craig came from Ashmore, a manager on the special situations funds he was on their investment committee! All makes sense."
"Oshkosh contract is legit. Big gains coming here, MVST is primarily selected supplier for UPS order fulfillment. GL"
"Dang, a week’s worth of gains wiped out just like that."
"By looking at the chart, this will close at green."
Almost $8.50 looming. Surely tomorrow. May even set limit a little lower.
"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/2413524/quantumscape-vs-microvast-which-electric-vehicle-battery-stock-is-a-better-investment""The company’s management expects revenue to grow between 35% and 44% in 2021 while Wall Street forecasts sales at $143.53 million this year. Analysts also expect sales to grow by 79% to $257 million in 2022.Microvast continues to reinvest in business expansion projects that include building new production facilities and allocating funds for research and development. The company claims it has secured over $1.5 billion in contracts through 2027 and forecasts sales to touch $2.3 billion by 2025."""
This chart pretty much explains it allhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Microvast/comments/p5uq0q/q2_2021_revenues_mvst_vs_morgan_stanleys/
this is best in EV battery section with revenue and lot of new contract in pipeline. i am holding for next 12 month and see progress. easy $30-
Not much in the news front. We need some action in production and sales. QS got a nice boost with their latest order. Sales drive revenues drives sp.
i think what is left to do now is to flood their TWITTER account with msgs (maybe they'll notice they're not doing their job properly ) i mean why go public if they don't wanna communicate with the public? last news was from july and even the earning was a PR not even a call!! NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.
"PIPE is not subject to lock up period. Founding members shares: 25% is locked up 1 year and 75% is locked up for 2 years. SPAC and some others only have 6 months.Like many others in this forum, I expressed my concerns regarding the lack of communication time to time from MVST. I believe we need patience as well!"
I added 2k more again when this was down!!..man..now I have a ton. Should I buy options instead?
"If you look closely at the technical picture, you can see a ""W"" forming...In that case we hit 14 next coming weeks!"
Everyone buzzing over the big jump today. But no-one saying why is happened. I can't find any news.
Huh. Well... would you look at that.
"This is the grand dip of all dips, bigger than the big dipper!"
Serious question: what vehicles use Micros battery’s today? I see the Ford lightning announcement today and wondered if microvast supplies the batteries?? Thanks
"I swear, I added more and got this up from 8.50 premarket to 9...the volume is so low. Hopefully we see some green and I will clear some if that happens but really hold a lot of them ..LOL"
"""On The Rise And Fall Of Microvast (NASDAQ:MVST) | Seeking Alpha"" https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457951-on-the-rise-and-fall-of-microvast"
Adding on any significant dip.
"I look for the saddest bunch on the stock market, and that's where I buy.. LFG!!! If technical analysis serves us, this is currently gold at this price. Buy, hodl!!1!!!"
Here we go!Bad Sept is closing. Mvst should climb back up towards $12Trade accordingly.
Today could be that day we all longs are looking for.
Yep...my market ordered too this from 10.38 to 10.50...it was me.Thanks for the cheap shares.
"Funny, Ford went up yesterday because they stated they will collaborate with SK to make batteries. Meanwhile, we sell off."
red for the remainder of the day folks
We can’t go up regardless of market sentiment
Why is QS marketcap 3x this?
"Not sure why my post was deleted.I hoped for $12 today. There is so much manipulative practices on spacs based on holders getting out, shorting to facilitate makets, etc"
The change in revenue guidance made me sell 50% of my holdings. Believing nevertheless this will go x2-3 within a year
Can anyone scream and tell me where are we going??....
Warrants seem underpriced at 2.60 compared to other spacs in this price range around 12 no? Thinking of adding another 1000.
"We shouldn’t be surprised by the stocks performance. Down in a horrible tape! I have reviewed market structure and the “risk off” trades around SPAC’s. Yes they are still deemed a spac until they are not! There was and still is too much puplic supply of new companies and shares in the markets. Spacs have a whole host of market structure issues per merger and post merger. There are early investors selling cheap shares, insider overhang, tons of shorting around the merger deal. Think of like convertible debt hedging. The risk off trade has been on for months now and Spacs are definitely in the bucket of “sell these stocks” to bail out better quality well know names in the portfolio or sell these stocks because the market looks weak. I’m somewhat surprised it held up as well as it did! That’s encouraging. Also the EV trade is hear too stay."
What is this volume about? Christ
Now that’s the issue? All stocks this AM are EV’s! Why are we not at $20 yet???
"odd stock, not much makes sense, numbers are good in a desirable sector. yet a precipitous drop and forecasts are for $6 in a year.. Almost like a manipulation for a purchase?"
"Does anyone know the progress on the new plant in TN? Is it scheduled to come on line in ‘22 or ‘23, or later?"
why is MVST so hated?... Green stocks supposed to be Green today!
Offloaded the one that I bought today!!...you guys are awesome..but don't sell any of your shares.
If insiders are not selling then who else are?
Something is Brewing. Hold for the Gold. All the thumbs down are from newbies who sold at the all time lows. Hahahahaha
Here comes the Volume!
"Some made fun of me for selling at 14, look where it is now. I'm thinking of entering back soon"
"Come to me $8.50, I’m still waiting for you"
Literally down every day. Need news and volume.
It's possible that MVST might be the most volatile stock on the Exchange.
"Guidance only 145MThey said 240 in the investor presentation, that is a big difference."
Get ready for tomorrow!!!...
Remember when they kept saying as soon as Oshkosh wins the court battle MVST would shoot right up? Remember that? I do. Lol
finally a green day today
we'll be heading to 6 if mvst doesn't release any PR soon
NO SPACS FOR ME AGAIN
Lol if you invested in this I don't feel for you at all.
"Stock looking better. CNBC traders covered CHPT and Blink, all ties back to electric vehicles"
Another $Nio in making #MVST
This stock will double in a year
Just added more warrants on stock manipulation
What is the reason they keep dropping
yes...that was me market order of 8k at 9.78..thanks guys for the cheap shares.
Patience everyone! it's just consolidating-as of most stock that ran up during the past 2 days! This will pop up!
What a joke
This will be a bold call..but close green? What percentage you think?
"GWH up 40 % premarket ,another unprofitable battery maker."
Surely close above 11.50
"Next short squeeze will be MVST , but yes..this is a great investment as well."
Here we gooooooo
Shs outstanding 35.48M does anyone know the short float? >20???short ratio is 3.3 a bit high. Can v get below 1?
ZF Mobility seems to be using mvst batteries. ZF products are used by many in the auto industry. I think it is huge! Let’s see what news we get from MVST.
"WARRANTS ARE TOO CHEAp. Last time the stock was here (August), Warrants were $3.40-$3.60. Huge discount here. Buy to $3.25! Math doesn't lie."
Can we just have one Green Day please!
$6 buy in go go go!
Buy the dip boys
Strong Buying. 12+
Welcome on board. Please fasten your seat belts.
can someone explain the price jump?
Starting to wonder if it will ever get back to 17 again in my lifetime?
"If you weren't long before, you're long now...."
Added a thousand more shares today at $8.07. Think we are at the bottom.
I am not heavily invested here but i have nice medium size position for my portfolio.. i am going to put these shares in the basement and forget about them until 2025 where everyone needs batteries and the entire world is battery constrained and chinese government decides who gets what raw materials.. who will get preferential treatment? The Japanese and Korean players or this little gem? Why do you think Chinese are pouring into Afghanistan? Their concerns over human rights abuses? Or the incredible mineral riches needed to make batteries? When these factories come online this share price will look silly. This isn't a meme stock at all.. this is a real company laying the foundation to become a real player in the future. If Chinese government picks them to grow it could be big.
This stopped to be funny anymore
I guess good news for MVST Oshkosh deal. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/workhorse-voluntarily-dismisses-its-legal-challenge-usps-contract-2021-09-15/
"wow, that stoploss fall"
"Added 10k this morning, thanks guys for selling"
Oh now inflation matters? Lol ya okay keep talking. No one cares. This is such a crazy time to be in the markets. We can’t forecast it. Stay in green stocks! Mvst
If mvst is not sure of their prospect they would not build another plant in EU soon! They are planning to complete their Berlin plant in Q4 2021 and going to build another one. They are are seeing huge demand for their product and therefore the SP is going to go up soon. Refer S-1 filing of Aug 20. The BS analysts’ rating of sell is ……! Why would someone build a second plant in EU if they don’t have a demand for their products!
Way over sold...Impatient stock holders..
"$MVST is going to be $SPRT in spades. $MVST regularly gets a borrow rate over 100%, and it is a great investment not just a trade. All you have to do is buy $MVST, and sit on your hands."
own 30K of them now!!..LOL...averaging my as
To the moon and beyond
Expect this momentum to continue as there is some news of partnerships. The partnership information is not from Microvast.
"It's not just Microvast, it's every growth stock, SPAC, deSPAC, everything. Some kind of trading algorithm has obliterated every one of these securities. It's a cycle, and they hit hard this time similar to February through early May. Look at it this way, volume has been low or unremarkable for the last 10 trading days and MVST has gone 11+ to low 7. It hurts but its BS and all you can do to fight is add more or wait out the storm. I think this is a winner and I've cut loose some of my other growth plays to add more Microvast. Hang in there everyone!"
No matter what the close brings remember it was a day of nice price action and volume! Something is brewing here again! No idea why today but you could see the turn last week and the accumulation. Let’s hope we get to $25 before she reverses again
"I am holding it tight at 11.00+, but my order is filling up ..why are you guys selling anyways?"
Losing money is so incredibly fun. You learn to enjoy the color red.
All indications are pointing to 12+
Close over 10 (20SMA) would be strong! Can possibly run to 11+ next week
Is Microvast Holdings Inc (MVST) a Loser in the Industrials Sector? Source: https://goo.io/investorsobserver.com
Lawsuit dismissal could happen any day now. People are gonna be wishing they bought at these levels after then.
Any thoughts on the warrants?
"any chance anyone here lives near the old AKEBONO brake plant that MICROVAST bought ??? ... The address is:780 International Blvd Clarksville, TN 37040 .... I am curious if there is truly any activity spooling up there yet. it is a pretty big plant that originally (according to the news) was to have about 300 MVST employees.... I do think its way early for manufacturing at this site, but curious if they even are occupying the building or starting to do any remodeling to the brake and auto parts assembly lines that were left behind by AKEBONO."
"if this is a good company and has so much potential, how come no one see it."
"Here we come, Just like I was saying$12.50 end of 2 weeks time.That was Approx 2 weeks ago"
This is the third highest earning stock in my portfolio...expecting this to be at the top by close!!
"EV is picking up so will MVST. Do not just buy for short squeeze, this should go higher based on the demand for its products."
"Borrow rate is 85%, sit on your hands, MVST longs, sit on your hands, that's all you have to do."
this is the best in EV battery section with revenue and lots of new contracts- hold on for 5 years and this will be in $100 easy
Are we at the bottom yet? Because that's when I sell to buy something else that is ready to drop.
"its under pressure everyday, shorters world now"
"""Based on current business conditions, trends and other factors, Microvast is introducing a revenue guidance range for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 of $145.0 million to $155.0 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 34.9% to 44.2% compared to $107.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.""Last time I checked revenue of QS and it's still zero. And of course QS has a market cap of 8bil, vs MVST's 3bil. And don't forget MVST won the prestigious R&D 100 award in Dec 2019. ""For the past 56 years, R&D 100, coined the “Oscars of Innovation,” recognizes revolutionary technologies recently introduced to the market. On Dec 5, Microvast attended the R&D 100 Awards Banquet in San Mateo, CA, with several Fortune 500 companies, elite academic universities, and the esteemed U.S. national laboratories.“Our Technology Center is honoured to be recognized for our pioneering achievements in the exciting and growing world of electrification,” said Dr. Wenjuan Mattis, Chief Technology Officer of Microvast. “This award represents a culmination of over a decade of multi-discipline science resulting in a family of innovative products.”IMHO, this baby is worth at least 20 billions, which translates into $70 share price."
high quality article here: https://woodlandreport.com/2021/08/microvast-mvst-is-a-battery-tech-innovator-you-should-be-looking-at/
No clue why this site keeps deleting my message. One more time: mvst fully diluted shares outstanding is 35.49 based on Eikon. You should learn what diluted shares means since this is real number we consider. Very low shares out and float based on market cap. Easy to manipulate and gamma squeeze off the $15 calls. check out that option volume.
Hold hold hold lot more is coming
"New investor her , do you think this is the bottom?"
So we have a large seller this AM. Volume on track to break the 30 day daily average. Hmm
High demand to short this stock right now. My broker called me and told me the rate to borrow shares was at 48%
MICROWASTE WE NEED A PR
Wake me at $25 warrants
"Borrow rate is 90%, again. All you have to do is sit on your hands to make money in MVST."
11 by 12?
Finally up on this stock! I made on paper $100k by the first three days and have it all back in a week! Loaded the warrants back then and they are finally green again. I need to see $25 on the stock...
Hold! Hold! Hold! Shorts are trying to avoid a squeeze as September 17 options are a risk for them! So the mantra is hold! Buy any quantity that is affordable right now!
Told ya EV heating up again all over CNBC yesterday and there was an industry stat on EV cars by 2030 being over 30%.
Let's Go!
$15 by January 2022
"Do you all realize how short the Ofer Spac market is? As early investors redeem shares, the only place to short since there are not shares to short, are synthetically by using options! Buying puts and selling calls"
Loaded a ton this morning...thanks guys
"Short interest as of September 30 @14M+ shares (increased from 11M on September 15) and the ￼Price has been affected greatly by shorting! I believe if MVST is building / having 3 plants, it has some basis for building it. Moreover it has more than 1500 employees and expect to have $2B+ revenue in 2025. Therefore we should be fine regardless of current price level!"
"Ashmore Investment Management Ltd ownership in MVST / Microvast Holdings, Inc.2021-08-02 - Ashmore Investment Management Ltd has filed an SC 13D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing ownership of 23,503,434 shares of Microvast Holdings, Inc.

"And so it goes that if you hold long in a good stock, you should be rewarded, this is just the beginning, will see some pullback, but we are going up."
this is nice for a $12 Target
"When I look at 6 months charts, I see lot of cup and handles...but the handle seems to be broken now.."
Definitely wish I wouldn't have bought my Oct. calls
S1 filed last week. Just a matter of time.
"Covid is almost done especially after the release of the pill to treat covid, not prevent. The impact of that is massive. The logistics in manufacturing and transport because of labor shortages will revert back to normal. I give it another business quarter, 2 at the most before price stabilizes in commodities. Stocks like Microvast will have their time. Not this year but more to the end of the next year. Enjoy the cheap pricing and load up."
Touch 17 in few weeks..good chances before October end
Risk trade coming back on as I mentioned last week! This bodes well for SPAC companies and those that merged! Started in tech and then the memes again! Not it should be here.
This needs a surge.
"well, this is nice "
Consolidating
"Does anyone think that Ford's and GM's recently announced plans to build plants to make their own battering is hurting MVST? Seems to me there will still be plenty of demand for batteries from other EV manufacturers, especially considering we are in its infancy."
"Last hour was incredible, awesome!!"
"Serious question, not trolling. How does a company that only makes 30m in revenues get a market valuation of 2b?"
Is it better to buy shares or warrants? Anyone please to comment and explain the factual difference? Thanks in advance
"A short squeeze could be possible today. Especially, Last one hour may be interesting."
Worst investment of my life
"$QS is still in preproduction state. When it will deliver? $MVST is far better option with 100 M+ annual revenue from real products. And yes, $MVST is also working on solid state batteries."
"All I see bunch of micro holders noting old facts full of hope.Being a holder in 5 digits, one question comes to mind when a stock doesn’t go up and has tons of positive factor in the company. Question is:Are you the only person knowing all this facts of this stock or other people know as well, like bank investors, mutual funders, stock brokers, long position retail investors and so on…If so the price shall be much higher even today!We conclude something is not rightIf it is a Good stock then price shall increase slowly and surely not the price is in the mud going back and forth Best lesson to pick the right stock"
Poling . Going to 9 give a thumb up going to 6 give a thumb down
"Wow! Great to hear Workhorse voluntarily dismissed their own lawsuit against Oshkosh ... And they did it on the 11th hour of the judge's ruling! Makes one think if maybe they got wind of the judges outcome or perhaps agreed to an agreement with Oshkosh for them to pick up the slack if Microvast can't keep up in the filling of all those USPS EV orders for Oshkosh and the USPS or perhaps maybe they will be included in some way on that 6 billion order. After all, it's a massive order in a world with so many other massive commercial EV orders going on and many more coming, which means there should be plenty of room for everybody! According to a article I read, Workhorse said they intend to focus on moving forward with their business plans. So they probably have many other orders to fill anyways. So sounds like a win, win, in my book! It's been a long time a coming for the world to finally go EV in all the transportation segments. Can't wait for the day that every shuttle, bus, semi truck, train and all the cars run on batteries or hydrogen. Gives me hope for humanity, the environment and the planet. Now if we could all get along in this country and give the real and main EV companies some slack, (like they do in Europe without selloffs on headline noise or supply chain disruptions) and start working together towards the inevitable world renewable energy transition and the massive job opportunities it brings. Hey, who knows, maybe it would allow us to keep our EV innovations going on here in the US instead of it moving over to China or Europe, where they embrace their EV startup companies. After all, it's really the future we're talking about."
Oh god. I hope WSB doesn’t touch this again
PTRA better company but this better stock
"3.1B Cap, 33M revenue, 7M net loss"

Will this be the master of all squeezes?
Be pretty cool if this went up
Friday 7% up!!!...what does that say about MVST?
"Added another 2k...not on margin..I will hold this as long as it is needed. All the best!!..I am too long on this, but its ok."
Is this going back to 9 dollars
Need to break through 10 to go higher
close over 9.30 would be bullish
100+ mill revenue in 2021 but a market cap of 3.6B?

SHE A KEEPER. long term.
What a desperate shorting? The short interest went up considerably and stood at 11.8 M shares as of September 15 an increase of 3.5 million shares during last few days! I believe shorts will pay dearly for this greed! I hope MVST will come soon with some positive news and then we will see the fun.
We are red on green market
Wonder what is wrong with this stock? Nothing wrong. Only matter of proving what is right with it!
"I have held this  since December. Still bag holding at $15. I look a couple times a week hoping this  will go up. No news ever, used to say I would hold till $36. I will dump when it gets to $16"
Lets start the train to glory!

I wonder if today's over 14% drop has anything to do with Toyota Motor's announcement about a $13.5B plan to develop EV batteries.
and here we go again!! down 10% on the day
This thing is looking good! Over $12
Bought sept 17$ calls LETS GO
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHFB
Volume is picking up!
Why the hesitation! Go Greeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnn! We know you can make us real happy! Move Up!
There you go...!!!...touched highest for the day. Yet to see 12 by 12.
Holding on to 11% means...its a squeeze get ready!!..
Time to buy folks!
Finally closed green on a red day!!
Good day today
Added another 5k...LOL..I have gone crazy on this..but hopefully it turns out crazy positive for me. Seems like its the market that suppressed this down and some shorts taking advantage. buy when others are fearful quote
halted?
"If it is going under 9USD, I'll add more to bring my average price down. This company is solid compared to QS. Stocks always follow fundamentals sooner or later.Soon we will hear from Oshkosh too about their joint projects. Do not forget partners and clients $MVST has."
"Bought more...don't know if this is a good move...but yes, they are cheap"
consolidating at 7.3-7.8 before the next drop?
Over $8 again! We need to see $10 level soon and build on that.... boy it takes days to make highs and hours to be back below and months of stagflation
We are just a PR / SEC filing away from seeing a real spike!. Shorts have the opportunity now to cover or get burned soon!
"Microvast investors are in desperate need of forward guidance from the captains running this ship, news on something, anything to show the lights are on? Lol. That's all, any sign of a heart beat."
