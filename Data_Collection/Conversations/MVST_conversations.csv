Do you guys see some green light at the end of the tunnel? LOL
HOLD! This is a $30+ stock.They are doing stop loss raid so they get your shares at the pullback.
OMG we going up.Glad I bought more in the 8s. I own a ton of this
"Bottomline for all the longs. Hopeful longterm but when you cut your revenue estimates in half which was plastered on all presentations then delay your filings investors throw the company right into the ""show me"" camp. And it's not trading 1x sales either so lots of praying needed"
Would be nice to be up tomorrow for once.
"Borrow rate is 85%, sit on your hands, MVST longs, sit on your hands, that's all you have to do."
"Solid company, excellent opportunity for growth. I am in 9k for the long run."
Volume is picking up!
Looks like another great day. :)
Hard to believe this was $16 just a few days ago....insane volatility on no news....I'm looking to start a position but it keeps getting more delicious every day....tricky to time an entry
this is best in EV battery section with revenue and lot of new contract in pipeline. i am holding for next 12 month and see progress. easy $30-
"warrants are waiting for stock to solidify above 10.20. should be 3.30 expect a jump to that if stock keeps its footing. I strongly recommend not trying to time this, but hold, 10 is nothing, 3 for warrants is nothing. just hold, stock will be 30 in no time, warrants will be anywhere from 7.50 to 25 (yes, the mvstw a 3 right now going to 7.5-25) patience"
Big Dogs have been loading this. Best battery play out there.
"$QS is still in preproduction state. When it will deliver? $MVST is far better option with 100 M+ annual revenue from real products. And yes, $MVST is also working on solid state batteries."
"next week 20s, easy."
"Currently at 11.71, close green today or close to green."
Price target: $85 since it is probably worth 4X QS.
"If we did not worry when it was below $8, why worry now?"
"This ain’t even the real run, when it’s above 30 and you see over 100M volume in one day then THAT’S the run. "
MVST worth 4X QS.
"I don't usually use the term but if we HODL then bigger fish will feel confident investing in it and stabilizing the share price at a higher level! Feel free to trade, but if you can HODL it's better for everyone in the long run!"
Going to 10$
"I have a really good feeling about this, if it closes above 10.50, I would like to see a torrent of volume boosting it even more tomorrow!"
Just crossed the 50 EMA ( 10.83) next stop is 13
its better than QS- lets take it to $100
close above 10
Strong price move on heavy volume. Looks like a great day for the longs. I luv this stock!! :)
"All in MVST and PTRA the biggest worldwide comercial EV batteries supplier,"
"Hello traders!As you know, When I see the numbers, I call em.I see Mvst going pads $12.5 in 2 weeks time.Do your DD and trade accordingly "
"Guidance only 145MThey said 240 in the investor presentation, that is a big difference."
The change in revenue guidance made me sell 50% of my holdings. Believing nevertheless this will go x2-3 within a year
Touch 17 in few weeks..good chances before October end
If people notice last time $10 is the base price . Now at 10.22 it is still a super bargain
margin calls close to close?
"Added 10k this morning, thanks guys for selling"
Is Microvast Holdings Inc (MVST) a Loser in the Industrials Sector? Source: https://goo.io/investorsobserver.com
Good chance to buy more
Hopefully we can close the gap at $9.62
can anyone get the report?
7-8 usd fair value
"as a general rule now is the low point in the market, and were 6m volume up 9% lol"
"well, this is nice "
Guess: Where is the Morgan Stanley Analyst hiding his face now?
"If it is going under 9USD, I'll add more to bring my average price down. This company is solid compared to QS. Stocks always follow fundamentals sooner or later.Soon we will hear from Oshkosh too about their joint projects. Do not forget partners and clients $MVST has."
What y'all think about the earning this quarter. Any chance it would be higher this quarter then last quarter as the company have been improved so much.
Very good day . While Most stocks are tanking. MVST is gapping towards $12
"today will be a good day for mvst, showing some strength here"
Patience everyone! it's just consolidating-as of most stock that ran up during the past 2 days! This will pop up!
Friday 7% up!!!...what does that say about MVST?
It's possible that MVST might be the most volatile stock on the Exchange.
this is the best in EV battery section with revenue and lots of new contracts- hold on for 5 years and this will be in $100 easy
"Ashmore Investment Management Ltd ownership in MVST / Microvast Holdings, Inc.2021-08-02 - Ashmore Investment Management Ltd has filed an SC 13D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing ownership of 23,503,434 shares of Microvast Holdings, Inc.

ZF Mobility seems to be using mvst batteries. ZF products are used by many in the auto industry. I think it is huge! Let’s see what news we get from MVST.
24 M in volume today wow!
"While the amateurs were selling under $10, I was loading the boat."
100+ mill revenue in 2021 but a market cap of 3.6B?
"I will admit it, I was wrong. But I never sold and don’t plan on it, the furtive is bright."
Does anyone know when they announce their next earnings? I'm looking at their website and don't see that date. Thanks in advance.
Hold hold hold lot more is coming
high quality article here: https://woodlandreport.com/2021/08/microvast-mvst-is-a-battery-tech-innovator-you-should-be-looking-at/

Why the hesitation! Go Greeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnn! We know you can make us real happy! Move Up!
Any thoughts on the warrants?

"MVST, a great EV battery company, doing solid work delivering the most advanced and reliable batteries, transforming the world one battery at a time, is a top-quality investment."
added 100k more shares
Microvast is a large and long established company with contracts in many countries. It has joint veture with Oshkosh. Oshkosh has the USPS contract and holds shares in Microvast.Expect eatnings and forecast to be great.
wee cannn weee cannn we can!!..
"""Based on current business conditions, trends and other factors, Microvast is introducing a revenue guidance range for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 of $145.0 million to $155.0 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 34.9% to 44.2% compared to $107.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.""Last time I checked revenue of QS and it's still zero. And of course QS has a market cap of 8bil, vs MVST's 3bil. And don't forget MVST won the prestigious R&D 100 award in Dec 2019. ""For the past 56 years, R&D 100, coined the “Oscars of Innovation,” recognizes revolutionary technologies recently introduced to the market. On Dec 5, Microvast attended the R&D 100 Awards Banquet in San Mateo, CA, with several Fortune 500 companies, elite academic universities, and the esteemed U.S. national laboratories.“Our Technology Center is honoured to be recognized for our pioneering achievements in the exciting and growing world of electrification,” said Dr. Wenjuan Mattis, Chief Technology Officer of Microvast. “This award represents a culmination of over a decade of multi-discipline science resulting in a family of innovative products.”IMHO, this baby is worth at least 20 billions, which translates into $70 share price."
Close Green today ?...I am always a green guy on this :)
They bring it to the market and sell it to pipe investors for $10 and more and then after merger put a $6 price target. Bottom line is they are not to be Trusted!
I’m long this stock. There was talk that they had meetings with Daimler and Volvo. I have screen shots from the daily meeting logs. It’s going to be a nice nest egg for me.
We should be looking for $12 by 11
I’m not a fortune teller I’m just a technical analysis guy and according to my analysis we have a prosperous month ahead.
I added to my collection today. Had a buy order in for $13.75 in case it dropped and was happy to see I got filled. Thanks to whoever sold them to me. Haha
Be pretty cool if this went up
yes...that was me market order of 8k at 9.78..thanks guys for the cheap shares.
Loos like Morgan Stanky didn’t get the desired affect of driving this down to 6 bucks. They will just to have to buy at the current numbers
"If you weren't long before, you're long now...."
Holding on to 11% means...its a squeeze get ready!!..
"I am holding it tight at 11.00+, but my order is filling up ..why are you guys selling anyways?"
Pre-market got me like
It is still very cheap even at $15
Buying
All in
"All you have to do to make money here. Is hold, but more, hold again set your sell limits above 30. That’s it and be patient."
added 3k this morning...thanks for cheap shares
They are looking to build another bigger plant in Germany :)
wouldnt suprise me if we see 12 today
Risk trade coming back on as I mentioned last week! This bodes well for SPAC companies and those that merged! Started in tech and then the memes again! Not it should be here.
"Borrow rate is still 90%, so, really, no one is selling."
"Do you all realize how short the Ofer Spac market is? As early investors redeem shares, the only place to short since there are not shares to short, are synthetically by using options! Buying puts and selling calls"
when will we see redemption?
back to 15 soon?
"Dang, a week’s worth of gains wiped out just like that."
"All I see bunch of micro holders noting old facts full of hope.Being a holder in 5 digits, one question comes to mind when a stock doesn’t go up and has tons of positive factor in the company. Question is:Are you the only person knowing all this facts of this stock or other people know as well, like bank investors, mutual funders, stock brokers, long position retail investors and so on…If so the price shall be much higher even today!We conclude something is not rightIf it is a Good stock then price shall increase slowly and surely not the price is in the mud going back and forth Best lesson to pick the right stock"
"The confidence level in MVST cannot be any higher. We all know MVST is going to deliver result after result for its shareholders. The current share price for MVST means nothing, except an excellent buying opportunity."
How many of you will be Millionaires by the end of this run?
"Right now I am happy we are seeing such a +ve movement in the stock, but I don't feel good if I have to expect all of my shares to be short squeezed. I do put some effort to identify stocks which is a good investment, but sometimes that turns out to be bad based on the risk/reward ratios. But I am surprised why this one has taken a hit recently from 20's to 8's. Hope to see 15 soon."
"So making the connections because that’s what I do, the controlling stake/D filing by Ashmore is related to Craig Webster who is a Director at MVST. Craig came from Ashmore, a manager on the special situations funds he was on their investment committee! All makes sense."
What are these warrants? Exercise price and expiry date?Is it 11.50 & 5 years?Gl!
11 by 12?
i think its going to go up.
PTRA better company but this better stock
"I have posted many times about the poor trading of SPacs. They are sort of the red headed step child of the market. They are the true risk of trade and when markets gets jittery people sell these first. It’s strange because This is not a spac any more! I also own bark, another great company in very hot market. Makes no sense.... terrific recurring business model...I’m trying to be patient and ignoring the naysayers and short motivated people on here. I was watching everyday Hoping for $20-$30, but not don’t look every day. Just put it away..."
"Yup, we are going for $15/share"
Tomorrow open PEAK: $18.5 — HOD PT: 22
I wonder if today's over 14% drop has anything to do with Toyota Motor's announcement about a $13.5B plan to develop EV batteries.
"its under pressure everyday, shorters world now"
MVST is under pressure from shorts to keep it below $10.50 until September 17. Hope some funds will buy a good quantity on or before September 17 to get a spike from squeeze!
This chart pretty much explains it allhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Microvast/comments/p5uq0q/q2_2021_revenues_mvst_vs_morgan_stanleys/
I think this drop is due to problems in China
Buy the dip boys
Told ya EV heating up again all over CNBC yesterday and there was an industry stat on EV cars by 2030 being over 30%.
Don’t curse my stock but over $10Will be very positive. I expected to be at $25 by now.
"Wow! Great to hear Workhorse voluntarily dismissed their own lawsuit against Oshkosh ... And they did it on the 11th hour of the judge's ruling! Makes one think if maybe they got wind of the judges outcome or perhaps agreed to an agreement with Oshkosh for them to pick up the slack if Microvast can't keep up in the filling of all those USPS EV orders for Oshkosh and the USPS or perhaps maybe they will be included in some way on that 6 billion order. After all, it's a massive order in a world with so many other massive commercial EV orders going on and many more coming, which means there should be plenty of room for everybody! According to a article I read, Workhorse said they intend to focus on moving forward with their business plans. So they probably have many other orders to fill anyways. So sounds like a win, win, in my book! It's been a long time a coming for the world to finally go EV in all the transportation segments. Can't wait for the day that every shuttle, bus, semi truck, train and all the cars run on batteries or hydrogen. Gives me hope for humanity, the environment and the planet. Now if we could all get along in this country and give the real and main EV companies some slack, (like they do in Europe without selloffs on headline noise or supply chain disruptions) and start working together towards the inevitable world renewable energy transition and the massive job opportunities it brings. Hey, who knows, maybe it would allow us to keep our EV innovations going on here in the US instead of it moving over to China or Europe, where they embrace their EV startup companies. After all, it's really the future we're talking about."
"Some made fun of me for selling at 14, look where it is now. I'm thinking of entering back soon"
Is this a buy at 12.70 or am I chasing it?
"blowing up on wsb, and many other subreddits. just be cautious with some of the jumps. this isnt a 10 to 15 stock. it's a 30 to 100 stock. all depends on pending news / this years performance"
ok then close above 14
SHE A KEEPER. long term.
own 30K of them now!!..LOL...averaging my as
This joke of a stock has has given me some big bags to hold
They just merged last month and now they say they’ll miss projections? Too funny!
Everyone buzzing over the big jump today. But no-one saying why is happened. I can't find any news.
"Here we come, Just like I was saying$12.50 end of 2 weeks time.That was Approx 2 weeks ago"
"Stock looking better. CNBC traders covered CHPT and Blink, all ties back to electric vehicles"
"I don't know who needs to hear this but a rise and fall in this stock or many are not result of WSB. period. WSB & Reddit became a tool to discuss stocks just like this forum. Blaming wsb is a cop out, this is a solid play great future and happens to be heavily shorted. if you're a bear on this stock dont you think the fluctuation would be from the shorts because they don't want to lose money.... THEY WILL LOSE THIS ONE.GLTL"
Consolidating
all those good people gonna keep leaving this stock if they keep running into the floor.
MVST is the EV future!
couple of hours...are we crossing 10?
"I like to formally invite Cathie Wood to join us here, in MVST, the best newly public EV battery company."
lol already back to the 10s and 9s and 8s and....
Don’t delay. Buy today
"Going according to numbers, not short or long currently, MVST might correct back down to 8.50 to 9.Just my opinion all."
what is you take on the financial report
"Oshkosh contract is legit. Big gains coming here, MVST is primarily selected supplier for UPS order fulfillment. GL"
So we have a large seller this AM. Volume on track to break the 30 day daily average. Hmm
adding more today
Im bearish since the revenue miss
"If this stock puts in bad ER, then I will lose all faith in all SPACs.MVST is one of the best battery producers in the world, and they will also have some of the highest manufacturing output when their 2 new factories fully come online. On top of that they have great tech and make a great product."
"And so it goes that if you hold long in a good stock, you should be rewarded, this is just the beginning, will see some pullback, but we are going up."
"Not sure why my post was deleted.I hoped for $12 today. There is so much manipulative practices on spacs based on holders getting out, shorting to facilitate makets, etc"
Market is going to turn green today !!..this is a good one to make quick bucks
Close over 10 (20SMA) would be strong! Can possibly run to 11+ next week
By Aug 20th we should be cruising past $20 IMO
"$OSK corporate jet landed in Clarksville Tennessee after the ups contract was announced, Leaked documents through a portal showed daimler and Indian Volo meetings"
Shs outstanding 35.48M does anyone know the short float? >20???short ratio is 3.3 a bit high. Can v get below 1?
Oh god. I hope WSB doesn’t touch this again
"RMO bad, MVST good."
When can the short squeeze be expected? What needs to happen?
Stanley Whittingham won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 for pioneering research leading to the development of the lithium-ion battery. He is the director at MVST.https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/whittingham/facts/https://microvast.com/leadership-governance/
A good indication..crossing above 9
Fewer and fewer sellers
No clue why this site keeps deleting my message. One more time: mvst fully diluted shares outstanding is 35.49 based on Eikon. You should learn what diluted shares means since this is real number we consider. Very low shares out and float based on market cap. Easy to manipulate and gamma squeeze off the $15 calls. check out that option volume.
"wow, that stoploss fall"
"Borrow rate is 90%, again. All you have to do is sit on your hands to make money in MVST."
"Come to me $8.50, I’m still waiting for you"
Shorts this morning
Yeah green
I got a 12 bagger out of QS got in at the very bottom and sold for 122 and somehow MVST is still at the SPAC level when I bought in even though they actually have a product to sell and are far better than QS. Makes no sense.
"if this is a good company and has so much potential, how come no one see it."
I am convinced that mvst sp will be above $100. The maximum time needed to realize it will be a year. If we get there before that I will be more than pleased to have it! But today’s price in my opinion is very much undervalued!
"sorry folks for pumping this up, seems like it is manipulated to not bounce back ...LOL"
Bought sept 17$ calls LETS GO
Buying 85 shares once market opens… Li batteries will be in high demand the next coming years
Here comes the Volume!
Let’s keep buying and hold. Reditt is coming
$20 tomorrow
"OZOP, two days ago partnered with TSLA, today awarded Canadian contract. Get in"
Cmon $8.50 the big dog wants back in. I got $8500 say MVST will be great one day
"great short report out, this is going to the moon soon"
Huh. Well... would you look at that.
The sky is the limit...no shares to short
Why is this share going up???
Ill take a green day when everything else is down!
What is this volume about? Christ
Expecting a short cover rally
Honestly this drop is good because we have been going up 20% a day so a little pull back is normal and it gives us time to buy more
I know absolutely nothing about this stock but FOMO is feeling real. Should I F MO?
This thing is looking good! Over $12
"$5.9bil pipeline, $1.5bil of which has already been contracted. It is in advanced discussions with two other global customers that could provide another $3bil in contracted rev https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4402962-microvast-best-ev-spac-may-arrived"
Hold! Hold! Hold! Shorts are trying to avoid a squeeze as September 17 options are a risk for them! So the mantra is hold! Buy any quantity that is affordable right now!
"Microvast should be $140, right now, because Microvast is already where QS hoped to be, when QS was $140."
What’s the reason fro 20% jump?
Know what you own!!Microvast's first phase of production in Clarksville TN will make the company the largest Li-ion manufacturer in the US. This plant was established in 2019 at the request of US DOE. They already have contracted revenue of 230M this year and CAGR of 87% to 2025.
If mvst is not sure of their prospect they would not build another plant in EU soon! They are planning to complete their Berlin plant in Q4 2021 and going to build another one. They are are seeing huge demand for their product and therefore the SP is going to go up soon. Refer S-1 filing of Aug 20. The BS analysts’ rating of sell is ……! Why would someone build a second plant in EU if they don’t have a demand for their products!
Now we just need 5 more +20% days :)
"let's be realistic for just a second because were all feeling a little bit like we just drank our very first cappuccino and experiencing the caffeine rush for the first time... mvst was undervalued at 20. a good fundamental assessment should put this between 25 and 30. heres a lesson worth a lifetime of wealth if you listen- value comes down to 2 things 1 fundamentals (what ecominocs tell you its worth) and 2 hype (what people tell you its worth) fundamentals take time to establish like a rolling wave. hype is like the wave peaking that everyone wants to be part of. making money in the market is as simple as finding something with fundamentals that will catch up to something similar that's hyped. look for something 5x or greater and your golden. right now were way below fundamentals (25-30) but what about hype? if hype lasts long enough it will morph into fundamentals. for the fun part, what should hype be? well that's where qs comes in, by their example of what hype could bring us we could run anywhere from 100 to 250 (no that's not a joke) this brings me the point, at what exit should we look toward? I would say anywhere from 50 to 120 would be my estimate. glta this wave is about to turn into a tsunami"
Sort of relief that the results weren't worse with all the set back in manufacturing due to material shortages and increased price spikes. I expect all this to become smoother as we go into the next quarters.
"Here’s my view on it.As you know MVST made recent huge gains. Naturally, this was going to attract short interest, and that along with weak hands and low volume has made the price drop. BITF also had an ""identical"" situation with the big gains. Yesterday, it dropped 15% and amazingly, slowly clawed its way back. Today, at one point is was up more than 13%, but as I write it's up 10%. It's only a matter of time before MVST returns to very high levels. It might not happen today, but it will happen some time soon."
"I am never buying another unmerged SPAC again, they all lie about their revs"
"Not selling, we have seen analysts manipulating! I experienced it with NIO"
In for the long run!
"odd stock, not much makes sense, numbers are good in a desirable sector. yet a precipitous drop and forecasts are for $6 in a year.. Almost like a manipulation for a purchase?"
Wake me at $25 warrants
Believe it or not Microvast will be a topic for the next few days/weeks similar to GME
To the moon and beyond
"EV is picking up so will MVST. Do not just buy for short squeeze, this should go higher based on the demand for its products."
this is nice for a $12 Target
"Slow but sure! Not bad compare today, given that most Techs are red"
"To FOMO or not to FOMO, that id the question. Hmmmm..."
Bought some more shares. Brought down my average.
"I am also in $MVST. The shorts keep trying to drop that one, too, making it have a borrow rate of 113%. $MVST is up, today, despite it being a down day for the stock market. $BBIG is the hottest stock in the stock market, right now, so it will move much quicker than $MVST is moving."
"$MVST is going to be $SPRT in spades. $MVST regularly gets a borrow rate over 100%, and it is a great investment not just a trade. All you have to do is buy $MVST, and sit on your hands."
"you see the mistakes everybody makes and I guess they just have to learn for themselves. for the newbies, after hour down or up is nothing to worry about, some scared kids are letting some shares go, other smart ones buying them up when they drop. unless you see a 25% gain or lost post or pre market, it's just noise and has no real basis. the real indicator for me was the high volume today. seems like a swing trade from friday. a percentage will take their gains and a percentage will be back. expect volitility before each floor is reached. 15 is the next floor. it's not if but when. share price always catches up to fundamentals (or overshoots it like gme and amc) and fundamentally it's undervalued at 25 - this is turning point in history, the un just pulled over 1000 studies saying we need to go green immediately. there are so many catalysts to drive further than fundamentals so as I have said before 100 to 200 is no joke. buy dips and increase shares because there are very few opportunities like this one"
"If you look closely at the technical picture, you can see a ""W"" forming...In that case we hit 14 next coming weeks!"
First time i buy and now this? 
No matter what the close brings remember it was a day of nice price action and volume! Something is brewing here again! No idea why today but you could see the turn last week and the accumulation. Let’s hope we get to $25 before she reverses again
Loaded a ton this morning...thanks guys
"I am the longest long on MVST, but seems like seekingalpha article also says some good things about this stock. 19.42 price target (..LOL for .42)This stock is highly shorted This stock is in a very trendy market called 'EV'This stock already has joint ventures from OSK etcThis stock already has supply agreements This stock is no more Main Land China stock as believedJust one bad situation is market is taken down due to Virus spread, but that will be soon gone..you all just get vaccinated and enjoy the beautiful life"
15$ tomorrow?
Offloaded the one that I bought today!!...you guys are awesome..but don't sell any of your shares.
Warrants seem underpriced at 2.60 compared to other spacs in this price range around 12 no? Thinking of adding another 1000.
Literally down every day. Need news and volume.
Only EV stock that's up today!
"Not sure about $60, but $30 is certainly a possibility!!! :)"
There you go...!!!...touched highest for the day. Yet to see 12 by 12.
Something is Brewing. Hold for the Gold. All the thumbs down are from newbies who sold at the all time lows. Hahahahaha

When markets sell off, these are the first to go! $10 should still be the line in the sand for a bottom..."
Did not think this can tank or go red :) ...stock market is always expect what is not expected
Need to break through 10 to go higher
Serious question: what vehicles use Micros battery’s today? I see the Ford lightning announcement today and wondered if microvast supplies the batteries?? Thanks
It’s a smart play by Morgan Stanley Put a low ball target on it a week before they post their 1 set of numbers ever. Scoop up a boat load of shared at 5 or 6 bucks then reset the price point after they announce. Then sell on the spike.
Are we going to get the news about OSK today?
still going for 500 usd per piece?
Big Close coming. Charts screaming upwards.

"Now that we closed above 20% today, hopefully we get some news articles reporting this to everyone and get on their radar!"
Finally up on this stock! I made on paper $100k by the first three days and have it all back in a week! Loaded the warrants back then and they are finally green again. I need to see $25 on the stock...
Today could be that day we all longs are looking for.
"Never mind, I see why people call manipulation and all other related jargons, I have not seen a stock hit so hard even at this level while having such a potential (from my point of view). Market is just so bad, but that is not the only reason apart from some unknown reason (maybe profit taking). But anyways, added another 2k during close and hope to see you all above 15 soon."
Need the warrants to print $20! What would the shares need to be?
Expect this momentum to continue as there is some news of partnerships. The partnership information is not from Microvast.
5M traded...and 10% up...so what does this say?
I guess good news for MVST Oshkosh deal. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/workhorse-voluntarily-dismisses-its-legal-challenge-usps-contract-2021-09-15/
"Wallet Investor has it at one year $115.00 per share, and 5 years at $521.00 per share. Check it out."
Lawsuit dismissal could happen any day now. People are gonna be wishing they bought at these levels after then.
$20 tomorrow ? 
This was most likely early investor selling. Stop with the pump & dump comments. That was weeks ago from reddit if anything.
To all the people who don’t see the picture. First thing this is not GME or AMC this is a company that is in a new born industry of EVs. With so many companies that dont even earn a dime this company has contracted revenue of $ 2 billion. It also has grown its revenue 140%+ YoY. It is also researching and devoloping solid state battery as well to keep up with innovation while retaining its current lithium packs. I see this company easily being 50 billion+ market capitalization with so much growth potential.
What? Now you don’t want to play? Up 100% in three sessions and you didn’t think selling would happen? Relax and take the opportunity to add!
How many are there with me thinking this will cross support $11.50 mark after market ???
Way over sold...Impatient stock holders..
Is it better to buy shares or warrants? Anyone please to comment and explain the factual difference? Thanks in advance
close over 9.30 would be bullish

"Next short squeeze will be MVST , but yes..this is a great investment as well."
"WARRANTS ARE TOO CHEAp. Last time the stock was here (August), Warrants were $3.40-$3.60. Huge discount here. Buy to $3.25! Math doesn't lie."
"I swear, I added more and got this up from 8.50 premarket to 9...the volume is so low. Hopefully we see some green and I will clear some if that happens but really hold a lot of them ..LOL"
"The warrants behaved like this with $MVST at the announcement of the merger with THCB, but they went to the right price after two weeks. I think $GRNVW will do the same."
MICROWASTE WE NEED A PR
"Bought more...don't know if this is a good move...but yes, they are cheap"

"3.1B Cap, 33M revenue, 7M net loss"
Classic Algo technique to trigger stop loss.
Remember when they kept saying as soon as Oshkosh wins the court battle MVST would shoot right up? Remember that? I do. Lol
BUY whatever Adam Jonas bets against.
"Expect there to be dips, expect there to be down days but I’m also expecting $20-$50 at some point"
