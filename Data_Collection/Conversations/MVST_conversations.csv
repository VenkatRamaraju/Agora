PTRA better company but this better stock
Here we gooooooo
What a joke
"A short squeeze could be possible today. Especially, Last one hour may be interesting."
red for the remainder of the day folks
"Last hour was incredible, awesome!!"
Added another 5k...LOL..I have gone crazy on this..but hopefully it turns out crazy positive for me. Seems like its the market that suppressed this down and some shorts taking advantage. buy when others are fearful quote
"$QS is still in preproduction state. When it will deliver? $MVST is far better option with 100 M+ annual revenue from real products. And yes, $MVST is also working on solid state batteries."
"""On The Rise And Fall Of Microvast (NASDAQ:MVST) | Seeking Alpha"" https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457951-on-the-rise-and-fall-of-microvast"
Offloaded the one that I bought today!!...you guys are awesome..but don't sell any of your shares.
Need to break through 10 to go higher
Yep...my market ordered too this from 10.38 to 10.50...it was me.Thanks for the cheap shares.
Bought sept 17$ calls LETS GO
This will be a bold call..but close green? What percentage you think?
"Dang, a week’s worth of gains wiped out just like that."
"Bought more...don't know if this is a good move...but yes, they are cheap"
Not much in the news front. We need some action in production and sales. QS got a nice boost with their latest order. Sales drive revenues drives sp.
MVST is under pressure from shorts to keep it below $10.50 until September 17. Hope some funds will buy a good quantity on or before September 17 to get a spike from squeeze!
"Stock looking better. CNBC traders covered CHPT and Blink, all ties back to electric vehicles"
Be pretty cool if this went up
another red day from start to finish!
"Microvast investors are in desperate need of forward guidance from the captains running this ship, news on something, anything to show the lights are on? Lol. That's all, any sign of a heart beat."
$40 ? TWO YEARS MAX.
Lol if you invested in this I don't feel for you at all.
Are we at the bottom yet? Because that's when I sell to buy something else that is ready to drop.
"any chance anyone here lives near the old AKEBONO brake plant that MICROVAST bought ??? ... The address is:780 International Blvd Clarksville, TN 37040 .... I am curious if there is truly any activity spooling up there yet. it is a pretty big plant that originally (according to the news) was to have about 300 MVST employees.... I do think its way early for manufacturing at this site, but curious if they even are occupying the building or starting to do any remodeling to the brake and auto parts assembly lines that were left behind by AKEBONO."
$6 buy in go go go!
Almost $8.50 looming. Surely tomorrow. May even set limit a little lower.
MICROWASTE WE NEED A PR
Loaded a ton this morning...thanks guys
Good day today
Catching up slowly...as y'day this will go higher in the afternoon...don't miss the ride. !
Here comes the Volume!
"Someone posted about Microvast/Apple connection a few months ago, anyone remember who it was? They apparently knew of meetings. Whether its true or not is unknown but i'd like to hear what the person has to say on the progress."
Surely close above 11.50
Now that’s the issue? All stocks this AM are EV’s! Why are we not at $20 yet???
"Earnings are expected on November 8 or latest by Nov 14. If the earnings are a beat from their forecast, we will see betterment of prices depending on by how much it beat the guidance. If results are just on the expected level or less then the price may go down further. In the meantime shorts are adding to their positions. As of Oct 15 the short interest is around 15.8 million shares vs 14.X Million on September 30. So far shorts are winning! I look forward to a better earnings from MVST in q3! Can we get it?"
Amazing today!
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHFB
Big Boys are piling up on stocks after these kind of drop! Just trade em! MVST should Pop Up towards $12 end of these 2 weeks.
"Does anyone know the progress on the new plant in TN? Is it scheduled to come on line in ‘22 or ‘23, or later?"
close above 10
Definitely wish I wouldn't have bought my Oct. calls
Why is QS marketcap 3x this?
https://discord.gg/N4awEqMKrt
Hold! Hold! Hold! Shorts are trying to avoid a squeeze as September 17 options are a risk for them! So the mantra is hold! Buy any quantity that is affordable right now!
To the moon and beyond
This is the second time in a week that I spoke to MVST IR. Basically I was venting out. Of course their reaction as usual was compliance to SEC regulations. But I reminded them that it is all about management that matters and explained some of the companies that faced tough times and how the management changed the challenges into opportunities! Basically I reminded the IR speak to the management to speak to investors what they will do and do what they speak as there is a concern now about the management resulting from the merger execution delays and revenue and bottom line mishaps! At the end of each call I was told they will convey my message to the management. Our Expression to IR may be a storm in the coffee cup but thought do it anyway!
$15 by January 2022
Trend is turning around! https://twitter.com/_greenfinance/status/1423085729572429828?t=h1yAklKb5bHD12VtBfYlog&s=19
"If it is going under 9USD, I'll add more to bring my average price down. This company is solid compared to QS. Stocks always follow fundamentals sooner or later.Soon we will hear from Oshkosh too about their joint projects. Do not forget partners and clients $MVST has."
i think what is left to do now is to flood their TWITTER account with msgs (maybe they'll notice they're not doing their job properly ) i mean why go public if they don't wanna communicate with the public? last news was from july and even the earning was a PR not even a call!! NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.
$9 october 15 puts first thing in the morning for me
Someone sold and I loaded a ton!!..thanks guys ..have a wonderful weekend.
"based on what I've read MVST has ties to China with both manufacturing, supplies and mgmt. Not ideal but not a deal killer... Semiconductors. It's a problem.... all of this makes the stock a question mark. Some clarity and/or profits should help. But until then it wouldn't surprise me if it flirted with $4. I got out, got back in @$8.5 and I'm regretting it lol"
I guess good news for MVST Oshkosh deal. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/workhorse-voluntarily-dismisses-its-legal-challenge-usps-contract-2021-09-15/
I am simply stunned by the companies lack of informing its investors of future endeavours. Not a like of news in several months? I am truly regretting putting my money here. These spacs really stink. You buy into concepts to make management rich.
Holding on to 11% means...its a squeeze get ready!!..
is today the day???
"It's not just Microvast, it's every growth stock, SPAC, deSPAC, everything. Some kind of trading algorithm has obliterated every one of these securities. It's a cycle, and they hit hard this time similar to February through early May. Look at it this way, volume has been low or unremarkable for the last 10 trading days and MVST has gone 11+ to low 7. It hurts but its BS and all you can do to fight is add more or wait out the storm. I think this is a winner and I've cut loose some of my other growth plays to add more Microvast. Hang in there everyone!"
"Another patent granted Oct 12, https://twitter.com/moneysoprano/status/1449880595392237569"
Strong Buying. 12+
Over $8 again! We need to see $10 level soon and build on that.... boy it takes days to make highs and hours to be back below and months of stagflation
High demand to short this stock right now. My broker called me and told me the rate to borrow shares was at 48%
"Do you all realize how short the Ofer Spac market is? As early investors redeem shares, the only place to short since there are not shares to short, are synthetically by using options! Buying puts and selling calls"
Let's take Mvst towards $15 in 2 weeks time!
Can anyone scream and tell me where are we going??....
There you go...!!!...touched highest for the day. Yet to see 12 by 12.
Just crossed the 50 EMA ( 10.83) next stop is 13
I wonder if today's over 14% drop has anything to do with Toyota Motor's announcement about a $13.5B plan to develop EV batteries.
"WARRANTS ARE TOO CHEAp. Last time the stock was here (August), Warrants were $3.40-$3.60. Huge discount here. Buy to $3.25! Math doesn't lie."
"wow, that stoploss fall"
Finally up on this stock! I made on paper $100k by the first three days and have it all back in a week! Loaded the warrants back then and they are finally green again. I need to see $25 on the stock...
"PIPE is not subject to lock up period. Founding members shares: 25% is locked up 1 year and 75% is locked up for 2 years. SPAC and some others only have 6 months.Like many others in this forum, I expressed my concerns regarding the lack of communication time to time from MVST. I believe we need patience as well!"
I am not heavily invested here but i have nice medium size position for my portfolio.. i am going to put these shares in the basement and forget about them until 2025 where everyone needs batteries and the entire world is battery constrained and chinese government decides who gets what raw materials.. who will get preferential treatment? The Japanese and Korean players or this little gem? Why do you think Chinese are pouring into Afghanistan? Their concerns over human rights abuses? Or the incredible mineral riches needed to make batteries? When these factories come online this share price will look silly. This isn't a meme stock at all.. this is a real company laying the foundation to become a real player in the future. If Chinese government picks them to grow it could be big.
Long term investors who hold this stock will be richly rewarded. MVST designs and produces EV batteries has so much potential and it is right in the middle of the EV revolution. EV adoption is much greater in Asia than US and they will sell all the batteries they produce.
It's possible that MVST might be the most volatile stock on the Exchange.
"Covid is almost done especially after the release of the pill to treat covid, not prevent. The impact of that is massive. The logistics in manufacturing and transport because of labor shortages will revert back to normal. I give it another business quarter, 2 at the most before price stabilizes in commodities. Stocks like Microvast will have their time. Not this year but more to the end of the next year. Enjoy the cheap pricing and load up."
Wonder what is wrong with this stock? Nothing wrong. Only matter of proving what is right with it!
"EV is picking up so will MVST. Do not just buy for short squeeze, this should go higher based on the demand for its products."
To the moon?
This stopped to be funny anymore
I need $20 and warrants to be $10
Did anyone see that price action earlier? What gives? I saw it in both my post Spac investments so I think someone was buying baskets of beaten up stocks and post Spacs... both my stocks spiked 5% out of no where and both closed negative to flat. Very odd market dynamics
"$MVST is going to be $SPRT in spades. $MVST regularly gets a borrow rate over 100%, and it is a great investment not just a trade. All you have to do is buy $MVST, and sit on your hands."
Love all the crazy PT speculations I see! Let’s just hope for $25 in the NTM.
"If you look closely at the technical picture, you can see a ""W"" forming...In that case we hit 14 next coming weeks!"
This is the third highest earning stock in my portfolio...expecting this to be at the top by close!!
Is Microvast Holdings Inc (MVST) a Loser in the Industrials Sector? Source: https://goo.io/investorsobserver.com
halted?
No clue why this site keeps deleting my message. One more time: mvst fully diluted shares outstanding is 35.49 based on Eikon. You should learn what diluted shares means since this is real number we consider. Very low shares out and float based on market cap. Easy to manipulate and gamma squeeze off the $15 calls. check out that option volume.
pump it up today 
What is the reason they keep dropping
we'll be heading to 6 if mvst doesn't release any PR soon
Welcome on board. Please fasten your seat belts.
If insiders are not selling then who else are?
yes...that was me market order of 8k at 9.78..thanks guys for the cheap shares.
Finally closed green on a red day!!
Would be nice to be up tomorrow for once.
"Some made fun of me for selling at 14, look where it is now. I'm thinking of entering back soon"
Consolidating
Just wait. In 3 years this thing will be $40
"I just want this to close above 8.30, is that a lot to expect for today?"
Lets start the train to glory!
Poling . Going to 9 give a thumb up going to 6 give a thumb down
this is best in EV battery section with revenue and lot of new contract in pipeline. i am holding for next 12 month and see progress. easy $30-
Here we go!Bad Sept is closing. Mvst should climb back up towards $12Trade accordingly.
We are just a PR / SEC filing away from seeing a real spike!. Shorts have the opportunity now to cover or get burned soon!
Touch 17 in few weeks..good chances before October end
Go Microvast
Check out Digital World Spac warrants for for PT on mvst! $24.50!
"I have held this  since December. Still bag holding at $15. I look a couple times a week hoping this  will go up. No news ever, used to say I would hold till $36. I will dump when it gets to $16"
I am staying far away from MVST - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
"Serious question, not trolling. How does a company that only makes 30m in revenues get a market valuation of 2b?"
Rally happening finally
this is the best in EV battery section with revenue and lots of new contracts- hold on for 5 years and this will be in $100 easy
"Added another 2k...not on margin..I will hold this as long as it is needed. All the best!!..I am too long on this, but its ok."
"Wow! Great to hear Workhorse voluntarily dismissed their own lawsuit against Oshkosh ... And they did it on the 11th hour of the judge's ruling! Makes one think if maybe they got wind of the judges outcome or perhaps agreed to an agreement with Oshkosh for them to pick up the slack if Microvast can't keep up in the filling of all those USPS EV orders for Oshkosh and the USPS or perhaps maybe they will be included in some way on that 6 billion order. After all, it's a massive order in a world with so many other massive commercial EV orders going on and many more coming, which means there should be plenty of room for everybody! According to a article I read, Workhorse said they intend to focus on moving forward with their business plans. So they probably have many other orders to fill anyways. So sounds like a win, win, in my book! It's been a long time a coming for the world to finally go EV in all the transportation segments. Can't wait for the day that every shuttle, bus, semi truck, train and all the cars run on batteries or hydrogen. Gives me hope for humanity, the environment and the planet. Now if we could all get along in this country and give the real and main EV companies some slack, (like they do in Europe without selloffs on headline noise or supply chain disruptions) and start working together towards the inevitable world renewable energy transition and the massive job opportunities it brings. Hey, who knows, maybe it would allow us to keep our EV innovations going on here in the US instead of it moving over to China or Europe, where they embrace their EV startup companies. After all, it's really the future we're talking about."
Going to 10$
I added 2k more again when this was down!!..man..now I have a ton. Should I buy options instead?
11 by 12?
back to 15 soon?
Losing money is so incredibly fun. You learn to enjoy the color red.
As I said last week spacs hearing back up! Risk trade badk on
why is MVST so hated?... Green stocks supposed to be Green today!

Remember when they kept saying as soon as Oshkosh wins the court battle MVST would shoot right up? Remember that? I do. Lol
"Funny, Ford went up yesterday because they stated they will collaborate with SK to make batteries. Meanwhile, we sell off."
Starting to wonder if it will ever get back to 17 again in my lifetime?
Earnings release on November 8th
"% Held by Insiders - 42.72%.This keeps me positive. We'll wait and see in the next couple of Quarterly reports, how much of uptrend it has."
"We shouldn’t be surprised by the stocks performance. Down in a horrible tape! I have reviewed market structure and the “risk off” trades around SPAC’s. Yes they are still deemed a spac until they are not! There was and still is too much puplic supply of new companies and shares in the markets. Spacs have a whole host of market structure issues per merger and post merger. There are early investors selling cheap shares, insider overhang, tons of shorting around the merger deal. Think of like convertible debt hedging. The risk off trade has been on for months now and Spacs are definitely in the bucket of “sell these stocks” to bail out better quality well know names in the portfolio or sell these stocks because the market looks weak. I’m somewhat surprised it held up as well as it did! That’s encouraging. Also the EV trade is hear too stay."
Close over 10 (20SMA) would be strong! Can possibly run to 11+ next week
"Here we come, Just like I was saying$12.50 end of 2 weeks time.That was Approx 2 weeks ago"
consolidating at 7.3-7.8 before the next drop?
"When I look at 6 months charts, I see lot of cup and handles...but the handle seems to be broken now.."
A good indication..crossing above 9
"Lithium iron battery is high demand, it is really good for mvst long run. Go Mvst"
Can someone explain how MVST market cap can still sit around USD 3 bn instead of 30 ?
Warrants seem underpriced at 2.60 compared to other spacs in this price range around 12 no? Thinking of adding another 1000.
"I am holding it tight at 11.00+, but my order is filling up ..why are you guys selling anyways?"
This thing is looking good! Over $12
"Not sure why my post was deleted.I hoped for $12 today. There is so much manipulative practices on spacs based on holders getting out, shorting to facilitate makets, etc"
$40 in 8-10 years...
"Market is turning green, so as MVST...good luck longs"
What a desperate shorting? The short interest went up considerably and stood at 11.8 M shares as of September 15 an increase of 3.5 million shares during last few days! I believe shorts will pay dearly for this greed! I hope MVST will come soon with some positive news and then we will see the fun.
All indications are pointing to 12+
Shady how this goes up every AH and pre and then just grinds down during the day.
"Short interest as of September 30 @14M+ shares (increased from 11M on September 15) and the ￼Price has been affected greatly by shorting! I believe if MVST is building / having 3 plants, it has some basis for building it. Moreover it has more than 1500 employees and expect to have $2B+ revenue in 2025. Therefore we should be fine regardless of current price level!"
"This is the grand dip of all dips, bigger than the big dipper!"
Time to buy folks!
Time to load up again !
Must be speculation that the ticker symbol is similar to Facebook's MVRS.
Literally down every day. Need news and volume.
"By looking at the chart, this will close at green."
Loaded another 8kGood luck all longs!!!..
No matter what the close brings remember it was a day of nice price action and volume! Something is brewing here again! No idea why today but you could see the turn last week and the accumulation. Let’s hope we get to $25 before she reverses again
Get ready for tomorrow!!!...

S1 filed last week. Just a matter of time.
Great price action lately! My warrants are showing life
So we have a large seller this AM. Volume on track to break the 30 day daily average. Hmm
100+ mill revenue in 2021 but a market cap of 3.6B?
We can’t go up regardless of market sentiment
Added a thousand more shares today at $8.07. Think we are at the bottom.
Expect this momentum to continue as there is some news of partnerships. The partnership information is not from Microvast.
Adding on any significant dip.
Something is Brewing. Hold for the Gold. All the thumbs down are from newbies who sold at the all time lows. Hahahahaha
"its under pressure everyday, shorters world now"

"U.S. House plan would give electric vehicles big boost5:33 PM ET 10/29/21 | ReutersU.S. House plan would give electric vehicles big boostBy David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A $1.75 trillion Democratic spending proposal could give a big boost to electric vehicles especially to Detroit's Big Three automakers and the U.S. Postal Service.The House plan boosts electric vehicle credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any credit.The EV tax credits would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years and disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.Foreign automakers have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a big leg up, while the United Auto Workers union strongly supports it.Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions representing assembly workers in the United States and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.Honda said in a letter Friday ""this tax credit plan would pit Americans working for the three 'legacy' companies against the American workers of other automakers.""The bill would award $6 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase electric delivery vehicles and infrastructure. USPS said Friday it estimates under the bill ""all delivery fleet acquisitions could feasibly be electric by 2028, and a corresponding 70% of our entire delivery fleet by"" 2030.In February, USPS awarded a 10-year contract to Oshkosh Defense, a subsidiary of Oshkosh, to build a mix of internal combustion and EV delivery vehicles that could be worth$6 billion.The EV proposal eliminates phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible, along with Tesla.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm defended the decision to exclude Tesla from the higher credit, telling CNBC: ""We want to make sure that we do everything possible to encourage that business and labor really focus on elevating the standards for everyday Americans.""The bill would create a new electric bike and three-wheel vehicle tax credit, a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles and $4,000 used EV tax credit.It would authorize $3.5 billion for ""domestic manufacturing conversion"" grants for electric and other green vehicles and provide $3 billion to boost a U.S. loan program to retool existing auto plants to build more fuel efficient models and expand it to cover zero-emission trains, airplanes, boats and Hyperloop technology.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Aurora Ellis)"
"Oshkosh contract is legit. Big gains coming here, MVST is primarily selected supplier for UPS order fulfillment. GL"
Will this be the master of all squeezes?
ZF Mobility seems to be using mvst batteries. ZF products are used by many in the auto industry. I think it is huge! Let’s see what news we get from MVST.
NO SPACS FOR ME AGAIN
Are we going to see another 50 cents up today?
"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/2413524/quantumscape-vs-microvast-which-electric-vehicle-battery-stock-is-a-better-investment""The company’s management expects revenue to grow between 35% and 44% in 2021 while Wall Street forecasts sales at $143.53 million this year. Analysts also expect sales to grow by 79% to $257 million in 2022.Microvast continues to reinvest in business expansion projects that include building new production facilities and allocating funds for research and development. The company claims it has secured over $1.5 billion in contracts through 2027 and forecasts sales to touch $2.3 billion by 2025."""
Hold hold hold lot more is coming
"Does anyone think that Ford's and GM's recently announced plans to build plants to make their own battering is hurting MVST? Seems to me there will still be plenty of demand for batteries from other EV manufacturers, especially considering we are in its infancy."
What is this volume about? Christ
Chalking this up to heated spacs like Digital and all the gamblers moving over there today!
"Slow but sure! Not bad compare today, given that most Techs are red"
Why won’t they post my message?
"So making the connections because that’s what I do, the controlling stake/D filing by Ashmore is related to Craig Webster who is a Director at MVST. Craig came from Ashmore, a manager on the special situations funds he was on their investment committee! All makes sense."
