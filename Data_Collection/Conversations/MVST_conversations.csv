"It's not just Microvast, it's every growth stock, SPAC, deSPAC, everything. Some kind of trading algorithm has obliterated every one of these securities. It's a cycle, and they hit hard this time similar to February through early May. Look at it this way, volume has been low or unremarkable for the last 10 trading days and MVST has gone 11+ to low 7. It hurts but its BS and all you can do to fight is add more or wait out the storm. I think this is a winner and I've cut loose some of my other growth plays to add more Microvast. Hang in there everyone!"
This stopped to be funny anymore
is today the day???
$40 ? TWO YEARS MAX.
Earnings release on November 8th
Nic pre market price action. Will it hold? Do we see $10 soon? The stock has been seeing some action lately
"I just want this to close above 8.30, is that a lot to expect for today?"
Rally happening finally
This is the second time in a week that I spoke to MVST IR. Basically I was venting out. Of course their reaction as usual was compliance to SEC regulations. But I reminded them that it is all about management that matters and explained some of the companies that faced tough times and how the management changed the challenges into opportunities! Basically I reminded the IR speak to the management to speak to investors what they will do and do what they speak as there is a concern now about the management resulting from the merger execution delays and revenue and bottom line mishaps! At the end of each call I was told they will convey my message to the management. Our Expression to IR may be a storm in the coffee cup but thought do it anyway!

"Short interest as of September 30 @14M+ shares (increased from 11M on September 15) and the ï¿¼Price has been affected greatly by shorting! I believe if MVST is building / having 3 plants, it has some basis for building it. Moreover it has more than 1500 employees and expect to have $2B+ revenue in 2025. Therefore we should be fine regardless of current price level!"
"Market is turning green, so as MVST...good luck longs"
Just wait. In 3 years this thing will be $40
Are we going to see another 50 cents up today?
"Last hour was incredible, awesome!!"
$15 by January 2022
"A short squeeze could be possible today. Especially, Last one hour may be interesting."
Go Microvast
Long term investors who hold this stock will be richly rewarded. MVST designs and produces EV batteries has so much potential and it is right in the middle of the EV revolution. EV adoption is much greater in Asia than US and they will sell all the batteries they produce.
We are red on green market
To the moon?
"Earnings are expected on November 8 or latest by Nov 14. If the earnings are a beat from their forecast, we will see betterment of prices depending on by how much it beat the guidance. If results are just on the expected level or less then the price may go down further. In the meantime shorts are adding to their positions. As of Oct 15 the short interest is around 15.8 million shares vs 14.X Million on September 30. So far shorts are winning! I look forward to a better earnings from MVST in q3! Can we get it?"
Someone sold and I loaded a ton!!..thanks guys ..have a wonderful weekend.
"Does anyone think that Ford's and GM's recently announced plans to build plants to make their own battering is hurting MVST? Seems to me there will still be plenty of demand for batteries from other EV manufacturers, especially considering we are in its infancy."
Great price action lately! My warrants are showing life
$40 in 8-10 years...
"One of the listed company tickers below makes far more profit than all the other companies combined, derives fully one fourth of its revenue from lithium (amounting to one fifth of the world's lithium market), and gets another third of its revenue from specialty fertilizers (a market which has been on fire just like lithium). Furthermore, this company has zero net debt and is growing its already big profits year over year at a 65% clip. And yet its stock still trades at a 17 forward P/E and has gone completely unnoticed by Wall Street and the retail investor lithium mania.

"U.S. House plan would give electric vehicles big boost5:33 PM ET 10/29/21 | ReutersU.S. House plan would give electric vehicles big boostBy David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A $1.75 trillion Democratic spending proposal could give a big boost to electric vehicles especially to Detroit's Big Three automakers and the U.S. Postal Service.The House plan boosts electric vehicle credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any credit.The EV tax credits would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years and disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.Foreign automakers have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a big leg up, while the United Auto Workers union strongly supports it.Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions representing assembly workers in the United States and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.Honda said in a letter Friday ""this tax credit plan would pit Americans working for the three 'legacy' companies against the American workers of other automakers.""The bill would award $6 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase electric delivery vehicles and infrastructure. USPS said Friday it estimates under the bill ""all delivery fleet acquisitions could feasibly be electric by 2028, and a corresponding 70% of our entire delivery fleet by"" 2030.In February, USPS awarded a 10-year contract to Oshkosh Defense, a subsidiary of Oshkosh, to build a mix of internal combustion and EV delivery vehicles that could be worth$6 billion.The EV proposal eliminates phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible, along with Tesla.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm defended the decision to exclude Tesla from the higher credit, telling CNBC: ""We want to make sure that we do everything possible to encourage that business and labor really focus on elevating the standards for everyday Americans.""The bill would create a new electric bike and three-wheel vehicle tax credit, a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles and $4,000 used EV tax credit.It would authorize $3.5 billion for ""domestic manufacturing conversion"" grants for electric and other green vehicles and provide $3 billion to boost a U.S. loan program to retool existing auto plants to build more fuel efficient models and expand it to cover zero-emission trains, airplanes, boats and Hyperloop technology.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Aurora Ellis)"

Finally closed green on a red day!!
I am simply stunned by the companies lack of informing its investors of future endeavours. Not a like of news in several months? I am truly regretting putting my money here. These spacs really stink. You buy into concepts to make management rich.
get the pr get the news get a new pr team I just want to see this going up from now on
"any chance anyone here lives near the old AKEBONO brake plant that MICROVAST bought ??? ... The address is:780 International Blvd Clarksville, TN 37040 .... I am curious if there is truly any activity spooling up there yet. it is a pretty big plant that originally (according to the news) was to have about 300 MVST employees.... I do think its way early for manufacturing at this site, but curious if they even are occupying the building or starting to do any remodeling to the brake and auto parts assembly lines that were left behind by AKEBONO."
Shorting fee costs some 100+% recently on some platforms..how is it working out shorts?
"Lithium iron battery is high demand, it is really good for mvst long run. Go Mvst"
"Someone posted about Microvast/Apple connection a few months ago, anyone remember who it was? They apparently knew of meetings. Whether its true or not is unknown but i'd like to hear what the person has to say on the progress."
anyone know why MVST is up almost 8% in after hours?
