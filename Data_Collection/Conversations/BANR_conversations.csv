Banner sold their Utah branches and are closing 4 branches next week.It certainly looks like Banner has found a buyer.I predict Zions.See my post below for reasoning.Don't own shares but may buy some if there is a stiff market correction or if tax reform passes.
What the hell happened today
"Wells Fargo reported a brutal quarter.All the regional banks will do the same.Banner may need to cut the dividend and there will be lots of consolidation in this space.I continue to favor a merger with Zions.I also like a merger with Umpqua.And Amazon taking out Banner is not out of the question either.They bought the brick and mortar Whole Foods.Meanwhile,Banner will likely close a bunch of stores/branches as it prepares itself to be bought out."
Two great days. I assume the year end is better then expected. Thoughts. Merger in works
