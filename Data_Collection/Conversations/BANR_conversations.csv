What's going on with Banner?
"Amazon is predicted to buy a small or medium sized bank in 2018,today's headline read.Hmmmmm....Amazon is based in Seattle and Banner is based in Walla Walla."
Look for Zions Bank to buy out Banner.Hedge fund appointed ex-Zions CFO to Banner board.

Anyone out there who can comment on banner please
Banner sold their Utah branches and are closing 4 branches next week.It certainly looks like Banner has found a buyer.I predict Zions.See my post below for reasoning.Don't own shares but may buy some if there is a stiff market correction or if tax reform passes.

"Wells Fargo reported a brutal quarter.All the regional banks will do the same.Banner may need to cut the dividend and there will be lots of consolidation in this space.I continue to favor a merger with Zions.I also like a merger with Umpqua.And Amazon taking out Banner is not out of the question either.They bought the brick and mortar Whole Foods.Meanwhile,Banner will likely close a bunch of stores/branches as it prepares itself to be bought out."
