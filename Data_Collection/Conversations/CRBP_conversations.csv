"Something big must be about to happen, options for 9/18 are super expensive."
"This is my first and last adventure with experimental drug company stocks, learned a sharp lesson."
Smells very fishy around here
"The FDA is letting Corbus set there own guide lines of the Phase 3 trails , which is exactly like the the Phase 11 trail quide lines.IT is a slam dunk for the FDA approval here."
"This stock is a gamble, positive news in the pipeline could skyrocket the stock, but the opposite could bring the value back to one dollar."
What’s holding this stock up? FDA shot both legs off yet we still stand. We’ll take it of course . Maybe we’ll get a surprise ….
Well it's been a few days now since the SA hit piece and as far as I can tell institutional investors who own almost 50% of corbus are not selling in droves. Surely they would be if there was any validity to these charges?
Anyone else holding from 3$ abs waiting for the day Zack Morris tweets that he’s bullish on this stock? Cuz same!
We need some meat and potato news. News to sink our teeth in. Solid news. News with results . CASI come on . A lot of share holders been with you 20+ years. Come on we’re waiting……
"Here's what I see. They hovered between $6 and $9 for a good portion of a decade. They took swift and decisive action after that last study came out. They have other studies being made public in early November, that by their reactions after the last trial, they seemed pretty excited about. They have other products in the pipeline. They have a study on how it effects COVID, which has multiple inflammation style problems and they make anti-inflammatory medicine. I think anyone who didn't buy at $1 per share may wish they had."
Honest question...been in for awhile on CRBP @ $8.38 /4160 shares. Should I hold or take my cover and run?
"Great news on Corbus 4001 (Rimonabant) as the NIH will handle the Blood, Brain Barrier testing which should be finalized 3 months after Corbus files phase1, sometime in the next 5-6 months. Readout should be about 3 months after or next summer at the latest. Corbus continues to expand it’s sales and marketing team with some impressive new hires. Remember all of Corbus’ fda trials are on fast track, so phase 3 results are liable to be expedited due to the redundancy of the testing and the ongoing phase 2 trials. Lots of emphasis on possible joint ventures in the future. Nice to see the Kakan revenues show up this quarter."
We need some positive news ASAP. I’ve emailed PR and hope to hear something back.
I just bought 12000 shares
"Biotech stocks awaiting trial results are like Roulette- if the trial works the stock can rise 10x or more, if it doesn't and it's the only product it can lose 90% of it's value. The upcoming results will tell all."
"Corbus patent reinforces exclusivity assumptions, says Raymond JamesRaymond James analyst Laura Chico noted that Corbus' new method of use patent for the treatment of fibrotic diseases marks the third method patent extending exclusivity to 2034, which she sees as ""encouraging on the margin."" The patent issuance reinforces her assumption that Corbus can hold exclusivity for lenabasum through 2034, added Chico, who keeps an Outperform rating on the stock."
"I read the press release and better understand results. Net-Net: the 20mg pill, 2x daily, improved Dermatomyositis (DM) patient outcomes (for real, in patients already receiving traditional treatments) after both 28 weeks & 52 weeks. It improved all groups (muscle weakness and skin inflammation rashes), but did much better for those only suffering sometimes disfiguring skin rashes (with no muscle weakness).The p-test values range from 0.19 to 0.01 (which means this was most likely not random chance).CEO said they have enough cash to continue, and will present data at medical conference(s) and meet with the FDA on next steps. This looks like pretty good news and gives hope to the 80k people suffering from DM in NA, EU and Japan. They need a new & better treatment than those available today.I am long $CRBP after the Chicago Quantum Net Score picked this stock about a month ago in the top 10 list, and more recently as a top-3 pick."
"The stock dips on Friday, 5 insider stock buys in 2 days....right before the Oppenheimer Conference, which CRBP presents at on Tuesday.. Coincidence? Up from here."
"Regular people drive the markets now (well plus algos and dark pools anyway) not institutional investors. Most people probably don't know to listen to the call, and if they did probably wouldn't know it was generally good news. I'm not too worried. The people in the know will start buying now that they know it's stable till 2022 at least, and that their next study is accelerated to 2021. I said before, it's not gonna be a rocket, but I believe it will go up."
"What do the analysts know that put the low, average and high price of this stock at 17 25 32 respectively?"
Fnancials are out. Corbus expects to have enough money till second quarter of 2022. And will shortened the Phase 3 dermatomyositis trial to 28 weeks from 52 weeks. CRBP will go up from now
Strong on strong volume. I have to admit $2 is a possibility soon

Be patient guys. This will be a blockbuster
"If this is not the bottom it has to be close. They have enough operating cash for a year and other things in the pipeline. It feels over sold, but who knows!"
I think after the results come out there will be a buyout at a very high price. Remember they have 700 possible drugs in the works.

"If you check the earnings estimates for the rest of this year, plus next, CRBP is projected to burn through about $200 million. They have about $50M on hand. So they need to raise around $150M over the next 18 months, via partnership payments, grants, and dilutive actions, such as issuing more stock. My concern is that this company is not expected to be cash flow positive for years. And yes, I know this reality check will garner lots of thumbs down, and accusations of being short the stock. I am actually long, and this is the fourth biggest position in my portfolio, out of 11 stocks."
What does this company have that makes it any sense to own the stock. I cant find one reason
Why is this CO going up? The I missed any news?
Anytime the CFO dumps all his stocks there is nothing else you need to know if that’s true.
Waiting for it to double up in a weeks time
3 new inside buys filed on the 15th
I can’t believe the pps is this high. 2 time loser would think it would be 50 cents . So what does that say? IDK. So far they have nothing but some drugs they bought that have value . I already lost a ton of money but reinvested much lower hoping that this past report would spike the pps. Strike two.

theres a new job post for supply chain director... https://www.corbuspharma.com/careers/job-opportunities
"Corbus investors should not assume dilution is imminent (though of course it could be) nor a certainty. Remember Kakem Pharmaceuticals in Japan was so impressed with Lenabasum that Kakem paid Corbus $27MM upfront for the commercial rights to 2 indications (for a patient population of 37,000 in Japan). Do the math yourself it comes to $730/patient (just the upfront payment). This was negotiated in Q4 2018 when Corbus only had Phase 2 data.If Corbus is able to secure a commercial partner in the EU or China, on the same Kakem per patient terms, Corbus could command $80MM+ from an EU partner and/or $150MM+ from a China partner. With Phase 3 data maybe Corbus could do even better than they did with Kakem. Don’t forget Lenabasum has 4 potential indications as well. Again dilution is possible but it is not necessarily a certainty. Our analysis concludes, with positive Phase 3 top-line data, Corbus May never need a financing again. This is the primary reason professional analysts have these $40 price targets.CRPB’s CFO said CRBP had enough cash to take CRBP into Q4 2020. We do not believe CRBP would wait so late to raise money. We believe (but of course don’t know for sure) CRBP would be so irresponsible and hence believe commercial partnership announcements are imminent. Should CRPB receive enough upfront payments to never need a dilution, our analysis concludes CRBP will eventually trade for at least 2 times peak Lenabasum SSc US revenues & 1 times ex-US SSc revenues. This is roughly $2.5Billion.Good luck whatever your position."
"Gentlemen, on Friday CRBP will be at $ 15, an early partnership with a major pharmaceutical company. Remember this message. So the CEO buys more shares. He already said it at the conference with Jefferies. Visit the company page and I listened to the audio of the last two conferences. Greetings and buy more shares of CRBP and keep your shares."
"CRBP had $46.6 million cash on hand as of 3/31/2020 after issuing 7.7 million shares of its common stock at $6/share (raising a gross $46 million) in February 2020. CRBP has no, as in $0, debt. Q1 2020 cash operating expenses were just under $30 million (75% R&D and 25% SG&A) more or less consistent with FY2019 quarterly operating expenses (noted below).

"Why 20% higher in after hours? I own 3,000 shares around $5. I risked BK when the news hit but I can afford the hit. It was possible that CRBP could rise again on good news so I held.

New presentation from the annual meeting shows exciting news on Corbus 4001 describing multiple filing strategies in addition to NASH. This was mentioned in the fireside chat and can assume will be covered further in today’s 7pm Eastern conference call. Availablenow on the website.
DEA just rescheduled epidiolex made by GW pharmaceuticals from a schedule 1 to a 5. If this doesn’t make you reconsider CORBUS as a long term play I don’t know what else will.
In plain ordinary words I’ve taken from Corbus report is “ We have nothing’
with today's trading there is no gap down but still a nice up opened
3X daily volume in an hourPeople are buying as fast as it’s sold.
Some very positive. news on marijuana and autism on Corbus’ twitter site. This time you need THC and break the blood-brain barrier for results. Lots of money to add research or buy it.
It’s worth buying Corbus pharmaceuticals at this price 1.02 any suggestion please
Oppenheimer initiated with an outperform rating an $28 pt
"My thoughts on this stock over the last couple of years are that people with deep pockets worked tirelessly and effectively in keeping this stock between about $5-$8 a share so they could accumulate over that span. Then, a couple weeks ago the Seekjng Alpha hit job article comes out and the stock drops again. Then 10 insider buys in 2-3 days right before the Oppenheimer presentation. It is my belief that “special interests” close to this stock have accumulated the shares they wanted at the price they fought hard to keep down over 2 years. I am frankly surprised that no one has even suggested that the Seekjng Alpha article actually helped insiders get increased positions at lower cost. Could it have been an inside hit job? IMHO, all you have to do is “follow the money” and make your own opinion. The cat is out of the bag and the stock breaks out from here. Don’t short this things IMHO"

Fingers crossed for positive phase 3 results... then to the moon 
Re S-8 filing. There were 6 inside buys on the day before the filing. The prior similar filing in 2014 resulted in 2 sales by a 10% holder in 2014 and 15 and 90plus buys. It is a formality filing in case anyone need cash to buy a house or transfer shares to grandchildren etc. Not a big deal. Today’s stories on SLE and ALS are far more important. Stay focused.
Hopefully the earnings are good and can make this stock run to 3$ I’m praying!
Holding bag at $8.6. For as long as the ponzie scheme continues. Doubling down....not for weed. Good luck longs.
Someday.. it will skyrocket just like AMC
better limit buys on this stock tooinsiders are losing better change rules again
What’s with the constant barrage of law suits against Corbus ?? Everyday . I get it but once or twice a day???? That only means that they think it’s really going to take off...
So I'm pretty sure that positive conversation with Cramer will help this company tomorrow.
Thank you CRBP. Nice to have one item in my portfolio that isn't red today.
I spent my entire career in the pharmaceutical industry. I have never seen such a profound discrepancy between a Phase 2 study outcome and the recent Phase 3 study. It's like they flubbed up and gave placebos to all three groups in the study. I expect lawsuits to start coming very soon.
There are only 2 reasons why a stock goes up. Good news and more good news . Expecting both soon

Corbus Pharmaceuticals (CRBP) also seeing an increase in analyst action this week after posting its Q1 results yesterday. Oppenheimer assigned a new Buy rating and $28 price target on Corbus yesterday. H.C. Wainwright does the same today with a $24 price target. This small biotech concern currently trades for just less than seven bucks a share.
"Corbus Pharmaceuticals said to have reported an update on late-stage lenabasum trial progress. This could be a great achievement!

Lots of big buys today! Every time there is a big buy the price starts to rise again. This could keep going AH and premarket
"Do the research like Fidelity does. They are the biggest and the best at what they do.

"Presenting at Oppenheimer’s Annual Health Care Conference next Tuesday. Earnings tomorrow pre-market. Good chance for us to gain some ground back, and even possibly reach a new high, given Corbus presents good news. I assume they must have good things to say if they want to present at the Conference."
Will this stock ever get back to 3$? Past charts show jumps in month of September hopefully we get that jump like previous years and it gets to 3$

"Corbus is my only stock (I own more than 30) with a green technical chart in the short, middle and long run. Has 9 analyst buy ratings and brought out only good news.

"bad news.Topline data showed no significant differences in the primary and secondary endpoints when comparing lenabasum to placebo, both added to background drug therapy.For the primary endpoint, the median American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index for Systemic Sclerosis (ACR CRISS) scores at Week 52 were 0.887 in the placebo arm and 0.888 in the lenabasum 20 mg twice daily arm. ACR CRISS is a composite endpoint that reflects the probability of patient improvement. The maximum achievable ACR CRISS score is 1.0.RESOLVE-1 is the first 52-week, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial that tested the efficacy and safety of lenabasum in 365 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc in a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, with dosing of lenabasum at 20 mg twice daily, lenabasum at 5 mg twice daily, or placebo twice daily for 52 weeks. The majority of enrolled patients (84%) were receiving background immunosuppressive drugs, reflecting recent trends in clinical practice.Similar proportions of placebo-treated and lenabasum-treated subjects had at least one treatment emergent adverse event (AEs), 86.2% in the placebo arm and 91.7% in the lenabasum 20 mg twice daily arm. Serious AEs occurred in 14.6% of subjects in the control arm and 9.2% of subjects in the lenabasum 20 mg twice daily arm. Severe AEs occurred in 13% of subjects in the control arm and 5.8% of subjects in the lenabasum arm. No subjects receiving lenabasum withdrew from the study because of an AE-related to study drug. Lenabasum treatment was well-tolerated in this study. No evidence of lenabasum-related immunosuppression or new safety signals for lenabasum were observed.Further analyses of these data are underway, and once Corbus has a fuller understanding of the data, the Company would like to engage with the FDA to determine potential next steps in this clinical development program. The data will be presented at upcoming medical conferences.Yuval Cohen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Corbus said, “We are surprised and deeply disappointed that the RESOLVE-1 trial did not meet its primary endpoint. I would like to extend my gratitude to the participants in the study and the clinical staff at the study sites, as well as to the Corbus employees, for their hard work and dedication. We now look forward to upcoming topline results from our study of lenabasum in patients with cystic fibrosis.”"

Looking for a buyout before it hits the big time with the library of compounds all geared toward knocking down inflammation in the endocannabanoid business and I think it could wind up being a good bet going forward...
to help with financial statements.. the management are crooks. stock inst going anywhere but in toilet. CFO cashed out all his shares last year at 8-9 bucks before went to a dollar stock. pipeline has nothing...
load it up. I believe this coming data will be positive. This drug is already help to reduce pain and they only assess pain for primary endpoint for this phase 2. It will pop up to 3 on this coming data. Just filled at 1.48 and hold until Lupus data readout. This data has 75% chance for being positive + short interest is down

why is there 3.6 million shares trading after hours today
could someone explain why there is little or no response to all these potential lawsuits. Also why there is still upgrades to the stock during this period. I once owned a stock BOFI now AXOS that was in a similar position. It took more than year and then they got resolved of illegal practices. Stock went from my price of 18 to 45 over the next year or so. Wondering if this could be the same thing.
well see
As long as it stays in the 6 s Im going to keep adding shares. Up to 60K shares. Any one have more then that here?just couscous..
"Although lenabasum failed the primary endpoint for diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (Ssc), it won't stop Corbus from further pursuing it. And like it or not, they will probably, even certainly, receive more funding from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to do so.My understanding speaking to Investor Relations is that patients in the experimental group of study were ALREADY taking other remedies for underlying conditions, and this may have masked the difference between the experimental group and the control (placebo) group. Also, there were some groups of patients that appearrd to have benefited from the treatment and these matters are currently being investigated and it will be ongoing for the next six months. Finally, Corbus will continue to pursue lenabasum for OTHER INDICATIONS, SPECIFICALLY: erythematosus (1st half of 2021) and dermatomytositis (approximately 1-year time frame).G / L everyone."
"I know other people out there get paid much more than Dr. Cohen, but after reading the 8-K, I'm still in awe, especially where he gets a one-year severance and COBRA coverage to cover the one-year non-compete requirement following his termination. Seems like a pretty nice gig."
I think company a con and CEO salary excessive and CFO a #$%$
I will buy and hold when market opens tomorrow.
"My bet is any positive results on their CB1 Inverse Agonist Program. A metabolism treatment for weight loss. It works in obese mice. If it works, this stock will go to the roof."
March 12 - operational and financial results via conf call
did you read it? the guy predicted Phase-3 fail back in July!!! https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corbus-pharmaceuticals-doubtful-future-lenabasum-mehdi-mehdiyev/
wonder if they cut out more salaries and be able to pay rent ?a
"The excerpt is from Corbus's November 2019 release. Just re-posting for the benefit of the message board. G / L !“The persistently favorable safety profile and durable improvement in efficacy outcomes, with over 2 years of dosing in these OLEs, support our optimism that the Phase 3 SSc study will show positive data in summer 2020. We interpret the durable improvement in multiple efficacy outcomes as an indicator showing totality of benefit for these diseases. The high rate of subject retention in these OLEs speaks to the enthusiasm of both the patients and their physicians for lenabasum as a potential treatment for SSc and DM. We are deeply grateful to the patients, physicians and site staff participating in these studies,” said Barbara White, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research for the Company."
"Raymond James reiterates Outperform, with a $22 price target May 10th. All clinical efforts on track."
Slide presentation on strategic plan
"I’m hoping for a buyout...they could be picked up for cheap now by an international company, if their pipeline looks at all interesting"
"This will pop, split, and rocket once the trial results are published and money is made"
What’s holding this up? They have nothing … pps should be .75 .
I have a feeling that the recent jump in implied volatility is to do the options market and people cutting their loses now expecting a big jump in price. Let’s hope we can keep the forward momentum
Just bought more - take advantage of the dip!
God hep America
24$ price target
Next Wednesday news- hopefully!
"We're looking at more of the same tomorrow. Mark my words. Have been through short attacks with others. I see it now as an opportunity. My stop loss for half of my holdings hit this morning, and I'm just waiting now for the safe place to double down. It has worked well for me with CRON, APHA, and others. I've set my stop loss, cringed when it hits, then got back in when others are fearful. It's taken years for me to recognize the pattern. I'm a hold long kind of investor. It's working for me to set a strict stop loss, feel the disappointment when it sells, then get back in when it's awful. Don't wait until the dust settles. Prepare to get your second half back in when nobody else feels ready."
"You guys don't really think these kinds of price movements are a coincidence, do you? Its done this this whole past week, losing money during trading hours, then recovering it's losses after hours. Most regular traders don't have access to after hours trading, but market makers sure do.https://photos.app.goo.gl/eNnWZMe53K5EUwYT6"
Sean Moran the CFO cooking the books as he has done ... he dump all his stock last year ... Buyer beware of this stock and CFO that should be arrested.
"I was invested in Corbus all the way up to June and July.I sold my entire position in $7-$8 range and sold all my call options for September at the same time.Why? When you see 100% Buy ratings from all the analysts and a date to report top line data in the summer of 2020 with 'very promising' phase 2 safety and efficacy results, the FIRST thing you should do is be EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS.The stock market has taught me over a lifetime that no one on Wall Street is going to set you up for success then actually drop success in you lap. If they're giving you free advice, it's always because they want to DUMP their shares to you and make you a bag holder.My intuition was telling me all along that lenabasum was a FAILURE in THIS PARTICULAR indication.Will it be a success in a different indication? Time will tell. However, let this be a lesson that Wall Street has no heart and no soul.G / L everyone."
"Short Float of around 20%. Once the shorts start covering we should see a pop in price. First to 2.50, then 3, then around 4.30."
"Companies come and go all the time, this one has gone…."
Knoll bought a little under 5M shares and seems to be behind the recent pop. All things being equal I believe the stock will trade down toward the low $7 range barring any news and do not expect a big pop to say $10-$13 until we either get some phase III data or we get new large investment or news.For me I am a longer term holder because the current results from the various trials have been more than positive. That said I carry both a core holding and a trading portion of stock the latter of which I sold into the bump and have reduced my cost below $4. Anyone arguing my position should look at the historical stock price chart. This thing has a lot up and down moves providing a lot of opportunity and trade.I'm neither a pumper or a shorter. Just a money driven investor. Best of luck to all.
"Looooong time holder of CRBP..But, can anyone tell me anything to make me feel good about this right now?"
"Looks like price control got out of hand. MM's stepped back in to keep it at $1. You can see it every day that it opens around $1 and closes around $1. When it loses during market hours to gain back loses after hours, or vice versa. I think it's going to continue to dance between $.90 and $1.10 until the conference. Then there's going to be a rush of transactions milliseconds after news is announced, which way depends on good news or bad news. I'm hoping good news."
Great time to average down
CRBP Chief medical officer buys over 300k shares
Glad I bought more yesterday. Increasing my position. It should go to $9 in couple of weeks. BUY and HOLD. easy 3x or 4x
CF Foundation wouldn't pour 20+million into the study if they didn't have some faith in it working out. The good news is us shareholders will not be paying for it. Says alot
all of my positions had such a strong start to the day and then the gains just evaporated

CRBP to the moon we will see positive results 2 weeks from now Mark this post we will pass 2$ In two weeks.
"We got it all going on here. Twice the average daily volume.... 75% institutional ownership.... small float... 15+/- million shares short..... and big option activity, today. Lions and tiger and bears, Oh My!! The perfect storm. Thinking we may see $5.00 by this Friday. Let's go!!"
"Hey Lor...how ya doin dear? How many shares did you wind up selling? Just curious, if you're willing to share that sensitive information! I will happily go on the record as a small time investor, who believes whole heartedly in what's about to come to light, unless we are all terribly mistaken, it is more likely than not, that the imminent top line data results are going to propel us forward and not backward, and so although there is but a tiny bit of time left to get on this ride, before the highly anticipated surge of the stock price per share occurs, if you have truly decided to stay behind, please don't forget to write and let the rest of us know how you're doing along the way, once this news hits the airwaves, ok? See Ya Darlin' or are you a ""Sir""? Either way, no worries Lor! Toodaloo!Eddie warmly"
Like my CRBP pain wasn’t enough yet.. I’m down 49.7%
I would not get bogged down by the earnings miss of this stock. They are in the critical development stage of a potentially game changer drug. The pure potential of this stock outweighs an earnings miss
another bad result with very good results in prior phase. Something is wrong here
Little rocket rides are often followed by larger rocket rides on day 2Nice chart
Bought way too high at around 9 a few months ago. I was up big then lost everthing and kept it... should I still keep and wait
"I will continue buying the dips! This is exactly what we all knew would happen! They are trying to shake the long positions out with scare tactics at the open! Great opportunity here. Stocks go up and down, everyone got spoiled over the past weeks with immediate gains everyday, that is not reality. Buy and hold discounted stocks and we will all reach our desired result."
"Why the selling? Don't people realize that huge blocks of shares were bought by big money at higher prices than this. If you wanna sell wait till tomorrow or the next day when its above 2.50. Unless your day trading, its really weak to sell AH at this price."
Manipulated
"If the News is good we will double...Shares Short (Aug 14, 2020) 4 16.01M"

"Watch the insider buying report. My bet is it will continue to be 100% positive. All buyers, no sellers! This company is overdue for a big announcement. I say a partnership is in the works. This is a good price to buy."

This ceo is full of it.
No reason CRBP can't go below cash value of .85. They have nothing to show since their big wipeout. In one day they went from $10 to $2 and then to >$1. JMHO
CFO Moran dumped all his stock last year... what does that tell you?
"Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $125 million as of March 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company raised $58.9 million in net proceeds from the Company’s ATM facility.The $125 million of cash and investments on hand, as of March 31, 2021, is expected to fund operations into the first quarter of 2024, based on the current planned expenditures."
"Wow, CRBP is on the Yolo ETF fund. So much potential as I am sure the hedge fund managers at the http://billion.market/YOLO_Fund are keeping track of all the developments with the company. Yolo currently holds about $ 1477480.5 in shares now. I enjoy following their holdings and looking through their portfolio to see if I can figure out their strategy If you are interested, you can see the details of the holdings from here as that is where I pulled them from. https://www.advisorshares.com/fund/yolo"
Which results come first in aug? Earnings or clinical trials?
CFO Sean Moran dumped all his stock in 2020... what does that tell you ?still there collecting a salary

A big move in premarket is often followed by a crash once market opens.
