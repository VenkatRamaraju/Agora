Managed to pick up another $5000 on the close. Got an instant fill which was nice. The spread sometimes is wide on this stock
"I don't think the base metal holdings of Newmont are thought of very much, but should be. Copper prices realized in 1st 6 months were 95% (not a misprint) higher than 1st 6 months of 2021 ($4.30/pound). Today copper hitting close to all time highs in the $4.70's area. Newmont one of few gold miners to greatly expand into base metals."
"What a discount picked up another 5,000 shares this morning. Gold prices are going to go up in the next 6 months"
My downward price target is $52.24 than upside!
"I see NEM has joined the Blame-the-Covid crowd. You know, when poorly managed companies look for a convenient excuse these days. Some companies manage to execute well and don't need to blame a coronavirus. The others hop on this boat."
"Gold bloodbath continues uninterrupted, led by piece is sheet Newmont. Will the last ""gold bug"" please turn out the lights?"
"… NEM should buy KGC!! October’s chart for KGC & GDXU were 45 degrees, left to right until today’s final trading day for October and fiscal year end tax loss selling for most mutual fund distributions that will take place in December.Today’s wage inflation scare caused a sell off in treasuries (which settle in dollars) and a hawkish sell off in gold on higher rate fears, but the longer term trend is still intact for gold (since 2017) Will 2022 be the year gold breaks through the $2000 barrier and doesn’t look back, as long as inflation outpaces long term interest rates, golds uptrend should remain intact.The miners, however, will need to continue to consolidate as production from existing mines continue to be depleted and input costs rise, with synergy savings on cost of production and HQ Mgt again in sight for the majors.How much in synergies cost savings would Barrick or Newmont gain from an acquisition of KGC and it’s 2.5M +/- oz production add-on … NEM’s annual production would increase from 6M to 8.5M oz’s immediately … and all they need to do is issue shares at about 15% of NEM’s current share price."
NEM missed by 15% or as I like to say the analysts over estimated by 15%. Big deal. Next earnings could be far better. Still a bargain compared to the general market.
"Not bad, I'm short about 50,000 shares:)"
"Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders was $(8) million or $(0.01) per diluted share, a decrease of $619 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to the loss recognized on the pending sale of the Conga mill assets of $571 million, lower average realized gold prices, lower gold sales volumes, unrealized losses on marketable and other equity securities, higher CAS and higher reclamation and remediation charges. These decreases were partially offset by lower income tax expense and lower impairment of long-lived assets.Adjusted net income4 was $483 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $697 million or $0.86 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments to third quarter net income include the loss recognized on the pending sale of the Conga mill assets, changes in the fair value of investments, reclamation and remediation charges and valuation allowance and other tax adjustments.Adjusted EBITDA5 decreased 21 percent to $1,316 million for the quarter, compared to $1,663 million for the prior year quarter."
"Man, I sold a ton of Puts today and my position is still largely short. Happy to lock in some of the gains of the last couple days though."
For every $100 in the GOLD priceNewmont gets $400 in sales per year$2000 gold= $800 million$3000 gold= $4 Billion more
"Newmont 3.8% dividend.... Bloomberg...“Gold’s Inflation-Haven Appeal Means ‘Violent’ Run-Up May Be Ahead”Garofalo expects gold to reach $3,000 in matter of monthsMcEwen sticks with $5,000 long-term call as currencies debase"
As global mining for gold and other precious metals decline prices will go higher. Supply and demand. This will be an offset to lower production. Gold will be over $2000 by the end of the year and $3000 next year. Bullish
Recently added 500 shares of NEM to 8 other miners accumulated this year. All in all $275K worth.I am beginning to wonder if I should have listened to all the talking heads. This is turning out to be a lousy investment so far.
I normally reinvest money back into the stock market. For 2022 instead of using the money to buy stocks I am going to use all my extra fiat money to buy physical silver and gold. I believe it’s a good time to buy because gold and silver will still be held down by government and bank forces. If gold and silver were to spike dramatically the government will lose control of the currency. It’s going to happen!
"It's funny how ""operational challenges and accelerating costs"", which pretty much affects everyone, only causes miners to drop and not the stock market as a whole"
buy at 54 sell at 74
"if they dont buy back shares at yearly low prices, then management needs to get fired."
sold out. i shoulda listened to gut. they can't raise prices. prices get raised on them. only play is gold going up. and that's a big slow if.
