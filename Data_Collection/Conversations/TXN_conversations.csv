I just love how the news outlets spin stuff. In the Latest News section there is a Bloomberg article saying TXN met expectations and that indicates demand is slowing....while right after it is a Barron's article that says TXN experiencing such great demand that they are increasing capital spending to increase production.
$TXN also (along with $INTC) announced enormous capacity expansion plans for 2022. Good for WFE again.
drop is too strong - while there is some slow down currently mostly due to supply chain. But their capacity expansion plans are quite big. Meaning expecting further growth next year.

I am reading that TI is not providing Apple with chips. I can get an apple 13 5G phone pronto from Verizon. Stop the lies to bring down a good company.
Buying opportunity on this quality company.
Just looks like a good time for new investors to jump in at a slight discount from the last 6 months and a nice divy payment
This one always drops after ER
Back up the truck and load up..chip shortage is not forever and collect the dividend while we wait
They have rated the stock as 230$!!!Is it true?
buy the dip. TI always does this on ER
Will “The Lizard” bring down TI share price like he did last earnings call??Definitely a danger to TXN shareholders………..
"So, why the giant Drop￼￼ ?"
TI employees out of Indonesia lucked out.Covid-19 cases plummeted after government authorized Ivermectin for treatment after learning that big pharma vaccines made little difference.The Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency granted Emergency Use Authorizationf for Ivermectin as a therapeutic drug to cure Covid-19.
"Difficult to imagine what mental state a parent would have to be in to unnecessarily treat their healthy child with the ""vaccine"". Emergency use? Define the emergency for a healthy child. The morbidity rate is zero. The severe illness rate is near zero."

"What a JOKE! Even $TXN is getting PUMPED from 6% AH drop!The company stock is at all time high, while the expectations are at all time lows, yet the company MISSES all time low expectations and the stock price is not falling properly. In a rational market TXN must be down by 45-50%."
"Trying to understand this selloff but it's not registering with me. They delivered a beat on EPS, but revenue missed by less than 1% and was still up 22% yoy.... and that is justification for a 5% selloff? The short term mindset of traders crack me up. Still long. Still bearish. Any supply chain constraints are short term temporary issues and likely just translates into slightly less huge jump in growth."
