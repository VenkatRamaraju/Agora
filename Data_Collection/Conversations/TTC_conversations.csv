"Why it is going down, where will be the bottom line"
Toro is up 4.95% to 80.37
TTC is down 6.08% to 61.13
Buy at 200 DMA whatâ€™s to be unhappy about?
Ditch Witch is becoming a big drain. They paid too much for an out of date company.
Great numbers posted today. Was up over $3 earlier but has sold off. Guess it ran up too fast into earnings. I'm buying more.
TTC is down 6.93% to 64.75
TTC reached a 52 Week low at 55.87
I think TTC might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. if you guys have questions you should ask a.awesomestocks. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
My guess is that a large company like CAT is purposely driving it down but only reason would be to make an offer. If that happens stock should be 85$. So... no other reason I can think of. Regardless buy buy buy. Worth 75$ today. Numbers were awesome.
"$VEGN $VGANF - Plant & Co Brands $0.55 will be a top player for CAN & U.S as well, started from the bottom now working their way up with mergers and acquisitions to gain market share. Will trade with peers soon enough $VERY $BABY $TTC $BYND"

"I agree- steady EPS growth. But no revenue growth! Can you say ""squeezing blood from a turnip""? How are they accomplishing that? They have acquired companies but still no revenue growth. Nothing significant on the horizon to grow the revenue. Near or at record highs. P/E of 30! - double its historical P/E. Toro has been a solid stock but they are out over their skiis. Good company but be careful at these levels. One slip up and it could be easily cut in half."
"TTC reported Q1 this a.m. At a glance, it looks outstanding. Beat consensus estimates on both EPS and revenues. Strong cash flow with key accrual accounts (inventory, A/R) both down. Buybacks continue.Only weakness I noticed was residential lagging behind professional."
I added more shares today!
down again. Very frustrating. I added a few more shares today.
when are earnings??
Toro is up 7.06% to 115.86
Hoping it sells off even more so I can add a bit more shares. You rarely get a sell off in this stock.
Does this ever go up? lol

I went to 4 stores today and everyone was sold out of Toro Snowblowers. With a rough winter this might be boost to next quarter's profits

"In 1990 I worked for Toro and was awarded 5 shares of stock as a winner in a quality slogan contest. They have ballooned in value so much, now at age 80, I can buy a new car. Thank you Toro! I have never bought additional with my own $$$."
Looks like it bottomed here. We should get back to that $70 range over the next few months.

Looks to be a very good long term buy under $60. Anyone buying?
"Been thinking about TTC and pandemic, and it is reasonably well positioned. MA just became the last state to reopen golf courses, so that business should be ok. Lots of folks are nesting at home, so things like lawn mowers and edgers should do well. A bit concerned about the professional landscapers, but even that may not be too bad."
"OH YEAH, BEEN WAITIN ON THIS PRICE. ALL IN! FOR TMWR MORNIN GAP UP."
"Downside risk pretty much eliminated now I would guess, thoughts? Im not sure about you guys but awesom-eSTOCKS has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me."
"I've had TTC on my watch list for a while now and sub-$60 has always been my area of interest. Toro's profitability metrics are fantastic and competition is somewhat limited (not a sexy business). As a kicker, can easily be acquired by a larger player like SWK, not that I'm expecting that. Would appreciate thoughts from existing holders and others interested in TTC."
They have split at about $80-90 in the past. Does anyone know why they haven't split lately?
"Has to be a buy out folks. Great earnings report, beat just about everywhere AND forecast now higher. So.... only means someone trying to lower the price. Usually means an offer is pending. guessing someone like CAT. BUt, I would never sell this now. A buyout would prob be 85$ or 90$. So... don't stress. Guessing but ONLY logical excuse."

"Again...improved earnings with barely any revenue growth. And that is with a tax rate that dropped 7%. High P/E, minimal growth opportunity, insignificant dividend. This has been a good company as they improved their efficiencies. But they have acquired companies and the revenue number does not go up? In the past, this company's P/E topped out at 20. Now it is 27. This could quickly become a $45 or less. They need to borrow some money while it is still cheap and do something that will add 33% or more to the revenue number. Even at the expense of their high gross margin."

Please look at the financials. Its not much different than most of this qtrs earnings. On Rev's they did good or did they. It cost lots of money for them to make more money. The cost may/did not outweigh the end results. Very poor earnings in comparison.https://www.thetorocompany.com/news-releases/news-release-details/toro-company-reports-third-quarter-results
