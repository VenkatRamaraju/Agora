"Nice uptrend finally, plant based sector needs more attention. I like Plant & Co Brands establishing themselves in CAN + USA only $0.40 ! $VEGN $VGANF $TTC"
They have split at about $80-90 in the past. Does anyone know why they haven't split lately?
Up today on only189K shares compared to the average volume of 600K shares. Looks like buyqacks are the only thing holding this thing up. Almost a year from when this stock dropped about 13% in one day. Will that happen again near the end of August?
Looks to be a very good long term buy under $60. Anyone buying?
"In 1990 I worked for Toro and was awarded 5 shares of stock as a winner in a quality slogan contest. They have ballooned in value so much, now at age 80, I can buy a new car. Thank you Toro! I have never bought additional with my own $$$."
Please look at the financials. Its not much different than most of this qtrs earnings. On Rev's they did good or did they. It cost lots of money for them to make more money. The cost may/did not outweigh the end results. Very poor earnings in comparison.https://www.thetorocompany.com/news-releases/news-release-details/toro-company-reports-third-quarter-results
"Blowout quarter! Both earnings and revenues not only beat consensus, but exceeded the high end estimates."
This will open at 120 tomorrow
"I've had TTC on my watch list for a while now and sub-$60 has always been my area of interest. Toro's profitability metrics are fantastic and competition is somewhat limited (not a sexy business). As a kicker, can easily be acquired by a larger player like SWK, not that I'm expecting that. Would appreciate thoughts from existing holders and others interested in TTC."
Wall St is finally on to this one! Mentioned on CNBC. Look at the past few days on the daily chart. All institutional buying. This thinly traded stock started resulted in millions of shares purchased over a few days.

TTC is down 5.03% to 94.62
"What a solid company, killed it again in earnings. Four splits and then four doubles in SP since 2003. Tesla-like."
The Toro Company (TTC)Annual Report Available on 10-Khttps://sec.report/Document/0000737758-19-000028/
Toro reached an all time high at 91.09
Another company tanks after posting good earnings. Broken market!!
"Why it is going down, where will be the bottom line"
"Again...improved earnings with barely any revenue growth. And that is with a tax rate that dropped 7%. High P/E, minimal growth opportunity, insignificant dividend. This has been a good company as they improved their efficiencies. But they have acquired companies and the revenue number does not go up? In the past, this company's P/E topped out at 20. Now it is 27. This could quickly become a $45 or less. They need to borrow some money while it is still cheap and do something that will add 33% or more to the revenue number. Even at the expense of their high gross margin."
MF recommended buy today
Toro is up 4.95% to 80.37
