"Not sure what Spartan stock was at its best but Nash was over 45 dollars after to falling 3/share. So if Spartan was 30 a share and Nash was 40 plus a share they joined hands and made it down 8/share and back to 14/share?? At one point was a super company holding lead in the retail market, having great success in the wholesale and home run in military. The military was a separate segment and we let them do their own thing because they were experts at it. When Sptn took over they had a better way to do things - hmm how did that work out?? Still huge problems with the merger and just an overall mess flailing around trying to change things by buying companies to do things for them. Like the produce business. Also just opened a produce warehouse in Grand Forks. This idea was brought up back at a meeting 10 years ago and was thought to be a worthless endeavor. But, here they are trying to do it now? Good Luck to all. Of course, there are worse stocks."

"Arvind:I am now back into SPTN. I used to own years ago before they merged with Nash-Finch. I live in MI, and have shopped at their stores for a LONG time.Unless I am mistaken, I think today's drop in price was largely people/traders taking profits. SPTN has run up a TREMENDOUS amount in the last week or so. I think SPTN was mis-priced, that is why I bought back in...but to go up 6 points and 70% in a week is perhaps too much.I think this quarter, they will do well. I have not really noticed too much in terms of prices being raised. What i HAVE OBSERVED is that sales are less numerous and less generous than before. Every grocery stores is also selling out of almost anything they can get their hands on. SPTN also is somewhat blessed with their geography. A lot of their business is in the Midwest of the USA. This area has generally not been hit as hard as the coasts have.After this quarter, it is hard to see what will happen. Remember, SPTN has to fix some problems. Their acquisition of Fresh Kitchen is no good. I strongly suspect they will take a charge when they sell the shut down division. SPTN also needs to get a new permanent CEO. They also need to work on reducing debt and fixing up their capital structure.All of these problems can be addressed and fixed, but it will take hard work, time and a little luck.At $9/share, SPTN is too cheap. At $16/share, SPTN is too expensive (for now).Be patient, I think over time we will be rewarded."
21.67 today. Could rise further quickly if the 9.7% short interest waives the white flag. Shorts have been getting fusilladed. They may be getting gun shy.

"Call it Nash, not Spartan. Call it a Davidson, not a Harley."
Sptn and Svu are both up almost everyday and this makes me think a merger is being considered. Will hope both
"Although some of the good news is already baked in I expect this stock to be in the 21 - 23 range for earnings. Maybe they will even announce a new CEO also. After that and the COVID crisis lessens, it will probably give up some ground."

SPTN is 1 of the few UP today.
I am sure that the daily large volume that you see is everyone that works for the company. They are buying and selling stock in there 401k. They cant buy or sell except right after close. So this tells me if the workers there are buying such large volume and selling large volume they are a believer in the company that week. Remember they work for the company and know what is really going on. The bean counters can push beans all day long to make something look good or bad. All we see is the bean counters figures. So pay attention to the volume of sales at the end of the day to tell you if you should get in or out.

"Wow, this is some short squeeze!"
Groceries are the sweet spot during the Covid-19 public health crisis.
this should be going up not down!!
"In this market anybody in the grocery business will make money. As a rising tide lifts all ships (Warren Buffet). But, when the tide goes out ….. you get the picture. This little covid thing is benefiting SPTN and all others but they still have issues. Watch them down the road. There is some pain coming. Mainly, this management group is a little suspect with their decision making.. They lean toward using Spartan processes rather than Nash Finch when the Nash ones are better. The interim CEO is not the one to lead this company. So the CEO choice will be huge. I said why not go to Hyvee and see who they have that needs a big raise. ???"
Almost 4 million shares are now short SPTN (13% of the float). Should set up for a nice squeeze as only a couple hundred thousand shares trade each day.

Merger is not happening as some here speculated. Why? Director just sold 50k shares yesterday which was 20% of his holdings --- a MASSIVE sale and exit.Sell into strength. The SPTN rise post earnings has been irrational. I will be shorting tomorrow as the 2 different insider sales this week have just told me the stock is way over heated.

"SPTN: Will report earning tomorrow 6-2-2021. Expect to earn EPS estimate consensus$0.565. Most food stocks are GREEN today and SPTN did not participate in the rally. """"There was a great news released this morning as SpartanNash Names Douglas Hacker Chairman >SPTNDOW JONES & COMPANY, INC. 9:44 AM ET 6/1/2021 . """". I think SPTN will easily beat both EPS and REVENUE for its Q1-2021. I will take advantage of today's sell off and buy SPTN ahead of the EPS tomorrow The dividend of 3.85% or .20 cents quarterly is great as compared to .10% offer by bank out there.SPTN is a great value buy right now and I am a buyer of SPTN today."
About 2009 levels. This group frustrates. 29% higher odd...
Any bad news out today???
"Everyone is holding their breath waiting for the new CEO, It better be good. Also, the management is having problems with the merger. Still trying to get things right. Heard they were trying to go with SAP again. Have a failed already on a number of endeavors. SAP will be another. If a good CEO is named then it will POP.. Why don't they try someone from HYvee that knows how to run a grocery store."
going back down to 18?
Dropping 6% more today. People stop eating because the trade war?
Why is SPTN down 5% today? Any reason? Disapproval over the new CEO? SPTN seems very volatile. What is our long term outlook? I like safe boring dividend stocks.
Because the stock is extremely undervalued.....should be trading around $30 per share. This move today is nothing.
Thoughts on this stock long term? It appears they’re headed in the right direction
Please shake the weak sisters from the tree so we can get this thing back to 25 a share where it belongs.. Ridiculous for this to sit at this price.
Wow we’re up a bit. Will take it 
"I follow SPTN ,but I own a ton of UNFI. Very similar companies. Look what it do today when they made a pre-announcement of earnings."
"I am curious how the few people on this message board see this company? I have owned it twice now and have never lost money and I hope to make money again. It is nevertheless, rather boring. To be clear, boring can be really good when compared to disaster, so I am not saying I want volatility. I look at this like a smaller version of UNFI, but this company actually has a lot of retail grocery stores that UNFI does not have. I also see their Top Care generic name, low price products everywhere that I shop in Tennessee. Is this a company that can every take off, or is this just a boring safe investment? Your thoughts are important. Could they be bought out by someone? What about those warrants that AMZN holds? Good, bad, or ugly?"

"For those having anxiety due to dropping stock value, it would be a great time to dollar cost value by investing in more shares while the price is this low. I did this today."
Why would anyone sell SPTN in the $16's? I think it's a great buy down here. Stock was over $20 recently. SPTN has plenty of defensive appeal with a 4.6% dividend yield. They posted an excellent Q2 last month. Should have another strong Q3 earnings comp coming up...probably earnings of .60+/share vs. .30/share last year. Numbers down next year after the sharp increase this year. But SPTN still supposed to earn $2+/share in 2021. I think this one gets another pop up near $20 into the Q3 report.

"@Michael - What I wrote on this chat six months ago has come to fruition. You are an investor, not a trader -- reinvest the dividends on the Micro-Cap stock and enjoy the ride.

It is a good stock investment only don't overdue it with a Micro-Cap company--diversify."

"Hi All. Anybody has any ideas/ guesses about why this stock crashed 24% today? Overall market was up 8%. The lockdown around the world will create supply bottleneck for grocery products. On demand side, it would bring forward the demand because people are stocking more groceries then usual. That demand-supply mismatch should give pricing power to Spartannash. The company should be able to increase prices hence get higher profits than usual. That should have given a boost to this stock. On the contrart it has tanked 24% today. Will appreciate your views.

Way too cheap on every valuation metric. The 4% dividend is only 20% of Free Cash Flow and leverage is 2X EBITDA and trades just less than book value. Plus over 10% of the trading volume this past month has been an increase in short positions (up 600k shares to 4 million). With only 182k shares of trading volume per day that would take over 20 days to cover this high short position. This will be a classic short squeeze candidate in reddit and wall street bets. They will reverse the manipulation of whoever is shorting this company which doesn't warrant any shorting at all. I'm looking for $35 soon (PE = 14). Maybe higher if the short squeeze happens after earnings or sooner. Another positive is inflation (which is a huge benefit for wholesalers) this company.The company is a buyout target as well. This company has plenty of assets on the Balance Sheet that are increasing in value every day....

Made it to 22.80 and then of course the earnings call where they said they couldn't promise this kind of results every quarter or something like this. Maybe it was the CEOs phantom shares that threw people off. SPTN is not a darling of the stock market so it doesn't surprise me is back down again. Probably drop some more before it settles down.

"This is very confusing. TRhe company lowered its estimates for the 3/19 quarter to $.23-.24 from $.33-37 on 5/10. Yet, IBES never lowered the estimates. So, now, the company reports what it promised and the headline say it missed! Is the steep drop a reaction the ""miss"" headline? When is a miss not a miss? The company is also keeping '19 estimates at the $1.20-1.50 level (also downgraded this on 5/10). Again IBES has never lowered its estimates from the number before the company cut it. Huh?"
$SPTN announces this Wed. Looking for fill rates mainly as I suspect those are similar regardless of market sector served by the grocery supplies. On the demand side not sure govt. is correlated as much to the commercial market UNFI serves but maybe I am wrong? Either way SPTN earnings could act as a squeeze catalyst here.

My concern would dollar general being one of our top customers and the cost of distribution. this must be a ton of hand unloads which are typically the things that cut down profit margins at the big warehouses. Along with the loss of some of the bigger long standing customers..
Spartan has been surging. Great value stock paying a nice dividend.
Shouldn't sptn be booming now?
"If you want a boring stock with great financials and a great dividend, SPTN is the place for you. I've had it long-term (that's 8-10 years for you Millennials) have dividends reinvested and I've accumulated enough shares to provide me income when I retire, along with other dividend paying stocks. It's predictable and I am hopeful the company will retrieve the military commissary sector of their business out of the mud or sell it within the year of 2021. The new CEO prioritize this division."

Yikes!! Earnings report didn't look good at all.
anyone on the conference call?
Earning Release May 27
"Conference call: Very interesting. One observation I came away with is that their estimates for this year appear to be very conservative. They have built in food deflation which runs counter to the reopening-inflationary scenario expounded across the board. They base this on current trends that they see. I can understand it in the category of meat. One year ago meat processing plants were closed. This pushed up meat prices. These are now coming down with reopenings. They are also talking about labor costs with a nod to the $15 hour minimum goal of Biden. However, their labor costs are already $12-16 hourly. In any event the mandatory $15 is not written in stone. Analysts will probably lower their price targets based on the company's new '21 estimates of $1.68 - $1.80 versus IBES $2.08. On paper this is a big disappointment. However, as there so many unknowns about the timing and extent of post-Covid reopening, the company may just be following the tried-and-true pattern of under promise and over deliver. With so many unknowns to target a specific estimate is no better than a guess."

"@BillyBaroo I hope you are right. I doubled my position when it went from 20 down to 19. Bad move for sure. My frustration with this stock is that it does not act a safe haven at all. Most food producers and distributors are a haven in a market downturn. That is why we give up the potential of a double on the upside. But when the downside has no stop, you might as well be in energy or a commodity company. I continue to wonder if this company has an issue that someone knows and we don't? It trades like there is some underlying negative."

Instead it goes UP to as high as $23 on 4x volume. The next day comes a 24% plunge on two downgrades. BMO has a $23 target. Pivotal says SELL with a $14 target. Is Pivotal that influential? TipRanks does have the analyst,Ajay Jain, as 4 star but, c'mon........ On Thursday I eliminated SPTN from my watch list as I thought the move up was way overdone. Today, its back on the list! We'll see."
"I don't get it. They reaffirmed the dividend, which at $16 is nearly 4.5%, and brought down the guidance by 5% on account of Caito. None of this should have resulted in such a drop. And way too much volume to be an inside trade."

I doubled my position in SPTN the past 2 days. Current price yields a safe 4.35% dividend (only around 20% of free cash flow). This leaves plenty of room for dividend increases in the years to come. This stock will protect you from inflation and any covid variant resurgence. PE is too low.....$30 will be here before you know it.
Is there a new target price?
Shorts are going to have a hard time getting out of SPTN. AMC effect hitting multiple stocks today. $30 soon.
Nice job!

It's time to cut the fat cats at the top. Or just the short guy. Enough of cutting the workers actually doing the work and cut upper and middle management. That's where results are lacking. $4 here we come with inadequate leadership.
What a beautiful stock
