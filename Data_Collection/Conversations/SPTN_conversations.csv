"This is very confusing. TRhe company lowered its estimates for the 3/19 quarter to $.23-.24 from $.33-37 on 5/10. Yet, IBES never lowered the estimates. So, now, the company reports what it promised and the headline say it missed! Is the steep drop a reaction the ""miss"" headline? When is a miss not a miss? The company is also keeping '19 estimates at the $1.20-1.50 level (also downgraded this on 5/10). Again IBES has never lowered its estimates from the number before the company cut it. Huh?"
"SpartonNash (SPTN) is UNFI's only publicly traded competitor just released earnings/forecast: ""expects fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA to range from $237.0 million to $242.0 million""= ABOUT 1/3 of UNFI's forecasted EBITDA= IF you multiply SPTN EV by 3 = about $4.5 Billion.... then subtract out UNFI debt = about $2 BillionDIVIDED by shares outstanding = OVER $30/share= UNFI is EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED compared SPTN, its only publicly traded competitor, which itself is UNDERVALUED"
"I'm in, Boys. Seems like a mellow safe stock. Groceries. Dollar General. The Military. Good financials. I am a mellow retiree living off the dividend income."
Whole foods/Amazon could take over both SPTN and UNFI combined to satisfy Jeff Bezos's ambition without denting its pocket book.
"Arvind:I am now back into SPTN. I used to own years ago before they merged with Nash-Finch. I live in MI, and have shopped at their stores for a LONG time.Unless I am mistaken, I think today's drop in price was largely people/traders taking profits. SPTN has run up a TREMENDOUS amount in the last week or so. I think SPTN was mis-priced, that is why I bought back in...but to go up 6 points and 70% in a week is perhaps too much.I think this quarter, they will do well. I have not really noticed too much in terms of prices being raised. What i HAVE OBSERVED is that sales are less numerous and less generous than before. Every grocery stores is also selling out of almost anything they can get their hands on. SPTN also is somewhat blessed with their geography. A lot of their business is in the Midwest of the USA. This area has generally not been hit as hard as the coasts have.After this quarter, it is hard to see what will happen. Remember, SPTN has to fix some problems. Their acquisition of Fresh Kitchen is no good. I strongly suspect they will take a charge when they sell the shut down division. SPTN also needs to get a new permanent CEO. They also need to work on reducing debt and fixing up their capital structure.All of these problems can be addressed and fixed, but it will take hard work, time and a little luck.At $9/share, SPTN is too cheap. At $16/share, SPTN is too expensive (for now).Be patient, I think over time we will be rewarded."
My concern would dollar general being one of our top customers and the cost of distribution. this must be a ton of hand unloads which are typically the things that cut down profit margins at the big warehouses. Along with the loss of some of the bigger long standing customers..
Volume is low....so not much short covering yet. Big move is yet to come!!!!
Amazon has warrants to purchase Sptn shares at 17.72 a share. I think that at that price we may have a bottom at this price.
"There are rotation from Technology/Information sectors (large cap) into consumer staples sector which includes food stocks today.... and I am a buyer of SPTN as it is selling off today, while collecting 3.85% dividend.SPTN should bounce back to $21.50 near term."
"UNFI shareholder here. Can't believe both this and UNFI down here again. The restaurant wholesalers been stronger a good while now. I get the reopen trade, vaccine etc. but many other stay-home stocks been coming back up again----just not us. UNFI has our own issues specific to us---5X higher short interest than this due to higher debt, pending AMZN renewal, CEO replacement pending and other issues. Ya think we are each down on our own specific issues or its just seen as we hit the peak and nothing better after next few qtrs? or something else? GL"
Any thoughts on this continued weakness? The story about the Amazon warrants is a known issue. That is not new information. I find this trading of concern although the company seems to be doing good. Its not like there is some underlying skeleton in the closet. PE ratio and dividend should put this company at least 25.
Why would anyone sell SPTN in the $16's? I think it's a great buy down here. Stock was over $20 recently. SPTN has plenty of defensive appeal with a 4.6% dividend yield. They posted an excellent Q2 last month. Should have another strong Q3 earnings comp coming up...probably earnings of .60+/share vs. .30/share last year. Numbers down next year after the sharp increase this year. But SPTN still supposed to earn $2+/share in 2021. I think this one gets another pop up near $20 into the Q3 report.
"In this market anybody in the grocery business will make money. As a rising tide lifts all ships (Warren Buffet). But, when the tide goes out ….. you get the picture. This little covid thing is benefiting SPTN and all others but they still have issues. Watch them down the road. There is some pain coming. Mainly, this management group is a little suspect with their decision making.. They lean toward using Spartan processes rather than Nash Finch when the Nash ones are better. The interim CEO is not the one to lead this company. So the CEO choice will be huge. I said why not go to Hyvee and see who they have that needs a big raise. ???"
Heading towards an even bigger breakout this afternoon if we can get some volume. Shorts will be forced to cover driving the stock to $30+....
"Very nice dividend increase. We will always have corrections in the market and black swan events like we are experiencing at present, but this stock is a keeper for the long term"
"I follow SPTN ,but I own a ton of UNFI. Very similar companies. Look what it do today when they made a pre-announcement of earnings."
"SPTN: Will report earning tomorrow 6-2-2021. Expect to earn EPS estimate consensus$0.565. Most food stocks are GREEN today and SPTN did not participate in the rally. """"There was a great news released this morning as SpartanNash Names Douglas Hacker Chairman >SPTNDOW JONES & COMPANY, INC. 9:44 AM ET 6/1/2021 . """". I think SPTN will easily beat both EPS and REVENUE for its Q1-2021. I will take advantage of today's sell off and buy SPTN ahead of the EPS tomorrow The dividend of 3.85% or .20 cents quarterly is great as compared to .10% offer by bank out there.SPTN is a great value buy right now and I am a buyer of SPTN today."
"SPTN and UNFI are the only stocks that did not respond to the whole markets rally today.Their competitor PFGC, SYY, USFD etc....are all UP big today. Since the COVID 19 infections are skyrocketingright now toward the long winter ahead, everyone is loading up nature healthy foods supply for their families.In addition, the BIDEN 's COVID 19 group has just announced that in order to conquer the COVID 19 from spreading, they want to shut down the whole country for 6 weeks. This is the sad news but it is good newsfor the food distribution sector such as UNFI, SPTN, PFGC, SYY ......I will take this great opportunity to accumulate more UNFI and SPTN shares due to today's price drop...."
On our way to $30.....
What is the problem with SPTN? I can't find anything that accounts for the weakness in the stock given the overall market strength and this company doing very well in the eat at home era. Does anyone have thoughts on this? It is trading like there is a serious underlying skeleton in this closet. This company has virtually no debt.
"If you want a boring stock with great financials and a great dividend, SPTN is the place for you. I've had it long-term (that's 8-10 years for you Millennials) have dividends reinvested and I've accumulated enough shares to provide me income when I retire, along with other dividend paying stocks. It's predictable and I am hopeful the company will retrieve the military commissary sector of their business out of the mud or sell it within the year of 2021. The new CEO prioritize this division."
"This is a Micro-Cap stock. It will always be volatile.The financial's of the this company are strong--especially for a Micro-CAP stock. If you've invested money in SPTN you're either an investor or a trader. If you are an investor please sit back, enjoy the ride, and reinvest your dividends. If you are a trader, better be hawking this stock multiple times daily. I pity traders but I appreciate investors. If you've bought in to this company not knowing the nature of the company, please invest your time and money in another endeavor."
Almost 4 million shares are now short SPTN (13% of the float). Should set up for a nice squeeze as only a couple hundred thousand shares trade each day.
I know they have military contracts. Will the pullout of Afghanistan hurt them?
"2nd quarter ended 7/20/19. Schwab states: The anticipated report date for SPTN is not available. Gains previous quarter were $0.21. Okay, why isn’t it available. What’s going on at the company?"
"Potential short squeeze, close to 4% dividend price earn less than 10COVID still contributing to their volume. What else do you need?"

Thoughts on this stock long term? It appears they’re headed in the right direction
Great day to buy this strong dividend payer!
Spartan has been surging. Great value stock paying a nice dividend.
Made it to 22.80 and then of course the earnings call where they said they couldn't promise this kind of results every quarter or something like this. Maybe it was the CEOs phantom shares that threw people off. SPTN is not a darling of the stock market so it doesn't surprise me is back down again. Probably drop some more before it settles down. Got a good dividend coming up so that helps. A really good CEO coming in would jump this stock.
On our way to $30+.....shorts will have a hard time covering.
Dropping 6% more today. People stop eating because the trade war?
"Conference call: Very interesting. One observation I came away with is that their estimates for this year appear to be very conservative. They have built in food deflation which runs counter to the reopening-inflationary scenario expounded across the board. They base this on current trends that they see. I can understand it in the category of meat. One year ago meat processing plants were closed. This pushed up meat prices. These are now coming down with reopenings. They are also talking about labor costs with a nod to the $15 hour minimum goal of Biden. However, their labor costs are already $12-16 hourly. In any event the mandatory $15 is not written in stone. Analysts will probably lower their price targets based on the company's new '21 estimates of $1.68 - $1.80 versus IBES $2.08. On paper this is a big disappointment. However, as there so many unknowns about the timing and extent of post-Covid reopening, the company may just be following the tried-and-true pattern of under promise and over deliver. With so many unknowns to target a specific estimate is no better than a guess."
What a beautiful stock
With distribution starting to be an issue. Is a take over on the horizon?
"UNFI: There are sectors rolation from Large Cap - Technologies sector, Health Care sector, onto Russell - Small cap sector; specially Consumer Staples (Foods, Staples Retailing) ie: SYY, USFD, PFGC...both UNFI and SPTN are oversold and have not been participated in the markets rallied last week and today.Prices are at deep discounts right now. It is perfect timing to accumulate UNFI and SPTN at this pricing level. Your ROI is HUGH by the end of November and YE2020."
Way too cheap on every valuation metric. The 4% dividend is only 20% of Free Cash Flow and leverage is 2X EBITDA and trades just less than book value. Plus over 10% of the trading volume this past month has been an increase in short positions (up 600k shares to 4 million). With only 182k shares of trading volume per day that would take over 20 days to cover this high short position. This will be a classic short squeeze candidate in reddit and wall street bets. They will reverse the manipulation of whoever is shorting this company which doesn't warrant any shorting at all. I'm looking for $35 soon (PE = 14). Maybe higher if the short squeeze happens after earnings or sooner. Another positive is inflation (which is a huge benefit for wholesalers) this company.The company is a buyout target as well. This company has plenty of assets on the Balance Sheet that are increasing in value every day....
"Although some of the good news is already baked in I expect this stock to be in the 21 - 23 range for earnings. Maybe they will even announce a new CEO also. After that and the COVID crisis lessens, it will probably give up some ground."
