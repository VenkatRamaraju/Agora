"It appears the committee was impressed, this could be the reason..""Results show that 65.4% of patients closed their wounds in a median of 34 days and three visits.""""This abstract won the third place award and has been selected for the podium presentation by the Abstract Selection Committee of the 31st Annual Symposium on Advanced Wound Care & Wound Healing Society Meeting. Results of this study will also be presented at the poster session on Friday, April 27 at 7:15 pm in Exhibit Hall C1 (SAWC Poster #CR-022)."" Should be a great conference for OSIR!"

"This stock is being subjected to spoofing in my opinion. I’ve followed and owned this stock for a very long time and I believe it’s trading patterns are all messed up. Someone made a boatload of money in puts last month and they are setting up to do it again in the coming months. Watch how the stock just fades, completely divorced from the market averages on any day."
No activity on this board. Did anyone else catch the breakout in CR today? Moving very nicely on a big increase in average daily volume.
CR is a quiet play on infrastructure and hardware as the news administration enters office. Nice move today.
What more do you need to see? Earnings and revenue easily beat estimates and guidance was raised. The stock jumps 5% at the open as it should have but then it faded in a blink of an eye (in about half an hour actually). At the start of the conference call at 10 AM the stock was down on volume of close to 80k shares. Spoofing and collusion. Someone owns a lot of $50 put options and they will make money on them. I’m disgusted completely.

"I'm a long-term CR holder but have doubts about this acquisition. Okay. The Crane & Company product line will produce some revenue, but how does stationary and currency paper fit with the future of money in our society? What about Bitcoin? Paperless transactions?"
"Years ago a day like today would be very worrisome but that was years ago and not today. I bought another 20,000 shares today and absolutely feel 100% sure of what I am doing. The first week of November is going to go down as EPIC. #BTE, #TVE, #CR are all about to have incredible runs for the foreseeable future, and I will not be a watcher. In a years time these three stocks will be at the very least double from their share price today. When oil is sitting at $120 a barrel I expect all three will be triple their value! (IMHO)"
Huge order of 300k+ shares traded at 1:05 pm EST today.

"BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!! Max Mitchell and upper management still BEAT the street with following knowns:1. A major customer problem within the payment and merchandising division. 2. Paying $160 million for Cummins Allison business3. Paying $172 million for CIRCOR's Instrumentation & Sampling business 4. Completed $80 million of share repurchasesIn my opinion, CR is selling for 20% below fair value here. CR is worth $6+ billion."
Time for another post on the Crane board to offset the automated Yahoo msgs. Great ER and estimate beat. They're in the right industrial segments to profit from.
CR going strong last 2 trading days. Any good news or rumors?
