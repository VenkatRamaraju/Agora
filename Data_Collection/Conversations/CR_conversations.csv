"I'm a long-term CR holder but have doubts about this acquisition. Okay. The Crane & Company product line will produce some revenue, but how does stationary and currency paper fit with the future of money in our society? What about Bitcoin? Paperless transactions?"
That's exactly what I did. I am trading with an expert named Fedor vsevolod and with his experience and skills I can get maximum profits from my trading after 17 days of intense trading. Contact Mr Fedor vsevolod’s signals via Telegrm@…..Fedorvsevolod

This stock cannot get a break. Issued a QR that other companies would die for and the stock still drops. Certainly no mania here.

"This money manager is POUNDING the table for $CR:https://www.twst.com/interview/eyeing-value-oriented-diversified-industrials-heading-into-2018Crane (NYSE:CR) is another “industrial growth horse” company, a classification we provide for our very best-managed industrials we follow here at William Blair. These companies not only have above-average organic sales growth, profitability, ROIC and free cash generation, but also are all consistently exceptional at accretively redeploying the cash they generate. Crane is a company that has a good secular growth payments and merchandising technologies business that automates electronic and currency transactions around the world as well as produces high-speed currency validation, counting and exchange equipment. Crane is finally beginning to experience its first sequential order and sales growth reacceleration for its fluid-handling business, which generates about two-fifths of the company’s sales, after an extended period of decline beginning in 2012 or 2013. After several years of extensive operational restructuring, fluid handling is now generating very high incremental margins."

What more do you need to see? Earnings and revenue easily beat estimates and guidance was raised. The stock jumps 5% at the open as it should have but then it faded in a blink of an eye (in about half an hour actually). At the start of the conference call at 10 AM the stock was down on volume of close to 80k shares. Spoofing and collusion. Someone owns a lot of $50 put options and they will make money on them. I’m disgusted completely.
CR is a quiet play on infrastructure and hardware as the news administration enters office. Nice move today.
"Been watching closely since pandemic. Way oversold recently, time to create position?"
Raised guidance... imo CR is going par!

"rumor that Crane lined pipe division Resistoflex can't ship anything for some reason, Anyone heard of issue?"
"This stock is being subjected to spoofing in my opinion. I’ve followed and owned this stock for a very long time and I believe it’s trading patterns are all messed up. Someone made a boatload of money in puts last month and they are setting up to do it again in the coming months. Watch how the stock just fades, completely divorced from the market averages on any day."
I suspect a 10-12% dividend increase coming. ~ .03 or .04 increase coming.

Paying $160 million for Cummins Allison business3. Paying $172 million for CIRCOR's Instrumentation & Sampling business 4.

No activity on this board. Did anyone else catch the breakout in CR today? Moving very nicely on a big increase in average daily volume.
