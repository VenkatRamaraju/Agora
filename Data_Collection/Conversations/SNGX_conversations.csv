"SNGX Sept. 9, 2021 ""Soligenix, Inc., a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that the Office of Orphan Products Development of the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to the active ingredient hypericin for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, extending the target population beyond cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) as previously granted.The U.S. Orphan Drug Act is intended to assist and encourage companies to develop safe and effective therapies for the treatment of rare diseases and disorders. In addition to providing a seven year term of market exclusivity upon final FDA approval, orphan drug designation also positions Soligenix to be able to leverage a wide range of financial and regulatory benefits, including government grants for conducting clinical trials, waiver of expensive FDA user fees for the potential submission of a New Drug Application (NDA), and certain tax credits.""The FDA's decision to grant and expand our hypericin orphan drug designation beyond CTCL signifies an important step for Soligenix as we continue to advance the program toward NDA filing in the first half of 2022,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President & Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""HyBryte's biologic activity was clearly demonstrated in the positive Phase 3, pivotal FLASH (Fluorescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) study in patients suffering with early stage CTCL. The marketing exclusivity that this broadened orphan drug designation imparts adds significantly to the existing patent estate surrounding hypericin.""The Phase 3 CTCL clinical study was partially funded by the National Cancer Institute via a Phase II SBIR grant (#1R44CA210848-01A1) awarded to Soligenix."""
"SNGX 9/28: Soligenix Announces Accelerated Publication Demonstrating Efficacy and Broad Neutralizing Activity of its COVID-19 Vaccine in Non-Human Primates.""September 28 2021 - 07:30AM. ""PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 28, 2021 - Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today publication of pre-clinical immunogenicity studies for CiVax (heat stable COVID-19 vaccine program) demonstrating durable broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody responses, including against the Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concern. The article, titled ""Protein Vaccine Induces a Durable, More Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Response in Macaques than Natural Infection with SARS-CoV-2 P.1,"" has been posted as an accelerated preprint on bioRxiv (available here). The manuscript is part of the ongoing collaboration with Axel Lehrer, PhD, Associate Professor at the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), University of Hawai?i at Manoa (UHM). Development continues under a non-dilutive $1.5M Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) awarded to Soligenix in December 2020.""This technology platform has previously demonstrated an encouraging ability to generate vaccines that are stable at ambient temperature, potentially avoiding the need for refrigerated or frozen storage and distribution,"" said Jerome Kim, MD, Director General of the International Vaccine Institute. ""The encouraging development of a broadly neutralizing and efficacious subunit vaccine specifically for SARS-CoV-2, including the variants of concern, using the same heat stable technology platform offers greater promise for achieving worldwide vaccination in the current pandemic.""""We continue to advance our work using our vaccine platform, consisting of a robust protein manufacturing process and a thermostabilizing formulation, using the Soligenix ThermoVax process and the CoVaccine HT adjuvant. The CiVax vaccine has demonstrated broad and robust immune responses in mice, which is recapitulated here in NHPs and further shown to yield protection against infection with COVID-19 variants of concern. Our work with CiVax emerged from our ongoing efforts to develop heat-stable, single-vial format vaccines for filoviruses. The ability to rapidly pivot from filovirus to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the broad applicability of this platform and our productive collaboration with Soligenix,"" stated Dr. Lehrer. ""A single-vial subunit vaccine that can be shipped at ambient temperatures and that need only be reconstituted with sterile water immediately prior to use has the potential to bolster the global vaccination efforts by simplifying storage and distribution logistics.""""We believe that creating a COVID-19 vaccine, like CiVax, with enhanced stability at elevated temperatures has the potential to lead to a faster resolution of this global pandemic, curtailing the further evolution of the virus,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""Moreover, the introduction of a subunit vaccine that has been built on years of proven vaccine technology may also encourage the vaccine-hesitant. This platform not only has the potential to aid in the current worldwide pandemic; but the technology platform, with its broad applicability, may also aid in the preparation for future pandemics. With these latest results, we will be expanding discussions with various funding agencies in the coming weeks.""CiVax is the Company's heat stable subunit vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing collaborations with Dr. Lehrer have confirmed the feasibility of developing a broadly immunogenic vaccine for COVID-19. A full-length Spike protein antigen coupled with liquid or lyophilized (thermostabilized) CoVaccine HT adjuvant has been tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of Gamma variant challenge in non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs were vaccinated twice, three weeks apart, and were subsequently challenged with Gamma variant both intranasally and intratracheally 12 weeks later. While most vaccines tested in NHPs use a challenge date only four weeks post-vaccination when antibody levels are peaking, the use of a later challenge time in this study demonstrates the durable response elicited by this vaccine candidate. While the vaccine antigen is developed based on the Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, it elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concerns. After challenge, vaccinated animals had a lower peak viral load and more rapid resolution of infectious virus, coupled with reduced lung damage. ."
I see 3 dollars
fda approval moved to possible 2nd half of 2023
SNGX again UP big pre-market.Someone knows big news coming…GLTA
Wanna hear something funny? Trust me u do I’m always right. So nearly every program this company claims to be operating has fast track designation.  I know that hilarious isn’t it. Wanna hear something even funnier? I mean like lmao funny. Again trust me u do remember I’m always right. So here it is. The programs that have fast track designation they don’t intend to ever use it.   . See I’ll bet u fell out of your seat laughing. And guess what none of it is made up it’s all 100% true. Unreal huh? I know. It’s so crazy it’sFunny. 
"that's how I fill about sngx Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each. The villagers seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest, and started catching them. The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started Catching monkeys again.Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers. ""Look at allthese monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.Then they never saw the man nor his assistant, only monkeys everywhere!Now you have a better understanding of how the stock market"
Watch for results of SNGX speaking at Cantor Fitzgerald Global Healthcare Conference today 9/29.Imagine the Big-Pharma eyes & interest for SNGX's Temp controlled vaccines (including COVID) at this conference. Big Pharma interest for sure...
I don’t get the bashing on here. This is a 40mil market cap everyone that is willing to invest here already knows it’s risk. if you’re in the red and feel that management screwed you over then pull out. I would like to hear from those that are invested and why you think there is either short term or long term potential here. I would like to hear from long term investors since I am fairly new to this and still doing my research. Thank you
SNGX obvious manipulation with +10-15% every pre-market & after-hours for the past 2 weeks. SNGX's crazy low share structure 40m says no more SELLers so low volume mainpulation looking to shake out some shares before the inevitable news near-term getting SNGX back over $2.50...IMO?
Well at least Josh was smart and lucky enough to get out whole @$1.10. Good thing he was able to get all his money back. Others have not been so lucky. Just wait until tax loss selling time comes around. New 52 week lows will be coming this year.
Is this company making the Rivax jab?
"The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan drug designation to novel drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. The designation allows manufacturers to qualify for various incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical trials and — upon regulatory approval — 7 years of market exclusivity."
"Very logical to understand the importance of this advancement and approval by the FDA and totally understandable that everyone would want to get in on this at an early stage and hold for major gains. I bought 5,000 shares this morning when I saw the news and lookedin to how few shares are outstanding. There are currently only 40.1 million shares to be purchasedtoday and have a look at how many have already sold. That's right 39,900,000 as I type. Think about that... GO LONGS..!"
There was a pr of the delay on May 10th. Old news
Posted article related to presentation 18-19 conference.https://appliedradiationoncology.com/articles/photodynamic-therapy-shows-promise-in-treating-cutaneous-t-cell-lymphoma
the only reason this did not pop yesterday like i n d p did this morning is that it's below $5 and many mutual funds and institutions are not allowed to touch stocks below $5
There is a lot of talk of the next pandemic. I have reason to believe through some research that it may be the Marburg virus. Soligenix is the only company that I know of that is producing a vaccine for it. Ivesting in this is like buying Moderna stock before the the current pandemic. I bought last week and plan to add more shares in the near future. Do your own research and you may find yourself coming to the same conclusions. Best of luck.
"SNGX 9/16: Soligenix to Advance Synthetic Hypericin Development in Psoriasis.""8:23 am ET September 16, 2021: Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that following the validation of synthetic hypericin's biologic activity in the positive pivotal Phase 3 FLASH (Fluorescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) study in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), as well as positive proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrated in a small Phase 1/2 pilot study in mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients, the Company will be expanding this novel therapy under the research name SGX302 into psoriasis, a large and underserved market with a significant unmet medical need.Visible light-activated synthetic hypericin is a novel, first-in-class, photodynamic therapy (PDT) that is expected to avoid much of the long-term risks associated with other PDT treatments. Synthetic hypericin is a potent photosensitizer that is topically applied to skin lesions and taken up by cutaneous T-cells. With subsequent activation by safe, visible light, T-cell apoptosis is induced, addressing the root cause of psoriasis lesions. Other PDTs have shown efficacy in psoriasis with a similar apoptotic mechanism, albeit using ultraviolet (UV) light associated with more severe potential long-term toxicities. The use of visible light in the red-yellow spectrum has the advantage of deeper penetration into the skin (much more than UV light) potentially treating deeper skin disease and thicker plaques and lesions, similar to what was observed in the positive Phase 3 FLASH study in CTCL. Synthetic hypericin or HyBryte(TM) (tradename used in CTCL) was demonstrated in this study to be equally effective in treating both plaque (42% treatment response rate after 12 weeks treatment, p<0.0001 relative to placebo treatment) and patch (37%, p=0.0009) lesions of this orphan disease caused by malignant T-cells. Further, this treatment approach avoids the risk of secondary malignancies (including melanoma) inherent with both the frequently used DNA-damaging drugs and other phototherapies that are dependent on UV A or B exposure. The use of synthetic hypericin coupled with safe, visible light also avoids the risk of serious infections and cancer associated with the systemic immunosuppressive treatments used in psoriasis.""Similar to CTCL, psoriasis is a chronic disease where the management of side effects and toxicities is as important as the management of the disease itself. Having treated both CTCL and psoriasis patients for over 20 years and having seen first-hand how they struggle to find good treatment options, access to an additional effective and safe therapy would add significantly to patient care and quality of life,"" stated Neal Bhatia, MD, Director of Clinical Dermatology at Therapeutics Clinical Research in San Diego and an investigator in the Phase 3 FLASH study. ""The success of synthetic hypericin in targeting malignant T-cells during CTCL clinical trials is a promising indicator of the ability of SGX302 to provide a much-needed approach for the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis, also caused by dysregulated T-cells. This success is further supported by both the previous synthetic hypericin PoC study in psoriasis and by the success, albeit confounded by potentially severe toxicity, of other photodynamic therapies in psoriasis.""""During the last year, we have made announcements of several important development milestones that we have achieved with HyBryte(TM) (synthetic hypericin) in the treatment of early stage CTCL. We have clearly validated synthetic hypericin's biologic activity with the Phase 3 FLASH study in this orphan disease, where we expect to file a New Drug Application (NDA) in the first half of next year. We believe it is now appropriate to expand synthetic hypericin's or SGX302's development into different cutaneous T-cell diseases such as psoriasis, as a component of our long-term strategy to enhance the value of this unique compound,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""Psoriasis is an ongoing unmet medical need, with as many as 7.5 million people in the U.S. and 60-125 million people worldwide affected by this incurable disease. Given our promising results with hypericin to date, including a small Phase 1/2 PoC clinical trial in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, we are hopeful synthetic hypericin will have a role to play in helping patients suffering from this difficult to treat and chronic disease.""Dr. Schaber continued, ""As we get closer to initiating a follow-on Phase 2a clinical trial in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, we will provide further details regarding trial design and timeline; however, our high level plan in the interim is to evaluate different topical formulations of synthetic hypericin to ensure optimal"
I have to laugh when there are posts on here trying to say that market down turns are not the reason that SNGX is down but there is something wrong with the stock.
"SNGX 9/3: Hypericin Designated ""orphan Drug"" for Treatment of T-cell lymphoma.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/detailedIndex.cfm?cfgridkey=835521Incentives of Orphan Drug Designation- 7-year marketing exclusivity to sponsors of approved orphan products.- 25% federal tax credit for expenses incurred in conducting clinical research within the United States. ...- Waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) fees for orphan drugs.SNGX volume afterhours 9/3 was +20% & 1,800,000 or 4x daily average volume.GLTA !!!….…."
Under $1 again. We all know what that means. Time to pump another PR about either heat stable vaccine technology or Hybryte. Hop to it Shabby!
WowSngx is green On a big red day for the market
At 20 a share big pharma gets the company for less than one billion
pre market +9%
Though it failed in phase 3 with a bang SGX942 is still being ‚advertised‘ at their homepage. You just have to listen Shabbys indifference in communicating the failed drug back then. He didnt care a #>$#. Conman with all of his heart
The vaccine study is in collaboration with the universities of Hawaii and Colorado.
We are now at a stage that I like the most. When the hype fades out and thereal value of the stock is shown by the new level of volume now 4 times the average.As you could see from the volume today people still want in on this stock but now there's a difference. I believe the vast majority of those at this stage who are holding now are dedicated long. I'll hold for at least 6 months and at that point make my move when the price is twice what it is now. Cheers to all longs and I'll let you know if a chart shows me something worth posting.
Zack's estimates for cash burn is $6.6M Q3 and $7.8M Q4. That means half their cash will be gone by EOY. With only about $15M of cash left by EOY how will Shabby keep afloat without more massive dilution? Zacks estimates $32M 2002 cash burn. That's an average of $8M per quarter. This means the cash runway currently is only 9 months long. Certainly can expect more ATM machine use in the coming months.
"If Marburg virus emerges as the next threat to the world this company will do very well, I think there would be a large influx of funds to accelerate the production of a vaccine that they are currently in the early stages. We may see the market cap reach at least 1-5 billion in a fairly short period of time, so for the high risk investors it may be time to make your positions now."
(ADTX) $1.64 --Covid Pill BIG PHASE 3 results NEXT week =1000%++opp
Oh I can’t wait to see the data that I have already seen 50 times that they refuse toSubmitTo the fda. It’s gonna be awesome this time.
SNGX volume so low - they manipulate all they want...Float so low at 40m - SNGX wll run hard with BUY pressure...(I got a email update this morning so news coming)
5-10k shares is my target to own. At $1 not much can go wrong
"I was an investor in NVAX and sold too soon. Holding onto SNGX, just maybe it is heading in the same direction."
"SNGX has something UP this am +15%, and heavy BID action pre-market…Been consistent positive updates every 2 weeks so about time… GLTA"
Anyone able to view the NORD presentation. I went to register they wanted too much information
Good one as believed. NHP study positive results
"this news could raise share price to $2.00.sorry, wrong board"
