"The trades pattern since March, the information of the buying as the stock joined the Russell Index, its update for the fourth quarter, the market itself, the recent financial report, and the upcoming stock holders meeting in September really is bringing the SNGX stock to a majority point of delivering in the 4th quarter what is possible that investors dream of. I believe $3 is likely sooner than later and Zacks projection of $12 is a good bet with positive results in the 4th."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to the active ingredient hypericin in HyBryte for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, extending the target population beyond cutaneous T-cell lymphoma as previously granted."
Hard to believe that this company doesn’t get gobbled up. $29 million in cash vs $38 million in current market cap.
"this news could raise share price to $2.00.sorry, wrong board"
"I am looking forward to end the year with three drugs from SNGX ready for the next step of applying for FDA approval. Just waiting for the Phase 3 results from SNGX 301 Oral mucositis. This one will really impact the quality of life for many folks. For us investors if SNGX 942 is successful, having a pipeline going into 2021 with approximately $950 MILLION of serious revenues already identified as 3 real drugs Therapies with Fast Track Designation and two with Orphan status I think is a great place to be for planning 2021."

"SNGX 9/16: Soligenix to Advance Synthetic Hypericin Development in Psoriasis.""8:23 am ET September 16, 2021: Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that following the validation of synthetic hypericin's biologic activity in the positive pivotal Phase 3 FLASH (Fluorescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) study in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), as well as positive proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrated in a small Phase 1/2 pilot study in mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients, the Company will be expanding this novel therapy under the research name SGX302 into psoriasis, a large and underserved market with a significant unmet medical need.Visible light-activated synthetic hypericin is a novel, first-in-class, photodynamic therapy (PDT) that is expected to avoid much of the long-term risks associated with other PDT treatments. Synthetic hypericin is a potent photosensitizer that is topically applied to skin lesions and taken up by cutaneous T-cells. With subsequent activation by safe, visible light, T-cell apoptosis is induced, addressing the root cause of psoriasis lesions. Other PDTs have shown efficacy in psoriasis with a similar apoptotic mechanism, albeit using ultraviolet (UV) light associated with more severe potential long-term toxicities. The use of visible light in the red-yellow spectrum has the advantage of deeper penetration into the skin (much more than UV light) potentially treating deeper skin disease and thicker plaques and lesions, similar to what was observed in the positive Phase 3 FLASH study in CTCL. Synthetic hypericin or HyBryte(TM) (tradename used in CTCL) was demonstrated in this study to be equally effective in treating both plaque (42% treatment response rate after 12 weeks treatment, p<0.0001 relative to placebo treatment) and patch (37%, p=0.0009) lesions of this orphan disease caused by malignant T-cells. Further, this treatment approach avoids the risk of secondary malignancies (including melanoma) inherent with both the frequently used DNA-damaging drugs and other phototherapies that are dependent on UV A or B exposure. The use of synthetic hypericin coupled with safe, visible light also avoids the risk of serious infections and cancer associated with the systemic immunosuppressive treatments used in psoriasis.""Similar to CTCL, psoriasis is a chronic disease where the management of side effects and toxicities is as important as the management of the disease itself. Having treated both CTCL and psoriasis patients for over 20 years and having seen first-hand how they struggle to find good treatment options, access to an additional effective and safe therapy would add significantly to patient care and quality of life,"" stated Neal Bhatia, MD, Director of Clinical Dermatology at Therapeutics Clinical Research in San Diego and an investigator in the Phase 3 FLASH study. ""The success of synthetic hypericin in targeting malignant T-cells during CTCL clinical trials is a promising indicator of the ability of SGX302 to provide a much-needed approach for the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis, also caused by dysregulated T-cells. This success is further supported by both the previous synthetic hypericin PoC study in psoriasis and by the success, albeit confounded by potentially severe toxicity, of other photodynamic therapies in psoriasis.""""During the last year, we have made announcements of several important development milestones that we have achieved with HyBryte(TM) (synthetic hypericin) in the treatment of early stage CTCL. We have clearly validated synthetic hypericin's biologic activity with the Phase 3 FLASH study in this orphan disease, where we expect to file a New Drug Application (NDA) in the first half of next year. We believe it is now appropriate to expand synthetic hypericin's or SGX302's development into different cutaneous T-cell diseases such as psoriasis, as a component of our long-term strategy to enhance the value of this unique compound,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""Psoriasis is an ongoing unmet medical need, with as many as 7.5 million people in the U.S. and 60-125 million people worldwide affected by this incurable disease. Given our promising results with hypericin to date, including a small Phase 1/2 PoC clinical trial in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, we are hopeful synthetic hypericin will have a role to play in helping patients suffering from this difficult to treat and chronic disease.""Dr. Schaber continued, ""As we get closer to initiating a follow-on Phase 2a clinical trial in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, we will provide further details regarding trial design and timeline; however, our high level plan in the interim is to evaluate different topical formulations of synthetic hypericin to ensure optimal"

"SNGX within 2wks: UK & now Japan ! Unbelievable deal at this pps !!! ""Soligenix Receives Japanese Patent for Improved Production of Synthetic Hypericin Composition 7:30 am ET May 20, 2021 (PR Newswire) Print Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that the Japan Patent Office has allowed the patent application titled ""Systems and Methods for Producing Synthetic Hypericin"". The allowed claims are directed to unique, proprietary methods to produce a novel, highly purified form of synthetic hypericin, and are similar to those previously allowed in the United States (U.S.). Synthetic hypericin is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in HyBryte(TM) (SGX301), the Company's photodynamic therapy, for which positive primary endpoint results in a pivotal Phase 3 study for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) were recently announced. This new patent is the first allowed in Japan covering the proprietary methods developed by the Company and further expands the comprehensive HyBryte(TM) patent estate, which includes protection on the composition of the purified synthetic hypericin, methods of synthesis and therapeutic methods of use in both CTCL and psoriasis, and is being pursued worldwide. https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1514137/HyBryte_High_Resolution_Logo.jpg HyBryte(TM) (synthetic hypericin) is a novel first-in-class photodynamic therapy for first-line treatment of early stage CTCL. In the recently completed pivotal Phase 3 FLASH (Fluorescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) trial, HyBryte(TM) achieved a statistically significant treatment response rate (p=0.04) in the primary endpoint after just 6 weeks (Cycle 1) of therapy when compared to placebo. This positive treatment response continued to significantly improve with extended HyBryte(TM) treatment in the open-label treatment cycles after 12 weeks (Cycle 2) and 18 weeks (Cycle 3) total treatment, reinforcing the positive HyBryte(TM) primary endpoint treatment response demonstrated in Cycle 1. In addition, HyBryte(TM) has demonstrated a statistically significant response in both patch and plaque lesions through 12 weeks of treatment (Cycle 2), highlighting the unique benefit of using visible light with its deeper skin penetration. HyBryte(TM) was well tolerated throughout the study and no mutagenic risks have been identified, unlike other second-line or off-label treatments, including other phototherapies, which utilize ultraviolet light. The Company believes HyBryte(TM) has compelling competitive advantages over existing therapies for early stage CTCL and represents a significant commercial opportunity. ""This recently issued patent continues to expand, strengthen and protect our synthetic hypericin patent estate,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""With the support of key patient advocacy organizations, such as the Cutaneous Lymphoma Foundation, and key opinion leaders, we are moving towards marketing approval and commercialization of HyBryte(TM), with the initial focus on the U.S. market, with partnership opportunities being explored to leverage ex-U.S. markets."" About Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) CTCL is a class of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a type of cancer of the white blood cells that are an integral part of the immune system. Unlike most NHLs which generally involve B-cell lymphocytes (involved in producing antibodies), CTCL is caused by an expansion of malignant T-cell lymphocytes (involved in cell-mediated immunity) normally programmed to migrate to the skin. These malignant cells migrate to the skin where they form various lesions, typically beginning as patches and may progress to raised plaques and tumors. Mortality is related to the stage of CTCL, with median survival generally ranging from about 12 years in the early stages to only 2.5 years when the disease has advanced. There is currently no cure for CTCL. Typically, CTCL lesions are treated and regress but usually return either in the same part of the body or in new areas."""

Since the beginning of June, SNGX stock is higher by 52%, and the expectation from analysts at Zacks Small-Cap research expect the trend to continue. That expectation is supported by a research report published in July that highlighted the potential in the SNGX pipeline and providing an $8.00 price target in the next 12-months. Assuming their models are correct, a move to the $8.00 level will serve up a more than 580% increase from the stocks most recent price of $1.06 per share.The recent enthusiasm comes from the already known data from the SGX942 Phase II trial.

"Soligenix 8//23 Announces Publication Demonstrating Successful Formulation and Heat Stabilization of Filovirus Vaccine Platform for Ebola and Marburg Virus Diseases""Soligenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today a publication describing the formulation of single-vial platform presentations of monovalent (single antigen), bivalent (two antigens) and trivalent (three antigens) combinations of filovirus vaccine candidates. In collaboration with University of Hawai?i at Manoa (UHM) and University of Colorado (UC) co-authors, the manuscript entitled ""Single-Vial Filovirus Glycoprotein Vaccines: Biophysical Characteristics and Immunogenicity after Co-lyophilization with Adjuvant"", has been published in Vaccine.The antigens and adjuvants used in this study have been previously demonstrated to protect non-human primates (NHPs) from subsequent infection. Lyophilization of the antigens within monovalent vaccine formulations has also been demonstrated to thermostabilize the antigens at temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to 12 weeks, enabling storage at ambient temperature. No currently licensed lyophilized vaccine that contains adjuvant is presented in a single-vial format and there are few reports of successfully using nano-emulsions in these lyophilized formulations. The published paper describes the use of a single-vial platform to co-lyophilize antigen(s) and a nano-emulsion adjuvant, CoVaccine HT, maintaining key adjuvant stability characteristics including particle size and colloidal stability. Further, antibody responses previously shown for monovalent vaccines were maintained in both mice and NHPs for the trivalent single-vial co-lyophilized vaccine candidates. Most recently, one of these trivalent formulations has also been shown to protect 75% of vaccinated NHPs against subsequent Sudan ebolavirus challenge, with further development to test efficacy against other filovirus infections ongoing.""Filoviruses such as Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg marburgvirus are some of the most lethal viruses known, and they are endemic in areas of the world where the power supply and distribution network can be uncertain. A thermostabilized vaccine in a single-vial format would significantly enhance any public health response to a new outbreak, at its source,"" stated Axel Lehrer, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), UHM. ""Our work to date has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid and efficient manufacturing, as well as the ability to thermostabilize multiple antigens that can then be stored at temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Having a vaccine platform available such as this has the potential to accelerate worldwide vaccination campaigns addressing future health emergencies, including another global pandemic like the one we are unfortunately experiencing with COVID-19.""""Our combined vaccine platform includes three major components: a robust protein manufacturing process that has been demonstrated on multiple protein antigens, a novel nano-emulsion adjuvant which induces broad immunity and a formulation procedure which enables thermostabilization of the combination of adjuvant and antigen in a single vial,"" stated Oreola Donini, PhD, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Soligenix. ""Elements of this vaccine platform have been utilized in our ricin toxin, filovirus and COVID-19 vaccine candidates, indicating its broad applicability. The ability to package the vaccine candidates in a single-vial platform further adds to their developability, whether as a multivalent or individual monovalent vaccine, particularly against Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus where there are currently no available vaccines."""
"If you really want to know where SNGX is heading in the following weeks and months have a look at the past few weeks and let history be your guide to the future.I'm not kidding you one bit folks, go have a look at the 6 month chart right now.You will have no worries... what-so-ever... :-)"

Unless these guys get a proven partnership with a big pharma we will never go beyond this penny land.Hope the BOD understand and get into a partnership so that some recognition will be there.Otherwise it is all smoke and mirrors.Gl!
"According to SNGX website the purpose of the Dom-innate study ""is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SNGX942 in reducing the duration of severe oral mucositis."" The topline results reported 12/23/20, said there was a 56% decrease in the median duration from 18 days to 8 days in the SNGX cohort. How is that a failure? What am I missing?"
"When you have multiple federal agencies providing funding to a company the concept of the drug is sound. To then further have these federal agencies fund phase 3 and give it Orphan status says it has great potential. Then you have the results to date for two of the drugs in final stages and this year being prepared for submission for final FDA approval and a third coming in the 4th quarter. After many years of following this stock, buying and selling it, I am holding because it is ripe to be a big winner. Read the material on their web site. The other two notes is that their cash burn is much lower than most companies due to the federal funding. I also like that New Jersey continues to give it the tax credits.. The federal funding and the tax credits helps us as share holders since SNGX does not have the pressure to sell more shares at this time due to their funding. Good Luck to everyone."
"Great news for the company. Schaber and his team joined a relatively rare club, that is, one that conducted a successful phase3 trial. It's the holy Grail of biotech. Also, efficacy was achieved at 6 weeks, unheard of in CTCL. At 12 weeks efficacy is climbing above 35%. My guess is above 70% at 16 weeks. Amazing. Based on safety and efficacy, should become standard of care"
"Is there going to be a rush to the exits? Heavy profit taking this morning, some lucky people are going to enjoy a wonderful weekend after the money they made and ""secured"" earlier today after an exciting week! Coming in at $2.08 on Tuesday and getting out at $3.23 today made many traders some very serious fast cash, well done!!"

(NASDAQ:SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today positive data demonstrating the efficacy of multiple filovirus vaccine candidates in NHPs, including thermostabilized multivalent vaccines in a single vial platform presentation. Collaborators at the at the University of HawaiÊ»i at MÄnoa (UHM) describe the potent efficacy of vaccine candidates protecting against three life-threatening filoviruses, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg Marburgvirus in an article titled ""Recombinant Protein Filovirus Vaccines Protect Cynomolgus Macaques from Ebola, Sudan, and Marburg Viruses"", published in Frontiers in Immunology. These vaccine candidates contain highly purified protein antigens combined with the novel CoVaccine HTâ?¢ adjuvant, in both monovalent (single antigen) and bivalent (two antigen) formulations. Most recently, efforts to formulate all three antigens and adjuvant into a thermostable single-vial vaccine platform has also been shown to protect 75% of vaccinated NHPs against subsequent Sudan ebolavirus challenge, with further development to test efficacy against other filovirus infections ongoing.

Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), UHM, ""Our work to date has demonstrated not only the feasibility of rapid and efficient manufacturing, but also the applicability of thermostabilization of multiple antigens with the potential for a broadly applicable and easily distributed vaccine. Once developed, such a vaccine may be able to address emerging outbreaks, such as the Marburg virus infection that appeared in Guinea recently. We feel that this technology may be an important contribution to Dr. Fauci's proposed idea to develop prototype vaccines against the top 20 viral families that may also cause pandemics. Having such a platform available would likely enable broader and faster worldwide vaccination campaigns addressing future health emergencies. In addition, the ability to combine antigens in the formulation also enables generation of potentially broader protective vaccines."" ""The continued advances in the filovirus program demonstrates the program's maturity and overall ability to successfully develop vaccines against these lethal viral threats,"" noted Oreola Donini, PhD, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Soligenix. ""The compatibility with thermostabilization, and the identification of key stability indicating assays, are both hallmarks of a potentially broadly applicable vaccine platform. This most recent demonstration of protective efficacy against subsequent challenge continues to advance the overall platform, as well as the Sudan ebolavirus program specifically. Using this platform, we also continue to accelerate our joint COVID-19 vaccine effort, called CiVaxâ?¢, with Dr. Lehrer and look forward to discussing further developments for both programs in the near future."""

To the moon get ready load before it’s late
On the SNGX web site there is a detail write up referencing the 12/22/20 Phase 3 results and many other components of the company pipeline for 2021. So I am sticking with SNGX.While the home run we hoped for did not happen with the Phase 3 results on SGX942 Oral Mucositis it still showed good results for the treatment. I look forward to seeing more results learned from the Phase 3 because it improved the quality of life of folks. It would be great to build off of that to find ways to continue that growth and impact. I would not be surprised if the FDA feels the same and works with SNGX to design or identify a focus use.
Zack's estimates for cash burn is $6.6M Q3 and $7.8M Q4. That means half their cash will be gone by EOY. With only about $15M of cash left by EOY how will Shabby keep afloat without more massive dilution? Zacks estimates $32M 2002 cash burn. That's an average of $8M per quarter. This means the cash runway currently is only 9 months long. Certainly can expect more ATM machine use in the coming months.
Some nice steps and ladder chart movement! I like what I am SEEiNG
nice market size !. I see an ez takeover target. DD.
60 mill already in Grant's and the gov has tens of billions more planned. SNGX has already.got the 60 mill. It is not as if they are an unknown to the gov.

While some on here pushing the word dilution I would suggest one look at their cash, external funding from the Feds and New Jersey tax credits for the reality of their ability to keep things moving in the right direction. The rest of 2020 for SNGX is set to bring results worthy of patience."
There is a lot of talk of the next pandemic. I have reason to believe through some research that it may be the Marburg virus. Soligenix is the only company that I know of that is producing a vaccine for it. Ivesting in this is like buying Moderna stock before the the current pandemic. I bought last week and plan to add more shares in the near future. Do your own research and you may find yourself coming to the same conclusions. Best of luck.
"FDA Grants Soligenix ""Fast Track"" Designation for RiVax in the Prevention of Ricin Poisoning PR NewswireFebruary 13, 2020PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that its RiVax (heat stable ricin toxin vaccine) development program for prevention of ricin intoxication has received ""Fast Track"" designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-grants-soligenix-fast-track-120000052.html"
"The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan drug designation to novel drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. The designation allows manufacturers to qualify for various incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical trials and — upon regulatory approval — 7 years of market exclusivity."
Heating 8% in premarket. 
"The news this morning might be a neutral event for the sp imo. $2.50 is a tell for future trend. Size at $3.50 indicates what we all know...other news events are on the short-term horizon. I assume that improved proof of concept for Rivax will lead to a renewed or new partnership and most importantly, FDA approval."

Hypericin got FDA approval?
I'm adding here
Under $1 again. We all know what that means. Time to pump another PR about either heat stable vaccine technology or Hybryte. Hop to it Shabby!
Anyone able to view the NORD presentation. I went to register they wanted too much information
Per Steve. It is a pleasure to read such common sense and intelligence. 2020 there were a lot of bio's that went from 1 or less to high double digits. Let's hope SNGX repeats the trend. ps. you are right about Todd or alias.
The sngx army is gaining ground. We will win this battle. 
"Todd. your medical background is relevant as your accusing the vaccine article of being fraudulent. Again, please state your qualifications."
Short run away
I see 3 dollars
"Soligenix may not be receiving the same press attention as Pfizer or Moderna, but its COVID vaccine candidate is equally-if-not-more impressive. CiVax's potential is unappreciated when considering the vaccine can be kept at room temperature, may only require one shot, and is based on a vaccine technology that has a history of tested safety and efficacy."
at least it's not red
"The new Power Point Presentation is impressive. IMHO, Soligenix is poised for an upside breakout, assuming they announce a comprehensive partnership for manufacturing, distribution and marketing. The science, the results, and the unmet medical needs are extraordinary potential drivers for monetization in the near future."
"Here is my view on SNGX. 1) The company has said we will see results in Q1. They did not say January or February - they said Q1 those earlier dates/expectations were set up in the heads of people that jumped in feet first and pushed to stock up to $3 or a little beyond.2) The company has a history of ""sob stories"" and failure. While I am optimistic that this time will be different, history is not on our side, with this company - so my view is hopeful, but reserved.3) I think the move from $3.50 back to $2.75 or so was because of the window for reporting closing and the questions marks around approval. This most recent additional drop - is clearly tied to the market (you would be hard pressed to find a stock that has not fallen substantially in the last 3-4 weeks).For me - I am in wait and see mode. I will be patient until Monday April 6th. I believe we will hear something before that date. If not, I am going to begin leaning toward bad news/failure - once again. Just as a FYI - I bought my shares late last year around .90 and sold half of my position at $3 - so I feel pretty good about where I am at. I am toying with the idea of buying back a few of those shares I sold at $3, but have not done so yet. I likely will just sell out and move away from this completely (or reduce my position one more time), if we fail to hear anything by April 6th, as noted above.Good luck to the longs on this..."
"If Marburg virus emerges as the next threat to the world this company will do very well, I think there would be a large influx of funds to accelerate the production of a vaccine that they are currently in the early stages. We may see the market cap reach at least 1-5 billion in a fairly short period of time, so for the high risk investors it may be time to make your positions now."
Well at least Josh was smart and lucky enough to get out whole @$1.10. Good thing he was able to get all his money back. Others have not been so lucky. Just wait until tax loss selling time comes around. New 52 week lows will be coming this year.
"that's how I fill about sngx Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each. The villagers seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest, and started catching them. The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started Catching monkeys again.Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers. ""Look at allthese monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.Then they never saw the man nor his assistant, only monkeys everywhere!Now you have a better understanding of how the stock market"
The support at 0.93 is wayy too strong for it to break anytime within the next month. Buying right now is great for the mid-term.

SGX942 will get approved eventually. Phase 3 failed on a technicality. Patients who consistently took the drug saw significant benefit.
Finally moving! Let's see if it reaches $1.50 today
I have to laugh when there are posts on here trying to say that market down turns are not the reason that SNGX is down but there is something wrong with the stock.
"I am under the impression that SNGX has applied for funds from government, most likely the Warp speed program or some similar funding source, but has yet to hear. I got that impression from the presentation this morning since the stance was an expectation of funding for the COVID 19 SNGX solution. While I invested in the Company for the other drug pathways, this would definitely be a game changer for the company since the implications is a vaccine for everyone or a means for other vaccines to be more deliverable. Very interesting data results forth coming soon and Soligenix is definitely a stock with potential for investors. Good Luck everyone."

"The reverse split that the company warned about in the 10K is not included in the proxy that was filed Friday, confirming that someone is very intentionally taking care of this delisting issue for the company. Notice that the cut off date for the proxy is July 15th, precisely 1 day before this current run to above $1 began in earnest with a 1.3M share day. What a mystery.

"SNGX news 12/28: $1.5m for Covid. PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has awarded Soligenix a Direct to Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant of approximately $1.5 million to support manufacture, formulation (including thermostabilization) and characterization of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) and EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) vaccine candidates in conjunction with the CoVaccine HT (CoVaccine) adjuvant. This award also will support immune characterization of this novel, emulsified adjuvant that has unique potency and compatibility with lyophilization strategies to enable thermostabilization of subunit vaccines. CiVax is the Company's heat stable subunit vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19, the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing collaborations with Axel Lehrer, PhD, Associate Professor (Vaccinology) in the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), University of Hawai?i at Manoa (UHM) have demonstrated the feasibility of developing a highly immunogenic vaccine for COVID-19. With significant research dedicated worldwide to the generation of COVID-19 vaccines, it is noteworthy that the essential attributes of a vaccine successful in controlling the ongoing pandemic are believed to include the ability to rapidly stimulate a Th1/Th2 balanced antibody response, raising significant virus neutralizing antibodies, as well as induce potent cell-mediated immunity. Previous work with the CoVaccine adjuvant, which Soligenix licensed from BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, a division of Boston Scientific Corporation, has indicated that CoVaccine has these critical characteristics. In addition, unlike other vaccine candidates that have logistical challenges due to cold chain requirements (in some cases requiring maintenance of temperatures less than -70 degrees Celsius), the underlying technology platform has demonstrated the ability to produce single vial vaccines which are stable up to temperatures at least as high as +40 degrees Celsius."

Good one as believed. NHP study positive results
"Going with the science to figure out when to expect 4th quarter results for the Oral Mucositis SGX942 results. Full enrollment of the the study was made on 6/24/20. The study tracks along with the person receiving their radiation treatment at every third week. Followed by SGX942 twice a week for two weeks. Since a person can realistically have six months of radiation, I project that most participants will be completed between November 18 and December 16th. So not hearing anything now should be expected on this study. The other interesting news is the realization and discussion now of the need for cold storage and how to deal with that problem for any vaccine no matter who produces it. SNGX may have that answer based on their completed research to date. While I wish science would hurry up so I have results. Science and patience are two things that are not what the market waits for.

""PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 28, 2021 - Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today publication of pre-clinical immunogenicity studies for CiVax (heat stable COVID-19 vaccine program) demonstrating durable broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody responses, including against the Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concern. The article, titled ""Protein Vaccine Induces a Durable, More Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Response in Macaques than Natural Infection with SARS-CoV-2 P.1,"" has been posted as an accelerated preprint on bioRxiv (available here). The manuscript is part of the ongoing collaboration with Axel Lehrer, PhD, Associate Professor at the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), University of Hawai?i at Manoa (UHM). Development continues under a non-dilutive $1.5M Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) awarded to Soligenix in December 2020.""This technology platform has previously demonstrated an encouraging ability to generate vaccines that are stable at ambient temperature, potentially avoiding the need for refrigerated or frozen storage and distribution,"" said Jerome Kim, MD, Director General of the International Vaccine Institute. ""The encouraging development of a broadly neutralizing and efficacious subunit vaccine specifically for SARS-CoV-2, including the variants of concern, using the same heat stable technology platform offers greater promise for achieving worldwide vaccination in the current pandemic.""""We continue to advance our work using our vaccine platform, consisting of a robust protein manufacturing process and a thermostabilizing formulation, using the Soligenix ThermoVax process and the CoVaccine HT adjuvant. The CiVax vaccine has demonstrated broad and robust immune responses in mice, which is recapitulated here in NHPs and further shown to yield protection against infection with COVID-19 variants of concern. Our work with CiVax emerged from our ongoing efforts to develop heat-stable, single-vial format vaccines for filoviruses. The ability to rapidly pivot from filovirus to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the broad applicability of this platform and our productive collaboration with Soligenix,"" stated Dr. Lehrer. ""A single-vial subunit vaccine that can be shipped at ambient temperatures and that need only be reconstituted with sterile water immediately prior to use has the potential to bolster the global vaccination efforts by simplifying storage and distribution logistics.""""We believe that creating a COVID-19 vaccine, like CiVax, with enhanced stability at elevated temperatures has the potential to lead to a faster resolution of this global pandemic, curtailing the further evolution of the virus,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""Moreover, the introduction of a subunit vaccine that has been built on years of proven vaccine technology may also encourage the vaccine-hesitant. This platform not only has the potential to aid in the current worldwide pandemic; but the technology platform, with its broad applicability, may also aid in the preparation for future pandemics. With these latest results, we will be expanding discussions with various funding agencies in the coming weeks.""CiVax is the Company's heat stable subunit vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing collaborations with Dr. Lehrer have confirmed the feasibility of developing a broadly immunogenic vaccine for COVID-19. A full-length Spike protein antigen coupled with liquid or lyophilized (thermostabilized) CoVaccine HT adjuvant has been tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of Gamma variant challenge in non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs were vaccinated twice, three weeks apart, and were subsequently challenged with Gamma variant both intranasally and intratracheally 12 weeks later. While most vaccines tested in NHPs use a challenge date only four weeks post-vaccination when antibody levels are peaking, the use of a later challenge time in this study demonstrates the durable response elicited by this vaccine candidate. While the vaccine antigen is developed based on the Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, it elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concerns. After challenge, vaccinated animals had a lower peak viral load and more rapid resolution of infectious virus, coupled with reduced lung damage. ."

(“EPDG”); and Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC (“EMOB” and together with EBS and EPDG, “Emergent”) with the American Arbitration Association in Mercer County, New Jersey in which the Company has alleged that (a) EPDG breached the EPDG Subcontract (defined in the following paragraph), the EPDG Quality Agreement (defined in the following paragraph), an express warranty, a warranty of merchantability, and a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, (b) EMOB breached the EMOB Quality Agreement (defined in the following paragraph); (c) EPDG was unjustly enriched; (d) EPDG and EMOB were negligent in the performance of their work; and (e) EBS fraudulently induced the Company into entering into the contracts with EPDG and EMOB. Emergent has answered that demand for arbitration denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. After several months of negotiations and based on representations Emergent made related to its capabilities in developing upstream and downstream processes for vaccines and its designation as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, in May 2015, the Company entered into a subcontract (the “EPDG Subcontract”) with EPDG, pursuant to which EPDG agreed to manufacture, and provide to the Company, RiVax bulk drug substance (“BDS”). In March 2017, the Company entered into a quality agreement (the “EPDG Quality Agreement”) with EPDG for the purpose of defining and allocating the quality-related responsibilities between the Company and EPDG with respect to the production of the RiVax BDS under the EPDG Subcontract. After nearly three years of EPDG failing to meet the scope of work set forth in the EPDG Subcontract, Emergent recommended that both development and manufacturing work under the EPDG Subcontract be transferred to EMOB. On July 9, 2018, the Company entered into a quality agreement (the “EMOB Quality Agreement”) with EMOB, which agreement allocated various defined responsibilities between the Company and EMOB with respect to the manufacture, supply, and testing of the RiVax BDS. Under the EMOB Quality Agreement, EMOB assumed sole responsibility for, inter alia, (i) employee training; (ii) providing adequate and qualified personnel; (iii) notifying the Company of out-of-specification results within two (2) business days of identification of the out of-specification results; (iv) performing testing using agreed-to testing procedures, test methods, specifications, and required compendia requirements; (v) ensuring that EMOB-generated data was accurate, controlled and safe from manipulation or loss; (vi) ensuring that the procedures, the state of automation and/or management controls were in place to assure data integrity; (vii) apprising the Company of any significant changes to analytical methodology for intermediaries, in-process or final product; and (viii) assuring that samples were stored in appropriate, continuously monitored conditions. On January 8, 2020, EMOB informed the Company (a) of the existence of a questionable test result that could result in a determination that the RiVax BDS manufactured, tested and released by EMOB was out-of-specification and should never have been released by Emergent (b) that the validity of “initial release” test results for such BDS was faulty because Emergent used an improper test method. The Company immediately suspended the Phase 1c trial to evaluate RiVax in healthy adults, ending both further enrollment and further dosing. Emergent conducted an internal review of this deviation and found multiple internal failures including an “Inadequate analytical method transfer process,” an “Inability to comply with standard operating procedures around method transfer and data review,” and an “Inability to comply with test method procedures,” The Company quickly initiated a “for-cause” audit of the Emergent facility and confirmed the failures Emergent identified and admitted to in its own internal investigation. The Company is seeking to recover damages in excess of $19 million from Emergent. While the Company intends to vigorously pursue this arbitration, the Company cannot offer any assurances that it will recover any damages from Emergent."
This will start going down soon after open. No options sadly.
If it becomes successful it is a bonus for sure.
"Soligenix Announces Publication Demonstrating Successful Formulation and Heat Stabilization of Filovirus Vaccine Platform for Ebola and Marburg Virus Diseases Single-vial vaccine platform demonstrates high antibody levels against three lethal virusesPrinceton, NJ – August 23, 2021 – Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today a publication describing the formulation of single-vial platform presentations of monovalent (single antigen), bivalent (two antigens) and trivalent (three antigens) combinations of filovirus vaccine candidates. In collaboration with University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UHM) and University of Colorado (UC) co-authors, the manuscript entitled “Single-Vial Filovirus Glycoprotein Vaccines: Biophysical Characteristics and Immunogenicity after Co-lyophilization with Adjuvant”, has been published in Vaccine. The antigens and adjuvants used in this study have been previously demonstrated to protect non-human primates (NHPs) from subsequent infection. Lyophilization of the antigens within monovalent vaccine formulations has also been demonstrated to thermostabilize the antigens at temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to 12 weeks, enabling storage at ambient temperature. No currently licensed lyophilized vaccine that contains adjuvant is presented in a single-vial format and there are few reports of successfully using nano-emulsions in these lyophilized formulations. The published paper describes the use of a single-vial platform to co-lyophilize antigen(s) and a nano-emulsion adjuvant, CoVaccine HT, maintaining key adjuvant stability characteristics including particle size and colloidal stability. Further, antibody responses previously shown for monovalent vaccines were maintained in both mice and NHPs for the trivalent single-vial co-lyophilized vaccine candidates. Most recently, one of these trivalent formulations has also been shown to protect 75% of vaccinated NHPs against subsequent Sudan ebolavirus challenge, with further development to test efficacy against other filovirus infections ongoing. “Filoviruses such as Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg marburgvirus are some of the most lethal viruses known, and they are endemic in areas of the world where the power supply and distribution network can be uncertain. A thermostabilized vaccine in a single-vial format would significantly enhance any public health response to a new outbreak, at its source,” stated Axel Lehrer, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), UHM. “Our work to date has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid and efficient manufacturing, as well as the ability to thermostabilize multiple antigens that can then be stored at temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Having a vaccine platform available such as this has the potential to accelerate worldwide vaccination campaigns addressing future health emergencies, including another global pandemic like the one we are unfortunately experiencing with COVID-19.” “Our combined vaccine platform includes three major components: a robust protein manufacturing process that has been demonstrated on multiple protein antigens, a novel nano-emulsion adjuvant which induces broad immunity and a formulation procedure which enables thermostabilization of the combination of adjuvant and antigen in a single vial,” stated Oreola Donini, PhD, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Soligenix. “Elements of this vaccine platform have been utilized in our ricin toxin, filovirus and COVID-19 vaccine candidates, indicating its broad applicability. The ability to package the vaccine candidates in a single-vial platform further adds to their developability, whether as a multivalent or individual monovalent vaccine, particularly against Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus where there are currently no available vaccines.”"
"Very low valuation of 55 million --- 3 Products in Phase 3 -- Covid 19 vaccine program = One of the biggest opportunity in the sector with very very limited downside .

"A paper written on ""Forces That Move Stock Prices"" by David Harper is a good neutral paper to use in your factors in deciding the risk you will take and which variable will influence your decision. Further, It will help to decide whether the data SNGX has published is sufficient for you to invest for the first time, expand your holdings, hold or sell. So while I am invested in SNGX and read this board many times. I do not make decision based on these posts. I research each new fact on the stock or the market trends influencing stocks in general. But ultimately it is always your decision. The web has lots of false information and a lot of truthful information. The hard part for many is making sure you get the source information that is supported by fact. Good Luck.https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp"

Here we go again. Another PR as usual. Never saw a small biotech desperately pump out so many press releases. Most are a lot about nothing. Shabby should be worried if his p3 Hybryte clinical trial has enough accurate and robust data to be able to successful file an acceptable NDA without having it rejected or without ending up with a CLR. Have they yet shown the pictures of ALL the lesions in the p3 clinical trial?
"Tried jumping on the shareholder meeting and it was already done, anyone have feedback prior to the playback being available?"
"Pretty orderly trading here says a lot. Over 17M shares traded since the SGX942 news. I would guess anyone who wants out is out. Clearly some people want in. Why? Let's take a look at what we have:$40M cap, $20M cash, 2 yrs of runway, asset ready for NDA filing that can do $75M+ in the US, perhaps another $50-75M ROW, translating into $10-15M royalty revenue if licensed, so let's say $85M revenue total. 2X sales= $170M value ($5.7/share), 3x= $255M value ($8.5/share), 4x= $340M ($11.4/share). These are conservative sales multiples.The shoes have dropped, so no more identifiable bad news on the horizon. Near term possible news most likely positive. Here are some options: SGX301 partnership (which could surprise big time if partner will develop drug for psoriasis), sale of company, more CiVAX data, CiVAX traction and funding with/from government or partner, RiVAX data.So who thinks the risk:reward is positive and who thinks it is negative? Even if you hate Schaber and agree with all of Swenor's incessant ranting and raving, why would you sell here. I think we're looking at easy 2-3X. Worst case scenario, treads water for x months, you get bored, and you sell. I am betting on good news hitting and this stock moving. Holding and may add if stock keeps acting well."

"8/24/2021 - Soligenix: Developing Tools to Tackle the Next Potential Pandemic.SNGX Vaccines are known for the stringent cold chain storage requirements necessary to maintain their integrity. In the U.S., maintaining refrigerated or frozen conditions is a simple logistical hurdle. In developing nations, however, vaccine storage is a considerable challenge for the nearly three billion people who live in regions lacking temperature-controlled storage. As new vaccines are engineered, the development of thermally stable vaccines has lagged.Late-stage biopharmaceutical company, Soligenix (Nasdaq:SNGX), has shared preclinical data demonstrating that its thermostable vaccine platform may be an important contributor to addressing the next potential pandemic and future health emergencies.Key findings include:-- Demonstrated successful formulation and heat stabilization of filovirus vaccine platform published in Vaccine-- Potent efficacy data in monovalent (single antigen) and bivalent (two antigens) formulations demonstrated in non-human primates (NHPs) published in Frontiers in Immunology-- Efficacy of thermostabilized vaccine formulations in NHPs in single-vial presentation"

Harold. I agree.
"When I invest in stock I do check message boards to see if there is real data leads to help me quickly identify whether it is a stock to buy and hold until it meets my objectives. I consider myself an investor who looks for good potentials. While nothing is a guarantee. Madoff is the best example of fraud, the freezing of the Capital Markets is an example of something no one saw coming. And today we have Covid 19 effecting most business sectors. So there are three things I seek and SNGX has them plus more. Is there sufficient science that says FDA in the next 12 months, are there reliable external sources supporting the science, and what type of capital streams does it have. SNGX has high standard quality studies, two have reported out and one is expected in the 4th quarter. The delay enroll the required participants I fully understand due to Covid 19. It fit within the other delays I am seeing. The fact that NIH and other federal agencies are supporting these three studies says a lot and does not dilute share holders, the fact that New Jersey has continued to provided the tax credits and it does not dilute share holders, and the Russell Index add SNGX to the Microcap Index says it even more. I am not even addressing other treatments in their pipe line. This is a low price stock that has tremendous potential. Ignore the noise. And read the truth. To the folks that are throwing out irrational garbarge, it is the same message and old. The only thing it helps me with is to keep track of who they are and not invest in stock they pump. I am holding onto SNGX."
"the company will be announcing Phase 3 clinical data for SGX942 in oral mucositis (OM) before the end of 2020. Thus far, the stock has not responded favorably to the positive data for SGX301 in CTCL, which may indicate that investors are waiting on the OM data. However, i believe the stock is exceptionally undervalued at its current price, even if SGX301 was the only product in development. the current valuation is $15 and at the current depressed price we view an investment in Soligenix as offering a very positive risk/reward profile."
1.25? why? any news?

It’s groundbreaking science! It’s been around for decades and nobody applies it to thier vaccines.
SNGX after hours announcement ?I see no filings ???It is SMALL volume but all red
Nice move on Friday//three times the normal volume//with the market closing about even for the day. This action makes be believe NEWS Tuesday or some time next week!//Just my opinion!
Todd. I don't even read your mssgs. Please stop wasting other people's time.
We are now at a stage that I like the most. When the hype fades out and thereal value of the stock is shown by the new level of volume now 4 times the average.As you could see from the volume today people still want in on this stock but now there's a difference. I believe the vast majority of those at this stage who are holding now are dedicated long. I'll hold for at least 6 months and at that point make my move when the price is twice what it is now. Cheers to all longs and I'll let you know if a chart shows me something worth posting.
MM's are working it hard now but SNGX is going to go BULLISTIC today..! You'll all see... GO LONGS..!
The share price is absolutely makes no sense for their scientific break though findings in making 2nd better generation vaccines for COVID-19. The plate form is very valuable and can apply to other virus vaccines in the future. This company also has 2 phase 3 results coming and the products has no competition at all if approved by FDA. Why less than 70 million market cap? Why? I think it should $700 million.

"I think some folks not familiar with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and its current treatment were spooked by only greater than 50 percent sig response. This is better than existing PUVA treatment already approved, and importantly uses no damaging UV light like PUVA. The cycle 3 stage was to ensure safety; which it did. The sustained treatment effect is nice on top of that. As of today there are only palliative treatments for this disease. I am not an FDA official, but this should have a very strong chance for approval IMO."
SNGX obvious manipulation with +10-15% every pre-market & after-hours for the past 2 weeks. SNGX's crazy low share structure 40m says no more SELLers so low volume mainpulation looking to shake out some shares before the inevitable news near-term getting SNGX back over $2.50...IMO?

"SNGX 4/7 conditional FDA acceptance: ""Soligenix Receives Conditional FDA Acceptance of Proposed Brand Name HyBryte(TM) for SGX301 in CTCL 7:00 am ET April 7, 2021 (PR Newswire) Print Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conditionally accepted HyBryte(TM) as the proposed brand name for SGX301 (synthetic hypericin), the Company's novel first-in-class photodynamic therapy for first-line treatment of early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The name HyBryte(TM) was developed in compliance with the FDA's Guidance for Industry, Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names. The FDA's conditional approval validates HyBryte(TM) as a proprietary name that is consistent with the FDA's goal of preventing medication errors and potential harm to the public by ensuring that only appropriate proprietary names are approved for use. Final approval of the HyBryte(TM) brand name is conditioned on FDA approval of the product candidate, SGX301. ""We are pleased that the FDA has conditionally accepted the name HyBryte(TM) for SGX301,"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. ""This is yet another important step towards U.S. commercialization, as we continue to focus on submission of the rolling new drug application (NDA) in 2Q 2021 for this first-in-class therapy. SGX301 has already received Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. Additionally, SGX301 was granted Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Promising Innovative Medicine designation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom."" About Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) CTCL is a class of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a type of cancer of the white blood cells that are an integral part of the immune system. Unlike most NHLs which generally involve B-cell lymphocytes (involved in producing antibodies), CTCL is caused by an expansion of malignant T-cell lymphocytes (involved in cell-mediated immunity) normally programmed to migrate to the skin. These malignant cells migrate to the skin where they form various lesions, typically beginning as patches and may progress to raised plaques and tumors. Mortality is related to the stage of CTCL, with median survival generally ranging from about 12 years in the early stages to only 2.5 years when the disease has advanced. There is currently no cure for CTCL. Typically, CTCL lesions are treated and regress but usually return either in the same part of the body or in new areas. CTCL constitutes a rare group of NHLs, occurring in about 4% of the approximate 700,000 individuals living with the disease. It is estimated, based upon review of historic published studies and reports and an interpolation of data on the incidence of CTCL that it affects over 25,000 individuals in the U.S., with approximately 3,000 new cases seen annually. About HyBryte(TM) HyBryte(TM) (SGX301) is a novel first-in-class photodynamic therapy utilizing safe visible light for activation. The active ingredient in HyBryte(TM) is synthetic hypericin, a potent photosensitizer that is topically applied to skin lesions, is taken up by the malignant T-cells, and then activated by fluorescent light 16 to 24 hours later. The use of visible light in the red-yellow spectrum has the advantage of penetrating more deeply into the skin (much more so than ultraviolet light) and therefore potentially treating deeper skin disease and thicker lesions. This treatment approach avoids the risk of secondary malignancies (including melanoma) inherent with the frequently employed DNA-damaging drugs and other phototherapy that are dependent on ultraviolet exposure. Combined with photoactivation, hypericin has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative effects on activated normal human lymphoid cells and inhibited growth of malignant T-cells isolated from CTCL patients. In a published Phase 2 clinical study in CTCL, patients experienced a statistically significant (p=0.04) improvement with topical hypericin treatment whereas the placebo was ineffective. HyBryte(TM) has received orphan drug and fast track designations from the FDA, as well as orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA)."""
