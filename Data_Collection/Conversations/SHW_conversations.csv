Hi all. Richard can you better explain p/e.
"The Sherwin-Williams Company SHW logged earnings (as reported) of $4.46 per share in fourth-quarter 2020, up 67.7% from $2.66 in the year-ago quarter.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter were $5.09 per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.85.Sherwin-Williams posted revenues of $4,488.8 million, up 9.1% year over year. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,342.5 million.The SherwinWilliams Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise"
And down she goes but no worries good co good stock patience grasshopper
"Hey Lou, Shirley has been doing well lately...holding its own. Waiting to see the next earnings report; bothers me that there has been some insider selling, maybe Morikis is just taking some money off the table, can't blame him for that. But to your point, about SHW hitting 489 by the end of the year- yes, I think it will too. I just hope the 2nd quarter earnings don't tank the stock price in the near term."
Basam be patient. If the stock hits 558 I would buy more. My magic number. Last Jan 380. July 458. So I’m not upset. There still considered a buy and overvalued. I’m close to retiring so I want to subsidize w Shw dividends.
"SHW's looking good. Already hit 700- didn't think we'd see that until the end of the year. Buying on the dips. The next quarter's going to be a good one, so continuing to ramp up. Still think Shirley will have hit 800 by this time next year. Be nice to see a split, but it doesn't seem to need to do that to keep a good share price."
Shw today down alittle today $682.83. -$12.66. Please stick it out. It’s not Shw it’s global. Next dividend check around Dec 11th in time for Christmas gifts. I’d said:previous Shw will close the year around $680-710. I Now expect higher around $699-720. Shw is having a great performance year. Sept is typical a bad month for the stock market. Sept Oct I see Shw trailing alittle. But Nov Dec I’m expecting bonzana months. Looks like Shirley and I are long term investors looking at the bigger pic.
please split
How I feel about Sherwin Williams!
"Sherwin-Williams sets 3-for-1 stock splitBy Tomi KilgorePublished: Feb. 3, 2021, 8:11 a.m. EDTShares of Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) were indicated up more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday after the paints and coatings company said it will implement a three-for-one split of its common stock, effective April 1. The company said it was setting the stock split ""to make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader base of investors."" The stock split will be in the form of a stock dividend, payable March 31, with shareholders of record on March 23 receiving two additional common shares for each share they own. The stock closed Tuesday at $710.54, which would imply a post-split price of $236.85. The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trading, has rallied 23.6% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained 17.8%."
$259.12 new 52 week high today. Split at $246.00
"Let's see here. 31x earnings, Rising mortgage rates, rising oil prices (input), <1% dividend, very expensive commodity products. This stock has seen it's best days. Do yourself a favor and get out while you can. This pig is headed for slaughter.The only thing it has that I see positive is they exist in an oligopoly. Perhaps they can raise their paint prices from $65 a gallon to $100 to offset the increased input and distribution cost (oil) and decreased volume but this will likely decrease volume as well."
NEE announced split today. hope SHW announced as well
Love Wallstreets headlines that SW misses earnings & Market Watch’s “SW earnings take a hit” ? They met estimates as were counting decibels now if it’s good or not? Plus solid YOY numbers. These analysts are whacked out anyway. Look at how a company grows during difficult times and where they are headed.
"Stock splits mean absolutely nothing is a interesting comment Andrew. Ever hear of a company called Tesla or Apple? Apple would be $25K a share if never split and who would buy it? Tesla went from $1400 to over $4,200 if you aged back to pre split 5 months ago. I’ve owned S-W stock for 36 years since it was $19 a share and with 3 previous splits. No complaints here. I own all 3 and stock splits matter."
"Watch out, for the Sherwin-Williams bull. He hates that support gate…"
As shw ending the year at 582.17 +3.42. @ 1100. So the year started at 380. On July 19 I bought additional at 456. That about 26% returns. Ended prox 582.16 at prox 47% plus 0.78% dividends. Any complainers. I suspect next two weeks will be bad then the rest of the year should be great. Need to pass the 600 mark.
looking good!
"Lou et al, my bet is that if earnings are good later this month, that we're going to hit 267/sh (800/sh pre split) way early. Very pleased that the split has been very successful so far in allowing people who are in the labs (like I was), in the field, in the stores to participate in buying shares of the company that they work for- just like Lou, Shirley and bunch of us old timers were able to. Concerned that raw materials cost may hurt with increases in oil prices, but long term, I think things will stabilize."
MichaelM buy a share not a fraction. There are fees and commissions. If monies tight wait. I’ve never bought fractions your here to make money.
"Encouraging article from Barrons (Ben Levisohn) on the outlook for SHW as a good inflation hedge...I agree with Lou, I think that SHW will be $300-325/sh in 8 months.""If leading paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE: SHW) can raise prices without hurting sales, it can keep growing its profit margin even as input prices rise. So says Ben Levisohn's ""Why Sherwin-Williams Stock Has the 'Ultimate Hedge' Against Inflation."""
"I’m alittle disappoint. But…We’re in uncertain times. DIY aren’t spending there monies. With interstructures like in 2008:Shw has a lot of roads to stripe. Bridges and buildings to paint. SherwinLou still went up currently at $287.08 +$1.60. I’m keeping it all.,next 5 weeks Shw is flat. Then for the next 9 months zoom."
"Lou, Kindly reply.You held SHW thru thick and thin for more than 2 decades. What made You to have such a strong conviction on one stock for such a long time. You accumulated thousands of shares over the years. probably only .5% of investors might be so confident to hold a stock for so many years.Please share your tough times you had to go thru SHW and how did you overcome not selling during hard times. Lot of investors bail out at hard times. It is easy to hold a stock when it is going up. Having such great temparament is extremely rare and a great trait in investing world.Regards"
Nice power grab Morikis. “Mr. Sewell's Chief Operating Officer role will not be filled immediately. Mr. Morikis will serve as President in addition to his current role and assume Mr. Sewell's primary duties and responsibilities.”
"My bet is on Shirley having a bang up year in 2021. Share appreciation for two years running (Nov to Nov) has been on the order of 30%. The market likes stability. If Biden takes the presidency, and we have a check on the Democrats with a majority in the Senate that is a scenario favorable to Wall Street. We'll have a vaccine sometime late next year, and in the intermediate time frame we'll see the effects of a stimulus deal- which should be favorable to the markets. Hopefully Trump's economy has a little traction. This all bodes well for SHW which depends on building and consumer spending largely for profits. Wouldn't be surprised if we see share prices in the mid 800's (or higher) this time next year."
Hello basam. 2017 was an excellent year. Sales abroad are way down. Lowe’s is selling all Shw products. Ace is selling Shw Valspar. Shw is still about 4% higher than the other chemical companies. Shw dividends are ok. I have about 14k shares from 1985. I just bought another 70 shares the other day. If you buy shares of Shw before aug 23 then you’ll get those dividends on sept 6th. Also Shw and the other 2 big boys agreed to pay calif 305m / 3 over 6 years on lead abatement. Calif can’t ever go against the three ever again. Once Shw went down 10.69 I bought 70 more shares. Shw owns dutchboy. Martin senor. Pratt Lambert. Valspar. Minwax. Auto paints brands. Mexico branded paints. Purdue brushes the painters choice. Kylon spray. So many brands.
"I figured dec Jan will be bad months for Shw. Today 1/13 573.28 +6.19. 4th quarter results coming out prox around 1/30. As long as 4th quarters results come out good. Which I expect they will be good. Need to hit 600.00 and we’re good for the year. I think hopefully we lost the complainers manny moe and jack. Look I’ve been w Shw since 1985. I swore I wouldn’t buy more Shw but I did on 7/19 at 458. Look at the price in 6 months. from 1985 there are about 14,000 shares. I’m sticking with it."
After reading the full article from S-W they are only slightly lowering 3rd Qtr sales guidance low single digit and income remains unchanged. Full year guidance sales and income remain unchanged. Doesn’t seem that drastic to me?
"I did a remodel last year and asked my contractor which paint he preferred and he said he doesn't use anything but Sherman Williams and neither do his friends. I asked why and he said that's what you use if you don't want any complaints. I thought that was an interesting response, so I checked the stock price and it was $712 a share. Wow... couldn't believe that! Ended up picking some shares on a whim and very happy so far after the spilt. That's all I got..."

PPG competitor to SHW did way better this year. Any reason why? I am long on SHW
Yes I'm also not happy about the last three quarters... but shw had a big big expense on lowes. getting shw into lowes. lots of product. literature. mixers. tinters. etc. I know chris conners personally and Morikis. both good guys. if you have some ideas instead of just critizing post them. new construction is up. lowes is online now. Valspar is online also. Richard do you own any stock or are you just unemployed and want to critize. I expect Shw to end the year around 480.xx
Hello Basam. Also Shw owns krylon spray. Minwax. Purdy brushes and accessories the painters choice. I remember when Shw was buying purdy kelly Moore said they’ll drop the line. Ex ceo Chris conners said go adhead drop purdy your painters will come to Shw for purdy and we’ll sell more paint to them. Kelly Moore never dropped the line. Kelly Moore ceo joe c came from Shw. Trained by Shw. Have you ever looked at Shw product development. I worked there for a few weeks way back then. Taught me a lot.
GEEZ! Went up too fast I guess and profit takers today.
SHW shorts are on a suicide mission. Stay at home is good for this stock. More people working on home improvement projects and that means huge demand for SHW's paints. Bought on the pandemic floor and have a massive gain but I've owned for several years now. Very glad I chose this stock over PPG which has given me diddly squat of a return over the past several years. Shorts are in for massive pain betting against this company.
So if I buy now will it be as I buy the split ??
Today new all time high 492.26.... 
Do you know who comes up w the earnings numbers.
Now it’s down -3.79.
"Shirley had a great year in 2019. Lou, I think that there is a lot of optimism regarding the economy which translates into residential building which means that they'll buy a lot of paint- 2020 will be a good year. Even though the P/E is very high, there is still upside momentum on share price. Wish they'd increase the dividends- a little stingy there."
"Seems like Jerry, Richard and eddy don’t say anything when Shw is doing really good. Jerry selling financials at trade reports. Richard and eddy I don’t think they have stocks just complaining. Complain complain complain."
The SHW Bull kicking the Support gate and Mr. Market aside.
Here comes the nose dive. How can you be at all time highs with MAJOR supply and raw material issues?? You can’t …

I noticed when my dad bought paint they shrank the paint size . Good way to tick off customers.
Good NEWS!Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Raises Quarterly Dividend 23.1% to $1.65
"This stock is done. Low relative growth potential, paltry dividends. Who wants to buy this?"
At 8:01am SW was down only $1.54 on yahoo finance and then went blank again? This is crazy or Yahoo fake news?
"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Sherwin-Williams (SHW). Shares have added about 6.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sherwin-Williams due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts."
"One more thing. To add to my comment from yesterday, and this is important for the folks like Basam and Rajan who are looking to get in. These hedge funds that are buying SHW shares have very sophisticated research tools and do deep dives into a company. Regular people don't have these kinds of tools to analyze stocks. But what we CAN do is follow what they're doing- the only danger is we get caught real bad when they sell, which when they do, they do big. The good thing about Shirley, is she's a great long rider- great business model, committed to a core industry, well managed. So my advice is to buy and hold. My bet is that they're going to have a great 3rd quarter earnings result- we may see 800/share sooner than we thought."
This is now the time to buy Shw. Shw today $251.70. -$7.25After hrs $252.00. +0.30. After hrs is a possible indicator for tomorrow.
What is the date you have to own the stock by to get the three for one split?
Stock Buyback...Increased Dividend...and a Stock Split.Seems to be Firing on All Cylinders to Me!.......
"Lou,I am thinking if I should buy more at these levels or wait.Same with Master card. as of today it dropped 18% from highs"
"@Bemo- Interesting analyis, thank you. Bemo noted in his response to Yefri that the 9 period moving average got too far ahead of the 23 period moving average. I think he's right. Likely fund investors took some profit that offset the gain we would have seen from a great quarter. Fundamentals are good...hanging on to a great company!"
I wouldn’t see any shares. I have about 14k shares from 1985.. I bought an additional 70 shares around July 2019 at about 468.. I bought when shw agreed to pay 100m in 5 years to state of ca for lead. That calif could never sue again. There a pull back. I took advantage. 4.52 in dividends. I’m expecting shw to close the year around 530-560. Be in it for the long haul. I have and prospered. It’s split 3x since I’ve had it. I got it cheap. Today trading 550.52+.
I agree with Shirley. Shw is bullish. Current and 9+ months up.
nice raise.. thx
I bought in at 33.00.. my quarterly dividends are much more than I ever put into it. Korean dance. Stock needs to split. Last time was around 1995.
God I Love this stock!.....

"From recent Motley Fool Article, some good news and reason to look forward to a good earnings report later this month. ""The fourth quarter is a seasonally weak one for the business, but executives still see the faster growth trends sending sales higher in the low single digits for the full 2020 year. That forecast had called for flat revenue in late July.""""The picture is even brighter on earnings, which are now set to land between $21.49 and $21.79 per share, up from the prior prediction range of $16.46 to $18.46 per share. While investors will have to wait until early 2021 for a detailed outlook on the new fiscal year, management sounded optimistic about the broader growth potential. """"There is tremendous opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses,"" Morikis said, ""and in many ways we're just getting started."""
"Looks like we begin our climb out of the hole. Hope y'all were able to use that drop as a buying opportunity (or at the very least, didn't sell). When the price drops on a pair of shoes that you've been wanting, you use that opportunity to buy those shoes. Same for stocks - buy when it goes on sale. That's my free lesson for the day to some of the folks who are newer to trading."
"Sherwin Williams is have shortage problems on chemicals to make paint! Mainly LATEX from Texas. The terrible freeze from last winter effected the latex production and they can’t get enough to make paint!! Also, they can’t get base carpet due to carpet makers can’t get latex used to attach carpet action backing! SHW is a major supplier of carpet to the apartment and builder industries!"
"What ever you do, don't listen to Richard."
is it a good time to add more positions to SHW? or is it better to wait for further drop?
"A couple things to consider- Rajan was wondering why the share price and the P/E multiple are so high. Hedge funds buy SHW big time, this drives the price up, and really the funds are betting big on SHW future earnings. (I personally think the acquisition of Valspar is the big factor here, but I don't know. Lou might have a better handle on this than me).Another thing is low interest rates, stocks are a more attractive investment when interest rates are low, and some funds borrow to buy stocks- and interest rates are low. SHW is a very well managed, diversified in coatings and stores, and a buttoned-down company that has made some shrewd business moves lately. SHW is not the only company doing well that is really expensive- take a look at Amazon, GOOGLE (Alphabet), and Microsoft..."
Does SHW stand to benefit from the Infrastructure bill if passed?
"Yefri, This is a great stock, in two weeks, I’m up, just shy of $19 a share. You, must have a short position? and you’re on the wrong side of the trade. SHW will go ."
I wish it splits. so I can more. sometimes it is hard to afford to buy even a single stock. I have SHW 9 PERCENT of my portfolio
"Bezos can take New Shepard to space, but Morikis is taking Sherwin-Williams to the moon."
No flat paintNo primersNo Promar Ceiling Paint! Ugh!Beginning of summer and paint is scarce. Not good.Great company but there's a dip coming.
"Shirley Williams was a rocket today, how 'bout it!! My view is for this kind of movement, it's obviously the hedge funds moving in. And yes, the P/E ratio is quite high and there are raw materials uncertainties, but there is something driving it; and no, I do not think they fudged their numbers for the last quarterly report. It's just well managed, that's all. We'll see what the next earnings bring. It's going to hit 300 before Oct, maybe a pull back first, but it'll hit it. Interesting to see how it finishes the year."
Trade war with China. Sherwin Williams is such a big company. Does it import and raw material from china to make the paints or what I am trying to ask is how does the trade war with china effect this company?I bought stocks around May/June 2019. Happy so far. Read about acquistions that SHW has made and looks like this is great company and managment. Historical returns are also great.thank you
I am going to buy 20 shares at the open tomorrow- Does that sound good?
"CLEVELAND, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) today announced it has signed an agreement to acquire the European industrial coatings business of Sika AG. The transaction is expected to close in the beginning of 2022. Based in Germany with additional sales and technical support in Poland, Austria and Switzerland, Sika's European industrial coating business engineers, manufactures and sells corrosion protection coating systems for high value interior and exterior steel infrastructure, bridges, airport and rail, wind and energy, chemicals, power transmission and stations, interior linings for oil and gas tanks, vessels, and pipework, and water and wastewater applications, along with fire protection coating systems to protect and preserve steel, wood and concrete building components. Sales of the business were approximately CHF 75 million ($82 million) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquired business will become part of the Company's Performance Coatings Group operating segment. Approximately 130 Sika employees are expected to join Sherwin-Williams.""This transaction fits our strategy of acquiring complementary, high-quality, differentiated businesses that add to our profitable growth momentum,"" said Sherwin-Williams Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John G. Morikis. ""The business brings us scale, unique technology, a strong sales and marketing team, technical service capabilities, strategically located manufacturing, and leading specification and approval positions, all of which we can leverage further throughout Europe and other regions across the world. Additionally, synergy opportunities give us great confidence in accelerating the already strong financial performance of the business. We look forward to officially welcoming Sika's industrial coating employees to Sherwin-Williams upon the close of the transaction at the beginning of next year."""
"This has got to be one of the safest stocks to own. Been around for 150+ years (not many companies can say that) and the largest paint and coatings company in the world. Sure there is some competition in PPG, Benjamin Moore, RPM and Behr, but society will ALWAYS need paints and coatings. I don't think we have to worry about paints and coatings being replaced by some other technology."
"can't lose with Sherwin, it's in the name."

LouI looked at the stock price historical graph from 1986. SHW runs (this is normal for every stock) upwards for few years and I don't know the right word to say but either it consolidate/runs sideways for few years.From 1997 april to 2003 March it went sideways. stock didnt go anywhere. Again from 2007 July to DEc 2009 sideways.Now it is again in uptrend. May be that is how SHW works. So I think I should wait and buy more in dips during sideways mode. any opinions are greatly appreciated.thank you

"Sherwin-WilliamsWatching paint dry is famously boring. Owning shares of the leading paint retailer isn't.Sherwin-Williams has been a fantastically profitable business for shareholders in recent years. The stock jumped nearly 900% since mid-2011, in fact. Add dividend payments to that mix and you have a nearly 1,000% return in 10 years compared to 300% for the S&P 500. Sherwin-Williams checks all the important investing boxes. It maintains dominant market share in an attractive, growing industry. It has a proven ability to raise prices at a higher rate than inflation, and a proven ability to boost dividends through any kind of market.Its management team has shown a knack for effective capital allocation, too, whether it's through stock repurchases, debt financing, or large acquisitions like the Valspar merger. That strategic asset should help keep returns rising even after the current boom times end.But there's no sign of that slowdown yet. Sales jumped 12% in the most recent quarter. Executives are predicting even faster gains when Sherwin-Williams reports Q2 earnings in late July."
Even Joe Biden can't kill this stock! Bad day for the markets...sheesh.
Shw hitting new highs. Dividends first part of dec. just before the holidays. 565. 567. What happened to the complainers Richard and Eddie. Did they ever own any stock. Ytd Shw has gained about 38-39%. Plus dividends.
"@BEV Fan, don't think this ship is sinking- not with a 25% appreciation in share price/last calendar year. Turnover at SHW has always been high, I worked for Shirley 30+ years ago and it was the same in those days. Just the nature of the industry, and granted, SHW was never particularly easy on its employees.Having said that, the last several years have seen some incredible growth for a mature company in a very staid industry. From everything that I've read, we're looking at a good year in 2021 too. Let's see what Thursday's announcement says, that'll be interesting..."
"C.J.,don't want to brag.I bought my first shares @ $8.46 a share 30 + years ago by accident.I was hired by C.T.S. (S/W's private fleet) and the management at that time were transfers from S/W accounting and billing departments all with over 20+ years in.I can still hear Mr.MaGaral saying ""This stock plan is one of the best benefits Sherwin-Williams has to offer.""And still is."
This stock is an animal. Opened lower and an opportunity to add to my holdings. Will close higher.
Hi Richard. Shw Target end of the years is $792.05. There a very conservative company.
"I'm left speechless. Chris Connor deserves much credit for laying the groundwork of an expanded global company. In my years, truly Sherwin Williams grew into the ""cover the earth"" symbol that it has worn for so long. Good company, good products, dedicated employees with talented leadership."
It is about time for Sherwin-Williams to split the stock.
Does anyone know why S-W is down $21.79 and 7% after hours as of 6:38pm ??? This stock has only moved as much as 7% on a very rare occasion. Or is this just another weird after hours / pre market price on yahoo finance this stock seems to always show?
3 days ago Richard said sell now it was going to $360...how's $450 sit with ya Rich?
"Do you know you can invest in SHW for as little as $10.00 a month? Its called DRS. You have to buy one share of SHW through your online broker. You then call your brokers DRS department and ask them to transfer the share to SHW transfer agent (Equiniti). Once it arrives at Equiniti, you set up your banking information and can invest once a month for as little as $10.00 a month. It doesn't cost you a dime and dividend reinvestment is also free. I only own .206 shares, but this will be a good chunk of change 20 years from now!"
"A lot of talk about splitting the stock- certainly good arguments for at least a 2:1 split. I would say that as a long time holder of SHW, the stock has done very, very well despite a high share price. My opinion only, is that a higher stock price does dampen volatility to some extent- with a high share price the stocks are largely taken up by funds and by backs by Shirley herself. This takes a lot of speculation out of play, and really helps with stability."
"Shirley recently gets stalled at the 734-735 price point, share price seems to settle at that level, but not hold above that point- my bet is profit taking and a high P/E. Don't think that it will stay there, especially after the next earnings in Jan, once earnings is demonstrably higher. Patience is a virtue LOL!"
Feels good to be over $300! Let's keep going!
"Look for an earnings miss and $30 drop Tuesday, unfortunately. Still a great long but going to be a tough next 36 months"
What happened this morning? SHW was up to $724.99 briefly before the bell.
"I also expect SHW to close about $700 this year, especially if they have a good earnings announcement in late Oct. A price range about $800, as Lou mentions, is a pretty reasonable estimation- it represents on the order of a 14-15% increase from a jump off point of 700/sh. That's not unrealistic goal given what it's done historically. I think the benefits of the Valspar acquisition are starting to kick in; this combined with a string housing market will certainly help with domestic sales.The bit about the split. Do agree that a share price of 700-800 is high, Shirley really should think about splitting the stock- not sure why they haven't. The only thing that would go against this move is moving the price into a range where speculators jump in and wreck havoc and cause volatility. There is a benefit to keeping share prices high. But the share price should not be so high that people who want to buy in for a long term investment, like Basam, are put off. Maybe they'll rethink this."
Shw split at $246.00. Estimate end of the year at $291.28 plus dividends. That’s real good we’re talking 9 months. Shw is also BULLISH. So Manny Moe and Jack since you don’t have any shares anyway and the short sellers just get out. Seems. Shirley Richard Bassam myself and soo many others have the Karma and profits in our pockets.
Jeff. You don’t like pre market down what about pre market up. From 380 Jan 1st to now I hope you not complaining. 50% up. Do you own any shares.
The coming boom in housing construction and sustained number of home improvement projects will skyrocket demand for SHW and PPG's paints. SHW has returned way more than PPG over the last 5 years so I own only SHW. The stock even after its amazing run still trades at a reasonable valuation here and has more upside IMO. The stock split should only help their situation. There is no bear case on the home improvement companies right now with where we are in the cycle of the housing market.
Bassam Shw will split. Since I’ve had it... it split 3x. Shw hit $659.87. Closed $633.89. +$8.46. I’m not greedy. I’m ok w those numbers.
Where’s manny moe n jack. On a Dow down day Sherwin s @ 296.23. +$0.25. Sherwin is Bullish.
Whenever S-W dips 5% or more it’s a buy. This stock fell to 330s in March when market crashed and 723 today. What else can you say? Yesterday is a mystery as I’ve owned this stock for over 35 years had 3 splits and started buying at $11. I’m very happy with S-W as it always beats the odds.
Someone asked about Shw vs PPG. I’ve worked for both. Company stores gone w ppg. I like ppg but there upper line paint. Manor hall. Shw is much bigger. Ppg was bigger but they quit growing. The sleeping giant. Ppg stands for Pittsburgh paints and glass. Both have a good coatings line including epoxies. Shw has a larger line. Much better distribution. Minwax is owned by Shw. Same as krylon spray paint lines. They own about 95% of that business. Also Shw can put any color into spray cans. Great for touch ups.
"Long term investors like Lou or Richard. Question for you good folks.I am looking at the balance sheet of SHW. Total revenues for 2019 is 18 billion roughly. But cash and equivalents in only 161 million. How come it is so low?They usually say, one should invest in companies with strong balance sheet with lots of cash. I am just trying to pick your brains guys since You have been long term holders. was this small amount of cash was any time an issue for SHW?Even though the total shares on float is only 90 million the EPS is only 16$. I did read that SHW bought valsper all cash for 13 billion. could that be the reason they don't have much cash on the books?I am trying to understand the numbers before I put more into SHW. I am comparing it other industrials (not same sector) like Roper technologies (ROP). Cash on hand is in billions. Even though the float is around 500 million (way more than SHW) the EPS is 17$ in 2019. thank you"
"The best thing that could happen to this company, it’s stock prices and investors at these new found levels is a stock split. 3:1 split at least. You could even do APPLE numbers and go 7:1. Make this more available to the everyday investor. The brand speaks for itself and has proved it can weather any storm and outperform the S&P... Now, lets get some SERIOUS money pouring in."
Noah - I agree  % !!!Whoever knocks this company about its stock has not done their homework back to 1981 when then CEO Jack Breen started an incredible stock run that is still going. “Cover The Earth” !
"@BEV Fan- Agree that it is a good long term hold. Far too soon to consign the stock price, however, to the 600's- maybe it will hit high 600's, but not going to stay there. Company buy backs will likely help in that regard, also we need to see the effect of the split. It'll hit 800 before the end of 2021, up to you if you want to stay for the ride- maybe you're a short seller? Great company with a great product; going to to fine."
It just happens. It’s been going up almost every day. It’s been bullish now bearish. Still next 9 months is up.
ER missed in revenue. stock is down 5%. that is big drop since I have been holding since May 2019. but I will stick to it.Hopefully it will come back. I missed revenue in the last 4 quarters consequently according to seekalpha.com. Hopefully things will change around in revenues
"@Andrew, where do you get all this inside information? My bet is that you don't know s...t and you're a shorter and trying to talk the stock down."
"it's paint, at a 37 P/E ratio. competition will eat it's juiced-up stock valuation flesh soon. not gonna be pretty for the long haul."
"I'm wondering how much of this recent fall is related to new construction slowing down. I heard lumber prices are finally coming back down but it's going to take a few weeks for the wholesale market to recognize that drop. Hopefully when the market sees lower lumber prices, new construction will increase and so will the SHW stock price."
Anyone notice at 4:07 after hours S-W was up $39.65 to $799.50???????
"Morgan Stanley interviewed the CEO of SHW; based on a discussion of the business model and trends, Morgan Stanley increased the price target estimate of SHW to 345 from 315. Based on the share appreciation that we've seen since the split, that sounds feasible..."
"Is Sherwin-Williams's (NYSE:SHW) 111% Share Price Increase Well Justified?The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) which saw its share price drive 111% higher over five years. It's down 2.4% in the last seven days. While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Sherwin-Williams, it has a TSR of 122% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Sherwin-Williams shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 17% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper."
What a day! “Cover The Earth” my SW friends!
they crushed earnings. shouldn't this be up by 5%?
New high 516.43.. where are the complainers.
Been long and continue to be. I think low 270's is fair based on valuations/ business/ sentiment of kingmakers pre-split. Good luck
I think for the short term current price of 250.95 is too high when the end of the year estimate is $263.47 plus dividends. But I also think there end of the year estimate is low. Shw rather be conservative. Shw is also bullish which is a great thing.
"Lou,the outstanding total share for sHW is 92 million according to yahoo finance. Thats very few number of shares in the market. is that one of the reason why the stock went up all the way to 590$ (recently)?"
Shw exceeded earnings. Stocks down for 2-6 weeks. This is the time to look for a dip and buy in and more. Split was on april 1st at $246.00. Currently at $265.93 -3.61. Typical for Corp America to beat earnings and the stock goes down. But then way up. 2-6 weeks watch for dips and buy in.
PPG news having an affect on SHW. I wonder if Sherwin will have same troubles?
"So I am an analyst and this is a stock I really don't understand. It's 37x earnings off of what has to be the best history for the housing market possible, pays no dividend, has a marginal net profit margin in a cyclical industry. Can you write gap down any bigger. Rates rise a little and this sucker is toast.Oil prices rising increase input costs and transportation. Housing market seems to be wobbling for the first time in years.Earnings being cut in half and a realistic p/e of 15 on this pig put it 1/4 the current price.The only thing is has going for it is that they have created an Oligopoly. How the government allows this is beyond me. They sell paint for $50 plus a gallon. When do people say enough on ridiculous prices?Sell this pig while you can."
Looks like SEC will be investigating as to why SHW stock jumped 22% in last hour of trading Wednesday when they didn't release positive news until 8:00 am Thursday morning.
How’s the competitive moat here? Worried about private-label products from the likes of HD and LOW? Will this company’s market position be just as strong in 20 years???
Hi basam. Shw actually going up about $6:every three days.
"Big mistake to sell into dips- just a word to newer SHW investors...good company, very resilient. And as Pete notes below, Barrons just raised end of year share price guidance to $320. Been a share holder for many, many years, this is not something to panic over. This is a buy and hold stock, and a stock to BUY on the dips. It'll be back, economy has a lot of steam left."
Stock drop today is most likely due to retiring and terminates employees cashing out. 2020 will go down as the highest employee exodus in company history. Valspar management is stinking up the place bad. Most long term legacy SW employee have been forced out or taking early retirement. Not sure why the failed management from the acquiree company has so much power to change the SW culture.
Sorry haven’t been in conversations. I did not sell any of my shares. Quite a few thousand shares when I was working for them in the 80s. Paid like 0.23. Split 3x. Then last year I bought more at 458. It hit 603 something today. Closed at 594 something. Dividend check next week. Did you notice Shw and HDepot follows the same graph pattern.
I understand SHW is a solid company with good Mgmt but $620...wow! What is driving such a premium?
Who cares what the stock does pre market as long as it keeps going up??? I’ve even mentioned the odd pre market in past and maybe it’s a yahoo finance glitch? Who knows who cares as I’m with Lou that this could go 300-350 by EOY. Then it will probably level off a while.
This is what I tire of in this conversations. Complainers. If you don’t like Shw we’ll move on. Current to the end of the year looks excellent. The complainer of the money for Morrison house. Your a complainer. The stockholders the real stockholders seem to be happy w real results and products from Shw. The three stooges are the complainers. I have a very very nice dividend check coming next week.
Did I miss big news or a press release somewhere? What in the world is driving today's surge? I don't remember the last time I saw their stock increase this much in one day.
Hello bassam Richard Shirley. I’m expecting after the split it may go down alittle. Very little. We’re dancing again this morning. $745.84. No complainers who never had any shares. The short sellers.
Shw was bullish.. then neutral. Now bearish.
Well so much for my comments yesterday #$%$W follows PPG lead and lowers their guidance. Down another - $6.84 pre market. Yikes!
Why is S-W continuing to tank after they reported higher guidance for Q2 and full year and several other analysts raising their targets as high as 320. Nothing but great news? The other comment about them closing stores and having no tint is wrong. Probably a store forget to order enough tint was the issue. The raw material shortage is improving week by week.
"Lou, Basam, Mike et al, not sure what the hell happened yesterday...One guess that I have is that Shirley reached a sell price point for a hedge fund, and they liquidated all their SHW assets to move into more depressed stocks that were held down by COVID. When it was announced that the vaccine had been developed, and the market was recovering like crazy (which we knew that it would), they moved out.Still, the fundamentals for Shirley are really good- with the caveat that the P/E is very high, but so are many good quality stocks. Not sure what a reasonable P/E is anymore.Anybody else have any ideas about what went down yesterday?"
"Down again. I’m going to add a few more shares today! My feeling is they are bringing it down, which gives it more upside here after earnings."
I was wondering why S-W down so much with only good news as Morgan Stanley raised target and sees 12% increase. Plus S-W already gave their guidance for rest of year. PPG doesn’t run a tight ship like S-W and investors shouldn’t lump same type companies together and wait for S-W to change their guidance rather than speculate before panic mode.
"This stock has been phenomenal the last 15 years, but I don’t know what it has left in the tank. Not a growth stock and not a high yield dividend stock either, so what is it? Maybe the share repurchasing and paying down Valspar debt might be able to right the ship. The split told me there is limited price movement going forward. I hope I’m wrong because I do love this stock and not ready to bail just yet"
Hello all. Hi Richard. Shirley. Bassam. Andrew your talking nonsense. So we got manny moe and jack back. Shortens prob don’t own any shares.People leave all the time. Name. Position. Monies. I look at the 3/1 split as neither good or bad. But more intelligent investors w get into Shw. Pumping the price.I orig paid 0.23. 1985. $465 2019. Where are we now $676. The 23.1% dividend is good. Nobody has the paint line or the distribution like Shw. This month w the stock splits I’m hoping around $675-680. Then the split $225-230. End of the year $300 would make me happy. Most stocks today are making there earnings and then going down. Look at Costco. Walmart. And soo many others. Down after earnings.
I don't hear anything from Richard or Eddy late. SHW at 443.15 today to finish the year at 488-495.
Shw still doing great. Split 4/1 @ $246 to current $273.99. Stay the course.
If people aren't going into HD then I wouldn't risk buying...
PPG is also down 3.82% after hours?
"How can it be that SW reported increase in revenue when their Texas plant shut down from the freeze, they did not mention this fact, I’m a contractor and in June I had to buy 100gals of primer from HD and 80gals of finish from Pittsburgh, SW was out of primer n flat finish as well as other products. Did they cook the books???"
Sherwin Williams has outstanding financial statements and that's what we should pay more attention to. Hurricane Ida is not going to last forever and will not affect the business long term.
The freeze in Texas and a shortage of titanium that's used in most paints is the biggest issue..let's hope it can be resolved..also a strong demand for paint and the manufacturing can't keep up
Shw is a very conservative company.Shw is expecting to end the year at 489.75.They’ve raised that number a few times this year. I was surprised I bought this week another 70 shares of Shw.In 1985 it was like 0.32 and Shw gave me a lot of free stock. I put in approx 2k. Now worth about 6m. The shame of it all was is taking the dividends. If I hadn’t it’d be worth a lot more. But I didn’t throw away the dividends I bought other shares of other companies. You can’t look at just today how it’s doing. You have to look how it’s performed indicating how it should go. Board of directors are a very conservative group. There are a few on here that prob don’t have any Shw stock and just bad mouth them. But then they’ll tell you to go to their site and get a free download. They’re selling services. Pain in the xxx.
"Lou- I hear you. I think we're going to have a splendid earnings report tomorrow- for a very dicey economy right now, the leaders at Shirley have been doing a very, very good job."
March 23.
"2 months ago did eddy say...... and I quote..... expensive, low margin and dividend, high debtHope you sold two months ago."
"I am a painting contractor and they can no longer supply me with the paint I’ve been using for 10 years for numerous reasons including the freeze in Texas labor shortage and now they’re saying they’re only making paint for commercial in new homes so I’m taking my $10,000 a year business to Home Depot￼"
Basam. Also 2018 across the board the market was down. So Shw didn’t do well. 2019 it can’t make up its mind. My biggest stock is Shw. Followed by Walmart. Costco. Proctor and gamble. Visa. MasterCard. Homedepot.
I’m sticking with it. I think it was the short sellers.

"As a new homeowner, I have been doing alot of painting. I finally got to see that Sherwin Williams paint is superior. I am mostly using HGTV Home Showcase paint by Sherwin Williams (Lowe's) for both the ceiling and walls. Great first coat coverage, dries fast and no paint coming off the wall when 3m painters tape removed. Now compare this with Glidden Paint by PPG (Home Depot). First coating not as great, takes longer to dry and a couple of areas the paint came off during tape removal.Sure, you are looking at $19 a gallon (PPG) vs. $35 a gallon (SHW), but it's well worth it.Proud to be SHW share owner."
"Lou, Shirley has done well this year, very well- how can you argue with a 39% gain in one year. Here's hoping she hits her numbers on Tuesday. BTW, I'm not the Richard that talks it down, but sometimes it SHW does disappoint me when she doesn't hit her earnings."
"$SHW UP $10 ON BABY BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.I OWN BOTH BUT ALOT MORE OF SHW...LETS KEEP ROLLING...BUY, HOLD, DRIP"
I wonder how much down SHW can go.
"Shares of Sherwin-Williams Co. were indicated up more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday after the paints and coatings company said it will implement a three-for-one split of its common stock, effective April 1. The company said it was setting the stock split ""to make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader base of investors."" The stock split will be in the form of a stock dividend, payable March 31, with shareholders of record on March 23 receiving two additional common shares for each share they own. The stock closed Tuesday at $710.54, which would imply a post-split price of $236.85. The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trading, has rallied 23.6% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 17.8%."

"@AB- P/E is high, but take look at other companies that are doing well (e.g. AAPL), their P/E's are high too. The whole market is high, and how much higher it'll go is a matter of debate.Now, about SHW. Disagree completely with you, it will be around for the long haul- in fact that's how you make money in this stock; not by trading, but by buying, holding, reinvesting dividends. Several things to consider 1. SHW has been historically well managed. Generally a conservative management team that doesn't take too many unwarranted risks; 2. Has made or beat its earnings numbers now (with the exception of last quarter's very narrow miss) for how many quarters?; 3. It's acquisition history- very smart move with Valspar and other companies; it also know when to divest unprofitable groups; 4. Stock buy back history- dividends tend to be low, but the company supports its share price; 5. Infrastructure Bill and housing market. Going to be big for coatings. Even if the economy takes a downturn, people still paint their houses."
No brainer.Added to my position (stock sold off) as they gave us a preview of the numbers going into earning on the 27th showing strength and increased sales and better then expected EPS.
Stock splits mean absolutely nothing. I remember Chris Connor former CEO saying this at a sales meeting and he would not split SW at the time. Said it costed a bunch of money for the paperwork. It does not make it any easier for employees and investors with less money. You tell me the difference--1 share at 700----2 shares at 350---or 3 shares at 233. No difference whatsoever.
"The best paint, the stores are super easy and save so much time. I’m in and out ASAP, whenever I need paint I go to the local Sherwin Williams instead of Home Depot or Lowe’s."
"It may not make a difference for NIO (atleast for couple of years) whether Tesla can sell their cars in China or not. Nio has enough backlog orders to keep itself improving production and delivery targets. Moreover, NIO has advanced in Battery swaps and its infrastructure, top-class product and a strong management to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. I personally experienced few organization excelling in the very competitive environment though they had their leaps and bounces. $SHW (Sherwin Wiliams) is a paint company and the industry so competitive. SHW has proved with strong management they can grow astronomically even in a very competitive environment. Even in last one year SP went up by $300 or more. Another one is CMG (Chipotle). They went down drastically in 2017 - 2018 with frequent food poisoning issues. Many doubted their chance in the market. However, new strong management came in 2018 and turned it into a thriving stock and reached highs of $1500 plus range from 300 range in 2017- 2018.I believe NIO has all the potential to grow 10 folds within the next 3 or 4 years"
"Animals are treated better than employees of The Sherwin-Williams Company. The turnover rate is ridiculous. I worked 30 years for them and helped launch a significant program with a major retailer. A few days after the Valspar acquisition my employment was terminated along with many others, A disgrace while the top executives stuff their pockets. Sales goals in many instances are unattainable. This company should be investigated. It reminds me of a large bank in this country that treated lower level employees horrible as the top brass became filthy rich. This is the same company about 10 years or so ago that got caught short changing their employees 401k plans and had to reimburse them all. It was a significant amount to me to the tune of $10,000.00."
Both labor and inventory issues are causing Shirley stock decline.
Shw is bearish. Expected to close end of the year $738.32. I would of been happy at $680-720. I’m thrilled. Next 9+ months ++++
How does this company with second rate products continue to make money ?
With the Dow down 22 points Shw is only down -2.36. So we’re good.
"Lou, Bassam- Shirley did well with a beat today. EPS of 6.57...(estimate was 6.35); good on them! I've been critical of the SHW management when EPS did not expectations, but this is a very good thing (Lou, do you think they were listening? LOL). I think the Valspar acquisition is starting to get some traction, and stores continue to do well."

"Andrew...RESPONSIBLE replies only please. Define ""miserable"" environment. Sewell is in the executive suite. It's an entirely different world there. WestRock has a choppy stock chart, significant debt and is in an industry that's quite challenging (paperboard and related products). Sherwin basically has a monopoly in paint and some coatings categories, so I'm questioning why he left. So if anyone out there, especially someone with accurate insights, would care to comment, it would be appreciated."
"Allen J. Mistysyn -- Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial OfficerAnd here's the -- as you know, as the year goes on, if we see raw material costs increasing more than what we have planned or what we have in our guidance. You know us, we have discipline, and we'll go out with another price increase. You saw that kind of 2011, 2012, when we had to go out with five price increases in the 18-month period, that discipline is still there. And if we're not covering our costs, we'll have to go out again. But right now, we feel comfortable with the price increases that are going into the market.Industrial customers love multiple price increases each year. Should be a winning strategy to lose more market share to PPG."
"Lou - SW Yahoo Finance after hours and pre market never makes sense. Now it’s down $5.19. It’s always some whacked out number. Also, watch how only our close everyday changes from 4pm to about 4:20?All my other stocks hold at 4pm close number."
"Even though shirleys been in a long time. I got in 1985. Chris conners was president of the west coast. Shw matched my shares. Went thru 3 splits before this one the other day. I only paid 0.23 a share and Shw matched my shares if I would leave Ppg. I’ve heard from soo many people to take some cream off the top. Never did I did add to the shares. 45,000 shares now. The dividends supplement my income for whatever I want. Great at Christmas time."

what is stopping this stock to go beyond 300$? great company
"This is on of my best stocks, nothing can keep this one down. As Clark Griswold says ""That's (it's) the gift that keeps on giving"""
"Lou, Shirley and other long term holders. In Your mult-decade holding of SHW, did you ever see this kind of scenario where raw materials weren't available with supply chain disruptions to SHW company? Is this something first time You folks are experiencing too?"
Wife is a manager at an NC Sherwin-Williams. Let me just say this Covid thing has done nothing but boosted business. People are sitting home all day with nothing but new time; is astounding how many people are using this time for something such as painting.
Keep up the good work SW employees! Thank you!
"Firstly, with most stocks I look at TA with scrutiny. Granted just because I bought Sherwin Williams at the forward stock split, and have no intention of selling, well I looked at the RSI & Williams %R indicators. With the fantastic price action to the upside, I worried…is SHW stock overbought? Yes, both indicators, in particular the William %R indicator it has been overbought since the beginning of July 2021 and remains overbought still. I guess soon the HFT software the hedge funds use will sell? Just a warning, I’m not selling, Heck No!!"
I hope that stock pop of + 7.36 is about Sika and not more fake yahoo finance news like the - 21.79 the other day.
I have no words. Wow.
Prayer for jack Breen who passed. He was ceo before Chris conners.
I’m retiring from S-W on Friday after 40 years and 4 stock splits - What a great company that is laser focused all those years and that won’t stop.
Has there been any talk of a split in near future?
So Charles Gross thinks SHW has a fair value of $324.00 His article does not discuss his thoughts on why then the stock is at $540.00 a share...
I bought SHW in March 2019 and did DCA'ing Total current Liabilities is 6.2 billion and Total current assests is 5.2 billion.Isn't that a bad metric to have on a balance sheet of a company?
"Hello, Lou et al, this is the other Richard- the one that is bullish on Shirley Williams. Very proud of the way that the management team has negotiated these awful waters in the midst of this quasi-recession. I think that SHW will return to 600+ by the next earnings- and just as Brando has alluded to below, the Stores/Consumer Division has been doing well during this shutdown, and have to think that with oil down, the price of raw materials is more favorable to the bottom line. I've been critical of SHW's management in the past, mostly because they've missed their earnings. They've been doing a darned good job maintaining the stock price through this. Got to think that dividend increase will continue."
This company has 20 billion in total assets and 19 billion in debt....a paint company??? What am I missing?
Did we really hit $659+ earlier?
Why is this company so high up in share value? Is this essentially a monopoly?

Wish I had money to buy this stock. Seems to me they got hit a bit harder than they should have. While I am not a fan of the box store Lowe's I was pleased to hear several months ago that SHW would be supplying a paint brand to them. ( think it was them and not HD). That should add to revenue in my opinion.
As economy opens up and real estate continues booming I see sherwin-williams making big gains next two years. They've had constant exponential growth for a decade. They solid buy and hold
"This stock is a rock, only one of my stocks that is in the green in today's bloodbath"
SHW has been on a 10 year run up and you’ve made money hand over fist. One pimple of a drop and you think the world is coming to an end. Stop crying.
Yes. All that striping coating comes from Shw. The old is 4”. The new is 6” quick dry coating. The other is thermo. It’s a powder. It’s melted and dropped. You can tell from the mill thickness. Then there’s the structures. Bridges. Overpasses. Underpasses etc. takes mostly zinc coatings and polyrenthanes. Shw is much better equipped to deliver thru local stores. Shw hit a new 52 week high today.
Is there any truth the company has picked up yet to announced a nice DOD contract ?
"what do You guys think about the earnings report that was released today? good, bad, expected?I know there are investors on this forum who have been holding this stock quite a long time like Lou, Robert etc. Please share your opinions.thankyou"
I have SW stock. Wondering when I should sell some? $550.??
it is time to get into SHW for steady cash flow ...
3 days down 5 days up. $709.34. Thurs. twerking. what happened to the three complainers. Manny moe jack. The world is coming to an end. Probably homeless. Bassam respectfully the splits don’t hurt or help us. Dividends this week or next.
Does anyone foresee another healthy dividend increase this year?
If you want to buy or add Shw the performance outlook is flat for the next 6 weeks. Then up to 9 months it’s going up. Yet I see the 1st qtr results to be outstanding. Shw up today $255.04 +$1.56. After hrs $255.29 +0.25.
"Inflation fears are all over the financial news lately. SHW is a stock thought to be a haven for the funds in an inflation prone economy; this might be why she's going to have a good year. Another thing, infrastructure investment means construction, construction means coatings, coatings means Shirley Williams..."
"I have been holding onto SHW over the last 2 years almost. before I bought I read their 10k statements and bought the stock. I am glad I did my research.I went to buy paint today to Home depot. I don't find Sherwin williams there. I see PPG, bearer (something like that) . I was really surprised that I can't find SHW paints at home depot. Is Shewin williams sold only in their stores and not at Home depot ?"
First quarter numbers are going to be huge. Forecast for rest of the year might be lighter.
450 by mid 2019
"All big company's will make decisions that are not advantageous to everyone - being a big corporation is tough and requires what seems at times heartless but it's not a social program; it's a corporation and it's responsibility is to the company and it's continuance. It's a tough market out there with global competition. I came to SW by way of acquisition. SW sat on us for a couple years before changes were made - so many grumbled and complained because nobody likes change, many left of their own accord and their harumph, harumph got them nowhere. I was given an opportunity to take another job and stay with SW and instead of whining about how awful everything was I grabbed my smile, wore it all the time, and took that job - and it changed my life. SW is still a great company - change isn't always comfortable."
Hi Shirley. I don’t think most people know who Chris Conners is. He was president of the west coast 1983. Then he became cco. This stock is dynamite. Next week dividend payout.
Even though Shw is current @ $304.91. -2.15. Shw hit a new 52 week high today @ $309.98.
"Kinda upset. My Sherwin Williams product specialist just told, using the term ""mainlining"", that they were going to stop producing alot of the products I use in high end residential products. Both my finish paint and my primers. I feel like Sherwin Williams is leaving the high end home market"
"I don't understand people who buy a stock because it beat earnings that analysts predicted? Do people realize that the company is guiding/telling these analysts what their earnings will be? So they are propping up their own results. They guide low and then give the real results.It would be good to note that this is a retail paint company at 35 times earnings. I wonder what PPG, Benjamin Moore trade at? Seems like a lay up short. Maybe long one of the other companies for relative value trade but I have not looked at them.35x earnings for a commodity low tech company doing nothing new under the sun. Low profit margin. What am I missing? Even the YAhoo index says it is overvalued lol."
"For those that missed it last week, here's another buying opportunity. SHW is the same financially strong, well-positioned and well-led company that is has been. Take advantage of the market driving its price down while you can. The economy always rebounds."
I worked for this company many years and left. What they specialize in is pitting people against each other. On many group conference calls if someone did something then you should do it too. What happens is everyone is trying to out do each other sending out meaningless emails all day and ultimately nothing gets accomplished. Just beat people up. My wife works for a large company (31 yrs. now) and would listen in on my conference calls and laugh. I remember her saying if they ran their company like SW the federal government would shut them down. I would be afraid to own their stock now especially at these levels.
Huge beat!!! trading $645 - $649 pre-market.
Thank you SHW!
why 3-1.... they say to make it more affordable for their workers and others... so why 3-1... should be 10-1 then the stock would be at ~$70/shr..... I just don't see the 3-1 working for the reason they quoted...
"Have my fellow “longs” noticed how nicely SHW’s price is staying above the simple moving average lengths of the 20, 50 and 200? [Bullish]…"
usually does SHW drop or go up before earnings? I want to add more but trying to understand when to add
bought more
"I just tried to buy exterior paint at my local SHW store and was told they are OUT! I was told it’s nationwide due to supply chain disruptions and lack of key raw materials. The store was EMPTY! Based on this and the crazy rich PE, I bought OTM puts for December. You have been warned. Sell Sell Sell!!!!!!!"
oops what happened? why down below 300$?
Up for no reason whatsoever.
sorry. new to SHW. I see in 2017 the stock doubled. but why is it not doing well in 2018 and 2019? in my research fi found ace hardware removed SHW and started using a different pain company. is that why? or some ohter fundamental reason for not have so much growth stock wise? I am reading more to invest in this stock.
"Everyone is using the WAG method on predicting S-W stock. They announced a Earnings warning 2 weeks ago that missed Wallstreets extremely high projections. Stock fell $30 before market opened, closed down $16 and within 3 days was back ahead. S-W still post a record year in sales, gallons and profit for 2018. PPG announced horrible earnings but were not as horrible as Wallsreet thought. They got a pat on the back? What company would you invest in - moving ahead or falling behind to flat? It will probably drop tomorrow on official earnings and bounce back again. One needs to know what Valspar actually brings to the table with packaging and coil coatings and are the industry leader with them. Look it up. This stock is priced right at 400 until a earnings report that beats Wallsteets expectations which will be 2019 1st Qtr.Going against a soft 2018."
"Can someone RESPONSIBLY post why Sewell left Sherwin? The company he went to (WestRock) looks like a great opportunity for him, so he was going TO something rather than running FROM something. On the other hand, wasn't Sewell the ""heir-apparent"" at Sherwin? RESPONSIBLE replies only, please."
Resilience is the word for this stock!.......
Why on earth is this stock down after what I read is a good earnings report?
"@Andrew. We are still waiting on your 20/25 better stocks than SHW....Also, your quote. ""Hey Rob I'm not your broker. Trust me next stop 600 and then probably to 500 or so. You can take that to the bank and cash it.""Well look again...$Buy, Hold, Reinvest! SHW is a steam roller.The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)718.29+12.04 (+1.70%)As of 2:11PM EDT. Market open."
I will be back on the next quarter when it goes down by 25%
Funny how they did this the second week of September. The full year is the same????
Anyone have an idea on today’s drop after S-W just increased guidance for sales and income for Q2 and full year 2021??? Pre market was up $5.99? Plus a price increase to cover raw material costs?
For all those ?'s about SHW dropping after a great q4 earnings report...its across the board. Don't over- react.Yesterday...PepsiCo (PEP) Drops to 3-Month Low Despite Strong Quarter while announcing a 5% dividend increase.SHW is in good shape and will continue to grow especially as spring/summer approaching for the vast majority of outdoor projects. Look for $740 before the split.724.70+5.41 (+0.75%)As of 11:53AM EST 02/12/2021. Market open.Buy $$$
Is Sherwin used only in painting houses and commerical buildings or used in automobiles/aircrafts/bridges etc
Whole painting industry shorting into earning lol Few..
I bought spce at $25.25. It’s $55.91 now. I have not sold a penny of my sherwinlou stock. There bullish.
Where are the complainers non believers at. Shw $733.40. +13.16. Gearing up for the split. Last dividend was the best. 15k shares. 
"I've been trying to understand why this stock has been taking such a beating this week, and everything points to the TikTok star/fomer SW employee who was fired in Columbus for mixing paint on social media. Can this really be why the stock has been tanking? Part of me hopes so, because it means the effects are short term and we should hopefully see the stock price take off again soon."
I 1st bought SHW at $29.00 it had its last split at around $70.00. It has never let me down. I've been in and out for over 20 years. Its been my mainstay. Never sweat this one.
"Drops like this usually don't end in 1 day. By middle of next week it should find a better entry point. Long term, still a nice holding. Let it settle."
Shw at 463.39 on July 2nd. Waiting for 2nd quarter results. Should be good from the synergies from Valspar and Lowe’s. But Shw is on trac to end the year at 489.15.
Question to long term holders of SHW like Lou. Do you folks think SHW will ever split?
"Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving It?Zacks Equity ResearchZacksJanuary 22, 2020, 5:35 AM PSTShares of The Sherwin-Williams Company SHW scaled a fresh 52-week high of $598.25 on Jan 21, before closing the session at $593.06.The company has a market cap of around $54.7 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the past three months was around 480.9K. The company has an expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 11.9%.The stock has surged 50.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 48.9% rally.What’s Driving Sherwin-Williams?Upbeat view, strong demand in domestic market and synergies of Valspar acquisition are major factors driving the company.In October 2019, Sherwin-Williams stated that it expects low single digit percentage increase in net sales for 2019 on a year-over-year basis. The company expects EPS in the range of $17.07-$17.47 for 2019 compared with $11.67 in 2018. It also raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 to the range of $20.90-$21.30.Sherwin-Williams is seeing strong demand in its domestic end-use markets and remains committed to retail operation expansion. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets.The company is also benefiting from consistent strength in architectural paint markets in North America. Its third-quarter sales were driven by increased paint sales volume in North American stores and higher selling prices, which more than offset weak demand across certain end-markets outside the United States.Moreover, the company is gaining from synergies of the Valspar acquisition. The company expects to end 2019 at annual run rate synergies of around $415 million.The company’s cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are also supporting its margins.SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENTAd The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and ConsensusThe Sherwin-Williams Company Price and ConsensusThe Sherwin-Williams Company price-consensus-chart | The Sherwin-Williams Company Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksSherwin-Williams currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."
"On the way to $310 by 10/31 BUY, HOLD, DRIP~!307.50+1.59 (+0.52%)As of 2:37PM EDT. Market open."
$303 to be exact. Where ar though manny moe n jack.
"I have problem with this stock. it keeps going up almost every day. It would be nice if it goes up in 45 degree angle. no. it's going up too steep. I hope it doesn't drop as fast as it is going up. bought in March 2019. I am a happy camper. ROI of this stock compared to it's peers is very good. if this is the way it goes up, it will hit 325 by end of the year"
We have a few troublemakers in this group. I call manny moe and jack. Now another jack axx.Just a reminder Shw on 4/1 split @ $246.00. Today 4/30 $273.87 +$0.43. Dow’s down today -185.51. Shw beat 1st qtr earnings. Shw increased dividends 23.1% this year. I’m Optimistic that Sherwin-Williams w end the year at appr $300-350. Too early in the year to narrow it down at this point.
"the extra 2 shares means nothing other than the same stock/same financials... divided by 3, to reduce stock price for broader group to buy in... the run is simply people buying a good solid company;for those that who believe this stock split is something other, then you should probably stay away from the market."
Spot on Richard - That’s why Chris Conner always wanted a high stock price that attracted long term investors. My guess is when S-W announced the 4th Qtr earnings and strong 2021 forecast and the stock did nothing it was time to split. S-W always soars on positive earnings. Keeping it in the mid 200s fends off day traders but opens doors to more desired investors that think 700s is too high or can’t afford it. It’s been probably 25 years since last split under Jack Breen.
I've been following SHW for years. This is the first time that I can remember that the share price took a beating when Shirley BEAT her earnings. Anybody have any ideas about what happened today?
"And Shw keeps going up. $277.91. +$4.04. After hrs another $278.80. +$0.89. Where are manny moe and jack axx at. The non stock holders. The world is coming to an end. Boo hoo. Shw cover the earth, Actually I said end of the year prox $300-350. And I also w be retired from state service. State pension Sherwin Williams pension.45,000 share of Sherwin Williams and others."
