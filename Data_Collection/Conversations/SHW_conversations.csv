"I’m baffled on what’s an earnings beat. I Love SW and not picking on them. But when Zacks list your EPS last year at 2.76, you report 2.09 and the estimate is 2.07, that’s a 25% loss. Your sales were dead flat with a estimate of dead flat??? It seems with every guidance cut Wallstreet lowers the bar to jump or crawl over for companies to beat. Those are the worst results I’ve seen for SW maybe ever. Could you imagine if Apple sales were flat with a negative 25% EPS over last year what would happen.I’m sure SW would rather have a positive EPS right now and miss a earnings beat. Maybe I’m missing the picture."
"Yefri, This is a great stock, in two weeks, I’m up, just shy of $19 a share. You, must have a short position? and you’re on the wrong side of the trade. SHW will go ."
I wish it splits. so I can more. sometimes it is hard to afford to buy even a single stock. I have SHW 9 PERCENT of my portfolio
Hello bassam Richard Shirley. I’m expecting after the split it may go down alittle. Very little. We’re dancing again this morning. $745.84. No complainers who never had any shares. The short sellers.
Great job. Waiting until the end of September to alert that the year was going to be soft. Down _$18 per share today!!!!!
You folks understand sherwinlou split @$246 April 1st. Current @ $272.78. Plus a nice dividend increase of 23.1%.
Keep up the good work SW employees! Thank you!
"the extra 2 shares means nothing other than the same stock/same financials... divided by 3, to reduce stock price for broader group to buy in... the run is simply people buying a good solid company;for those that who believe this stock split is something other, then you should probably stay away from the market."
The freeze in Texas and a shortage of titanium that's used in most paints is the biggest issue..let's hope it can be resolved..also a strong demand for paint and the manufacturing can't keep up
Whenever S-W dips 5% or more it’s a buy. This stock fell to 330s in March when market crashed and 723 today. What else can you say? Yesterday is a mystery as I’ve owned this stock for over 35 years had 3 splits and started buying at $11. I’m very happy with S-W as it always beats the odds.
Shw at 463.39 on July 2nd. Waiting for 2nd quarter results. Should be good from the synergies from Valspar and Lowe’s. But Shw is on trac to end the year at 489.15.
As economy opens up and real estate continues booming I see sherwin-williams making big gains next two years. They've had constant exponential growth for a decade. They solid buy and hold
"Morgan Stanley interviewed the CEO of SHW; based on a discussion of the business model and trends, Morgan Stanley increased the price target estimate of SHW to 345 from 315. Based on the share appreciation that we've seen since the split, that sounds feasible..."
How I feel about Sherwin Williams!
"Well, folks, it's almost earnings day. Nice to see a little run up, how about it!"
"Shirley had a great year in 2019. Lou, I think that there is a lot of optimism regarding the economy which translates into residential building which means that they'll buy a lot of paint- 2020 will be a good year. Even though the P/E is very high, there is still upside momentum on share price. Wish they'd increase the dividends- a little stingy there."
"All these people panic-selling for no reason. 3rd qtr guidance reduced with SHW saying sales are flat to “down slightly”. FY guidance says sales will be growth in the “high single digit percentage”. This says that A. demand still exists which will continue to drive future growth and B. they are still making money. If you can afford to hold, hold. If you can afford to buy, BUY."
Shirley…. I’m thinking about selling my Shw because it’s w Corp Shw. Then rebuying and put into my reg brokerage acct. w Corp Shw you can’t sell a few shares. It’s all or none. What do you think. The positives. Negatives.

"Allen J. Mistysyn -- Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial OfficerAnd here's the -- as you know, as the year goes on, if we see raw material costs increasing more than what we have planned or what we have in our guidance. You know us, we have discipline, and we'll go out with another price increase. You saw that kind of 2011, 2012, when we had to go out with five price increases in the 18-month period, that discipline is still there. And if we're not covering our costs, we'll have to go out again. But right now, we feel comfortable with the price increases that are going into the market.Industrial customers love multiple price increases each year. Should be a winning strategy to lose more market share to PPG."

Did I miss big news or a press release somewhere? What in the world is driving today's surge? I don't remember the last time I saw their stock increase this much in one day.
Hello basam. 2017 was an excellent year. Sales abroad are way down. Lowe’s is selling all Shw products. Ace is selling Shw Valspar. Shw is still about 4% higher than the other chemical companies. Shw dividends are ok. I have about 14k shares from 1985. I just bought another 70 shares the other day. If you buy shares of Shw before aug 23 then you’ll get those dividends on sept 6th. Also Shw and the other 2 big boys agreed to pay calif 305m / 3 over 6 years on lead abatement. Calif can’t ever go against the three ever again. Once Shw went down 10.69 I bought 70 more shares. Shw owns dutchboy. Martin senor. Pratt Lambert. Valspar. Minwax. Auto paints brands. Mexico branded paints. Purdue brushes the painters choice. Kylon spray. So many brands.
"Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving It?Zacks Equity ResearchZacksJanuary 22, 2020, 5:35 AM PSTShares of The Sherwin-Williams Company SHW scaled a fresh 52-week high of $598.25 on Jan 21, before closing the session at $593.06.The company has a market cap of around $54.7 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the past three months was around 480.9K. The company has an expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 11.9%.The stock has surged 50.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 48.9% rally.What’s Driving Sherwin-Williams?Upbeat view, strong demand in domestic market and synergies of Valspar acquisition are major factors driving the company.In October 2019, Sherwin-Williams stated that it expects low single digit percentage increase in net sales for 2019 on a year-over-year basis. The company expects EPS in the range of $17.07-$17.47 for 2019 compared with $11.67 in 2018. It also raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 to the range of $20.90-$21.30.Sherwin-Williams is seeing strong demand in its domestic end-use markets and remains committed to retail operation expansion. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets.The company is also benefiting from consistent strength in architectural paint markets in North America. Its third-quarter sales were driven by increased paint sales volume in North American stores and higher selling prices, which more than offset weak demand across certain end-markets outside the United States.Moreover, the company is gaining from synergies of the Valspar acquisition. The company expects to end 2019 at annual run rate synergies of around $415 million.The company’s cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are also supporting its margins.SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENTAd The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and ConsensusThe Sherwin-Williams Company Price and ConsensusThe Sherwin-Williams Company price-consensus-chart | The Sherwin-Williams Company Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksSherwin-Williams currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."
"This stock has been phenomenal the last 15 years, but I don’t know what it has left in the tank. Not a growth stock and not a high yield dividend stock either, so what is it? Maybe the share repurchasing and paying down Valspar debt might be able to right the ship. The split told me there is limited price movement going forward. I hope I’m wrong because I do love this stock and not ready to bail just yet"
PPG news having an affect on SHW. I wonder if Sherwin will have same troubles?
"Want to own more shares of SHW, but I think the returns from here on are likely going to be subpar if I buy at these levels."
"Rob, Lou, Mike, Shirley , why is SHW going up when earnings are not good. I am long but I am trying to understand"
DONT MESS WITH THIS BULL>>>292.41+7.11 (+2.49%)As of 2:54PM EDT. Market open.
shw clearly said that due to supply chain issues the earnings will not be good but why is the stock going up in spite of earnings will not be good
"My bet is on Shirley having a bang up year in 2021. Share appreciation for two years running (Nov to Nov) has been on the order of 30%. The market likes stability. If Biden takes the presidency, and we have a check on the Democrats with a majority in the Senate that is a scenario favorable to Wall Street. We'll have a vaccine sometime late next year, and in the intermediate time frame we'll see the effects of a stimulus deal- which should be favorable to the markets. Hopefully Trump's economy has a little traction. This all bodes well for SHW which depends on building and consumer spending largely for profits. Wouldn't be surprised if we see share prices in the mid 800's (or higher) this time next year."
SHW has been on a literal 10 year run up. It was due for a correction as trees don’t grow to the sky! It’s no surprise Lou is as quiet as a church mouse as no one brags forever.
"Can someone RESPONSIBLY post why Sewell left Sherwin? The company he went to (WestRock) looks like a great opportunity for him, so he was going TO something rather than running FROM something. On the other hand, wasn't Sewell the ""heir-apparent"" at Sherwin? RESPONSIBLE replies only, please."
With the Dow down 22 points Shw is only down -2.36. So we’re good.
"@wbsawk- $280/sharealways possible, but the run up tells me that the big money, which drives this train, knows better."
"And Shw keeps going up. $277.91. +$4.04. After hrs another $278.80. +$0.89. Where are manny moe and jack axx at. The non stock holders. The world is coming to an end. Boo hoo. Shw cover the earth, Actually I said end of the year prox $300-350. And I also w be retired from state service. State pension Sherwin Williams pension.45,000 share of Sherwin Williams and others."
What is the date you have to own the stock by to get the three for one split?
Good NEWS!Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Raises Quarterly Dividend 23.1% to $1.65
I’m retiring from S-W on Friday after 40 years and 4 stock splits - What a great company that is laser focused all those years and that won’t stop.
I was wondering why S-W down so much with only good news as Morgan Stanley raised target and sees 12% increase. Plus S-W already gave their guidance for rest of year. PPG doesn’t run a tight ship like S-W and investors shouldn’t lump same type companies together and wait for S-W to change their guidance rather than speculate before panic mode.
"I did a remodel last year and asked my contractor which paint he preferred and he said he doesn't use anything but Sherman Williams and neither do his friends. I asked why and he said that's what you use if you don't want any complaints. I thought that was an interesting response, so I checked the stock price and it was $712 a share. Wow... couldn't believe that! Ended up picking some shares on a whim and very happy so far after the spilt. That's all I got..."
"This is on of my best stocks, nothing can keep this one down. As Clark Griswold says ""That's (it's) the gift that keeps on giving"""

"One more thing. To add to my comment from yesterday, and this is important for the folks like Basam and Rajan who are looking to get in. These hedge funds that are buying SHW shares have very sophisticated research tools and do deep dives into a company. Regular people don't have these kinds of tools to analyze stocks. But what we CAN do is follow what they're doing- the only danger is we get caught real bad when they sell, which when they do, they do big. The good thing about Shirley, is she's a great long rider- great business model, committed to a core industry, well managed. So my advice is to buy and hold. My bet is that they're going to have a great 3rd quarter earnings result- we may see 800/share sooner than we thought."

How many people really think the price increase is due supply chain?I suspect it is 80% BS. You raise prices when you can because the market will bear it. Whether your costs go up not really does have a big influence
"it's paint, at a 37 P/E ratio. competition will eat it's juiced-up stock valuation flesh soon. not gonna be pretty for the long haul."
Did this stock have a split a while ago ????
$303 to be exact. Where ar though manny moe n jack.
"For those that missed it last week, here's another buying opportunity. SHW is the same financially strong, well-positioned and well-led company that is has been. Take advantage of the market driving its price down while you can. The economy always rebounds."
"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Sherwin-Williams (SHW). Shares have added about 6.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sherwin-Williams due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts."
"Below are comments that CEO John Morikis made on the earnings call. THIS is why SHW is doing so well despite the industry headwinds. Demand is strong and production capabilities are strong. The factors weighing them down are raw material constraints and inflation. RM constraints are temporary but they are working towards working around them in the meantime and inflation, despite being another challenge, is something the company has faced before and managed to profit during anyway.John G. Morikis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer""Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call. First, the demand environment remains robust across our pro architectural and industrial end markets. Many external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive. Demand is not the issue. Second, we are ready to meet this demand. We continue to invest in growth initiatives. We have significant production capacity available today and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters. Our capabilities are not the issue. The issues that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continued to be industrywide raw material availability constraints and inflation. Let me be very clear on how we are responding. Nobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams. We're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on the job better than our competitors. We will continue to focus on customer solutions. We are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses."""
I have no words. Wow.
gee down 2% merely (52 week high at 310)...i call this a wall street darling stock.
"Lou, Bassam- Shirley did well with a beat today. EPS of 6.57...(estimate was 6.35); good on them! I've been critical of the SHW management when EPS did not expectations, but this is a very good thing (Lou, do you think they were listening? LOL). I think the Valspar acquisition is starting to get some traction, and stores continue to do well."
"CLEVELAND, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) today announced it has signed an agreement to acquire the European industrial coatings business of Sika AG. The transaction is expected to close in the beginning of 2022. Based in Germany with additional sales and technical support in Poland, Austria and Switzerland, Sika's European industrial coating business engineers, manufactures and sells corrosion protection coating systems for high value interior and exterior steel infrastructure, bridges, airport and rail, wind and energy, chemicals, power transmission and stations, interior linings for oil and gas tanks, vessels, and pipework, and water and wastewater applications, along with fire protection coating systems to protect and preserve steel, wood and concrete building components. Sales of the business were approximately CHF 75 million ($82 million) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquired business will become part of the Company's Performance Coatings Group operating segment. Approximately 130 Sika employees are expected to join Sherwin-Williams.""This transaction fits our strategy of acquiring complementary, high-quality, differentiated businesses that add to our profitable growth momentum,"" said Sherwin-Williams Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John G. Morikis. ""The business brings us scale, unique technology, a strong sales and marketing team, technical service capabilities, strategically located manufacturing, and leading specification and approval positions, all of which we can leverage further throughout Europe and other regions across the world. Additionally, synergy opportunities give us great confidence in accelerating the already strong financial performance of the business. We look forward to officially welcoming Sika's industrial coating employees to Sherwin-Williams upon the close of the transaction at the beginning of next year."""
Sorry haven’t been in conversations. I did not sell any of my shares. Quite a few thousand shares when I was working for them in the 80s. Paid like 0.23. Split 3x. Then last year I bought more at 458. It hit 603 something today. Closed at 594 something. Dividend check next week. Did you notice Shw and HDepot follows the same graph pattern.
Does anyone know why S-W is down $21.79 and 7% after hours as of 6:38pm ??? This stock has only moved as much as 7% on a very rare occasion. Or is this just another weird after hours / pre market price on yahoo finance this stock seems to always show?
"I have been holding onto SHW over the last 2 years almost. before I bought I read their 10k statements and bought the stock. I am glad I did my research.I went to buy paint today to Home depot. I don't find Sherwin williams there. I see PPG, bearer (something like that) . I was really surprised that I can't find SHW paints at home depot. Is Shewin williams sold only in their stores and not at Home depot ?"
"Lou, Basam, Mike et al, not sure what the hell happened yesterday...One guess that I have is that Shirley reached a sell price point for a hedge fund, and they liquidated all their SHW assets to move into more depressed stocks that were held down by COVID. When it was announced that the vaccine had been developed, and the market was recovering like crazy (which we knew that it would), they moved out.Still, the fundamentals for Shirley are really good- with the caveat that the P/E is very high, but so are many good quality stocks. Not sure what a reasonable P/E is anymore.Anybody else have any ideas about what went down yesterday?"
Hi Shirley. I don’t think most people know who Chris Conners is. He was president of the west coast 1983. Then he became cco. This stock is dynamite. Next week dividend payout.
"Everyone is using the WAG method on predicting S-W stock. They announced a Earnings warning 2 weeks ago that missed Wallstreets extremely high projections. Stock fell $30 before market opened, closed down $16 and within 3 days was back ahead. S-W still post a record year in sales, gallons and profit for 2018. PPG announced horrible earnings but were not as horrible as Wallsreet thought. They got a pat on the back? What company would you invest in - moving ahead or falling behind to flat? It will probably drop tomorrow on official earnings and bounce back again. One needs to know what Valspar actually brings to the table with packaging and coil coatings and are the industry leader with them. Look it up. This stock is priced right at 400 until a earnings report that beats Wallsteets expectations which will be 2019 1st Qtr.Going against a soft 2018."
How’s the competitive moat here? Worried about private-label products from the likes of HD and LOW? Will this company’s market position be just as strong in 20 years???
Seattle store has no paint. NO SALES! Store closings are next...
"Vanguard, blackrock, JP Morgan chase and 8 other institutions have doubled their positions in 2Q 2021. I wonder if they know something that we don’t."
"long term investors Lou, Rob , what is your opinion about the guidance SHW gave today?"
"This has got to be one of the safest stocks to own. Been around for 150+ years (not many companies can say that) and the largest paint and coatings company in the world. Sure there is some competition in PPG, Benjamin Moore, RPM and Behr, but society will ALWAYS need paints and coatings. I don't think we have to worry about paints and coatings being replaced by some other technology."
First quarter numbers are going to be huge. Forecast for rest of the year might be lighter.
I am long on SHW from March 2019. It has 10 billion debt. Isn't that too much when interest rates go up? can you folks share your opinion?
Yes I'm also not happy about the last three quarters... but shw had a big big expense on lowes. getting shw into lowes. lots of product. literature. mixers. tinters. etc. I know chris conners personally and Morikis. both good guys. if you have some ideas instead of just critizing post them. new construction is up. lowes is online now. Valspar is online also. Richard do you own any stock or are you just unemployed and want to critize. I expect Shw to end the year around 480.xx
Shw split at $246.00. Estimate end of the year at $291.28 plus dividends. That’s real good we’re talking 9 months. Shw is also BULLISH. So Manny Moe and Jack since you don’t have any shares anyway and the short sellers just get out. Seems. Shirley Richard Bassam myself and soo many others have the Karma and profits in our pockets.
PPG is also down 3.82% after hours?
Does Sherman sell any paint inside of China ?
"This is the point I try to make but many people don't understand. Market volatility, and even when the market plummets, is when you can make the most money. Excerpt from an interview with Kevin O'Leary that drives that point home:“Volatility, I don’t love it,” O’Leary told Yahoo Finance Live, “but when it does happen, it lets me re-adjust. I don’t sell my stocks when there’s volatility, I try to find opportunity in it.”"
"I have problem with this stock. it keeps going up almost every day. It would be nice if it goes up in 45 degree angle. no. it's going up too steep. I hope it doesn't drop as fast as it is going up. bought in March 2019. I am a happy camper. ROI of this stock compared to it's peers is very good. if this is the way it goes up, it will hit 325 by end of the year"
Hi Richard. Shw Target end of the years is $792.05. There a very conservative company.
I don't hear anything from Richard or Eddy late. SHW at 443.15 today to finish the year at 488-495.
"Long term investors like Lou or Richard. Question for you good folks.I am looking at the balance sheet of SHW. Total revenues for 2019 is 18 billion roughly. But cash and equivalents in only 161 million. How come it is so low?They usually say, one should invest in companies with strong balance sheet with lots of cash. I am just trying to pick your brains guys since You have been long term holders. was this small amount of cash was any time an issue for SHW?Even though the total shares on float is only 90 million the EPS is only 16$. I did read that SHW bought valsper all cash for 13 billion. could that be the reason they don't have much cash on the books?I am trying to understand the numbers before I put more into SHW. I am comparing it other industrials (not same sector) like Roper technologies (ROP). Cash on hand is in billions. Even though the float is around 500 million (way more than SHW) the EPS is 17$ in 2019. thank you"
"I've been trying to understand why this stock has been taking such a beating this week, and everything points to the TikTok star/fomer SW employee who was fired in Columbus for mixing paint on social media. Can this really be why the stock has been tanking? Part of me hopes so, because it means the effects are short term and we should hopefully see the stock price take off again soon."
3 days ago Richard said sell now it was going to $360...how's $450 sit with ya Rich?
I understand SHW is a solid company with good Mgmt but $620...wow! What is driving such a premium?
"On the way to $310 by 10/31 BUY, HOLD, DRIP~!307.50+1.59 (+0.52%)As of 2:37PM EDT. Market open."

"I don't much care for Jim Cramer, but he had great advice this morning. When stock futures are down, and many stocks are down even more than that before the bell, and there are clearly more sellers than buyers, that is the time to buy."
I wonder how much down SHW can go.
"@ANDREW, Seriously!? Keep shorting this & good luck.""Hey Rob I'm not your broker. Trust me next stop 600 and then probably to 500 or so. You can take that to the bank and cash it.""

"what do You guys think about the earnings report that was released today? good, bad, expected?I know there are investors on this forum who have been holding this stock quite a long time like Lou, Robert etc. Please share your opinions.thankyou"
Where are the complainers non believers at. Shw $733.40. +13.16. Gearing up for the split. Last dividend was the best. 15k shares. 
"SHW has once again surprised everyone by beating consensus EPS. I've been saying it all along...this a well managed company focused heavily on cost savings. Supply chains are an external factor weighing heavily on every industry right now, but they are temporary and the fundamentals haven't changed. I get a lot of blowback when I say these things, but SHW is a good company and the share price speaks for itself."
"This was last month. Lou VassalloLou Vassallolast monthThe Sherwin-Williams Company SHW logged earnings (as reported) of $4.46 per share in fourth-quarter 2020, up 67.7% from $2.66 in the year-ago quarter.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter were $5.09 per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.85.Sherwin-Williams posted revenues of $4,488.8 million, up 9.1% year over year.

"Shirley recently gets stalled at the 734-735 price point, share price seems to settle at that level, but not hold above that point- my bet is profit taking and a high P/E. Don't think that it will stay there, especially after the next earnings in Jan, once earnings is demonstrably higher. Patience is a virtue LOL!"
"I don't understand people who buy a stock because it beat earnings that analysts predicted? Do people realize that the company is guiding/telling these analysts what their earnings will be? So they are propping up their own results. They guide low and then give the real results.It would be good to note that this is a retail paint company at 35 times earnings. I wonder what PPG, Benjamin Moore trade at? Seems like a lay up short. Maybe long one of the other companies for relative value trade but I have not looked at them.35x earnings for a commodity low tech company doing nothing new under the sun. Low profit margin. What am I missing? Even the YAhoo index says it is overvalued lol."
Well so much for my comments yesterday #$%$W follows PPG lead and lowers their guidance. Down another - $6.84 pre market. Yikes!
No brainer.Added to my position (stock sold off) as they gave us a preview of the numbers going into earning on the 27th showing strength and increased sales and better then expected EPS.
Anyone notice at 4:07 after hours S-W was up $39.65 to $799.50???????
Basam - Stock has gone up cause I sold at $301 Lol. Zacks has SW with a .3 % sales loss and they missed profit last Qtr with much higher sales. Maybe SW buying back shares to keep rally going leading up to earnings? Now I’ll have to wait to buy back in after earnings report. Oh well - at least my Tesla was up $115 per share today!
"The best thing that could happen to this company, it’s stock prices and investors at these new found levels is a stock split. 3:1 split at least. You could even do APPLE numbers and go 7:1. Make this more available to the everyday investor. The brand speaks for itself and has proved it can weather any storm and outperform the S&P... Now, lets get some SERIOUS money pouring in."
"I read that Coca-Cola, since container ships are so backed up and expensive, is reverting to shipping raw materials on coal ships. It results in new logistical challenges, but it keeps product moving. I wonder if SHW (and other companies) will go this route and what business impact it could have."
"Is Sherwin-Williams's (NYSE:SHW) 111% Share Price Increase Well Justified?The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) which saw its share price drive 111% higher over five years. It's down 2.4% in the last seven days. While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Sherwin-Williams, it has a TSR of 122% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Sherwin-Williams shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 17% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper."
Anyone have an idea on today’s drop after S-W just increased guidance for sales and income for Q2 and full year 2021??? Pre market was up $5.99? Plus a price increase to cover raw material costs?
Noah - I agree  % !!!Whoever knocks this company about its stock has not done their homework back to 1981 when then CEO Jack Breen started an incredible stock run that is still going. “Cover The Earth” !
Feels good to be over $300! Let's keep going!
I’m sticking with it. I think it was the short sellers.
For all those ?'s about SHW dropping after a great q4 earnings report...its across the board. Don't over- react.Yesterday...PepsiCo (PEP) Drops to 3-Month Low Despite Strong Quarter while announcing a 5% dividend increase.SHW is in good shape and will continue to grow especially as spring/summer approaching for the vast majority of outdoor projects.

Went up after hrs another 4.80. Now removed. Excellent day. 
Both labor and inventory issues are causing Shirley stock decline.
LouI looked at the stock price historical graph from 1986. SHW runs (this is normal for every stock) upwards for few years and I don't know the right word to say but either it consolidate/runs sideways for few years.From 1997 april to 2003 March it went sideways. stock didnt go anywhere. Again from 2007 July to DEc 2009 sideways.Now it is again in uptrend. May be that is how SHW works. So I think I should wait and buy more in dips during sideways mode. any opinions are greatly appreciated.thank you
Anything over 300 I’m a happy camper. On a down day Fri we’re at 305.50. 
"I see a lot of people on here talking about selling their stocks since the market is stumbling lately, so I am interested in some of your opinions. Personally, as long as I'm happy with a particular organizations management, I don't see because of trouble with the overall economy. If the market tanks but a company is strong, theoretically I should come out on top when the economy rebounds. Does anyone else feel this way or is it more popular to sell when the economy as a whole begins to struggle? Just interested in different philosophies... not trying to change mine or anyone else's opinion."
SHW has been on a 10 year run up and you’ve made money hand over fist. One pimple of a drop and you think the world is coming to an end. Stop crying.
The SHW Bull kicking the Support gate and Mr. Market aside.
Shw was bullish.. then neutral. Now bearish.
3-1 stock split just announced.
"So I am an analyst and this is a stock I really don't understand. It's 37x earnings off of what has to be the best history for the housing market possible, pays no dividend, has a marginal net profit margin in a cyclical industry. Can you write gap down any bigger. Rates rise a little and this sucker is toast.Oil prices rising increase input costs and transportation. Housing market seems to be wobbling for the first time in years.Earnings being cut in half and a realistic p/e of 15 on this pig put it 1/4 the current price.The only thing is has going for it is that they have created an Oligopoly. How the government allows this is beyond me. They sell paint for $50 plus a gallon. When do people say enough on ridiculous prices?Sell this pig while you can."
We have a few troublemakers in this group. I call manny moe and jack. Now another jack axx.Just a reminder Shw on 4/1 split @ $246.00. Today 4/30 $273.87 +$0.43. Dow’s down today -185.51. Shw beat 1st qtr earnings. Shw increased dividends 23.1% this year. I’m Optimistic that Sherwin-Williams w end the year at appr $300-350. Too early in the year to narrow it down at this point.
I bought like 14 gallons of paint and some supplies all from Sherwin Williams in the last 5 weeks. I own a few shares of this company and like to think of it as paying myself to paint. I've been in since before the split and am quite happy with performance thus far.
"I said $310 by Halloween back in June...a week early I guess. $SHW is a rocketship. Buy, Hold, Drip"
"Sherwin-WilliamsWatching paint dry is famously boring. Owning shares of the leading paint retailer isn't.Sherwin-Williams has been a fantastically profitable business for shareholders in recent years. The stock jumped nearly 900% since mid-2011, in fact. Add dividend payments to that mix and you have a nearly 1,000% return in 10 years compared to 300% for the S&P 500. Sherwin-Williams checks all the important investing boxes. It maintains dominant market share in an attractive, growing industry. It has a proven ability to raise prices at a higher rate than inflation, and a proven ability to boost dividends through any kind of market.Its management team has shown a knack for effective capital allocation, too, whether it's through stock repurchases, debt financing, or large acquisitions like the Valspar merger. That strategic asset should help keep returns rising even after the current boom times end.But there's no sign of that slowdown yet. Sales jumped 12% in the most recent quarter. Executives are predicting even faster gains when Sherwin-Williams reports Q2 earnings in late July."
"Andrew...RESPONSIBLE replies only please. Define ""miserable"" environment. Sewell is in the executive suite. It's an entirely different world there. WestRock has a choppy stock chart, significant debt and is in an industry that's quite challenging (paperboard and related products). Sherwin basically has a monopoly in paint and some coatings categories, so I'm questioning why he left. So if anyone out there, especially someone with accurate insights, would care to comment, it would be appreciated."
"Big mistake to sell into dips- just a word to newer SHW investors...good company, very resilient. And as Pete notes below, Barrons just raised end of year share price guidance to $320. Been a share holder for many, many years, this is not something to panic over. This is a buy and hold stock, and a stock to BUY on the dips. It'll be back, economy has a lot of steam left."
Hello all. Hi Richard. Shirley. Bassam. Andrew your talking nonsense. So we got manny moe and jack back. Shortens prob don’t own any shares.People leave all the time. Name. Position. Monies. I look at the 3/1 split as neither good or bad. But more intelligent investors w get into Shw. Pumping the price.I orig paid 0.23. 1985. $465 2019. Where are we now $676. The 23.1% dividend is good. Nobody has the paint line or the distribution like Shw. This month w the stock splits I’m hoping around $675-680. Then the split $225-230. End of the year $300 would make me happy. Most stocks today are making there earnings and then going down. Look at Costco. Walmart. And soo many others. Down after earnings.
"@BEV Fan- Agree that it is a good long term hold. Far too soon to consign the stock price, however, to the 600's- maybe it will hit high 600's, but not going to stay there. Company buy backs will likely help in that regard, also we need to see the effect of the split. It'll hit 800 before the end of 2021, up to you if you want to stay for the ride- maybe you're a short seller? Great company with a great product; going to to fine."
"As a new homeowner, I have been doing alot of painting. I finally got to see that Sherwin Williams paint is superior. I am mostly using HGTV Home Showcase paint by Sherwin Williams (Lowe's) for both the ceiling and walls. Great first coat coverage, dries fast and no paint coming off the wall when 3m painters tape removed. Now compare this with Glidden Paint by PPG (Home Depot). First coating not as great, takes longer to dry and a couple of areas the paint came off during tape removal.Sure, you are looking at $19 a gallon (PPG) vs. $35 a gallon (SHW), but it's well worth it.Proud to be SHW share owner."
If you want to buy or add Shw the performance outlook is flat for the next 6 weeks. Then up to 9 months it’s going up. Yet I see the 1st qtr results to be outstanding. Shw up today $255.04 +$1.56. After hrs $255.29 +0.25.
Did you see the 1st year outlook is $328.35. It was $311.
"The best paint, the stores are super easy and save so much time. I’m in and out ASAP, whenever I need paint I go to the local Sherwin Williams instead of Home Depot or Lowe’s."
"Bezos can take New Shepard to space, but Morikis is taking Sherwin-Williams to the moon."
Sherwin Williams has outstanding financial statements and that's what we should pay more attention to. Hurricane Ida is not going to last forever and will not affect the business long term.
I am going to buy 20 shares at the open tomorrow- Does that sound good?
"I'm wondering how much of this recent fall is related to new construction slowing down. I heard lumber prices are finally coming back down but it's going to take a few weeks for the wholesale market to recognize that drop. Hopefully when the market sees lower lumber prices, new construction will increase and so will the SHW stock price."
"Even though shirleys been in a long time. I got in 1985. Chris conners was president of the west coast. Shw matched my shares. Went thru 3 splits before this one the other day. I only paid 0.23 a share and Shw matched my shares if I would leave Ppg. I’ve heard from soo many people to take some cream off the top. Never did I did add to the shares. 45,000 shares now. The dividends supplement my income for whatever I want. Great at Christmas time."
they crushed earnings. shouldn't this be up by 5%?
"Encouraging article from Barrons (Ben Levisohn) on the outlook for SHW as a good inflation hedge...I agree with Lou, I think that SHW will be $300-325/sh in 8 months.""If leading paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE: SHW) can raise prices without hurting sales, it can keep growing its profit margin even as input prices rise. So says Ben Levisohn's ""Why Sherwin-Williams Stock Has the 'Ultimate Hedge' Against Inflation."""

sorry. new to SHW. I see in 2017 the stock doubled. but why is it not doing well in 2018 and 2019? in my research fi found ace hardware removed SHW and started using a different pain company. is that why? or some ohter fundamental reason for not have so much growth stock wise? I am reading more to invest in this stock.
"Sherwin-Williams Raises GuidanceMonday, June 22, 2020 7:00:00 AM ETSherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) said it expects second quarter revenue of approximately $5.12 billion. The company's previous guidance was for revenue of $4.19 billion to $4.39 billion and the current consensus revenue estimate is $4.33 billion for the quarter ending June 30, 2020."
Nice power grab Morikis. “Mr. Sewell's Chief Operating Officer role will not be filled immediately. Mr. Morikis will serve as President in addition to his current role and assume Mr. Sewell's primary duties and responsibilities.”
I am long SHW. but I don't understand why it went up 2.5% when earnings are not good
"@AB- P/E is high, but take look at other companies that are doing well (e.g. AAPL), their P/E's are high too. The whole market is high, and how much higher it'll go is a matter of debate.Now, about SHW. Disagree completely with you, it will be around for the long haul- in fact that's how you make money in this stock; not by trading, but by buying, holding, reinvesting dividends. Several things to consider 1. SHW has been historically well managed. Generally a conservative management team that doesn't take too many unwarranted risks; 2. Has made or beat its earnings numbers now (with the exception of last quarter's very narrow miss) for how many quarters?; 3. It's acquisition history- very smart move with Valspar and other companies; it also know when to divest unprofitable groups; 4. Stock buy back history- dividends tend to be low, but the company supports its share price; 5. Infrastructure Bill and housing market. Going to be big for coatings. Even if the economy takes a downturn, people still paint their houses."
"Shirley Williams was a rocket today, how 'bout it!! My view is for this kind of movement, it's obviously the hedge funds moving in. And yes, the P/E ratio is quite high and there are raw materials uncertainties, but there is something driving it; and no, I do not think they fudged their numbers for the last quarterly report. It's just well managed, that's all. We'll see what the next earnings bring. It's going to hit 300 before Oct, maybe a pull back first, but it'll hit it. Interesting to see how it finishes the year."
I bought SHW in March 2019 and did DCA'ing Total current Liabilities is 6.2 billion and Total current assests is 5.2 billion.Isn't that a bad metric to have on a balance sheet of a company?
"Lou, Shirley and other long term holders. In Your mult-decade holding of SHW, did you ever see this kind of scenario where raw materials weren't available with supply chain disruptions to SHW company? Is this something first time You folks are experiencing too?"
whats the next sherwin williams stock? I want to buy an undervalued competitor
"No stopping this FREIGHT TRAIN. $340 YEAR END. MY $310 CAME & WENT BY HALLOWEEN LIKE A FERRARI PASSING A PRIUS HYBRID. DIVIDENDS SOON. BUY, HOLD, DRIP"
I 1st bought SHW at $29.00 it had its last split at around $70.00. It has never let me down. I've been in and out for over 20 years. Its been my mainstay. Never sweat this one.
Ship is sinking like the Titanic!!! Down another -9.72 after hours after mgt lowers guidance from only 3 weeks earlier were firm on full year 2021. Now it’s changed that fast? Something is up and expect a big earnings miss and another big fall. See you next Spring.
Why is S-W continuing to tank after they reported higher guidance for Q2 and full year and several other analysts raising their targets as high as 320. Nothing but great news? The other comment about them closing stores and having no tint is wrong. Probably a store forget to order enough tint was the issue. The raw material shortage is improving week by week.
"Down again. I’m going to add a few more shares today! My feeling is they are bringing it down, which gives it more upside here after earnings."
Funny how they did this the second week of September. The full year is the same????
This will be in the $280’s after earnings show what lack of supply did to sales.

"To all the seasoned SHW investors, can you share some thoughts what makes SHW so special? In a world where tech, Fintech, biotech etc drives a lot of attention and gains, what’s proprietary and an advantage for SHW? At first glance, seems to be capital intensive and not much of an economic moat vs say, the tech sector? Thoughts as I am researching the company and may not have all the info. They do seem to have a good track record though. How is their leadership/value prop/ brand value and long term positioning vs competition that’d make them worthy of long term investing?"
"Stock splits mean absolutely nothing is a interesting comment Andrew. Ever hear of a company called Tesla or Apple? Apple would be $25K a share if never split and who would buy it? Tesla went from $1400 to over $4,200 if you aged back to pre split 5 months ago. I’ve owned S-W stock for 36 years since it was $19 a share and with 3 previous splits. No complaints here. I own all 3 and stock splits matter."
Is Sherwin used only in painting houses and commerical buildings or used in automobiles/aircrafts/bridges etc
The move to sell SHW always triggers gains down the line for the BUYER . Very well managed since the days of Carl Bellini . Keep your horizon correct ; collect a nice growing dividend and write some OTM Covered calls and you will like the result.

"@BEV Fan, don't think this ship is sinking- not with a 25% appreciation in share price/last calendar year. Turnover at SHW has always been high, I worked for Shirley 30+ years ago and it was the same in those days. Just the nature of the industry, and granted, SHW was never particularly easy on its employees.Having said that, the last several years have seen some incredible growth for a mature company in a very staid industry. From everything that I've read, we're looking at a good year in 2021 too. Let's see what Thursday's announcement says, that'll be interesting..."
"I just tried to buy exterior paint at my local SHW store and was told they are OUT! I was told it’s nationwide due to supply chain disruptions and lack of key raw materials. The store was EMPTY! Based on this and the crazy rich PE, I bought OTM puts for December. You have been warned. Sell Sell Sell!!!!!!!"
Does SHW stand to benefit from the Infrastructure bill if passed?
"Lou, Shirley has done well this year, very well- how can you argue with a 39% gain in one year. Here's hoping she hits her numbers on Tuesday. BTW, I'm not the Richard that talks it down, but sometimes it SHW does disappoint me when she doesn't hit her earnings."
shw stocks are suffering hang in or run for the hills?
I believe SW is down 21.79 because of the paint shortage..will reflect on this quarters earning
Happy 300 everybody :)
I've been following SHW for years. This is the first time that I can remember that the share price took a beating when Shirley BEAT her earnings. Anybody have any ideas about what happened today?
Look Shw is a long term stock to hold. Yes we all look at it daily which is fine. But only add more shares. Today Thur $322.00. I only reason I was going to sell because it’s w Shw corp. I was going to put those shares in my regular brokerage. Yes it could go up or down.
"Looks like we begin our climb out of the hole. Hope y'all were able to use that drop as a buying opportunity (or at the very least, didn't sell). When the price drops on a pair of shoes that you've been wanting, you use that opportunity to buy those shoes. Same for stocks - buy when it goes on sale. That's my free lesson for the day to some of the folks who are newer to trading."
After reading the full article from S-W they are only slightly lowering 3rd Qtr sales guidance low single digit and income remains unchanged. Full year guidance sales and income remain unchanged. Doesn’t seem that drastic to me?
This stock is an animal. Opened lower and an opportunity to add to my holdings. Will close higher.
"C.J.,don't want to brag.I bought my first shares @ $8.46 a share 30 + years ago by accident.I was hired by C.T.S. (S/W's private fleet) and the management at that time were transfers from S/W accounting and billing departments all with over 20+ years in.I can still hear Mr.MaGaral saying ""This stock plan is one of the best benefits Sherwin-Williams has to offer.""And still is."
"Shares of Sherwin-Williams Co. were indicated up more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday after the paints and coatings company said it will implement a three-for-one split of its common stock, effective April 1. The company said it was setting the stock split ""to make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader base of investors."" The stock split will be in the form of a stock dividend, payable March 31, with shareholders of record on March 23 receiving two additional common shares for each share they own. The stock closed Tuesday at $710.54, which would imply a post-split price of $236.85. The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trading, has rallied 23.6% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 17.8%."
"All big company's will make decisions that are not advantageous to everyone - being a big corporation is tough and requires what seems at times heartless but it's not a social program; it's a corporation and it's responsibility is to the company and it's continuance. It's a tough market out there with global competition. I came to SW by way of acquisition. SW sat on us for a couple years before changes were made - so many grumbled and complained because nobody likes change, many left of their own accord and their harumph, harumph got them nowhere. I was given an opportunity to take another job and stay with SW and instead of whining about how awful everything was I grabbed my smile, wore it all the time, and took that job - and it changed my life. SW is still a great company - change isn't always comfortable."
The 500 richest people in the world lost a combined $135 billion today. Poor Elon Musk lost $7.2B bringing his net worth down to a measly $198B.
"Look at Wednesday’s price action w/ SHW we pierced the $320 resistance level, but did close below it. Nice that we’re in a “channel up” pattern, ."
What a day! “Cover The Earth” my SW friends!
