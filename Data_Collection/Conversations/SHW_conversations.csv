if interest rates go up they have 10 billion in debt. what do you folks think about the stock price?
Anything over 300 I’m a happy camper. On a down day Fri we’re at 305.50. 
Look Shw is a long term stock to hold. Yes we all look at it daily which is fine. But only add more shares. Today Thur $322.00. I only reason I was going to sell because it’s w Shw corp. I was going to put those shares in my regular brokerage. Yes it could go up or down.
"Well, folks, it's almost earnings day. Nice to see a little run up, how about it!"
"Want to own more shares of SHW, but I think the returns from here on are likely going to be subpar if I buy at these levels."
"Rob, Lou, Mike, Shirley , why is SHW going up when earnings are not good. I am long but I am trying to understand"
Did you see the 1st year outlook is $328.35. It was $311.
"SHW has once again surprised everyone by beating consensus EPS. I've been saying it all along...this a well managed company focused heavily on cost savings. Supply chains are an external factor weighing heavily on every industry right now, but they are temporary and the fundamentals haven't changed. I get a lot of blowback when I say these things, but SHW is a good company and the share price speaks for itself."
I bought like 14 gallons of paint and some supplies all from Sherwin Williams in the last 5 weeks. I own a few shares of this company and like to think of it as paying myself to paint. I've been in since before the split and am quite happy with performance thus far.
shw clearly said that due to supply chain issues the earnings will not be good but why is the stock going up in spite of earnings will not be good
"To all the seasoned SHW investors, can you share some thoughts what makes SHW so special? In a world where tech, Fintech, biotech etc drives a lot of attention and gains, what’s proprietary and an advantage for SHW? At first glance, seems to be capital intensive and not much of an economic moat vs say, the tech sector? Thoughts as I am researching the company and may not have all the info. They do seem to have a good track record though. How is their leadership/value prop/ brand value and long term positioning vs competition that’d make them worthy of long term investing?"
"@wbsawk- $280/sharealways possible, but the run up tells me that the big money, which drives this train, knows better."
I am long SHW. but I don't understand why it went up 2.5% when earnings are not good
Basam - Stock has gone up cause I sold at $301 Lol. Zacks has SW with a .3 % sales loss and they missed profit last Qtr with much higher sales. Maybe SW buying back shares to keep rally going leading up to earnings? Now I’ll have to wait to buy back in after earnings report. Oh well - at least my Tesla was up $115 per share today!
watch this rocket after it tops $300...$310 by Halloween!299.58+1.30 (+0.44%)As of 12:28PM EDT. Market open.
"I said $310 by Halloween back in June...a week early I guess. $SHW is a rocketship. Buy, Hold, Drip"
I am long on SHW from March 2019. It has 10 billion debt. Isn't that too much when interest rates go up? can you folks share your opinion?
"Below are comments that CEO John Morikis made on the earnings call. THIS is why SHW is doing so well despite the industry headwinds. Demand is strong and production capabilities are strong. The factors weighing them down are raw material constraints and inflation. RM constraints are temporary but they are working towards working around them in the meantime and inflation, despite being another challenge, is something the company has faced before and managed to profit during anyway.John G. Morikis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer""Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call. First, the demand environment remains robust across our pro architectural and industrial end markets. Many external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive. Demand is not the issue. Second, we are ready to meet this demand. We continue to invest in growth initiatives. We have significant production capacity available today and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters. Our capabilities are not the issue. The issues that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continued to be industrywide raw material availability constraints and inflation. Let me be very clear on how we are responding. Nobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams. We're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on the job better than our competitors. We will continue to focus on customer solutions. We are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses."""
"I’m baffled on what’s an earnings beat. I Love SW and not picking on them. But when Zacks list your EPS last year at 2.76, you report 2.09 and the estimate is 2.07, that’s a 25% loss. Your sales were dead flat with a estimate of dead flat??? It seems with every guidance cut Wallstreet lowers the bar to jump or crawl over for companies to beat. Those are the worst results I’ve seen for SW maybe ever. Could you imagine if Apple sales were flat with a negative 25% EPS over last year what would happen.I’m sure SW would rather have a positive EPS right now and miss a earnings beat. Maybe I’m missing the picture."
This will be in the $280’s after earnings show what lack of supply did to sales.
