Some one. What is wrong with this stock
10/25/19 dividend raised to .93 ? more than a guess..................10/28/16 dividend raised .85 to .87 10/27/17 dividend raised .87 to .89 10/26/18 dividend raised .89 to .91
was looking at the stock 14 days ago and decided not to buy. had MSU years ago and it went to ETR. then sold ETR and never bought back. think this stock will go to $70 and have a reduction in dividend to cover losses. I live in the PCG area and think that the stock should be put sold off to other utilities! When management pays more attention to stock price rather than maintaining assets the stock should go BK and assets sold to other utilities!
my machine learning prediction says we gonna get over 110 in a week. let's see...
I bought as an employee through an automated system. Bought some as high as $120. Wishing it would recover.
