What are some great cheap stocks?
When is this stock going to break out to the upside? Should be at $120.00?

Looking for an entry for next leg up. Target: $98.41 at stoxline.

Screwing retired employees medical plan change.
ETR swings like no other ute. Why?
Is it Possible that Entergy has sold its New York Nuclear Power Plant Indian Point located in Westchester county? This might explain its rising stock prices.
"More frivolous lawsuits to deal with from bums and ambulance chasing lawyers. Need more nuke plants operating at 100% day/night like other industrialized countries. Oh I forgot, we're not an industrialized country anymore."
ETR plans to raise a billion dollars this year in order to maintain their credit rating. Whenever they make the announcement then the stocks going to take a 10% hit at the minimum. I sold the other day & moved my money to another utility until they get the cash raise over with.
"knockin' on 89, crazy high, may let my ira shares go. more profits than 2 years of divs will bring me. run high very fast"
clawing our way back up.

"You know who would win in the ""EV revolution""?The electric utilities. They're cheap and they pay 4 or 5% dividends.$ETRAnd of course $F."
wow there's some out there???this was at $113 moth ago
was looking at the stock 14 days ago and decided not to buy. had MSU years ago and it went to ETR. then sold ETR and never bought back. think this stock will go to $70 and have a reduction in dividend to cover losses. I live in the PCG area and think that the stock should be put sold off to other utilities! When management pays more attention to stock price rather than maintaining assets the stock should go BK and assets sold to other utilities!
tomorrow i think we get something
"can someone explain why $ETR is down? The earning are good, yield high. Seriously, what news/forcast/situtation am I not hearing about?"

Someone can't get enough shares. They must think the companies about to be bought out.
Below 100 we go.
This is the most volatile utility I've ever seen. I'm not sure what's causing the swings but buying the dips & selling the rips has been sweet.
Back up to 110 soon.

Immovable force meets unstoppable object now that ETR has seen performance % (ytd) settled at the neutral level of 3.27%. Possible pullback with some downside but also possible upside. I started receiving notifications from awesomestock-s the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
