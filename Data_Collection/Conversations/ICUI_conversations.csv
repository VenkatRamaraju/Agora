"Smiths' safety needle catalog (#2 in revenue after BD) is outdated and in need of new technology. Why is Smiths selling it? The ProtectIV was the first safety IV catheter introduced by Luther Medical and sold through acquisition multiple times. Apparently, the SuperCath 5 (version of off-patent BD Autoguard) acquisition is not gaining market share, so they are apparently buying Smiths' market position The 2002 Bioplexus acquisition of the PunctureGuard blood collection went nowhere. Smiths does have imaging consumables, but needs an expanded catalog (access kits, catheters, etc.) to better compete in the highly profitable interventional space. A 5 year Chart share price comparison (9/9/21) of Abbott to Teleflex to ICU translates to share increases of 214.7% to 122.6% to 106.7% respectively (and the ICUI 106.7% includes the price bump since yesterday). ICUI now will be going head to head with BD/Bard, so that is a very formidable task."
See my comments below. Wow did I time that right. Got lucky today.

Business model for last 14 years: rob the aging assets (book value?) from Hospira (Pfizer). Looks like that model ended. Now ICU needs real R&D.... are they ready? Still a hokey Design Control procedure?

The basic problem here is that they didn't get the deal for free. They had to pay for it (an even trade) so the stock shouldn't have gone up much at all. It's fundamentally just a swap.

This stock is evaluated as a tech company. It is not a real stock as it is owned mosty by instituitions who force it up. at best this thing is worth 10$ per share. it's gonna fail. the growth is slowing even tho it beat earnings. it's called squeezing the shorts

"Q2 Earnings missed analyst's projection by $0.07. Only $1.99 per share, not $2.07. I see estimated 2019 Earnings at nearing $1.2 BILLION for ICU Medical. I see no reason for a 33% DROP in STOCK value today. Earnings was short maybe $20-30 Million, so Company Market Value goes DOWN $1.5 BILLION in less than 24 hours? Fickle Investors!"
