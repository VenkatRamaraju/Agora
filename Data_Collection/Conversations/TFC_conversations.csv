Great job Kelly and the BOD the share price is now almost back to the per share price of BBT in 1998.
TFC reached a 52 Week low at 41.53
TDC's very nice earnings about completely missed and ignored by the market also the dividend increase swept under the rug.
84 cents for 4th qtr compared to 80 cents estimated! Another all-time high for stock price today. Happy to have held on to old BB&T for all these years.
66% of yesterday's 8/12 trading volume was shorting. Highly manipulated.
TFC reached an all time high at 63.33
Buy all good banks and hold - $BAC $JPM $DFS $PNC $TFC $C $WFC $GS plus 30% to 40% time for banks to bounce as they were all financially strong 
"Just wondering if the top executives and BOD took care of themselves as in my opinion they usually do? It will be interesting to find out if all the stock options, grants and other perks they get will all now vest immediately rather then them having to wait until they are due."
any guesses on P/E after earnings?
I wish you guys would stick to BBT and quit spamming for your pie in the sky stock pick sites.
"Truist Financial Corporation came out with quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share, beating the Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 32.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.18, delivering a surprise of 5.36%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times."
TFC is up 4.92% to 54.74
"Although i sold my position today, totally plan to get back in mid next week. Its nothing but market reaction"
"It was over before it started, with the Media in cahoots along with the Deep State now pull all your money out of the markets and go short term CDs until rates soar with the ""New"" leaders tax hikes and spending rates will surge and you can lock in good returns then until the pendulum swings back"
Will preferred stock certificates remain the same or will there be new issues?
"Florence impact on BBT, any speculation especially insurance costs?"
"BB&T stock is setting new all time highs, thousand dollar bonuses paid out to employees making news after tax plan passed, and yet there are still these constant ""cup half empty"" complainers. Go figure..."
Great job BB&T. You have my support.
"WASHINGTON, March 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Thursday it would likely remove income-based restrictions on bank dividends and share buybacks for ""most firms"" in June after its next round of stress tests."
Watch out extremely oversold. Big move up coming.
TFC is down 4.91% to 56.76
$ 57.70 after hours ?
new 52 week high !
Very positive conference call. Best is coming.
"terrific article in Barron's this week ""Truist is set to enjoy the fruits of its merger"". Target for TFC $45"
All time high today. Congrats to all investors!
"BB&T and SunTrust Agree $66 Billion Merger to Create 6th Biggest U.S. BankMartin Baccardax,TheStreet.com•February 7, 2019The all-stock deal will seen SunTrust investors receiving 1.295 shares of BB&T for each stock they own, as well as a 5% increased in their dividend, with BB&T owning 57% of the combined group's $28.24 billion in equity to 43% for SunTrust. ""This is a true merger of equals, combining the best of both companies to create the premier financial institution of the future,"" said BB&T CEO Kelly King.

TFC reached a 52 Week high at 55.99
"Noticed there were 2 full page advertisements in the Wall Street Journal today paid for by Truist Financial Corp. One was a full page picture of John Lewis and the other was a full page picture of Cordy ""CT"" Vivian. Just wondering how much money the top executives and Board of Directors have spend their personal money on these type things?"
BBT-PG reached a new 52 Week Low at $23.32
The transition being very poorly managed if managed at all. If it is the CFO who is running it he has to GO NOW. You can't get into your accounts and you can't get through to anyone on the phone. They have until Sunday to get it fixed or I am gone. I have been with BB4&T for over 15 years and have >$2MM invested. I liked BB&T but so far Truist sucks.
""" -- Citigroup Inc. and Truist Financial Corp. are among banks that have been selling off hundreds of millions of leveraged loans to help unwind swap trades tied to the debt, according to people familiar with the matter."" This is from an article I ran across. How does this affect TFC's earnings?"
"Good earnings report.Integration going well between the two banks.As Charles Swab said: ""which would you rather do, put your money in the bank or own the bank?"""
"It won't be long now until the BOD will issue stock options and grants. I'm guessing that they will as usual give out lots and lots of options and grants even with the action of the stock price. In my opinion it seems as if top management and the BOD gets lots of stock options, grants, pay and benefits regardless of how the shareholders fair."
Nice move up today 2/2 considering 65% of trading volume was shorting.
"Stockguru, agreed, though unfortunately I bought back in yesterday, but will buy more to average out, in my opinion best of the regionals though analysts really don't show it the love as much as PNC or Banks of the Ozarks."
Hopefully the merger expense is the main cause for the huge drop.
"TFC -23155 is the actual new common stock ,the one labeled Truist Financial selling for around $25 must be a preferred stock.Yahoo has both linked to this comments section I believe."
"Repeat again from my previous post: Still, a lot of room to ""buy all good banks and hold - $BAC $JPM $DFS $PNC $TFC $C $WFC $GS plus 30% to 40% time for banks to bounce as they were all financially strong  - Already 20% up on average as of now... $DFS gave 40% already. But keeping them all as we see banks sectors trending up slowly. GLTA!"
TFC-PF reached a 52 Week low at 21.98
"Had 3 accounts with Suntrust-after merger was being charged $20 a month per account since I didn't have $10,000 in each. Closed all accounts and moved to a non fee credit union. You can only charge so many fees that business goes elsewhere. Oh still have been a stock holder with BBT for over 30 years."

BBT is down -5.04% to 51.11
they said the board will consider raising quarterly dividend from .41 to. .45 at the next board meeting
.45 cents Dividend announced today. About time for an increase.
BBT-PG reached a new 52 Week Low at $21.90
Maybe the new name actually means it is the truth that they take care of the executives and Board of Directors regardless of the shareholders returns. Just another example of the logic by the executive team and BOD like paying 4 of the top executives who have positions with the combined company millions of dollars to agree to stay.
BBT reached a new All Time High at 51.64
Tfc is a solid one. Grabbing a few more and some CVS
"even if the covid interruption results in a month of quarantine, this selloff is based in fear and stupidity. long term this is but a blip on the radar."
BBT reached a new All Time High at 53.07
What a fantastic day to be a shareholder here! :)
BBT-PF reached a new 52 Week Low at $23.00
"Great. New Corp Treasurer from STI background. The BBT legacy was long, strong and proud. K had to do something to make his name shine! Oh well."
Truist? I think they should spend a few more months looking for a name. The name they picked is pretty bad.
Hold $BAC $JPM $TFC for long - as soon as fed comes back and talks about inflation then about some interest rate.. these will ho double. Less than 90 days for elections - GLTA
TFC needs to stay the hello out of politics especially this day and time.
kinda #$%$ with my dividend check today! only up 58 dollars with 600 moe shares! this merger was not at all beneficial. my suntrust shares are not worth as much as they were before merger!
Love these sell offs. Manipulated orchestrated events.
This bank has some nice profit generating components : And a LOT of cost cutting opportunities with the merger and technological advances. Just wish top people and board would be commensurate with taking money/stock from the company . Would add value credibility.
Good time to add today at $50.
I back the truck up and buy everytime bbt/TFC dips. Have been rewarded handsomely!
"Why is dividend still $,52 less than before recession?"
Great job Kelly King and executives and it appears the investment community liked your presentation.
"I believe today is the last day for the BBT ticker symbol. I'll miss it. Used to joke that BBT was code for ""Bubba Banks Thar."" Monday it will be TFC. End of an era. I may never get used to saying Truist."
With a nearly 15% pullback from recent highs we are adding to our TFC position. One of the most well manged regional banks with a strong balance sheet and increasing dividend. Moving forward banks are an inflation hedge. When interest rates rise banks earn more on the spread.Strong buy under $56.00.Do your due diligence and be careful out there.Best of fortune to all.
Great long term buy. Covid pandemic will make them come out stronger.
Everyone be sure to read the Background of the Merger on pages 50 to 54 of the merger proxy. According to the way I read this is that that Rogers and King were a lot more concerned about and there was lots more discussion about who was going to run the combined company. Who the executives would be and what time would King give up the chair and CEO job. Lots and lots of discussion about the above even before the price was settled.
Special thanks to whoever sold at 52.95.
Kelly King stock price 12/31/2004 $42.05 great job creating shareholder value.
TRUIST has become a robo bank. It is not possible to talk to a real person. The only way to address a problem is through CHAT. I have enter my question and have waited for 10 minutes twice and the website has timed out my connection. So much for good service. I guess that went away with BB&T.
TFC-PF is down 7.84% to 21.40
Any thoughts about why such a large jump this morning?
Priced for maybe a $1.50 swing. Hoping is does less than a $1.
is this a good deal for us??
BoD obviously has no inclination to stop the bleeding.
Very nice and caring bank for its employees!
Down 36% from 1.5 months ago - Never seen anything like it.
Their web site is down again....
"This bank checks on almost all the ratio, balance checks and financial stability checks. I can't believe we are getting it at such a discount! Extremely bullish."
"Was told today, that the name change will be official on Friday 6 Dec 2019."
"I work here, giddy up. Formally STI"
$54.27 close as of 2/7/2020Truist Financial Corporation (TFC) sounds really good to me!!
"None of the branches in my area have changed the name to Truist. What's up with that?Dividend payout around the first of the month was nice though, very nice, and steady, very solid, dividend, very dependable, very DRIP-able."
"Once again I voted my proxy against any director over 62. 10 out of 15 were ""Nays"".I also voted proxies of VZ, HP and GE. Out of the three only voted down 3.Why are 15 old directors needed for one institution?"
"Agree, what is wrong with BBT. Change costly and has new market equity."

You all should either answer you phone in less than 3 minutes or respond to email questions in less than 3 days. Keep up this poor customer service or I'm switching banks. My private banker is really going to hear about this.
Just wondering when the shareholders will get an increase in the dividend? Employees are getting raises and bonuses due to the tax reform according to the news. Will the shareholders get left out?
TFC-PF reached a 52 Week low at 22.52
Very nice increase in the dividend announced today. 13%+ increase if my math is correct. I would guess another increase later this year if regulations change for required capital. Thanks BB&T!
"BB&T can't even run an efficient online platform. It has been down all night and still down. Best Bank in Town...sure thing, LOL."
Five month low set today with record earnings. Down $10 or 18% in 30 trading days.
TFC's short interest yesterday was 68%. Why so high.
BBT hasn't done a thing in 2018! Time to move on?
Just need to cut more jobs and push those in the branches to cross sell more than ever before then we can see even more outstanding profits!

Financial value rotations has not started yet.. stay tight guys.. Can $BAC $JPM $TFC $C has more long shot soon.. transportation and energy started these upside once banks joins - S&P and RUT to year high..
Origin House $ORHOF shareholder (soon to be acquired by Cresco Labs $CRLBF ) now following Trichome $TFC.V to track the asset.
Technical indicators at foxchart are showing great signs of upside potential.
CEO talked about this on CNBC. consolidation coming next.
I've forgotten. Did TFC lower dividend?
BBT reached a new All Time High at 52.17
BBT setting 52 week lows almost daily. But looks like all financials are taking a beating. As 2018 comes to a close I think we are seeing lots of selling from those who think a recession is just around the corner. They may be right but for now banks are in good shape with much stronger balance sheets than in 2008 and tighter controls on risk. Buffet has been buying the largest banks which makes me think now might be a good time to buy. 2019 may be a year to remember - hopefully for good.
TFC is down 4.93% to 41.46
BBT reached a new All Time High at 52.71
TFC is up 9.00% to 29.66
Merger surprise announced today! Sun Trust will join BB&T to become the 6th largest financial institution. Nicely accretive to GAAP as well. I think we will see more M&A this year as banks look for ways to cut costs. Good move BB&T!
"Guess you can't ""truist"" management. Not a happy camper."
Nice price for TFC. Could not resist.
"I’m thinking an earnings beat is in the offing tomorrow morning. Price and volume flow last two days, together with recent upwards earnings estimate revisions bode well in this regard."
TFC is up 9.94% to 32.58
"At $35.00 Truist is paying just over a 5% dividend. Anyone who has a DRIP in Truist is benefiting... for now.Back in the ""Great Recession"" the dividend yield went as high as 11% before it was cut.This is different, yet worth watching."
They had some interesting insights about TFC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
TFC is up 5.39% to 50.06
"Wow BBT share price is getting close to what it was per share in December 1998. Guess the current BOD, Kelly King and the other executives will now get paid like John Allison and his BOD to increase the share price above the 1998 price. Just who is looking out for the shareholders interests?"
The drop was from the dilution of shares outstanding. The BOD's exercised the options received for the transaction.Why do we need 22 BOD's?
hope a dividend increase coming soon
TFC was recommended as a buy on CNBC. Any thoughts?
Is it too late to buy in tomorrow?
"I bank with them and they are a good bank. Ive had a few before but these guys actually impress me, imo they are better then BOA."

"Back in December 2008 the share price of BB&T plunged to just over $16.00 per share.Short sellers appeared on this message board bashing the bank daily.Now, after the merger, all is quiet as the last top post was last month.So much nicer....just saying..."
TFC down about 8% in two days. What am i missing. I added but 8 %.
Best banks are down the most.
And now a lawsuit from Trulient Credit Union regarding the new name. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
"I see there are comments on employees 1 - 2 % raises over the past 8 years because of no inflation . That's funny . No inflation . This is from a ""trusted advisor"" characterized by the "" do good "" ""ethical company "" . See what healthcare, college, etc price increases have been over an 8 year period ."

"Is there anyone else out there who wonders just what why we are paying the BODO and executives so much? BBT share price was $40 plus change in 1998 and ended today at $41.94 a share. Earnings estimates are deceasing both for 2017 and 2018. Yet, the BOD and executive team is still receiving lots of dollars and other perks. Just wondering why?"
I used to work for Truist and left because the merger was the worst thing they could have done. It’s been a disaster and nobody who works there is happy.

"if Maxine waters is against the merger, then it's bound to be a super good thing."
I can't believe they stuck with the Truist name change.I'm reading articles here that keep calling it Trust.
Is Kelly King beginning to show signs of dementia? Naming a bank Truist. The name is an auto spelling error. It implies falsehood by the mechanism of point insertion of i into Trust. Naming the Merger iTrust which would not be very original but would have a better ring and marketing advantage. Putting it up to a yes man panel instead of the general public is a blunder. In molecular biology and Genetics a point insertion can render a living organism defunct.
"someone check, I think my TFC is broken... it's going up"

"Buyout, get rid of redundant top level management, greatly reduce the now inefficient number of BOD members, consolidate branch network, in other words clean both houses to make this work for we shareholders."
Wow. Don't remember a drop this big. Down $4.00. :(
have to agree. bod and execs seem to be very well compensated vice their peers.
I heard at the water fountain outside the main office earnings will be good.
TFC is down 4.91% to 54.96
"Before we talk about the shareholders, I think it’s worth pointing out that employees have taken it on the chin for the past 8+ years with relatively small Year over year wage increases of 1-2%, and many, many layoffs of really superb people to boost up shareholder returns"
good results. thinking oversold long term.

"If you are a BB&T employee, please be aware that SunTrust paricipates in an illegal counter intelligence harassment program run by corrupt law enforcement in the DHS, FBI and Atlanta PD among others. The organization called InfraGard may also be involved.They use staff to stage Truman Show style interactions with people who have been targeted by law enforcement over political disagreements. The information disclosed in the interaction is intended to create an impression of being stalked, followed, surveilled.At the same time targets are subjected to stalking outside the office by people known as surveillance role players as well as private detectives. The apparent goals are numerous: to cause paranoia and trauma, make you leave your job and if possible cause you to be institutionalized for mental health issues or crime.It is a safety issue for BB&T staff and you should be aware but corrupt execs will not tell you since they only care about stock prices."
"What am I missing , fed raise's rates and bank stocks go down ?"
Voted Yes for merger & No for the name change. I'm guessing both will pass though. Will this require 2/3rds approval?
on a good note. The 22 BOD's options are underwater.
let the dividends roll in
now TFC increase the dividends
Can anyone tell me why executive compensation of 9% is justified when thousands of associates were laid off in 2017 to cut costs to drive up the share price
TFC is up 11.07% to 47.75
"Four BB&T executives were offered compensation to ""promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate and achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger,"" the filing read. Those four executives are Daryl Bible, chief financial officer; Donna Goodrich, treasurer; Christopher Henson, president and chief operating officer; and Clarke Starnes, chief risk officer.The nearly $13 million in Synergy Incentive Awards will be paid in two installments. Thirty-three percent will vest on Aug. 1, 2021, or earlier if the bank systems are fully converted sooner than that. The rest will vest on Jan. 15, 2022. Bible and Starnes will each receive $3.11 million. They plan to stay on as CFO and CRO, respectively, at the combined institution. Both are still eligible for the two installments even if they decide to retire after Aug. 1, 2021, but before the second vesting date, according to the filing.Henson will receive $4.16 million. He has agreed to stay on as COO at the new bank. And Goodrich will receive $2.58 million. She will stay with the combined bank as corporate treasurer."
"Earnings update - Bank of America just reported earnings that were slightly lower than anylysts expectations. Revenue: $21.6 billion, just under the $21.8 billion estimate.The company said that revenue fell 4% from a year earlier, driven by a 6% drop in net interest income because of lower interest rates.This is the reason we are long on Truist Financial. Inflation is gaining momentum across the board. Moving forward The fed will have no choice but to gradually pull back on quantitative easing. Interest rates will gradually have to rise to keep inflation in check. Banks gather deposits and extend loans; falling interest rates squeeze the margin between what they pay depositors and charge borrowers. Conversely when interest rates rise even slightly banks will reap higher profits. This is exactly where you want to invest in a rising interest rate environment. Even if Truist reports earnings for one quarter that are below expectations we will hold our positions as an inflation hedge. This is a long term hold. With the announced dividend increase the divvy will be over 3.5% annually. This is a solid compounding return even if the stock price stays flat. When rates rise we will enjoy capital gains in addition to the divvy. Solid inflation hedge producing 3.5% income. If the price pulls back on earnings we will be adding to our positions for the income and long term capital gains. As always do your due diligence and be careful out there. Markets are frothy. We seek safety over high growth. Best of fortune to all."
better start showing some of the cost savings from the merger no one wanted.
Dividend is coming 4.6%
Expect TFC to drop more. Possibly 32-31 range
"I am long term Suntrust customer and am now with Truist. I am concerned about the security measures/ protocol Truist has for on line banking services. They do not allow me to set up 2 factor authentication to log in. This feature is optional or automatic, for all other banking, investment, medical, insurance, etc companies whom I work with and basically is standard protocol for them. I called Truist customer service and the person told me 2 factor it is not offered. He basically said this is how it is and there was no one I could talk to express my concerns. After pressings him further to hopefully speak with someone, he hung up on me.I am bullish on the banking sector in general, but will not invest in Truist. I will also look to move my personal and business banking from Truist because of this."
"Charles Schwab once said: ""which would you rather do, put your money in the bank, or own the bank?"""
"Fantastic job top executives and BOD. I hope you realize your per share price on the stock is now less than $6.00 from the per share price of BBT stock in December 1998. However, I guess you probably like that because now a lot of you will get paid big bucks and benefits to increase the share price again even though you have already been paid to do that in the past.."
Started the year at 50 and back to it. How much are we paying senior management for nothing?
Great earning closing lots of branches and down we go to no where.
"2000 shares at $29.50. Probably the first time ever I've bought any stock at the bottom. I wish I had purchased more. It's an amazing gift to even get this stock in the mid-30s, much less high 20s."
If you own this stock and it was BBT you had better love the dividend because a share of stock in BBT was over $40 in 1998. The executives and Board of Directors have been paid very well over and over and the long term shareholders get what?
