TDC's very nice earnings about completely missed and ignored by the market also the dividend increase swept under the rug.
They had some interesting insights about TFC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
TFC needs to stay the hello out of politics especially this day and time.
"Good earnings report.Integration going well between the two banks.As Charles Swab said: ""which would you rather do, put your money in the bank or own the bank?"""
"Before we talk about the shareholders, I think itâ€™s worth pointing out that employees have taken it on the chin for the past 8+ years with relatively small Year over year wage increases of 1-2%, and many, many layoffs of really superb people to boost up shareholder returns"
$ 57.70 after hours ?
This bank has some nice profit generating components : And a LOT of cost cutting opportunities with the merger and technological advances. Just wish top people and board would be commensurate with taking money/stock from the company . Would add value credibility.

TFC reached an all time high at 63.33
Their web site is down again....
new 52 week high !
TRUIST has become a robo bank. It is not possible to talk to a real person. The only way to address a problem is through CHAT. I have enter my question and have waited for 10 minutes twice and the website has timed out my connection. So much for good service. I guess that went away with BB&T.
The transition being very poorly managed if managed at all. If it is the CFO who is running it he has to GO NOW. You can't get into your accounts and you can't get through to anyone on the phone. They have until Sunday to get it fixed or I am gone. I have been with BB4&T for over 15 years and have >$2MM invested. I liked BB&T but so far Truist sucks.
Think Jamie Dimon is correct about cryptocurrency. Think cryptocurrency will be the next financial collapse.
Special thanks to whoever sold at 52.95.
"I am long term Suntrust customer and am now with Truist. I am concerned about the security measures/ protocol Truist has for on line banking services. They do not allow me to set up 2 factor authentication to log in. This feature is optional or automatic, for all other banking, investment, medical, insurance, etc companies whom I work with and basically is standard protocol for them. I called Truist customer service and the person told me 2 factor it is not offered. He basically said this is how it is and there was no one I could talk to express my concerns. After pressings him further to hopefully speak with someone, he hung up on me.I am bullish on the banking sector in general, but will not invest in Truist. I will also look to move my personal and business banking from Truist because of this."
Great job Kelly and the BOD the share price is now almost back to the per share price of BBT in 1998.
"Just wondering if the top executives and BOD took care of themselves as in my opinion they usually do? It will be interesting to find out if all the stock options, grants and other perks they get will all now vest immediately rather then them having to wait until they are due."
Love these sell offs. Manipulated orchestrated events.
