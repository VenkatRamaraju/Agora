on a good note. The 22 BOD's options are underwater.
I used to work for Truist and left because the merger was the worst thing they could have done. It’s been a disaster and nobody who works there is happy.
"If you are a BB&T employee, please be aware that SunTrust paricipates in an illegal counter intelligence harassment program run by corrupt law enforcement in the DHS, FBI and Atlanta PD among others. The organization called InfraGard may also be involved.They use staff to stage Truman Show style interactions with people who have been targeted by law enforcement over political disagreements. The information disclosed in the interaction is intended to create an impression of being stalked, followed, surveilled.At the same time targets are subjected to stalking outside the office by people known as surveillance role players as well as private detectives. The apparent goals are numerous: to cause paranoia and trauma, make you leave your job and if possible cause you to be institutionalized for mental health issues or crime.It is a safety issue for BB&T staff and you should be aware but corrupt execs will not tell you since they only care about stock prices."

"It won't be long now until the BOD will issue stock options and grants. I'm guessing that they will as usual give out lots and lots of options and grants even with the action of the stock price. In my opinion it seems as if top management and the BOD gets lots of stock options, grants, pay and benefits regardless of how the shareholders fair."
does bbt have a new ticker symbol? my quote wont up date from dec 6.
"Wow BBT share price is getting close to what it was per share in December 1998. Guess the current BOD, Kelly King and the other executives will now get paid like John Allison and his BOD to increase the share price above the 1998 price. Just who is looking out for the shareholders interests?"

Everyone be sure to read the Background of the Merger on pages 50 to 54 of the merger proxy. According to the way I read this is that that Rogers and King were a lot more concerned about and there was lots more discussion about who was going to run the combined company. Who the executives would be and what time would King give up the chair and CEO job. Lots and lots of discussion about the above even before the price was settled.

"Four BB&T executives were offered compensation to ""promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate and achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger,"" the filing read. Those four executives are Daryl Bible, chief financial officer; Donna Goodrich, treasurer; Christopher Henson, president and chief operating officer; and Clarke Starnes, chief risk officer.The nearly $13 million in Synergy Incentive Awards will be paid in two installments. Thirty-three percent will vest on Aug. 1, 2021, or earlier if the bank systems are fully converted sooner than that. The rest will vest on Jan. 15, 2022. Bible and Starnes will each receive $3.11 million. They plan to stay on as CFO and CRO, respectively, at the combined institution. Both are still eligible for the two installments even if they decide to retire after Aug. 1, 2021, but before the second vesting date, according to the filing.Henson will receive $4.16 million. He has agreed to stay on as COO at the new bank. And Goodrich will receive $2.58 million. She will stay with the combined bank as corporate treasurer."
I've forgotten. Did TFC lower dividend?

With a nearly 15% pullback from recent highs we are adding to our TFC position. One of the most well manged regional banks with a strong balance sheet and increasing dividend. Moving forward banks are an inflation hedge. When interest rates rise banks earn more on the spread.Strong buy under $56.00.Do your due diligence and be careful out there.Best of fortune to all.
"And so it begins, the creation of another bloated US financial system behemoth that profits are slow to decaying."
The drop was from the dilution of shares outstanding. The BOD's exercised the options received for the transaction.Why do we need 22 BOD's?

Maybe the new name actually means it is the truth that they take care of the executives and Board of Directors regardless of the shareholders returns. Just another example of the logic by the executive team and BOD like paying 4 of the top executives who have positions with the combined company millions of dollars to agree to stay.

TRUIST has become a robo bank. It is not possible to talk to a real person. The only way to address a problem is through CHAT. I have enter my question and have waited for 10 minutes twice and the website has timed out my connection. So much for good service. I guess that went away with BB&T.
Nice price for TFC. Could not resist.
I back the truck up and buy everytime bbt/TFC dips. Have been rewarded handsomely!

"My Mother has a savings account with TFC and their interest rate has slowly gone down from 1.14% to .01% over the last year. .15 cents she makes on $12,040 a month. In the 1970s & 1980s the CD rates were posted in the lobby but at TFC it's a big secret. I like a stock with a lively message board and I bought TFC today at $32.88 because of the dividend. CODX has a nice MB and swings $10 a month up and down. Musical chairs for gamblers trying to upgrade to a Porshe."
Technical indicators at foxchart are showing great signs of upside potential.
I see a dividend cut coming.. hope I wrong
Very nice increase in the dividend announced today. 13%+ increase if my math is correct. I would guess another increase later this year if regulations change for required capital. Thanks BB&T!

"even if the covid interruption results in a month of quarantine, this selloff is based in fear and stupidity. long term this is but a blip on the radar."
"The following is from an interesting article posted on AOL.BBT's total yield of just over 5% is far too low to get people excited about owning the stock and the CCAR for this year highlighted just how much BBT is spending on its acquisitions that is no longer available for return to shareholders. Whether that sort of thing bothers you or not is personal preference but for me, without sizable returns, BBT is just another average bank that likes to overspend on acquisitions. Yes, its safety and soundness is terrific but meaningful earnings growth is probably still years off and without capital returns to boost what shareholders receive, I still don't see a reason to own BBT at this point. The dividend is great but that's it and given BBT's incessant need to buy competitors, that is likely to be the story for a long time to come."

If you own this stock and it was BBT you had better love the dividend because a share of stock in BBT was over $40 in 1998. The executives and Board of Directors have been paid very well over and over and the long term shareholders get what?

BBT setting 52 week lows almost daily. But looks like all financials are taking a beating. As 2018 comes to a close I think we are seeing lots of selling from those who think a recession is just around the corner. They may be right but for now banks are in good shape with much stronger balance sheets than in 2008 and tighter controls on risk. Buffet has been buying the largest banks which makes me think now might be a good time to buy. 2019 may be a year to remember - hopefully for good.

66% of yesterday's 8/12 trading volume was shorting. Highly manipulated.
Is Kelly King beginning to show signs of dementia? Naming a bank Truist. The name is an auto spelling error. It implies falsehood by the mechanism of point insertion of i into Trust. Naming the Merger iTrust which would not be very original but would have a better ring and marketing advantage. Putting it up to a yes man panel instead of the general public is a blunder. In molecular biology and Genetics a point insertion can render a living organism defunct.

TFC-PF is up 5.33% to 24.06
Is BB&T ashamed of their yearly earnings comparisons? Just received the proxy and it doesn't appear in the part with Kelly King's statements. Probably by design since the top executive's pay increased and I think 2017 earnings were actually below the 2016 earnings.
"Charles Schwab once said: ""which would you rather do, put your money in the bank, or own the bank?"""

The yield curve is a gigantic problem for banks. They still borrow short and lend long as their business which dwarfs all their customer fees associated with branch banking. Banking is a government created monopoly that spars over new customers and presumes selling other services like insurance and investment counseling. Which banks have an edge? Hard to think it’s B.B. & T.

"I like where the conversation is going with Trump talking about re-instituting Glass-Steagall and breaking up the big banks. BBT has already gotten out of the investment business and this would open up opportunities to expand while the big banks reel trying to recoup margins and profitability with the loss of the investment side of the business. You would see C, BAC, WFC, JMP and GS reel for quite some time as they are broken up and the investment banking side has to find new sources of capital after they lose the commercial banking assets and the marketing that the commercial side allows them as well. Great opportunity for BBT."

"Before we talk about the shareholders, I think it’s worth pointing out that employees have taken it on the chin for the past 8+ years with relatively small Year over year wage increases of 1-2%, and many, many layoffs of really superb people to boost up shareholder returns"
"Is there anyone else out there who wonders just what why we are paying the BODO and executives so much? BBT share price was $40 plus change in 1998 and ended today at $41.94 a share. Earnings estimates are deceasing both for 2017 and 2018. Yet, the BOD and executive team is still receiving lots of dollars and other perks. Just wondering why?"
"Earnings update - Bank of America just reported earnings that were slightly lower than anylysts expectations. Revenue: $21.6 billion, just under the $21.8 billion estimate.The company said that revenue fell 4% from a year earlier, driven by a 6% drop in net interest income because of lower interest rates.This is the reason we are long on Truist Financial. Inflation is gaining momentum across the board. Moving forward The fed will have no choice but to gradually pull back on quantitative easing. Interest rates will gradually have to rise to keep inflation in check. Banks gather deposits and extend loans; falling interest rates squeeze the margin between what they pay depositors and charge borrowers. Conversely when interest rates rise even slightly banks will reap higher profits. This is exactly where you want to invest in a rising interest rate environment. Even if Truist reports earnings for one quarter that are below expectations we will hold our positions as an inflation hedge. This is a long term hold. With the announced dividend increase the divvy will be over 3.5% annually. This is a solid compounding return even if the stock price stays flat. When rates rise we will enjoy capital gains in addition to the divvy. Solid inflation hedge producing 3.5% income. If the price pulls back on earnings we will be adding to our positions for the income and long term capital gains. As always do your due diligence and be careful out there. Markets are frothy. We seek safety over high growth. Best of fortune to all."
