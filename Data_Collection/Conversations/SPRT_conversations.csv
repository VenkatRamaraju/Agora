#1 FLOAT 9.31mil shares#2 SI 7.47mil shares#3 FTDs 880.000 shares I wonder what is left?? How can they cover?? Do you now see why they dont want you to know about this and why they wont let this trend... BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER EVEN IF THEY WANT TO...#WeNameThePrice #ThisIsSPRTa #IamSPRTacus
A thing of beauty how this setting up. As I have said today will be a tug of war with GREEN taking control big time in the end.
NO PANIC This was $26 the other day and BOUNCED BACK It will Do IT Again $40 Plus by end of day
Congrats SPRT winners…plow those gains into A M C to continue the journey!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
No reason to sell until the shorts cover. set a sell limit for a hundy plus and don't even watch it.
"And over 71.5M traded just today. What's not to love...Float 9.31M% Held by Insiders 37.77%% Held by Institutions 52.31%Shares Short (Aug 13, 2021) 6.18MShort % of Float (Aug 13, 2021) 67.01%"
"Clearly, there is a concerted effort to keep the SP under $42… Shorts know exactly what time it is and they know that if it crosses that mark that this stock is going to $50+ in a hurry! "
They had some interesting insights about SPRT on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"This is a gamma squeeze people, and we've just started. The whole options chain is in the money, how are they going to solve this? They won't. And no shares left to borrow, while at a 102% interest rate. Yeah good luck with that shorties! I am easily holding this over the weekend, and then another two weeks minimum."
"THANKS FOR THE SUPER CHEAP SHARES EARLIER, SHORTIESLMAOOOOOOOO"
"HOLD. Shorts are doubling down, looking for paper hands. New FTD rules go into effect tomorrow. Shields up, SPRTans!! HOLD THE LINE"
I just got $25k that i will be adding at the dip. Holding 6100 shares at $8 lets go
"Shorts be Like..... ""I should of covered weeks ago""......."
CNBC Talking about SPRT now!
Everyone needs to check out the Comparison to GME Charts to see how this will play out..!
Trying to figure out who bwon is. I'll investigate him
Schwab securities is sending emails out to their clients that currently own Ssprt shares asking them if they want to lend their shares to the firm due to shortage and high demand from other financial firmsHold your shares and buy more if you can    
The shorts will be the only ones left holding the bag when they get margin called and forced to buy at triple digits!
"Updated SI from Ortex is now 69.45%, means even after Friday the SI has not moved much at all. Still alot of ways to go!"
"Everyone, just sit back and remember we’re up 33%, closer to 40% AH from Thursday’s close. Of course ppl took gains and some panic selling will always take place. It is normal and will re-test 60 and likely surpass. As long we are setting higher highs and higher lows we’re golden."
"LIKE I SAID, google FTDs if you don't know what they are.They were starting to be handed out AH today getting ready for tomorrow. We will open over 50$ tomorrow. This is like taking candy from a baby..I'd be extremely worried tonight if I was short here. Lmao"
"I'm fueling this rocket pre market. Let's do this, we can make it happen."
$85 strike! New option chain. 
I just need it to get @100 ish so I can afford to pay for my mom chemotherapy praise the lord
"after todays trading ortex data shows 7,48mil shares short... we got a gold mine here guys... shuld run much higher than 100$"
Please read this before selling if you’re leaning towards selling. Hopefully it helps with your decision. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/49951726-biotechplayer123/5625005-support-com-sprt-is-1-short-squeeze-stock-for-august-new-price-target-of-36-bitcoin-merger
I just bought 2000 shares. Wish me luck
Anyway this is confirmed that the squeeze is not done yet... because if it did we would have been below 30 like friday i support will add more on dips!!!
"The shorts that were ghosts yesterday in here ""Panic Commenting""thinking a this msg board will help them....a msg board...BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!BUY AND HOLD WHILE SHORTS FOLD!!!"
70% short interest as of today ..they still havent covered...unbelievable.
"Current short interest of SPRT is 66.54% of the float and a borrow fee of 102% which is on the highly expensive side and will/could lead to Margin calls. Shorties on here trying to scare you out. If they didn't like the stock, they wouldn't be here unless it's a short seller. I don't like some stocks either and I'm not on there bashing them. It makes no sense and a waste of time unless you are short and under water."
"When price action is this extreme and the FUD is high, THIS IS THE STOCK TO BE IN! Just hold and buy. We are good."
Most people on here know the play but for anyone new…Remember GME earlier this year.Squeeze is in play and I’m holding and buying.
buy pressure = they have to cover with huge cost to borrow and huge losses injected on sprt for us !!
They times of AMC and GME were great …fully acknowledging the unique stories we will be telling our kids / grandchildren …time to move on now…onwards!!!
"Updated Ortex SI (9am est) is now 71.18%, which means there are new shorts since Friday's run (previously thought there was 1-2% less showing 69 but its back up), short squeeze is still in play folks!"
"When you see others pumping other stocks on here it's desperate shorties trying to scare you out of your position. I traded both GME and AMC and they did the same thing on those stocks. Of course we all know who lost on that deal LOL, yes the shorts because people held and added shares to their position.Buy, Hold and watch the Short sellers Fold!"
"Lol, the level 2 is funny.Selling 2-3 shares at a time trying to sink the price. Haha do people actually fall for this?"
It’s gonna be slow n steady like this until Friday full moon 100$
Excellent day … holding strong … building up pressure … toward success !
"VERY IMPORTANT/GREAT ANALYSIS from u/anonfthehfs at r/SPRT:SPRTan's,Hear me now. I need you to pay attention to me. Today is a hyped day. People have been talking about it for a while now and if you don't think the shorts know this, then you don't understand who is on the other side of this trade.Shots don't like losing and they have been doing this for years. They have successfully bankrupted thousands of companies using every trick in the book. Only recently with GameStop did retail traders unearth some of their long standing dirty tricks. In the past, you read a negative article on Motley Fool, MarketWatch, Investors Place, Business Insider, Seeking Alpha, CNBC, etc and you might be swayed to buy or sell something. But what if I told you those media companies get tons of money from the big Institutional Players and Hedge Funds?Is that hard to believe that they would behind the scenes plant information, have a working relationship, maybe provide metrics for journalist that might be a little biased in their favor?So now you are aware that the media that you used to trust could be a little compromised but what should I do? Don't listen to anyone blindly. Start fact checking things for yourself. We are talking about your hard earned money. When you see someone on Reddit with a 2 month old account saying the squeeze is over or #$%$ this stock, I lost my life savings on SPRT , question it. (I know my account age is questionable for those of you wondering. I created this one because my main account had my name in it. I didn't want to be fighting billion dollar hedge funds with my name flying around out there) Question everything.So today is a hyped up day. You know what that means? They are likely going to shake this tree as hard as they can to see what paper hands fall out. We might see breaker halts to the downside like you have never seen before unless you were with GME in Jan/Feb. I'm preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. I hope we run straight up to test the All Time High again but we have to be aware. That means we are doing something right in my experience.This is a dangerous place for them to be. They have FTD's approaching and they can either cover at huge losses or they can fight. Trust me, they will fight. They will probably short during halts (Which is illegal but they do it anyway). They will run up hard then drop the price fast and quick making you doubt the stock.Look for #$%$ery all this week. They need you to sell. They sold more shares than exist. They know we watch Ortex so they will probably married ITM Calls and Puts to lower the reportable Short Interest like they did on GameStop. They will use every trick in the book, to kick the can down the road.But you know their tricks now and they will learn that it is probably cheaper to cover here and now, than it is to try to kick the can down the road. Tomorrow starts the new Margin rules.If I were them, I tank today and eat the FTDs. They want retail to get scared they are wrong and will lose everything. With the new Margin requirements, tomorrow is scary for the littler funds who were short. Today I expect #$%$ery.Stay strong and HODL. You are right.....this is very much in play and if you see huge swings each way, that means we are on the right path. Yesterdays volume was 72 million. Fridays was 166 million. How many shares does this company have again? Does that make sense that the entire float trades multiple times? Last time I saw anything like this was GME in Jan before it ran up. The shorts hit it down hardest before they lost control.Shield Wall up SPRTAN'S - For soon we dine from the riches of our enemy."
59.4% of today's volume was routed to the dark pool. They had to resort to extreme manipulation to keep this down. It's AMC/GME all over again.
its just shorties trying their last card
Short interest is not even down 2% today. That means we are still 73% of float sold short. There has been NO squeeze yet. FOMO only
let's go back to 39 first today...
"Just so everyone knows, this case is ROCK SOLID, 75% shorted, Borrow fee above 300%, FTD ATH, no shares to short. WE WILL GET RICH IF EVERYONE FOLLOWS THE PLAN!"
"Hedges just dropped another 20 million to bring it down. Thats 100 million today to discourage you, and its not working."
Still above $30 even with all they throwing at it.
Buy. Hold. Do not sell. The shorts are playing games and bashing to get you to sell.
"I'd like to dedicate this song to the shorties out there who are about to be fried!""Here's something that you'll never going to forget - You ain't seen nothing yet!""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cia_v4vxfE"
Was that really all they could muster - not even Down to the close after last surge …
We are going to pass $SPRT. Hold and be patient. It’s coming.
"Don't forget a monstrosity of T+35 need to start being covered this week, along with a potential gamma squeeze from new options bought"
"Todays low is higher than yesterdays low, it's holding very strong."
May be $50 at open.
This will REBOUND Don’t listen to Bashers or Shorts  GME did the SAME THING Don’t need to say anything else because we know the PRICE of GME Stock TODAY Stay Strong  Don’t Sell I’m NOT
"Shorts have been bashing this stock for weeks, and in just one month, SPRT is up over 300%!! LMAO!! People that are shorting this are complete m,o. ro-ns!!! ;)"
"Upvote this for exposure to new SPRT holders!!!!SPRT has been ranked by Ortex and Fintel as a top Short Squeeze candidate and is among the most heavily shorted stocks right now. Short % of Float is currently over 70%. Above average volume lately and gaining lot of attention. SPRT has also been on the Threshold Securities list for weeks due to high failure to delivers. Many brokerages like Interactive Brokers have sent out ""Notice of Margin Increase"" for accounts that hold a concentrated postion of SPRT.Also… SPRT is planning to merge with Greenidge Generation Holdings (GREE) this quarter. Greenidge is a bitcoin mining and power generation company providing blockchain services for its on-site cryptocurrency mining operation.Check out r/SPRT on Reddit for some good DD"
"Anyone bashing is short. That is one of the simple jungle rules in this jungle. There are others, but don't ever, ever forget that one."
"Rebounding nicely, inflow currently greater than outflow (no surprises there) these deliberate attacks never last. Price is very artificially suppressed at the moment. I see $40+ today and then reality kicks in tomorrow with new regulations on margins + 3rd of september + FTDs + gamma squeeze by Friday's $50.01. GLTA"
"Just be honest all longs. We vsualized a really fun short destroying day, and we are left wondering if we miscalulated. A little honesty is good for the soul. Not saying the pary is over! Let's just forget about the shorts and worry about our decision making. Rigt now I personally agree I let my family down."
"Glad I kept my shares over the weekend, paid off"
Shorts waking up today and look at Yahoo Finance
I bought my shares at $2.36 so I'm just gonna hold. lol
$80+ on Friday! Get the train moving!
We are ALL OVER THE NEWS!!! CNBC is showing us on screen with AMC and GME. They put out an article talking about how much SPRT is taking off. Bloomberg Businessweek also released article last Friday. One article had very optimistic quote from Igor Duhaniwsky from S3. This movement is just getting started. We’re almost to the point that we can POST ON WALL STREET BETS
Shorts better gear up and cough up some more cash to me. $100! Spoil me shorts! I want some solid gold sunglasses like Elvis had with your money!
"Todays down day means little, it was the lowest volume day by far for the last 8 days. Just a few, very few taking some profits. Read the volume, it tells the story.GOOD LUCK LONGS"
"Upvote for exposure: Anyone experiencing FUD or falling for bashers propaganda please check out the SPRT thread on Redddit for some amazing DD. This stock is looking REEADY to squeeze and the thesis has never been more solid. The drop on Friday is NOTHING to worry about and there will be huge upside from here. The stars are aligning for a SPRT SQUEEEZE!!! The shorts will soon be forced to cover, options in the money, failure to delivers need to be bought, and FOMO is extreme. Media is just picking up SPRT. LOOK at GME chart leading up to January 27th and 28th. The week before had lots of volatility. I believe we are in a similar stage as Jan 22nd to 25th"
Why are there bashers on this stock? Are shorts that desperate? Here's a hint: be the first to switch sides and maybe you can recoup your losses.
here is play ! i stay here ! who with me holding ?
Poor shorts are getting BBQ’d again today…. Have to remember sideways Kills Options Lol up 40+% & holding means anyone who bought puts on Friday is Underwater & drowning today despite what they are trying to sell in this board… This is holding up Beautifully  … just a little longer & I have all the count resets I am waiting on for next leg up. Notice how those $85 Calls are getting loaded?  just enjoy the ride…
"All my predictions today were correct, from it hitting $60 to closing slightly below 30. Monday is the real short squeeze."
"Calls for September 17, 2021There are 2,026 calls for a 40$ strike. There are 2,268 calls for a 60$ strike. There are 4,033 calls for a 85$ strike.I got in at 36,23 and I am going to hold."
Up $7m on the buy:sell ratio and Fidelity reports 1801 buy orders vs 1617 sell orders.
"SPRT profit taking today, hold your SHARES!!!!!!!!!!!!!also, dig into ACRX, the ACRX Yahoo Finance price target = 600% upside! ACRX 2022 huge year ahead...."
Once this closes over 1.5billion in marketcap. The WSB army will start flowing in.
open 50
Only 10days until merger ...IM NOT SELLING A SINGLE SHARE!!
Nobody is selling!
SI now at 74.1%. They are tripling down. This only makes me want to go buy more. Slingshot.
"The short interest is still 71.66%, paper hands who sold during today’s price action had help them recovered 0.97% with only 37% upward price action.If you wanna see that triple digits on the stock price, you need to just buy and hold, you also see how BBIG was just another paper hands trap? Anyway, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday are the big FTD recovering day, we should see another spike.How would the price goes? Up, of course, by how much? It’ depends on how good you can hold the stock."
7th green day in a row.Up over 220% in the past 5 trading days. Heavily shorted Low FloatMerging with a green energy Bit Mining CompanyShorts desperately bashing to scare us out.Do I need to explain any further?
If you understand nobody is selling then why is it down? Hedge funds have deep pockets and will drive it down to a price they like to buy at. They can't manipulate buying and holding. Thats your job if you want a higher stock price.
When you feel the short squeeze forming...
"Honestly, though can someone explain to me how we have 50 million daily volume so far on a stock with 24 million total shares outstanding and a float of 9 million? I mean it literally makes no sense. There must be a TON of naked shorts flying around. There has to be. Where is the SEC? THese numbers are impossible"
"I can’t sleep thinking about SPRT going to unimaginable highs.. ""Gamma squeeze + momentum buying + some short covering = monster rally,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky of S3"
Time to hold now.
How we feeling today guys?
"Short interest are still sky high, around 70%. It has not been covered by the Hedgies. There has been an 230% rise from the 60% short. It can easily reach the $85-$105 mark. My bearish estimate is $75. We definitely need to hold on to all the shares. No time for paper hands. Now we gotta play like whales."
"I got in late on amc a few months ago but am now up, it’s not over if you guys got in yesterday in the $50’s, we will be back very soon."
For those saying the squeezed is over
revenue to valuation multiple went from like 3x to over 30x in the last week. Nvidia trades at 25x and they're not operating at a loss. enjoy the short squeeze!
"This will blow up like a nuclear plant explosion this week! Not sure if you should be on the stock market if you can't comprehend all the sign and data for this case. Rock solid, it will blow even if some paperhands sell to for easy gain."
guy dosen't matter the price !!! you can buy at open this stock is shorted at 73% on 9millions full float they have to cover ! 0 short shares available to run the price down ! 0 risk to buy now !!!
"Nothing as changed. Shorts didn't cover Friday. Still 75% SI. Will be testing new highs today, and onwards of 100$ easily."
That’s what I call a nice dip & bought more…perhaps one of the last opportunities to buy more below $40 
shorties be like
Up 46.45% for the day! Great Job Longs!Short Sellers tomorrow Pre Market....
I am holding my shares but I’m not an experienced trader. Can someone please tell me if today’s activities were a bad thing bc I’m down thousands of $$ so it kinda feels like it. Any advice or thoughts on what to expect tomorrow/this weeks with SPRT? Thanks!
bounced off day's low ~32.50 twice already.see if it can hold at that level...
"Huge buy orders coming in at these levels, I saw 37k and 20k. Someone is loading up. Funny how they can't drag this below 30, we are holding up just fine imho. All the upcoming catalysts will take care of the shorts + we are clearly hodling + more buys than sells. This stock is a no-brainer. GLTA"
All charts show an upward trend next week and the squeeze hasn’t started yet. All signals show the squeeze will happen Sept. 7th & 8th. Do not get discouraged about today’s drop off. Continue to hold and this will surge in the next 2 weeks. Save the dates. We will all be rewarded.
"This isn't just a meme stock, but will be a solid long-term hold after merger."
"Not very worried about low movement for the next week or so. GME did the same thing, it doubled, sat for a week then it went 10x"
60 today?
We are in for an epic ride....
shorts right now are like...
0 shares availbe to short today too.. What are shorts gonna do now
"AH volume: 1,446,196"
The patient are rewarded that’s a fact holding til 104
market cap of only 800m if this is to squeeze to the MC of GME you're looking at 20x and that's just the beginning
"citadel folks have to be laughing at all the paper hands in here.......saying ""stock is heavily shorted, good fundamentals now"" but they still get shook too early."
40 touchdown says 50 coming!!
Looks like possibly another inside day today…. I have my count reset on all but the daily now… will check in again this afternoon. Holding…
"Just look at the price actions.Monday opened at $9.29 while the last closed was $8.77 dropped from $10 last Friday high.Tuesday opened at $11.25 while the last closed was $10.71 dropped from $11.35 Monday high.Wednesday opened at $13.76 while the last closed was $11.66 dropped from $14.48 Tuesday high.Thursday opened at $15.18 while the last closed was $13.98 dropped from $14.83 of Wednesday high.Friday opened at $43.91 while last closed was $19.49 and it was actually the Thursday high.So Friday is essentially the similar price action of the rest of the week except Thursday when we broke critical point of $18 during open, and $30 in after market.Why are they ""critical""? Is because massive numbers of calls had been sold with the strike price expires at 09/17.In the US, a call buyer can exercise their call contracts whenever they like, hence the price action when we broke through $18 during open hour, and call writers were FUDing after they saw $30 in after hour + new people coming in FOMO buying when they heard SPRT had reached $1B market cap.And the short sellers/day traders/ profit taking paper hands sold at around $53 is because that was the ""crazy high"" back when this stock was trading from $3 to $8. But is it actually gonna be the top that we'll never gonna see? It's depends on your own opinions.Personally, if no ""hiding the buy button"" shenanigans are being pulled, this stock could actually became bigger than GME, and even bigger than Volkswagen if the shorts didn't cover and let it squeeze before the merge took place. Right now, we're still seeing 75% of short interest. So no, they're not covering yet."
"Everything according to plan…best stock ever as dormant vs super visible in no time , hence naked shorts caught by surprise … let’s toast them … to Mars "
"I didn’t sell Friday because I don’t believe I needed to or should.The SI prior to Friday was still very high, increased over the week as the price increased. The cost to borrow and utilization is still very high.Throughout the week new option strike price were added. $18 to $23, then $24 to $30, the $31 to $39. The price increased so quickly that these options didn’t have the open interest and volume they would normally have in this situation. Many of these were already in the money before you could even purchase them at market open. The price quickly surpassed the highest strike and there weren’t any additional call options to help further push the price up. I believe we stalled out at $59 because of this which gave shorts the opportunity to short more shares. Noticeably there was also a significant increase in volume and open interest of puts primarily from $3.50 to $15.00.Buying a put could essentially offset the price run up and stall out. Bulls had no choice but to buy deep in the money calls at high premiums which most probably weren’t doing. I believe shorts bought a lot of puts to send the price down.If you don’t understand this concept, a quick summary, when you buy a call or put option the market maker hedges that call to remain in a low risk neutral position. The option gives you the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a specific strike price. If you were to have bought a $24 call for 9/17 yesterday, I believe when the share price was around the $40 to $60 range that call was somewhere between 60 and 90 percent hedged, meaning at 60 percent the market maker had 60 shares on hand if the call were to be exercised. With a put the market maker would essentially sell shares they had on hand based on their hedging. So enough out buys could drive the share price back down.I checked Fidelity and it appears there are going to be strike prices up to $85 opened for options Monday at market open which is bullish in my opinion and will hopefully help the share price drive past $60!"
"FACT no one is elling, only shorting. Proud of the longs here. Just wait. These early am shares shorted, will be covered from 3-6 pm today. Wait, watch and learn."
"10k shares in this, this will go to the moon. The next big meme stock"
Looking for green within the hour.
"If this hit $60 without a squeeze, what will it hit when shorts cover?"
"I PREDICTED IT FRIDAY  $SPRT“Listen up. Same thing happened last friday too. Today it tested new high (60$) rejected, tries again, then rejected again, then dips until EOD. Afterhours rips up nicely, and oscillates 2-3$ up and down. 4am-5am Monday, it spikes up! Trades sideways, opens at 40$+, gets rejected, dips a 10-15% and THEN will slowly retest 60$ again. Maybe we will get 65$ this time. I look forward to see you all buy back in ;)”"
buying OMER as the next big short squeeze victim. Chart is suggesting a big move up to over 32. News coming. Going to help it along and make some money in the next 7 days
So cute playing ping pong with shares back and fourth. Lol. Just buy and hold. Remove stop losses.
"Look at gme January 22/25thThe closing daily high and open. On the Friday it had a open of $42, high of 75 and closed at $42Opened the Monday at 95 with a high of 153. 2 days later the stock was at $350SPRT has a float of 9 million shares, 70% are short AND 9 million calls are ITM! Boom boom boom. Lots of day traders piled in today and made some great cash. This play is no where near being over yet"
Today for the first time in a week or so we goin to end in red but don’t worry

Bag holders of AMC & GME are everywhere begging for folks to buy in and relieve them of their painAMC & GME are so yesterday. they don't have the volume anymore.

"Trust me, I predicted this on Friday, when it open 40+ like i said, it will dip a 10-15%… and afterwards, we will retest 60$ again "
Holding 6000 shares at $8
They are fighting for it to NOT go over 40. Keep putting on buying pressure. Higher highs. Higher lows. Buy and HOLD. Simple
Making money in the stock market is surprisingly simple..just do the opposite of bywon.
Extreme price changes. Lots of FUD. This is the stock! Hold and buy at these prices!
Stock is down 14% from yesterday but options premium are still very expensive so someone really knows something that we don’t. I am still holding my shares with Loss
Cost to borrow is like 330%  shorts are in it deep. HOLD!
"People pushing other ""New Runners"" are just trying to get your eye's off this. dont be tempted...stay strong"
buy now you will not regret it. I have 5000 shares now
FTD's tomorrow through Friday -- and MM's ahve already done all they can with the stock price by purchasing options today. $100 is the floor.
When the market is red only memes blast will see if how hedgies gonna play today !!!
Geez. Last 5 days this went from 11 to 14 to 20 to 26 to 36…. And it’s down 8% today . Woopee. Seriously. This squeeze IS STILL ON BIGTIME. Don’t beFooled and spoiled.
"When FUD is sure of success … then it is going to explode… remember GameStop? Same, same, BUT facts and data of SPRT are superior…"
Merging with mining company. Only has 26 million share in the market%75 short interest Come on let’s destroy The Who is shorting 
yahoo cancel my comment for ortex numbers short interst is up 6.81 % now 74.14 % short interest
Let’s post thoughts and keep conversation on Support … if you want to talk about other stocks GO to their message boards …. thank you?!
Look at the data: success is imminent… what does it mean…well: >$150…do your own research aka DD…no brainer 
will this get to 70 tomorrow? Or 60?
"The makings of a rare killer perfect storm are all here if you simply hold. The seething short anger, venom and ire are simply the confirming icing. Simply buy, hold and ride the elevator....easy money. 67%+ short float is pure hoggy take-down greed."
$50 possible? Lets do a $SPRT
Options chain expanded all the way to $85!!!
"This community is amazing. I am holding strong, buying more shares."
"It’s still 2 dollars higher than yesterday’s bear raid of 29.70. Graph it. If yesterday matches today, this should be our bottom."
"This is looking good. Tons of support. And here's a shout out to our friends in Germany, Korea, and elsewhere. Buy more and steadily, even if it's only small amounts. Or just HODL. The shorts and hedge funds will collapse. It will be EPIC."
Doubling down...Just added 1000 shares at $36. Let's squeeze the shorts.
That CNBC segment was a good look for SPRTNow lets get ready for POWER HOUR!!
Robinhood shows contracts till 85 now !!!! I am not worried new high coming next week!!!
"We're gonna end up at 80% SI at this rate! Inflow still larger than outflow, money pouring into this. Shorts are in full on panic mode, FTDs from Friday could start ticking in at any second now. Tic-toc"
Buying pressure coming in!!
"Careful for this setup premarket, if it doesn't go over 40 today it looks like a large selloff. If you are opening a position make sure its small. For those under 15$ cost basis possibly a good hold. GL Longs!"
Its obvious what they doing. Stay strong or fold if you scared.
The BIG SQUEEZE is a process. The price won't go straight to 300 or 400 or 900. We are near the end of the first stage of the BIG SQUEEZE (the floor). Don't worry about the shorts because they will help the price increase because they will be caught in a loop trying breakeven.
HODL guys and galsPressure is mountingWhen the merger happens there’s a $60 price target just based off fundamentals. We are potentially free rolling a squeeze here.They wont just give it to us.Block out the FUD and know you are part of the MOASS !!
This stock is getting lots of press. Not sure shorts will be able to control the price when SPRT is talked about on most financial channels. David vs Goliath!
Just brought 1115 shares at 30.92
this one will open much higher ! the best play !
"If your average is higher, Now is the time to average down peopleBuy And Hold!"
Short float 73% now  http://radikal.ru/fp/q825zru2yin2g
When they vote for merger September 10 they will be forced to cover at some point.
Pre market load up .$45 opener.
you know what they doing. they watching this board for investors sentiment. They pounce a billion to drive it down so they can buy at the price they want. You don't have the guts to challenge them. They win again because you folded under pressure.
The bears are losing control. They're having less and less influence. This thing is finna explode!
"Short attack his having a minimal effect, given the SI level is now over 74%"
"If you thought there was a short squeeze this morning on this stock, just wait. Who do you think is selling those huge blocks at the market in the last hour of trading? Market makers. They have the ability to sell even if there are no shares to borrow!"
I’ve been loading up all day on SPRT. Enjoying this artificial dip created by hedgies and shorts to create a sell off… NICE TRY GUYS… is that the best you’ve got???
"Money is pouring in right now, we went from $6m to a current $9m up on the buy ratio. Everyone is buying the dip, lesson learned from AMC/GME."
I am still up 300% for month great win spartans...we gave about 100% from today price since fridays its ok i can give change to get another 400-500% to this shorties & Hedgies
Bought 100 shares at 37.50....will sell today at huge profit. Thank you.
Coming back up. Feel sorry for paper hands that sold.
Bought 100 more.
search r/sprt to stay informed. Yes that's reddit.
They halted Friday’s close - false print at $26. To the moon. 
Hedgies run out of time ️ and stock to cover…never seen that before!!This will be epic —> $300
$75 tomorrow pre market then $100+ get on board and smack the ASK people! This is still 72% short and virtually nobody covered yet!
"“FOMOS” are gonna get in tomorrow, which will push this higher…the hard part will be to resist the temptation to sell… this is way more than a “meme” stock…"
"2 days in a row I got in at a great price. 30 on Monday , 31 and change today. Sit and hold guys."
Tomorrow $50+
Here is what I suspect on the short squeeze to 900.00 in the making but probably won't be tomorrow. We should see 100 tomorrow and squeeze to 900 within the next three weeks. Most big squeeze take a few days.
now some cover ! returned shares not borrowed ! that up the coast to borrow ! good for us !
"Ihor Dusaniwsky from S3 Partners (the company Will Mead has referenced, subscription costs $9K a year) was interviewed yesterday concerned our boy SPRT. Some hopium quotes from the interview:“Shares shorted were climbing earlier in the month, but we have seen short covering recently as the shorts are in the middle of a big squeeze,"" says Ihor Dusaniwsky of S3 Partners, adding, ""The squeeze will continue and accelerate.""""This rally is a long buying rally in a stock with a thinly traded float (20 million shares) and tremendous long buying pressure,"" Dusaniwsky said. 'Gamma squeeze + momentum buying + some short covering = monster rally,"" said Dusaniwsky.Link to Interview with Yahoo FinanceConcerning yesterday’s drop EOD, RSI in SPRT remained above 60 on the 4h chart. That is typically a bullish signal.What is RSI?Why is staying above 60 bullish?From the same Fidelity Article:In an uptrend or bull market, the RSI tends to remain in the 40 to 90 range with the 40-50 zone acting as support. During a downtrend or bear market the RSI tends to stay between the 10 to 60 range with the 50-60 zone acting as resistance. These ranges will vary depending on the RSI settings and the strength of the security’s or market’s underlying trendYou may remember GMEs first run up had a big drop on January 25th. Illustrated here. A 61.06% drop intraday, however RSI remained above 60.Now let’s look at SPRT yesterday here a 55.51% drop. RSI remained above 60.GMEs performance does not dictate what SPRT will do, but it highlights how things may not be what they seem, and we must look deeper than just the price of the stock. There are fundamental indicators that point to a reversal to the upside (off the EOD drop) next week."
When you see the short squeeze forming...
reddit is ready to load this one up after $sprt and $bbig
Thursday/Fridayhit $150 and flying to $500. Looks amazing with all data.Best stock for 2021.Mark this post
"The FTD shares has be covered BEFORE MARKET CLOSE, so expect this sideway action during open time."
Just bought 1k shares. Came over from $SPRT. I'll hold both stocks into max squeeze points as best I can determine. It is possible to do two things at once! GLTA
"Short Interest in SPRT dropped to 60% as of today. THIS IS A GREAT EVENT as it means shorts are getting scared. Remember, there are MANY Short Squeezes that start out with a 20-30% SI, so we're far from being over. If you look at the peaks that are resistance, slowly and slowly we're building a wedge where there won't be peaks anymore, just SOLID GROWTH until just before the day where SHORTS WILL COVER their positions because they have a meter half day to cover!!!! $69.69, Here we come!!!"
60 percent shorted. Would be scared if the short squeeze didn’t work on game stop. And we’ll it yes oh yes 4000% returns
Only professionals understand that this is the BEST stock of the years for the last 20 years.Tesla will be mining with these guys on the merger.A smart person will hold on any price. Below 40 buy with all of your power.No mistakes here.35 years of experience. This is the time to get real reach for all of us.
"Short sellers are digging themselves a deeper hole everyday with this stock, the more they dig, the more money that the long term investors who stick around will earn eventually."
"Data shows that shorts have 5.5 million shares that they have to cover, lol! "
Israel is IN5 friends. 1.2M shares Good luck longs. This is an amazing stock. Will reach $100 this week
Tomorrow I can finally afford to pay for my mom chemotherapy thanks SPRT God Bless 
People just taking some profits from yesterday‘s game it’ll all come back..
PM already @ 1.7 million ️
I just dont understand day traders. They sold today at 35 and they will be buying back in monday at 36.
Shorts buying and selling to each other AH is hilarious

Most exciting stock ever!!Any predictions for next week & when the short squeeze will start?I would say: next week Monday we will re-rest $60 and close around d $80. Tuesday and Wednesday then the squeeze to > $150 …What do you think??
Nobody is selling! They manipulating your mind. Sell if you intimidated and scared.

My next resistance area is up around $104. … if we force a major short squeeze… it is my opinion that can be a very Conservative target… this has some serious run potential if shares get locked up (HOLD) so they are forced to pay Major Premiums to make it worth our while to sell anything.
"""Shorts decided to borrow more on their FTD's, it's a risky strategy let's see if it pays off for them"""
"Estimated short interest is up almost 9% already today  wow lol they are fighting hard to keep the price down. HOLD THE LINE, SPRTans!!!"
hold team short interest is up some shares are returned cost to borrow is up ! hold is very important at this level !
Richard is absolutely correct. They tried hard to discourage you. Stay strong.
Bought at $50- not worried one bit. Im not selling unless the shorts cover it at triple digits. The short interest is still high at 70%. GL shorts.
"Did the maths to correlate GMEs highs in January with factor 0.4…result:Today $58Tuesday $146Wednesday $186BUT: numbers / fundamentals @ SPRT are more favorable, hence $300 is feasible…To the Moon, then Mars, followed by Pluto"
Bull flag confirmed. 80$ incoming
Bought at 30. Thank you waited all day! Long and strong
Graphs are looking very bullish!! Buy em up... Cup and handle formed and should break out!
This is overvalued to the hilt but so is AMC and GME. When the demand-supply curve goes out of whack like this - you can throw logic out of the window. I won't be surprised if this hits triple digits in the near future....just because it can. I will be trading in and out though. All the best...
"The daily chart is looking promising, and as far as I know the shorts still didn't cover. "
60-70 tomorrow ??
might end in the green now.
All you got to do in the Stock Market to make money is be PATIENT.
We need more volume!!
This is a very strong group. Amazing!!

THAT WAS THE BEST SHORTS COULD DO!!LMAOOOOOOOOO!!!
"This is what's gonna be like after merger is done if the shorts did not cover, the insiders would hold not just 92%, but 94.2% (plus the insiders from SPRT) while the float stays the same and short interest of the float stays the same.And it'll be Volkswagen 2021"
"Article says no shares available to short at SPRT. With so few shares in existence this is a powderkeg...GME 56M float, 17% short, $209AMC 511M float, 18% short, $43SPRT 9.31M float, 67% short, $36"

THIS is the best you shorts can do during a red market day? THIS!??SPRT UP FROM $9 LAST MONDAY!!LMAOOOO!! #ShortSQUEEEEEZE
"Short sellers must cover super  …it is only a question of minutes, hours or 2 days …then:"
Took the opportunity to average down.I remember all the doubters over GME.
"I'll just keep saying this all day. ... Hold. Buy if you can, even small amounts. That is all we need to do."
When shorts start commenting other stocks...you know they're in trouble hereand in the stocks they keep mentioning...LMAOOOOOOO!!!BUY SPRT AND HOLD.....its really that simple.
Check the reaction count of every user that just bashed SPRT...fake accounts talking to each other LMAOOOOOOO
Germany Halted SPRT... This never happens in Germany Market never..Last time they halted was GME...We going to moon!!!
"Shorts covering, having to buy our shares at the going rate which could 100X. Remarkable and historical one-time event for me. Very nice indeed."
I am adding tomorrow morning !!!
ARE YOU NOT CONVINCED LONGS KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT???!!! This was almost at 30 an hour ago....over shorted scared short play. Be long and very brave strong. You will make a HUGE chunk on this one.
Also something to keep in mind… this has a higher Short % than both GME and AMC now… SPRT is where you want to be if you missed the GME short squeeze… $104 is All Time High…. Once that has been passed Sky is the limit… no resistance…. A little can go a long way. I do not encourage anyone to put their life savings in anything. I do believe this has the potential to make whatever you can afford to buy go much much higher though… This Party is just getting warmed up imo. This dip is a necessary juncture to board the train…. There is always some risk though so be wise.
As long as we close higher everyday we will Rock...Dont panic on dips..I just bought more at 29.90...Yee mee...
"Notice shill comments increasing on this board, they scared. Gotta take cover soon, get your helmets on and get on the short bus shorties"

Can you all STOP selling please. Don't understand why anyone would be selling now. Just STOP IT.
"Listen up. Same thing happened last friday too. Today it tested new high (60$) rejected, tries again, then rejected again, then dips until EOD. Afterhours rips up nicely, and oscillates 2-3$ up and down. 4am-5am Monday, it spikes up! Trades sideways, opens at 40$+, gets rejected, dips a 10-15% and THEN will slowly retest 60$ again.

Read everything thing you can read about top ten short squeezes. Shorts will be in denial if they read it which is to our benefit. Tomorrow will be very special. Get ready for a long ride upward.
The reaper is coming for all who shorted this.U will pay the ultimate price.
A lot of people took there profits last Friday and will put an amount of it back in this stock. because nothing has changed. The squeeze is still going on. So this is a great level to step in (again).
AH on the rise 
"Anyone on here bashing sprt and trying to scare you into selling is obviously a short. If not holding a long position, why else would anyone be here wasting their time? I don’t go to other boards of stocks I don’t like and waste time there bashing them. Think. Be smart. I have a long position and have no intention of selling in the short term. Think about it - 70% short interest and only 9 million float. If we hold and continue to buy the shorts will be buried and have no choice but to panic buy and drive this way up. BE SMART! GL!"
it just end of month selling. over 100 soon.
"I made a $10,000 deposit strictly for this I don't care what the price is once my money is in my account ready for trading what should take 2 to 3 days I am putting it all in this would multiply my current position by three"
"Shills and FUD is at ATH for the weekend, BUT dont fall for their lies, don't let them get to you. FACT is that this is still Wall Streets most reported shorted stock, the fundamentals has not changed at all. In fact I believe the case is even more solid after Fridays wild ride, a lot of naked shorting was going on. The shorters and shills are few in number, we on the WINNING side are more and stronger. Remember and look at the fundamentals, SI% extremely high, the Fails-To-Deliver is high, the borrow fee is high and there IS NO MORE SHARES TO SHORT. Stick to the plan and this will skyrocket during next week, you don't want to miss this rocket! The people with the greatest conviction is making the most money on the stock market. Paperhands and daytraders get some easy gains BUT NOT WEALTH which is what we are aiming for. STAY STRONG #SPRTans target price is 300 usd!"
"For a short squeeze to happen, people cant keep scalping for 30 cent profits.Just thought id point that out lol"
sprt not done. to many shorts expect back to 6 area. still short squeeze possible. if shorts don't sell. than if this goes to a 100. thr margin calls will be hugh for shorts.this thing not like it gone up 300 percent in one day and done. any starting to act like sprt. how it gaps up and back down.
"APES keep in mind - the play is not about today! The play is through next week! New shorting rules go into effect on the 1st, and there are some mega FTDs coming due! HODL!!"
it will go right back up and close close 40.00...No panic and hold..
Thanks for letting me in
50 million volume its not over and it was never over!!!
"Adding 2.3M shares at opening.We are 5 people from Israel investing total of 3.5M shares.First amazing situation after GME. Can reach $500 this week with the squeeze.Be strong and Hold. If you want to sell, sell half leave half to run. This is the best way to make the most."
6 million FTDs due Tomorrow.!Not worried!
Oh my lordy this thing is going to pluto. I would be having bad thoughts if I was short and realizing I might need to sell my house soon!

open 50 and we fly for short squeeze i'm in 80k eur at friday close ! so happy !
Up 10 percent in germany
So glad I averaged up at 30$!! Taking candy from a baby. Shorts are playing with fire here lol. FTDs today.. Google FTDs if you're in the dark here... Easy money
not worried at all.. hold the line
My friend says SPRT is bigger than Google and Facebook.
Can we see $50× today!
"The squeeze is imminent . it is only a matter of time until this pops up like a bottle of champagne. It is very simple to understand the situation. 74% floats (SI)3 out of 4 shares are shortshort has to cover means either buy the actual stock or loose the positions back to the market in a very high rate, up to 400 % buying it back"
SPRT Has double the potential of GameStop and GameStop hit a 52 week high of $483pps. Do the math and you get $986 PPS
Absolutely great. Thanks all that bought and held.The day of reckoning is coming for u know who.
"Correct me if I’m wrong please because I have only been doing this for 8 months but I see that $bbig has the same pattern and same volumes from when it was around the $3 to $4 range same as $sprt when it was in that price range too and When it gets in the $5M to $7M volume it shoots up by $2 to $3 again just as $sprt did. And suddenly when $sprt started getting volumes in the $50M to $80M that’s when it really took off so I’m just wondering when some say this can potentially go to $20 a share are they undervaluing it and it actually could take off the $40s or maybe $50s if it keeps the same momentum as $sprt? Again, I’m just new and trying to learn what to look for in a position once I’m I in itI’m holding both and so far I’m doing pretty good and planing on holding both based on positive info from these platforms"
short interest is up 8.64% now and short interest 75.45%
"SI now at 73.48, up about 4% from open. LOL clearly that dip was a short attack"
Kind of funny how CNBC mentions this stock everyday now
"""The way to get rich, is to hold."" - Warren Buffet. In other words, my friends, if you bought over today's closing price, you haven't lost anything if you haven't sold. The SPRT squeeze is far, far from over. Our day may be next week...or next month. It's going to happen! So don't beat yourself up and certainly don't lose sleep over it! You still have your shares, and we're all right there with you! For those that sold for a loss...well...good lesson learned. Next time you'll hold. Have a great, fun weekend everyone!! Monday will be here sooner than you know! And I promise you...it's gonna be a good one!! TO MARS BABY!!! "
"When you buy at 30 it is still an great, fair and correct price . Check the fundamentals. The merge... And the squeeze will help you to get really rich. Good luck!"
This is like pulling back the string of a bow. I can’t wait to see this thing pop and ride that arrow to glory!
Watching this battle is better then a Netflix series!! Keep buying we will win!!

Anyone buying pre-market or waiting to see what happens at open?
This stock has a very large short position against it stillI know it traded 5 times the total shares outstandingBut some hedge funds probably added to there short positionThat will suffer next week
"SPRT hasn’t squeezed yet, short interest is still at 74% today"
I think what makes it more interesting is the high short interest and low float compared to other Meme stocks. Nothing is for certain but this stock has high potential for a squeeze. IMO
Remove stop losses so they don't get your shares. And if you can put your buy orders straight to lit exchanges. If not they go to the dark pools and your buy won't reflect the price.
I purchased 200 shares @ $51.23 Am I a Bag holder like the many of you? snickering...

Someone mentioned something earlier about buying another share every time we see Byron post (same repetitive drivel over & over Lol) I think he is helping as he just keeps posting Lol … good thing this isn’t a drinking game or we would need rehab by now Oh & he bought puts on Friday… he claims he shorted from $50 … he is most likely underwater in his puts already too… a 40% pop today and then a sideways burn all day from there…. Options have 2 elements… price and Time…. The longer it takes for him to reach his strike (which he conveniently doesn’t mention) the faster he goes under…. He sent the smell of Desperation in his repetitive drivel. So just mute him if makes u concerned. Lol
Demonstrated huge strength today. Going to run all night and open over $40 tomorrow
Whatever price it’ll close today it’ll go up tomorrow pre market by 10$ just like it’s been for the past week
Will be amazing squeeze from 9.00 to 900.00. I'll be telling my great grandchildren about this one.
This is the next squeeze play for sure.

This is what we are looking at without all the hedge fund propaganda1. Short interest still roughly 70%2 float of 9 million shares3. Increasing public interest and interest4. Hit 59 on Friday 5. New short selling ftd and other stuff from sec and finra6. Options in the money for sept 17th are to high and that is only at 25 bucks. SPRT holding 50 at 4:01 on sept 17 will rival the number of synthetic shares citadel has to get out of the market for amc7. A merger that forces everything to be above board. No synthetics going to happen for this on with 2 publically held companies merging.Please continue the list with real reasons this is going to go
Looking good.
"Going to be an exciting week. Look at Fridays volume.. The short interest is still sky high, they still haven't covered! This will be 80$+ this week."
Short interest 66% so shorts haven't covered.

"I didn?t write this but ?anonthehfs? on Reddit. SPRTan's,Hear me now. I need you to pay attention to me. Today is a hyped day. People have been talking about it for a while now and if you don't think the shorts know this, then you don't understand who is on the other side of this trade.Shots don't like losing and they have been doing this for years. They have successfully bankrupted thousands of companies using every trick in the book. Only recently with GameStop did retail traders unearth some of their long standing dirty tricks. In the past, you read a negative article on Motley Fool, MarketWatch, Investors Place, Business Insider, Seeking Alpha, CNBC, etc and you might be swayed to buy or sell something. But what if I told you those media companies get tons of money from the big Institutional Players and Hedge Funds?Is that hard to believe that they would behind the scenes plant information, have a working relationship, maybe provide metrics for journalist that might be a little biased in their favor?So now you are aware that the media that you used to trust could be a little compromised but what should I do? Don't listen to anyone blindly. Start fact checking things for yourself. We are talking about your hard earned money. When you see someone on Reddit with a 2 month old account saying the squeeze is over or #$%$ this stock, I lost my life savings on SPRT , question it. (I know my account age is questionable for those of you wondering. I created this one because my main account had my name in it. I didn't want to be fighting billion dollar hedge funds with my name flying around out there) Question everything.So today is a hyped up day. You know what that means? They are likely going to shake this tree as hard as they can to see what paper hands fall out. We might see breaker halts to the downside like you have never seen before unless you were with GME in Jan/Feb. I'm preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. I hope we run straight up to test the All Time High again but we have to be aware. That means we are doing something right in my experience.This is a dangerous place for them to be. They have FTD's approaching and they can either cover at huge losses or they can fight. Trust me, they will fight. They will probably short during halts (Which is illegal but they do it anyway). They will run up hard then drop the price fast and quick making you doubt the stock.Look for #$%$ery all this week. They need you to sell. They sold more shares than exist. They know we watch Ortex so they will probably married ITM Calls and Puts to lower the reportable Short Interest like they did on GameStop. They will use every trick in the book, to kick the can down the road.But you know their tricks now and they will learn that it is probably cheaper to cover here and now, than it is to try to kick the can down the road. Tomorrow starts the new Margin rules.If I were them, I tank today and eat the FTDs. They want retail to get scared they are wrong and will lose everything. With the new Margin requirements, tomorrow is scary for the littler funds who were short. Today I expect #$%$ery.Stay strong and HODL. You are right.....this is very much in play and if you see huge swings each way, that means we are on the right path. Yesterdays volume was 72 million. Fridays was 166 million. How many shares does this company have again? Does that make sense that the entire float trades multiple times? Last time I saw anything like this was GME in Jan before it ran up. The shorts hit it down hardest before they lost control.Shield Wall up SPRTAN'S - For soon we dine from the riches of our enemy."
Shorts are INCREASING LMAO -- 72.36 SI with 6.74 million shares on loan (plus synthetics...).
"I ve never seen a stock with that much potential. the FTD which is another name for shorts (with a t+6 to settle) , the shorts and the writer of calls make the perfect ix for this stock to shoot way WAY higher"
160 million shares traded on Friday I wonder whether 6 million short shares were covered and now its all just retail fluff trading
"one thing i don't understand open market the short interest up to 75% and the price go down, logic ! after they 571k borrowed shares and returned 880k shares and the price continue to go down with very high coast to borrow, not logic ! sintetic shares ? returned and borrowed and immediatly shorted again but not reported ?"
Can’t wait for the FTD data tmrw!!
Don't sell. $SPRT is literally following.
Shorts better buy lots of Vaseline at the Walmart. This is gonna go up another two or three bucks after hours..
Shorts placed put option to pressure price. Hold strong and buy more when it dips.
Holding to $100
SPRT on CNBC right now!
"SPRT (profit taking expected, buy the dip) & ACRX my top 2 buys. Yahoo Finance PT on ACRX = 600% upside!"
"SI -66.73, Short squeeze score -97.40% according toFintel. Buy more next week and lets take this to Pluto "
So why is this stock rallying over the past few weeks? News anyone? The compnay has said nothing. Whats happening? I own some shares..
"Think about it, SPRT has 4x the short interest of AMC and almost as much visibility now."
"Another excellent day. We had a big dip which is expected from such a huge run but still closed over 39% up for the day LOL. Nice try shorties! Have a great weekend and hold. SPRT hasn’t squeezed yet, short interest is still at a whopping 74%"
"SPRT *hold* your shares, some profit taking!!! also, ACRX add to watch list, look at the ACRX 5-Day Chart; ACRX Yahoo Finance PT = 590% upside... Again, hold your SPRT shares!!!!!"
"Charles Schwab is now soliciting their customers to lend out their $SPRT shares, they're real desperate now. Bullish af"
"Welcome to the brother/sisterhood SPRT! The big 3 of Ape Hodlers! GME, AMC, and now SPRT. Let's buy and hold strong! Peace."
I made a billian dolers today on this stock and am buying a yacht
Hold the line brothers!
