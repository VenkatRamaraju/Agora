"after todays trading ortex data shows 7,48mil shares short... we got a gold mine here guys... shuld run much higher than 100$"
This is overvalued to the hilt but so is AMC and GME. When the demand-supply curve goes out of whack like this - you can throw logic out of the window. I won't be surprised if this hits triple digits in the near future....just because it can. I will be trading in and out though. All the best...
"Check the short ladder going wild at these levels in your trading app, the algo is going absolutely wild. The desperation is through the roof! This is going nowhere but up in the coming days. September 1st & 3rd will add to what could be the perfect storm."
Hedgies run out of time ️ and stock to cover…never seen that before!!This will be epic —> $300
"If you need a sign to buy, this just jumped 12% off the basement which was 30 minutes ago. This stock is solid."
Great work everyone! ---Up over 38%. ---7th green day in a row. ---Up 222% in the past 5 trading days. ---62 shills muted
This is what we are looking at without all the hedge fund propaganda1. Short interest still roughly 70%2 float of 9 million shares3. Increasing public interest and interest4. Hit 59 on Friday 5. New short selling ftd and other stuff from sec and finra6. Options in the money for sept 17th are to high and that is only at 25 bucks. SPRT holding 50 at 4:01 on sept 17 will rival the number of synthetic shares citadel has to get out of the market for amc7. A merger that forces everything to be above board. No synthetics going to happen for this on with 2 publically held companies merging.Please continue the list with real reasons this is going to go
0 shares availbe to short today too.. What are shorts gonna do now
Whatever price it’ll close today it’ll go up tomorrow pre market by 10$ just like it’s been for the past week
"Double green. $100+ later this week. Hands down, the most epic short squeeze candidates are ones with a very small float + company with lots of cash compared to losses like this one and no danger of going BK + arrogant/confident shorts who keep adding, only to get creamed + new all time highs squeezes them so bad they lose like 500% to 1,000% of their original ""investment"" LOL. The higher it goes, the more shorts add = The higher it'll keep going. Vicious self sustaining positive feedback loop."
Doubling down...Just added 1000 shares at $36. Let's squeeze the shorts.
"I didn’t sell Friday because I don’t believe I needed to or should.The SI prior to Friday was still very high, increased over the week as the price increased. The cost to borrow and utilization is still very high.Throughout the week new option strike price were added. $18 to $23, then $24 to $30, the $31 to $39. The price increased so quickly that these options didn’t have the open interest and volume they would normally have in this situation. Many of these were already in the money before you could even purchase them at market open. The price quickly surpassed the highest strike and there weren’t any additional call options to help further push the price up. I believe we stalled out at $59 because of this which gave shorts the opportunity to short more shares. Noticeably there was also a significant increase in volume and open interest of puts primarily from $3.50 to $15.00.Buying a put could essentially offset the price run up and stall out. Bulls had no choice but to buy deep in the money calls at high premiums which most probably weren’t doing. I believe shorts bought a lot of puts to send the price down.If you don’t understand this concept, a quick summary, when you buy a call or put option the market maker hedges that call to remain in a low risk neutral position. The option gives you the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a specific strike price. If you were to have bought a $24 call for 9/17 yesterday, I believe when the share price was around the $40 to $60 range that call was somewhere between 60 and 90 percent hedged, meaning at 60 percent the market maker had 60 shares on hand if the call were to be exercised. With a put the market maker would essentially sell shares they had on hand based on their hedging. So enough out buys could drive the share price back down.I checked Fidelity and it appears there are going to be strike prices up to $85 opened for options Monday at market open which is bullish in my opinion and will hopefully help the share price drive past $60!"
"Did the maths to correlate GMEs highs in January with factor 0.4…result:Today $58Tuesday $146Wednesday $186BUT: numbers / fundamentals @ SPRT are more favorable, hence $300 is feasible…To the Moon, then Mars, followed by Pluto"
They are fighting for it to NOT go over 40. Keep putting on buying pressure. Higher highs. Higher lows. Buy and HOLD. Simple
Absolutely great. Thanks all that bought and held.The day of reckoning is coming for u know who.
Poor shorts are getting BBQ’d again today…. Have to remember sideways Kills Options Lol up 40+% & holding means anyone who bought puts on Friday is Underwater & drowning today despite what they are trying to sell in this board… This is holding up Beautifully  … just a little longer & I have all the count resets I am waiting on for next leg up. Notice how those $85 Calls are getting loaded?  just enjoy the ride…
We are in for an epic ride....
Can’t sleep - thinking about breaking $60 tomorrow in PM thanks to WSJ explicitly stating buy
"this will close over 50 tomorrow, get in asap"
The families of SPRT shorts are facing a life-time financial catastrophe.Current short interest: 72.36%Current free float on loan: 60.52%Current shares on loan: 5.63mDays to cover (on loan): 0.44Cost to borrow: 146.13%Utilization: 95.62
All you got to do in the Stock Market to make money is be PATIENT.
"Clearly, there is a concerted effort to keep the SP under $42… Shorts know exactly what time it is and they know that if it crosses that mark that this stock is going to $50+ in a hurry! "
Demonstrated huge strength today. Going to run all night and open over $40 tomorrow
FTD's tomorrow through Friday -- and MM's ahve already done all they can with the stock price by purchasing options today. $100 is the floor.
I made a billian dolers today on this stock and am buying a yacht
"Just so everyone knows, this case is ROCK SOLID, 75% shorted, Borrow fee above 300%, FTD ATH, no shares to short. WE WILL GET RICH IF EVERYONE FOLLOWS THE PLAN!"
"I have studied this stock and it will fly because of the pressure of the limited float, short position and demand....Going to the moon"
"I'm fueling this rocket pre market. Let's do this, we can make it happen."
"LIKE I SAID, google FTDs if you don't know what they are.They were starting to be handed out AH today getting ready for tomorrow. We will open over 50$ tomorrow. This is like taking candy from a baby..I'd be extremely worried tonight if I was short here. Lmao"
shorts right now are like...
Tomorrow will be the day of glory i think!!!
Pre market load up .$45 opener.
My next resistance area is up around $104. … if we force a major short squeeze… it is my opinion that can be a very Conservative target… this has some serious run potential if shares get locked up (HOLD) so they are forced to pay Major Premiums to make it worth our while to sell anything.
Stock be flying after hours. Don't take my words; watch the action.
Also something to keep in mind… this has a higher Short % than both GME and AMC now… SPRT is where you want to be if you missed the GME short squeeze… $104 is All Time High…. Once that has been passed Sky is the limit… no resistance…. A little can go a long way. I do not encourage anyone to put their life savings in anything. I do believe this has the potential to make whatever you can afford to buy go much much higher though… This Party is just getting warmed up imo. This dip is a necessary juncture to board the train…. There is always some risk though so be wise.
Shorts waking up today and look at Yahoo Finance
"Current short interest of SPRT is 66.54% of the float and a borrow fee of 102% which is on the highly expensive side and will/could lead to Margin calls. Shorties on here trying to scare you out. If they didn't like the stock, they wouldn't be here unless it's a short seller. I don't like some stocks either and I'm not on there bashing them. It makes no sense and a waste of time unless you are short and under water."
"Data shows that shorts have 5.5 million shares that they have to cover, lol! "
"Anyone on here bashing sprt and trying to scare you into selling is obviously a short. If not holding a long position, why else would anyone be here wasting their time? I don’t go to other boards of stocks I don’t like and waste time there bashing them. Think. Be smart. I have a long position and have no intention of selling in the short term. Think about it - 70% short interest and only 9 million float. If we hold and continue to buy the shorts will be buried and have no choice but to panic buy and drive this way up. BE SMART! GL!"
"The short interest is still 71.66%, paper hands who sold during today’s price action had help them recovered 0.97% with only 37% upward price action.If you wanna see that triple digits on the stock price, you need to just buy and hold, you also see how BBIG was just another paper hands trap? Anyway, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday are the big FTD recovering day, we should see another spike.How would the price goes? Up, of course, by how much? It’ depends on how good you can hold the stock."
"Anyone bashing is short. That is one of the simple jungle rules in this jungle. There are others, but don't ever, ever forget that one."
Don’t listen to Bashers or Shorts They are trying to scare everyone to Sell!!!This will Rebound like Before…GME did the same thing I’m Not Selling Stay Strong  Let’s Go 
We are ALL OVER THE NEWS!!! CNBC is showing us on screen with AMC and GME. They put out an article talking about how much SPRT is taking off. Bloomberg Businessweek also released article last Friday. One article had very optimistic quote from Igor Duhaniwsky from S3. This movement is just getting started. We’re almost to the point that we can POST ON WALL STREET BETS
"Going to be an exciting week. Look at Fridays volume.. The short interest is still sky high, they still haven't covered! This will be 80$+ this week."
"“FOMOS” are gonna get in tomorrow, which will push this higher…the hard part will be to resist the temptation to sell… this is way more than a “meme” stock…"
"Honestly, though can someone explain to me how we have 50 million daily volume so far on a stock with 24 million total shares outstanding and a float of 9 million? I mean it literally makes no sense. There must be a TON of naked shorts flying around. There has to be. Where is the SEC? THese numbers are impossible"
"Nothing as changed. Shorts didn't cover Friday. Still 75% SI. Will be testing new highs today, and onwards of 100$ easily."
"Shills and FUD is at ATH for the weekend, BUT dont fall for their lies, don't let them get to you. FACT is that this is still Wall Streets most reported shorted stock, the fundamentals has not changed at all. In fact I believe the case is even more solid after Fridays wild ride, a lot of naked shorting was going on. The shorters and shills are few in number, we on the WINNING side are more and stronger. Remember and look at the fundamentals, SI% extremely high, the Fails-To-Deliver is high, the borrow fee is high and there IS NO MORE SHARES TO SHORT. Stick to the plan and this will skyrocket during next week, you don't want to miss this rocket! The people with the greatest conviction is making the most money on the stock market. Paperhands and daytraders get some easy gains BUT NOT WEALTH which is what we are aiming for. STAY STRONG #SPRTans target price is 300 usd!"
Up 46.45% for the day! Great Job Longs!Short Sellers tomorrow Pre Market....
revenue to valuation multiple went from like 3x to over 30x in the last week. Nvidia trades at 25x and they're not operating at a loss. enjoy the short squeeze!
Bought 100 shares at 37.50....will sell today at huge profit. Thank you.
My friend says SPRT is bigger than Google and Facebook.
"Article says no shares available to short at SPRT. With so few shares in existence this is a powderkeg...GME 56M float, 17% short, $209AMC 511M float, 18% short, $43SPRT 9.31M float, 67% short, $36"
This was quite interesting to watch! I’ve been able to understand the cryptocurrency market and I’m currently buying into the dips. If it hadn’t been with the help of Mr Randy Griffin whom I got in touch with the help of a friend. I reached out to him on 🆃🅴🅻🅴🅶🆁🅼; [ @Griffinsignals] and I must say it’s been very smooth working with him so far. I have made over $700k on my investment…
Someone mentioned something earlier about buying another share every time we see Byron post (same repetitive drivel over & over Lol) I think he is helping as he just keeps posting Lol … good thing this isn’t a drinking game or we would need rehab by now Oh & he bought puts on Friday… he claims he shorted from $50 … he is most likely underwater in his puts already too… a 40% pop today and then a sideways burn all day from there…. Options have 2 elements… price and Time…. The longer it takes for him to reach his strike (which he conveniently doesn’t mention) the faster he goes under…. He sent the smell of Desperation in his repetitive drivel. So just mute him if makes u concerned. Lol
Im in for 1200 shares..lets do this team. Lests show the man....
"You just can't buy this kind of widespread publicity, multiple articles just today."
60-70 tomorrow ??
Making money in the stock market is surprisingly simple..just do the opposite of bywon.
$75 tomorrow pre market then $100+ get on board and smack the ASK people! This is still 72% short and virtually nobody covered yet!
