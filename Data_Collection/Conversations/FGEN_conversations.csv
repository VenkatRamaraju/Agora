"With the FGEN CKD drug already approved in China, Japan and approval requested in EMEA, I see the FDA going against their committee recommendation and approving. FGEN made mistakes, but the potential patients need the drug."
Nope - only one voted for approval.
October NDA...Positive FDA meeting...tons of back half catalysts to include China pre-dialysis approval and Japan approval for CKD dialysis patients...Looking like a great 2nd half!
I could care less about what the doctors predict about approvals. The pooled non dialysis dependent data shows elevated MACE risk which FGEN tried to hide by removing the worst performing treatment group Pyrenees which AZN did not remove from their European slides and who did not make the same false statement that MACE risk is the same as placebo for the dialysis dependent group. That’s the data.
"This is down 65% because of an overreaction and people over sold and it has gotten good news multiple times this week, how is it possible to still be going down? Is it just because I got in it???"
I filled my order of 11k shares at $14.31 now lets see if it was too early to buy.
Any idea when this meeting will be done?
Could this company be sold or acquired?
"The last post -- essentially has nothing to do with FGEN -- that I can determine. FGEN's management team did a ""fireside chat"" and a Goldman conference. Likely the most important consequential information the company has ever spoken about publicly. And nada, zero, nothing on this message board. Seeking Alpha is comical in their coverage. this is a dysfunctional stock market. Honestly I have no idea what it means -- But WALL STREET blows chunks.... This company FGEN will likely be"
FDA approval in March
not a bad way to end a Friday now just got to wake up Monday at $16 or above
"No Scott, your statement yesterday in the early afternoon was you doubted that it would hold 32 YESTERDAY.And it's just a few lines down the board for everyone to read.Of course you have the right to guess todays close as well. Maybe you will get it right this time. who knows."

"Probably price falling till Friday. No doubt one day they will get approval. Besides pipeline: (from last Earnings Call Transcript) 'At December 31, FibroGen had $732.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted time deposits, investments, and receivables. Looking ahead at our broader financial picture, we have a total of $245 million of potential milestones expected this year for anticipated U.S. and E.U. approvals and first commercial sale in the U.S.Based on our latest forecast data, we estimate our 2021 ending balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted time deposits, investments, and receivables to be in the range of $660 million to $670 million, assuming U.S. and E.U. approval in 2021...'As announced today, total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $65 million, as compared to $8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The current quarter revenue consists of net product revenues of $29.2 million for roxadustat sales in China, $21.5 million in development revenue, and $14.3 million in license revenue related to NDD approval in Japan. For the same period, operating costs and expenses were $123 million and net loss was $58.6 million'"
"FGEN is establishing a bottom in the 18.55 to 18.65 range. Several re-tests of this bottom may occur and then FGEN will rise rapidly to the 20.35 to 20.65 range. Most not currently invested will miss the rapid rise, which will occur in the next three business days. Tomorrow is the third day of the selloff and in such a selloff often the day where the rapid rise occurs, i.e., after the weak hands have folded."
"Two days ago FGEN presented what all would agree an extremely poorly designed and executed presentation. I bought in at 34.7 after reading several well thought out posts on silicon investor (Biotech valuation board ) and on the IV and more than a half dozen analysts comments (only one of which was quite negative). There is no question that FGEN should be ashamed at the confusing manner in which they presented the data. People should be terminated over this and I would be surprised if law suits are not forthcoming. Frankly I am surprised that the recovery in share price has not been more substantial. To quote Piper Jaffray Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond FGEN presented ""one of the worst communication jobs we have ever witnessed with respect to a major data event,"" FibroGen's (FGEN) roxadustat data appear positive in that the drug has shown a statistically non-inferior safety profile versus controls in both pre-dialysis and dialysis settings, You have You have two days to do your own dd. IMO this has been a stupid totally avoidable knee jerk reaction."

i would hedge with AKBA. Seems there is a good probability FGEN drug will not be approved...
 The most halted stock in Wall St history 
Does anyone have an intelligent guess as to why FGEN filed for and was granted from the SEC a form CT last Friday that allows them to keep secret some information that would otherwise be disclosed in a form 10Q until Thursday Sep 24th?
Is there news that is driving down the share price today?
Why is there a resistance to stop the price from moving upwards?? It is a good news and i expect a 20% jump!!

All in at 12. This will go up to 35 in 2 months then up to 45 by December. Hold and enjoy cash
"Overseas approvals and royalties already coming in from: China, Japan etc..

"Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMF) and FibroGen (NASDAQ:FGEN) announce that the European Commission (EC) has approved EVRENZO (roxadustat) for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Roxadustat, an orally administered HIF-PH inhibitor increases hemoglobin levels through a different mechanism of action compared to injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents which are typically co-administered with intravenous iron.This approval follows the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use positive opinion to authorize roxadustat in June based on results from a comprehensive Phase 3 program comprising of eight randomized studies.The EC approval of roxadustat triggers a milestone payment of $120M by Astellas to FibroGen, and FibroGen will also receive royalties based upon European net sales.FGEN shares up 4% after-hours.

EC site Shows Approval of Evreno
ABBV FDA review date pushed out 3 months today on expanded use of an existing drug. As a article said the FDA seems to be a bit backed up and may have changed their policy and become a little stricter then the last 4 years administration. That being said I'm not sure the drugs won't eventually become approved but there seems to be a little push back on time line expectations which isn't always good news.
Just sold some AMRN buying more if it drops to 34.6
If no approval or CRL what could be the price? $20?Gl!
Select pro.: Thanks for the reply.
I'm fully out at 15.10 - 50% loss but this is going nowhere
I was right.
oh my God. I have to sell before it hits $3/share
IMO FGEN is in dire need of re-establishing itself as a company presenting reliable data and it must do so before the ad-hoc committee meeting. The current CEO must make it clear that those who were responsible for the fudging of the data are no longer with the company and that if this was a delibrate fraudulent act that the company supports criminal prosecution of those responsible. The company is in dire need of rapidly repairing its credibility with the investment and medical communities.

Huge news for FGEN :Europe has approved Roxadustat by FGEN.FGEN will get royalties in Europe from other manufacturers for this now.
They had some interesting insights about FGEN on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
The similar news already published last night. Why it did not go up at the opening instead of afternoon? Don't understand.

"FGEN PIII clinical results: The key for FGEN will be the soon to be released PIII clinical studies and they are expected to be GREAT!! Right now is a great tome to buy at this prices as the PIII results should push FGEN back up to all time highs. Expect annalists to continue with a ""buy or strong buy"" on FGEN. Let's see what they set as target price.I am a former employee who worked closely on the US/EU efforts in addition to the China and rest of Asia with the exception of Japan which will belong to Astellas. Due to the China system expect a slow start for first 2 years unless regs. have changed. Government subsidies do not start in China until 2 years after NDA."
Has there been any studies employing Roxadustat to enhance oxygen transport capacity in individuals with severe COVID-19 infections?
company should recover from this.They have other drugs that will get approved.

Great time to add pre-catalysts. Bought some shares myself. Should be an awesome Christmas this year!
Read into the latest news. This will be on an upward trend the rest of the month into earnings. They are getting over 100 million dollars in commercial milestone payments and royalties. This will fly. Mark my words. Do your own research but trust me.
"Roxadustat cardiovascular safety comparable to placebo in non-dialysis dependent (NDD) patients, as assessed by Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and MACE+ Roxadustat did not increase risk of MACE and reduced risk of MACE+ compared to epoetin alfa in dialysis-dependent (DD) patients; Roxadustat reduced risk of MACE by 30% and MACE+ by 34% compared to epoetin alfa in the incident dialysis (ID) patient subgroup of the DD population Roxadustat achieved primary efficacy endpoints in NDD and DD patients"
"FGEN's Roxadustat vs AKBA Vadadusta. 12 months from now if I had to choose which oral treatment to prescribe for my CKD patients and those on dialysis patients suffering from anemia. Although both seem equivalent, imo. I would prescribe without question Vadadustat over Roxadustat due to the fact that Vadadustat has shown in preclinical trials which is why it was awarded a $5M grant to proceed to phase II for ARDS(acquired respiratory disease) associated with deadly Covid illness and COPD and other serious respiratory illnesses and or diseases. The ARDS market alone is in the billions per year forget about CKD and the dialysis market for anemia. And which patient population is most at risk for serious COVID illness? Those with impaired immune systems like those with CKD and who are on dialysis. This is why any pharm, rep will be able to sway most Nephrologists and other doctorsto prescribe vadadustat over Roxadustat once both drugs are approved, imo, by the FDA. Furthermore there is a theory i , persoally, subscribe to that Vadadustat by enriching the blood's oxygn levels, which is why it is an excellent candidate for ARDS clinical trials, may also maintain if not improve kidney function in patients suffering from CKD and who are on dialysis which if this proves true makes Vadadustat worth Billions, imo and Roxadusta a soon to be second in class? to the primary prescribed Vadadusta, imo, Any opinions? Any analysts here? I'd like to hear from you. Thanks."
Wondering why no one is showing interest. Great opportunity.
"is the product roxadustat dead?The analysis doesn't change Fibrogen's view that roxadustat is comparable to epoetin-alfa in dialysis-dependent patients, the company said in a news release.""There is no change in the underlying roxadustat data, or to the (effectiveness) analyses from the Phase 3 program,"" FibroGen said. The company has begun a comprehensive internal review to ensure such issues do not occur in the future."""
Important. Silicon Investor Biotech valuation has a great series of posts on FGEN. The last few post 51224-51221. Clearly destroys the arguments of Muddy waters and company. Frankly either they did not understand the experimental protocol or deliberately misrepresented it to build a short case. READ the POSTS. I am buying more
"n China, roxa sales reached $96.3 million in the first half of 2021 and the business has become profitable, Conterno said. FibroGen’s commercial partner AZ—a powerful marketing presence in China—is expanding the drug’s reach, he said. By the end of June, roxa was listed at hospitals that cover about 81% of the entire chronic kidney disease anemia market opportunity in China, Conterno said.RELATED: Can AstraZeneca sustain rapid growth in China amid price-cutting scheme and local competition? It'll probably be slower, execs sayIn Europe, where FibroGen partners with Astellas, roxa in June received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s drug reviewers. The company expects a final go-ahead from the European Commission this month. Still, in the case of an FDA rejection, Conterno acknowledged on the call that FibroGen would have to “basically reassess our priorities and reallocate our resources and significantly decrease expenses.”As Porges sees it, a major restructuring should happen in the next six months to preserve capital and allocate funding to pivotal trials of its pancreatic cancer candidate pamrevlumab, a potential first-in-class antibody against connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF. The company recently modified the drug’s phase 3 trial design to enable a potential accelerated approval pathway with the FDA.Fierce Pharma"
"Sometimes stockies go uppy wuppy, sometimes they go downy wowny. The volatile nature of biotech approval mixed with market speculation, in my experience has shown me that even companies with valid drugs on the market will have huge downs on bad news and companies with essentially vaporware will spike to completely overvalued levels. Just another day on the stocky wockies boys."
"Roxadustat will be approved in USA and Europe; there’s a demand for it. The only product currently in the market epoegen/procrit available ONLY in injectables. Thus, you need medical physical appointments and needles. And the cost of each injection is $1000, that’s right thousand! Roxadustat is a pill form, conveniently patients can take it at home and no need for physical appointments. COST?$1000 per pill or less? Fgen will figure it out, it’s not cheap! But competitive pricing, already approved in Japan, chile, and China. So what if it doesn’t have better cardiovascular profile than epoegen, there is a huge demand for it because of pricing and convenience. Reversal!"

"FGEN and partner AZN (covered by Keyur Parekh) reported the highly anticipatedpooled cardiovascular (MACE) safety data from lead pipeline drug Roxa for anemiaassociated with chronic kidney disease. In our view the data were mixed as (1) Roxaonly demonstrated superiority to ESA in the incident dialysis population on MACE+(with a favorable trend on MACE), but not in the broader non-dialysis or dialysispopulations (which would have been a bull case scenario; LINK), (2) Roxademonstrated non-inferiority to the comparator arm in both dialysis and non-dialysissettings on MACE+ (focus for potential European approval) and (3) the upper boundof the 95% confidence interval was below 1.3 in non-dialysis for MACE (focus forpotential FDA approval), but FGEN has not reached agreement with the FDA on thestatistical analysis that will be employed and as such is unable to make a definitivestatement on non-inferiority. We also await additional data on key secondaryendpoints from the pooled trials as only some of this was provided on theconference call. Hence, we raise our probability of success for Roxa in EU to 85%,but leave our probability of success in the US essentially unchanged given a lack ofclarity on this front (details within). FGEN plans to meet with the FDA to review thetotality of the Roxa data and then file the NDA in September/October. We would notbe surprised if ultimately the package is reviewed by an Adcom panel in 2020. Weexpect FGEN shares to be rangebound and stay Neutral rated."

As I posted company needs a total overhaul and press for criminal charges for those who faked the data and those who sold knowing that the data was cooked. That said IMO the FDA went after the company in the Adhoc set up selecting the presentation only of the more damning data ignoring the rest. The FDA job should not be trying to nail a company but to get to the public safe needed medication. Roxa is certainly needed for a subset of patients who can not on a regular basis to an infusion center and safety could have been established in a follow-up phase 4 trails. IMO both the management of FGEN and the FDA have to go. If this application was from a major pharm it would have sailed through.
Look at the market cap of AMGEN and then look at ours. We will be at least 1/2 that market cap within 5 years. Just my humble opinion.
Scott -- Do you have any idea what you are talking about. BK? this company has 700mm in cash and ZERO debt.How does a company with zero debt go BK? They will generate multiple milestone payments with NDA filings additionally. They are also likely to start generating very high margin sales in China and Japan very soon. Their cash burn comes from Pamrevlimid which they could stop spending on any time they decided to do so.I am not opposed to shorts making their case and pressing their bets but what you are doing should be illegal.I guess we will find out soon enough -- conference call is at 5PM EDT this afternoon.GLTA

Consensus-better safety profile than ESAs.Who are you going to believe? A short report or Docs opinion on the data?"
what was the spike. Just sold at 14.70. Thank god

$FGEN Astellas Receives European Commission Approval for First-in-Class EVRENZO (roxadustat) for Adult Patients with Symptomatic Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease $gme $amc $blin $mrin $xela
"Read carefully guys, the news released this afternoon was a really Bad News! May drop well below $18 tomorrow!!!!"
Approval now pretty much guaranteed just extended to make the label clean
"Contrary to BuyersStrike and Muddy Water's Research, AstraZeneca and FGEN were not required to included the PYRENEES results. The FDA excluded the Astellas PYRENEES trial from the pooled safety analysis because the trial design used two different EPO comparators, epoetin alpha and darbepoetin alpha."
"Let me review the process. The FDA indcates there is no ADCom necessary three times and then decides differently on the day of year end results being released to the public. Additionally the process is manufactured only 19 days before approval. Wonder if some large Pharma company is trying to protect sales for a inferior product,and has some insiders at the FDA? Or amy be interested in buying FGEN on the cheap. I have no insider knowledge but this whole process smells very bad indeed."
"Anything can happen to the stock price of a company that doesn't have any product revenue and a $3.8B valuation. Obviously, the market is quite bullish on roxadustat and believe US and EU approval is imminent. I think the market is undervaluing the company for a number of reasons. #1. ESA market was a lot larger before the introduction of ""biosimilars."" so the accessible market is closer to $20B, not $10B. In addition, the patient based models only take CKD patients into account. ESAs were using not only in CKD but also in oncology. The potential for oncology is not included in the current stock price and this could potentially double the revenue forecast of roxa. If you're developing a drug, you want to chose a healthier patient population if you're trying to establish a safety advantage over the standard of care. If you did the study in patient undergoing chemotherapy, you would have to explain all the safety issues that come from the chemo and not the drug. But, after approval, you can do an efficacy trial in cancer patients and expand into this patient population. Wall St. has a post approval price target of $75/share, but I think it goes above that after approval. In addition, AZN could always come in and by the whole company. They have to pay a 23% royalty on sales which is probably 50% of their operating profit. I think there is a good chance that this happens after FDA approval of roxa."
FibroGen Receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the U.S. FDA for Pamrevlumab for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
"So is the discount worth waiting for fourth quarter approval? I think so and I added yesterday close to the lows, any return to those lows will have me ‘ finding money’ to add more"
"So it has been two weeks since I posted how dead this message board was. Little did I know (other than one reaction to my post) that was IT for 14 days. Wow.For kicks, here I am doing it again. I believe FGEN will conservatively have a 1 billion US dollar business in China, of which they will keep 50% of the profits.Simple math on small molecule drug - 90 percent gross margins or 900mm gross profit -- assume a ridiculous 300mm in operating expenses to service China -- FGEN makes 300mm pretax.. That's like $3.40 plus per share from China alone!Japan has approved. They won't lose money there. US FDA NDA any day... EU filing early next year. This is an absurd situation. Thomson Reuters STARMINE service gives the stock a horribly negative rating, 0.4 -- not that those analysts are of any value.The short position seems to have been increasing on MACE and MACE + rumors. Wall Street loves companies that burn oceans of cash -- they make 7% off the top raising the capital to keep them going. Imagine finding investments for their clients that throw off massive cash -- seriously ? there are no fees in that ! .... Very perverse world out there. Huge opportunities - IMO -- FGEN is one.GLTA"
Janet woodcock will have to resign soon due to incompetence. Regulatory landscape is about to improve. Unfortunately too many companies will disappear.
"Shorts are trapped, they are trading with each other to create panic for longs to sell so they can cover. They can keep it down as long as there are no real buyers, but we will see a spike any time, maybe today. Do not fall into this trick."
What just happened? I don’t see any news to explain the after hours drop?
FDA is slammed right now I am sure we will get the approval next few months.
"AKBA and FGEN long here, one of these 2 will be $100/share within 12 months, imo, don't know which..FTR i kicked askks (shorts) on Wall Street for years in Biotech, pharmacology background here, Bottom line I would not want to naked and short right now in FGEN especially over a weekend.. This could esily open $5 higher pre market for Mondays open, imo on any more news... or written xplanation. imo. Time for writen exlanation from the CEO to right this ship back to $50/shares, imo"

Glad I loaded up on AKBA
target 5$ )))))
PDUFA is July 15. One would expect the insiders to buy shares at these depressed prices.Last several years not one single purchase by insiders - makes you wonder how confident they are in the potential approval.
Makes zero sense....I don't see anything negative in the press release.
"I’ve found this conversation very educational. I’m a physician with 30 years of experience in medicine. I’m not a trader. Prior to this forum, I had never heard of Short and Distort Attacks. The Roxa data is extremely impressive because it is nearly impossible to show superiority vs an active control in a non-inferiority trial, yet Roxa did just that by an IMPRESSIVE margin in the ID trials (that’s the highest risk pool for MACE). The NDD studies that the shorts have over-thought only had statistical issues because they were against placebo. Since placebo doesn’t do much for people with anything other than a Mood Disorder, there were many drop outs in placebo, FGEN wasn’t willing or allowed to announce results until they met with the FDA for guidance on the statistics. Plainview incorrectly interpreted this as deception. This company has a Blockbuster Drug coming to market, with an even more exciting pipeline. If there is any legal action forthcoming hope it will be against those in violation of SEC rules. Go Long or Go back to live with your mother."
Will make enough revenue in Europe and Asia. Eventually in US when they work through the politics…
I just opened a small position (260 shares). I hope to see some good movement tomorrow when the masses digest the NDA.
"Ok John - you have a point - a very “quiet” board indeed - I worked in the erythropoiesis (red blood cell stimulation) space for most of my 30+ yearpharma career imo Fibrogen’s Roxadustat HIF molecule approval and reimbursement status in China is HUGE! Oral Rx vs injections, approved for huge pre- dialysis and dialysis markets and lowers lipids to boot - staying long"
No way this gets approved. Just look at the SAEs and MACE. Very dangerous drug.
"I doubled down today, I hope BofA analyst hits this one at new pt of $43.00"
Wondering what if any news was responsible for the drop today. All I saw was potentially good news released. A mystery?
"One more step down to go, then up up up"
FGEN will be sold or acquired soon.
"There will be a short squeeze, go look at the short interest. One good announcement and this is back on track Very harsh reflection on the stock price just for a non approval. They will get back on their feet mark my comment and watch. Buy in now while its dumb cheap."
FYI this is an ADVISORY commitee which is NOT FDA APPROVAL..they will make a recommendation to FDA..my experience lately these PANELS have been BAD and all the biotech stocks I had going into these have FALTERED...no position here just watching what happens
"I am a long time AKBA holder/sufferer - my advice to you is very simple, don't try to catch the "" falling knife"". AKBA suffered similar disappointment last September, although AKAB's was due to an honest representation of the MACE data whereas FGEN appears to have introduced some ad-hoc data manipulation. AKBA's stock fell about 75% in a single day. Investor confidence in AKBA was severely damaged, and remains so even today, some seven months later. Low investor confidence means very low buying pressure, resulting in an environment where the high volume, small trade, computer generated shorts rule the day. I see a similar path for FGEN - be aware and be careful!"
FGEN Net Income Avi to Common -231.37 Million Dollars a year loss Wow
"The FDA decision is Thursday, the 15th. Just an fyi. For all FDA decisions they can be looked up by typing FDA Calendar on your search engine."
Pamrevlumab sees a competitive drug shipwrecked. Galapagos shutters P3 in IPF. A little icing on the Roxa cake.
"Realizing that no sane person would be selling now at these very low oversold levels, especially after yesterday, then the push downwards has and is being purposely achieved by well positioned big money. What is the reason? One could be to maximize short positions and two to buy into a low cost position prior to the next leg up.I did a similar thing loading up on this drop."
Insiders making Millions bleeding shareholders dry
Price was too good to wait 34.5
"FGEN bros. A great Buy Opp in AKBA looks very oversold from $13 down to $2's and their Vadadustat looks great a pill form anemia and their Dialysis phase 3 looks great non-dilaysis had a few more MACE concerns, I see a black box for CKD and clean approval for dialysis, imo, the healthier CKD group jst needs to keep hemoglobin arpind 10-11 instead of 11-12, perhaps a simple black box and more monitoring, imo, a great entry point/ i am long 30K right here....imo"
"After dumping stock for over a year based upon undisclosed fake results, screwing up FDA-adhoc presentation and now a massive short fall in income the management declares an option program for employees of the worst preforming biotech in the bay area. These people are deserving of pink slips from the CEO downwards. Looking forward to the class action suites and possible criminal charges."
"Lol, brutal drop back to IPO low. Will be watching for a new entry point to average down and go long 2-5yrs on this puppy. At least we know where we stand."
"Roxadustat has been approved in China, Japan and Chile for the treatment of anemia of CKD in both non-dialysis dependent (NDD) and dialysis-dependent (DD) adult patients."
Classic head and shoulders OMG.
Not a holder but why would a stock be halted this long? Only have seen this when announcement imminent
Looks bleak! Doubtful of approval. Too many AE vs Epo Alpha
-50% if rejected and 100% up if approved
They had some interesting insights about FGEN on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Roduxastat SUX
That was the last time I put my trust in Yahoo Finance
This stock is not going to recover until the company carries out an open investigation as to who cooked the clinical results and when this was known by others in the company and who sold shares aware of this fraudulent data. Restitution must be made and if necessary some may deserve jail time.

"After hosting an investor call with Akebia Therapeutics (AKBA) CEO John Butler, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond thinks vadadustat's competitive position relative to FibroGen's (FGEN) roxadustat is ""stronger, not weaker now."" As such, the analyst recommends buying shares of Akebia ""before the market begins to figure this out."" Raymond left the call incrementally confident in vadadustat ""on a number of levels,"" namely its approvability given Akebia's alignment with FDA on trial design and statistical analysis. He keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $22 price target."

"First, I don't know anything but ... I have been invested in this company for many years -- years before it was public... My gut feeling is Amgen is a muscle player .. they own this space .. with their EPO drugs... and their banking influence -- I think the panty waist sell side is scared of what they may do if anyone backs this company and it's game changing anemia cure... I guess in 5 months we will know.... GLTABTW -- this is the single most boring message board I follow"
Never will see at 14.70 again.
believe it or not this is a good time to buy and hold long term
What is going on today?
"I have a feeling FGEN will do the same in March as SAGE did today,"
"After much research of patent, it appears neither Fibrogen or Akebia have a patent on HIF for treatment of CKD although both have filed for one. Both also have approved patents related to HIF. So I assume both will be approved for HIF CKD treatment is studies are approved by FDA like there was Viagra and Cialis approved for treatment of ED. The amount of success for each will depend on timing and established agreements. Hopefully both will profit or maybe they could merge."
https://clarivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Drugs-to-Watch-2019.pdfI'll take 89% and top 3 in 2023.
"it doesn't work that fast.in the speculative version, falling down, I close the deal."
"wow you fell for it the oldest trick in the market throw some negative hear say to panic you into selling your shares so the big boys can pick them up at a bargain price then in a few weeks maybe days back to $40, seen this so many times. buy if you can or hold."
I put an order to buy 5000 shares at $22.50. All I can do is hope￼
AZN will acquire FGEN for 8-9 billions in 2019. Please Note: It is just a prediction based on logic and I don't have any inside information.
"What % downside risk, if not gets approved ?"
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"

@semodough: Cowen Our Take: $FGEN Roxadustat Highly Likely To See Approval With Broad Adoption In NDD Based On Additional Efficacy And Safety Data – $AKBA Vadadustat Unlikely To Get Approved In NDD And Not Competitive In DD Either
Could be a preearnings fake out by shorts. They know fgen has been a weak stock and the pop looked vulnerable going into earnings so they’ve attacked it and created a compelling story that earnings will be bad. Probably worth a flyer to buy some shares here.
buyer at $12. I just submitted for 3k shares for quick trade. Hoping sp will collapse some time this morning and then rise back to $13 to $14. GLTA
"Yep, unexpected FDA Advisory, you... Ok, look at ACRX, 600% upside based on the July 14, 2021, BUY call:Cantor Fitzgerald reiterates an “Overweight” rating and a $9 Price Target on ACRX.Brandon Folkes of Cantor Fitzgerald believes the deals are a “significant positive”, as they build up potential sales channels for the company’s key product candidate while allowing ACRX to move “beyond a one-product company.” The analyst believes the agreement may drive upward earnings revisions down the road and expects to see more deals in the future.July 14, 2021AcelRX Pharmaceuticals (ACRX) is 'Making the Right Moves' with Recent Licensing DealsEarlier today, AcelRX Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ACRX) announced a partnership with Laboratoire Aguettant (Aguettant) providing Aguettant with a license to commercialize ACRX’s DZUVEO in Europe, and providing AcelRx with two innovative pre-filled syringe product candidates for the U.S.Under the DZUVEO agreement, AcelRX is entitled to receive up to $55M in up-front and milestone payments from Aquettant and a net split of 35% to 45% of potential European revenues.The second agreement allows ACRX to market in the US (subject to NDAs and FDA approvals) two of Aguettant's EU-approved, pre-filled syringe products – ready-to-use ephedrine and phenylephrine.

"not FDA but FDA Advisory Committee to Review Roxadustat New Drug Application sheduled for July 15, 2021"
12 no and 2 yes on dialysis dependent :-(
why are people mentioning akba’s failed drug i stopped following that thing long ago!
What is expected upside if approved ? And downside if rejected ?
"How many people can benefit from Roxadustat? How many diabetics go into kidney insufficiency or failure? Alot. How many suffer kidney failure from other causes like hypertension, intrinsic kidney problems, stones, or abusing NSAIDS (motrin). Alot. How many patients on dialysis? Alot. How many patients post kidney transplant with functioning transplanted kidneys but still requiring Epoegen for anemia? A lot. Currently the only drugs available for Anemia related to kidney problems are Procrit and Epoegen, both are expensive injections every biweekly or so in which costs around $1000-2000 (thousands US dollars) per each injection. Roxadustat will be $100 billion company, even without the better cardiac profiles than Epoegen, simply because it is a pill and it can be cheaper than $1000-2000 per injection."
I have not seen anything to indicate when the FDA might make the ultimate decision on the NDA for Roxadustat.
"SAN FRANCISCO, April 06, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FibroGen, Inc. (NASDAQ: FGEN) announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has informed the Company late today it has tentatively scheduled a Cardiovascular and Renal Drug Advisory Committee (CRDAC) on July 15, 2021 to review the New Drug Application (NDA) for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent patients."
"$AKBA, $FGEN, $ADVM $20k for each at this point. Who is the first to double? Let's see "
I had purchased 3 call options in case it was approved for FDA review but I'd be very surprised if it was after I read the report. It was a gamble. Seems like a good company. How did it get approved elsewhere?
Why is this still worth1.4B?
120k shares bought at the bottom block trade

I believe the situation is now in favor of AKBA now. Requesting additional data might mean FDA did not receive enough data in the first place or they are not satisfied with the scope or the quantity. Who knows they might require FGEN to conduct more trials. This 3 month extension could turn into a rejection or further extension or a request for more trials. When i previously compared FGEN to AKBA everything looked in favor of FGEN timing and the data but now it is a toss up. But it is also highly likely that FGEN will satisfy the requirement and drug is approved in 2021. Market doesn't like uncertainty and this is why the stock was down in after hours trading and AKBA was slightly up on the news.
"Requesting additional data is very normal. Typically, the company has the data and just need to present it in a way to satisfy the FDA questions. After all, this drug is already commercial in China. You can call the data that would come out of China Phase 4 ""post-approval"" data. There have not been any surprises from China post-approval and the FDA knows this. They are simply requesting additional data to support approval once granted. I expect that FGEN likely provided this data or will provide it ASAP with FDA approval to come prior to date announced."
"After enjoying the ride on $blue, $fgen, $odt, $freq moment, added 16K in total. Soon $advm is going break the silent and fly."
"Thank you for letting me double my position before posting this simple fact. If you talk with a nephrologist as I have done, a simple truth remains. Roxadustat meets the goals of Hb and iron. It uses an oral medication instead of an injectable, it will save time, money and improve outcomes compared to EPO."
