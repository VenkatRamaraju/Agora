Time to buy low!
Sold today at a couple of cents of the days high. 15% profit for me but considering coming back in with my original investment if it drops again. Thoughts?
PE means nothing when demand drops like it did in Canada . Fed is creating inflation . less supply and less demand does not equal boom .
Guys anyone watching HOV HOMEbuilder has gone from 8 to 15 in 30 days. Getting back over 100million dollars in market cap will be huge for this turn around play. Good luck to all. hovnanian looks like it may totally outperform the group this year. HOV Worth a look for sure.
over reaction to a KNOWN problem.

"With cloud stocks selling for a multiple of sales, it is hard to understand why homebuilders are selling for PE of 9-11. Gundlach's comments likely to help;DHI : Gundlach: 'There seems to be no end in sight' for strong home sales • 5:22 PMExisting home sales have gone from one of the lowest readings in the past 20 years to one of the highest readings in the past 20 years, and ""there seems to be no end in sight,"" said DoubleLine founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach during his webcast titled ""No End in Sight.""Conversely, existing home sales supply has declined to 2.5 months, also the lowest point in the last 20 years.Whether the housing market stays strong will depend on the whether wage growth will stay higher than 30-year mortgage rates, he adds.Gundlach believes the Fed's easy monetary policy isn't feeding inflation because ""they're not truly printing money,"" rather it's lending, he said.As housing prices rise, rents are falling. There's a ""huge shift toward affordability in renting,"" he notes.Mortgage forbearance volumes have been steadily declining and median credit score of mortgage originations have been rising, resulting in ""really strong borrower quality,"" Gundlach said.Higher interest rates could be in the making, though. ""Copper has been on a tear,"" outperforming gold, he observes, adding that the copper/gold ratio suggests that 10-year yield should be pushing 2.0%, similar to the defensive/cyclical stocks ratio.Sector watch: Obviously homebuilders would continue to benefit from the strong demand for homes, low interest rates and low supply. Related tickers/ETFs: ITB, DHI, KBH, PHM, TOL.Residential REITs, though, would suffer from lower rents; that could reverse if mortgage rates climb. Related tickers: APTS, EQR, IRT, AVB.Read comments"
Can somebody please tell me why the builders bit the big one today?I’m overweight the sector relying on the analysts advice.I got crushed today.
Back to 52 week high on earnings. Almost always beats. This quarter will be exceptional.
"I spoke to 3 different sales people in 3 different states and all of them said traffic and sales has jumped way up in the last few days, which is very good news. As many here are aware, the company also said this at the JP Morgan conference: "" May 11, 2020 Update After an initial significant contraction in housing demand, recent salestrends were more encouraging as weekly net new orders went fromapproximately 140 homes in the last week of March to almost 400homes in the final full week of April that ended May 3 In May 2020, Company took actions to reduce annual overheadexpenditures by approximately $100 milliono Company expects to realize approximately $65 million of savings in 2020"" I expect this stock to go over $45 in the next 2 months or sooner as the word gets out."
"A Miami councilman fed up with homeless people living in tent cities in public parks has suggested that advocates for people without housing let them live in their homes. I sure hope he/she is first in line and also comes up with alternatives such as housing sites for Humans to live in and have security, a base,... so as to fill those unfilled jobs. Actions of Humane consequences not words. Somehow I believe the councilperson would GREATLY object, most loudly and angrily to such a program if he were one of the homeless. So, here I thought ""Freedom"" and ""liberty"" was for all and according to some vociferous groups, not cognizant of responsibilities, accountability,... for those very rights. They aren't just rights."
"Can't build fast enough in Mountain View. Google keeps expanding and everyone wants to get their foot in the door. New townhouses snapped up $100K over asking as soon as they hit the market. $1.6 to 1.8M and rising. Palo Alto is unreachable unless you know the secret password, because much new construction is ""below market rate"" and all the waiting lists are closed."
"PHM upgraded today to ""Outperform"" by analyst Michael Dahl of RBC. The price target was raised to $53."
Average net earnings estimate for 2021 is $6.18 so they are trading with a PE of 7 right here.
"This was my personal experience at one of Pulte's developments, Elly Crossing by Centex/Pulte Homes...My advice is not to give a deposit until they put in writing what options are available. When looking at the models ask for disclosures on what options are no longer available. Just because you see it in the model doesn't mean it's available. Don't rely on pictures found on websites to decide what elevation you want either. Just because the elevation is marketed on the website may not mean it's actually offered. Ask where the closest waste water treatment facility is in relation to the neighborhood and ask yourself if you're comfortable living that distance from a waste water treatment facility. If you use their mortgage company follow through to make sure everything is done correctly. My experience was not a good one. You have to create an online profile with Pulte Mortgage and then apply. The concept is that once you apply online you can log back in for updates and upload documents and monitor the status of your application. In my case I did everything as directed but their website didn't work correctly after I applied. I was able to log back in but not all of their webpages were working and I couldn't do much of anything. After multiple communications and a conference call with Pulte Mortgage's IT people I identified the error in their programming that was causing the website not to function correctly, not their professional IT staff. This made me very concerned. I'm not an IT person but I was the person that identified the source of the breakdown on Pulte's website, not their professional IT staff. This made me lose confidence in Pulte's ability to protect my personal information like my social security number, date of birth, etc.I had issue after issue that convinced me to back out of the purchase. After backing out with the builder I notified the employee handling my mortgage application at Pulte Mortgage that I wanted to withdraw my mortgage application. Subsequent to instructing Pulte Mortgage to withdraw my application they drafted over $500 from my checking account for an appraisal that was never done on a home that construction hadn't even started on. After complaining the money that was drafted from my checking account for the appraisal was eventually refunded but the $1500 earnest money I put down was never refunded to me. I asked for a refund but was told no. Over a month after I canceled my mortgage application I received an email from someone at Pulte Mortgage regarding my ""active mortgage application"". I immediately called Pulte Mortgage to find out why they were working on my mortgage application when it had been well over a month since my application had been withdrawn. As it turned out the email I received was intended for another applicant, not me. This reinforced my concern that my personal information may not be safe in the possession of Pulte Mortgage.Everyone has their own experience, this was mine."
"Average analysts pps at $55, I will hang on for sure...fantastic news in the middle of a pandemic and the stock gets punished. I'm long, so not worried about it."
How about a joke to make me feel better about missing SNAP and PHM trading down after 4 upgrades . Went is the diff between a wife and girlfriend??? about 25lbs
PE 11.4. Price to sales 1.31. EV to EBITDA 8.74. EV to free cash flow 8.05. Free cash flow yield 9.47 percent. Industry outlook and chart are both solid. I am a buyer of PHM at these levels.
What happens when the eviction ban ends?
"How much land does PHM need?My answer is that incrementally it doesn’t really need any more. If that is the case it can continue to grow its lot count primarily through optioned lots and just replace the owned lots it sells on a 1 for 1 basis. Doing so will generate enormous FCF that the company gets little credit for in the stock market today.Let’s look deeper.PHM is on pace to generate perhaps $1+ bil in FCF this year AFTER spending $4 bil on land. This is quite a bit below expected GAAP earnings of roughly $1.9 bil, but it’s still a big number. Through 9 months PHM has generated $548 mil in FCF after taking into account substantial negative cash flow from growing inventories of $1.1 bil. Now some of this negative cash flow is for increased spending on homes under construction, which PHM will eventually turn to cash. But some of it is on growing it’s land bank. I say enough…and I think management might agree. It has ramped up lot count growth primarily via options. PHM has a whopping 6-7 yr supply of land, and 3 yrs of owned lots based on its current sales pace of 30k-35k units per yr.So how about taking a break and spending “only” $3 bil on land in 2022 and using $2 bil (instead of $1 bil) of its massive FCF to retire 15%+ of its shares!PHM would still have plenty of land and no net debt on its balance sheet.It could keep its community count relatively stable after growing in 2022. But its ROIC would skyrocket and EPS would permanently be enhanced by the reduction in shares.I think investors would like that strategy (land lighter has helped NVR, LEN, DHI attain premium multiples). Given PHM stated focus on returns over growth I think investors would cheer if mgt walked the walk (vs. just talking the talk).To be fair, PHM has been buying in a good bit of stock each year consistently. Share count is down 5% this year. PHM’s ROE and margins have also consistently been near industry leading. But given the current valuation and net debt free balance sheet, and taking into account that it owns and controls a whopping 6-7 years of land, I think mgt should put pedal to the medal on its buyback program.Would anyone else agree?!"
Severely Undervalued!!It will be in the $70-$75Range soon enough.This is what you call a Classic Value Stock.I’m buying and holding and will make Mo 
"What is so special about PHM? Answer…consistent free cash flow, industry leading margins and returns (top quartile for both), geographic and product mix diversification, and large land position (6-7 yrs, with more than 50% controlled under options).To me the biggest standout is FCF.PHM is one of only a handful of builders who can generate significant FCF and still grow the business. It’s not easy, and is what makes PHM truly unique.Over the past 5+ years PHM generated more than $5 bil in FCF after including land spend. That’s remarkable. PHM used the FCF to shrink FD shares outstanding by nearly 30% and retire $1 bil of debt, while maintaining $1.6 bil of cash on its balance sheet.FCF: 2017: $663 mil2018: $1.448 bil2019: $1.076 bil2020: $1.784 bil2021 (9mos): $548 milShares outstanding:Year end 2015: 349 milYear end 2016: 318 milYear end 2017: 286 milYear end 2018: 277 milYear end 2019: 270 milYear end 2020: 266 mil9/30/21: 253 milThat’s a 27.5% reduction in shares in less than 6 years!What is more exciting however is that PHM is in its best position EVER today.In the past 3 years it has retired $1 bil in debt and increased cash by $1.3 bil. It did this despite growing its land and house inventory by $1.8 bil. So today the balance sheet is net debt free, there is plenty of land (so PHM can theoretically cut back on land spend), and its earnings profile is significantly higher than it has been in anytime in its history.Based on current street estimates PHM will generate $2.2-2.5 bil in earnings and is in a position to use that ENTIRE amount on share buybacks. Think about this: PHM is a $12.bil mkt cap company with NO NET DEBT generating $2 bil in FCF annually. It has all the land it needs (theoretically) to maintain this level of earnings. So all of that money can come back to shareholders. If PHM decides to spend $1 bil per year on buybacks then the sharecount will come down by 8%+ annually. But it SHOULD spend $2 bil given where the stock price is today. That would reduce the sharecount by more than 15%. Moreover PHM has the wherewithal to do this EVERY year, not just this year.This is what makes PHM so compelling.Home builders trade at low valuations because they typically spend all of their earnings on land and ultimately when there is a bust they (theoretically) would lose all those accumulated earnings. Plus home builders usually carry a lot of debt as buying land and building houses is very capital intensive. NVR trades at a huge premium because it doesn’t own any land (100% optioned lots) and turns its inventory very quickly. DHI is at 80% optioned. These are cash machines. LEN is heading in this direction and so is PHM…land lighter. The result is a significant boost in ROIC, FCF, and hopefully the valuation.In the meantime, PHM should show investors the money. Replace the lots it builds and sells homes on but don’t massively grow its on balance sheet inventory, and instead use the massive FCF this strategy generates to buy back stock at 5X sustainable EPS.Investors should snap up this stock as well.Thoughts?!"
They had some interesting insights about PHM on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"The housing industry need to produce 1.8 Million units per year to keep up with demand. We never hit that number. Secondly, you know anyone that doesn't want a nice place to live? Yeah, home building industry will never be out of favor."
Under valued and oversold
"Buying opportunity on the earnings pullback. 2022 should be helped by all of the higher margin closings that are pushed out from 2021. Plus the backlog is enormous and up $80k per home in ASP. Revenue and margins should be up significantly in 2022, particularly as lumber costs come down. Community count is inflecting higher as well. Weaker orders in 3Q were due largely to PHM’s decision to build spec inventory at its lower priced communities. Should help 2022 orders. 5X 2022 EPS, with nearly no net debt. Silly! Buying in $1 bil of stock per year out of cash flow and still growing its land bank and likely cash on hand. Supply chain issues should keep finished new home inventory for the industry in check…good for pricing and margins. All the near term supply chain issues are well known and embedded in the depressed stock price. BUY!"
anyone know why the downturn today?
As Bart Simpson says it best.. “Eat my Shorts”
"I live in the Southeast and real estate sales are going through the roof. It is old story of limited supply and unlimited demand. The Shark Tank real estate mogul stated on an ad that there are 3 million buyers and only 1 million properties available. Pulte stock is depressing but not the market it serves. Low EPS & PE are very favorable. I would like to see this company's stock be rewarded and go to $63 after earnings because they are doing a great job, even for veterans"
"PHM is poised for success with the current housing shortage. They have the reserve capital and access to cheap capital from their LOC that will allow them to accommodate the inevitable demand for more housing units. What differentiates residential construction from riets is that Riets seek to capitalized rising housing prices and charge higher rents to maximize profits. Residential construction is creating value and in PHMs case, doing it in an affordable way while using durable materials and strategic locations. The housing shortage is a part of a bigger problem - too much demand. A shortage leads to rising prices, and in the current economy, this will work both ways for PHM. They will sell homes for higher, their assets will appreciate, and they will benefit from building more homes for at least 3 years (inflation and interest rates will start getting sweaty in 2024). For a short period of time, debt and capital obligations will rise but then revenue, net income, and balance sheet size will all increase. This probably won’t increase margins because they already have competitive margins and CAPEX will be higher anyways. There are a number of alternatives to PHM, notably MDC which is extremely similar but about 1/4 the size of PHM. Both will do before inflation becomes visible with rising rates, and there will be significant growth, probably 25% YOY."
"Wow, up with high volume!!! This sector is great!!!"
"I just added to my modest holding today, buying the Dip (I hope it wasn't the start of a Plunge) at $41.57, and my holdings are still modest. I am curious, if you don't mind my asking, if anyone here has #PHM as a *major* portion of their portfolio."
"So you can buy $PHM at pre pandemic price. Given all we know in the last 18 months, demand has accelerated and we are on a stronger growth path. Prices are easily keeping up with cost and margins expanding. Even if margins go back to 2019 levels, EPS and outlook has improved significantly for the foreseeable future. The only justification for today’s price is a significant compression in EPS for 2022/2023 compared to 2018/2019. Hmm? Unlikely."
Why is this and the sector down today? Is interest rate expected to go back up?
"About to see another potential 10-15% rise from the $24 level before EOM. With RSI, MFI, OBV indicators in positive territory, the 5-year and 10-year MACD formation where it's at now, I have enough reason to believe with these factors PHM is set to continue its rise in the near-term. The overall run up with PHM will likely be supported by a rise and rebound in the broader market during Q4 going into Q1 of next year; since 2018 has been mostly a period of consolidating gains and retesting support levels as part of a mini-correction. This happened in 2015 with the threat of a slowing economy in China, as well as a huge plunge in oil prices as the competition got over-heated, then 2016 and 2017 were up years. So with the broad market likely to see another run going into 2020, I think now is a great time to accumulate and hold companies that have strong management, sound earnings, solid FCF, decent dividends if any, & overall a healthy balance sheet."
Another coordinated Fraud Street sell off in housing stocks. 30 year at 2.8%. Buy with both hands.
UPGRADED doesn't matter YES it does market keeping home builders down I THINK
"This means that they are in survivial mode. Drew Cash, Not spend Cash, No Stock repurchase. So this is panic mode.Focus on managing cashflows and overall liquidity o Minimizing future cash outflows associated with home construction, land development, land acquisition and general operating costs o Working to maximize cash inflows through home closings o Quarter end cash of $1.9 billion included $700 million drawn on Company’s revolving bank facility in March o Given extent of business disruptions, Company: • Suspended stock repurchase program • Withdrew guidance relating to 2020 operating and financial results and will not be providing any new guidance for the foreseeable future"
Higher interest rates and the new housing tax laws are eventually going to take their Toll Brothers on Pulte Homes...
