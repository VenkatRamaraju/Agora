high debt ratio. be careful
why is it falling
AWR to purchase two more utilities in Pa. aquuistions galore
Another new all time close!!!
"Down again, lost 20+% since they announced what I thought was a good quarter and year to year increase in profits"
"When I see my Water stocks, #AWK being one of them going red in a good market it's always been a precursor to smart money going to sidelines waiting for markets to pull back."
"The strength in this stock is flat out ""off the chain."""
Any thoughts on where this will be EOY?
Stock is way overpriced for a utility. One explanation would be interest from Next Era which has utility acquisition desires and fully priced stock
"#VZ is part of my generational stock picks. Others I've mentioned over past 3 years (in part) are #BHP, #RIO, #AMZN, #AWK, #MO, #VALE. I'm adding #PCRFY today. I should have added months ago, but did not. Do your own due diligence on all my recs....most are low p/e high dividends and/or recession depression type picks. good luck!"
This looks absurdly over valued.
American Water Works is up 4.90% to 138.61
Bought in at $55. This is a blip. WAY long on this one.
New Highs today! Cheers to those long! Next mark $90!
"Only way this stock will ever drop is if market crashes and it goes down with it, when it does, I’m buying even more"
I sold a little Yesterday just under 110.00 simply because it gets to be too large of a position.Weren't many stocks green Yesterday with the DOW down what 650? After China said they would add Tariff's of their own over the weekend.I have started buying some WTR as some diversification. They are the #2 public Water Company and are the first to buy a Natural Gas Company due to close in a few months. That is a real wildcard.AWK just keeps generating excellent returns for me. But we all develop our own disciplines that we need to follow.For instance Years ago I know several folks who had a majority of their money invested into GE common stock. They figured it was a large American Conglomerate and would always be there. How well did that turn out?So I let nothing get to be more than 20% of my holdings.
How the heck is this thing trading where it is? seems absurdly over valued...1.59% dividend (LOL)!!!!
American Water Works reached an all time high at 153.71
"All should be very happy with 10% increase on dividend,!up $.05 per share to $.55 per quarter !"
"This is the time to buy, we had a good earrings report and the stock has been under pressure the past two months. The big boys are and have been loading shares and will very soon start releasing upgrades and positive news to drive it up, no reason (other than fed raising rates) that this stock should be down so much, remember this $79 price by the end of the year when the stock is at $95."
"considering water is the most scarce commodity on the planet AWK provides wastemanagment service as well as piping maintaice which we lose about 20% of water purely off leakage. Military Services Group, which conducts operation and maintenance (O&M) of water and wastewater systems for military bases; Contract Operations Group, which conducts O&M of water and wastewater facilities for municipalities and the food and beverage industry; Homeowner Services Group, which primarily provides water and sewer line protection plans for homeowners, and Keystone, which provides water services for natural gas exploration and production companies."" i think the ceiling is pretty hight on this one"
"At the end of the movie, The Big Short, Michael Burry says he's only going to invest in water stocks, considering the dwindling resources, climate change and the shrinking glaciers that so much of the world depends on for its fresh water. So I found this stock."
"Trump's newest plan: Spend $1 trillion on infrastructure, without raising taxesOh yes"
"I'm long time holder, but think low dividend is holding this back. I also own #MO, #BHP, #VZ and #BASFY.....2 hit 52 week high today, all pay 2-4 times #AWK dividend. I think management should be more aggressive in dividend payouts. jmho."
finally going back up.
some pull back
American Water Works reached an all time high at 158.90
"I'm having a hard time understanding why AWK is going down, or rather why it's so volatile... Earnings improved, and on the long-term this is clearly a winner...I expected people to buy again as its value dropped so much but nope??"
$150 6 months
"This one you buy a few shares and just sit back drip the div, Water is needed to stay alive."
when will it split?
"“We are off to a strong start this year with first quarter 2018 earnings per share up 13.5 percent compared to last year. Our first quarter results demonstrate that American Water employees continue to grow our business through the consistent execution of our strategies,” said Susan Story, president and CEO of American Water. ""Reflecting the company’s strong performance, the Board of Directors approved a 9.6 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 45.5 cents per share, marking the sixth year in a row that the dividend increases at or above the top of the long-term EPS compound annual growth range.Nice!"
Looks like .67 vs estimate of .65Up $1.75 in after hours trading.
At price does this become a buy? $72
"Awesome Clean Water Tech Sale, last Chance Ends in 48-HOUR @FiltrationMedia"
"Amazing how this stock does so well when there's genuine fear in the street. Imagine if we had a real depression, it might be trading at $300.00 :) I think most of us long term investors realize it's overvalued right now, but that doesn't mean that will change anytime soon. We're in a once-in-a-lifetime, historically low interest-rate environment. I've even heard rumblings that the US may go negative rates at some point. Because of this, AWK's PE/multiple has risen dramatically over the past 30 years. The default setting on the following site is for 5 years, switch it to 'all data' (to the right of the chart)https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=p%2Fe+awkLong term, the entire world printing money will end badly. Short term, enjoy the ride, but keep your powder dry."
"if anyone invested 10K in the year 2000 in awk it would have become $87,500 by now"
Top 5 market meltdown name.
"Welp, I was going to buy more....back at 121"
Have owned it from $72-$108 sold. Watched it for 2 yrs. but never rebought. No info. They stopped collecting water bills from customers for several months they have all kinds of maintenance of the infrastructure. The div is solid the institutional ownership is great. Looking for a pull back at $139 might start buying some soon. Its a long hold
American Water Works reached an all time high at 155.32
"Where does the yield need to go for this to be a buy? 2% D, SO, DUK paying much higher yields right now."
Looks like a good buy at these levels. Anyone buying?
"AMERICAN WATER WORKS, $AWK, should be FLYING HIGHER today! ... The U.S. Government Infrastructure Bill will be announced tomorrow — and very likely include funds for WATER INFRASTRUCTURE !!! ... LONG & STRONG  on $AWK !!!"
Only stock on my portfolio in the green
"California, no rain in February. Food basket is in trouble, food prices going up."
When will AWK clear 100? making another run at it.And will they split this thing? There are some retail investors that still pay attention to splits. Not so much the share price but splits are a symptom of a growing stock price.My largest holding but getting too large. So I'll be trimming some or writing covered calls to try and squeeze out a little more on some shares.Still overall a buy n hold stock.
"Generational wealth stocks, #AWK relative strength....#VZ actually green."
Thanks RWE for spinning this out. Next month 9th year of ownership.
Headed to low 70's? To me its a buy right now but wall street seems to be rewarding bad companies like M and KSS. Got to love Wall St
Absolutely sea of red with a minute tint of green. Airlines and one of my favorite stocks I've mentioned for almost 2 years - #AWK. gl.
This thing has basically flat lined for over a year.
"This stock is worth its high PE, for the security it provides investors. They are continuously buying up small municipality water infastructures and rewarding shareholders with increased dividends"
"I believe 120 maybe the bottom and you should wait to add to your position for lowering your average cost. I've been watching this stock for a while and was thinking the earnings report would catapult the share price but many stocks are being punished for great earnings such as Barrick Gold. Also, I wonder if upcoming government increased taxes and regulations are contributing to the market sell-off. Is there any news on possible buy-back, dividend increase, or split on this stock. If you have any knowledge I would appreciate your reply."
"AWK finally starting to break down. Been waiting a long time to buy in, but chart always said higher & higher, overdue for a pullback. Hopefully should bottom by mid to late October so I can finally climb aboard"
nice run up here. Solid keeper in my retirement fund.
Nice to see this working its way back towards the 52 week high.
Why would you invest in this SCAM of a company when you can buy $AWK? $AWK is the largest public water company in business for over 100 years and a member of the DJ Utilities index of 15 stocks.
the 'conversation' tab sucks.
why did it drop 3.78% today?
Buy now
All time high close!!!
A water stock that I'm buying in is dwr.cn. Been around for 6 months now so let's see were it goes $$
Dividend INcrease in about two weeks! Most likely to $.55/.56 per. share. AWK acquiring several new systems already and more to close before years end!
Easy stock to own once you wrap your head around ( Everyone has to have Water ) And that's a Fact.
Its nice to take comfort in this holding.
"Thought incorrectly the bottom was 151, looking at the chart could go to 140. Hope buyers would come back in. I'm looking to double up soon to dollar cost average down. If you can afford it, adding to your position even in a small way will pay off."
"Seems like a good company, but not at this price.P/E Ratio greater than 40 is much higher than nearly all other similar utilities.Morningstar Fair Value Estimate = 113.00"
This thing is going to get algo bought up to $150.
why is it dropping?
Looks a bit over valued at these levels.
AWK reached a 52 Week low at 96.52
"Should announce the dividend increase soon, IMHO. $.60 per quarter!"
"#AWK, which I've mentioned many, many times here hitting ALL time highs today. Generational wealth monster."
Helluva week!
"Up 10% in what a week and a half to new all time highs?Parabolic for a sleepy water stock?We did catch an upgrade a week or so ago.WTR is up similarly - and their buyout of Peoples Gas is finally final and they are changing their name.I actually own the same number of shares in bot(accidentally) AWK and WTR.Crazy move, but nice for now!A little pullback would be good IMO."
I’m shocked they missed. Oh well.
INVEST & HOLD $AWK —> Look at the Beautiful 5-Year Chart... Very Nice Uptrend! ... and an Increasing Dividend too! ... Solid Growth & Income!
Potential for a split?
"Never invest in oil when you can invest in water which is in shorter supply and is more essential. The AWK multiple is sky highbut will probably move up from here. Relative to the $trillions looking for investment opportunities, water companies represent a fraction of 1%. AWK is a ""museum piece"" that can't miss rising in price if the market goes up."
"This Tuesday is dividend day, more stock in our portfolio !!"
"is its great to buy @160,or should I wait for the dip? opinion welcomes"
That five year chart is a thing of beauty.
This is one of the best long term hold stocks. Slow and steady. Has enormous room for market cap growth. I think it's currently undervalued. Not touching it for at least 15 years.
"on #AWK....new buyers, please wait for market correction....it is now overpriced. just my humble opinion and I'm a stockholder. Just don't want newbies jumping in at ""Market"" top."
"Bounced today at bottom of rising channel and bought. Looking for a $2 to $4 bounce upwards, now!"
"When I first returned to this board a few years ago, I mentioned a hand full of ""generational stocks"". One that is always on that list is #AWK. It was in $90's when I recommended it as a generational buy. There's absolutely some things the World will always need besides death & taxes."
water is the symbol of life we all need water. i will buy and hold forever

"This P/E is rich, even for this market. However, will be justified in the end. Been in this since '11. This a growth stock, that happens to pay a quality dividend. Can you say an equity bond?"
American Water Works reached an all time high at 144.27
"HOW is this stock going up every day/ low rates are nice, but this isn't a tech stock!"
"Mentioned #AWK as a generational stock here about 18 months ago at $98....reached another ""all time high"" today. More precious than any PM.......next market crash.....buy some."
This seem absurdly over valued and owned...just like XLU.....it is COMICAL how much these have run-up since January 1st!! They trade like tech stocks!!!!!!
What do you think? Headed to $78 then can start its climb back up toward $85. A lot of companies in other industries have had a big ride in recent days. And are getting over valued.
This stock is the bees knees.
"I haven't been in a water utility in a long time. I just bought this today, but a dollar too high. So why are theyall down and XLU is up ???"
One word for those of you who were complaining about how AWK had 'stalled' 7 or 8 months ago.Patience
10.00% dividend hike announced :)
"FWIW, ValueLine (which I tend to trust) summary dated August 19 summary (official publication date, of course, not date when written) when $AWK was $117.42, had a 3-5 year price target of $80-$120. They said long term investors should avoid the stock, that ""only those who believe there is a secular shift under way in how the market evaluates water stocks should consider AWK."" Not quite sure what they mean (is there a discussion going on about some new way of evaluating water stocks?) Still, ValueLine ranked AWK 1 for timeliness, at least for the week. I personally cannot see any real growth potential, given high PE and low dividend, but I have been wrong before."
Good fortune to all the longs.
AWk up from $118 to $139 since December 15th....EXACT same chart for XLU..................whop thinks these are over valued and overbought and due for a major pullback? The dividend isn't that good here.
Closed at $112+ for first time!!!
I've been watching this one passively for a long time(10 yrs) and never pulled the trigger. Still want to own it but every time I look at it the multiple holds me back...even at $133. I'm waiting for an opportunity to start at 20-25x 2022 eps. Hoping that the 10yr treasury yld pushing to 2% will scare AWK to the $115-$120 level over the next few months but at this rate 2% may come sooner than I thought. Only concern is that rapidly rising inflation and interest rates are not kind to yield plays.
Nice.
Need 300% rate increase for higher EPS.Also get subsidy from the gov for infrastructure improvement haha
American Water Works is up 6.74% to 171.99
Why is this trending?
A U.S. Government Infrastructure Bill will likely include a lot of “Water Infrastructure” spending! ... Right investment at the right time —> STRONG BUY on $AWK !!!
Highest close today
9B in debt and growing. Meaningless reserves. Seems like a Ponzi scheme. Waive 10 million dollars in the face of municipal governments and make promises of upgrades. Use the added leverage to buy out more municipalitity sewer authorities and make more promises. The debt payment will crush the company into bankruptcy on a dime once expenses increase to upgrade fail sewer and water systems or an unexpected liability.
"Off topic...look at #AWK 5 year or 10 year chart....any long term buy and hold investors want a home run....this is just a undiscovered gem. I got in at $80 after reading about ""The Big Short"" movie character Burry (sp?) buying water stocks. They're all over the U.S. Even during depressions everyone needs water."

upside surprise tomorrow
down day
This COVID-19 induced recession is no joke. Alot of money was lost a.k.a stolen from good hard working Americans. Many financial crimes will come to clarity in the upcoming months. I'm thankful I took the time and to educate myself properly for the bear market. https://financialnews.media/the-cure-for-financial-worries The trading patterns in a recession are totally different when compared to Bullish trading theory of the past +12 years.
Like clockwork $$
"All jokes (like @Jim) aside.....#BHP, #BASFY, #NEM, #WPM, #RGLD, #AWK along with few more are 2021 buys for inflation protection and stock appreciation. Also bought physical Franc and Canadian dollar last week to put in safe. Looking for 25% gain just in currency hedge. $USD to Canadian going back to 1:1."
"#VZ, #AWK, RDS.A......much better protection with huge upside."
"Owned since $28 and will never sell! Once again, this is a growth stock that just happens to pay a dividend."
$AWK and $CCI are my top performers. They’re both about to rocket. Long term growth. Can’t lose.
"ER comes and goes and no comments here?I mean I do consider AWK a buy n hold and a steady grower but nothing?I may be trimming more again soon as it's getting too large of a position for me.Every time I look at writing AWK calls I don't and am glad I didn't or the premium is so small it's simply not worth it.AWK is still my favorite steady and sturdy stock. And although they plan to keep raising the dividend in my case the average of the shares I won are up over 140% which increases MY dividend very nicely.Speaking of dividends I did sell my remaining PM after many, many years and have a sell in for the rest of my MO. Both had taken hits over the last Year and PM had mostly recovered and MO hasn't recovered as much. Looking at using those funds for purchases as diverse as D and BP and adding to Jan 2020 calls for CGC.Good luck folks!Like I've said here before you really have no choice for water or sewage unlike every other utility.Along those lines I added to some DVA today and may write Jan calls against the DVA."
"I guess, I may be one of the few that hope this keeps falling, but whatever. This is not unusual for this to have 30% or more fluctuations in a year."
"me too, only wish that I had more."
"This recent sell off in the overall broad market is an indication, of why AWK should be a cornerstone in everyone's portfolio."
"i love this company, steady and predictable."
There it is!!!
With all this good news how low will the stock go?
"interesting no bashers on this thread, but it pays great Divs and no flippers"
any split?
"Anyone who has been here more than a ten years, has been rewarded! Not too bad for a dodgy water utility."
"American Waters just announced an agreement to sell all of its NY utilities. Being from NY, it saddens me to not see AWKs presence here"
Another all time high at closing
An oldline company whose earnings growth is accelerating because of national water/pipe problems that it is in a position to help solve - resulting in a substantial pxe expansion for AWK's stock because investors view it as a safe haven in bad times.
Great stock for the long run!
I am going to buy and hold this thing for a long time. My next Roth IRA contribution going to shares of AWK
"I've mentioned #AWK here since the $90 range for generational wealth.....great relative strength today. just fyi...if you treat pm investing as a religion, you will always lose money. Do your due diligence on your mining CEO's and see their results and compare them to their bluster on YouTube videos or any other medium."
"Why are any utilities down? Lower fuel costs, lower interest rates, people staying home, these are good for regional utilities. Can someone explain besides the baby and the bathwater theory?"
What's a good entry price? $165?
Nice rebound today on earnings news!
Another all time high. Above $100 for the past week.
"Just read year end report, very good quarter and great year to year report. Announced that the dividend broth before 2021-25 will be on the 7-10% growth at the higher end. Most likely will see an increase of $.05 to $.60 per quarter in April!"
"Hi guys. I’m looking for this company since 2019 am buying small positions on AWK. Beside all interest related benefits/strengthens, the climate will change significantly in future years and corroborated with older water and energy infrastructure, AWK can be one of the most gainers. Like all of us, I don’t know the future, but how is the price for today? Overbought/Oversold"
about time this thing fell. Waaaaay over extended
want to know if AWK will ever spit it is a good stock
"I've always been a big proponent of #VZ, #AWK, #AMZN and #RGLD. I still own and added to the first two. New buys are Shell and some others. Do your own dd....first 2 are generational wealth picks....but of course nothing is ever off the table as situation calls for. #GORO is a sell."

The 5-Year Chart is absolutely beautiful. For myself, this is a long-term buy & hold stock. LOAD UP “Big League” on AWK and sleep like a baby."
Home warranty company? What a joke. No longer a pure water play now.
Will up 10% when start
"I am long AWK, but the PE ratio seems too high for my comfort. At the current yield (1.89%) why would it go higher? Yes, I understand that there are few alternatives for investors."
Debating if I should buy AWK or WTRG. Thinking long term.
"What 'bellbell' said: AWK is more than an utility as it gets growth from ongoing acquisitions. Some of the factors IMO that has driven it up are- no China exposure- no currency exposure- small private and public water supplies infrastructure are aging and avail for buyout- modest but growing dividends- recession resistantAlso: Do what Dr. Burry say's... plus, just got that big deal with DoD. Not great profits, but leads to more good, stable, certain, contracts/income, and you know what the Markets think about certainty, right?... plus, NOT interest rate sensitive... plus, Climate Change Cultists are afraid we're going to run out of water... either last year, or the year before that!! Lastly, do what Dr. Burry say's."
LONG & STRONG  on $AWK —> Thanks for the 9.5% DIVIDEND INCREASE  to $0.6025 per quarter.
"Even with a missed EPS the reaction wasn’t too bad, also revenue did great. Still looking great"
"I'm still up 110% on this stock, but last few days have me wondering if I should sell. No news is bad news in the case of awk I guess"
They should split the stock
"We are rising, hopefully. we will continue the momentum..."
If you like water (who doesn’t and worth more than oil) keep an eye on WATR. Have held that a long time and only moved into this and one another recently. Glta.
Adding more 83-84 range if it drops there.
"Generational wealth stocks, #AWK & VZ been holding strong. #VZ dividend deposited in accounts :-) thank you yahoo posters :-)"
"If rates continue higher, this stock like Utility stocks will get KILLED! Right at $166 is ceiling.....this seems absurdly over valued here."
Any thoughts why isn't AWK moving up when all other smaller water utilities are 15-20% up since last month ?
Another all time close!!!
"I added some shared around 110, sold again around 120. I just dont see earnings holding steady, or staying at a 35+ PE. If it goes back below 110 I'll consider buying again, but how is this valuation justified?"
"@Diggs....you can buy any stock/investment you think may be a good fit.....if mining space - just buy the best -#BHP.....other stocks for generational gains - (just some of my buy and forget - picks) - #MO, #RIO, #VZ, #AWK, #NEM, ABNB, #AMZN - again, just some of my long term favorites. gl....Don't get drunk drinking any precious metal pumps....everything....everything!!!!!! - in moderation!"
"To my fellow longs, congrats!"
"@Skip @Mike @Cao I am long $AWK, and very happy with the rise to 118, but I cannot see why we should project higher prices. After all, the PE ratio is, as I write, 37.28, and the dividend yield is just 1.69%, less than t-bills. The RSI is 61.39 -- What am I missing, as I sit here expecting a decline?"
Does anyone think that selling awk at 133 and buying dash at the same low price is a good idea.Thank you for your response.
Which is a better buy american water works or h20 innovation ?

Beautiful.
"Terrie000 and others wonder why the stock has been dropping. The Wall Street Journal says (1/11/2018) that all dividend-paying stocks are less attractive now because of the stock market rally and the fact that benchmark interest rates are rising. If the yield on 10 year treasuries is 2.5%, why buy inflated shares to get 1.5-2%? I'm not selling water water utilities, but it will be interesting to see what the market thinks AWK is worth in a higher rate environment."

"Surprised this stock is taking almost as much of a hit as the rest of the market, much safer business for times like this. Could be weeks or months before we see any green again across the board"
This think could go to either $75 or 70. There is no support until those levels. I want to add here but I will wait to see if it drops further.
"Ouch, this was the biggest one day drop ever. Not a word from the company but sure hope this doesn't repeat again anytime soon."
"How do these firms even stay in business ?From Simply Wall Street:In summary, American Water Works Company has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park delivering a 198% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.I literally had to laugh out loud after reading that paragraph.

"rough winter. huge unanticipated frozen pipe costs. today stock broke 50% fibonacci retracement of $81.15a little support at 79.83.the good side, $95 march options got nice and cheap! stocked up.even with the downgrades, it will have a little pop up before the 2/6 dividend."
"Just hit a nice milestone.....I bought 400 shares of AWK on the IPO @21.50 a share....so, I am up now over $100 a share. I have 1300 shares now and havnt sold one of them."
"Did anyone add shares when it dipped below 100 ? I wanted to, but I had just done a $50,000.00 ladder CD in Jan so I didn't have any cash available."
who expects earnings to fly?
Cleaning up balance sheet for JEA acquisition. A big one.
This stock made me a VERY rich man 
"a lot of unusual options activity today. Any news? mostly spreads. I'm not well versed in options, what is the intent of this strategy?"
does this stock split? NEE utility stock split
"No good,sell it buy Paypal"
"ATTN Stephen: I started a similar discussion addressing AWK's Pe/Multiple/Valuation about a week ago. Since ValueLine seems to agree with my assumption that AWK is overvalued at this point, I thought I'd continue the discussion with a new post.**If anyone disagrees with any or all of this, instead of just giving me a thumbs down, I'd love to hear your opinion**My feeling is that the stock 'overvalued’ right now, largely due to the fact that the US & the rest of the world are in a historically low interest rate cycle. When the cycle will change, is anyone's guess ? Historically, utility stocks do better when interest rates are low. The reason. When interest rates are high, people can simply park their money in cash, or put it in CD’s, which, at that time, offer a good return, & are also FDIC insured. (Decent return, zero risk) In other words, competition for utility stocks.I got 7.00% per year on a 1-year CD as recently as 2001Compare that to today. According to NerdWallet, cd rates are about 2.50% for 1 year, & only rise to about 2.80% for a 5 year. Here’s a 35 year chart of AWK’s PE ratio & a 45 year chart showing bank cd rates. [URL=http://www.imagebam.com/image/b4421e1303572514][IMG]https://thumbs2.imagebam.com/a7/c0/e4/b4421e1303572514.jpg[/IMG][/URL] When interest rates are ow, people, who for whatever reason, are leery of the financial markets, can't get a decent return on fixed income investments, like the aforementioned money markets, & CD’s, become more aggressive, & invest in utility stocks, because those have the reputation of being stable/safe.As rates go lower & lower, more people are willing to take some risk, & invest in companies like AWK.This feeds upon itself. As more people buy in, it drives up the share price, which lowers the yield, but increases the overall performance of the stock.As the next group of people looking for more stable/safe investments look at a chart of a AWK, they say wow, this ‘utility company’ is up 145% in the last 5 years, crushing the S&P 500’s return of 45%, we have to own the stock! So they start buying. It can even attract momentum/growth investors. Anyone else remember earlier this year, or late last year, a couple people here started complaining that the stock had stalled in the 80s ? I'd be willing to bet those were growth/momentum investors.Because of the stocks tremendous performance, the yield is now only 1.60%, but when you take into account that dividends are taxed at a lower rate than interest, & the fact that that yield isn't much lower than a one year cd, people continue to pile in. I think you could call it the snowball effect.People won’t like this, but history has a tendency of repeating itself. I have no idea when it will happen, but I believe they'll come a day when interest rates get back to a more historical average, & when/if that happens, AWK won’t be selling anywhere near 34 x earnings, & the yield will go up substantially.All of the above is nothing more than food for thought. I'm not looking to argue with anyone, just hoping to hear different opinions.Full disclosure: Since I have no idea when this interest rate cycle will turn, I’m not selling. I have a total of 354.308 shares with a cost basis of $36.57 I haven't reinvested dividends since March 2016 when it was in the mid 60’s. Admittedly, that's cost me a substantial amount of money, but it's the discipline I use in my taxable brokerage account. When any individual stock reaches a certain percentage of total account value, I start taking the dividends in cash."
Upgraded by Credit Suisse to outperform with PT of $95
"Since I have owned this AWK has out-performed the Dow, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq. Plus my yield on cost is up to 5.5%. Envision my self holding for years to come."
"I get the love for this - but I'm thinking the utilities are a bit overpriced at the moment. A market dip may be a time to buy in. Also some are getting sued due to failure to update or making markets unstable... PGE in cali or Entergy in Louisaina BUT, I will look to get into this eventually I think... (already in with some ETF's)"
I think today might've been a good day to write some covered calls.
SHORT SQUEEEEEZE...time to short at $136!!!!!!!
Almost half of the market cap is junk/debt of $10 billion. I guess all of those acquisitions can not hide on the books. An increase in revenue is not keeping up with increased debt. You can bet the bank that when the rates change and market adjusts those PE will come down. I see 2019 P/E ratios of $26 moving forward.
Added today at $136
"Well ever since those brilliant fools at Yahoo, changed this board around it has been dead here."
AWK obtained many acquisitions this year and will close on several more the first quarter of 2019. Its going to be an amazing year for Water utilities !!!
It seems like acquisitions are heating up. This should push this company and the stock to new levels.
"My only concern here is the number of customers that might be lost due to businesses closing during upcoming recession/depression. I've owned for years and appreciate this great company, but Dorothy....we're not in Kansas anymore. Let's see what earnings are and more importantly the guidance going forward."
"Core and Main, infrastructure IPO, any thoughts?This is the old waterworks division of HD Supply that was sold to private equity in 2017."
Water stocks are the future!
American Water Works Cut to Neutral From Buy by Bank of America. Down another $1.50 today. Wow!
"#RDS.a or b, #VZ, #AWK must better at protection than any miner with great dividends and upside potential."
