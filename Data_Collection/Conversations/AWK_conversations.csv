"HOW is this stock going up every day/ low rates are nice, but this isn't a tech stock!"
What's a good entry price? $165?
"Just read year end report, very good quarter and great year to year report. Announced that the dividend broth before 2021-25 will be on the 7-10% growth at the higher end. Most likely will see an increase of $.05 to $.60 per quarter in April!"
"I get the love for this - but I'm thinking the utilities are a bit overpriced at the moment. A market dip may be a time to buy in. Also some are getting sued due to failure to update or making markets unstable... PGE in cali or Entergy in Louisaina BUT, I will look to get into this eventually I think... (already in with some ETF's)"
Absolutely sea of red with a minute tint of green. Airlines and one of my favorite stocks I've mentioned for almost 2 years - #AWK. gl.
That five year chart is a thing of beauty.
"This stock is worth its high PE, for the security it provides investors. They are continuously buying up small municipality water infastructures and rewarding shareholders with increased dividends"
"ATTN Stephen: I started a similar discussion addressing AWK's Pe/Multiple/Valuation about a week ago. Since ValueLine seems to agree with my assumption that AWK is overvalued at this point, I thought I'd continue the discussion with a new post.**If anyone disagrees with any or all of this, instead of just giving me a thumbs down, I'd love to hear your opinion**My feeling is that the stock 'overvalued’ right now, largely due to the fact that the US & the rest of the world are in a historically low interest rate cycle. When the cycle will change, is anyone's guess ? Historically, utility stocks do better when interest rates are low. The reason. When interest rates are high, people can simply park their money in cash, or put it in CD’s, which, at that time, offer a good return, & are also FDIC insured. (Decent return, zero risk) In other words, competition for utility stocks.I got 7.00% per year on a 1-year CD as recently as 2001Compare that to today. According to NerdWallet, cd rates are about 2.50% for 1 year, & only rise to about 2.80% for a 5 year. Here’s a 35 year chart of AWK’s PE ratio & a 45 year chart showing bank cd rates. [URL=http://www.imagebam.com/image/b4421e1303572514][IMG]https://thumbs2.imagebam.com/a7/c0/e4/b4421e1303572514.jpg[/IMG][/URL] When interest rates are ow, people, who for whatever reason, are leery of the financial markets, can't get a decent return on fixed income investments, like the aforementioned money markets, & CD’s, become more aggressive, & invest in utility stocks, because those have the reputation of being stable/safe.As rates go lower & lower, more people are willing to take some risk, & invest in companies like AWK.This feeds upon itself. As more people buy in, it drives up the share price, which lowers the yield, but increases the overall performance of the stock.As the next group of people looking for more stable/safe investments look at a chart of a AWK, they say wow, this ‘utility company’ is up 145% in the last 5 years, crushing the S&P 500’s return of 45%, we have to own the stock! So they start buying. It can even attract momentum/growth investors. Anyone else remember earlier this year, or late last year, a couple people here started complaining that the stock had stalled in the 80s ? I'd be willing to bet those were growth/momentum investors.Because of the stocks tremendous performance, the yield is now only 1.60%, but when you take into account that dividends are taxed at a lower rate than interest, & the fact that that yield isn't much lower than a one year cd, people continue to pile in. I think you could call it the snowball effect.People won’t like this, but history has a tendency of repeating itself. I have no idea when it will happen, but I believe they'll come a day when interest rates get back to a more historical average, & when/if that happens, AWK won’t be selling anywhere near 34 x earnings, & the yield will go up substantially.All of the above is nothing more than food for thought. I'm not looking to argue with anyone, just hoping to hear different opinions.Full disclosure: Since I have no idea when this interest rate cycle will turn, I’m not selling. I have a total of 354.308 shares with a cost basis of $36.57 I haven't reinvested dividends since March 2016 when it was in the mid 60’s. Admittedly, that's cost me a substantial amount of money, but it's the discipline I use in my taxable brokerage account. When any individual stock reaches a certain percentage of total account value, I start taking the dividends in cash."
Dividend INcrease in about two weeks! Most likely to $.55/.56 per. share. AWK acquiring several new systems already and more to close before years end!
Added for the forst tim ein many years - usually I'm trimming as it was my 2nd largest position.After teh recent pullback I looked at the simple finviz chart and added trading shares.My existing accounts that hold AWK are up 148 322 and 426% so these are trading shares.Love this steady stock but still need to stay diversified.
"Only way this stock will ever drop is if market crashes and it goes down with it, when it does, I’m buying even more"
"Since Q4-2015 (5 years ago), American Water Works Company, Inc. has risen in value from $50.00 to $152.25 per share — UP by 204%.And — Since Q4-2015 (5 years ago), American Water Works Company, Inc. has raised its dividend from $0.35 to $0.55 per share — UP by 57%.American Water Works Company, Inc., AWK, has made numerous acquisitions to grow its customer base. The 5-Year Chart is absolutely beautiful. For myself, this is a long-term buy & hold stock. LOAD UP “Big League” on AWK and sleep like a baby."
"#VZ is part of my generational stock picks. Others I've mentioned over past 3 years (in part) are #BHP, #RIO, #AMZN, #AWK, #MO, #VALE. I'm adding #PCRFY today. I should have added months ago, but did not. Do your own due diligence on all my recs....most are low p/e high dividends and/or recession depression type picks. good luck!"
"When I first returned to this board a few years ago, I mentioned a hand full of ""generational stocks"". One that is always on that list is #AWK. It was in $90's when I recommended it as a generational buy. There's absolutely some things the World will always need besides death & taxes."
"@Skip @Mike @Cao I am long $AWK, and very happy with the rise to 118, but I cannot see why we should project higher prices. After all, the PE ratio is, as I write, 37.28, and the dividend yield is just 1.69%, less than t-bills. The RSI is 61.39 -- What am I missing, as I sit here expecting a decline?"
water is the symbol of life we all need water. i will buy and hold forever
An oldline company whose earnings growth is accelerating because of national water/pipe problems that it is in a position to help solve - resulting in a substantial pxe expansion for AWK's stock because investors view it as a safe haven in bad times.
LONG & STRONG  on $AWK —> Thanks for the 9.5% DIVIDEND INCREASE  to $0.6025 per quarter.
