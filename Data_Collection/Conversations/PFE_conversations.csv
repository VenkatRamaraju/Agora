Ridicolous valuation for this Greta value and growth stock.I will add another shares.
These fraud hedge funds are responsible for all the manipulation. SEC should intervene.
How many of you irealize that the Pfizer vaccine that is available today is not approved? You are being misled and played like a piano.
"PFE is 65% owned by institutions. They want you to sell your shares. In one year, share price will be $60. Time to buy, not sell."
AS MRNA and BNTX are going to have 3 consecutive stock price days in the Green we are still hoping Pfizer can somehow end the day with 1 day in the green.
"Morgan StanleyOct 12,2021PfizerEqual Weight45-48"
Does anyone have earnings estimates here?? Are they making any money on this vaccine??
"told you to Buy LEU, now up 1,500% in over 1 yr. next up, ACRX, 2022 milestones, w/ Yahoo Finance avg ACRX price target = 550% upside.... like also $pfe on dips"
"FDA staff scientist: Can't see a difference between $PFE, $MRNA in myocarditis incidence rates for 18-25 males! The numbers of events are just too small."
Should have known better when it almost hit $52 it was time to sell.
"This is 60 usd Stock, the price is the biggest bargain.Pfizer has saved the world , billion of additional profits, access to mRNA technology and new medicines …Such a great company so cheap??Never for long, hence I am buying.We will see 60 USD end of year."
"88 million shares jumped ship when this thing hit 51 and got on the lifeboats while everyone else slowly went down taking their last breath. There's no resuscitating with unconscious investing. Never chase a stock at a 52 week high. You can bet if this ever hits 50 again the majority of investors will sell tanking the stock again to reload. Yes, I own this for the 5th time and yes I am down some on this last buy. I am waiting for the next earnings report and div. to dump."

Who can wait on this stock for three more months of losses. With the promise of a pill maybe by the end of the year.
"After November 2nd, PFE's stock price rose like a rocket."
What exactly is going to move this stock now?How is it possible to get back to 50 or higher?Why should investors stick around?
"Pfizer showed that it has an extremely agile and swift management that is capable of flawless execution, with their COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Where other companies like $NVAX and $CVAC faltered, and where even $MRNA’s vaccine had been affected by Sweden and Denmark recently, Pfizer alone came out unscathed. Pfizer’s vaccine requires ultra low temperatures, lower than that of any other COVID-19 vaccine; but that did not slow down the rollout one bit. Pfizer’s vaccine is the first one to get emergency use authorization from FDA and is the first one to get full FDA approval. In May 2021, Pfizer’s vaccine was the first to get emergency use authorization for ages 12 to 15. Pfizer is currently working on a vaccine for ages 5 to 11 and already submitted trial data to FDA. What an awesome management!!!! I am impressed by them. Wish the stock reflected that…."
Many institutional investors are buying today. Maybe they already know the situation in the third season.
I think this is controlled by Mobesters!

"Going below $40, buy below $40, sell above."
Does anyone feel that it is better off to contact pfizer management as a class of investors buying their stocks? I am highly unsatisfied of pfizer stock's recent performances.
On Yahoo Finance PFE you see every day at the opening of the market a big buy of 1 million shares and a jump upwards of the PFE price. Is this Pfizer buying their own shares? But after that big buy PFE goes down for the rest of the day. An explanation?
Possibly one more week of this downward pressure before stock reverses.
Lets see what happens on Nov. 2nd.
To BenzingaRecent release on PfizerOptions activity show 50% Bullish 50%Bearish on Calls & Puts 33.50-45.50
"The stock has had about 85% down days over the past 50 days, despite more and more good news regarding selling more and more product. Could they at least buy some shares back to show some solidarity with shareholders?"
"If having an approved and distributed vaccine isn't lifting the price, then this stock is just about the divvy only. Great company, just no growth."
"A BIG BARGAIN.PFE ist 60 USD stock, everybody who can do the math will agree.Value and growth."
"Moderna up 4% and PFE down 1,8%. Something with this company is going very wrong?"
i beleive this stock requires a sec investegtion. The company earn huge amount of money but the stock does not going up. Is someone takes the profits??
Now wow
PFE has increased div every year for the past 10 years. In 9 out of 10 years div increase was 8 cents per year. Looking for good earnings report and div increase of 8 cents.
Moderna getting negative press over only selling to wealthy countries.Does that affect PFE?
in Europe more and more countries have stopped Moderna vaccine for young people and they take Pfizer instead.Good news for Pfizer.
Merck`s covid pill will not eliminate the vaccine.PFE is also developing a treatment pill for covid.The market for vaccines and treatments is huge.It will take more than 1 company to manufacture sufficient medicines to fight covid.Covid aint going away.Today`s dip was a buying opportunity.
"I totally agree with this statemement. Fair value is 60 USD.There are many interesting things at play with this company. these days. By that i mean, not just the pending Q3 earnings but also the covid pill clinical trial results in q4, the size of the global market for their booster vaccine and potential combo with the annual flu vaccine, Possible sale of the GSK jiont venture with an indicated value of 18 billion for PFE next year as an add on to its cash hoard from vaccine sales this and next year.They have a unprecedented valuable global presencce and strong manufacturing, sales and marketing and distribution strengths which angers well for new partnerstips. What they do with their 70 billion cash resource will be quite telling. Exciting times!"
Can someone please explain how pfe can sell so many doses of the vaccine and the stock not go up? Moderna didn't even have a product till it came out with a vaccine and it goes through the roof.
There are no Riches hereNo growth for over 20 yearsNever Trust this Company
"The PFE CEO has been accused of slow walking vaccine approval until after the US presidential election. The release of the vaccine within hours or days of the election outcome, clearly—with hindsight—ultimately caused long-lasting harm to PFE and its credibility. Unintentionally, Fauci’s claims that “the best vaccine is the one you take” just added diesel fuel to the dumpster fire—particularly after it became clear to clear thinkers that the rate of multi-day side effects were more prevalent with the PFE vaccine, AND that the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine was longer lasting. In summary, once again, what went around, came around—whether it was done purposefully or not.Let the PFE experience in credibility destruction be a lesson to drug companies who decide to play politics, or who suffer from poor timing and the appearance of impropriety. . ."
Manipulation everyday
"Looking at the last ten days of historical stock prices for Pfizer, the stock has been down in the RED 9 out of the Last 10 days. You do the math, 1 Green day out of the last ten trading days."
Sell PFE at 50 after quaterly results and buy again two months later when it is back at 40. This is a very predictable stock.
couldn't hold a penny gains
the stock is worth 65 dollars but big money control it
Is anybody got bored by this stoc? I hope I am not alone...
Just buy and accumulating long here
I believe PFE would bounce back up to green today. Feel bad for those that sold at 41.70 earlier. Thumb up if you believe it would be back to 43 today.
"Coming into today, shares of the drugmaker had lost 8.35% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 6.02%, while the S&P 500 lost 3.58%."
"Support is now at about $40.00. Lower than than, look out."
"CNBC is getting to be like what's his name (ex WH occupant) that called an end to Covid about 2 months after it was ""discovered"". I believe todays call of the ""reopening trade"" is about the 6th one. So, eventually they will get it right. The question is when. If they keep calling it people get less and less cautious while the traders profit off their selling off one sector to buy another, than rebuying the old sector from funds acquired by selling the sector they just bought a few months before. Hold for a meaningful vaccination rate and no new variants appearing as did Delta from peoples ????"
"PFE stock price is undervalued. PFE's EPS this year can reach $4.5 after the vaccine price 25% rises. The EPS average annual growth rate of YoY over the past 5 years has reached 31%. The current valuation of PFE's PEG is only 0.6. Peter Lynch believes that if the PEG is lower than 0.75, it should be strongly bought. When PFE's PEG is 0.75, the stock price is $55. But if the average PEG value of Drug Manufacturers-General in the industry where PEG is located is 2.82. PFE stock price will be much higher. I look forward to the third quarter earnings report on November 2."
I wish bad things happens to whoever is selling short on PFE stock. Karma will come. Trust me.
Is there a clear reason for the share price slide over the last 5 or 6 months? Insider action?
"I’m an investor truly believe in the science. EUA soon.Zyesami will be also approved in a nebulizer formulation.

"Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine Is World’s Preferred ShotCountries from Latin America to the Middle East have lined up for the shot, driven by its effectiveness and ample supply, especially compared with Chinese and Russian rivals."
I'm not a stock expert by no means but Pfizer is very boring stock .I bought 1000 shares@ $45 and had hopes to make some money. With all the government paid doses why hasn't this stock moved ??? Are they mismanaged ??? Any advice???
What a joke
"Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that its board of directors declared a 39-cent fourth-quarter 2021 dividend on the company’s common stock, payable December 6, 2021, to holders of the Common Stock of record at the close of business on November 5, 2021."
The worse investment ever!
Stop playing political games. Investors are patiently waiting for the green light

"if only they announce stock buyback, this will blast to $100/sh. With all that cash, it's the next thing to do."
"Tell me again why this is going to be a $60 stock?What about competition and hopefully receding covid?What's the catalyst ?Also what are the consequences for the ""analyst's"" who get it wrong?"
"Next earnings release date is November 2. Hope the stock goes up before that date in anticipation of good earnings and even more after the date, if the earnings beat expectations. The stock seems way too undervalued at present."
"Here's to hoping next week PFE will start going up heading into upcoming earnings report and dividend payout. I like the color red, but not when it comes to my stock picks."
90% trailing revenue growth and next quarter likely to accelerate - on $20B of recurring EBIT…..amazingly low valuation for this cash machine.

Dear PFE management - I know you monitor this chat - please announce significant share buyback with 2021/2022 excess profits from vaccine at ER. (Longs - pls upvote this so management sees our desires.) Long and strong!
"go up as hard as climbing the mountain, but when it goes down as fall from the sky fast as jet. Oh, my boy"

They had some interesting insights about PFE on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"This company is nothing, but a horror movie."
Trades like Meme stock but not in wide daily rangesbut STILL in downtrend since Vaccine 1 approval
I bet Pfe announces the pill just after earnings or during the earnings call

Hedge funds want it cheap
Can management please report a share buyback of xx billions it doesn’t mean you have to do it all but that would help increase EPS moving forward and they can save on dividend moving forward and it would signal to the market and their shareholders that they believe company is undervalued !!!!
"MRK up today 6% from their covid pill, and PFE covid pill coming soon."

"I bet Pfizer beats earnings, raises guidance, raises the quarterly dividend by .04, which brings the yield to around 4%, which I think is just outstanding. I have ZERO question this will be a $60 stock by Christmas."
PFE has a face only a hack dividend investor could love.
"In anticipation of record earnings reports in the next quarters, I bought 3k shares today. My financial advisor urged me to do so as he sees PFE going back up to 50 by year end. He's always been right, so I listened to him. He said that the dividends is just icing on the cake."
Pfizer running a lot of ads promoting the high dividends tells me they have no intention of any significant stock buybacks. Longs will have to be content with a slow growth investment.

risks of vaccine FAR out weigh benefits of vaccine especially for kids
Current downturn is not due to Merck pill or end of Covid or any other minutiae. PFE had long downturns pre-covid that also did not depend on the health of the company. It's just the way PFE rolls - long upward climbs are followed by long sell-offs. Invest accordingly.
Good news after good news.Earnings should be interesting.
"With all the money they earned, the dividend should be up. Let's hope it goes up by 10 cents or at least announce a special dividend to secure the stock bottom. Please deliver the idea to management!!"
"From Barron's today, regarding the Merck pill:...Some scientists who have studied the drug warn, however, that the method it uses to kill the virus that causes Covid-19 carries potential dangers that could limit the drug’s usefulness.Molnupiravir works by incorporating itself into the genetic material of the virus, and then causing a huge number of mutations as the virus replicates, effectively killing it. In some lab tests, the drug has also shown the ability to integrate into the genetic material of mammalian cells, causing mutations as those cells replicate......Scientists who have studied NHC, the compound that molnupiravir creates in the body after it is ingested, however, say that Merck needs to be careful.“Proceed with caution and at your own peril,” wrote Raymond Schinazi, a professor of pediatrics and the director of the division of biochemical pharmacology at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has studied NHC for decades, in an email to Barron’s."

"Pfizer said Monday that it is now testing a pill that could help people ward off COVID-19 if a close contact, such as family member, gets the virus.The drugmaker said it is looking at the efficacy of the pill as used in combination with a low dose of the HIV drug ritonavir in people who are at least 18 years old and live in the same household with someone who has COVID-19.As if this success would raise share price!"
"It's headed back to 36-40, where it was even before Bush v. Gore.

I'm certain that LLY shareholders thank their lucky stars they have had David Ricks and not Albert Bourla. LLY is the growth company PFE could have been. LLY stock is up three or more times in the last 6 or seven years. PFE is where it was when Monica Lewinsky was in the White House. That tells you something .... earnings of 1999 = stock price of 1999. It's very simple and everyone on Wall Street knows it."
This stock keeps circling the toilet bowl. Today will make six red days in a row.
What Bank or institution is the big short here ?
"So, Senator Ron Johnson, you can't complain about both sides of vaccinations. Specifically the article out where he is complaining that the PFE vaccine is the only one with full FDA approval, J & J as well as Moderna do have emergency approval as many drugs do in process of full approval/after a great deal of research for efficacy and few if any side effects.1. Sen. Johnson complains about the US not having enough PFE vaccine to fully vaccinate all military members as well as Medical providers. IMO, 95% or greater of Medial providers have been vaccinated by approved vaccines, just because it is declared an ""emergency"" approval doesn't change the efficacy of the vaccine: 95%, 95%, 92% which is endlessly higher than being non-vaccinated. 2. The reason for not enough vaccine of PFE is the non-vaxers not getting vaccinated when there was plenty and batches had to be thrown out as people didn't come in for the shot. That, due to miss information such as you are attempting to promulgate. The issue is that of the last occupant of the WH, who disregarded Pres. Obamas detailed plans for any Pandemic & admits he did the opposite of what the experts, especially Dr. Fauchi said. This is IMO malfeasance, dereliction of duty, ignorance of providing guidance in speeches and doing his utmost to encourage states to mandate CDC guidelines at the beginning of the Pandemic/Certain state Governors utter failure to provide protection as per CDC guidelines for Covid.So, you can't complain about:-not enough vaccine. when there are plenty. while also-complaining of people working for the federal gov't being appropriately mandated to be vaccinated."
Looks like investors can't get out of this stock fast enough. Who are you going to believe columnists that have no vested interest in the stock or your own eyes with the mass exodus. Something is wrong and it won't be exposed until Nov 2. Could the non-Covid business be that bad that we are being dragged down.
Just be patient. This will fly to the moon very soon.

"As Yogi Berra said, ‘predictions are difficult, especially if they involve the future.’”"
"I know this dog well. I personally don't like to own PFE above $38, and even at that price I feel I'm still rushing and being way too impulsive about wanted to buy shares of this mega-pharma. Reason: four times bought it above $40, four times proved to be a costly mistake. (I did not lose money but I had to be super patient while seeing the market recovered and reaching new highs, this dog meanwhile sunk bellow $33.) Some of the early spin-offs have offered good returns, no so sure about Viatris though. Even considering dividends, no early retirement will come from this dog, Pfizer needs to be way more honest with its shareholders and its shares, fly and STAY way, way higher."

"Moderna made a strategic error when they set their vaccine dose at 100 micrograms (Pfizer's is 30). Although Moderna's antibodies may last longer, younger folks are experiencing serious issues. Sweden banned use of their vaccine for those under 30 years old. And Denmark did the same for those under 18. Wonder what company will fill this void???"
"While PFE has been frustrating and surprising…..actually like the fact that everyone (even the bullish) seemed to think no amount of good news will cause stock to go up…….usually the mood right before the big gap up! Most undervalued stock on DOW, I believe."

"Jeez, it's just good news after good news after good news. We just can't catch a break. Hopefully, we'll get some bad news tomorrow. Sure hope so, I can't afford much more good news."
Nov. 2nd before the open you will know everything you need to know about PFE. They beat last two qtrs and the next should blow past estimates as many more people got their second doses. Here's something to remember. The booster shots will not show up on the next earnings report because people are just now getting them and for the next few months since you need to wait 6 months from your last shot. Many got their second shot in April or even May so they need to wait until Oct. or Nov. for the booster. I expect 2022 to be their biggest earnings report starting with the 1st Qtr. and more in the 2nd qtr. Can anyone wait 8 months for their return? Just sit back and collect a couple more dividends to boot. PFE is the first out for the booster so they have a jump start on the competition.
It would be a terrible development if people thought the new pill from Merck will be the end of vaccines as one story indicated today. What terrible misinformation given by some journalist. The pill prevents severe disease. It doesn't prevent Covid. Who wants to even get Covid? Who would even want to have the long-lasting effects of Covid for the rest of their lives? Only the vaccine can stop a person from getting the Covid infection.
oversold $PFE
Pfe building base here and it will goes just like what happen to reach $52 no stop.... this time will be $60 and back to $50 base..... Meanwhile enjoy your Divi....
Did you trust me and listen to me when I told you to buy PFE yesterday or day before yesterday?A lot of great news comes out recently especially the one that says PFE is in 3rd phase of oral intake COVID-19 drugs. Today is just the beginning of PFE's pps rebound.
Have an acquaintance on Medi-Cal who refused to get vaccinated. She came down with Covid-19 and needed hospitalization (All paid by the state). Wouldn't it be prudent (and financially sound) to require all those on government support to be vaccinated?
"From USA Today: ""Vaccine mandates will boost vaccinations by the millions, White House report says"". With Moderna's stumbles and lack of authorizations, expect Pfizer to grab most of this business. The only question is when will PFE stock respond (Currently up a whole penny pre-market)???"
Booster approval and it drops 2%. Hhhmmm seems about right. ?????????????????????????
"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Monday,4.10.2022. 16:52 Sweden's Public Health Agency said on Monday it recommended the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's, $pfe $bntx Comirnaty vaccine against COVID-19 for children between 12-15, opting against rival Moderna (NASDAQ: $MRNA)'s Spikevax.."
"PFE stock price is severely undervalued. PFE's EPS this year can reach $4.5 after the vaccine price rises. The EPS average annual growth rate of YoY over the past 5 years has reached 31%. The current valuation of PFE's PEG is only 0.6. Peter Lynch believes that if the PEG is lower than 0.75, it should be strongly bought. When PFE's PEG is 0.75, the stock price is $55. But if the average PEG value of Drug Manufacturers-General in the industry where PFE is located is 2.82. The PFE share price should be worth $203."
"Iceland, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark......ALL banned the use of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine in younger people (Due to cardiovascular side effects). If you HAD to guess which company's vaccine they are offering instead? Didn't matter, Pfizer stock fell today anyway. Maybe on Monday we soar???"
"Waiting for the third quarter report to be released on November 2. Facts will prove that 95% of analysts seriously underestimate the EPS of PFE.After November 2nd, PFE's stock price rose like a rocket."
This must be the biggest manipulation of this century. And PFE and the SEC are not aware of anything strange happening?
"Good news after good news, stock is still down. If the next earnings do not take this stock trough the roof after all of these Vaccine sales, I don't know what will."
Many were fooled into the jab. Going forward is much resistance. Natural immunity is king!
"Wow, this stock just cannot hold a gain, can it? Ever since the pop above 50, it just wants to mean revert back to the $38-$40 range, unbelievable. I'm hoping maybe some strong earnings will get it back on track, but what a headache this stock is."
"After the third quarter quarterly report is released, the market will see that PFE’s EPS YoY growth rate exceeds 200%, and prices below $50 are all low-priced areas."
"PFE has a Force of Nature event in its favor. Over 70% of covid vac comes from them. Contracts are pouring everywhere they are swimming in cash and cash prospects and yet the stock goes down. They jacked up the price and now making more money even though dumping their stock as this decline is institutional, not retail. This is froth and they should be in prison."
"This stock is a phenomenon, gravitating towards 40 for 20 years, despite a vaccine and booster that generate $billions in continual revenue and mRNA technology that can acquire even countless vaccines and treatments for endless diseases like HIV. Management needs to spend a few billion$ just buying back shares to manipulate the fk out of it."
I love Pfizer 4 days a year...on Dividend payout dates.
According to WSJ Pfizer's shot is the global global leader with 3.54B shots. Earnings will be great...
"I find it very interesting that EVERY time any good news comes out, price declines. I know it is hard to manipulate a multi-billon dollar stock price, but I have to suspect it. Even though short interest in PFE is small. Anyone have any insight on this? What is teh driver to push down this company stock price? I just don't get it."
Investigation about hedge funds manipulation must be requested now
Still looking for a re-entry point for PFE. Not until two consecutive green stock price days. After today the PFE stock price will have been red for six consecutive days. The stock is still circling the toilet bowl. How long will this carnage go on?
i BOUGHT MORE PFIZER TODAY THANK YOU FOR THE BIG DISCOUNT..!!!!!!!!
"if pfe finishs covid 19 pills, will the pfe go up like Mrk 6% ? mAYBE NOT because for pfe good news is bad news and bad news is bad news."
Moderna going up and Pfizer down ?????
Does PFE CEO or BOD ever comment about low stock price appreciation ? They are compensated well & stockholders appear don’t matter?
"Say ANYTHING you want negative about Pfizer. NO COMPANY performed better under emergency situation of Covid-19.Moderna - Discovered to be money-grubbing, self-promotional a-holes. Don't ever forget they did secondary offering and CEO sold shares after pimping their technology.J&J - Had enough troubles before the pandemic. I give them a Silver medal for even getting anything out the door.Other Pharma - Coundn't get the job done. Over-promised and under-delivered.PFIZER IS THE CHAMP. ALMOST 4% DIVIDEND. 80-YEARS OF DIVIDEND INCREASES."
I received Pfizer vaccine in feb. My partner received mRNA at the same time. We cohabitate. We are both healthy 69 yr olds. End sept I had minorsymptoms and took a test. Positive. a breakthrough at 7-8 months. She is still negative. I sense the Pfizer reporting is lacking and that this story will repeat. This is obviously more serious with pfe explains there push to booster at 6 mo.
Everyone is jumping on the COVID bandwagon. Many drug companies are now distributing doses in the U.S. and other countries. When PFE hit $38.00 a share the analysts were saying that the vaccine was fully priced into the stock and it was at fair value. Then the chasers came in and it went through the roof. Will we see $38. soon or will the earnings be such a blowout that the stock goes higher than $51.00 and change? The answer will come in Nov. If the earnings are a total blowout a special dividend should be in play but the insiders will take their free options and bonus handouts before year end; probably at Christmas and the lowly shareholder will get the B_ _t job once again. Hope you have stop losses in place.
back to $39 soon
"Lots of potential catalysts for pfe. Approval of covid shots for children, great earnings announcement, increase in dividends due, increased sales of covid shots in europe due to preferred status of pfe vaccine, good data of phase 2/3 of covid pill, possible stock buybacks from proceeds of covid vaccine. Exciting times for pfe longs."
PR phones at Pfizer should be flooded with calls asking orcomment by CEO
"Pfizer Inc and BioNTech have asked U.S. regulators to approve emergency use of their COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11, Pfizer said in a tweet on Thursday. FDA to meet October 26."
Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see 75% zack buy and strong buy stocks will go up in next 3 month the earning is up 50% to 75% price target also is up to $61 next ex dividend is 11/5/21 pe is 10 buy more and hold enjoy dividend 3.6% in one month
It appears the new patent given today covers both $MRNA and $PFE / $BNTXCovid Vaccine. This is a very good one!
Pfe themselves said that covid could be over by end of 2022. What happens to earnings by then. SP is a forward looking thing.
Pfizer $PFE is trading lower than when it made Covid19 Vaccine in general. Bullish from here
"From the Share price you would think that Pfizer had made a $50 BILLION LOSS, Not made$50 BILLION Profit. If $50 BILLION wont make the share's rise then nothing will surely ?."
Remember both Pfe and Modena with Biontech are mRNA all are working on cancer vaccine this would be trillions in revenue
"PFE needs a miracle more than vaccine news. As @media said, the good news on this company does nothing on the stock price. I’m very disappointed that I’ve invested on this one and lost quite some money for now, so I’m looking forward for the miracle to happen "
Breaking news: European Union regulator approves Pfizer booster shots for those over 18. Draw your own conclusions.....
"PFE pays an annualized dividend of 3.68%, which is slightly above average for a large-cap pharma stock. What's more, the drug maker expects to spend over $5 billion in share repurchases under its current program you will see stock buy back soon"
Got my PFE booster shot yesterday since I fall into the covered group (over 65 and on chemo). So far the only effects I had has been soreness for a day at the injection site and tiredness. In full disclosure I am on meds that cause tiredness but I did fall into a deeper sleep than usual. Aside from that I don’t feel anything else unusual.
we will be $60 by end of year.... Collect Divi as well....
"What happens to all those that predict a $60 target price?Where is their accountability?Same as a weather forecast,"
"Shorts playing with fire and one Trader took the opportunity at the last minute today, they bought more than 500,000 shares in 1 min at 15h59 !"
this is all controlled by big money
"look at the FLXN buyout today, $500 million for their 1 knee pain drug... ACRX is worth $2 billion: FDA approved pain drug launch underway, European launch 1st 2022, Asian discussions underway, ACRX 3 NDA (soon FDA approval) ready drugs... ACRX folks, do your digging...$pfe my gut buys ACRX!"
How do you get a stock down of a company with a ww reputation and making billions? And is the idea to keep it down to make it act like a coil spring with the release of the quaterly results on November 2 and make a lot of money the next days? Will the scenario of August repeat itself? Any ideas?
"Studies out in heavily vaccinating countries showing you may be better off after 7 months, NOT having beenvaccinated compared to having been vaccinated. This kind of data may explain the consistent drop in pricefor the last two months. Check out REGN and monoclonal antibody cocktail for early covid treatment. I had to throw that in there, I am long REGN, trading at 10PE with minimal debt."
