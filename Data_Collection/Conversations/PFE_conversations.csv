PFE news was expected but the real news is that they will be the ONLY APPROVED vaccine. This is huge because a large amount of the unvaccinated population will now believe it is safe because of the FDA approval and actually get vaccinated with the PFE vac not Modernas. More institutions will now MANDATE a vaccination to return to work or they will be terminated. Many dont know this but moderna vaccine is being looked into by the FDA because of deaths due to heart problems from use of the vaccine. This bolds well for PFE. Analyst MUST upgrade the stock in a big way this coming week they have been ASLEEP at the wheel. ALL estimates have to be raised.Monday we take out the 52 week high and continue MUCH higher for at least a few days then a small pullback IOM and then the charge higher over the next year.ENJOY LONGS
"Shorts, your time will soon be up. Pfizer has so much going for it now. It’s a bargain at this price. They are staying one step ahead by investing in a oral treatment and a enhanced vaccine to protect against new variants.Buy and hold! Don’t let the shorts manipulate you. Buy the dips and hold. Time for the retail investors to take control here and do their part. This stock won’t be held down for much longer. To the moon!"

"Vaccine's efficacy, doesn't matter if MRNA or PFE, is lower than claimed by looking at the numbers in Ontario. Blame the anti-vaxers all you want, blame delta all you want but once again the public was lied to. Is it better jabbing than not? Maybe... but the public and governments were dupped. Why require 3rd doses if the vaccine worked as advertised? This is my opinion, my observation."
Robinhood or Pfizer. Which offers the better return going forward.

"U.S. FDA Approves TICOVAC, Pfizer’s Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) VaccinePFE+2.62%Sat, August 14, 2021, 1:18 AMIn this article:PFE+2.62%My WatchlistQuotesView my watchlistsTICOVAC may help reduce the risk of TBE for people traveling to endemic areas, potentially including military personnel serving in these locationsNEW YORK, August 14, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TICOVAC (tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine) for active immunization to prevent TBE in individuals 1 year of age and older.1 TICOVAC is the only FDA-approved vaccine to help protect U.S. adults and children against the TBE virus when visiting or living in TBE endemic areas. Following today’s FDA approval, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is expected to discuss recommendations on the safe and appropriate use of TICOVAC.""We are proud to deliver the first vaccine to help protect people in the U.S. against TBE, if they are traveling to any risk areas,"" said Nanette Cocero, Ph.D., Global President, Vaccines, Pfizer. ""This vaccine has helped to protect millions of people in TBE endemic regions since its first approval outside the U.S. 45 years ago. This authorization helps to ensure that people from the U.S. are also able to receive this vaccination if needed, reflecting our commitment to provide health for all.""TBE is a viral infection of the brain and spine,2 which can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick.3 Although TBE is not endemic in the U.S., to date, it has been identified in more than 35 countries across Europe and Asia.3 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) currently recommends TBE vaccination for people who live in or are traveling to risk areas.4More than 45 years of experience with the Pfizer TBE vaccine exist outside the U.S., and more than 170 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed since 1976.5,6About TICOVAC (Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine)Pfizer’s TBE vaccine, marketed under the brand names FSME-Immun and TicoVac in Europe, and TICOVAC in the U.S., is developed using a master ‘seed’ virus that is similar to the TBE virus found in nature.7 It is able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the natural TBE virus, as the sequence and structure of the virus subtype match those found in nature.8In clinical trials, the safety and immunogenicity of TICOVAC were assessed across two age groups (1-15 years of age and >16 years of age).6 In these studies, seropositivity rates were 99.5% in 1-15 year olds and 98.7-100% in adults >15 years following three doses.* 6,9,10 Clinical studies demonstrated that TICOVAC was generally well-tolerated with no unexpected adverse events or vaccine-related serious adverse events observed.11,12 The most common adverse reactions across both age groups were local tenderness, headache, local pain, fever, restlessness, fatigue, and muscle pain.11,12 Real-world studies from Austria have shown that the vaccine is 96-98.7% effective in people who have received at least three doses of the vaccine.13,14About TBETBE is a viral infection of the brain and spine,2 transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick,3 and less frequently by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products from infected animals.4 It may initially be mistaken for summer flu,15,16 but can be a serious condition with possible long-term consequences.2,16 1 in 3 people can have long-term effects that last months or years including cognitive changes, muscle weakness or permanent paralysis,2,16 and in rare cases (0.5-2%; up to 20% in Russia), people may die.17,18 TBE can affect people of all ages who come into contact with ticks whenever they do outdoor activities in countries where ticks infected with TBE are prevalent.2,18U.S. Important Safety Information for TICOVACTICOVAC should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of TICOVACAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of TICOVACSome individuals with altered immunocompetence may have reduced immune responses to TICOVACTICOVAC contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). No cases of transmission of viral diseases, CJD or vCJD have ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin contained in other licensed productsVaccination with TICOVAC may not protect all vaccine recipients against tick-borne encephalitisIn clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions in subjects 1 through 15 years of age who received TICOVAC were local tenderness (18.1%), local pain (11.2%),"

"Pfizer-Data from trial of booster shots will be available late Sept-Oct will submit data next month on children ages 5-11; may apply for emergency use in October .Americans who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines should get a booster shot eight months after their second vaccine dose, federal health officials said. The boosters will be available beginning Sept. 20, if the Food and Drug Administration agrees to the plan."
"Pfizer Submits Third-Dose Data to FDA (11:35 a.m. NY)Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE said they have submitted Phase 1 trial data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine. The companies said in a statement that people who received a third dose of their mRNA vaccine showed “a favorable safety profile and robust immune responses.”Pfizer Taps Bond Market for Vaccine Expenses (10:55 a.m. NY)Pfizer Inc. is tapping the U.S. investment-grade market with a sustainability bond that will help fund Covid-19 vaccine expenses, according to a person familiar with the matter.The note, due in 2031, may yield 0.75 percentage points above Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.Proceeds from the sale are marked for research and development expenses and the manufacturing and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. The New York-based pharmaceutical company sees the vaccine bringing in $33.5 billion of revenue this year, which would make it one of the top-selling medicines ever."
"Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine sales are expected to reach $74 billion through next year, excluding Germany and Belgium, 17% more than previous estimates, according to Ronny Gal, a Sanford Bernstein pharmaceuticals analyst."

"PFE is where it was in 1999, in fact a little below. It may be a great company, but it's been a truly terrible, indeed, an appalling investment for many, many thousands of investors. A recent strong move has been followed by the ""death by a thousand cuts"" that PFE has reliably delivered to investors for more than two decades.In March 2020, I though to move from PFE [dead then for 21 years] into #$%$ Sporting Goods, a stock I had followed for some time. I then re-thought: with COVID coming, PFE might finally deliver, but no one would want sporting equipment as everyone might remain indoors. PFE was then about 36; #$%$ had fallen to 17 from the 40's.Today, PFE is 45 and #$%$ is 140, with a 21% dividend boost and a $5.50 special declared. First thoughts are very often best thoughts.PFE, with its wretched management, will remain where it is [36-46], I fear, while other companies whose stocks were in the 50's in 1999 are well over 100 or 200 today. some having split perhaps more than once. Unless investors see a clear, long-term uptrend in PFE's earnings, with a management committed to growth and not personal enrichment, PFE's stock price will remain ""bound in shallows and in miseries"". Shakespeare was right. There is a ""tide in the affairs of men"". I submit that that tide extends to the destiny of stock prices, certainly to PFE's."

The day-trading crowd sold off more positions than they bought in Moderna and BioNTech.It marks a sharp change in fortunes. Both Moderna and BioNTech have amassed triple digit gains this year, a rally the nearly $280 billion-valued Pfizer missed out on with a scant 34% gain, despite being the first -- along with BioNTech -- to win authorization for a Covid shot in the U.S. The U.S. announced today that it would start offering booster shots to the already vaccinated in September.As Pfizer rallies, BioNTech has tumbled more than 18% from a record high reached on Aug. 9, while Moderna is down roughly 18% from its zenith. All three stocks slumped today, with Pfizer reversing early gains to close down 2.2%.Pfizer’s stock now trades at about an 8% premium to the average analyst price target, compared to more than 30% for Moderna and 18% for BioNTech.The recent closing of the gap may not spell the end of the rally.

Pfizer Working On Specialized Vaccine Targeting COVID-19 Delta Variant: CEO
"No one is talking about the Pill that PFE has in clinical stage ll. If given approval by end of year, this will be a game changer to developing countries with limited distribution networks. The WHO and Western Govts will help to finance. The Pill has the ""potential"" to add 44B to the ir bottom line in 2022."

"Will $PFE pay $20 for TRIL? Let's go! Also, PFE eyeing ACRX? ACRX mentioned in this recent article!""Prefilled Syringes Market Size Worth USD 9.0 Billion by 2027 at 9.0% CAGR""Prefilled Syringes Market Scope:In recent years, the medical business has grown at a quick pace, which has aided in the enormous rise of the prefilled syringes market. Furthermore, as the pharmaceutical industry seeks innovative and more effective techniques for unit dose distribution, the demand for convenient drug delivery systems is giving rise to the growth of the prefilled syringes market. Prefilled vials improve patient safety by lowering the risk of accidental needle sticking and harmful product exposure that can occur while drawing medication from vials. Prefilled syringes can also help eliminate dosing errors and improve patient compliance by pre-measuring dosage. Unlike vials, which are overfilled by as much as 20-30% to allow for potential waste, prefilled syringes can completely eliminate the need for manufacturers to overfill.Market Drivers:The rising demand for prefilled syringes can be linked to a variety of factors, including technological advancements, the prevalence of chronic conditions, needle-stick or other government regulations, and self-injecting or adopting devices. With the expanding number of biosimilars and biologics in the pharmaceuticals industry, healthcare professionals and patients are becoming more aware of the benefits of prefilled syringes.COVID 19 Analysis:The COVID 19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on the market for prefilled syringes. It had a short-term impact on the supply chain and the drug production process, which influenced the market. HCPs have evolved various approaches to give the care to minimize the spread of COVID 19 and comply with regulations. To lessen the risk of needle-stick injuries, demand for prefilled syringes grew far faster than that for glass ampoules. To satisfy the demand for COVID 19 vaccination, producers are boosting their production capacity. Recently, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc has agreed to offer Laboratoire Aguettant a license to market Dzuveo in Europe in exchange for two prefilled syringe product candidates in the United States. Aguettant will have the right to market Dzuveo in Europe under the terms of the Dzuveo licensing deal. AcelRx will receive up to $55 million in up-front and sales-based milestone payments, as well as revenue sharing payments ranging from 35% to 45% of net sales."

Announced yesterday - Isreal extends boosters to all people 12+…..other countries will follow. Studies show that booster both extends and improves protection from serious illness on all variants so far including Delta.
"Israeli tv reported today that their vaccine “passports” expire at six months. Also that everyone in Israel who is 12 and over is eligible for a booster shot now.India gave over ten (10) million vaccination shots yesterday. Source: Israeli tv.Six months is the cutoff for protection-we need a booster after this. And, India considering the population difference is four times more efficient than the U. S.We all need boosters at six months. Pfizer and Moderna.I had mine on Friday and encourage everyone reading this to have a third shot also.PFE is saving lives. Six months."
All those who claim that the Pfizer product being injected right now was approved rather than Comirnaty. Please prove it.
The only good news for today GLD MRK we’re also down today when I see that I don’t feel that bad but I just don’t get it PFE away ripping and roaring for 2 months before Earnings than they leak the news after market of full approval after Hrs on a Friday giving the shorts plenty of time to bring it down something got to give soon this company flush with money and vaccine orders let see what happens in the next couple of weeks
"Yesterday's comment and an update regarding it. See the update below comment!!!!I was disappointed that PFE closed near the low of the day. The chart pattern is still intact with some caveats. PFE needs to find a bottom no lower than $48.75 on a closing basis and rally up from there to start forming a new bull pennant or flag between $49.17 and $51.84.A rally up from here to a new high would add to the existing flagpole. We did not hit my minimum price objective today, but we did come within 29 cents. For all practical purposes, 29 cents is a pencil width measuring error on a chart.A major sell off tomorrow below $47.30 will do major damage to the existing chart pattern.Those of you who didn’t sell today, might consider raising your stop loss to at least $47.30. If you’re a long term investor, then never mind.Today's Closing Update:As noted yesterday: The key support levels are $48.30, $48.64 and $48.75. This morning we tested $48.30 with a low trade of the day occurring shortly after the open at $48.26. Intraday, $48.30 held and I recommended a close at or above $48.75 for today. $48.75 held as we closed at $48.80. We can test these key support levels again tomorrow on an intraday basis, but by tomorrow it will be preferable to close above $49 with a high trade of the day in the mid $50 range to preserve the formation of a bull pennant or flag. Since mid July, there have only been 5 down trading days on PFE, excluding yesterday and today. PFE needs to reduce it overbought condition on the RSI, MACD and Fast Stochastics. The last two downs days have helped ease the overbought condition. Some more sideways to slight up trading days will further ease the overbought condition of the stock. In other words, PFE needs to take a bit of a breather from its torrid pace of the past month. Forming the next pennant or flag, if it comes to fruition and the verdict is still out, is part of the consolidation process.Tomorrow is another day and we will see what it brings. Another update will be forthcoming before or shortly after tomorrow's open."
"Just to keep things in proper perspective, regardless of what shorts or bears try to have you thinking, you’re investment in PFE is protected by the yield from the dividends, plus the likelihood that with patience, the company will continue to grow and with the huge cash position, they will buy other companies. Use your own judgment and ignore the noise."

"PFE is down because a huge wave of Trump supporters want to defeat the value of the vaccine: they short the stock. It is more than not being vaccinated. It is actually bankrupting the vaccine manufacturers which in their sick minds represents a kind of victory.Remember that PFE invested it’s own $1.5 billion. They did not take Trump’s money. The result is that PFE is the prime target of them.But their efforts are short lived: emergency rooms around the country are tragically stuffed with the unvaccinated. Eventually they all will have to be vaccinated. Without the vaccines they literally risk their lives.PFE will recover and, in time, reach another new high. Many whi shorted it will be laying on a gurney in an emergency room hallway somewhere wishing they had never heard of Trump.And that they had been vaccinated."

We need some positive media to bring this back to life. Maybe PFE needs a vaccine against shorts!!?

The target price of PFE within one year is expected to increase by multiples."
"If you've got 10 YEARS to wait.... PFuczer is the CON for you !!!Looking at the Pfizer stock split history from start to finish, an original position size of 1000 shares would have turned into 50592 today. It only took TEN YEARS !"
Pfizer is 10 times the technical ability of Moderna and as a matter of fact any competitors....
"The current estimate does not include the 25% price increase of the vaccine and the third booster shot at all. This year's EPS will be raised to $4.5 to $5, and the EPS growth rate in the next three years will be much higher than 25% annually. The reasonable P/E is 25 times at lease."

PFE took more health from me in the past 4 days than COVID 19 virus!
I can't wait for my next booster I'm so excited!!
I think this may be down because they agreed to buy an unproven cancer vaccine producing company for over $2 Billion.
There should be something about booster shots in the news today or tomorrow. With the virus consuming the world at the moment and vaccine protection on a downward curve I don't see governments refusing to give booster shots. This will give a jump to all vaccine companies.
Do you self a favor? Get out and buy puts. First stop $45 and then $42. You can always buy back at lower price once dust settles.
Pfizer saves the world and the stock only barely reaches its new high after a 2+ decade lull. Now is the time the company needs a business leader to create shareholder value instead of just someone keen on creating drugs.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that JADE DARE (B7451050), a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 study, met its co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The study showed that abrocitinib was statistically superior compared to dupilumab in each evaluated efficacy measure and had a safety profile consistent with previous studies. The head-to-head study was designed to directly compare the efficacy of abrocitinib 200mg versus dupilumab 300mg, in adult participants on background topical therapy with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Abrocitinib 200mg was administered by once-daily oral tablet and dupilumab was administered by subcutaneous injection every other week following a 600mg induction dose.""The results from our first formal head-to-head trial for abrocitinib illustrate its potential for meaningful symptom relief for patients and further build upon the substantial body of data from the JADE development program,"" said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development.

We lift our 2021 EPS by $0.08 to $4.06 and keep our 2022 EPS estimate at $3.55. We also saw in the beginning of August, Israel starting to offer a PFE-Biontech booster vaccine to its population over 60. We think other countries might also follow suite, despite WHO's concerns for vaccine equity, due to the rising health risks posed by the Delta variant and diminishing protection of the vaccine over time, based on recent studies. We also expect to see a faster regulatory approval for the vaccine for younger children ages 5 to 11 due to increasing health concerns for this unvaccinated age group, and the rapidly spreading Delta variant amid the start of a new school year."
