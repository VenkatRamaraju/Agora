The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different streams of income that doesn't depend on the government especially with the current economy crisis around the world
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizing Pfizer (PFE)â€™s COVID-19 vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds
"November 2nd, 2021 earning release date for PFE.November 4th, 2021 ex-dividend for PFE."
Can someone explain how Pfe which has other products besides the covid vaccine not do well but Moderna which has one product be over $300.
"Share holders are waiting patiently for dividend increase. No more acquisitions needed, time to cut costs and reward share holders."
"Pfizer is one of the best investment opportunities at WALLSTREET.A bargain in comparison to its strong fundamentals and for the fact, that Pfizer has saved the world with its vaccine.New covid pill and new delta variant vaccines will come soon and will boost profits in future furthermore.A strongest buy.Sell massive overvalued Tesla and buy Pfizer instead, much saver investment and with target 60 usd Minimum."
Does PFE have any blockbusters in the pipeline that will off set those going off patent?
GOOD TIME FOR A SQUEEZE WITH 54 MIL + SHORTED
"Adding on Monday. 40 to 50 billion dollar yearly profit. With Market cap 280 billion it is too undervalued. Booster shot, kid vaccine and covid prevention oral pill will make stock price 60+"
"earnings Tuesday? increase dividend, raise guidance, buyback stock!! $50 very soon!!"
Yes I see pfe stock move up now get in past because next week is a good earning
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Morin program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns."
Would feel better with above Tues Oct 26 Intraday High of $43.76 and a magical move to 43.95-44 even after hoursMight be stretching it but Tues is Earnings Release BEFORE OPENHope it can trade somewhere on the plus side as Merck(but with analyst price target upgrades) after earnings release yesterdayNo real earnings surprise as expectations are 1.07-1.08 about 11% over last year's Qtr 3 earningsand 4.08-4.10 for the yearat 13X earnings we could see 52?Merck did surprise the street which had 1.55 and 1.75 reported with Price Target Upgrades
just reported the FDA may clear PFE for the covid vaccine for children by days end. if that happens this should go up fast
"Watched Bourla on Yahoo podcast.He seems capable of executing the business well but he is not very good at promoting the stock.When asked about PFE developing an oral therapeutic for covid,he used phrases like ""Ive got my fingers crossed"" and ,I paraphrase,""I have been disappointed many times in the past"".Not very uplifting is it?"
With all the good news on Pfizer the last couple of days. Approval of the booster shots. Approval from advisory group for vaccines for 5-11. This stock still can't hold gains. It sure looks like it want to turn red and circle the toilet bowl. YET AGAIN!!!!
"PFE High of 43.83 AFTER HOURSThis ain't Moderna,BNTX or VAX with gargantuan moves as the song says>>>Should I Stay or Should I go??Tough call before earnings releaseGood Luck To All"
The whole word is buying billions of pfe vaccines and the stock dont move
"Good news starting to come in for pfe. FDA approval of covid shot for 5 to 11 y.o., annalysts raising earnings estimates.Now company needs to raise guidance and raise dividend."
