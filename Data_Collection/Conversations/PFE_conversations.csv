The Green Pfizer is back
"Shorts go ahead and cover for the day, news article coming out stating no young adults died after reporting heart inflammation following Covid shots-New England Journal of medicine says myocarditis is high for those infected with Covid-19- this is news that will also help the up and coming approval of Children.Made your money today, cover over last 30 minutes of trading day."
"The study found in two analyses that people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher."
"Most stocks in red today, Pfizer is green"
There should be something about booster shots in the news today or tomorrow. With the virus consuming the world at the moment and vaccine protection on a downward curve I don't see governments refusing to give booster shots. This will give a jump to all vaccine companies.
I’m giving my support to Pfizer because saved the life of my grandparents and family
"Shorts, your time will soon be up. Pfizer has so much going for it now. It’s a bargain at this price. They are staying one step ahead by investing in a oral treatment and a enhanced vaccine to protect against new variants.Buy and hold! Don’t let the shorts manipulate you. Buy the dips and hold. Time for the retail investors to take control here and do their part. This stock won’t be held down for much longer. To the moon!"
Big institutions are buying back after they shook y'all weak hands out.This stock will be back to $50 soon.
"Israeli tv reported today that their vaccine “passports” expire at six months. Also that everyone in Israel who is 12 and over is eligible for a booster shot now.India gave over ten (10) million vaccination shots yesterday. Source: Israeli tv.Six months is the cutoff for protection-we need a booster after this. And, India considering the population difference is four times more efficient than the U. S.We all need boosters at six months. Pfizer and Moderna.I had mine on Friday and encourage everyone reading this to have a third shot also.PFE is saving lives. Six months."
"pfe is experiencing an unexpected windfall of many billions of dollars. Even for a company large as pfe, this is serious money that will push up pps."
Israeli data released today “show that Covid 19 boosters work at curbing severe cases”. Ten fold effective.Israel is now giving boosters to everyone over 12 years old.
"Pfizer is the world leader in the best drugs for humankind.""Pfizer Announces Phase 3 JADE DARE Trial Met Co-Primary And Key Secondary Endpoints6:45 am ET August 30, 2021 (Benzinga) Print-JADE DARE trial met co-primary and key secondary endpoints and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies-Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that JADE DARE (B7451050), a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 study, met its co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The study showed that abrocitinib was statistically superior compared to dupilumab in each evaluated efficacy measure and had a safety profile consistent with previous studies. The head-to-head study was designed to directly compare the efficacy of abrocitinib 200mg versus dupilumab 300mg, in adult participants on background topical therapy with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Abrocitinib 200mg was administered by once-daily oral tablet and dupilumab was administered by subcutaneous injection every other week following a 600mg induction dose.""The results from our first formal head-to-head trial for abrocitinib illustrate its potential for meaningful symptom relief for patients and further build upon the substantial body of data from the JADE development program,"" said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We're pleased that the study findings show the potential impact abrocitinib could have to help people living with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in reducing their itch significantly and in achieving near complete skin clearance.""""PFE is making billion of dollar per year. PFE = $200 value."
PFE is not a one drug company. It'll do well with/without COVID vaccine.
"Covid cases look like they will be 350% higher than last year, so horrible but will probably make Pfizer bounce back"
"More and more vaccines to be sold, more and more money that Pfizer will make."
we are only $3 higher than we were at Nov. 1 2018 before covidlost $5 last week this stock is an underachiever never goes up always between 40 -50
"Reuters: ""Two die in Japan after receiving Moderna Covid-19 shots that were among lots later suspended following the discovery of contaminants"". Huh, for my vaccines I'll stick with Pfizer.....The tried and true, 172 year old company."
"Pfizer-Data from trial of booster shots will be available late Sept-Oct will submit data next month on children ages 5-11; may apply for emergency use in October .Americans who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines should get a booster shot eight months after their second vaccine dose, federal health officials said. The boosters will be available beginning Sept. 20, if the Food and Drug Administration agrees to the plan."
"PFE is a money machine with boosters, approval of vaccine for under 12 year olds coming, and 75% of the world still needing vaccinated, its a no brainer. The U.S. and Europe will step up to vaccinate everyone in the entire world or this thing will keep mutating. Thanks to Pfizer for getting these vaccines out. Get vaccinated."
We are still far away from getting rid of COVID-19 virus epidemics . More vaccination of COVID-19 is needed. Booster shot is needed. and PFE and BNT is the only vaccine got approval by FDA.
Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers mentioned Pfizer

"Good job all! Let’s get this above 50. More shares for us. Less shares for the shorts.

"Shares of Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna dipped following highly unusual reports of deaths in people who had received the vaccines."
Good news after good news and still the stock drops.
This is a redo of when Pfizer first announced they had a vaccine. Stock was driven down and I bought on the way down. I will do the same again. Pfizer will make new highs at some point.
PFE will sell all the vaccines they can make for next 3 yrs - plus the antiviral pill for those unvaccinated that are in hospital/ICU…..do you really think Pfizer won’t be way higher in 6 months?
Announced yesterday - Isreal extends boosters to all people 12+…..other countries will follow. Studies show that booster both extends and improves protection from serious illness on all variants so far including Delta.
Governments have no choice but to go for booster shots in an attempt to control the virus & get their economies going again. Moderna recent batch contamination only adds to the urgency of buying Pfizer vaccine. With the Delta variant hitting younger people Pfizer will get approval for jabs for the children soon. COVID unfortunately is her to stay with mankind for the foreseeable future.
Kids vaccine application submitted. Approval likely within 3 weeks.Brazil manufacturing deal for annual 100 million dosesSwiss ordered 14 million booster dosesThailand ordered 35 million dosesHonduras ordered 2.4 million doses in addition to 4.4 million ordered earlierDeal with S KoreaAll these news in past five days has been ignored by the market so far. Is a reversal coming?
