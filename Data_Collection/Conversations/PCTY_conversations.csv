"PCTY on downwards momentum for whatever reason has me interested in getting back in, but I think it might have a ways down to go. Maybe a dip under $100 would be a great entry point. Time will tell. Any news or updates anyone can share would be much appreciated."

2 cent miss????
Another solid quarter.
My tax accountant wants me to take my $OESX puts as losses to offset obscene gains on $PCTY this year. While they can’t offset all the gains (130%) it does help. I apparently can’t go short again immediately so I am probably out of the $OESX game for awhile. I know my position is appropriate but the tax losses provide an immediate return. Mixed feelings about selling the puts.

Per article-the reason for the sell off is a reduction in profit margin-BY.01%!!!!!. tHE MARGIN IS THE SAME AS LAST YEAR BUT JUST THAT MUCH LESS THEN EXPECTED THIS YEAR. THE COM[PANY UP SALES AND PROFITS FOR THIS YEAR AFTER BEATING LAST YEAR BY ALMOST 50%. This is how hedgies make money on these growth momentum stocks. They sold and then shorted first thing this morning trying to take out long shares so they can buy it lower and make profit on both sides of the trade. turn the computer off and go do something else. Otherwise you are going to give your shares away......1 tenth of 1% miss on earnings is worth a 12% sell off......
"Well, as I thought we hit $155 on Thursday! even $156.What a week despite the fact that it was only four trading days.From a low of $137.77 on Monday to a high of $156 on Thursday. Over $18 in less than four days.I think we'll hit $165 this coming week. We can dream of $170."
is this a good time to step in ?

"Very happy with my investment here, was thinking of taking some off going into earnings but glad I didn't."
I'd love to have 3% growth with break-even margins and trade at 35x sales....

By my calculation actual revenue growth around 4%...Seems a bit expensive at 30x sales with 5% margins...

"Paylocity is having a great 2016! “Paylocity ended a record-setting fiscal year with a very strong fourth quarter highlighted by total revenue growth of 50% and recurring revenue growth of 51%, driven by strong sales and operational execution,” said Steve Beauchamp, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paylocity. “The 51% total revenue growth in fiscal year 2016 was a record for Paylocity, and was a result of our strong commitment to customer service, outstanding performance by our sales team and a continued focus on investment in product development.”"

Feels like PCTY could have a big week. It’s been consolidating under its all time high for a few days. Friday the action the so strong. The market had a really bad day but PCTY refused to go down. I believe PCTY will hit $155 this week if the market is good.
"Funny how this stock drops $3 on 5,000 shares traded. It doesn't take much to move this stock. Someone is having a lot of fun trying to shake out weak holders.Drop the stock $3 by selling 5,000 shares then buy 200,000 shares at the lower price.Don't be fooled, the big money is not selling here. Watch the volume with every move up or down."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"One more thing-the reason for the 1 tenth of 1% margin reduction-lower interest rates. The interest they received on their huge cash float dropped like everybody else-that is the reason for the 1 tenth of 1% margin drop-again, per the hedgies you are expected to believe that is worth a 12% haircut AFTER the company actually upped all of their numbers for the rest of the year after beating last year by 50%."
