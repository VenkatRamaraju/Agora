is this a good time to step in ?
"One more thing-the reason for the 1 tenth of 1% margin reduction-lower interest rates. The interest they received on their huge cash float dropped like everybody else-that is the reason for the 1 tenth of 1% margin drop-again, per the hedgies you are expected to believe that is worth a 12% haircut AFTER the company actually upped all of their numbers for the rest of the year after beating last year by 50%."
"I really want to be CEO of a SaaS company with zero growth, negative margins, and trading at 60x sales. Wow."
Per article-the reason for the sell off is a reduction in profit margin-BY.01%!!!!!. tHE MARGIN IS THE SAME AS LAST YEAR BUT JUST THAT MUCH LESS THEN EXPECTED THIS YEAR. THE COM[PANY UP SALES AND PROFITS FOR THIS YEAR AFTER BEATING LAST YEAR BY ALMOST 50%. This is how hedgies make money on these growth momentum stocks. They sold and then shorted first thing this morning trying to take out long shares so they can buy it lower and make profit on both sides of the trade. turn the computer off and go do something else. Otherwise you are going to give your shares away......1 tenth of 1% miss on earnings is worth a 12% sell off......
Should recover rather quick IMO.
"$170 by mid July. This stock has the ability to move by $10 in a single day. Once we clear the all time high, there will be a lot of buyers noticing"
"PCTY on downwards momentum for whatever reason has me interested in getting back in, but I think it might have a ways down to go. Maybe a dip under $100 would be a great entry point. Time will tell. Any news or updates anyone can share would be much appreciated."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
52-week high possible this afternoon. Despite a really bad day on Monday we still have a shot at $155 tomorrow before the long weekend.
Bought in at $85.91 on 4/23/20 and am celebrating my first double. Great company doing payroll and more the right way.
Feels like PCTY could have a big week. It’s been consolidating under its all time high for a few days. Friday the action the so strong. The market had a really bad day but PCTY refused to go down. I believe PCTY will hit $155 this week if the market is good.

Latest price action looks like this could actually go back to $150.00 this summer - or maybe before.

Paylocity Holding reached an all time high at 302.91
All time high!!! Great volume 60% below average!!! They are fighting over it!!!!
"PCTY keeps putting together solid quarters but without anything too impressive. The stock has a lot of haters, but not the longs. Should see excellent growth once COVID goes away. I have a $300 one year price target."
I'd love to have 3% growth with break-even margins and trade at 35x sales....
$130 and counting... at this pace we'll be at record highs before the summer is over. Staying long on Paylocity.
300 shrs @ 89. Can't decide if next EP will beat or not. Price action recently seems to indicate beat. But missed last years earnings this Q.
