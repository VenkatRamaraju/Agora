MDT was just put on Citi's focus list.
"MDT CEO on CNBC Mad Money with Cramer, today 10/12"
"Cash $10BB, DEBTS $25BB, over valued!"
"Way oversold, now it sitting at its 200 day MA."
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP filled and going long !!!
Buy at this crazy discount!
25% upside at current price w $149 target & 2% dividend!!!! Great opportunity!!!!
"MDT weakness is probably due to pending legislation that will specifically hurt pharma but not directly device makers. Although there could be another device tax like the 2.3% for the Affordable Care Act. I'm more interested in where MDT market cap will be a year from now. I think it will be north of today but I also expect some big market pullbacks in the next year, maybe soon."
"It looks to be a tuff day for medical device stocks given that Stryker is indicated to open down 2% - 3% in reaction to their earnings report after the bell last night. I'm prepared to buy on a swoon. I already have a big % of my retirement account and portfolio account in MDT plc, as well as having about 25% cash at this point. If the market tanks and MDT dips enough I would add. I do expect to see a good earnings report and outlook. A wild card would be the impact, if any, and if material on MDT inventory conversion due to chip shortages. I remember well the Diabetes division woes when it suddenly, way before expected, an approved ""G"" device - could have been the 740G -- the first with an advanced technology to keep Type 1 in range based on MDT's feedback loop. They could manufacture the devices but could not source the sensors without building a manufacturing facility to produce them which delayed the new device & tech by 6-9 months. The Diabetes segment hasn't been able to catch up since then. Hopefully the new 780G unit parts will not be filling up storage space waiting for chips. MDT is in a different space than AAPL which just missed on Rev & EPS - $6 bil of revenue deferred due to chip shortages they said. Hopefully the G sensor capacity lesson prompted Omar to have key MDT supply chains subject to on-going analysis and review. Good Luck..."
Record Earnings announced a few weeks and ago and now down 10%.
Target Price $148-$150 per Wall St Journal and NASDAQ site analysts!! Buy the dip!!!!
"I see Jeff Gundlach is featured on Yahoo predicting that the dollar loses value due to all of the new dollar creation to fund Fed spending. If the dollar does weaken against other currencies, it will pump up MDT's Operating EPS when foreign earnings are translated into more dollars. That applies to all US multinationals and foreign multinationals like MDT who trade on the US exchanges and whose most important financial statements are expressed in dollars. Although many MDT shareholders view results in Euro. Inflation is a tuff addition to a falling dollar, MDT will hopefully have the pricing power to pass it along to consumers like everyone will try to do."
"I don't know what is going on, but shares are down huge premarket today."
After hours Friday volume 269.9k. Down 4.95. Not just a few shares. Could not find any news.
I really like MDT but am hesitant to get in now at current valuation. What's a good entry?
"I added on the dip. The fall seems to be from MDT not arguing against an independent safety board which obviously has standing to be able to recommend the full study be done instead of curtailing it because of the positive results so far into the study. If you are going to have a problem that's a good one to have, because there is nothing you can do about it unless it's unreasonable. So I added 100 shares to my pile. MDT said it would have no impact on FY22 EPS which is this year ending 4/30/22. MDT also said the study size should be reached before the end of this fiscal year ending 4/22. Sounds like a 6 month delay, but I could be off based on how you read the quote and news clip. If it was unreasonable MDT would probably argue against it. But you can't be aggressive because of enhanced risk if something does go wrong. They stated they already have real data for 3000 people which it appears makes this only a question of time and not efficacy"
"MDT is one of Bank America top picks for Q4:Bank of America names its top U.S. Idea for Q4 as it looks for year-end opportunities for investors.""As we head into year-end off of a volatile third quarter, our strategy teams think the US continues to be the destination for investors because of key advantages in productivity, population, profits & policy,"" updates the firm.The list of high-conviction, short-term ideas includes 8 Buy-rated stocks and 2 Underperform-rated stocks.Bank of America sees quick upside for APA Corp (NASDAQ:APA), CNH Industrial NV (NYSE:CNHI), East West Bancorp (NASDAQ:EWBC), Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR), Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER).Bank of America sees downside risk for AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM)."
"Medtronic acquired Covidien in 2015, and moved its headquarter to Ireland to reduce corporate taxes. Ireland’s corporate tax is only 12.5%. Ireland has agreed on the global tax agreement. It will raise its corporate tax to 15%, which greatly impact Medtronic’s earnings."
Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has lost ~4.7% in the post-market after a company announcement indicated a potential delay in its clinical program for Symplicity Renal Denervation System.
Does anyone have information on the robotic surgery system that it’s being developed by MDT?
"A greatly managed company with deservedly upward trend (yrly, 6m, 3m, 5 day), even on a red day like today this stk is green. A great long term investment."
This is total bull.. All medical device stocks are up... See this....
EX Dividend is in 2 days 9/23. GLTA
"Does MDT ever go up? Wow, stock is a falling knife for no reason.May hit $80 before its bottom is in...."
i believe hugo system.
Trade your position for ABT
Good day -- good earnings report -- nice market reception.The stock has been volatile of late -- about an 11 point trading range in the last two weeks. Longer term the good results should increase the steady bid from more fund accumulation.
"Price Target CUT by Wellsfargo this morning....thats main reason why it's down.""Analysts at Wells Fargo cut their price target on the medical device maker to $144 a share from $151, while maintaining an overweight rating on the stock. Medtronic ( MDT ) has an average investment rating of outperform among analysts polled by Capital IQ, with a price target range of $129 to $155""."
leading disruptive medical device stock w/ mamy needed products... surgeries and treatments will rise significantly rest of year and thereafter
down 5% afterhours ?
MD is a safe bet.
Agreed! Well managed and constant performer. I'm long on this!
Was great all day what’s the hell AH??
Down 5.5% on heavy volume (already traded 2x daily volume). This is being sold by hedge finds and possible shorting for a delay in Symplicity RDS? The drop is unwarranted as the delay is only until H2-2022. Im a buyer here so keep them coming.
"It looked like a big market reaction to a clinical trial board not curtailing a study early. I looked thru the last presentation the CEO made at the Goldman Sachs conference and renal denervation was not highlighted in the slide presentation. I have to wonder how expectations got built up to the level where a delay of up to a year would shave $7 off the price. The recall was another negative, I'd like to know why a 12 month delay in FDA approval of the procedure whacked the stock by 5%. I bought a little more at $121.20. Earnings coming up in about a month should be good and we should hear more about the procedure & approvals."
MDT hits new high at $132.78!The trading day has just begun.
"Very positive news.. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is in advanced talks to acquire Israeli startup Triple Jump for $300M, Calcalist reported on Sunday.The U.S medical device maker had already made an investment in Triple Jump in 2015 with an option to acquire it. Founded in 2015, Triple Jump is developing a small insulin pump patch with mobile connectivity.A deal is likely to further expand Medtronic’s (MDT) market presence in diabetes care"
A couple of weeks ago I was debating between MDT and NUE Nucor. Glad I picked up NUE and held back adding MDT. NUE up almost 16 points.
Time to buy more!!!!
MDT is behaving badly and very weak past couple of weeks. Slowdown may be affecting sales and it looks like not enough buyers to maintain these levels. May drop another 10% before basing.
