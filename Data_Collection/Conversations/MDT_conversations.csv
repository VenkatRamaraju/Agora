"C&P from the Jeffereys Converence today - first section:Karen ParkhillThank you, Raj. Happy to be here.Question-and-Answer SessionQ - Rajbir DenhoyGreat. Yes. I wanted to maybe start with just exploring several issues that came up on the last earnings call, which I think was just a week before last. Seems like a long time ago, but it's just two weeks ago. Then we can transition to the pipeline and sort of other aspects of the story.Maybe at a high level, you chose not to give guidance, which a lot of companies didn't do, but you did give us some very substantial guidepost, I think, in the way to kind of model the company and think about the next 12 months. And so there was quite a few questions, though, that came out on the revenue outlook. And you gave some quantitative or qualitative guidance, I should say, around next quarter being potentially lower than the previous quarters, the first quarter being down on the fourth quarter. But also some of the commentary you gave around how different geographies were performing suggested that maybe that was a conservative outlook. And so is there anything maybe you want to add to that or kind of ground us in what you're really seeing right now?Karen ParkhillYes. No, thanks for the question, Raj. We are really encouraged by the things that we have seen in the month of May. Some recoveries, particularly across our cardio business and in the U.S. and a little bit earlier than we had initially anticipated. So we're encouraged by that, and we talked about on our earnings call some of the early and gradual recovery that we're seeing in China and in Western Europe. And that has remained. Even though 1.5 weeks has passed since our earnings call, those trends are still there.It's true that we did say that we expect our first quarter to be potentially modestly worse than our fourth quarter because of the full quarter impact. And we really didn't want to get ahead of ourselves on some of the early trends we're seeing because early trends don't necessarily make a full quarter. And we knew that we had some patient backlog for some procedures that we were seeing come back relatively quickly. But we know in certain procedures, it takes time to build up the backlog once you've gotten through that backlog. And in certain cases, we could see some strong recovery, a little bit of a dip, followed by recovery again. And so it was too early to make any broader calls than that.But clearly, we're encouraged. And if the quarter continues to play out based on the early trends that we've seen in this quarter, we'll do a little bit better than what we said. But at this stage, again, too early to call the quarter.Rajbir DenhoyNo. Completely makes sense. And you gave us a little bit on this, but in terms of the pace of the recovery and what you're seeing, other than, obviously, with daily sales volumes, which we don't want to get into that pattern of updating on that frequency, but are there other things that you're seeing, conversations with hospitals, surgery schedules building, any other anecdotes you can point to in terms of how the recovery is shaping up?Karen ParkhillYes. And clearly, you talk about daily sales. We're watching daily sales. We're watching weekly sales. But clearly, you see ups and downs in those, and so they don't necessarily make a trend. But we're encouraged by the fact that hospitals, particularly in the U.S., do want to get back to having some of our more elective procedures more quickly. They need it from their financial stability perspective. And so they're anxious to bring those back. We are prepared and anxious and ready to help them. Our sales teams are fully equipped with the right PP&E. We hope to be one of the first vendors that is back in the hospitals across the country and across the world actually because we are ready, we are prepared. We are helping our customers with protocols and standards and procedures in place. And so we're building stronger customer relationships as we come out. And we're ready to help make this recovery as fast as it can be.Rajbir DenhoyGreat. Just two more questions on the revenue side, and we can talk a little bit about the margin picture. The other kind of guidepost you gave us was that you expected the fourth quarter of this year -- of this fiscal year to be up on a 2-year stack basis, actually show positive growth, which would imply something around 25%, perhaps 30% sort of growth. So maybe just -- is that the right way to think about that? Are we looking for that level of growth in the fourth quarter of this year?Karen ParkhillOur likely scenario does indicate that. And when you think about it, it's going to be substantial growth if we're back to more normal levels off of a very low base in the prior year fourth quarter. So just given that, it needs to be high growth. And so that's why we've chosen to look at it on a stacked basis because neither year -- neither fourth quarter is normal..."

"It looks to be a tuff day for medical device stocks given that Stryker is indicated to open down 2% - 3% in reaction to their earnings report after the bell last night. I'm prepared to buy on a swoon. I already have a big % of my retirement account and portfolio account in MDT plc, as well as having about 25% cash at this point. If the market tanks and MDT dips enough I would add. I do expect to see a good earnings report and outlook. A wild card would be the impact, if any, and if material on MDT inventory conversion due to chip shortages. I remember well the Diabetes division woes when it suddenly, way before expected, an approved ""G"" device - could have been the 740G -- the first with an advanced technology to keep Type 1 in range based on MDT's feedback loop. They could manufacture the devices but could not source the sensors without building a manufacturing facility to produce them which delayed the new device & tech by 6-9 months. The Diabetes segment hasn't been able to catch up since then. Hopefully the new 780G unit parts will not be filling up storage space waiting for chips. MDT is in a different space than AAPL which just missed on Rev & EPS - $6 bil of revenue deferred due to chip shortages they said. Hopefully the G sensor capacity lesson prompted Omar to have key MDT supply chains subject to on-going analysis and review. Good Luck..."
leading disruptive medical device stock w/ mamy needed products... surgeries and treatments will rise significantly rest of year and thereafter
"Price Target CUT by Wellsfargo this morning....thats main reason why it's down.""Analysts at Wells Fargo cut their price target on the medical device maker to $144 a share from $151, while maintaining an overweight rating on the stock. Medtronic ( MDT ) has an average investment rating of outperform among analysts polled by Capital IQ, with a price target range of $129 to $155""."
What do you think the chances are we hit $100? I love the company but would like to lock in some profits.
This is a fantastic re-opening stock. Much of the goods and services provided by MDT have been on the shelf collecting dust. This company is burning rubber out of the gate and is going to leap higher. I can't view it any other way.

"The March 15th peak has come and gone....... is the downhill slide over? (RSI at 24.25) I wonder if the recent rise in MDT is related to this little (forgotten?) news flash.....Published in MarketWatch, March 8th, 2019 at 4:49 PM;Medtronic PLC (MDT) said late Friday its board authorized a new plan to buy back up to $6 billion in shares. Prior to the new plan, the medical device company said it has $1.3 billion in share buyback authorization left in a $5 billion plan approved in June 2017.With authorization monies just waiting to be used, I would believe that the RSI has to be tempting them by now.....IMHO"
Nice earnings
It was a good report. The GAAP EPS being up so much at +22% yoy is probably due to debt refinance charges last year -- the costs to call the old debt and costs of replacement debt are excluded from operating EPS - like the $1.31 just reported but they are an expense against GAAP EPS. MDT needs to get revenue growth up to get a bigger P/E. They do expect 4%+ revenue growth for Q3 - Q4. Hopefully that momentum will carry into next yr.
MDT was just put on Citi's focus list.
"DUBLIN , March 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV), the first minimally invasive therapy created to treat patients with a specific type of congenital heart defect of the right ventricle (RV)"
I am looking forward to Sept. 25th (institutional investor day) when initial international sales models are expected. Canada continues to be an elusive market at the moment. The $DXCM acquisition of TypeZero is extremely bullish news for $TNDM. As insurance cycles in Q4 I’m looking for strong sales and perhaps an $MDT conversion rate please...Kim holy grail: UHC coverage —> $DXCM merger (?)
FYI......not reported anywhere in Yahoo Finance but on 11/20 Medtronic got their price target raised by 4 separate investment firms. The price targets all ranged from $118 to $125. Just sharing it here because Yahoo Finance is not really a professional investors site. GLTA
"Why is the market looking through everyone else's earnings and lack of guidance and giving them a pass and the stocks are going up on hope that demand will return. Why would someone think demand for Heart procedures, Spine or Pain management, etc won't return when they think demand for Travel or Oil or Clothing will return. The company is signaling how they feel about the future with a dividend raise."
Down 5.5% on heavy volume (already traded 2x daily volume). This is being sold by hedge finds and possible shorting for a delay in Symplicity RDS? The drop is unwarranted as the delay is only until H2-2022. Im a buyer here so keep them coming.
"Both Omar & Karen the CFO said they were looking for offsets to new US tax regs that will probably cost MDT about 2% this coming FY 2020 starting 5/1/19. An obvious offset was the refi and higher coupon paydown. This will create higher interest expense in Q4 for the premiums paid to call the debt but lower period interest expense starting Q1 of FY 2020. I have noticed a big pick up of after hours volumes in the stock. MDT has been trading heavily -- usually 500k shares or more -- usually 10%+ of daily volume. It does look like MDT is aggressively buying back its shares pursuant to the recent $6 B earmarked for buybacks. I looked at results for the last buyback authorization of $5 B -- there was a balance of $1.7 B after about 19 months so $3.3 B spent over 19 months or about $175 M per month. We won't find out until earnings are reported in May. Reducing the share count will be effective against increased tax expense but to be most effective share count needs to be reduced at the beginning of a period since the share count used to compute EPS is the weighted average of shares outstanding for the period.Using a $90 share price bogey, when MDT was spending $175 M per month they were buying about 1,944,000 per month. I would not be surprised to see the buyback numbers double during the current Q4."
Somebody please wake me up at $109/share for MDT. Thanks. Insiders STILL buying.
Best player in a growth industry with no signs of slowing down over the next 10 years. Buy and hold
"I see Jeff Gundlach is featured on Yahoo predicting that the dollar loses value due to all of the new dollar creation to fund Fed spending. If the dollar does weaken against other currencies, it will pump up MDT's Operating EPS when foreign earnings are translated into more dollars. That applies to all US multinationals and foreign multinationals like MDT who trade on the US exchanges and whose most important financial statements are expressed in dollars. Although many MDT shareholders view results in Euro. Inflation is a tuff addition to a falling dollar, MDT will hopefully have the pricing power to pass it along to consumers like everyone will try to do."
"The current analyst composite est on Yahoo is $1.06 EPS for Q4 compared to $1.54 last year. Under the circumstances of C-19 I think it looks pretty good. MDT must have had good sales in February going into April which must have been down big. The next Q is what will Q1 and FY 21 ending 4/30/21 look like. I have to assume that MDT will come in at or higher than the $1.06. In May of 2018 Mike Weinstein joined MDT in the CFO office as a Sr VP working on investor relations and corporate structure. He had been at Morgan Stanley as an analyst for 20 years and folled medical device makers. Since then the guidance MDT provides the analysts has resulted in actual EPS beating the composite est at + 2% - 5%. It's going to be interesting, let's see what happens."
i believe hugo system.
Closed at $12.06 which is 9 cents off the all time high. Hopefully we see good results on the morning of Nov 19 - next Tuesday morning. During the last 4 Q reports MDT has beaten between 4% to 6.8%. They probably target 4% - 5% with the strength opf the dollar tipping it to either side. I expect good results. MDT needs to get its revenue growth rate up to get a bigger p/e. I hope to see further reductions of SG&A ratio to revenue -- improved nicely Q2.
"Sorta good news for MDT within EW's earnings report - MDT seems to be taking TAVR share:""Chief Executive Michael Mussallem noted Edwards' transcatheter heart-valve replacement system, Sapien 3, recently proved superior to surgery over a yearlong study. TAVR, for short, is a method of replacing a faulty heart-valve using a catheter rather than resorting to open-heart surgery.""This marks a turning point in the advancement of a therapy that transforms the lives of patients suffering from aortic stenosis,"" he said in a written statement.During the first quarter, TAVR sales advanced 8% to $598 million. On an underlying basis, revenue from TAVR grew 10%. But the medical device company acknowledged Edwards grew at a lower rate than the estimated global TAVR procedure growth ""due to a modest year-over-year share decline.""Edwards challenges Medtronic (MDT) with a TAVR system. And Boston Scientific (BSX) also is nearing U.S. approval.Edwards Raises Adjusted Earnings OutlookFor the year, Edwards raised its adjusted earnings guidance by a nickel to $5.10-$5.35 per share, up from its prior forecast for $5.05-$5.30. At the midpoint, that was in line with analyst views for Edwards earnings of $5.22 per share."""
When does MDT determine dividend increase/decrease?
"Can't try to play this game day-to-day. Algos, high frequency traders, options , hedgers....and another 100 trading schemes control the daily movements. BUT.....the facts are the facts and those don't change. MDT beat on EPS, Revenue, raised guidance for the next quarter, are in the right ""macro environment"" (aging population), have an excellent product pipeline, are not affected by trade or interest rates. I am not going to worry about the price going down on a down market day. Too much going for this company. Go ahead drive it way down I got some dry powder to use."

"I added on the dip. The fall seems to be from MDT not arguing against an independent safety board which obviously has standing to be able to recommend the full study be done instead of curtailing it because of the positive results so far into the study. If you are going to have a problem that's a good one to have, because there is nothing you can do about it unless it's unreasonable. So I added 100 shares to my pile. MDT said it would have no impact on FY22 EPS which is this year ending 4/30/22. MDT also said the study size should be reached before the end of this fiscal year ending 4/22. Sounds like a 6 month delay, but I could be off based on how you read the quote and news clip. If it was unreasonable MDT would probably argue against it. But you can't be aggressive because of enhanced risk if something does go wrong. They stated they already have real data for 3000 people which it appears makes this only a question of time and not efficacy"
"The $1.40 drop Monday looked like it was probably due to news about the Mazor Ceo being investigated for insider trading on the news that MDT was going to make it's initial equity investment. It could also have been due in part to the news that the tax bill looked like it would be passed which would make US Corp tax rates 20% compared to 12% for Ireland. The Mazor Ceo's situation is vague but out there. It's at least a distraction and a general negative but could be minor on the impact to the MazorX system. As to the US tax rate going to 20% -- it will help MDT plc because the US subsidiary generates about 55% of revenue. Products like TVAR and mitral valve systems in pivotal trial, 670G and other promising new tech will continue to drive revenue in the US and MDT pays the same taxes as domestic corporations in the US. I believe MDT recently reported about a 17% tax rate which would include US taxes incurred. I did see that US medtech firms pay around 26% effective rate under the max 35% current scheme so medtech may go to the 20% level. So MDT would see a modest reduction. I believe during the last conference call the CFO projected 15% ahead but I don't know if that included a US rate reduction. MDT will still have a tax rate well below 20%. The first year 100% write off of depreciable assets with a 20 yr life or less for 5 years will probably make the investment commitments MDT make to Al Franken to get his support for the Covidien deal done will produce better US cash flow statements. And the 100% first yr drpr may prompt more of it."
"Just starting to research this, looking for opportunities. Did they just have a recall on some equipment in March and now another announced today? Looks like 11 instances that patients were hurt. Any concern for the company getting kicked around for a bit?"
"It looked like a big market reaction to a clinical trial board not curtailing a study early. I looked thru the last presentation the CEO made at the Goldman Sachs conference and renal denervation was not highlighted in the slide presentation. I have to wonder how expectations got built up to the level where a delay of up to a year would shave $7 off the price. The recall was another negative, I'd like to know why a 12 month delay in FDA approval of the procedure whacked the stock by 5%. I bought a little more at $121.20. Earnings coming up in about a month should be good and we should hear more about the procedure & approvals."
"...Yes, I was referring to US tax based, same sector investment alternatives like Stryker, Edwards, J&J, and so on. The key is that US corporations are taxed on global income less deductions for foreign tax paid. But the US can only tax foreign corporations on US revenues. To try and do otherwise would result in quick retaliation. MDT has been running around a 15% - 16% blended overall tax rate with the base US rate at 21% covering 53% of MDT's revenues. Taxes are complicated for multinationals but the back of an envelope shows MDT with a current positive gap of 5% - 5.5%. If the US corporate rate goes from 21% to 28% or up 7% it would raise MDT's overall blended rate by about 3.5% to 18.5% - 19% compared to 28%. The positive gap would then be 9% - 9.5% from the new base rate of 28%, up from the current 5% - 5.5% positive gap. This is why the inversion looks so good at this point. Because if rates do go up to 28% the positive gap for MDT will approach a dime on a dollar of global taxable income and that is a lot of cash flow that MDT will be able to reinvest in the business or payout to shareholders. Omar was a True Believer in the inversion and pushed it through in the face of direct opposition from President Obama resulting in the Treasury Sect. Jack Lew changing the rules for corporations trying to invert, for the sole purpose of stopping MDT from switching to Ireland. Omar was right."
I see nothing to account for the price drop today other than MDT has been drifting up and this could be profit taking - Stryker was down as well. MDT is up after hours + $.39 on 512k shares traded which is big for MDT - stay tuned.
"MDT had a good report but it does look like it will take better growth to pull the share price to $100. An EPS growth rate of 10% is good in a low rate world but it's not exciting. This year's Operating EPS target of $5.15 gives MDT a multiple of 16.5 on this year's earnings. In my view the stock probably has good downside protection at 15x or about $77.25. The current outlook will be adjusted by Investor Day next Tuesday June, 5. There will no doubt be impressive new products to talk about and If the market sees potential in robotics it will probably improve MDT's profile. It's a Buffett stock, he says he wants to own stocks who treat investors with reverence. I assume MDT's 50% of cash flow to investors qualifies MDT. I expect that robotics will be exciting but as with the 670G device we saw a delay for commercial sale of robotic surgical devices, except for Mazor. I'm sure they will get it right and I hope to hear good news on the 5th"
Does anyone have information on the robotic surgery system that it’s being developed by MDT?
Medtronic is backing the SPAC started by Intel chairman Omar Ishrak in the health technology sector. Its also setup with co-chief exec officers Jean Nehme who helped found AI startup Digital Surgery Ltd and then sold it to Medtronic & Joshua Fink who runs the investment firm Ophir Holdings LLC and is the son of BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink. I read about Digital Surgery wins ago and totally missed the boat on buying in before but bought into the SPAC since it just launched closer to the NAV. Looks interesting if anyone else wants to read up on it.
"Volume is modest. Expecting price flatening next couple of days as EE’s exercise options. Otherwise, slow and steady upward momentum. MDT is still in the top quadrant for its sector, a tool used by brokerage houses. Im playing the momentum."
"130,000 ventilators. Even if every company gets an order for 30k ventilators with average price rage of $30k will fetch $900 million. That is good size revenue increase"
"Does MDT ever go up? Wow, stock is a falling knife for no reason.May hit $80 before its bottom is in...."
Good day -- good earnings report -- nice market reception.The stock has been volatile of late -- about an 11 point trading range in the last two weeks. Longer term the good results should increase the steady bid from more fund accumulation.
"MDT CEO on CNBC Mad Money with Cramer, today 10/12"
down 5% afterhours ?
"Seems to me MDT's share price after it reports Q4 will in large part based on the success of tamping down C-19 in the US and the rest of the world. Hopefully elective surgery will come back in full force as C-19 goes down into controllable hot spots. If revenues are back on track for May then MDT may get a Mulligan for Q4 C-19 loss. It's going to be a sizable net loss - a cash loss against the apx $11 bil of cash & equivalents MDT had at Q3. So MDT has the balance sheet to withstand Q4 as long as most expected revenue layers back on from current orders. Stryker needs to show the same revenue pick up. I'm hopeful, I'm in a SE state that is opening up in the sunny southern vanguard. Wish us luck."
"Here is a 6/01/20 blurb on the software recall mentioned below. Nobody wants to see these field problems, except the PI attorneys, As with most of these, the public info comes quite a while after the problem surfaces -- this was recalled in Nov 2019. This one is relatively minor compared to the 670G recall:""Medtronic recalls StealthStation DBS softwareBy AuntMinnie.com staff writersJune 1, 2020 -- Device manufacturer Medtronic has recalled the autoregistration feature on its StealthStation DBS software used in deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures due to inaccuracies that could lead to serious harm to patients, according to a summary published June 1 by the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration (FDA).The recall was issued due to inaccuracies caused by minor patient movements during the software's autoregistration process when used with the company's NexFrame stereotactic imaging system and O-arm imaging system during a DBS procedure. These errors may not be detected by the surgeon or the device system, according to the FDA.""This may provide inaccurate registration data which could lead surgeons to inaccurately navigate lead placement during image guided DBS procedures,"" the FDA wrote in its recall information summary. ""This could result in serious or life-threatening patient harm.""The FDA classified the action as a class I recall -- its most serious type. A total of 33 medical device reports have been received by the FDA as of June. Of these, 22 were related to device malfunction and 11 were related to injuries, the FDA said.Medtronic sent urgent medical device correction letters on August 9, 2019, to the 54 affected customers, advising physicians to weigh the benefits against the risks of fiducial-based or fiducial-less registration methods, according to the FDA. It also provided new instructions.After the O-arm autoregistration step has been completed, but before using the StealthStation DBS software with the NexFrame stereotactic system and O-arm imaging system for intraoperative navigation, customers should do the following:Assess navigational accuracy by verifying the accuracy of the registration on several known anatomical landmarks, as described in the indications for use, before using the registration for navigation.Use the StealthMerge functionality in the software, as described in the indications for use, to compare the actual location of the cannula or lead with the surgical plan.Use the planning functionality in the software, as described in the indications for use, to compare the cannula with the planned trajectory. This can be accomplished by making an additional plan along the axis of the cannula to evaluate cannula position.Medtronic has also added instructions to the label and has produced an updated training program to inform physicians of the inaccuracies that resulted in the recall. The FDA said it's continuing to work with the company to determine if additional mitigation measures are needed."""
MDT was just mentioned on NBC news as being only one of 5 companies in the USA manufacturing ventilators. Only 7 more companies internationally.
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP filled and going long !!!
Was great all day what’s the hell AH??
"MDT weakness is probably due to pending legislation that will specifically hurt pharma but not directly device makers. Although there could be another device tax like the 2.3% for the Affordable Care Act. I'm more interested in where MDT market cap will be a year from now. I think it will be north of today but I also expect some big market pullbacks in the next year, maybe soon."

MDT hits new high at $132.78!The trading day has just begun.
"DUBLIN, April 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted de novo clearance for GI Genius intelligent endoscopy module in the United States.

"Thank you Motley Fool. $$$ for us.One quality stock that isn't among the most popular list on Robinhood is Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Fewer than 12,000 Robinhood users are holding shares of the Dividend Aristocrat. Despite paying a dividend yield of 2.5% (more than the S&P 500 average of 2%) and raising its payouts for more than four decades in a row, the healthcare stock hasn't attracted much interest from Robinhood investors. But that makes the boring old dividend stock an attractive buy for income investors -- it's not volatile and not on retail investors' radars.With profits in nine straight quarters and Medtronic selling various medical products, it's a safe investment to hold for the long term. It's down 19% so far in 2020 while the S&P has fallen by a more modest 4%.But a lot of that bearishness can likely be attributed to COVID-19. Dealing with the pandemic has been a priority for hospitals and that's resulted in the deferral of many medical procedures, which has hampered Medtronic's sales. The Irish company released its fourth-quarter results on May 21, which showed sales were down 26% year over year. However, Medtronic was still able to post a profit of $646 million, showing a lot of resiliency during a very difficult time for the healthcare industry.The key takeaway from all this is that investors should avoid chasing stocks that are popular on Robinhood and instead do their own due diligence when deciding on which companies to invest in. Buying a stock because it's hot is an easy way to add a lot of volatility to your portfolio. And odds are that isn't going to be a great strategy as the economy is in a recession and the world is dealing with a pandemic -- which could suggest that another market crash may not be too far away.Now's a time to exercise caution and stick with safe stocks like Medtronic that can help get your portfolio through this adversity."
"Just remember that if the ex-div date is 12/26, you have to own the stock on 12/25. Since that is Christmas day, you will need to own the stock by the 1:00 pm close on 12/24 (Christmas eve). Trading volume will be very lite in 12/24, so if you should try to buy it on (or before) Monday 12/23 if you want the dividend."
"I keep wondering why this stock does not do much. Since it changed over to Ireland and everyone who owned it had to pay tax on the capital gains, it has not done anything."

"Cash $10BB, DEBTS $25BB, over valued!"
"Nice to see a bid in for MDT. I have been impressed with core profitability which has allowed MDT to post positive earnings with revenue and gross margins depressed. MDT's tried and seasoned products have higher than average margin and cover a lot of SG&A. So that's a clarified fundamental that can now be attributed to MDT's established product portfolio. Mgt & BOD seem to have managed well given no reduction in ongoing R&D, the extra $337 mil of diabetes R&D added from the Blackstone Life Sciences fund, and the 7% dividend increase was a positive signal to look past C-19. MDT is a Buffet stock. Even if US tax rates go up it's on about 53% of revenue."
"Glad to see MDT stabilize. The 600 series pump resolution will have a financial liability part and a fix for the pumps. As to the financial liability it's for 1 death and about 2100 injuries. Most if not all of the pumps send data to MDT so that data will be important to understand the extent of the injuries. I assume MDT will try to settle quickly with strong offers to settle quickly and avoid a class action. MDT needs to pull out the stops on offers to retain its base. As to the fix, it looks simple per the MDT Nov 21 letter posted earlier. A stronger plastic or metal retaining ring seems to be the answer. There is nothing else wrong with the pumps. It may involve mailing out replacement rings or exchanging the pumps where the ring has already broken. I assume it's student body left to get this resolved because the population of patients has to continue with MDT because they want the pump for quality of life. MDT will probably facilitate those who are fed up and want to switch. So bottom line is it's going to cost MDT some cash but the diabetes technology is not in question it's a dumb materials mistake for a retainer part. A mistake in plain sight - it doesn't even look sturdy - from a company packed with engineers. One EVP head did roll."

"Medtronic antibacterial envelope reduces infections in patients receiving implanted cardiac devicesMar. 17, 2019 4:52 PM ET|About: Medtronic plc (MDT)|By: Douglas W. House, SA News Editor Results from a 6,983-subject global Phase 4 study, WRAP-IT, assessing the effectiveness of Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) TYRX Absorbable Antibacterial Envelope in reducing infections in patients receiving cardiac implantable electronic devices showed a treatment benefit. The data were presented at the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.Patients receiving a device with the TYRX mesh envelope experienced 40% less risk of major (systemic) infection and 61% less risk of pocket (local infection in the tissue surrounding the device) infection compared to standard-of-care preoperative antibiotics with no increase in procedure-related or system-related risk.Specifically, at month 12, 1.2% of patients receiving a standard device experienced a major infection compared to 0.7% for those receiving a TYRX-encased device (p=0.04). The company does not provide the pocket infection rates.The TYRX envelope, approved in the U.S. in 2013 and in Europe in 2014, is designed to stabilize the device after implantation while releasing the antimicrobial agents minocycline and rifampin over at least seven days.

"Buffett just dumped the 10% he had of 4 airlines at a big loss. Berkshire will be booking a $50 bil loss. He says airlines are changed forever. Since medical devices will continue to sell at normal levels as C-19 fades perhaps the medical device sector will see some Berkshire money. A moat, steady growth and dividends is what Buffett has been talking about for 75 years.This one could put Warren in his home office for good. He lost his tail in airlines years ago and swore off them only to rediscover them as a changed business and then bet big into a collapse of airline revenue and loading up of gov't debt that will turn them into quasi-government companies for years paying back the loans. Warren is like an old heavyweight boxer who should have quit undefeated."

"CFO on earnings call:""Turning to our balance sheet. Our financial position remained strong. In the quarter, we completed another euro debt offering #$%$6.25 billion and used the proceeds to reduce our U.S. dollar debt and prefund our March euro debt maturities, driving roughly $80 million of additional annualized savings. This was our third euro transaction in the past year and a half. Combined, we have issued over $18 billion and our portfolio now sits with a weighted average maturity of over 12 years and a weighted average coupon of less than 2%, among the lowest of the large cap issuers and the lowest among our competitors in medtech.As I shared with you at our Investor Day last month, we remain focused on investing, both organically and inorganically through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth strategies. Last month, we announced the acquisition of Ai Biomed to expand our ENT portfolio. In addition, we closed our acquisition of Avenu Medical and Peripheral Vascular earlier this month and we announced the completion of our Medicrea acquisition in spine last week.We expect both our organic and inorganic investments to fuel a longer term revenue growth acceleration, ultimately creating strong returns for our shareholders, supplemented by our strong and growing dividend. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our current yield of 2.1% places as in the upper quintile of S&P 500 Healthcare Companies.Now turning to our outlook, particularly with the rising cases of COVID around the world, the impact to our business remains difficult to predict. So we will continue to not provide our typical guidance. That said, I do want to give you a sense of the recovery ahead. While it is still early in our third quarter, we've seen our average weekly sales track ahead of the same weeks in the second quarter. So while there are pockets of more restrictions and delayed procedures around the globe, the impact to us has thus far been limited.As we've said before, hospitals are better equipped now to handle COVID patients and remain open to serve non-COVID patients. And over time and with education, patient fear is not as heightened as it was last spring and early summer. While there is still uncertainty ahead, if the recovery trend continues as it has to-date, our third quarter revenue could be flat to slightly up year-over-year on an organic basis. And we would continue to expect to return to normal organic revenue growth on a two-year stacked basis by our fiscal fourth quarter."""

"Dexcom reported very good earnings this am -- revenue up 43% yoy. They have great sensor tech and partners who incorporate their sensors with systems to compete with the 670G. The successor pump should have better sensors and MDT is creating an environment, as if taking a page from Apple's playbook. Although this environment will be open-ended. MDT just lost the head of Diabetes, hope the handoff goes smoothly and the 670G+ rolls out on time.https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/06/08/1866069/0/en/Medtronic-and-Tidepool-Work-Together-on-Interoperable-Automated-Insulin-Pump-System-for-Diabetes-Management.html"
"MDT BEATS ON ALL EARNING REPORTS,GREAT NEWS."
"As I think about the value of my investments considering a hike of corporate taxes, the 2015 inversion comes to mind. About 53% of MDT revenue comes from the US. The bulk of employee comp and R&D is in the US. I haven't seen a breakdown of MDT's taxable income in the 160 or so countries it sells to. The inversion is looking good in the rear view mirror as a new tax plan seems high on the new priority list in DC."
"If the US corporate tax rate goes up 7% then MDT will see a base 7% increase on Taxable Income from the 53% of MDT revenue from the US. Since MDT has been running a 15% - 15.5% blended overall tax rate, so it will see approximately a 3.5% increase, maybe 3.6% to its overall tax rate driving it up to the 18.5% - 19% range. However, US tax based competitors will see their overall blended rates go up by 7%. The US is the only significant nation that allows a deduction from US tax for foreign tax paid but if less than the base rate then more tax is owed to the US -- if France taxes your French Taxable Income at 18% you then owe 10% to the IRS. The US has the highest corporate tax rate so it makes sense to do this. So, MDT's overall cash flows will take a hit but half the hit of many competitors leaving it with an overall tax rate of about 19% if the US goes back to the 28% level. That 9% difference is for a mature firm with taxable income around the world. Omar pushed for the COV inversion to Ireland. Now the Treasury Sect says she will push for a global minimum tax. I don't think that will happen because Ireland and many other countries would love to see big firms set up in their countries. What I think will happen is that new law will be passed which will make it very difficult if not impossible to invert. That what Sect Lew tried to do to sink the MDT/COV inversion. I am very glad the inversion is now 6 yrs old, I'll wager that Medtronic will be mentioned as a reason to pass new rules governing proposed inversions so more big fish don't get away. The 2015 inversion will allow the 9% of Taxable Income saved annually to be used for dividends and buybacks."

"""Medtronic now offers the first and only CE Mark approved leadless pacemaker portfolio, expanding the number of potential candidates for this groundbreaking technology throughout the world. Per the medical fraternity, with the approval of the device, more pacemaker patients will be eligible for a new treatment option. Notably, the regulatory approval is based on data from the MARVEL 2 (Micra Atrial Tracking Using A Ventricular accELerometer) study, assessing the safety and effectiveness of accelerometer-based atrial sensing algorithms.The results showed that the primary efficacy objective was met. The results were presented at the American Heart Association 2019 Scientific Sessions and published in JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology.We note that the first device from the Micra product line that received CE Mark was— Micra Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS) — the first leadless pacemaker to treat heart rhythm disorders in 2015. The following year, the same device got FDA approval.Significance of the Latest Approval and Market ProspectsThe latest device is superior to traditional pacemaker devices as it involves a minimally invasive implant procedure of a cosmetically invisible device. Even though the chances of complications with traditional devices are rare, they do involve costly and invasive surgery. However, the use of Micra has shown a substantial drop in major complications, unlike its traditional counterparts.Another advantage of Micra AV over the original Micra TPS is that it has several additional internal atrial sensing algorithms, which can detect cardiac movement. This allows the device to adjust pacing in the ventricle to coordinate with the atrium, thus, providing AV synchronous pacing therapy to patients with an AV block.The CE Mark is significant since Micra AV is the only pacemaker offering advantages of leadless pacing in Europe. Going by a 2019 Businesswire data, according to a new study by iData Research, the $2.7 billion European Cardiac Surgery Market is expected to grow 67% by 2024. Given the market potential, the approval is well-timed."""

"MDT has been weak lately - I heard on CNBC that medtech ran up into the JP Morgan conference so there was no doubt some profit taking. Omar sounded good at the conference - he said that MDT was modeling 8% EPS growth which could have prompted profit taking by traders who rode it up from about $112. Further, given the statements from Omar and the CFO during the Q2 earnings rpt. I expect closer to 10% YOY Op EPS growth Q3 & Q4 -- and strength into FY '21 -- due to the pipeline.MDT looks good. The only area that comes to mind that underperformed is Diabetes which traces back to the delay of 670G sensors which gave up MDT's lead in closed loop systems - Diabetes segment revenue was down YOY close to 6% in the US last Q but up about 16% elsewhere. I assume that is why Diabetes has new leadership. I guess Omar gave them an EPS target to be transparent. He didn't say the 8% target was conservative but it should prove to be conservative. Revenue is growing and last Q the YOY ratio of SG&A/Rev was about 34% down from 34.8% Q2 last yr. So .8/34.8 = 2.3% improvement. That's a small % improvement but it is going the right way and that has been a long time coming. So the 80 bp improvement is supposed to improve to 120 bp improvement next Q, from memory, so that would be about a 3.5% improvement YOY. If MDT shows that Q3 it should propel EPS since revenue will be growing during a period of improving margins and that is what you want to see. Some of the COV combo is still snaking its way thru the system following the big refi of the COV debt last yr."

"It was encouraging to see MDT up a penny in a 143 DOW drop day. The consensus is that MDT is nosing up from being crowded out of hospitals by C-19. The CFO was uncommonly clear about this quarter at the Cowen Conference, released yesterday:Karen ParkhillJosh, the good news on that is that we did start to see our average daily sales turn last week, which we think is really encouraging. And we think underlying was turning the prior way, but it was muddled by the tough weather issues that we had across the United States. But we saw a clear turn last week. And so things have really started to improve as we predicted. We do remain optimistic on the quarter. We've got an overwhelming decrease of COVID cases throughout the world. ICU and hospital capacity is improving, and the vaccine roll-up is picking up momentum.So we've also seen stronger sales of our capital equipment, especially toward the end of last summer that we noted on our quarterly call. And we think that's a leading indicator and a positive sign because customers believe procedure volumes are coming back. So despite the COVID uncertainty, we have lots of reasons to be confident in our fourth quarter."
"Demand for their products will only increase for Medtronic, Stryker and Hill-Rom. Companies will have earnings releases in the months to come and I would assume these will surpass estimates. How much are we hearing the hospitals ""don't have enough beds, equipment, etc"". Might be a falling knife but I'm averaging in on these three in the weeks to come."
The only thing negative I see in the news is the potential pressure from US health reform. It looks like both parties will be focused on material revisions and of course cost controls. I see Stryker is down too - I figured it was pharma under the most pressure but it may be catching up to device makers.
"With fundamentals intact, MedTech to outperform in 2021 as vaccines drive recoveryDec. 26, 2020 11:12 PM ETMedtronic plc (MDT)By: Dulan Lokuwithana, SA News Editor1 CommentReversing the contraction this year, MedTech could outperform in 2021, J.P. Morgan Securities predict, citing the sector’s potential to combine the ‘strong vaccine-driven recovery trade’ with ‘positive underlying sector fundamentals.’ Despite a less bullish timeline for recovery, the analysts from SVB Leerink shared a similar view adding that the pandemic-driven in telehealth could benefit ‘all medtech subsectors.’According to JPM forecasts, in 2021, the industry top-line and bottom-line will expand at 10.1% and 24.8% YoY, compared to an estimated decline of 0.5% and 12.7% YoY in 2020, respectively.The analysts at JPM led by Robbie Marcus term the upcoming year as ‘a tale of two cities,’: a strong back half, benefited from the vaccine rollout, easy comps, and the deferred procedures, contrasting the first half likely impacted from the pandemic headwinds amid the ongoing surge in cases and another post-holiday COVID-19 wave.Despite the near-term uncertainty, they view the ‘underlying fundamentals of MedTech as healthy,’ with ‘meaningful innovation and undertreated end-markets’ supporting ‘a return to normalized growth in the mid-single digits’ in the future.The report from JPM name Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) as top large-cap picks and Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD) and AtriCure (NASDAQ:ATRC) as top small-cap picks.For Medtronic, the proven track record of execution, reinforced by the new management and improving fundamentals, should ‘shine-through’ in a post-pandemic scenario, the analysts point out, expecting the company, with a valuation gap to peers, to outperform the broader group with multiple expansion along the way.With pharmacy channel headwinds behind, Dexcom is ‘well-positioned ahead of a G7 launch’ as the company focuses on deeper penetration and new market opportunities to ensure long-term success, the report suggests.Having demonstrated resilience amid pandemic headwinds, both Insulet and AtriCure have a 'long runway for growth,’ the researchers write, citing their upcoming product launches."

"Medtronic MDT-NYSEBuy -- Price $100.05 on Aug. 7by Edward JonesMedtronic is one of the most diversified medical-technology companies in the world, specializing in cardiac and vascular devices, restorative therapies, diabetes devices, and minimally invasive therapies. Its innovative new products in robotic surgery, diabetes, and pacemakers, along with its strong brand reputation, should support solid long-term growth. Medtronic has a market-leading position in most areas that it operates in. While pricing pressure is a risk in the medical-device industry, we believe that Medtronic’s ability to continue to develop innovations will more than offset this risk."
"The DOJ inquiry into a $108 mil acquisition COV made over 5 years ago is an example of the gov't having unlimited dollars to waste. All of MDT's ventilator operations were in Galway Ireland - humming along on at about 500 high end ventilator units a month. believe I read that ventilator engineering was in MDT-Israel. Then came Covid-19 and MDT started to ramp up Galway and partner with various industrial concerns like GM & Ford to help produce its low end units for which it gave up the plans to those models. The ""probe"" will amount to nothing. Some DOJ attorney no doubt included this small purchase to be overly inclusive so that nothing possible would be missed. Nothing to see here..."
What do people think about Medtronic’s recent $40 million investment in Titan Medical and its robotics patents? Sure looks like the initial move towards an acquisition.

"Medtronic is continuing to refi debt, which will incur one time expenses in the current quarter to call the debt, and that will produce lower period interest expense in future periods. The last new MDT corporate borrowing used to call debt was in Euro in the amount of $7 bil at a blended rate of 0.875% or 87.5 basis points for senior unsecured debt. That is dirt cheap where I come from.. I assume the next one could be a tad higher but will probably be very low coupon as well. This is a no brainer if you're willing to incur the refi expenses which are cash expenses. I hope these crazy low Euro rates are not a sign of financial problems ahead for Europe like Italian bank failures. Cash and equivalents are worthless in Europe other than having a deposit balance - maybe that stimulates the economy by forcing people out of cash into risk investments."

Working remotely from home probably suites many bio-med engineers and the projects as well. Morgan Stanley may be right about their $140 target for 12/21."
After hours Friday volume 269.9k. Down 4.95. Not just a few shares. Could not find any news.
Nice day up $3 - Stryker is also up 3% so there is a bid in for med devices today. Hopefully the deferral of elective procedures will produce a steady recovery of delayed Q4 revenues. I think it will take another 90 days to be at full speed. If we and the world avoids a second wave this winter it should stay strong.
"Nice 5% run for the stock, albeit on low trading volumes so far. Up on an acquisition announcement is good to see. It's a question of time until MDT gets back on track at the $120 level of earlier this year. Won't be a straight line -- may be until Q3 (Nov, Dec, Jan) before full revenue is flowing, assuming C-19 is under control."
"From MedlineThe company will host a live audio webcast of the RAS Investor Update to provide access to all interested stakeholders.

Join Us for the Session Developing & Manufacturing a State-of-the-Art Robotic Radio-Surgical System: Supplier Partnership Strategies for a Successful Launch, to Be Held at MD&M Minneapolis Oct. 23 - 24, at the Minneapolis Convention Center.Last month during an earnings call, the medtech giant said investors and analysts would get their first look at the technology – and noted details would come at a later time. Up until the last few months, there had been some secrecy surrounding Medtronic’s surgical platform. The company had been quiet about the device that was originally expected to launch in 2018. However, delays pushed the timeline for the device back and gave Medtronic’s competitor Intuitive Surgical, a longer runway.In June, Medtronic shocked the surgical robotics space when it revealed a 4-year-partnership with Karl Storz. It was revealed in the collaboration that El Segunda, CA-based Karl Storz would incorporate its 3D visualization components into Medtronic’s surgical robotics platform.About a month after the collaboration announcement, Sunnyvale, CA-based Intuitive Surgical acquired the robotic endoscope portion of Schölly Fiberoptic’s business for an undisclosed sum. Schölly Fiberoptic is a player in the field of visualization systems for minimally invasive diagnostic and surgical applications, headquartered in Germany — and one of Intuitive’s strategic suppliers.Medtronic’s reveal next week will allow Intuitive to get a clearer picture of one of its top competitors. But questions remain about Verb Surgical another one of the surgical robotic pioneer’s competitors. Recall that Verb is a joint venture involving Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon and Verily Life Sciences, an Alphabet company. Verb has been pretty quiet about its technology offering a demo to senior leadership from Verily, J&J, and Alphabet in 2017."

Nice to see MDT recover some of the % loss from 4% to 2.5%. Karen Parkhill the CFO is answering questions for the Barclays conference today as I type - started at 9am EDT. As a sign of the times the conference was switched from a conference room to a group phone conference.
Great company! I’m hopeful this epidemic will soon pass and the country and get back to work! MDT is a solid investment.
MDT is about to dip with the market. I'm staying the course. I am glad my capital is in a Dividend Aristocrat. This too will pass.
"$SENS will gain market share from $DXCM, $MDT, $PODD, just a matter of time, go $SENS"
126 pull back?
Great read about a few stocks in the healthcare sector http://bit.ly/2DIInQl
"Im bullish, here’s why. MDT offers a complete suite of products and services for the entire medical ecosystem. COVID-19 cut off core revenue streams by forcing hospitals to focus on treating C-19, stopping elective procedures, stopping clinical research, a profit center. The improved treatment of C-19 allows hospitals to allow elective procedures and restart clinical research. The future is a slow and unsexy return to higer revenues and margins. MDT is sitting on $$$ reserves that is used for acquisition as we have seen, leading to stronger future growth."
