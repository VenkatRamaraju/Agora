"Is this the institutional buys ? I think yhis company is a great opportunity because they provide the cloud based platform for the insurance companies. They have market for this. It will go up. Today is a werd day for the ipo because of the Nasdaq being down but the volume is around 8 million. Is this because its Friday and the Nasdaq being down or does this mean there isn't much interest?. This isn't a bank, it isn't a insurance company its a tech platform right? Anybody have any insight on this? Thanks in advance."

When they price it at $27 bidding starts. Once a certain duration of time elapses. Shares go public and you're able to buy. If bidding was low prior to going public the stock price could easily be below $27. If bidding high then price could be high. If you put in a request for shares at $50 per and the stock opened at $30. you would get shares at $30 even though you requested $50. Hope this helps anyone out there. Feel free to add more to this or correct me if I am wrong.

"Unless you're day trading, my advice is not to jump on this thing at the open, or you might find yourself buying at the top on any inflated hype. If your plan is to invest for the long term, or even swing trade it, I would not buy in until at least next week. Of course, this is just my opinion. But, IPOs usually settle in price within a week or so. If I had to guess, profit-taking on this one will likely commence on Monday or Tuesday, and then begin to settle some by next Friday. Whatever you do, good luck with your trades!"

"who cares, it's exciting watching the price change so quickly!"
It doesn't help that they are opening on a day when the NASDAQ is down. Momentum is subdued. Maybe it will move up on Monday or Tuesday?

DCT has just released its Quarter results. They beat the estimate and expect to grow as it expects. I think the share price will come back to mid 40st within the next week.
