The average volume needs to come back to normal till the share price starts moving up. The trend on the number of shares trading each day these days has been down. I expect the bullish side is going to happen soon.
I think there is overreacting here
"First time in my life, I was a panic-seller. There is no interest for this stock. Market thinks, that the growth-story is over."
Short maybe trapped. It needs to close above Fridays Close to at least start the move up.
Novice investor here. Just purchased 50 shares @36.00. Can't understand why its down so much?
Mega dumping just happened. If it resists and goes above you can expect a short squeeze
Bollinger Bands pattern found!
Just take a look at the lows for the day of the last year. Today is the lowest day in a year. Is the company in a better position than it was last year? Of course it is just take a look at their financials! This is was a combination of panic sellers and shorts taking advantage of that. If you’re like me you’re going to be checking on this stock next week and regretting selling if you had some or not buying at this prices because of fear. This is oversold and will be back to 40s in no time and close to 50 by the end of the month!
"They are trying very hard to keep this down, Lets see how much they have today. Ideally I would like it to cross 32 and close higher than yesterday."
It was green for a minute ... five hours ago. Sellers are still in control.
If it gains momentum more will join
RSI 23. Over sold stock !
Look at all the early shorts on here trying to make it seem like it’s bad. It was an over reaction on nothing but slightly lower price prediction. This is easily 51 dollars! Buy and hold! It looks like hedges have finally let go!
This will suddenly be up 8% in a day soon watch
Wall Street analysts are predicting a 55.93% increase in the stock current price as of 10:30am this morning. Buy now!!
DCT technology is popular name in Insurance technology. Competitor of Guidewire. I am worked in this technology and know that it has huge upside potential. Bought $10k worth of stock at $35.
Only question do I wait to test 32-33 again before jumping in?......
Here it is start buying now under 35.
"I am still in, I had my finger on the sell button at 30.9 but Ill watch a bit more."
today is a watch and see day. It needs to have a positive close to at least start the move up
It has breached the support 31.25. SO it is a falling knife.
Do some research! Look at the companies financials easily worth 49-50 right now! Easiest buy in the market right now!
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while DCT barley does anything at all."
I just bought 3k worth I know an overreaction when I see one
what happened to this stock? missed earning or what?
Average price target is $51.50 - seem reasonable - solid company
just bought more today loading up while it's cheap this rocket is going to Pluto next week. Easiest buy ever
First time I've bought DCT. I hope it was a good decision but I'm beginning to wonder. Keeps going down but so does everything else I buy.
Thanks for the discounts! I just bought more!

RSI is well below 30 now. Oversold stock.
"This will recover! The lower the price, the bigger the reward! I am happy with these drops because I can buy a 49 dollar value stock at these prices!"
After today's 3 major dumpings the RSI has come down to 18. An extremely over sold stock.
Lack of exposure is the issue. Nobody is remotely familiar with this stock. Unless the words get around it will be a slow crawl.
I believe people will end up making great money if buying in low 30’s
pre market volume and price looks good today! gonna be a good week!
Potential of $47 is a 30% upside. Easiest buy ever!
day traders may not love this stock. Longs will benefit.
"Blast from the past - if this doesn't make you feel fleeced (or defeathered?) I dunno what will - 98.2% of the stock sold in the richly-priced IPO was from selling shareholders:""Duck Creek’s common stock is being priced at $46.00 per share, including 8,910,000 shares offered by the selling stockholders and 90,000 shares offered by Duck Creek."""
Just need a little buying power now
