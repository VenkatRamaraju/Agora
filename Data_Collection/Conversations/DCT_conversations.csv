This is oversold. There will be a rebound soon. Be patient. Don't expect that happen in the next few days though.
"Wow, over 20% ripped out."
just bought more today loading up while it's cheap this rocket is going to Pluto next week. Easiest buy ever
I’m in but this is boring
"As far as I can figure, the institutions, which own some 70% of the stock - and in cooperation with their market maker - are just looking for any bagholder at all to come out of the woodwork and take the stock... this is not a possibility, it appears to be exactly what is happening. These guys own boatloads of the stock, and they really don't care how low it goes. They are in full-on distribution mode."
yes!I bought this Gem..
Beat estimate!!!
I just bought 3k worth I know an overreaction when I see one
so us average joes don't get a chance at the IPO price.... fair enough i suppose however i am not longer investing after an opening 54% above IPO price.
Wow spike up at the closing
down due to guidance I guess
"Short Interest shares - source: NASDAQShort Interest Ratio 0.96 Days to CoverShort Interest % Float % - source: NASDAQ (short interest), Capital IQ (float)Dark Pool Short Volume 319,789 shares - source: FINRADark Pool Short Volume Ratio 33.42% - source: FINRA"
Bout to cut losses.
I believe people will end up making great money if buying in low 30’s
DCT Industrial Trust reached an all time high at 45.82
$4.5 Billion market cap (even after todays haircut) for what ?Keep telling yourselves that you 'beat' the quarterly report.
DCT Industrial Trust reached an all time high at 56.96
Look at all the early shorts on here trying to make it seem like it’s bad. It was an over reaction on nothing but slightly lower price prediction. This is easily 51 dollars! Buy and hold! It looks like hedges have finally let go!
I am staying far away from DCT - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com
"Expect a lot of volatility with this stock in the coming days. That being said, patience with in a reasonable amount of time will be rewarded."
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.56% to 50.40
time to move up
Lack of exposure is the issue. Nobody is remotely familiar with this stock. Unless the words get around it will be a slow crawl.
DCT Industrial Trust reached an all time high at 49.13
I think there is overreacting here
another losing day how long will you hold
"For comparison, BEKE IPO began trading yesterday around 12:20 EST. So, it could be at least another hour."
Here it is start buying now under 35.
Duck Creek reached an all time low at 31.71
The average volume needs to come back to normal till the share price starts moving up. The trend on the number of shares trading each day these days has been down. I expect the bullish side is going to happen soon.
they destroyedthis stock
Just need a little buying power now 
When can we buy? what time ?
If next earning will be good we might see ~$60 by the end of the year
"""Duck Creek Technologies (Nasdaq: DCT) is a leading provider of core system solutions to the P&C and General insurance industry."""

DCT Industrial Trust is up 5.92% to 47.57
We saw this same thing happen with Twitter last year everyone Twitter is done it dropped harshly now look at Twitter
only 13% of the stocks are owned by general public. Mostly institutions. Government owns 3600 shares.
SEC is blind to this manipulation. Many option chains are expiring today. Almost every single stock is manipulated. Retailer should make the most of the situation
will this be another flop like RKT or a winner?
Got to double test the 30.15 range. No rush!
If it gains momentum more will join
accumulate as much as you can under $40....it will at least going back up to $42.6 in a few days
They had some interesting insights about DCT on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
DCT Industrial Trust is down 5.50% to 49.94
wasn?t it supposed to open at like 27 a share now it?s bumped up to somewhere in the 60?s at open? #$%$ is going on that cannot be good.
its over let us sell and move on
today is a watch and see day. It needs to have a positive close to at least start the move up
Average price target is $51.50 - seem reasonable - solid company
Duck Creek reached an all time low at 32.25
All good so far. Let's get quietly to 52-53 before everyone piles on when they realize what the heck Insurtech is.
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.56% to 51.51
Is there a 90 lockup period as most IPOs have?
day traders may not love this stock. Longs will benefit.

"First time in my life, I was a panic-seller. There is no interest for this stock. Market thinks, that the growth-story is over."

Duck Creek reached an all time low at 30.62

It has breached the support 31.25. SO it is a falling knife.
Short Squeeze.

Mega dumpings today. 10:35 110k shares 1:40 85k shares2:30 58k sharesObviously a large company is doing it
Only question do I wait to test 32-33 again before jumping in?......
RSI is well below 30 now. Oversold stock.
With good news people are going to hurry to load . Seriously anyone who loaded up at low 32 will make a lot of money.
I don't think anyone wants you to sell this stock. All buy. Just that the target price is slightly less.
I don't like to say ist: NO GROWTH --- story is over.
I see Raul has left the building
Right seat hostages
"Hi, how far below the 52 week low will Duck Dynasty drop today?Geez, I would NOT want to be anywhere near this falling knife. Best to stick with growing companies."
"Unless you're day trading, my advice is not to jump on this thing at the open, or you might find yourself buying at the top on any inflated hype. If your plan is to invest for the long term, or even swing trade it, I would not buy in until at least next week. Of course, this is just my opinion. But, IPOs usually settle in price within a week or so. If I had to guess, profit-taking on this one will likely commence on Monday or Tuesday, and then begin to settle some by next Friday. Whatever you do, good luck with your trades!"
what happened to this stock? missed earning or what?
They will try to keep selling just enough to keep it below 35.
"Might have to agree with Joseph, put a tourniquet on this"
"As of now, it is still due to open @ 65-66."
Going under 35 this week
This should be interesting...
"I dunno, but if it walks like a duck and squawks like a duck?"

someone is buying millions of dollars worth of shares in one pop it seems - yesterday and today
It was green for a minute ... five hours ago. Sellers are still in control.
DCT has just released its Quarter results. They beat the estimate and expect to grow as it expects. I think the share price will come back to mid 40st within the next week.
who is our competition?
Crazy Bad today 12/27. No buyers anywhere. Ready to throw in the towel.
Whoever loaded this up at low 34s are going to make a lot of money.
This seems like an overreaction. I have not held the stock that long. Is this a company that underpromises and overdelivers. Thinking about adding. Appreciate any commentary on their history of guidance.
beat estimate
woo hoo up 17 cents after 25% loss
In at 33.50...let's see how Monday plays out. I may regret the wait...
uh oh up whopping 9 cents
Potential of $47 is a 30% upside. Easiest buy ever!
What’s the 411 on this? I’m in 40k keep hearing about shorties etc but looks flatlined or trending down at worst.
I did'nt expect the stock to stay at this price.....
Mega dumping just happened. If it resists and goes above you can expect a short squeeze
get ready to see green today!
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.79% to 45.12
DCT technology is popular name in Insurance technology. Competitor of Guidewire. I am worked in this technology and know that it has huge upside potential. Bought $10k worth of stock at $35.

"Is this the institutional buys ? I think yhis company is a great opportunity because they provide the cloud based platform for the insurance companies. They have market for this. It will go up. Today is a werd day for the ipo because of the Nasdaq being down but the volume is around 8 million. Is this because its Friday and the Nasdaq being down or does this mean there isn't much interest?. This isn't a bank, it isn't a insurance company its a tech platform right? Anybody have any insight on this? Thanks in advance."
i am selling and buying inmd
Someone dumped real big. They don't have to meet the Price target of 50. Even 40 would do.
beat earnings
They need some good news to push this up. Very volatile. A bump and then a downtrend. This cycle has been going on for the last 5 or 6 days.

is it halted???
Extremely low volume. You need a much bigger volume for a short squeeze. 81k is nothing.
Starting to feel like the guy without a gas mask on wondering why.
Sorry guys. The growth-thesis is over for at least one year. Why do think this stock will bounce? Thousands of better companies ...Long term play. Ok.
"I am still in, I had my finger on the sell button at 30.9 but Ill watch a bit more."

Too volatile. Someone is playing with this.
My patience is wearing out for DCT.

"Beat me, they have 370 M in the bank, low debt and making profit. I will buy same at the bottom today."
newbie bought in at 35.70. I have no doubt this is easily hitting 40$ next week. Easy buy and hold for gold.
Do some research! Look at the companies financials easily worth 49-50 right now! Easiest buy in the market right now!
First time I've bought DCT. I hope it was a good decision but I'm beginning to wonder. Keeps going down but so does everything else I buy.
down 30% in 2days and more falling
I missed when it hit 33.91. Dang. Hope it doesn't go that low again. I thought 34.94 average was risk worth taking. Apparently it has gone down further :) Hope this average is still good enough.
I repeat: NO GROWTH. Waiting two years for a better future?
Option chains are expiring today lol Load up guys. This is going to make you rich.
Will drop to $34 end of day
The company has 131.59 M outstanding shares of which 3.72 M shares are currently shorted by investors with about 8.37 days to cover.
It doesn't help that they are opening on a day when the NASDAQ is down. Momentum is subdued. Maybe it will move up on Monday or Tuesday?
Are you guys able to trade this stock? I bought 2 hours ago and still it doesn’t appear in my account. The buy order already been filled.
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.71% to 50.57
Tipranks has issued a strong buy signal anyway. 7 analysts buy 2 hold. Basically this is a bargain price.
"This one is on a long, slow bleed trajectory.I dunno, maybe put in a buy order at $18? But things will change either for better or for worse, so you would need to adjust your thesis.The stock is valued at $4.5B with $300M in annual sales, and net losses, whilst guiding down...These aren't the metrics of dreams, that's for sure.I guess you can hope that someone will buy them out to integrate into their business? This doesn't look much like a long-lasting stand-alone company... but wishing someone will buy them out could take a lifetime..."
Bollinger Bands pattern found!
its over until 2022 for dct
Be prepare !! big day is coming !!

pre market volume and price looks good today! gonna be a good week!
Wildly fluctuating today.
DCT is better
Thanks for the discounts! I just bought more!
Novice investor here. Just purchased 50 shares @36.00. Can't understand why its down so much?
-32% and no bottom in sight
"This will recover! The lower the price, the bigger the reward! I am happy with these drops because I can buy a 49 dollar value stock at these prices!"
Just take a look at the lows for the day of the last year. Today is the lowest day in a year. Is the company in a better position than it was last year? Of course it is just take a look at their financials! This is was a combination of panic sellers and shorts taking advantage of that. If you’re like me you’re going to be checking on this stock next week and regretting selling if you had some or not buying at this prices because of fear. This is oversold and will be back to 40s in no time and close to 50 by the end of the month!
This will suddenly be up 8% in a day soon watch
At 10:35 someone made the largest dump since that massive dump on October 15th.
Why is this company valued at $4.1b?
"I’m out. This will hit 20s, any news short term will be negative."
"They are trying very hard to keep this down, Lets see how much they have today. Ideally I would like it to cross 32 and close higher than yesterday."
After today's 3 major dumpings the RSI has come down to 18. An extremely over sold stock.
Wall Street analysts are predicting a 55.93% increase in the stock current price as of 10:30am this morning. Buy now!!
Short maybe trapped. It needs to close above Fridays Close to at least start the move up.
#$%$
When they price it at $27 bidding starts. Once a certain duration of time elapses. Shares go public and you're able to buy. If bidding was low prior to going public the stock price could easily be below $27. If bidding high then price could be high. If you put in a request for shares at $50 per and the stock opened at $30. you would get shares at $30 even though you requested $50. Hope this helps anyone out there. Feel free to add more to this or correct me if I am wrong.
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.75% to 58.02
excited about this new SaaS company DCT. Long and strong 250 shares $40 each :-) Good Luck Longs!!!
Sellers have overtaken buyers here too.
"Worth $4.6bb, tiny revenue!Not for me!"
"FYI... IPOs usually begin trading around 11:00 EST. But, it could a little later."
