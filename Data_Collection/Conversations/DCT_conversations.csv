"If you‚Äôre a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It‚Äôs a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
I don‚Äôt know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Are you guys able to trade this stock? I bought 2 hours ago and still it doesn‚Äôt appear in my account. The buy order already been filled.
is it halted???
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.56% to 50.40
Duck Creek is down 24.83% to 34.75
DCT Industrial Trust is up 6.75% to 58.02
Will drop to $34 end of day
Just take a look at the lows for the day of the last year. Today is the lowest day in a year. Is the company in a better position than it was last year? Of course it is just take a look at their financials! This is was a combination of panic sellers and shorts taking advantage of that. If you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôre going to be checking on this stock next week and regretting selling if you had some or not buying at this prices because of fear. This is oversold and will be back to 40s in no time and close to 50 by the end of the month!
End me. People please look at this stock I‚Äôm begging you. Earnings beat and then down even more.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don‚Äôt start trading without reading their daily email each morning!

It doesn't help that they are opening on a day when the NASDAQ is down. Momentum is subdued. Maybe it will move up on Monday or Tuesday?
DCT has just released its Quarter results. They beat the estimate and expect to grow as it expects. I think the share price will come back to mid 40st within the next week.
earning is out
It‚Äôs going down to $27
Potential of $47 is a 30% upside. Easiest buy ever!
#$%$

wasn?t it supposed to open at like 27 a share now it?s bumped up to somewhere in the 60?s at open? #$%$ is going on that cannot be good.

"Is this the institutional buys ? I think yhis company is a great opportunity because they provide the cloud based platform for the insurance companies. They have market for this. It will go up. Today is a werd day for the ipo because of the Nasdaq being down but the volume is around 8 million. Is this because its Friday and the Nasdaq being down or does this mean there isn't much interest?. This isn't a bank, it isn't a insurance company its a tech platform right? Anybody have any insight on this? Thanks in advance."
This should be interesting...
so us average joes don't get a chance at the IPO price.... fair enough i suppose however i am not longer investing after an opening 54% above IPO price.

newbie bought in at 35.70. I have no doubt this is easily hitting 40$ next week. Easy buy and hold for gold.
DCT is better
Sell this stock before it hits $30 by next week. The private equity firm Atlas will dump on you.

"FYI... IPOs usually begin trading around 11:00 EST. But, it could a little later."
SEC is blind to this manipulation. Many option chains are expiring today. Almost every single stock is manipulated. Retailer should make the most of the situation
"After review, auto insurance on the cell ain‚Äôt no big deal. Pfffft"
Tipranks has issued a strong buy signal anyway. 7 analysts buy 2 hold. Basically this is a bargain price.

Whoever loaded this up at low 34s are going to make a lot of money.
"who cares, it's exciting watching the price change so quickly!"
I hope it be like LMND
"Priced @ 27.00. But, it could open in the 30's or 40's."
Executives will make their money in the next few months and then will go bankrupt.
It's now open for trading/investing! Tread carefully! GLTA!
will this be another flop like RKT or a winner?
All good so far. Let's get quietly to 52-53 before everyone piles on when they realize what the heck Insurtech is.

"Wired as F, beat earnings still nothing happend, when will it go up at 2025 #$%$!"
"Wow, over 20% ripped out."
Know your stock. Learn more about DCT...
looks like we are screwed
When they price it at $27 bidding starts. Once a certain duration of time elapses. Shares go public and you're able to buy. If bidding was low prior to going public the stock price could easily be below $27. If bidding high then price could be high. If you put in a request for shares at $50 per and the stock opened at $30. you would get shares at $30 even though you requested $50. Hope this helps anyone out there. Feel free to add more to this or correct me if I am wrong.

"It looks like 35 is ""max pain"" for options holders. At max pain options ( calls and puts ) expire worthless."
They better KILL IT on earnings or down to $29

what happened to this stock? missed earning or what?
"I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Bernard Mikhail‚Äôs program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having $80k to $720k in just 9 weeks. you can contact him via üÜÉüÖ¥üÖªüÖ¥üÖ∂üÜÅüÖº @Mikhailsignals"
"Unless you're day trading, my advice is not to jump on this thing at the open, or you might find yourself buying at the top on any inflated hype. If your plan is to invest for the long term, or even swing trade it, I would not buy in until at least next week. Of course, this is just my opinion. But, IPOs usually settle in price within a week or so. If I had to guess, profit-taking on this one will likely commence on Monday or Tuesday, and then begin to settle some by next Friday. Whatever you do, good luck with your trades!"

Novice investor here. Just purchased 50 shares @36.00. Can't understand why its down so much?
We saw this same thing happen with Twitter last year everyone Twitter is done it dropped harshly now look at Twitter
This seems like an overreaction. I have not held the stock that long. Is this a company that underpromises and overdelivers. Thinking about adding. Appreciate any commentary on their history of guidance.
