"NAV discountThe lag effect means bulker owners including Genco Shipping & Trading, Star Bulk Carriers, Navios Maritime Partners and Eagle Bulk Shipping are trading at big discounts to NAV, according to Giveans.""These reduced equity prices could/should be a good thing if companies take advantage by repurchasing shares,"" he said.In Oslo, DNB Bank estimates Golden Ocean's NAV at NOK 99 ($11.74) per share, but the stock closed NOK 16.75 below this level on Friday last week and was trading at around $9.75 on the Nasdaq bourse.Last week, DNB raised its target price for Golden Ocean to NOK 133 after revising its one-year forward forecast for asset prices, in light of better-than-expected freight rates.For investors, Giveans thinks there is still plenty of value to be squeezed out of bulker stocks.""Obviously, the best opportunities were a year ago before the stocks tripled to current prices,"" he told TradeWinds.""That said, [there is] still a lot of upside, as there remains a large disconnect between elevated rates and strong asset values versus undervalued equities.""Looking ahead, Giveans thinks ""cooler heads will prevail as rates stabilise in the coming weeks"" but believes earnings season will help with optimism.""I think this upcoming round of [third-quarter] earnings calls will be robust, with blow-out quarters, strong guidance and big dividends."
"technicals look good if we stay over $27. 50. Within 2 weeks all the shipping companies will be releasing earnings and they will be phenomenal. The outlook for the next year will be even better, NMM is forecast to have over $16 eps for 2022. With a NAV close to $100 per share, I see no downside and we may hopefully go to the moon."
"Ready for a squeeze? Capesize FFAs poised for volatility due to urgent hedgingThe capesize derivatives market finds itself in a situation that would have seemed unthinkable a month agoFreight derivatives for capesize bulk carriers have seen an almighty sell-off over the past week, but now options holders are quickly finding themselves exposed to losses.It is a situation that would have been unthinkable just over a month ago.The kryptonite in the capesize forward freight agreement (FFA) market is the relatively large volumes of call options that have been struck in the last couple of weeks at prices between $27,000 and $35,000 per day for November and December contracts.These were likely bought early in the year, when there was a more bullish outlook to the market — all of which changed around a month ago, when concerns surrounding China's economy and commodity demand intensified.If the market moves below these levels, this exposes the sellers of those calls to the downside.And during the day's trading on Tuesday, it seemed as though the moment had come. Bidding for November contracts was at $29,800 per day and for December contracts was around $26,500 per day.One trader likened the potential downside squeeze to the GameStop short squeeze ""but in reverse"", referring to the extraordinary 1,500% increase in the retailer's share price during two weeks in January.Now FFA traders are worried that hedging this exposure could create even more wild moves in the paper market.""The potential for extreme volatility in cape FFAs is there, as the volume of open option strikes sitting 15-30% below the current market could create hedging trade flow above and beyond the liquidity available in the futures market,"" one trader told TradeWinds.""A lot of fresh puts were traded over the past six weeks.""In the physical market on Tuesday, Baltic Exchange panellists assessed the 5TC average capesize spot rate $3,965 lower at $43,985 per day.ThresholdPhilippe van den Abeele, chief investment officer of Consortium Maritime Trading Ltd, sees a critical threshold approaching.Looking at the derivatives market from a technical point of view, the capesize spot market has maintained a resistance line of around $38,000 per day over the past 10 or 12 years, he explained.In other words: ""Every time we've reached that [level] over the past 10 years, capes tended to turn south with prices dropping quite consistently for the next three to four weeks.""An exception came in July, when the capesize 5TC assessment broke through the $38,000 level and kept on going until it reached the multi-year high of $86,870 per day on 6 October, van den Abeele noted.""I'm not saying I think it will happen, but I'm watching it like a hawk because I am convinced that if it breaks $38,000 [per day] convincingly on the downside then you will see a fresh bunch of sellers coming in to the FFA market,"" he added.""The possibility of bouncing higher from that level is equally feasible as we have reached a pivotal level in the recent cape freight pricing rollercoaster, as dry bulk prices tend to be mean-reverting over time.""AccelerationThere is a psychological element to this potential watershed too, van den Abeele said.""Just imagine, until three or four weeks ago the majority of the people out there held long cape positions for December delivery or at least til the end of November, believing that the Chinese congestion combined with exuberant Chinese steel production was going to last until then,"" he said.""When that crowd realises 'Oh, it's not going to happen', it's like you're going through a funnel — they all want to get to the exit but the door is very small for everyone to go through it.""Once the market decides to sell, everything tends to accelerate, he explained.""Shipowners start to panic in the physical market, the FFA market also panics, therefore the shipowners see the FFAs go down and it goes faster and faster,"" he went on.""That's why we have this massive drop — because the equilibrium at which you reach $86,000 per day is fragile, very fragile,"" he said, referring to the spot market's zenith.This acceleration effect was visible in the FFA market last week, according to Kerry Deal, head of business development at Freight Investor Services.""The fall in capes [last] week was admittedly steeper than some expected, with a storm of bad news driving sentiment lower on the paper, which included further issues at Evergrande, concerns on further Chinese steel production curbs, and Vale trimming down [fourth-quarter] production guidance against falling iron ore prices,"" Deal told TradeWinds"

"Correction on that last Put update:It seems there were two 1,753 contract transactions today - I missed one and then mixed them up when looking for the details because they were the identical amount of contracts at the same $20 strike, but at different dates.So it looks like this:1,753 Put contracts at the $20 strike for the 17 Jun ‘22 expiration and…1,753 Put contracts at the $20 strike for the 20 Jan ‘23 expirationThe Jun’s went for around $2.00 and the Jan’s for around $3.50So a total of 3,560 contracts for around $2.75 average price, representing 350,600 shares and a value of around $964,150.A fairly active day…Those Puts that went at the $20 strike for the Jan ‘23 expiration were around $3.50, not $2.00.But now went at the same $20 strike but now for the Jun ‘23 expiration another 1,753 contracts.So that’s a total of"

"Why is everyone so hung up on the dividend? Yes, it's an LP, and profits are supposed to be distributed to partners, but is a 50 cent ($2 per year) dividend REALLY going to make that much difference in the share price, especially if it is not sustainable? The real driver of the SP is value. AF has created value and the SP will reflect that soon."

"In the past, distributions have been announced late in the month following the ending of the quarter, about the 28th or the 29th day I believe the next Thursday and Friday are the 28th and 29th of October and we may see an announcement. Even if the distribution goes up by five cents, that would be a 100% increase in the quarterly distributions. That would make quite a headline. I’m hoping for $.50, Which would make it 1000% increase in the distribution."

"Sept. 28th the Capesize daily rate was under $70,000 per day and NMM was trading @ $32.80. Today still over $70,000 per day rate and it’s at ￼￼$28 because of the drop? That’s a drop of over $100m Market Cap. FYI, The Capesize daily rate was trading at less than $40,000 per day with NMM having a higher market cap than this. What’s else is off, the containerships are just starting to get into their higher rates with an additional 7 more ships rates to be reset over the next few months. Both of these 2 cylinders are firing at levels not seen in a long time and one of them (containerships) is set to fire at this level for at least 2 -3 years. When NNA comes on board, they are atleast currently making a profit at these depressed rate. If those rates go up, this would be a massive increase in revenue and profit. FYI, the dividends￼ will come, I’ve made a ton on AF’s dividends in the past, She’s being very cautious this time around. She made promises before about dividends and when the rates dropped and they were on spot rates, she had to do a 180. That’s when investors started to not trust her. Not trying to take her side here. She had to do what she had to do to survive. That’s why she’s being very cautious this time. She wants to lock in those rates first. That’s what she said her goal was with the dry bulk vessels on her last conference call. This is one of the best opportunities I’ve seen in a long time and I know she will pay a decent dividend when the time is right. That’s not a guess, that’s based on my passed history with NMM."
"It is difficult to forecast where spot rates will go amid such volatility, but they could lose another $20,000 per day by next month, if not December, Kartsonas said.""When all is done and settled, I do believe November and December averages will have a 3 in front,"" he said.""I do believe the smaller size vessels will act as resistance once the spot approaches such a level.""Australia's Rio Tinto plans to hire a to-be-named 170,000-dwt capesize to ship iron ore from Australia to China at $14.10 per tonne during the first half of November.The freight rate for a capesize on the benchmark Australia-China route lost $1.24 per tonne on Friday to come in at $14.264 per tonne.The capesize sector had a ""pretty bleak week"" amid falling demand in China and less production in rain-soaked Brazil, but the paper market has been signalling a decline, said Nick Ristic, lead dry cargo analyst.""FFAs (forward freight agreement rates) are certainly pricing a fall below $50,000 per day very soon, but the curve has been heavily backwardated for quite some time, so I don’t think you can say it was unexpected,"" he told TradeWinds.""The fundamentals would suggest that we’ll see things continue to slide into the first quarter of 2022, but as always with capes, we can’t rule out a fourth-quarter spike.""Stamatis Tsantanis, chief executive of pureplay capesize owner Seanergy Maritime Holdings, chalked up the falling spot rates to the volatile nature of this particular dry bulk sector.""The market went up too high too fast and now it is correcting to these levels,"" he told TradeWinds.""We do not see any material changes in demand-supply fundamentals. On the contrary, we believe there is going to be another spike before the year-end.""We also remain very bullish for the future fundamentals"
"Major Greek owner Angeliki Frangou has rejected criticism about her newly consolidated Navios being a hotch-potch of assets and defended its diversified nature as the way to go forward.Stifel analyst Ben Nolan used the word ‘conglomerate’ to describe bulker and containership Navios Maritime Partners, which became the largest US-listed company by vessel count earlier this month after gobbling up affiliated tanker player Navios Maritime Acquisition.Interviewed in Athens by Clarksons Platou analyst Omar Nokta, however, Frangou said that label was off the mark."" 'Conglomerate' is a collection of unrelated businesses,"" Frangou told a MarineMoney conference on Wednesday — the first to take place in physical attendance since February last year.""Basically the same skill set applies to all businesses,"" from containers to bulkers and tankers, Frangou added.""I will not call it a conglomerate, I'll call it a blue-water maritime transportation company with the advantage of getting even returns while you have uneven performance in the different segments,"" Frangou said.Navios Maritime Partners should rather be considered a ""diversified and sustainable proxy for world trade"" that works well as ""a good hedge on inflation as well,"" she said.Dispensing with the traditional pure-play model, which she described as ""challenged"", allows her to focus on earnings optimisation and more flexibility in chartering and acquisitions, she stressed.Earnings from booming bulkers and containerships represented a ""strong currency"" to buy up the Navios Acquisition tanker fleet, which is currently at the low part of the cycle.In a sentiment shared by other conference participants, Frangou said she also expected tanker markets to pick up as global travel recovers from the pandemic, even though it was difficult to say when exactly.""To judge from the number of people who have traveled to come to this conference… I think the tanker sector will do well.""Shareholders seem to share Frangou's optimism. Navios Partners shares appreciated considerably since the Navios merger deal, at a faster clip than pure-play bulker or boxship peers."
"Five pennies ? That's it ? All this talk of a super cycle and all of the eatnings that will be generated and we get a nickle? Imagine what our share would be if we encountered reduced rates. Do you think, perhaps, AF will purchase for us her personally owned leasing compamy? I don't think so, that's a guaranteed money maker. We only get to purchase the basket cases. To those that will say NMCI wasn't a basket case, I say, it shouldn't have been created in the first place. NMM should have purchased those containers for our own portfolio instead of setting up a new entity with money borrowed from NMM. At that time AF was into empire building using seperate asset classes. Currently she's into diversification. She had her cheerleaders back then and she has a new set today. No matter what actions she pursues, her accolades cheer her on. It took me three and a half years to sell but better late than never. My new ride. SBLK, will be reporting"
"Sim reported they purchased 7 ships in October for $320 million. Their ages were 2007-2009. The per TEU price paid was $13,646. Realizing NMM’s has a younger average age and the fleet likely has a higher TEU valuation, the Zim price paid would value NMM’s fleet at $3 billion. 55 dry bulk and 43 tankers added in and the valuation of this company several times higher than the current pps."
"Navios Maritime Acquisition chairwoman and CEO Angeliki Frangou said: “About one-third of our fleet will be in each of the dry bulk, containership and tanker segment.“We believe that this combination should result in a stronger, more resilient entity, mitigating sector-specific cyclicality, and enabling us to capitalise on opportunities throughout the industry and provide even returns to our stakeholders across cycles.”i guess she is confident she can maintain the .05 per quarter haha"

"If I were to define what NMM is, I would call it a growing partnership. We have grown In price per unit, expanded from dry bulk to containers and tankers and now it’s time to grow with the dividend. When A F expanded the segments of the company to protect the company from volatility it showed that growing the two more segments would alleviate volatility. The dividend/distribution is another way to stabilize the volatility And appreciate the unit price. We will soon find out her true ambitions and be able to determine if her goal is grandiose, or comprehensive."
"The market for capesize bulkers should continue declining amid lower iron-ore and steel production for the rest of 2021, according to brokers.The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average weighted across five key routes, slid 4.9% on Thursday to $57,374 per day, making for a rapid decline of 34% over the past two weeks.The paper market pointed to even lower rates well into next year's first quarter, according to Baltic Exchange data.The forward freight agreement (FFA) rate fell steadily over the next five months to $23,057 per day for February after losing $622 per day.Lower iron-ore guidance for 2021 from behemoths Vale and Rio Tinto and China's plans to curb steel production are weighing on market sentiment, said Rebecca Galanopoulos Jones, head of research at London broking house Alibra Shipping.""The latest figures from the World Steel Association forecast that for 2021 as a whole, steel production will contract by 1% from last year, with growth in 2022 expected to be flat,"" she told TradeWinds.Lower iron-ore guidance may cause capesize bulker rates to keep falling, brokers say.

"For the tanker portion:The recent leg higher for crude has come in sympathy with a surge by natural gas.

"Week ending 10/29/2021:Dry BulkCapesizeThe market has fallen sharply the last week as the amount of available tonnage in the East has increased and charterers holding back taking advantage of the negative sentiment. The West Australia rout with iron ore to China is down by 28%, now giving owners a time charter hire of 31,850 per day. The iron ore rout from Brazil to China is down by 26%. The overall basket is down by 34% indicating that the more illiquid routs has come off harder than where there is a more constant flow of cargo. This might indicate that there have been a lot of panic in the Capesize segment, and time of writing there is some signs of support, though still very nervous.PanamaxThis week the Panamax market has not shown any clear direction, but the underlying sentiment is negative.

"Fleet newsA look at the supply side of the container shipping market confirms carriers’ desperation to get hold of tonnage. Looking at the shipbuilding yards, 386 ships with a total capacity of 3.4 million TEU have been ordered so far this year. This has filled the yards for 2023 and 2024, when 1.6m TEU and 1.5m TEU respectively are scheduled for delivery. A further 375,000 TEU is already scheduled for delivery in 2025 as delivery earlier than this becomes harder to secure.The most popular container ships on order are those with a capacity of 13,000 to 16,999 TEU. 146 ships of this size with a total capacity of 2.1m TEU have been ordered so far this year. In the 20,000+ TEU ULCS range, 22 ships with a total capacity of 0.5m TEU have been ordered.Fleet growth is expected to slow down in 2022, before the many ships ordered at the end of 2020 and in 2021 are delivered, prompting a return to higher fleet growth in 2023 to 2025.OutlookYears of low freight rates resulting in rigorous cost cutting by carriers have left them in a great position to maximize profits now that the market has turned. Looking to the future, they have proven adept at using their upper hand at the negotiating table to lock shippers into longer-term contracts at today’s higher freight rates.Similarly, tonnage providers had the upper hand with charterers. By early September, chartering a 3,500 TEU ship would cost USD 77,000 per day, while chartering an 8,500 TEU ship cost USD 115,000 per day (source: Harper Petersen). In addition to attractive higher charter rates, tonnage providers are managing to secure longer-term contracts. In recent weeks, however, the steep rise in charter rates has stopped, but this is more a reflection of the lack of tonnage available for charter rather than falling demand.BIMCO expects the container market will remain strong well into 2022. Even as consumer demand for containerized goods begins to ease, there will be plenty of work to be done in clearing the backlog that has built up over the past many months, and lots of stocks that need to be restocked. The true test for the container shipping market will likely come in 2023, when the huge volumes of newbuilt shipping capacity ordered over the past year starts being delivered. Once this happens, the strength of the contracts currently signed may be tested as shippers and carriers, attracted by lower freight and charter rates, will try and get out of their obligations, as is always the case when a market recalibrates to a very different level.Before this happens, however, the world will continue to watch the container shipping industry and its ability to deliver on its promise of delivering global trade, even though the bottlenecks preventing a return to normal are mostly outside of carriers’ controls in ports and warehouses. As proven by the increasing list of ships waiting to berth at the ports of Los Angeles, carriers adding more capacity doesn’t solve the problems on land.The situation may get worse before it gets better. As long as China continues to pursue a zero-tolerance COVID-19 elimination strategy, the risk of more ports being closed or disruptions to hinterland connections remains high, adding to the time it that will take for the container shipping market to normalize.At the top of everyone’s list will be ensuring schedule reliability and a return to the status quo in which the sea-transport of goods returns to smooth sailing, and not the current headache-provoking situation, albeit potentially at higher freight rates than shippers had enjoyed in the past decade.Maritime Logistics"

"Spent hours listening to the CEO's on the New York Maritime Forum. All the CEO's in containers say the good times are going to last for quite some time. The CEO's in dry bulk said basically the same thing. The CEO's in tankers say the market is starting to turn now and will get hot quickly, not months, weeks. Everybody agrees they don't want new builds and the order book is low and will stay that way . Many CEO's said we need rates to stabilize and even pull back somewhat to prevent inflation which is what could kill the consumer and demand. Every CEO in every sector said their customers are wanting long term contracts, 3-5 years which is great for stability. Some said they have been holding back on the dividend in order to firm up their balance sheets and that unit holders and shareholders have been patient and now it's time to start taking care of them. Let's hope our CEO feels that way. So if you are short you are going to have a long road ahead of you. I hope to listen to NMM interview tomorrow when playback is available. Unless they are all wrong we are in for a pretty good period ahead."
"I actually hope AF keeps the dividend at 5 cents. Ali would much rather they buy back stock for 30 cents on the dollar. That would dramatically improve the stock price. However, shipping companies have been burned badly in the past, so now they are being much more prudent and conservative by paying down debt first. Imagine the dividend they can pay in 12-18 months when close to debt free. AF emphatically stated this is a growth stock, not income stock. If you want income now, there are plenty of alternatives. If you want a boatload of income in 2 years, load up on NMM while you can accumulate shares so cheap."
