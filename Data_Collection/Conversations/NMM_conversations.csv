"Who is this nutcase David and why is he spamming this forum? Who is KEM60 he continues to bash? I've never seen a post from that use. I've been an NMM owner for over six years and have followed this board. I can say, with 99% accuracy the only fake poster is David. If you read his history, he posts identical comments on other threads. There is something seriously wrong with that guy! (Anyone who uses the term ""son"" is obviously an uneducated, #$%$ #$%$ and that is the least of the reasons to ignore him.)@David - please go spam other boards."
"Many here will be shocked by my thoughts on the merger. I have been waiting for this for a long time,and the puzzle will be completed when NM/NSAL gets cannibalized as well (this will be a while yet,but it is inevitable).I know many feel pure plays are better,and they are if you like to trade and are nimble. For me though,stable is better and I think AF 's grand experiment of diversity via several companies is coming to an end..thankfully. I think she has realized it was a bad idea,and this is the absolute perfect time(ie,huge cash flow for NMM for at least 2-3 years) to solve many problems. So what will the ""new "" NMM be? A well diversified conglomerate that will be able to use all shipping sectors to weather the inevitable lows and highs of the industry. She really only needs to add RoRo's to complete the equation. I am going to stick around a while longer. I think in 12 to 18 months we will see a SFL type company..slow and steady.The pitfalls? She takes on too much debt and grows too much. That part worries me as she has almost destroyed NNA and NM with that strategy. If we were not seeing the rates we have(and can see into the future) NM would now be history. I want to see how this plays out now. If she is comfortable with slow and steady,so am I. If she wants to conquer the world and show all the boys how it's done,I'm gone...trader"
"Boxship charter rates hit unprecedented $200,000 a day, from SplashHere’s a couple paragraphs from the article Among the most eye catching deals reported has been concluded by fast growing Chinese carrier CU Lines, which has just shelled out a “whopping” $155,000 per day to take the 2,751 teu Northern Vivacity for a six-month charter, according to Alphaliner. CU Lines has grown from its domestic trading routes to take in new services to the US and Europe this year.S&P broking sources this week suggest a six-year-old 6,865 teu ship has been put up for sale with a price tag of $125m and a February 2022 delivery."
"Tomorrow’s presentation is up on NMM’s website. NMM will be larger in number of ships vs ATCO, STNG and SBLK. Those all have market caps between $918M to $3.2B. The lowest market cap, tankers. There’s a lot of room in unit price for this very diverse company to grow. Low debt, low share count, debt maturity spread out well over each year. Very impressive how this all came together."
"I don't post comments often, only when I feel a situation is poorly understood. For credibility, I was a (II ranked) Wall Street analyst for 13 years and then worked on the buy-side for 22 years, the last ten a CIO. The last eighteen months have been surreal. My taxable and roll-over IRA accounts are up (combined) over 250%, invested in DAC, IIPR, AER, STOR, and NMM (recently). This morning I listened to the acquisition conference call. Nothing new discussed (the presentation last week summarized the strategic rationale well), but it was good to hear AF discuss the strategic rationale for the deal and vision for NMM. I think NMM is a strong buy and can double to triple over the next 18-24 months. The acquisition of NNA is an opportunistic purchase of a $1 billion tanker fleet when the tanker market is depressed. This should result in very attractive ROIs over the next 3-4 years as the oil market (i.e. global GDP) recovers post covid. Tanker demand should grow faster than supply over the next three years, leading to a strong recovery in pricing similar to what has occurred in the container and dry bulk markets. MNN's current EV (equity and debt) is trading almost $2 billion lower than the current value of its total fleet. $2 billion divided by 32-33 million (post transaction) shares implies a $60+ per share appreciation from the $24 share price at announcement. This assumes no further fundamental pricing improvement, just the stock price appreciating to its vessel net asset value, net of debt. NMM is a very attractive play."

one thing I have learned in my 30+ year of investing is you can't go wrong investing in a very cheap company with a lot of earnings and assets. Always eventually the market realizes the value and the stock always goes up. I am sleeping well at night being a big holder of NMM. Good luck longs.

"Because of what is happening in China we are facing further increase in steel prices, we have tried to raise prices to make up for the higher costs, but shipowners have said they are not prepared to pay, even in the current dry bulk marketShipyards have already managed to force through significant price rises to protect against an earlier hike in steel plate prices. Newbuilding price rises, averaging more than 20% in the dry bulk sector, were forced through on the back of a 105% increase in vessel contracting this year, compared with last year, according to broker Clarksons. The newbuilding boom has so far been driven by the containership market.Brokers in China say they were quoting $27m for a new kamsarmax at the start of the year compared with $35m today.But the brokers added that owners are reluctant to buy at higher prices, even though dry bulk rates are booming.A dip in ordering because of rising prices would mean that the supply of new tonnage entering the market would continue to decline.There appears to be an upcoming shortfall in tonnage in the dry bulk sector where the newbuilding orderbook only accounts for 6.4% of the capesize fleet and 6.7% of the panamax fleet.According to Clarksons’ figures, about 26.6m gt of bulk carriers were delivered into the market in 2020. This year, that figure is set to fall to 20.7m gt in 2021 and drop further to 13.8m in 2022 if there are no further orders"
This definitely screws the option calls and especially the huge December bets
"I like the acquisition. NMM is in a great place to handle the debt by paying off what the have to from cash on hand and refinancing the rest at better terms. NMM is now a MONSTER with a equal balance in 3 major shipping sectors. Nothing else like this out there. Accumulating NMCI and NNA ships for pennies on the dollar. The NMCI acquisition is worth more now than when she acquired it a year ago, The tanker sector will become very profitable again in the not distant future and she paid very nice dividends back when it was profitable. Complain all you want now but this will payoff big in the future. Roughly $4.2 billion NAV, I’m thinking around $1.4 billion debt, $1.6 billion in locked in revenue and trading at less than $600M market share. They announced an acquisition conference call for next Tuesday"
"Oversimplifying it, given the current rate environment in dry bulk and containers, won't NMM earn enough in the month of August to pay for the entire market cap of NNA (around $50 million)? I realize there is more at play here in the merger, but some of the fear about management's capital destruction that is built into the massive NMM stock discount to underlying value will be removed. Along similar lines, NM is also under $100 million market cap. Even if they were to also acquire NM, there is so much cash generation currently at NMM that they'd be able to quickly reduce the leverage of the entire enterprise and along with that shrink the discount to NAV (reduced liquidity risk, reduce interest payments, portfolio diversification to get into tankers once that sector starts to move positively next year, etc)."
"Stocks have to climb a wall of worry, There is no easy way around it. That is what makes it so hard."

"My initial thoughts: Navios needs a simpler structure. Much of the value destruction here has been driven by small, undercapitalized and overleveraged entities needing to be bailed out by other Navios entities. Collapsing NMCI and NNA under NMM makes sense...better to have one healthy and resilient entity than three sub-scale and unhealthy companies. It's not a surprise that this comes at a time that NNA has a big bond maturity coming up.So the bad news is that this management team robs from Peter to pay Paul...but outside of NM (and a South American Logistics business...I believe), the rolling up of Navios entities should be nearing its conclusion.One could argue that the #$%$ valuation reflects these risks and that the future looks brighter, but it is really tough to trust these people with your investment dollars when other alternatives exist."

NSM just got paid back a ton on the NNA acquisition so she could put in more cash which could become shares prior to a purchase.... the longer it goes and the higher the SP of NM/NMM the better off AF is when and if they combine... my only worry is NMM retains cash until she decides what she wants to do.... sounds like logistics IPO is off table for a while"

Based on the existing charter and the current rate environment (Clarksons’ 1-year time charter rate for Panamax vessels as of 1 June 2018), the vessel is expected to generate approximately US$2.3 million of EBITDA for the first year, assuming maximum redelivery period from charterers, operating expenses approximating current operating costs and 360 revenue and cost days.The acquisition of the vessel was financed with cash on the balance sheet and US$7.15 million bank debt maturing in 2023 and bearing interest at LIBOR plus 300 bps per annum."""

"Ship Owner Says Commodity Freight Rates Close to Going ParabolicBy Alex Longley(Bloomberg) -- An owner of commodity hauling freighters said rates for the ships are close to the point of spiking sharply higher and mirroring an unprecedented surge in costs for transporting manufactured goods.Spot rates for container ships to move manufactured products have surged for 20 straight weeks and now stand 731% above their seasonal average over the prior five years, according to Drewry Shipping. John Wobensmith, the president and chief executive officer of Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd., said that prices to move commodities -- which have already rallied sharply -- may follow.“You do get to a point, and you’ve seen this in containers, where you hit a certain utilization rate and you start to go parabolic on rates,” he said in an interview. “I think we’re getting close to that period.” Container rates have climbed because of snarled supply chains and extra trade that have strained the fleet’s capacity as economies emerge from the worst of Covid-19. The boom reached into every corner of the global economy because merchant fleet handles about 80% of the world’s traded goods.With more than 5 billion tons of dry commodities moved each year in so-called bulkers -- things like iron ore, coal, grains, steel and lumber -- a surge in dry freight would affect industries that produce and process everything from raw materials and crops. Rates for giant Capesize carriers had their biggest single-day surge since 2008 on Monday, reaching $52,908 a day. Wobensmith said demand is currently outpacing vessel supply, which will remain low for years with shipyard orders mostly led by container ships. Earnings remain well below the 2008 peak -- in excess of $200,000 a day just before the global recession hit -- and Wobensmith doesn’t anticipate them to get that high this time around. He also expects the situation to calm down again early next year."

@Brian - that would be difficult to justify any way you look at it. NM has an upside balance sheet and debt holders would still need to be paid.
"I’ll be curious to see the lengths/rates of dry bulk charters if AF pursues that route.I can imagine a world where containers get locked into 24-36 month contracts on a rolling basis over the next 12 months. Then dry bulk 12-24 month contracts over the next 12 months. Finally, tankers likely spot to ride any upswing.We’d see $15-20 EPS in 2022-2023 with that strategy, maybe higher and longer. Enough to increase the dividend and/or offer a share buy back in a meaningful way and limit downside risk."

I think the market's reaction to SBLK earnings and forward dividend can put to rest the belief that all NMM has to do is significantly raise the dividend and the stock would skyrocket.
"Overall today NMM seems to have held up pretty well. Especially given the increases in unit price last week. Although the BDI is down it still remains in record territory; CONTEX rate are just out of sight. These rates will have some impact between now and the end of the year and much more so in 2022. Not too clear yet what impact the NNA merger will have this year before knowing when in 4Q the deal will close. From everything I am reading it seems very likely tanker rates are increasing and that will have a positive bottom line impact in 2022 for NMM. Free cash flow next year could easily exceed $750 million and some are estimating higher still. So, $23 roughly per unit? Free cash flow at 75% of unit price. ?Pick a metric , any metric and this is just silly pricing today."

The share price drop is on small volume. This deal is great for NMM and I'm betting the SP is over $27 by the end of the month. I bought a few shares in the premarket.
Has anyone worked out the unit count after the NNA merger?
"5,452,203 new units will be issued for the merger: $150 million has already been paid to buy down NNA debt; $45 million working capital already paid; $68 million in NSM debt to be assumed and paid by January 2022.Unclear what the NNA contribution to ebitda will become.

buy low sell high. This transaction in hindsight is going to be brilliant just like the nmci transaction ended up being.

"Giveans expects stronger results from bulker companies for the second quarter, but said the ""real meaningful jump"" will be in the third quarter.As a result, although Q2 will be important, I believe the Q3 [to date] rate guidance will be even more important as it will show if owners are/are not capturing the strong rates that brokers are reporting,"" he told TradeWinds.Giveans said he expects to see higher payouts to shareholders from companies with floating dividends based on earnings or cash flow.""However, for those without dividends or those with fixed dividends, I do not expect increases (yet) as many owners remain focused on debt repayment, asset acquisitions, and building cash balances, especially with the ongoing 'market uncertainty' (which is always the case, but even more so in these Covid times),"" he explained.""That said, I do expect those with big dividend payments, or large share repurchases (which I am a big fan of), to outperform those companies who remain focused on hoarding cash or buying ships (especially newbuildings that won’t be delivered for two to four years).""Eagle Bulk, like Diana, is among the few US-listed bulker owners that analysts do not expect will declare a dividend to shareholders for the second quarter.Star Bulk Carriers looks set to declare the biggest dividend, with analysts expecting a $0.43 per share pay-out for the period, according to the consensus estimates. This would see the Greek owner paying out close to $44m to investors, if the target is matched.Eagle Bulk looks to be the big winner in terms of earnings per share for the second quarter — analysts expect the company to book EPS of $3.09."

"Giveans snippet:“ Rates for midsize Panamax bulkers (65,000-90,000 DWT) are now $34,300 per day. In May 2008, they maxed out at $91,700 per day.Rates for Supramax bulkers (45,000-60,000 DWT) are $36,300 per day, half their May 2008 peak of $70,500 per day. And rates for Handysizes (up to 35,000 DWT) are $33,900 per day, still well below the all-time high of $49,300 in May 2008 reported by Dahlman Rose.Asked to compare today's dry bulk market to the 2000s super-spike, Jefferies shipping analyst Randy Giveans told American Shipper, ""I'm not saying rates are going back to 2008 levels. What I'm saying is that this decade is going to be better than last decade. For the last decade, the BDI averaged 1,250 and was never above 2,000 for more than very short periods.""Not many of the current investors were around back in 2000-2010 and realize that the BDI can go to 10,000. No one's even seen it at over 4,000 for over a decade, so of course when they see it at 4,000, they think it's going to collapse and there's no way it can go higher. If you look at a 10-year chart, that makes sense. If you look at a 20-year chart, you realize this isn't uncharted territory at all.""I don't think the BDI will go back to 10,000, but I also don't think it will go back to an average of 1,250. I think it will be somewhere in the middle,"" said Giveans.”Benziga - Greg Miller via Freightwaves"

"finally the rate/value gap is closing... means people are buying into the sustained ratesThe incredible rally of the dry bulk market during the month of August has started to translate to higher prices in the second hand market for dry bulk carriers as well. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Intermodal said that “August was extremely hot in the dry bulk market with rates rising at levels that we have years to witness. The dry bulk index exceeded the 4,000 points mark on the 20th of August, a trend which followed an upward trajectory until the 27th of August when it reached 4,235 points. We are reminding you that the last time the dry bulk index exceeded the 4,000 points mark was back in May 2010 when the BDI reached 4209 points”.According to Intermodal’s SnP Broker, Mr. George Iliopoulos, “such an increase in the dry bulk freight market could not but affect the secondhand prices of bulker units which saw their values improve sharply within a short period of time, a trend which seems that has not yet stabilized; we see last done level of asset values being higher from their previous one. As a result of the sharp freight market improvement and the significant surge in buying interest, secondhand values have doubled since the beginning of the year."

"Considering how well the NMCI merger ended up, this could be a major winner too"
"My takeaways:Deal rationale is to opportunistically buy the tankers and to diversify the business to reduce market cycles.Debt at 35% pro forma the transaction and target it around 30%. AF mentioned that 30% can become 60% pretty quickly in this business, implying a conservative approach towards adding leverage.Dividends increases not on the table near term as the company just made a billion dollar investment (her words) and basically needs to digest it before raising dividends.Didn't want to discuss NM on an NMM call. But didn't shy away from saying they are willing to invest and do big deals."

"What does all this mean? I think it is another indirect dilution of shares? New NNA shares issued, Then NMM buys them for $3.40 ???From release: Navios Acquisition funded the redemption price using a combination of proceeds from the sale pursuant to the definitive transaction agreement of approximately 44.1 million newly issued Navios Acquisition common shares to Navios Partners in exchange for a cash contribution of $150.0 million (the “NNA Equity Issuance”) and borrowings under Navios Acquisition’s newly arranged secured term loan financings. In connection with the new financings, Navios Shipmanagement Holdings Corporation (“NSM”) released all of the collateral securing its loan to Navios Acquisition (the “NSM Loan”) and surrendered its option to exchange all or a portion of the NSM Loan for equity of Navios Acquisition’s material subsidiary, Navios Maritime Midstream Partners L.P. The released collateral was included in the collateral securing Navios Acquisition’s newly arranged secured term loan financings. In addition, NSM canceled $30.0 million of the approximately $98.1 million outstanding balance of the NSM Loan in exchange for 8.8 million newly issued common shares of Navios Acquisition. The Navios Acquisition common shares issued to NSM will be exchanged in the merger for common units of Navios Partners on the same terms applicable to the other Navios Acquisition shareholders. Any Navios Acquisition common shares owned by Navios Partners (including the shares issued pursuant to the NNA Equity Issuance) will be canceled in connection with closing of the merger for no consideration."
Did someone start a war against shipping today and I'm just not aware of it? Crazy.
Ahh dear David so it does not matter who writes about NMM but what are they writing. Any positives are fakes??? Hmm yes shipping is boom and bust business and last 10 years was a bust... Do you think this boom should last more than few months?? We are holding one of the largest shipper in the world and will be holding it for a while still....
"The news prompted a major equities sell-off since Wednesday that has caused stock prices for numerous sectors, including shipping, to tumble.""Investors think this Fed tapering will slow the economic growth and hurt spending,"" Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans told TradeWinds.He said this could certainly slow demand for bulkers and boxships and thus lower rates that have been rising for weeks amid tight supply and port congestion, but he is not too worried.""I doubt this impact will be meaningful, so much more bark than bite,"" he said.The Baltic Dry Index has improved almost 10 times over to 3,976 points on Thursday from 407 points on 15 May.The Freightos Index, which tracks boxship rates, has nearly doubled in the same timespan to 10,289 points.Stamatis Tsantanis, chief executive of pureplay capesize bulker owner Seanergy Maritime Holdings, isn't fazed either by the Fed news.Full steam ahead""My view is that this is not going to slow down any time soon — on the contrary, it is now getting started,"" he told TradeWinds.""Regarding the capesize trade, the commodities that we transport are essential for the global infrastructure projects.""He referred to the Fed's possible pullback as a ""short-term squeeze"" in a ""macro picture"" that still looks very positive for the capesize sector.""Demand and supply fundamentals remain very favourable for capesizes and I expect to see further market strengthening going forward.""The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average of five key routes, on Thursday took its second consecutive daily leap, bouncing 6.4% to $47,391 per day."

"My take on this deal is it will be good for NMM for the following reasons: The redemption of the $605M 8.125% Ship Notes, balance now at $398M, will reduce Ship Note interest by $17M+ in year 1; since NMM will be cancelling the 44.1M NNA shares they received for the $150M transferred to NNA, means that the number of NMM total shares, post merger and cancellation, will be an estimated $30.5M shares, and this includes the shares from the ATM; prior to this announcement, most NMM earnings models for all of 2022 were in the range of $24-28/sh, based on 25.2M shares= $655M in earnings at the mid-point, adjust that to add 2022 tanker profit of $135M, total combined earnings at $790M/30.5M sh= $25.90/sh in earnings, higher than todays closing SP of $25.67. Put any ridiculously AF discounted PE on these earnings and you are still going to exceed $100/sh. I don't see NMM making a play for NM, first, NM doesn't need the money as they now have strong earnings going forward, and 2nd, when NSAL finally does their IPO, NM SP should increase by $8-10. Last, NM still has too much debt for NMM to take on and still look conservatively leverage to her bankers. The 1 thing that AF continues to need is the favorable support of her bankers. Also, any deal to buy-in NM would probably require that all of the G & H Prfds be brought current, pretty significant amount."
"For those poor sods (like me) that are still long NMM and like a comforting laugh amid all this bashing: The website simplywall.st gives a fair value (based on a DCF model) of $821.61 per NMM unit. I am not joking, check it out for yourself. Now that is an undervalued stock. Or proof that DCF analysis has severe flaws."
"AF is not interested in the stability of the price of NNM, Otherwise she would declare a distribution that is fair and equitable to the unit holders.We can speculate on many reasons why. Until she hears us she has no reason to believe that anything is not fair and equitable.At the conference call I thought that someone would bring up that question.I thought wrong, no one brought up the question or even attempted to address the situation regarding distributions to the unit holders.The blame is on us and AF.The unit holders should be speaking up.AF should be more responsible to the unit holders even if we don’t speak up.We are partners and we should not be silent especially during the conference when we have a voice.."
I have an attempt at running numbers - feel free to add your input and comment....2013-2015 were excellent for distributions but it just drops of a cliff....gives some insight to as why AF may be more cautious currently. Also provides hope in the sense she is willing to distribute high %'s. Totally different company now also - revenue alone in 2022 could eclipse that of 2013 - 2017 (tankers incl.) naturally this will lean to a more stable div policy - but as AF says it should be able to reduce the cyclical nature of it.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ab1Bo-xIfgBYR5LYRPTPA5xOrGzMPCYypMSQbX5uBgM/edit#gid=0
Wonder if NMM pps will follow a similar trajectory as it did after the NMCI merger?
"@Tape660 without a filing for the NMM ATM share count, my guess is 32.5 million outstanding after the merger. Even if the market continues the “AF discount” on NMM, units should trade around $60. That would still be less than half of NAV and a big upside from here. When dividends are improved the unit price should adjust higher from there."
"Currently, NMM is priced at 1.6x mid-range earnings estimates. Seems like a bargain here."
David - stop littering the NMM and NM boards… it makes you look so desperate.
"Recent container ship sold:Post Panamax ER Denmark (5,990 TEU, Jul 2002, Samsung) sold for USD 43.50 mil, VV value USD 48.25 mil.A nearly 20 year old ship at the end of it’s life cycle selling for that price! Now apply that to NMM’s fleet. Similar prices are being paid for dry bulk ships, as well. I wonder what the net value of the fleet is currently worth? I’ve said this before, pick your metric and do you believe NMM’s units are pried correctly?"

"Those who were blaming AF for the stock price going down, should be applauding her for the stock going up today. Or should just admit that NMM is moving in total sync with the whole dry bulk sector, as all dry bulk charts a looking identical over the past 2 days. As soon as hedge funds realize that rising delta case will not hurt dry bulk shipping this time around (as the world economy will still function, but the shipping logistics will be less efficient and hence the rates will stay higher), the whole dry bulk sector will start trending up, and so will NMM. No need to bring AF into this equation."
"This is still crazy cheap. It can double from here and still be crazy cheap. $4.22B in assets and debt of $ 1.472B. Divided by 31M shares and you have $88.64 per unit. Not including cash on hand and $1.6B in locked in revenue. Getting the tankers business, when those assets are near bottom prices, just adds more to the potential. This is the best position NMM has ever been in and it’s trading likes it’s close to the worst. Locked in container business at great rates for 2-3 years and continuing to recharter at higher rates. Dry bulk doing very well and she’s looking to lock down those rates. Tankers has no where to go but up from here and that looks like a big possibility in the not so distant future. AF looking like she’s aligning her self with unit holders and becoming a major unit holder herself through all of these acquisitions. She’s always paid a decent dividend when the time is right. Seems like she has some more work she wants to get done before that happens. glta"
"Honestly wasn’t sure what to think of the acquisition at first, but I have warmed up to it. If you think an asset is severely undervalued and you can sure up some of its cracks, why not buy it? Further, if car prices and gas prices are leading indicators, the value of these ships are likely to continue their rise"
"This is an update to my post of yesterday afternoon on the pending merger of NNA into NMM and projected earnings for 2022. Several replies questioned how I arrived at NNA's earnings for 2022, since 1Q2021 showed a loss of $0.59/sh. I went back and re-did my model for NNA for 2022, using 44 ships in 1H2022, and 45 ships 2H2022. I used a more conservative assumption on rates for 2022 on all ships coming off charter or on index, all fixed charters were entered at that rate. Revised est. revenue for NNA for 2022 came in at $316,100,000 + est. reduction in expenses post merger of $20,000,000= $336,100,000 revenue, less total 2022 expenses est. at $229,000,000 (calculated on $14,300/day/ship, not including principle repayments)= $107,100,000 est. earnings. So, my 1st estimate of $135M, as the Mets announce used to say, ""was just a little bit high"". Still, NMM's adjusted 2022 earnings are now est. at $762.1M, and that is most likely low considering the action in DB & containership rates. Also, I expect the same type of 1 time hit to earnings (non-cash) as happened on the close of the NMCI merger to reflect gains in equity and bargain purchase gain. NNA's Book Value is $18.84/sh, which NMM is getting for $3.40/sh, just as there was an upward adjustment in the share conversion with NMCI, I think there is a good chance for the same to happen here. It wouldn't surprise me to see the offer of $3.40 go to $4.00."
