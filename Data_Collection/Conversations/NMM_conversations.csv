containers rates up again... everytime i post it gets deleted one year almost 97 2 year almost 67
"Normally I would prefer share appreciation to a dividend, as I pay tax on the latter, but not on the former. Here, the problem is that share appreciation will be less if she pays no dividend even if that is not logical. Unless you think a $ in the company is worth less than a dollar paid out to shareholders although I cannot think of another investment with a similar IRR."
"Container rates keep raising. 1.5 year streak continues. 4250 TEU's, 12 Month $96,390, 24 month $65,885. just a year ago, we were all cheering for a 1 year daily rate in the $18,000 and hoping AF would lock those down. Now, some of those charters are coming up for renewal. That's over $28M in additional profit per containership based on one year daily rate."

Thanks E A for sharing your opinion. I have another to ask... What about US green initiative ie investing in green futurw. I read somewhere that only to built infrastructure for it would require huge amount of various minerals....Any thoughts or numbers to share???
"Navios Maritime Acquisition chairwoman and CEO Angeliki Frangou said: “About one-third of our fleet will be in each of the dry bulk, containership and tanker segment.“We believe that this combination should result in a stronger, more resilient entity, mitigating sector-specific cyclicality, and enabling us to capitalise on opportunities throughout the industry and provide even returns to our stakeholders across cycles.”i guess she is confident she can maintain the .05 per quarter haha"
"Look at 3 month chart, higher lows and higher highs. This downdraft is expected and healthy."
"Tankers - week of 10/23/2021:VLCCThere is a palpable feel in the VLCC market that we are heading in to a firmer winter market, as sentiment amongst owners continues to build. So far, no major jumps, as the MEG has continued in the same vein, despite other areas pushing an upward trend. So far charterers have been able to find an alternative, be it an ex dd, or a vintage vessel etc. But, we have had 2 months of 120+ fixtures and November looks healthy. Still, the Atlantic is leading the charge. On the UKC, traders chasing bbls off ppt-ish dates (VL’s working same dates as Afra’s). If no VL’s are there at the right price, we could see Afra/Suez rates jump further as stems are split. More Atlantic volume will encourage modern ships to ballast from the East on speculation, giving the MEG a tighter feel it has not had in a while. An interesting week ahead.Fearnleys"
"The second quarter presentation used $32k for the combined dry bulk rate at that point in time. Total open/index days for the second half was 5643: $180 million just for dry bulk index linked dry bulk for 3Q and 4Q. Clearly the average used is way off based on today’s rates. After the merger with NNA, AF was projecting $1.5 billion revenue in 2022 based on then current rates. Where that was also based on 63% open/index linked days is $2.5 billion in revenue achievable next year using today’s rates?"
"short interest 0.29 percent, practically non existent. I think the pessimists on this board are hoping to drive down the price to buy more."

"Gotta feel good about future tanker rates:Gas Shortage Prompts Power Plants to Switch to Oil, Boosting DemandIEA expects energy crunch to lift oil demand above pre-pandemic levels next year The world’s thirst for oil is likely to exceed pre-pandemic levels next year, the IEA said.Soaring natural-gas and coal prices are pressuring power-generation companies and manufacturers to switch to using oil, a trend that could add half a million barrels a day to global demand, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.In its monthly market report, the IEA increased its global oil-demand forecasts for this year and the next by 170,000 and 210,000 barrels a day, respectively, but added that the cumulative effect of the energy crisis could be as large as 500,000 barrels a day from September through next year’s first quarter.That increase means that the IEA, which acts as the energy watchdog for the wealthy nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expects the world’s thirst for crude next year to exceed pre-pandemic levels at 99.6 million barrels a day.And further in the article:Analysts say the IEA’s forecast of an extra 500,000 barrels a day in demand from the energy crisis may be conservative.“We have never had a situation like this where oil is extremely cheap [versus gas] so we just don’t have empirical evidence” for how much oil demand may increase, said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets. “It could very well be more than a million barrels,” he added.WSJ Journal (10/14/2021)"

"The market for capesize bulkers should continue declining amid lower iron-ore and steel production for the rest of 2021, according to brokers.The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average weighted across five key routes, slid 4.9% on Thursday to $57,374 per day, making for a rapid decline of 34% over the past two weeks.The paper market pointed to even lower rates well into next year's first quarter, according to Baltic Exchange data.The forward freight agreement (FFA) rate fell steadily over the next five months to $23,057 per day for February after losing $622 per day.Lower iron-ore guidance for 2021 from behemoths Vale and Rio Tinto and China's plans to curb steel production are weighing on market sentiment, said Rebecca Galanopoulos Jones, head of research at London broking house Alibra Shipping.""The latest figures from the World Steel Association forecast that for 2021 as a whole, steel production will contract by 1% from last year, with growth in 2022 expected to be flat,"" she told TradeWinds.Lower iron-ore guidance may cause capesize bulker rates to keep falling, brokers say.

"China is unleashing its coal sector in a bid to ease its worst power crunch in two decades. Beijing has ordered all coal mines to operate at full capacity and taken other steps to roll back record-high coal prices heading into the winter, the WSJ’s Chuin-Wei Yap reports, as it reverses course on earlier ambitions to curb coal use. China is also loosening imports of the electricity-generating fuel as part of the set of actions that will roil energy markets and may give a boost to the bulk-commodities shipping sector. Beijing’s push to meet tougher environmental standards by limiting coal production in a country that consumes half the world’s supply has aggravated a global shortage of the commodity. At Chinese ports, importers have already been able to unload Australian coal, signaling a potential end to a yearlong ban on the trade, although the cargoes haven't yet cleared customs.WSJ Logistics Report"
"Dry bulk shipowners are not rushing to the yards to order new tonnage, despite enjoying a booming sector in which spot rates have doubled in the past month.They are instead looking to secondhand ships for asset play to remain nimble in the sales-and-purchase market while waiting for pending environmental regulations to take hold.""If you buy a secondhand ship — maybe you made a booboo maybe you feel uncomfortable with it — you go into the secondhand market and you get rid of it,"" Goodbulk chief executive John Michael Radziwill said.""With the newbuilding, you're like a deer in front of headlights.""Secondhand ships allow owners to fix a secondhand vessel at $40,000 per day right now instead of waiting two years to get maybe $15,000 per day on a newbuilding order, he said.""You have tons of optionality,"" he said on Tuesday as a panellist for a talk on dry bulk shipping at Capital Link's 13th annual New York Maritime Forum.The three-day conference is being held online to Thursday afternoon for Covid-19 safety.""I see no reason to oversupply our market,"" he said.""The reason why we're in this place is because we had restrained on newbuilding orders, so don't go out and make the same mistake now.""Spot rates for capesize bulkers have reached highs unseen since 2008 amid a perfect storm of low supply, high demand and supply-chain disruption.The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average weighted across five key routes, fell 3.9% to $79,535 on Tuesday, according to Baltic Exchange data.That is still almost double what it was a month ago at $40,518 per day on 8 September.New regulations on the wayOwners should hold off on ordering new tonnage since regulations will probably require zero-emission ships by 2050, said Gary Vogel, chief executive of Eagle Bulk Shipping.""I think every newbuilding decision is a decarbonisation opportunity,"" he said.""Waiting and understanding what's available in terms of zero-emission ships in just a couple of years I think is a huge opportunity, and I think we all should focus on that opportunity.""In the meantime, owners should minimise carbon emissions from secondhand ships through slow steaming and other measures, said Martyn Wade, chief executive of Grindrod Shipping.""It doesn't make any sense at the moment to speed up,"" he said.""Demand is there, and we are satisfying the demand in the best way we can.""Seanergy Maritime Holdings, a pureplay capesize owner, has invested $160m this year on six secondhand ships while selling one ship to expand its fleet to 16 capesizes.Chief executive Stamatis Tsantanis said his company is waiting to see new advancements in carbon reduction before it starts committing to newbuilding orders.""Once we have clarity on what's going to be the technology of tomorrow and what's going to be the prevailing ship — the model of which we still don't feel comfortable as a company —then we can consider on the basis of financial returns if that makes sense or not,"" he said"
"For the tanker portion:The recent leg higher for crude has come in sympathy with a surge by natural gas. Rising natural-gas prices have prompted increased demand for crude, particularly in China and other Asian countries, as utilities switch gas- and coal-powered generators to oil.Energy commodities “can’t go up every day and we can expect this sector to remain volatile. But the bottom line is that supply remains limited and demand is robust, and if we get an early and cold start to winter, we should be prepared for much higher energy commodity prices,” said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note.MarketWatch"

"Sim reported they purchased 7 ships in October for $320 million. Their ages were 2007-2009. The per TEU price paid was $13,646. Realizing NMM’s has a younger average age and the fleet likely has a higher TEU valuation, the Zim price paid would value NMM’s fleet at $3 billion. 55 dry bulk and 43 tankers added in and the valuation of this company several times higher than the current pps."

"It is difficult to forecast where spot rates will go amid such volatility, but they could lose another $20,000 per day by next month, if not December, Kartsonas said.""When all is done and settled, I do believe November and December averages will have a 3 in front,"" he said.""I do believe the smaller size vessels will act as resistance once the spot approaches such a level.""Australia's Rio Tinto plans to hire a to-be-named 170,000-dwt capesize to ship iron ore from Australia to China at $14.10 per tonne during the first half of November.The freight rate for a capesize on the benchmark Australia-China route lost $1.24 per tonne on Friday to come in at $14.264 per tonne.The capesize sector had a ""pretty bleak week"" amid falling demand in China and less production in rain-soaked Brazil, but the paper market has been signalling a decline, said Nick Ristic, lead dry cargo analyst.""FFAs (forward freight agreement rates) are certainly pricing a fall below $50,000 per day very soon, but the curve has been heavily backwardated for quite some time, so I don’t think you can say it was unexpected,"" he told TradeWinds.""The fundamentals would suggest that we’ll see things continue to slide into the first quarter of 2022, but as always with capes, we can’t rule out a fourth-quarter spike.""Stamatis Tsantanis, chief executive of pureplay capesize owner Seanergy Maritime Holdings, chalked up the falling spot rates to the volatile nature of this particular dry bulk sector.""The market went up too high too fast and now it is correcting to these levels,"" he told TradeWinds.""We do not see any material changes in demand-supply fundamentals.

"Short of some new black swan event, I don’t see rates coming down significantly until maybe 3Q 2022. By then I would think AF would have dry bulk and containers signed with relatively high rate long-term contracts. Tankers will begin improving this quarter I would think. Unclear how much improvement there will be over the next few quarters. However, NNA was profitable in 2Q and one would have to think that part of the business will only improve in 2022. Also considering AF has already projected $1.5 billion next year revenue, it makes me wonder why NMM is struggling to advance. The only negative that I can see is the absence of any clarity around dividends.For all intents and purposes NNA is already a sub of NNM creating a NAV in excess of $4 billion or said differently the per unit value north of $100. So at a current unit price of $30, what’s wrong with this picture?"
"Missing Brian's early BDI rate posts prior to general availability so I looked it up myself.

"Sept. 28th the Capesize daily rate was under $70,000 per day and NMM was trading @ $32.80. Today still over $70,000 per day rate and it’s at ￼￼$28 because of the drop? That’s a drop of over $100m Market Cap. FYI, The Capesize daily rate was trading at less than $40,000 per day with NMM having a higher market cap than this. What’s else is off, the containerships are just starting to get into their higher rates with an additional 7 more ships rates to be reset over the next few months. Both of these 2 cylinders are firing at levels not seen in a long time and one of them (containerships) is set to fire at this level for at least 2 -3 years. When NNA comes on board, they are atleast currently making a profit at these depressed rate. If those rates go up, this would be a massive increase in revenue and profit. FYI, the dividends￼ will come, I’ve made a ton on AF’s dividends in the past, She’s being very cautious this time around. She made promises before about dividends and when the rates dropped and they were on spot rates, she had to do a 180. That’s when investors started to not trust her. Not trying to take her side here. She had to do what she had to do to survive. That’s why she’s being very cautious this time. She wants to lock in those rates first. That’s what she said her goal was with the dry bulk vessels on her last conference call. This is one of the best opportunities I’ve seen in a long time and I know she will pay a decent dividend when the time is right. That’s not a guess, that’s based on my passed history with NMM."

"Week ending 10/29/2021:Dry BulkCapesizeThe market has fallen sharply the last week as the amount of available tonnage in the East has increased and charterers holding back taking advantage of the negative sentiment. The West Australia rout with iron ore to China is down by 28%, now giving owners a time charter hire of 31,850 per day. The iron ore rout from Brazil to China is down by 26%. The overall basket is down by 34% indicating that the more illiquid routs has come off harder than where there is a more constant flow of cargo. This might indicate that there have been a lot of panic in the Capesize segment, and time of writing there is some signs of support, though still very nervous.PanamaxThis week the Panamax market has not shown any clear direction, but the underlying sentiment is negative. Rates are coming off in both hemispheres, although not to the same extent as the bigger Capesizes. P1A is currently trading around the 36k mark, while in the Pacific we see rounds being concluded at around 37/38k. The period market is currently lacking activity, much affected by the FFA market.Fearnleys"
100 ships backlogged in California! Apparently 45 more are scheduled in tomorrow. That's a massive floating warehouse. Doesn't look as though container rates will be coming down any time soon.

"next week's conference should be a great time. All the CEOs set to speak, time for gloating. Coming out of a 12 year bear market in shipping is very profitable."
about time for the presser on earnings release... perhaps today for next wed/thurs?or will the NNA merger push it back a bit?
While container ships sit off port waiting to be unloaded goods are stacking up waiting to be shipped creating a backlog which will extend this rally even further. While these container ships sit and wait to be unloaded they are paid big money and they are burning no fuel that means even higher profits.
"I actually hope AF keeps the dividend at 5 cents. Ali would much rather they buy back stock for 30 cents on the dollar. That would dramatically improve the stock price. However, shipping companies have been burned badly in the past, so now they are being much more prudent and conservative by paying down debt first. Imagine the dividend they can pay in 12-18 months when close to debt free. AF emphatically stated this is a growth stock, not income stock. If you want income now, there are plenty of alternatives. If you want a boatload of income in 2 years, load up on NMM while you can accumulate shares so cheap."
"Week ending 10/29/2021:VLCCIt has been a couple of weeks with steady increase in rates for the VLCCs. Driven initially by an active West market where charterers with long haul voyages to cover tapping up eastern ballasters, with ships open in the Atlantic hard to come by. East of Suez also busy but with a position list filled with vintage ships or ex dd, the rates are not going through the roof quite yet. However, with owners’ sentiment strong, the rates are expected to increase as we move further into mid November laycan ex MEG.

"Booming spot rates for capesize bulkers may prompt charterers to start using panamaxes as a cheaper alternative to carry commodities, according to brokers.The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average weighted across five key routes, on Thursday came in at $74,176 per day after losing $610 per day, according to Baltic Exchange data.The panamax 5TC, by comparison, reached $36,119 per day after shedding $216 per day.Instances of charterers hiring two panamaxes instead of one capesize are ""still limited"" despite the rate disparity, according to Derek Langston, head of research at UK-based brokerage house Simpson Spence Young.""In addition, the Atlantic basin feels over-tonnaged in the panamax sector, so limiting the upside in the immediate term,"" he told TradeWinds.""The Pacific provides the main upside potential for panamaxes, however, with stem splitting starting to appear at the end of September.""Chiba Shipping has fixed the 84,790-dwt MG Kronos (built 2016) to Cobelfret at $40,000 per day for a 2 October voyage from China to South Korea via New Zealand with the intention to carry coal.Brokers said they are not aware of capesize stems being split into panamaxes yet, but the idea is getting thrown around in the market."
How will US infrastructure investments impact dry freight rates?? Any thoughts to share??
"Fleet newsA look at the supply side of the container shipping market confirms carriers’ desperation to get hold of tonnage. Looking at the shipbuilding yards, 386 ships with a total capacity of 3.4 million TEU have been ordered so far this year. This has filled the yards for 2023 and 2024, when 1.6m TEU and 1.5m TEU respectively are scheduled for delivery. A further 375,000 TEU is already scheduled for delivery in 2025 as delivery earlier than this becomes harder to secure.The most popular container ships on order are those with a capacity of 13,000 to 16,999 TEU. 146 ships of this size with a total capacity of 2.1m TEU have been ordered so far this year. In the 20,000+ TEU ULCS range, 22 ships with a total capacity of 0.5m TEU have been ordered.Fleet growth is expected to slow down in 2022, before the many ships ordered at the end of 2020 and in 2021 are delivered, prompting a return to higher fleet growth in 2023 to 2025.OutlookYears of low freight rates resulting in rigorous cost cutting by carriers have left them in a great position to maximize profits now that the market has turned. Looking to the future, they have proven adept at using their upper hand at the negotiating table to lock shippers into longer-term contracts at today’s higher freight rates.Similarly, tonnage providers had the upper hand with charterers. By early September, chartering a 3,500 TEU ship would cost USD 77,000 per day, while chartering an 8,500 TEU ship cost USD 115,000 per day (source: Harper Petersen). In addition to attractive higher charter rates, tonnage providers are managing to secure longer-term contracts. In recent weeks, however, the steep rise in charter rates has stopped, but this is more a reflection of the lack of tonnage available for charter rather than falling demand.BIMCO expects the container market will remain strong well into 2022. Even as consumer demand for containerized goods begins to ease, there will be plenty of work to be done in clearing the backlog that has built up over the past many months, and lots of stocks that need to be restocked. The true test for the container shipping market will likely come in 2023, when the huge volumes of newbuilt shipping capacity ordered over the past year starts being delivered. Once this happens, the strength of the contracts currently signed may be tested as shippers and carriers, attracted by lower freight and charter rates, will try and get out of their obligations, as is always the case when a market recalibrates to a very different level.Before this happens, however, the world will continue to watch the container shipping industry and its ability to deliver on its promise of delivering global trade, even though the bottlenecks preventing a return to normal are mostly outside of carriers’ controls in ports and warehouses. As proven by the increasing list of ships waiting to berth at the ports of Los Angeles, carriers adding more capacity doesn’t solve the problems on land.The situation may get worse before it gets better. As long as China continues to pursue a zero-tolerance COVID-19 elimination strategy, the risk of more ports being closed or disruptions to hinterland connections remains high, adding to the time it that will take for the container shipping market to normalize.At the top of everyone’s list will be ensuring schedule reliability and a return to the status quo in which the sea-transport of goods returns to smooth sailing, and not the current headache-provoking situation, albeit potentially at higher freight rates than shippers had enjoyed in the past decade.Maritime Logistics"

Contacted by TradeWinds, managers of the Japanese company said they do not own the vessel and cannot therefore comment on the information of it being sold.The true seller appears to have a good deal on its hands.VesselsValue estimates the Cape Garland's indicative market price at $29.2m. The Signal Ocean dry bulk platform puts it at $28m and MSI Horizon at between $26.8m and $31.7m.The price appears even stronger when one considers that the Cape Garland is not equipped with a scrubber and last passed special survey in December 2018.Even older vessels are commanding impressive prices in the current market. Greece’s Alcyon is said to have fetched $15.75m for the 170,100-dwt capesize Bluemoon (built 2002)."
"If I were to define what NMM is, I would call it a growing partnership. We have grown In price per unit, expanded from dry bulk to containers and tankers and now it’s time to grow with the dividend. When A F expanded the segments of the company to protect the company from volatility it showed that growing the two more segments would alleviate volatility. The dividend/distribution is another way to stabilize the volatility And appreciate the unit price. We will soon find out her true ambitions and be able to determine if her goal is grandiose, or comprehensive."
Any reasonable investors could not sell navios at this price . If you do work you will selling your share less than 2 times of earning and the worst case less than 5 times earning.

"rices for dry bulk carriers could soon rally, following hot on the heels of the latest rally of the dry bulk market freight rates. Despite last week’s correction, shipbrokers appear to be quite optimistic regarding a renewed rebound in asset prices as well.In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Allied Shipbroking said that “the final quarter of the year started “with a bang” for the bigger size segment, with the benchmark TCA figure reaching new highs, while reaching close to its 2009 peak. A hefty trajectory for a segment that has been the year-to-date underperformer in the dry bulk market. Can this trigger another round of increase in asset prices as well? Using asset prices for 5-year old vessels as a benchmark, current price levels seem to be on the low side. This point is further enhanced, given the roughly US$ 10mill price gap with the 2009 levels. The question is as to whether 2021 is at a discount or was 2009 an exaggeration? It is possible that the answer lies somewhere in-between”."

"Dry Bulk Market: Capesize Market Rally Continues Unabatedin Dry Bulk Market, International Shipping News 11/10/2021CapesizeThe Capesize market continued its bull rally this week as we move into the tail-end quarter of the year. The Capesize 5TC managed a high of $86,953 on Thursday before closing out the week on a softer note at $83,865. Throughout the earlier part of the week the Pacific basin rose in tandem with the Atlantic on strong sentiment. But was seen to soften as the week ended leaving the Atlantic paying a significant premium. The Transatlantic C8 closed at $95,550 to the Transpacific C10 at $77,692. The Backhaul C16 lifted a shocking +16,175 over the week to close at $62,650. In this prime earning period owners are reluctant to lock in precious time performing positioning cargoes. The opportunity cost of forgoing higher paying fixtures is forcing charterers to make substantial lifts to their bids. The Fronthaul C9, on the higher end of the value spectrum, is reaching well into the six digit levels now as the route closes the week at $118,950. The Capesize market remains well supported and very active. While the market softened slightly towards the end of the week, there appears little sign that the fireworks are coming to an end."

"technicals look good if we stay over $27. 50. Within 2 weeks all the shipping companies will be releasing earnings and they will be phenomenal. The outlook for the next year will be even better, NMM is forecast to have over $16 eps for 2022. With a NAV close to $100 per share, I see no downside and we may hopefully go to the moon."
couple large blocks yesterday and today...
"Folks, is anyone following closely the orderbook for container ships? Is a flood of them really coming in 2023 that would crush the rates?"
"I would encourage everyone to listen to the analysts forum, the last forum on the third day. 6 shipping analysts all very optimistic with good reasons to back it up, NMM was actually mentioned. I listened to AF, she said by being diversified and getting leverage down in the 20% area NMM would become a much more stable company and when one sector was in the dumps they would be able to take full advantage of cheap assets, where pure plays cannot. I found it interesting that the analysts said such a structure with low leverage and mentioned 20% would in the long run, their words, eat the lunch of the pure plays. They all agreed that investors and hedge funds at this time don't like that because they want a short term play and want to try and time the market, but mutual funds where the big money is will start catching on. So once we get our leverage where AF wants it we can have a stable company with a stable dividend and a stock price that reflects that. So if you want boom and bust with an unstable dividend take your money out of here and find a pure play and hope you time it right so you don't give it all back. Call me crazy but I now think AF knows what she is doing, and I can wait another couple of quarters for a more stable company with a fair stable dividend and a good share price and a company that can get through all cycles."
"Part of that is due to fears around China shutting down due to an energy crisis, but rates falling should be expected as the forward curve is showing rates will be lower in the coming weeks and months,"" Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans told TradeWinds.""All that said, capesize rates are still at incredible levels.""A scarcity of cargoes in the Atlantic Basin is also weighing down on capesize rates, according to Baltic Exchange market analysts.""However, some owners still showed a bit of resistance and optimism for having an improved return as tonnage remained relatively starved,"" the Baltic Exchange said on Thursday in its daily report on the dry bulk market.Paper marketThe forward curve for capesizes is trending below the physical market, despite showing slight gains on Thursday.The forward freight agreement (FFA) rate for October picked up $322 per day to reach $69,179 per day, while the November figure jumped $1,178 per day to $49,571 per day.The FFA rate for the fourth quarter improved $661 per day to $53,024 per day.For all of 2022, it gained $392 per day on Thursday to achieve $28,509 per day.Tough week for dry bulk, boxship stocks despite buoyant ratesRead moreCapesize bulker spot rates fall into correction territoryRead moreCapesize bulker rates may drop to 'higher low' amid falling demandRead moreThe New York-listed bulker equities are falling with the dropping capesize rates, but they have disconnected from the forward curve, Giveans said.""Equities were much higher when the 2022 FFA curve was $24,000 per day, compared to today’s $28,000 per day,"" he told TradeWinds.""All that being said, we remain bullish on dry bulk, especially going into what should be a very strong and bullish earnings season."""

"@E A as a side note, while shipyards are building containers, the other sectors are not able to get new buildings. That would bode well not just for drybulk, but also the tanker segment, as well. 2022 is shaping up to be a really good year for NMM."
"Major Greek owner Angeliki Frangou has rejected criticism about her newly consolidated Navios being a hotch-potch of assets and defended its diversified nature as the way to go forward.Stifel analyst Ben Nolan used the word ‘conglomerate’ to describe bulker and containership Navios Maritime Partners, which became the largest US-listed company by vessel count earlier this month after gobbling up affiliated tanker player Navios Maritime Acquisition.Interviewed in Athens by Clarksons Platou analyst Omar Nokta, however, Frangou said that label was off the mark."" 'Conglomerate' is a collection of unrelated businesses,"" Frangou told a MarineMoney conference on Wednesday — the first to take place in physical attendance since February last year.""Basically the same skill set applies to all businesses,"" from containers to bulkers and tankers, Frangou added.""I will not call it a conglomerate, I'll call it a blue-water maritime transportation company with the advantage of getting even returns while you have uneven performance in the different segments,"" Frangou said.Navios Maritime Partners should rather be considered a ""diversified and sustainable proxy for world trade"" that works well as ""a good hedge on inflation as well,"" she said.Dispensing with the traditional pure-play model, which she described as ""challenged"", allows her to focus on earnings optimisation and more flexibility in chartering and acquisitions, she stressed.Earnings from booming bulkers and containerships represented a ""strong currency"" to buy up the Navios Acquisition tanker fleet, which is currently at the low part of the cycle.In a sentiment shared by other conference participants, Frangou said she also expected tanker markets to pick up as global travel recovers from the pandemic, even though it was difficult to say when exactly.""To judge from the number of people who have traveled to come to this conference… I think the tanker sector will do well.""Shareholders seem to share Frangou's optimism. Navios Partners shares appreciated considerably since the Navios merger deal, at a faster clip than pure-play bulker or boxship peers."
"NAV discountThe lag effect means bulker owners including Genco Shipping & Trading, Star Bulk Carriers, Navios Maritime Partners and Eagle Bulk Shipping are trading at big discounts to NAV, according to Giveans.""These reduced equity prices could/should be a good thing if companies take advantage by repurchasing shares,"" he said.In Oslo, DNB Bank estimates Golden Ocean's NAV at NOK 99 ($11.74) per share, but the stock closed NOK 16.75 below this level on Friday last week and was trading at around $9.75 on the Nasdaq bourse.Last week, DNB raised its target price for Golden Ocean to NOK 133 after revising its one-year forward forecast for asset prices, in light of better-than-expected freight rates.For investors, Giveans thinks there is still plenty of value to be squeezed out of bulker stocks.""Obviously, the best opportunities were a year ago before the stocks tripled to current prices,"" he told TradeWinds.""That said, [there is] still a lot of upside, as there remains a large disconnect between elevated rates and strong asset values versus undervalued equities.""Looking ahead, Giveans thinks ""cooler heads will prevail as rates stabilise in the coming weeks"" but believes earnings season will help with optimism.""I think this upcoming round of [third-quarter] earnings calls will be robust, with blow-out quarters, strong guidance and big dividends."

I want to over eat and drink to much too, like I'm doing tonight. But in the long run that is not good for me. I may turn out to be dead wrong, wouldn't be the first time, but I just think AF is on the right track. Those who have been here longer then I have would say finally, but better late then never.

"@Stas - supply and demand would beg to differ with your thesis. I believe AF has already stated she won't increase the dividend for the 3rd quarter so that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Maybe something in 4Q? Certainly by 1Q next year. None of the major analysts have actually updated their estimates so far as I can find to represent what NMM looks like today. They all show NMM earnings for 2022 at around $14-$15. That's slightly above where NMM will close out 2021. You have already stated NMM is on its way to $10/unit. Anything can happen I suppose. However, the current facts indicate a higher ups coming."

"In the past, distributions have been announced late in the month following the ending of the quarter, about the 28th or the 29th day I believe the next Thursday and Friday are the 28th and 29th of October and we may see an announcement. Even if the distribution goes up by five cents, that would be a 100% increase in the quarterly distributions. That would make quite a headline.

Navios Maritime Partners L.P is up 8.00% to 31.06
IMHO I think AF will hold NM as the parent an NMM as the L.P.. She will not list Logistics (NSAL) but keep it in NM. Because the shipping market has changed so much this year it just does not make financial sense to include NM at this time into NMM IMHO. Especially because of the tax issue not to mention her benefit on the loan interest. AJMHO.

"Now that the NNA merger is now complete, what's in store for the dividend? I'm not saying she won't raise it this quarter somewhat but I don't expect a larger increase until possibly the quarter afterwards. She said she wanted leverage in the 20% range. Here is a take away from the press release today when listing some of the advantages of the merger.Maintains significant financial flexibility with a combined modest leverage ratio of approximately 35%, based upon the average of publicly available broker reports as of August 20, 2021, and a large collateral value base for refinancing debt maturities.Enhances credit profile by increasing cash retention to support growth and continued deleveraging.She wants to get that leverage in the 20's which will make refinancing especially with the diversity very easy in both good times and bad."
"Spent hours listening to the CEO's on the New York Maritime Forum. All the CEO's in containers say the good times are going to last for quite some time. The CEO's in dry bulk said basically the same thing. The CEO's in tankers say the market is starting to turn now and will get hot quickly, not months, weeks. Everybody agrees they don't want new builds and the order book is low and will stay that way . Many CEO's said we need rates to stabilize and even pull back somewhat to prevent inflation which is what could kill the consumer and demand. Every CEO in every sector said their customers are wanting long term contracts, 3-5 years which is great for stability. Some said they have been holding back on the dividend in order to firm up their balance sheets and that unit holders and shareholders have been patient and now it's time to start taking care of them. Let's hope our CEO feels that way. So if you are short you are going to have a long road ahead of you. I hope to listen to NMM interview tomorrow when playback is available. Unless they are all wrong we are in for a pretty good period ahead."

"The reason for low volume and dropping prices is that investors are reluctant to sell their shares without further evidence of earnings and distributions to the shareholders or unit holders.We could see a quick reversal in the current trend coming up.

They may believe that this is their only opportunity, because after the dividend/Distribution investors will be reluctant to part with their shares for quite a while."

So she bought the containers, I should say stole them for next to nothing just before they boomed to bail herself out? You're saying she bought the tankers at a sweet price just before they are about to boom to bail herself out? Did you ever think that what made those two deals great was because of the fact that we already owned a mess of shares making it a done deal. Didn't have to get into a bidding war, shareholder approval was a done deal, and we will bail out NM, do you want to know how? She's going to give a decent dividend which they will receive 10% of and then everyone will be happy. There is a lot of other shipping stocks, if you don't like this one move on. Getting rid of weak hands that don't understand what is going on will lower volatility."
"Dry bulk - week of 10/23/2021:CapesizeCapesizes slowly improving again after a big correction over the last week. C5 found support in the low 16s and is now getting closer to USD 17 pmt. C3 is trading on thin volume and is marked at USD 39 whilst value for more prompt ships is in the low to mid 40s. The average TC is at 60,000 which is still a solid number, but certainly expected higher.PanamaxThe Panamax market continued its positive trend from last week and we see better than last done being concluded in both hemispheres. The P1A has gained about USD 5k w-o-w and now trading in the mid 30’s region. In the Pacific, Nopac rounds are being concluded at above 40k basis North China delivery.Fearnleys"
"Big conference today thru Thursday. Yesterday finally broke down and bought some NM and ZIM. So now shipping is like 30 percent of my total portfolio. In descending order of position size I now own NMM, DAC, GSL, KEN, ZIM and NM. Good luck longs, we are 1 year in to a multi year bull market. The massive earnings are finally starting to roll in and are going to continue for a while."
One way for security or the stock market for that matter to stay still is just to bounce back-and-forth. I believe that’s where we are until distributions are announced in the earnings are announced.
"Ready for a squeeze? Capesize FFAs poised for volatility due to urgent hedgingThe capesize derivatives market finds itself in a situation that would have seemed unthinkable a month agoFreight derivatives for capesize bulk carriers have seen an almighty sell-off over the past week, but now options holders are quickly finding themselves exposed to losses.It is a situation that would have been unthinkable just over a month ago.The kryptonite in the capesize forward freight agreement (FFA) market is the relatively large volumes of call options that have been struck in the last couple of weeks at prices between $27,000 and $35,000 per day for November and December contracts.These were likely bought early in the year, when there was a more bullish outlook to the market — all of which changed around a month ago, when concerns surrounding China's economy and commodity demand intensified.If the market moves below these levels, this exposes the sellers of those calls to the downside.And during the day's trading on Tuesday, it seemed as though the moment had come. Bidding for November contracts was at $29,800 per day and for December contracts was around $26,500 per day.One trader likened the potential downside squeeze to the GameStop short squeeze ""but in reverse"", referring to the extraordinary 1,500% increase in the retailer's share price during two weeks in January.Now FFA traders are worried that hedging this exposure could create even more wild moves in the paper market.""The potential for extreme volatility in cape FFAs is there, as the volume of open option strikes sitting 15-30% below the current market could create hedging trade flow above and beyond the liquidity available in the futures market,"" one trader told TradeWinds.""A lot of fresh puts were traded over the past six weeks.""In the physical market on Tuesday, Baltic Exchange panellists assessed the 5TC average capesize spot rate $3,965 lower at $43,985 per day.ThresholdPhilippe van den Abeele, chief investment officer of Consortium Maritime Trading Ltd, sees a critical threshold approaching.Looking at the derivatives market from a technical point of view, the capesize spot market has maintained a resistance line of around $38,000 per day over the past 10 or 12 years, he explained.In other words: ""Every time we've reached that [level] over the past 10 years, capes tended to turn south with prices dropping quite consistently for the next three to four weeks.""An exception came in July, when the capesize 5TC assessment broke through the $38,000 level and kept on going until it reached the multi-year high of $86,870 per day on 6 October, van den Abeele noted.""I'm not saying I think it will happen, but I'm watching it like a hawk because I am convinced that if it breaks $38,000 [per day] convincingly on the downside then you will see a fresh bunch of sellers coming in to the FFA market,"" he added.""The possibility of bouncing higher from that level is equally feasible as we have reached a pivotal level in the recent cape freight pricing rollercoaster, as dry bulk prices tend to be mean-reverting over time.""AccelerationThere is a psychological element to this potential watershed too, van den Abeele said.""Just imagine, until three or four weeks ago the majority of the people out there held long cape positions for December delivery or at least til the end of November, believing that the Chinese congestion combined with exuberant Chinese steel production was going to last until then,"" he said.""When that crowd realises 'Oh, it's not going to happen', it's like you're going through a funnel — they all want to get to the exit but the door is very small for everyone to go through it.""Once the market decides to sell, everything tends to accelerate, he explained.""Shipowners start to panic in the physical market, the FFA market also panics, therefore the shipowners see the FFAs go down and it goes faster and faster,"" he went on.""That's why we have this massive drop — because the equilibrium at which you reach $86,000 per day is fragile, very fragile,"" he said, referring to the spot market's zenith.This acceleration effect was visible in the FFA market last week, according to Kerry Deal, head of business development at Freight Investor Services.""The fall in capes [last] week was admittedly steeper than some expected, with a storm of bad news driving sentiment lower on the paper, which included further issues at Evergrande, concerns on further Chinese steel production curbs, and Vale trimming down [fourth-quarter] production guidance against falling iron ore prices,"" Deal told TradeWinds"
"Why is everyone so hung up on the dividend? Yes, it's an LP, and profits are supposed to be distributed to partners, but is a 50 cent ($2 per year) dividend REALLY going to make that much difference in the share price, especially if it is not sustainable? The real driver of the SP is value. AF has created value and the SP will reflect that soon."
"@Msh - thanks for posting the link to the AF interview. Found it interesting. She appears to be a maturing in her understanding of business. I have long thought that a single segment business is only good for those that want to trade a stock up during boom times and then short it as the segment becomes out of favor. Investors seldom win that battle. NMM now has a chance to attract actual investors if and when AF can provide a sense of stability. Considering she has now publicly announced that as her strategy, well, we'll see."
Lowest volume I’ve seen in a long time. Nice that there aren’t many sellers but worrisome that it’s hard to find buyers
My take on NMM is that for the next 12-24 months the company will be making through the roof revenue. Tankers will come back to higher revenues over the next quarter or so as demand continues to grow as well. The only question I have and believe most do too is how much will AF increase the dividend and when?

"Chappell tells Navios private paradigm may be a public problemSeasoned analyst has told management why a diversified ownership model may not be popular with investorshe man regarded as ""the dean"" of US shipping analysts has strong views on Navios Maritime Partners’ attempts to move forward as an owner of diversified assets.Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI said Angeliki Frangou will not be hearing his advice for the first time in TradeWinds, as he has already conveyed it directly to Navios management.""I’ve told them I think the diversified strategy is exactly how you should run a shipping company,” Chappell said.It helps hedge you against downturns in some segments. It gives you longer-term sustainability. Some of the most successful companies in history have been diversified.""One might sense there is a ""but"" coming, and Chappell is quick to deliver it.""But I still don’t think it’s the right strategy for a public shipping company. Investors want to own a shipping company in the right time in the cycle,"" he said.""These are rental stocks. You want maximum leverage in that particular segment. You don’t want to be weighed down by exposure to another segment.""Chappell has been covering shipping stocks since 2001, at JP Morgan then, and was recently voted shipping’s top equity analyst in a survey by Institutional Investor magazine.He conceded there is not a lot of evidence for share performance of diversified owners since so few have strayed from the recommended ""pure play"" focus on one asset classHe mentioned the relatively diversified Tsakos Energy Navigation as a chronic underperformer in the tanker sector, and the “old” Overseas Shipholding Group as trailing more focused owners such as Frontline and even the former General Maritime in its time.""Investors want inflection points,"" Chappell said. ""They want the most earnings and dividend upside they can get in a hot market.""If you have a public bulker owner, with the market on fire, start buying tankers because that sector is in a cyclical low point, that just angers the shareholder base.""I have pretty high conviction on this and I told Navios as much.""Once its purchase of Navios Maritime Acquisition is made final, Navios Maritime Partners will become a 143-ship goliath with 55 bulkers, 43 containerships and 45 tankers"

"Five pennies ? That's it ? All this talk of a super cycle and all of the eatnings that will be generated and we get a nickle? Imagine what our share would be if we encountered reduced rates. Do you think, perhaps, AF will purchase for us her personally owned leasing compamy? I don't think so, that's a guaranteed money maker. We only get to purchase the basket cases. To those that will say NMCI wasn't a basket case, I say, it shouldn't have been created in the first place. NMM should have purchased those containers for our own portfolio instead of setting up a new entity with money borrowed from NMM. At that time AF was into empire building using seperate asset classes. Currently she's into diversification. She had her cheerleaders back then and she has a new set today. No matter what actions she pursues, her accolades cheer her on. It took me three and a half years to sell but better late than never. My new ride. SBLK, will be reporting"

"Going to wait and see what rates do next week. Any ideas on how container, tanker rates are forecast to look in the near term? I know a forecast isn't always accurate, but it's better than nothing."
ime now for a check on the Capesize nearby futures curve: A 25% contango in November with 5 trading days left ...quite a large discount based on history... Which direction will this gap close?
