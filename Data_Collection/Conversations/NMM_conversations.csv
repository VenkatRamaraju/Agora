"Investor Ned Sherwood tells Frangou it is time to talk: We're not big, bad guysFinance veteran rejects 'activist' tag, saying he just wants to help Navios Partners get its house in orderNed Sherwood wants people to know that he is not an ""activist investor"" — despite his public criticism of Greek shipowner Angeliki Frangou.He is not looking for a pile of money to walk away from his investment in her Navios Maritime Partners. Rather, the finance veteran of more than 40 years just wants something he said Frangou has been unwilling to give him: a chat.""I'm not an activist investor and I don't want a payoff,"" Sherwood told TradeWinds.""I'm basically a solid value investor. And just like a Warren Buffett or anyone else in that position, I'd like to be partners with Angeliki. If she wants to be partners with any of the [limited partners] in Navios. And right now it appears she doesn't.Sherwood, an investor based in Connecticut and Florida, spoke with TradeWinds after twice challenging Frangou in open letters to the Navios Partners board, accusing her of ""illogical"" actions ""counter to any sound business principles"".""I would hope Angeliki would agree to talk with me and I could be helpful to her,"" he said. ""In the meantime, I'm hoping that moral suasion will help lead her to doing some or all of what we're suggesting for her own good. It's not like we're some big, bad guys wanting something that's good for us and bad for her.""Frangou previously has told TradeWinds that she will not publicly comment on critiques made by an individual investor.But the company issued a new statement in response to Sherwood's latest broadside through New York-based spokeswoman Laura Yagerman, senior vice president for corporate communications.She said Navios Partners values its relationship with shareholders and is happy to ""engage in constructive dialogue"".""Although we are disappointed that Mr Sherwood chose to issue public press releases before engaging in any discussion with us, we have reached out to his organisation to coordinate a conversation about our plans to continue to build value for [him] and our other equity holders,"" Yagerman said."
"A “super squeeze” is underway in the Capesize market, and the reason is not what you think – The Capesize markethas entered a phase of heightened volatility as positional imbalances are reaching extreme levels and owners withvessels located in the appropriate loading windows will enjoy some of the most profitable days ever. This is not afundamental imbalance and should not be taken for granted. The current tightness reflects the significantdislocation of commodities (see coal below) across the logistical chain which, combined with weather disruptionsand ongoing port congestion, is causing a perfect storm scenario for the ones who hold the most valuable asset,namely a ship. Where we go from here is anyone’s guess: There are no real metrics to consider, as prices are only“subject to availability” and not market balance. The expectation of a market correction is by no means a prediction,rather a natural reaction to the exponential move already underway. However, “how high is high” is a more topicaldiscussion, and the historical charts point to much higher levels(all-time highsfor Capesize spot rates lie somewherein the mid-$200,000/day). Futures remain in steep backwardation, as expected, and the discounts make it extremelyhard to position for a potential correction. Rather, everyday that spot moves higher, futures follow, creating a selffeeding cycle (with short positions covering). With the risk of an outdated prediction as soon as the market openstomorrow, we believe the probability of lower spot levels in the next few weeks exceeds the risk of holding longpositions, but again, this is more of a “gut feeling” rather than a calculated forecast as there are significant factorsimpossible to model. Thus, humbleness should be the only real strategy in the current state of dry bulk"
"Spent hours listening to the CEO's on the New York Maritime Forum. All the CEO's in containers say the good times are going to last for quite some time. The CEO's in dry bulk said basically the same thing. The CEO's in tankers say the market is starting to turn now and will get hot quickly, not months, weeks. Everybody agrees they don't want new builds and the order book is low and will stay that way . Many CEO's said we need rates to stabilize and even pull back somewhat to prevent inflation which is what could kill the consumer and demand. Every CEO in every sector said their customers are wanting long term contracts, 3-5 years which is great for stability. Some said they have been holding back on the dividend in order to firm up their balance sheets and that unit holders and shareholders have been patient and now it's time to start taking care of them. Let's hope our CEO feels that way. So if you are short you are going to have a long road ahead of you. I hope to listen to NMM interview tomorrow when playback is available. Unless they are all wrong we are in for a pretty good period ahead."
My take on NMM is that for the next 12-24 months the company will be making through the roof revenue. Tankers will come back to higher revenues over the next quarter or so as demand continues to grow as well. The only question I have and believe most do too is how much will AF increase the dividend and when?

"In a few weeks we should hear an announcement regarding distributions. These fluctuations that we experience daily used to upset me. I suppose if I was a traitor instead of an investor I would be excited with the fluctuations.I do believe that NMM is a rocketship ready to blast off. It just needs the catalyst for the spark and in financial terms, some investors with big clout to take the helm.Good luck everyoneI’m in observation mode"
"J. Hannisdahl: ""The biggest uncertainty...#drybulk is extremely high, I think earnings will collapse into Q1. I think you can see capesize earning below $10,000/day. And now we are around 60-70. If that plays out, it will surprise a lot of people."""

"So, you wake up to a market one day that decides the shipping snarl will unwind one day with box container rates dropping and supply chains shruggingly adapting. And because of that you note the market has been been selling Hapag-Lloyd, Costco, and Evergreen container shipping companies for the past month or so and you say to yourself, “Perhaps I should sell that NMM container ship company too.”But wait, that means I sell their dry bulk shipping too.And, and, and come Friday their tankers as well?Hmmmm….."

"Sept. 28th the Capesize daily rate was under $70,000 per day and NMM was trading @ $32.80. Today still over $70,000 per day rate and it’s at ￼￼$28 because of the drop? That’s a drop of over $100m Market Cap. FYI, The Capesize daily rate was trading at less than $40,000 per day with NMM having a higher market cap than this. What’s else is off, the containerships are just starting to get into their higher rates with an additional 7 more ships rates to be reset over the next few months. Both of these 2 cylinders are firing at levels not seen in a long time and one of them (containerships) is set to fire at this level for at least 2 -3 years. When NNA comes on board, they are atleast currently making a profit at these depressed rate. If those rates go up, this would be a massive increase in revenue and profit. FYI, the dividends￼ will come, I’ve made a ton on AF’s dividends in the past, She’s being very cautious this time around. She made promises before about dividends and when the rates dropped and they were on spot rates, she had to do a 180. That’s when investors started to not trust her. Not trying to take her side here. She had to do what she had to do to survive. That’s why she’s being very cautious this time. She wants to lock in those rates first. That’s what she said her goal was with the dry bulk vessels on her last conference call. This is one of the best opportunities I’ve seen in a long time and I know she will pay a decent dividend when the time is right. That’s not a guess, that’s based on my passed history with NMM."

"Just going back over the August presentation AF made. She represented 2022 revenues would be $1..5 billion based on the then average charter rates (includes NNA after merger).; $20 million in debt repayment. Unclear what ebitda will be going forward, however, I would think it would be at least half of revenue next year. Back of the napkin noodling makes ebitda per unit next year look to be something north of $22. Said differently, next year NMM will produce net cash equal to 75% of the current unit price. Once AF begins cranking up the dividend, the unit price will move up fast too. While some of the analysis that I’ve seen with unit prices at or above $300 seem astronomical and I don’t know if that would ever happen, it does seem that NNM is undervalued and not by a little bit."

"Dry bulk shipowners are not rushing to the yards to order new tonnage, despite enjoying a booming sector in which spot rates have doubled in the past month.They are instead looking to secondhand ships for asset play to remain nimble in the sales-and-purchase market while waiting for pending environmental regulations to take hold.""If you buy a secondhand ship — maybe you made a booboo maybe you feel uncomfortable with it — you go into the secondhand market and you get rid of it,"" Goodbulk chief executive John Michael Radziwill said.""With the newbuilding, you're like a deer in front of headlights.""Secondhand ships allow owners to fix a secondhand vessel at $40,000 per day right now instead of waiting two years to get maybe $15,000 per day on a newbuilding order, he said.""You have tons of optionality,"" he said on Tuesday as a panellist for a talk on dry bulk shipping at Capital Link's 13th annual New York Maritime Forum.The three-day conference is being held online to Thursday afternoon for Covid-19 safety.""I see no reason to oversupply our market,"" he said.""The reason why we're in this place is because we had restrained on newbuilding orders, so don't go out and make the same mistake now.""Spot rates for capesize bulkers have reached highs unseen since 2008 amid a perfect storm of low supply, high demand and supply-chain disruption.The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average weighted across five key routes, fell 3.9% to $79,535 on Tuesday, according to Baltic Exchange data.That is still almost double what it was a month ago at $40,518 per day on 8 September.New regulations on the wayOwners should hold off on ordering new tonnage since regulations will probably require zero-emission ships by 2050, said Gary Vogel, chief executive of Eagle Bulk Shipping.""I think every newbuilding decision is a decarbonisation opportunity,"" he said.""Waiting and understanding what's available in terms of zero-emission ships in just a couple of years I think is a huge opportunity, and I think we all should focus on that opportunity.""In the meantime, owners should minimise carbon emissions from secondhand ships through slow steaming and other measures, said Martyn Wade, chief executive of Grindrod Shipping.""It doesn't make any sense at the moment to speed up,"" he said.""Demand is there, and we are satisfying the demand in the best way we can.""Seanergy Maritime Holdings, a pureplay capesize owner, has invested $160m this year on six secondhand ships while selling one ship to expand its fleet to 16 capesizes.Chief executive Stamatis Tsantanis said his company is waiting to see new advancements in carbon reduction before it starts committing to newbuilding orders.""Once we have clarity on what's going to be the technology of tomorrow and what's going to be the prevailing ship — the model of which we still don't feel comfortable as a company —then we can consider on the basis of financial returns if that makes sense or not,"" he said"

"Dry Bulk Market: Capesize Market Rally Continues Unabatedin Dry Bulk Market, International Shipping News 11/10/2021CapesizeThe Capesize market continued its bull rally this week as we move into the tail-end quarter of the year. The Capesize 5TC managed a high of $86,953 on Thursday before closing out the week on a softer note at $83,865. Throughout the earlier part of the week the Pacific basin rose in tandem with the Atlantic on strong sentiment. But was seen to soften as the week ended leaving the Atlantic paying a significant premium. The Transatlantic C8 closed at $95,550 to the Transpacific C10 at $77,692. The Backhaul C16 lifted a shocking +16,175 over the week to close at $62,650. In this prime earning period owners are reluctant to lock in precious time performing positioning cargoes. The opportunity cost of forgoing higher paying fixtures is forcing charterers to make substantial lifts to their bids. The Fronthaul C9, on the higher end of the value spectrum, is reaching well into the six digit levels now as the route closes the week at $118,950. The Capesize market remains well supported and very active. While the market softened slightly towards the end of the week, there appears little sign that the fireworks are coming to an end."

IMHO I think AF will hold NM as the parent an NMM as the L.P.. She will not list Logistics (NSAL) but keep it in NM. Because the shipping market has changed so much this year it just does not make financial sense to include NM at this time into NMM IMHO. Especially because of the tax issue not to mention her benefit on the loan interest. AJMHO.

"A little perspective. Three months ago to date, while approaching Q 2's numbers being released the share price was $17 plus. Currently we're awaiting Q 3's release and we're at $27 plus. Sure, we've traded down from a short time high of $36, but we're not alone in this short term reversal. A three month chart shows all of the bulkers sliding into the #$%$ It is more likely than not that as we get closer to Q 3's numbers being released the share prices will rise in anticipation of a the fantastic quarter just completed and the likely better quarter that we're currently in. The powers are shaking the tree so hold on tight and enjoy your favorite beverage because better days are approaching. Run a three month graph that includes 8 or 10 of your favorite bulkers and you'll instantly see that this slide is not company specific."

"@Msh - thanks for posting the link to the AF interview. Found it interesting. She appears to be a maturing in her understanding of business. I have long thought that a single segment business is only good for those that want to trade a stock up during boom times and then short it as the segment becomes out of favor. Investors seldom win that battle. NMM now has a chance to attract actual investors if and when AF can provide a sense of stability.

"Ship Owner Says Commodity Freight Rates Close to Going ParabolicBy Alex Longley(Bloomberg) -- An owner of commodity hauling freighters said rates for the ships are close to the point of spiking sharply higher and mirroring an unprecedented surge in costs for transporting manufactured goods.Spot rates for container ships to move manufactured products have surged for 20 straight weeks and now stand 731% above their seasonal average over the prior five years, according to Drewry Shipping. John Wobensmith, the president and chief executive officer of Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd., said that prices to move commodities -- which have already rallied sharply -- may follow.“You do get to a point, and you’ve seen this in containers, where you hit a certain utilization rate and you start to go parabolic on rates,” he said in an interview. “I think we’re getting close to that period.” Container rates have climbed because of snarled supply chains and extra trade that have strained the fleet’s capacity as economies emerge from the worst of Covid-19. The boom reached into every corner of the global economy because merchant fleet handles about 80% of the world’s traded goods.With more than 5 billion tons of dry commodities moved each year in so-called bulkers -- things like iron ore, coal, grains, steel and lumber -- a surge in dry freight would affect industries that produce and process everything from raw materials and crops. Rates for giant Capesize carriers had their biggest single-day surge since 2008 on Monday, reaching $52,908 a day. Wobensmith said demand is currently outpacing vessel supply, which will remain low for years with shipyard orders mostly led by container ships. Earnings remain well below the 2008 peak -- in excess of $200,000 a day just before the global recession hit -- and Wobensmith doesn’t anticipate them to get that high this time around. He also expects the situation to calm down again early next year."

Now that NMM has significant exposure to tankers they should be given more credit for that on days like today when tanker pure plays are soaring. NMM isn't even up as much as most bulkers today or even some containers for that matter. I feel that this company is very poorly understood. This is a screaming value. I can't wait for earnings. Maybe then people will begin to understand.

"The writing is on the wall and it looks like shipping is unfortunately going back to the dog house. Too bad our SP didn't better align with the ""historic"" BDI rise. I feel like a huge opportunity was missed, but it seems many investors avoided shipping because of volatility and poor management. A lot of us here had expectations that we'd at least hit $40, but shipping continues to disappoint."
"The reason for low volume and dropping prices is that investors are reluctant to sell their shares without further evidence of earnings and distributions to the shareholders or unit holders.We could see a quick reversal in the current trend coming up. Risk takers are capitalizing on the uncertainty, as they always do to grab as many shares at this time. They may believe that this is their only opportunity, because after the dividend/Distribution investors will be reluctant to part with their shares for quite a while."
"Missing Brian's early BDI rate posts prior to general availability so I looked it up myself. The Baltic Exchange’s dry bulk sea freight index slipped to a two-week low on Wednesday as a decline in the larger capesize segment outweighed higher panamax and supramax vessel rates.The overall index, which factors in rates for capesize, panamax, supramax and handysize vessels, fell by 172 points, or 3.2%, to 5,206.The capesize index fell 602 points, or 6.3%, to 8,988, its lowest since Sept. 30.Average daily earnings for capesizes, which transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, fell $4,995 to $74,540."

"Booming spot rates for capesize bulkers may prompt charterers to start using panamaxes as a cheaper alternative to carry commodities, according to brokers.The capesize 5TC, a spot-rate average weighted across five key routes, on Thursday came in at $74,176 per day after losing $610 per day, according to Baltic Exchange data.The panamax 5TC, by comparison, reached $36,119 per day after shedding $216 per day.Instances of charterers hiring two panamaxes instead of one capesize are ""still limited"" despite the rate disparity, according to Derek Langston, head of research at UK-based brokerage house Simpson Spence Young.""In addition, the Atlantic basin feels over-tonnaged in the panamax sector, so limiting the upside in the immediate term,"" he told TradeWinds.""The Pacific provides the main upside potential for panamaxes, however, with stem splitting starting to appear at the end of September.""Chiba Shipping has fixed the 84,790-dwt MG Kronos (built 2016) to Cobelfret at $40,000 per day for a 2 October voyage from China to South Korea via New Zealand with the intention to carry coal.Brokers said they are not aware of capesize stems being split into panamaxes yet, but the idea is getting thrown around in the market."

Goldman Sachs commodity research very firm on oil shortage. Price will rise until one of two things occur:1. Demand destruction2. Increase supplyTheir risk to price is to the upside with an $85 target.What’s happening in the UK and Europe is a glimpse to what will come to the entire commodity sector. US may be hesitant to increase oil supply due to cost and discipline.Supply chain constraints in all extraction industries leaves them vulnerable to periodic shocks (alternative energy hiccup) like we’re seeing now.Their working theme is “the revenge of the old economy.”

It gives you longer-term sustainability. Some of the most successful companies in history have been diversified.""One might sense there is a ""but"" coming, and Chappell is quick to deliver it.""But I still don’t think it’s the right strategy for a public shipping company. Investors want to own a shipping company in the right time in the cycle,"" he said.""These are rental stocks. You want maximum leverage in that particular segment. You don’t want to be weighed down by exposure to another segment.""Chappell has been covering shipping stocks since 2001, at JP Morgan then, and was recently voted shipping’s top equity analyst in a survey by Institutional Investor magazine.He conceded there is not a lot of evidence for share performance of diversified owners since so few have strayed from the recommended ""pure play"" focus on one asset classHe mentioned the relatively diversified Tsakos Energy Navigation as a chronic underperformer in the tanker sector, and the “old” Overseas Shipholding Group as trailing more focused owners such as Frontline and even the former General Maritime in its time.""Investors want inflection points,"" Chappell said. ""They want the most earnings and dividend upside they can get in a hot market.""If you have a public bulker owner, with the market on fire, start buying tankers because that sector is in a cyclical low point, that just angers the shareholder base.""I have pretty high conviction on this and I told Navios as much.""Once its purchase of Navios Maritime Acquisition is made final, Navios Maritime Partners will become a 143-ship goliath with 55 bulkers, 43 containerships and 45 tankers"

"Just noodling around a bit with the latest charter rates and how that might shape up next year. Assuming rates hold and AF is able to capture those as contracts come up for renewal, the revenue and cash flow next year will be astounding! Free cash flow could easily be higher than the current unit price. This just seems to be so upside down that I am questioning my own numbers. Has anyone else run this and have a projection for next year?"
"Short of some new black swan event, I don’t see rates coming down significantly until maybe 3Q 2022. By then I would think AF would have dry bulk and containers signed with relatively high rate long-term contracts. Tankers will begin improving this quarter I would think. Unclear how much improvement there will be over the next few quarters. However, NNA was profitable in 2Q and one would have to think that part of the business will only improve in 2022. Also considering AF has already projected $1.5 billion next year revenue, it makes me wonder why NMM is struggling to advance. The only negative that I can see is the absence of any clarity around dividends.For all intents and purposes NNA is already a sub of NNM creating a NAV in excess of $4 billion or said differently the per unit value north of $100. So at a current unit price of $30, what’s wrong with this picture?"

As an nmm unit holder I’d be much happier without the current bailout and the probably one of nm coming up. She wouldn’t have done the two ATM’s so we’d be sitting at about 20 million shares with a nice dividend and a share price probably well over 40. And making great money. I’d take that any day over the gamble she is taking by acquiring these companies strictly so they can avoid bankruptcy. Maybe they work out in the long term but that is a gamble not worth taking.

I have an attempt at running numbers - feel free to add your input and comment....2013-2015 were excellent for distributions but it just drops of a cliff....gives some insight to as why AF may be more cautious currently.

Totally different company now also - revenue alone in 2022 could eclipse that of 2013 - 2017 (tankers incl.) naturally this will lean to a more stable div policy - but as AF says it should be able to reduce the cyclical nature of it.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ab1Bo-xIfgBYR5LYRPTPA5xOrGzMPCYypMSQbX5uBgM/edit#gid=0

"I would encourage everyone to listen to the analysts forum, the last forum on the third day. 6 shipping analysts all very optimistic with good reasons to back it up, NMM was actually mentioned. I listened to AF, she said by being diversified and getting leverage down in the 20% area NMM would become a much more stable company and when one sector was in the dumps they would be able to take full advantage of cheap assets, where pure plays cannot. I found it interesting that the analysts said such a structure with low leverage and mentioned 20% would in the long run, their words, eat the lunch of the pure plays. They all agreed that investors and hedge funds at this time don't like that because they want a short term play and want to try and time the market, but mutual funds where the big money is will start catching on. So once we get our leverage where AF wants it we can have a stable company with a stable dividend and a stock price that reflects that. So if you want boom and bust with an unstable dividend take your money out of here and find a pure play and hope you time it right so you don't give it all back. Call me crazy but I now think AF knows what she is doing, and I can wait another couple of quarters for a more stable company with a fair stable dividend and a good share price and a company that can get through all cycles."

"Can not figure this one out. So far in the first two quarters they have earned $5.43 and are expected to earn another $3+ in the just ended third quarter. That is a bit over $8.50 per share for three quarters, that is less than a 4 PE. What is wrong with this pitcher? The stock should be three times today's pps IMHO."

While container ships sit off port waiting to be unloaded goods are stacking up waiting to be shipped creating a backlog which will extend this rally even further. While these container ships sit and wait to be unloaded they are paid big money and they are burning no fuel that means even higher profits.

"finally the rate/value gap is closing... means people are buying into the sustained ratesThe incredible rally of the dry bulk market during the month of August has started to translate to higher prices in the second hand market for dry bulk carriers as well. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Intermodal said that “August was extremely hot in the dry bulk market with rates rising at levels that we have years to witness. The dry bulk index exceeded the 4,000 points mark on the 20th of August, a trend which followed an upward trajectory until the 27th of August when it reached 4,235 points. We are reminding you that the last time the dry bulk index exceeded the 4,000 points mark was back in May 2010 when the BDI reached 4209 points”.According to Intermodal’s SnP Broker, Mr. George Iliopoulos, “such an increase in the dry bulk freight market could not but affect the secondhand prices of bulker units which saw their values improve sharply within a short period of time, a trend which seems that has not yet stabilized; we see last done level of asset values being higher from their previous one. As a result of the sharp freight market improvement and the significant surge in buying interest, secondhand values have doubled since the beginning of the year."
"Added additional rates:Baltic Dry Index rises 4.4% to 5,647Capesize +7.41% to $86,870Panamax -0.38% to $33,794Supramax 58k tons +0.18% to $37,269"
"Now that all 3 segments are combined, we have $4,220B in vessel value and $1,472B in debt. The net asset value is around $2,748B. Roughly $88.64 per unit value. Not including cash and $1.6B in long term contracts. The units are trading around .31% of NAV."
This just has the feel of being held down leading up to reporting next month.First week in November should provide a big lift to pps.
Any thoughts as to why NMM price is stagnant for 6 months vs BDRY?

"Interesting ffa move. Curious how shopping moved down too especially given the BDI is up. Hellenic shipping news had an article over the weekend which indicated a big move from Australian iron ore to Brazil. That would seem to more than balance any reduction in steel production in China given Brazil provides for shipping miles/revenue.Between the box ships and dry bulk, NMM should continue reporting strong revenue over the next several quarters. The biggest wild card in this story isn’t even the NNA merger, it’s AF. When is she going to give partners any of the free cash flow versus buying up her other bankrupt companies."
Good amount of options expire today. Should rally next week.
"BDI is at 13 year highs. Harpex is at all time highs. Tankers are currently making a small profit (NNA), but expected to begin performing more normally in 2022. Nigeria oil refinery coming on line in 2022-2023 will increase demand for tankers going forward. Seems to me that NMM will be posting very good numbers in 3Q/4Q. Will AF remember the partners though?"
Anyone know if AF will speak at the Capital Link forum this week?
What’s the difference between NMM and NM stock?
"With BDI 5200, with estimated annual earnings that are 50% of share price, unheard of in the securities markets, and with only a few weeks left before an announcement regarding dividends and earnings why wouldn’t a thief want to steal your shares?"
One way for security or the stock market for that matter to stay still is just to bounce back-and-forth. I believe that’s where we are until distributions are announced in the earnings are announced.
"next week's conference should be a great time. All the CEOs set to speak, time for gloating. Coming out of a 12 year bear market in shipping is very profitable."
To soon for a New Years day prediction?
imo these insanely high rates are making the NM acquisition less likely at this time... NM will be generating great ebitda and she should be able to restructure the debt....
Wondering when the news about the supply chain will get more investors looking at the shipping industry? More people in my day to day life are starting to talk about it. Perhaps the next earnings report will drive more money into the industry as a whole and NMM specifically.

Just a few more weeks and we will know what the distribution will be. I think the minimum will be $.50 and the maximum will be a dollar

"Hi all, I'm just a novice when it comes to trading but trying to get better educated!I did quite well with early pot stocks and got out well before the bottom fell out and turned that profit towards NMM at around $7 a share (11k shares), anyway, I still think the stock has much more upside from what I have read and researched but I'm no guru. would like to hear other thoughts from investors that actually own NMM.Thank you for your timeStephen"

"Gotta feel good about future tanker rates:Gas Shortage Prompts Power Plants to Switch to Oil, Boosting DemandIEA expects energy crunch to lift oil demand above pre-pandemic levels next year The world’s thirst for oil is likely to exceed pre-pandemic levels next year, the IEA said.Soaring natural-gas and coal prices are pressuring power-generation companies and manufacturers to switch to using oil, a trend that could add half a million barrels a day to global demand, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.In its monthly market report, the IEA increased its global oil-demand forecasts for this year and the next by 170,000 and 210,000 barrels a day, respectively, but added that the cumulative effect of the energy crisis could be as large as 500,000 barrels a day from September through next year’s first quarter.That increase means that the IEA, which acts as the energy watchdog for the wealthy nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expects the world’s thirst for crude next year to exceed pre-pandemic levels at 99.6 million barrels a day.And further in the article:Analysts say the IEA’s forecast of an extra 500,000 barrels a day in demand from the energy crisis may be conservative.“We have never had a situation like this where oil is extremely cheap [versus gas] so we just don’t have empirical evidence” for how much oil demand may increase, said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets. “It could very well be more than a million barrels,” he added.WSJ Journal (10/14/2021)"
