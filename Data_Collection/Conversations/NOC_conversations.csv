Anyone adding at $363?
Take it down $50 like LMT so I can buy more lol
"The only defense stock in my portfolio, with a reason."
"Seeking Alpha ""Of Course, I'm Buying Northrop!"" Aug. 22, 2021 5:52 PM ET - Northrop Grumman is a low-growth defense contractor with the ability to generate tremendous shareholder wealth.- The company has a high free cash flow yield, a low debt load, and advanced products that will guarantee a strong future order flow.- It's the kind of sleep well at night stock long-term investors should own as the risk/reward is fantastic.No-brainers don't exist, but NOC comes very close. As a long-term dividend growth investor, NOC gives me everything I want. The company is anti-cyclical, has fantastic products that will allow it to benefit from the United State's need to maintain a high defense budget, generates a lot of free cash flow, and uses this to reward its investors."
"Another day, another all-time high ($381.64)?"
Back to $345 soon! Sippy’s fake economy
Supply chain worries will haunt defense stocks for a while.
NOC is definitely doing better than LMT. Hope they increase dividend at least as much as LMT pays
"259,117 share were just bought on level 2 at over $357...it is starting."
So happy I didn’t sell any shares of NOC when the stock was stuck in the trading range.
I added more before close yesterday. I can’t see this taking down long.
This is what happens when CEO's focus on carbon credits vs running the business. Kathy should step down.
Maybe they will take it down to $345 so we can add more
Why is it down so much premarket?
"Really? Supply chain issues, but really? Bought stock."
Do your own research. Don’t believe these so called experts. They are here to misguide people for their own gains
Expected decline in the defense business. Overall results are still much better than $LMT.
This will follow suit after ER. Brace for impact.
Another all-time high going into the weekend 
Looks like they will be taken down more this morning!
This is going to be funny when it snaps back and all the shorts are literally holding their shorts. Shorts will be dirty from the doodoo in pants.
I will add few at 348. Hope it gets there
I am buying before ER tomorrow morning .
"I've owned NOC since Kresa built it and since as Sugar integrated it, Bush turned into a top performer and Warden positioned it for the next 20 years. While I'm always interested in earnings releases, I can't get excited about the short-term volatility they bring. NOC has clearly outperformed its closest peer (LMT - which I also own) and should continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Anyway, good luck to all tomorrow regardless if you choose to trade NOC or are a buy and hold investor."
@Ellie you were correct. NOC is making the share holders smile.
"Appears NOC is forming a bottom. For some perspective, NOC last traded at $355 six weeks ago on September 24. Also, at $355 NOC is +20% YTD, so it appears this weeks action is a reaction (not necessarily an over-reaction) to NOC's results and those of its industry peers. NOC's recent retrenchment seems to be a stage in NOC's upward pattern which should continue as long #$%$P 500 doesn't collapse as NOC's portfolio and backlog are strong and the world isn't getting any safer."
"What happened to that bitter ex-employee Rango who this year posted ""Kathy, please step down.... do us all a favour. Oh, and yes... 250 is around the corner."" and ""I'm afraid you are right. I projected 250 but who knows just how far she's going to drive the company into the gutters."" and ""Looken' good Kathy.... With your lack of help to shore up the NG stock... 250 is just around the corner."" and ""The complaints against Kathy are well warranted! Do your homework. I'm sure she'll make someone a nice pool secretary... in some other company."""
NOC didn’t do as well as expected by some experts here. Sad!

"Yup... NG stk was at 350 in early 2018.... Now we are nearing the end of 2021 and our stk is at... wait for it... 350. Good job Kathy for keeping the stk price for three years ..and still running. Hey you you think the stock will be be 350 in another 3 years??? Projection.... NG has firm price on NG stk for 6 years solid. Hey you bought at 350 in April 2018 .... and you'll be able to sell in 2022 with possibly no loss in your investment.. WOW, that sounds like a plan! Oh wait... here's a thought... the same return by just putting it away your mattress."
12/17 NG was at 240... this is probably the new base line.... Yup... Oh ya' whats my favorite saying .... 'Great job shoring up the stock Kathy!'
Hey Kathy... Lookin' good... what do-ya think the next hard stop will be... 300??
Military industrial complex not doing so well.
"….. well, we’ve had our 15% haircut. Buyback now."
Called this one folks.
Please be careful about these so called experts on this platform. They be selling when asking you to buy and vice versa.
"management asked employees to switch their day off in order to charge as many hours as possible to this quarter. now I understand why, lol "
NOC is not LMT. I expect positive report tomorrow. How market will react is different question.

"NOC in the news, for yet ANOTHER mass pollution event. This is a massive polluter sitting on lots of liability that is seeping out just like the toxins they leave around their plants. See the York v. Northrop Grumman class action filed on 9/29/21 in US District Crt. of Western District of Missouri - Southern Division."
