"OK, any wizards of Wall Street here tonight. Are we going back up tomorrow? The pattern for the last month or two says yes. I just been sitting and holding hoping this will continue to be a good growth stock for another year or two. Any comments?"
39cent dividend declared...nothing spectacular
"Berenberg analyst Sebastian Bray is openly bullish on Albemarle’s prospects, writing of the company: “We expect demand for lithium, the key material used in electric vehicle batteries, to grow strongly during this decade, and pricing to remain firm. We forecast long-term contract prices for Albemarle of USD16,000 per ton, significantly ahead of Albemarle’s 2020 Aaverage contract prices of USD13,000... We expect Albemarle’s earnings to grow strongly on the back of lithium capacity additions. We estimate Albemarle’s production will increase five-fold by 2030E, quickly contracting current valuation multiples."""
good solid day
"Lithium almost $25,000 per ton (both types). This is over 3 times last year's pricing!"
"Looks like CMP is getting in the Lithium business. Opinions appreciated.OVERLAND PARK, Kan., October 19, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Compass Minerals (NYSE: CMP), a leading global provider of essential minerals, today announced the successful, third-party conversion testing of its lithium brine resource into both lithium carbonate and battery-grade lithium hydroxide, representing a significant milestone in its previously announced lithium development project.The company engaged Veolia Energy, an established technology provider, to conduct lithium chloride to lithium hydroxide conversion testing utilizing a proven, commercially viable conversion process. The company believes this is the first known conversion to battery-grade lithium hydroxide from the sustainable lithium brine resource originating from the Great Salt Lake.At a concentration of >56.5% lithium hydroxide monohydrate, the conversion sample meets established battery-grade specifications for the U.S. domestic electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage markets. Compass Minerals believes this achievement, and the resulting supply it is expected to help enable, is critical for U.S. domestic production of advanced battery materials and support of a growing domestic EV fleet. As previously disclosed, the company expects to enter the market with a battery-grade lithium hydroxide product by 2025.""When we first announced the identification of a readily available, 2.4 million ton lithium brine resource, we emphasized that we are evaluating multiple paths forward for development, potential partnerships, and product selection to ensure optimal shareholder value. While that work continues, our progress to date puts us firmly on track for market entry with a battery-grade lithium product by 2025,"" said Kevin S. Crutchfield, president and CEO. ""As we continue to assess potential DLE technology partners and commercial opportunities, we remain committed to responsible stewardship of this exciting and sustainable resource. We look forward to providing future updates as we achieve additional milestones in the coming months."""
"OK, what happened around 11 this morning?? All three of my lithium stocks took a nose dive. Some announce the EV is a hoax. There is no need for lithium? These price swings are so frequent and make no sense except to cause quick short term capital gains then buy them back after the price has been lowered. All my cash is invested in the market or else I would be buying on these down swings. My only “bad” investment has been T. But its dividend is very good and it will bounce back."
It may be off the highs but at least it’s not off the rails. Take a look at QS for the year and you realize the value of steady hands at the tiller. I’ll be back in hard once this current froth ends. Yes I’ll miss the first up but this is a long game.
Spot lithium prices have started to rise again after the Chinese holidays. Looking for even more action after recovery from the floods in China affecting manufacturing. I’m thinking the next two quarters for ALB will be complete blowouts. Profitability should be up from the next round of lithium contracts and oil production picking up catalysts.
Guess the market not happy with ALB buying into China. Not the most stable place financially. Could the 200M be better used elsewhere?
"One of the listed company tickers below makes far more profit than all the other companies combined, derives fully one fourth of its revenue from lithium (amounting to one fifth of the world's lithium market), and gets another third of its revenue from specialty fertilizers (a market which has been on fire just like lithium). Furthermore, this company has zero net debt and is growing its already big profits year over year at a 65% clip. And yet its stock still trades at a 17 forward P/E and has gone completely unnoticed by Wall Street and the retail investor lithium mania. Which ticker is it?$SQM $ALB $LAC $LTHM $PLL $OROCF $PILBF $ENR $QS $SLI $APHLF $MLNLF $SGML $WMLLF $ABEPF $PNXLF $ENS $BCLMF $ABML $FCEL $PLUG $BLDP $GEVO $CLNE $LIACF $MVST $FREY $VULNF $VARGF $NTTHF $LIT"
"Spot lithium up again. 182,500 Yuan/T"
Website shows over 300 open jobs with many added this week. Still a great indicator of expansion.
"Anybody have any idea what this Huntsman-Rockwood dispute that recently came to an arbitration decision is all about? I see a press release from Alb talking about how they disagree with the ruling, but can't find any details about the ruling itself or what it concerns - beyond the facts that it predates the Alb acquisition of Rockwood."
"With a mkt cap of 26B ALB is not too big to be acquisition target, especially if buyer wants to go all-in on LI and sell off bromine and catalysts. Being quite profitable they would get a good price. Mkt caps of some other large miners - Glencore 65B, BHP 143B, Rio Tito104B."
"Does ALB trades any where else than USA (e.g. China, Europe, any other). Thx."
Hour after the bell now. The DOW is up. My whole portfolio is green and then there is my three lithium stocks. Bleeding red. This makes no sense to me. What? The demand for lithium is gone? No one wants EV now? This pattern of share price movement has been occurring for almost a year now. What really is happening? What is the truth?
I'm thinking about starting a nice position in ALB. After doing my DD they seem to check all of the boxes.My only concern is the up and coming Solid State Battery technologies. ex. QS and Solid Power (going public shorty)Is this non lithium option going to be big competition for today's lithium solutions? It still looks like its a few years away. Perhaps buy and hold until the car manufactures adopt solid state? Any insights and thoughts will be appreciated. GLTA
Looks like we’re in floaty floaty mode until earnings.
QS got beaten up by a Panasonic battery announcement.
