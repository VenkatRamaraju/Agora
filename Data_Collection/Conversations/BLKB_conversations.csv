"They paid a ransom and did not tell any of their thousand compromised clients, many non profits and education schools for over 2 months! And never even mentioned in their last earnings call when they knew. Oh but the invaders said they all the info was destroyed and that is good enough for BB...really? How safe do you feel and why havenâ€™t they been in the press for this??"
