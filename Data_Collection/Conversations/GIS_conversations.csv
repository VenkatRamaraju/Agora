"Nice momentum building here, it's about time...."
Earnings at 4$ a share share count going down debt going down growing business plus .51 dividend what is not to like? Next qtr will be better. We will see 4.50 over the next year in earnings. Lower debt = more in earnings plus share buy backs are an added bonus. Huge gift here
Looking for some good long term dividend stocks. Any input?

What a beautiful day!
NYSE: GIS) today announced its inaugural sustainability-linked bond aligned to the company’s efforts to combat climate change.Woke. SELL.
"boy, can't get enough general mills stock"
Earnings were fantastic but missed adjusted eps by 2 cents. Even though eps was up double digits from last year seems mr mkt is not happy.I say its a buying opportunity:-)
"Market doesn't give these food companies much love as far as higher stock prices. I liked khc investor day, thought CPB earnings were ok and now GIS. Can't seem to get the multiple of a PG. Seems to me this pandemic is a good opportunity for these food staples to advertise, market, and try to keep there new business from restaurant's. It will be interesting to see if they can keep the business and it expand on it. Many restaurants are closing. See if these companies can take advantage of this on a longer term."
next stop 55

Buy order for 400 shares in at 55
I bought some today at $57.57
Chipotle CMG up 177 dollars today Market cap 45 billion yesterday almost 50 billion today when is the last time GIS was up just a 1.77? earnings for CMG 200 million in the most recent quarter half the earnings of GIS but 15 billion more in market cap.. GIS needs to forget about dog food and open a couple drive thru restaurants. oh and Robinhood going public at 35 billion dollars same market cap as GIS they lost 500 million last year.. I just don't get the valuations
"We all know this is a quality company. Folks gotta eat, General Mills has been producing for decades. It's a long term savings account. I like it when pulls back some. Only lost 25% value in 2007 recession. Stay long and feel safe."
"You can buy muni bond funds that yield the same (or more, in some cases near 5%) as this, and the dividends are fed tax free. Live in a tax free state, its all free money. Why is this so ""safe"", because people gotta eat? They have to pay taxes/fees too that support muni bonds."
I heard about GIS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Over 60 today. Will it hold? Ehhhh.
Nice upgrade at Citi to buy with a 70$ price target. This is a well run company that has focused on returning to investors for more than 100 years. Have I ever mentioned on here that folks gotta eat? Thus is as safe of a investment you will ever make.
whats unfortunate are the companies that go no where like GIS get hammered when the market goes up 500 points and when the market goes down 250 GIS drops along with it but stocks like microsoft and apple both trillion dollar companies drop only a few cents with any market pull back after going up 5 times over last few years GIS down another 3 per cent today in a market where bitcoin goes up 2 grand a day and other high flyers no earnings stock double in a weeks time why would anyone invest in staple stocks or oil stocks or bio techs or drug companies that take years to bring a product to market with much cost why not invest in a company that produces nothing but has a platform to connect people
"Over 60 this week? Ehhh maybe? Don’t care, just sitting on it for the next decade or 2."
Ex divi date today. So a small sell off was expected. Then new highs. Gl
"Everybody cried that General Mills paid too much for Blue Buffalo. Now it's looking like they got a bargain. Over more time, only gonna get better. Better for the shareholders too. Covid isn't going away anytime soon. That's sad when the cure is free and some people won't take it. That's fine, stay at home and keep on baking."
"The 10-year, $500 million sustainability-linked bond is tied to measurable improvements on the pathway to General Mills’ commitment to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent across its value chain by 2030.Woke company."
"46,45,44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38. Price action last 30 days. -18 percent. No news."
Safe place to park cash :) will just park more cash if it goes down lol
What a beautiful stock!
"P/E is 16, Yield is 3.45%, Payout ratio is 51% and Trading at $59. For the investor looking for a curiously boring equity with a long term path to profit, you could do worse that GIS. Buy Mark J. SeskiChief Investment OfficerHarvest Portfolio Management, LLC"
"Notice not much of a selloff on a big down day. I f you think the markets are gonna tank, good safe stock to own. If you think the economy and the markets are gonna crash. Good safe stock to own. Folks gotta eat, I your looking for 300% upside, your at the wrong place and those days may be over. Welcome home to safety that has returned to investors for more than 100 years!!"
where is the div. declaration?
Nice to see the market finally giving GIS some respect..
"wow, the General is looking strong now."
Why has this stock done nothing for so many years?
"wow, finally some nice movement upwards."
Excellent strides by GIS regarding the climate emergency and metrics today! I enjoy investing in a company that till has integrity!
"1 Bitcoin is worth the same as 1000 shares of general mills kind of hard for me to wrap my mind around that,, one is way over valued or one is way undervalued one or the other..."
"a food stock going parabolic on mediocre volume after posting decelerating growth, very interesting indeed"
"Bought at $38. YAY! I just thought I would see the dividend for the next six months, no idea it would go up like this so short-term."
"Another down day on the market. Another up day for GIS. Go ahead and get used to this. Fleeing to safety is a wise investment before the market corrects its self. A big correction is coming, this country has too much debt for the stock market to go up forever. Dividend paying value stocks will be the big winner"
"At the rate it is going, cereal is all some people will be able to afford…and the cats gotta eat."
