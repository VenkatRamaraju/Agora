"Billion in share buybacks at this price are going to have a massive impact in a few years. Easy 20+ stock by 2023. Wouldn’t be surprised either if we hit $30 by 12/22. Just buy, you’ll be happy."
Not easy to accumulate for Hedge Funds
I heard about TME the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"The online music paying ratio is increasing steadily. This is the primary driver of TME’s ability to capture its massive TAM through 2030 for comparison, S Korea’s ratio is 90%, and US is over 70%, implying a 7-9x increase over the long term in paying ratio for TME. Other online media in China such as video boasts a 30%+ paying ratio currently, demonstrating the Chinese willingness to pay for online media. These metrics relate to the long term opportunity for TME, and investors would be well-advised to exploit short term disruption unrelated to these long term fundamentals, which is the type of opportunity shrewd investors historically feed on."
"At this price, why TME only buy 1M shares? Wonder how much is left on the 1B buyback."
Vincent Yu from Needham set price target at $18!
Why UP? Because it is worth $20+
"Spotify Announces Stock Repurchase Program, Up to $1.0 Billion"
Best chinese stock to buy?
Chinese stocks capitulate today.
The market is overreacting. Investors now can easily get a 30% pop when this settles back at $10.Tencent is a growing company.
"Oversold till $15, then still plenty of room to grow. $30+ quite real, should not be surprise."
The only question is how long can the Hedge funds hold TME's stock price down? With TME having 13.37 cash per share and a book value of 30.98 and a positive EPS quarter over quarter this 8 dollar range is not going to last very long. Good luck to all Longs
China just cut the amount of time played for entertainment online gaming. Will they also regulate the amount of time for music next? Wouldn't surprise me having a socialist/communist government they can do anything they please. America seems to want the same thing.
Look for the late rally. Early trading is geared to scare retail.
Spotify is not yet profitable. Cash flow growth rate for the last 3 years is negative. For the last 5 years is 1.3%. TME is profitable. Cash flow growth rate for the last 3 years was 42%. Cash flow growth rate for the last 5 years was 75%.Investing is all about generating cash. Who would you rather own?
"Fitch Ratings - Hong Kong - 23 Aug 2021: Fitch Ratings has affirmed China-based Tencent Music Entertainment Group's (TME) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured rating at 'A'. The Outlook is Stable.The affirmation reflects the company's strong linkage with its parent, Tencent Holdings Limited (A+/Stable). We rate TME on a top-down basis, notching the IDRs by a single notch below Tencent's IDR on the strong linkages, as assessed under our Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria. TME's Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) is 'bbb+', but with reduced headroom as we expect its social entertainment services to be in a transition phase."
China’s top government body issued guidelines Monday pledging to boost cross-border cooperation with U.S. regulators on accounting issues. The announcement followed a statement from China’s security regulator in which it said it would work to enhance conditions for cooperation on company audits during the second half of the year.

How is the Spotify market cap 4 times higher than TME? Makes absolutely no sense to me.

"China is the most populous country in the world with almost 19% of the total world population. Current estimates are there are 400 million ""middle class"" Chinese. China has about 1/3rd of the world's total middle class population and along with India has managed a consistent GDP growth rate of 7% for the last 5 years.Middle class people with disposable incomes spend money on discretionary items like the products/services TME sells. By the end of Q3 we will learn the pundits who were all talking on TV about China risk are all now putting their money into China again after knocking down the price of Chinese stocks with their scary headlines. Same game they have been playing for many years.https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-middle-class-5-questions-answered/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20size%20of%20China%E2%80%99s%20middle%20class%3F,is%20less%20than%20one-third%20of%20China%E2%80%99s%20total%20population."
Cathie Wood bought Chinese stock yesterday....
We have a cash balance of 4 Billion USD and NAV of 8.1 Billion. Also we expect to make profits in future periods. Fundamentally speaking the current share price makes no sense at all.

"TME selling is not done, it's OVERDONE. Will only moving one direction from here... TME bought back USD$212M worth of shares past qtr around $16.5/share... Yes, Chinese stocks are risky, check their market share, financial statements, PE ratio, and growth. If you want less risk than TME, go get a CD at your bank with 0.8% interest gain per year."

Wow Fitch affirms the strong rating. Let the rise begin guys

"TME with 800MM shares. C'mon, someone needs to have a talk with their advisors. They need to buy back at least 500M shares."
"All parents would quietly applaud the gaming regulation and ultimately so would schools, universities employers and the economy."
Rblx lost money and gets an upgrade . This stock is a cash cow and keep getting downgraded.
Omg. I bought this at $8 a share yesterday. What in going on?

Tencent bought $275m+ of its own stock in the last 3 trading days. If TME management is paying attention they should also follow suit. Put the $4b cash to use.
"Yesterday TME had its' second best % gaining day in the last year. But the $ move was not even in the top 25 at $0.62. The highest closing price increase for a day was back in March when it increased $1.90 in one day during a string of 6 positive days and increased $5.43. That increase was when the stock had positive hysteria and it quickly dropped back from $30 to $20. Based on the relatively low PE for a high growth stock the true value is probably closer to the $20 level, discounted for the China sovereign risk. Will be interesting to see how quickly we can get there."
Back to 20s and upward faster than the way down. Will adapt to new regulation very quickly
Tencent bought $102m more of its own shares after $70m odd previous day (filings on HKEX). If Tencent is doing buybacks soon TME should too
