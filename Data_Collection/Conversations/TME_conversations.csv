Company hasn’t been buying any shares once the price fell below 15. The average price has been 16+. I guess they are waiting for this madness to end before dipping feet with buybacks
Anybody think this will be 20 by December?
Wow. I'm glad I am broke because I would have bought this in the $12's.
Someone buying into a great company at a major discount today. One year this is over $20 no problem. Likely at ATH. Panic selling….

We have a cash balance of 4 Billion USD and NAV of 8.1 Billion. Also we expect to make profits in future periods. Fundamentally speaking the current share price makes no sense at all.

Omg. I bought this at $8 a share yesterday. What in going on?
Chinese stocks capitulate today.
It looks like a casino - Shorts will be burned soon
Good luck to all longs here. Burn those retail shorts. 
Soon TME will be able to repurchase all retail shares with one go if it keeps dropping like this. Huge panic selling and most probably some margin calls involved here as well.Current market cap of free float is less than 5 Billion. Soon they will start buying shares back in the open market. They still have 800 Million to spend.
The share cannot breath. Hedge funds are unloading shares continusouly. 45mill volume today
CCP and Chinese would like to thank all the paper hands for the cheap shares. They will start to buy back the shares next week. Cheers
"$TME $TME SAMR’s new ruling mandates non-exclusive music contracts with consumption driven pricing,while explicitly prohibiting prepayment of contract fees. This will effectively lower industry-wideroyalty payments, driving operating leverage to TME’s long-term business model. In an attemptto gain a dominant position in online music streaming, TME signed expensive and exclusive musiccontracts in 2017-2018 that expired this year. In contrast to the western world, the top five musiclabels in China only contribute 20-30% of total play counts, thus lowering the music label’s relativebargaining power. TME currently pays over 2b RMB in quarterly music licensing costs, and willmeaningfully lower this cost while moving to a more variable cost structure. TME’s quarterly sublicense revenue of 200-250m RMB implies that TME is able to offset only a fraction of its contractual licensing costs. Even a 10% reduction in licensing expenses will drive a 250bps expansion to TME’s operating margin."

STRONG BUY
Massive volume.Short covering unavoidable in the next 1-2 days.
"An April report by Reuters suggested that Tencent Holdings was facing a fine as big as 10 billion yuan, and TME may potentially be required to sell some of its streaming platforms, including Kugou（酷狗音乐）and Kuwo（酷我音乐）, in order to give up market dominance on music streaming. It is understood that TME had been petitioning the SAMR for a much smaller fine for that it is perfectly willing to follow through with the regulators. As for the aforementioned platforms, Tencent would not be required to spin them off to meet compliance."
"""Tencent sources indicated that while the order takes away short term platform safety, the company generally sees the new order as a clear and good move towards open competition on the market. And they are particularly comforted by the final amount of the SAMR fine, which definitely doesn’t impact the business operation as much as the previously reported billion number."""

"The February 2021 closure of Xiami Music, a niche music streaming platform and social network owned by Alibaba, brought even more public and regulatory attention to TME, as it would seem like even Alibaba can’t fend off Tencent. Rumors began to float that TME were facing antitrust investigations. (Meanwhile, Tencent itself is indeed the target of many recent antitrust investigations that revolved around its acquisitions of shares of other Chinese internet companies, like Xiaohongshu, Sougou, or Cheetah Mobile.)"
"In for another 2,000 shares at $8.99. Getting totally cremated on this one. If I liked it at 14-15 I guess I have to like it at 9 (cold sweat)"

"This was forecasted already. And the fine is 77k, which means nothing."

Hedgies and big investors already made their play this is just retail or smallish funds playing shuffle board.
From tomorrow on TME may resume its share buy back. I'm expecting a nice rebound once they start to pump the remaining 800 Million to the market.

Daily RSI is at 16 lol
You should've sold long ago there's no enforced US regulatory measures in these Chinese stocks. China can do whatever they want with your investment into their companies.
Let the music play!
The only question is how long can the Hedge funds hold TME's stock price down? With TME having 13.37 cash per share and a book value of 30.98 and a positive EPS quarter over quarter this 8 dollar range is not going to last very long. Good luck to all Longs
Buy signal
"TME selling is not done, it's OVERDONE. Will only moving one direction from here... TME bought back USD$212M worth of shares past qtr around $16.5/share... Yes, Chinese stocks are risky, check their market share, financial statements, PE ratio, and growth. If you want less risk than TME, go get a CD at your bank with 0.8% interest gain per year."
"The HFs are playing with Retail investors/us! But if you want to do money - hold on, Gents! I bet on a different Stock but the shorts are everywhere! HOLD and you will do a nice profit. Sell and let HFs laugh and take hour money. That’s so simple!"
Same story dished out every day.Each time it should have less impact.

When I said it would be difficult to breach 11 I never thought it would be back down here.
Any paper hands sold last week ? CCP and Chinese thanks you. they getting it cheap
no uncertainty anymore + auditing cooperation. ADR are back
"Guys, the fine is waaaay below what was expected. And also they will still have the license. It's not as if they will loose them. They just now have to share it with competitors. Also people won't just randomly switch the music apps they use. TME has roughly 900 Million users of which only 60 Million are paying. So the is still huge potential here.But yes please feel free to sell guys so I can get in cheaper Only my personal opinion and no recommendation to trade in this share."
Just wait till the buy back kicks in...
"Looks like capitulation today, oversold. il am adding to my position"
I think we found a bottom between 9.5 and 11 UsD.Once results are released TME can resume their share repurchase programme and we can hopefully see a nice share increase. Hopefully they will up the share repurchase programme to 2 Billion at these levels. They have enough cash to do this.Remember they also need a higher share price to get a secondary listing in Hong Kong. So I believe management will soon start to push the price. Just my personal opinion and no recommendation to trade in thus share.
Is the fine only 80k usd!!!??? OMG.. TME will be 30usd per share.

Spotify is not yet profitable. Cash flow growth rate for the last 3 years is negative. For the last 5 years is 1.3%. TME is profitable. Cash flow growth rate for the last 3 years was 42%. Cash flow growth rate for the last 5 years was 75%.Investing is all about generating cash. Who would you rather own?
Regulation happens everywhere including the US. If you want a great company at a great price prepare to shovel money into the fire. Call your low ($5) and set limits good til canceled every $0.20 down and let it rip for many years. My two biggest gains in life were also my 2 biggest losses at first. Bought axti at 3.50 every $0.20 down to $1.80. Was cremated and then vindicated. Blood on the streets.

"uber were down 3$ after earning report, but +2$ next day.... reversal of fortune can happen under 24 hours."
"Yesterday TME had its' second best % gaining day in the last year. But the $ move was not even in the top 25 at $0.62. The highest closing price increase for a day was back in March when it increased $1.90 in one day during a string of 6 positive days and increased $5.43. That increase was when the stock had positive hysteria and it quickly dropped back from $30 to $20. Based on the relatively low PE for a high growth stock the true value is probably closer to the $20 level, discounted for the China sovereign risk. Will be interesting to see how quickly we can get there."

Hopefully we will end green today and that we found a bottom. From today onwards the company can resume its share buy back. Also I'm pretty sure all those short sellers need to rebuy their shares at these levels.
After a struggle it seems like we may finally breach 11 today. Let’s hope that’s the case.
US Hedge funds must stop manipulating the price
"I'm sad as you are, sold TME at 50% loss. I invested in TME because of Tencent as big company. 1) cannot see the bottom, hence dont know when gonna rebounce. 2) gonna be long before US confidence invest in China again (let the dust settle, before rebounce), 3) Analyst keep cutting target price in half. from PE 0.40 calculation TME value at 8-12$, because growth stall (politic, competition, etc). listen to Earning Transcript you will understand why it crash on ER.4) US maket is over value now, Vug and Nasdaq was tripple top. still unable to break through. 5) Stop your ego, if Hedge funds is sell, there must be a reason, you are not smarter than them.1st time comment on Yahoo, Hope it help..."

I heard about TME the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"good earnings, down 11%?"
"TME was $9.20 before and then it popped to $32…this is a game for the hedge funds!! Take it as low as they can, load up amd then pop it back…"
"China is the most populous country in the world with almost 19% of the total world population. Current estimates are there are 400 million ""middle class"" Chinese. China has about 1/3rd of the world's total middle class population and along with India has managed a consistent GDP growth rate of 7% for the last 5 years.Middle class people with disposable incomes spend money on discretionary items like the products/services TME sells. By the end of Q3 we will learn the pundits who were all talking on TV about China risk are all now putting their money into China again after knocking down the price of Chinese stocks with their scary headlines. Same game they have been playing for many years.https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-middle-class-5-questions-answered/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20size%20of%20China%E2%80%99s%20middle%20class%3F,is%20less%20than%20one-third%20of%20China%E2%80%99s%20total%20population."
"Lastly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn't actually started the three-year countdown to delist Chinese stocks. Instead, the SEC has only issued interim rules instead of starting the delisting process.That delay suggests the U.S. is hesitant to delist Chinese stocks, which would likely hurt the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and discourage other foreign companies from listing their shares on U.S. exchanges. If this countdown never actually starts -- and China eases off its regulatory restrictions -- investors could consider Chinese stocks worthy investments again."

64% of the shares are held by Tencent and Spotify. Meaning only 4 Billion Market Cap remains in the open market. Once the share buyback kicks in we should see a good recovery hopefully. Just my own opinion.

"The size of the fine is a trifle for Tencent, which is one of the world’s largest tech conglomerates. That compares with figures of $1.5 billion or more that have been discussed in financial circles and local media.Moreover, the new ruling appears to only confirm the direction that regulators have already been pushing.For years, Tencent Music elbowed out competitors with exclusive digital distribution contracts with the three major labels, Universal, Warner and Sony. It would then sub-license those catalogues out to competitors like NetEase — often for double or triple the original price.Tencent Music was previously investigated in 2018, which resulted in a commitment from the firm to drop some of its exclusive contracts at the end of their three-year duration. The probe was suspended in 2019.Since then, Tencent Music has moved towards non-exclusive deals. In May, Sony Music Entertainment signed both a new direct China digital distribution deal with rival streamer NetEase Cloud Music and a multi-year extension of its existing agreement with Tencent Music. NetEase has also been able to sign a strategic partnership with Warner Chappell Music for access to lyrics and sign a direct licensing agreement with Universal Music Group. Tencent Music and Tencent are both part of a consortium that owns 20% of UMG."

Attractive price and great value. TME have 800M users in China. Only 11usd per share is too cheap. Wait just 1year. The price will be 30usd per share or more.
This is definitely someSort of conspiracy. There is no way this should go down like this. I ha e read all these goodThings on the internet and this board . If those places say buy then it should go up . Definitely a conspiracy . ThereCan be no other explanation. This stock should be like 200
Guys TME has the revenue growth as well as the user base. The fines issued are nothing compared to what was expected. The HF are just trying to get in cheap. Just my own opinion and no recommendation to trade this share.

"$BIDU, and $IQ of who Baidu is the parent company of, have been the most compliant with CCP regulations.$BABA recently became compliant. $TCEHY is improving and had a huge buyer sweep in in Hong Kong Yesterday despite going down.All those stocks, and $TME, $HUYA, $DOYU and $BILI and the $KWEB ETF are overdue for a huge bounce.It will come very soon. Within 4 weeks.Every single stock will be higher than it was end of June by the beginning of September. Raging China bull is among us."
"China is still in the process of building a social safety net that is largely undefined and underfunded, and it has no tax on personal capital gains. In 2020 China had more billionaires than the U.S. did, and it outpaces the U.S. three to one in minting them. Consequently, inequality is greater in China than in the United States, measured by the Gini coefficient."
Tencent Music Entertainment is up 5.53% to 7.63
I see $4 as bottom.
They shorted until 7.now they are long until?

"However, TME still retains contractual exclusivity with mainly the following categories: 1) several top Asian labels, including Mainland China’s ModernSky, Korea’s YG, and JVR, which is owned by pop singer Jay Chou, 2) a few less dominating western label companies, such as Cooking Vinyl and Kobalt Music; 3) music rights to popular TV and internet reality shows, such as Youth with you（青春有你）and Chuang（创造营）."

China just cut the amount of time played for entertainment online gaming. Will they also regulate the amount of time for music next? Wouldn't surprise me having a socialist/communist government they can do anything they please. America seems to want the same thing.
So volume is way down as people on vacation. Will pop when summer over. Loading up anything under $10

"Fitch Ratings - Hong Kong - 23 Aug 2021: Fitch Ratings has affirmed China-based Tencent Music Entertainment Group's (TME) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured rating at 'A'. The Outlook is Stable.The affirmation reflects the company's strong linkage with its parent, Tencent Holdings Limited (A+/Stable). We rate TME on a top-down basis, notching the IDRs by a single notch below Tencent's IDR on the strong linkages, as assessed under our Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria. TME's Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) is 'bbb+', but with reduced headroom as we expect its social entertainment services to be in a transition phase."
SPOTIFY own 20%
$IQ $HUYA $MOMO $TME $HUYA $YY $DOYU Repeat after me ! I will NEVER invest Chinese stocks ever again!!
Less time for gaming and more time for music!!!! Bad for tcehy and good news for TME
This thing still can’t decide waht to do. Cannot tell if there is any real accumulating going on here.
Why selling at 10 when you can at 30 after few months?

"According to insiders, Tencent music will soon launch NFT encrypted art platform service ""TME digital collection"" in August. At present, QQ music is in internal test. The platform will release virtual digital collections to users based on blockchain technology, which may be applied to digital albums and limited peripheral products in the future. If the news is true, QQ music will be the first music platform in China to release digital collection NFT, and the platform technology is likely to be launched synchronously in Tencent music's products."

"Spotify Announces Stock Repurchase Program, Up to $1.0 Billion"
Vincent reiterated coverage of Tencent Music Enter Gr with a rating of Buy and set a new price target of $18.00 from $25.00 previously
Tencent bought $102m more of its own shares after $70m odd previous day (filings on HKEX). If Tencent is doing buybacks soon TME should too
2021-03: $30+2021-08: $10-Is it serious?
Shorters wait the end of the trading session to attack. Weak reaction from the share should have been over 8$ by now
Curious about TME ownership of UMG. How much of the 20% interest is owned by Tencent holdings vs TME. Thx
"I think this stock will struggle to get back to $15. Ask yourself, if you got back to within 10% of your cost basis would you sell or hold?I am not a short. Just another retail investor who got burned on this one. Need to learn how to use stop loss limits in the future."

Good volume today we should expect reaction by tomorrow if the general climate is stable.
Also TME has a close to 3% stake in Spotify which is worth 1.2 Billion as well as 20% stake in Universal Music.
China’s top government body issued guidelines Monday pledging to boost cross-border cooperation with U.S. regulators on accounting issues. The announcement followed a statement from China’s security regulator in which it said it would work to enhance conditions for cooperation on company audits during the second half of the year.

"Yu assigned a Buy rating on the stock, and lowered his price target from $25 to $18. This more conservative, yet bullish, target currently represents a potential 12-month upside of 102.47%."
Back to 20s and upward faster than the way down. Will adapt to new regulation very quickly
At this price Tencent Holding should buy all float. 617 x 10 = 6B is nothing for TENCENT. Then making an offer for the latest shares ($17)
On the positive side TME has over 14 bucks per share in cash and will be buying shares back at this discounted price. So in the long run even though it is a ugly day not so ugly for the company. Good luck to all Longs.
Wow Fitch affirms the strong rating. Let the rise begin guys
They need to cut the ping pong time down . It is killing that country
"I wonder why it keeps falling. Strong growth in Revenue, paid subscribers went up. CEO mentions he does not expect huge impact of the license fine. What am I missing?"
"Vincent assigned a Buy rating to $TME, with a price target of $24.00."
"Revenue, paid users, earnings per share, buyback.... all growth!!!"
Forward p/e 0.5
Who can sell at this price after great NFT news? Only HFs manipulating price.
Im buying now great gamble 
"Billion in share buybacks at this price are going to have a massive impact in a few years. Easy 20+ stock by 2023. Wouldn’t be surprised either if we hit $30 by 12/22. Just buy, you’ll be happy."
Double swords down - Chinese govt and institution dumping..this will be long term at least one year from now
I will not buy another single share until 5. That’s all it’s worth. This is why it keeps going down.
"420,000 shares already traded after market. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tme/after-hours"
"What would you do with a large amount of January 22 $15 call options? I'm down 3/4 of my investment. I came in right before the regulatory BS. I'd waited and waited and saw it forming a nice base and got b..slapped immediately afterward. If they take it private, do companies do that at a premium? Never had a stock where that happened."
Best chinese stock to buy?
"Maybe you can buy around 5 , bu the chart better say so and nothing or nobody else"
Looks like I pick the right time to go long regardless of what Vincent says.
Put buyers
Will it ever u turn
Holding until $20+

"China will continue to allow eligible Chinese companies to list in the U.S., as CNBC cited the remarks of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai in a video meeting with key investment banks Wednesday.Cross-border stock listings can also be conducted with the variable interest entity (VIE) structure, sources quoted the regulators. The VIE is a legal structure allowing international investors to obtain shares of Chinese companies in the U.S..Yet, the VIE structure must be adjusted if there is any national security concern, said the sources.http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/news/aafn-con/now.1116067/latest-news"
$TME reminds me $JUMIA (FROM 40 to 2 then 2 to 60) but TME is a cash machine!
How is the Spotify market cap 4 times higher than TME? Makes absolutely no sense to me.
"China's Growing economy will overtake the USA by 2030. Great balance sheet in a booming economy that loves streaming services music. Long and STRONG!$40+ a shair in the coming 2 years. This company is not going bankrupt, just needs to overcome the bad press against Chinese company and TEMPORARY regulation! Here till $40+"
77k fine vs babas fine of 2.8billion Hahahhaha I’m not worried!! TME has its 4Billion cash Safe :)))
Good volume today. We should expect reaction soon...Stay tuned....
"Pretty obvious now this is a large US tech push to crush chinese competitors. Zero substance in it, but the price will get shorted, the news stories with no validity will start to crank out and like that everyone will believe a totally fabricated reality. Sound familiar face diaper people?"
"Is Tencent Music Entertainment Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Tencent Music Entertainment Group has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate."
TME is a great compagnie but USA like bankruptcy AMC/GME
Oversold. Time for a swing trade here
"In a report issued on August 17, Jefferies also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $16.00 price target."
Nice little Hammer on the hour chart. Let's see how we close today. Looks like we will be getting a hammer as well on the daily chart. Clearly the share buyback has resumed. Yes baby 
"The online music paying ratio is increasing steadily. This is the primary driver of TME’s ability to capture its massive TAM through 2030 for comparison, S Korea’s ratio is 90%, and US is over 70%, implying a 7-9x increase over the long term in paying ratio for TME. Other online media in China such as video boasts a 30%+ paying ratio currently, demonstrating the Chinese willingness to pay for online media. These metrics relate to the long term opportunity for TME, and investors would be well-advised to exploit short term disruption unrelated to these long term fundamentals, which is the type of opportunity shrewd investors historically feed on."
are we going back $11 ?
"TME with 800MM shares. C'mon, someone needs to have a talk with their advisors. They need to buy back at least 500M shares."

"Amazing how people hold onto hope when stocks fall and AllThey say is , but look at the numbers ! This thing should be triple whatIt is trading at.

If a stock is going down there is a reason snd thst will not be known immediately i most cases but it will comeOut , marketLooksAhead a minimum of six months"
"842,000 shares traded pre-market is a good indicator for a green day. Would love a short squeeze."
Cathie Wood bought Chinese stock yesterday....

Blame China govt for stock loss. The company is doing very well. I dont think it is delisted. But it takes time to absorb the effects before going back
(http://financialdeals.tech) has been the best thing that’s happened to my portfolio! The stock picks are top-notch and well researched. I highly recommend them for any trader out there!
"With regard to the exclusive music label rights, the situation is more complicated than the SAMR order implies. Essentially, TME had that exclusive rights for a long time. But several months ago, the exclusivity had dissolved greatly. Immediately prior to the order, Tencent already lost most of its exclusive rights with top western labels. This order would continue to strip away that with domestic and Asian labels.https://en.pingwest.com/a/8949"
Trust me Tencent Music is the top underrated stock
way oversold
