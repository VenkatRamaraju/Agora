Document Cloud revenue was $493 million, representing 31 percent year-over-year growth.”“Adobe repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares during the quarter.”Very good ER. Excellent guidance, better than expected. Conf call following. Do not pay attention to AH price action. Big and real action will be tomorrow."
"Digital media and marketing software firm Adobe (ADBE) late Tuesday easily beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal third quarter. The San Jose, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $3.11 a share on sales of $3.94 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 3. Analysts expected Adobe earnings of $3.01 a share on sales of $3.89 billion, according to FactSet. In the year-earlier period, Adobe earned $2.57 a share on sales of $3.225 billion.https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-adobe-beats-fiscal-q3-targets/?src=A00220"
"ADBE, again today is the stock everyone should be buying!!! Selling at a 4% discount to CRM! Adobe is a better company than CRM. I own both!"
What’s going on? Nasdaq is way up and we’re in the red? News?
Look at the giant red candle at the close. No surprise here.

"Look at the numbers and you see ADBE beat consensus estimates for both EPS and Revenue. Yet the stock price is down close to 4% here in the AH session and should go down more, for a total deflation of 8% plus, tomorrow during the regular session. Why?? Because the share price today PRIOR to earnings release was pricing in an even BIGGER beat on both baselines. That is why I gave myself a 77-80% chance of success with this trade, and that is why my trading system works so well. The ONLY chance ADBE had to go up on this ER, was for them to deliver absolute blow-out numbers and very strong forward Guidance. The chance of that happening was about 20-23%. So, I win on the trade even though the company delivered a perfectly decent earnings release. :-) Adobe Systems BeatsAdobe Systems (ADBE) reported 3rd Quarter August 2021 earnings of $3.11 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $3.01 per share on revenue of $3.9 billion. The company said it expects fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of approximately $3.18 per share on revenue of approximately $4.07 billion. The current consensus earnings estimate is $3.08 per share on revenue of $4.04 billion for the quarter ending November 30, 2021."
adbe==The only big cap software stocks are undervalued by 30%;Target $820
"16 billion in revenue with a 300 billion market cap, uh huh"
"Although P/E is a little high, I started a small position yesterday. This stock is down over 16% in the last month, which is a healthy pullback after the run we’ve seen in tech. ADBE isn’t going anywhere and it’s a long term hold."
"$KPLT short % hit 26%. The shorts are stagnating, fewer are entering into this stock. They are hoping for a loss in the lawsuits for Katapult which won’t happen. These lawsuits are normal for new stocks with volatile price action. Nothing to worry about. The potential for this company is huge. Big companies like $CRM & $ADBE are not fools to collaborate with a failing company. They know Katapults worth and so should you!Hold and see this fly high."

Good buying opportunity... just bought 10 shares!
ADBE is one of the most undervalued software stocks:Target $750
Thanks for the profits shorts!
"Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.94 billion in its third quarter of fiscal year 2021, which represents 22 percent year-over-year growth.GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.52, representing 28 percent year-over-year growth, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.11, representing 21 percent year-over-year growth.Digital Media segment revenue was $2.87 billion, which represents 23 percent year-over-year growth. Creative revenue grew to $2.37 billion, representing 21 percent year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue was $493 million, representing 31 percent year-over-year growth.Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) increased $455 million quarter over quarter to $11.67 billion exiting the quarter. Creative ARR grew to $9.87 billion and Document Cloud ARR grew to $1.79 billion."
Added at open this morning along with SQ and NVDA. Great stocks long term.
"I'm out on the swing trade positions since ADBE has hit the lower high in the recent bounce back, previous high is about $674 and recent high hit is about $659. So it may have a chance to retest the recent low of $575 to $550. Will lean on the cautious side in recent portfolio holdings."
"Adobe is ""one of the crown jewels of software,"" a Wells Fargo analyst said Monday as he initiated coverage of the company with an overweight rating and a $770 price target, one day before software giant is scheduled to report third-quarter earningshttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/1acd2e57-c6ae-3e1e-bb29-9e72e146b227/adobe-initiates-at-overweight.html"
Sad to see everyone selling ADOBE here. when you see sell-offs like this you should double down and buy more. Thats just what I did.
Day trading is for the poor....
"Looking to Sell Short a lot of shares of ADBE today, as a Pure Earnings play to hold through earnings release and Cover tomorrow. ADBE is overvalued and poised to sell off 4-12% in direct response to weak and disappointing earnings numbers and/or forward Guidance. If I can get Short at $650+ that will be a great gift, but willing to do the play at the $640+ level too. Citigroup analyst hit the nail on the head yesterday when he lowered his one year price target on this Bloated Baby to $575. ADBE is priced to beyond perfection at $640+, meaning if it wasn't for Irrational Exuberance permeating the market, ABDE should sell off even if they deliver blowout beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates along with strong forward Guidance after today's close. Bottom line, I see a 77-80% chance of a price drop in direct response to earnings release. Too good to pass up for a veteran Pure Earnings Short Seller. Good Luck!"
Big dip on great earnings. Will buy more at open. I have a feeling this will move up throughout the day.
Beaten down poor Adobe. Wish for now that I wasn’t long. Will take time to recover
I am sure sometime this week they will rotate out of banks and energy and buy techs. $630 by Friday if not tomorrow.
I am coining NAAGAAM. These are blue-chip tech you just don't short because they are top feeders everyone else in the industry relies on:nVidiaAppleGoogleAdobeAMDMicrosoftAmazon
Have been adding shares for the past couple of weeks on the sell-off. This is a GREAT stock to own for years to come. Heading back to all time highs. Just a matter of time.
When you were buying tech a few weeks back and everyone was shorting it.You are supposed to short buggy whips stocks. LoL

Hope y’all scooped up some shares around $553! Great company. Fair valuation models had it at $560. Bulls on parade.
Same happened recently for $DOCU after earnings next day it was up more than $30. Hope the same will happen tomorrow with $ADBE
"ADBE can't hold the $620.00 level here, during the conference call. A very Bearish indicator for tomorrow. I see this sliding through the $6-teens tomorrow and likely going under $600 at some point during the regular session tomorrow. I will look to Cover at the $599.99 level tomorrow, understanding that the company does have value and bargain-hunters are likely to come in at some point..."
Inflation is out of control......We need a company that is going to pay us back some money! If apple can pay a dividend so can adobe! Demand more!
Companies having problems with their supply chains. Not an issue for Adobe!
"ADBE Conference Call coming up in a few minutes, at 5 PM ET. Of course they will try to spin the numbers as positively as possible. But the issue is forward Guidance. Any HINT of softness in anything they say, will drive this down through the teens for the rest of this AH session and set the stage for -$600 during the regular session tomorrow. I could Cover this Short right now for a really nice profit. Would be the ""safe"" thing to do. But no, gonna stay Short because I see the odds favoring further price erosion tomorrow."
I came here looking to buy but then looked at the financials...talk about overvalued....geez.
