Facebook will buy Nuance. Mark this post.
I have gain of 116% for my calls expiring on July 16. I am very tempted to sell it. Any thoughts?
"Levi & Korsinsky announced it has commenced an investigation of Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN) concerning possible breaches of fiduciary duty."
"Solid quarter with a better balance sheet than ever before. Oh yes and as I've said before, Benjamin is a breath of fresh air! Seems like very few from the past are still here so guess I'll be talking to myself going forward. 10,420 shares left and I'll continue to hold."
"Again, tracking the NASDQ. Closing over say 46.50 give or take would start a movement past 50. Yes oh yes, I don’t know anything. They’re loans are locked in for a while so why does inflation mater. Well that’s above my head!"
Can someone please give me a logical reason for this not trading at $56? No bots or spam please.
What's the play ???... MSFT swap shares or all cash ???... or both...
Blow out quarter.
"Does anyone (if anyone is left), believe that the reason for the delay in Mark B's start date with Danny T's interim status, means it will be a different company on 4/23? Just wondering out loud given the Evercore estimate for the automotive division!"
"this is a 70 stock, why gives to MSFT at 56, I have much higher expectation...."
Annual meeting vote tally - has anyone seen any press release or SEC filing giving voting results for BOD @ Annual Meeting that took place 2/28/2018. I can't find plus I am not sure what SEC requirements are for filing this. It is interesting that in the BOD list on NUAN website they still show Sanjay as having been nominated for BOD and vote to take place at 2018 Annual Meeting. Very Interesting. Oh and yes - very slimy but that is typical for this BOD & Management.
Impressive volume Friday
A 16 b dollar valuation from Microsoft puts Nuan shares at 56...mixed feelings on this because I think nuan will be much higher in a year
why would a stock with $56 cash offer drop 3 points?
guy on c.n.b.c.just recommended this
"Billy, check this out! Just read the DEF 14A. Go to Proposal #5. ""each of our directors received an alarming number of negative votes in 2017 including 68 million in negative votes for one insider director, Kathy Martin"""
"NUAN is a Voice AI company....its transforming itself in a great way (majority of that is already done, now it is about sales) and new growth is coming from high margin SaaS subscription services..in healthcare and enterprise. For comparison, look at Salesforce $CRM business model and stock price growth ($NUAN's subscription revenue is high quality, stable and recession-proof). NUAN is a market leader with a a strong moat..the great thing about this company is that it has 700+ AI developers, 3000+ patents and it is one of the few companies who invests back in the R&D (it is increasing its R&D budget from 10 to 13% while narrowing the focus on profitable use cases). Top-line is increasing by 25-30% YoY growth. Regarding the demand trends, just check how many of the people around you prefer to talk to Alexa or Siri..use voice instead of text..? $NUAN is great investment - it's new journey has just started,.. I expect accelerated momentum starting with it upcoming earnings report in 2020 .BUY !!!"
So will I have the option yet to exchange my Nuance shares for Microsoft shares come closing day? I think other shareholders have expressed the same here. Long term holder and believer in Nuance since 2004. Glad to see how new management has righted this company.
"Four (4) Law Firms investigating Nuance. Lifshitz Law Firm, P.C. Announces Investigation, Halper Sadeh LLP Continues to Investigate, Monteverde & Associates PC Announces an Investigation of Nuance, Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC InvestigatesThey seeking big pay day? Seeking to block sale ?"
I was optimistic we would see some follow through today. A bit of a disappointment.
Just when I am about to drop my stock and break even it is down in pre-market. Talk about a poor run company. I wasted 3 plus years of my life watching this stock go no where.
Benjamin took a tutorial from Ricci on how to put out PR's that mean nothing! He will probably buy out GlobeNewswire next:)
"Is the stock halted after hours, after nice earnings beat"
Maybe Ricci should change the name to Nuance Blockchain! Good for 200% jump
Minimum guaranteed 7-8% upside based on $56 agreed upon cash purchase. What's there to think about?
"March 10, 2021 12:17PM ET. “ Citing the recent pullbacks during the tech route, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ive’s names (NYSE: SAIL) and Nuance Communications (NASDAQ: NUAN) to the firm’s Best Idea’s List due to the attractive entry point... NUANCE stays at Outperform and $65. “ Danny Ive’s the INFLATION FIGHTER!!!!!"
"At the height of a tech bull market Ricci's final mark was to bring Nuance back to 2010 levels before bailing. Can't say I'm surprised. But now there's a new CEO and what's he going to do about it? Maybe this turns out to be a bargain price here that Street has bestowed , but time will tell"
"Hi, I'm new to the NUAN discussion board, although I'm familiar with the platform from following other stocks. Does anyone know why NUAN has been on a tear this last few weeks? Would you mind giving me the the headlines? I'm specifically wanting to know if it is worth the money to buy back my covered calls, either outright or choosing a higher strike, later date. Thanks in advance"
"what other similar company would be next for buyout,,any interesting comments??"
"Today should be interesting. The beginning of the ""post Ricci era"" is a reason to celebrate if for no other reason than the constant robbery ever quarter may at least slow down. The remaining management team has a chance to remove a major drag on future performance; that's if there is a future?Good Fortune to All,LT"
"Some things never change...GlobeNewswire at it again with totally worthless PR's and Ricci calling shots as in a new acquisition of Voice Box in my opinion! His motto, if you can't beat em, buy them and overpay too, like the last 18 years"
Does anyone think Benjamin can make any decisions while FrankenbergER is still on the board?
"Clearly being set up for a sale, under $23 a no brainer, after shareholder presentation yesterday watch for strong buy rec's coming out and very high volume trading days as large mutual funds jockey for position"
How about $17 Wednesday afternoon?
When do we get Cerence shares. The stock starts trading tomorrow morning. Nothing in my portfolio so far.
You guys are missing the fact that this deal will be debt free cash free. i.e. current shareholders have to settle the net debt.
"Today, about 20 M shares traded. Tomorrow I think it will be about 5 million shares. From there the price will stabilize"
Why not a deal structured where Nuance shareholders receive MSFT stock in exchange for their Nuan shares ... seems the better option re: capital gains. What’s the advantage to all cash deal?
"Interesting historical note. I'm dating myself. Back in 2001 a company called Lernout & Houspie was valued at $10 billion. It was a fraud, company was a leader in speech recognition. It went bankrupt a company called ScanSoft bought it's assets the predecessor of Nuance. Cheers to those who were long!"
Can someone explain to me why Nuance is dead in the water with this market move? I've given up trying!
"No doubt, friends of Paul exited on the gap up top high $18s. One morning we will wake up and the pain will be over:Takeout at $24/ share cash."
"Oh Billy, don't sell them, you know there is a stock Split coming ? Separating Car / Auto, etc. from the rest of the business ? These always pay off ! Most likely it will be 20 by that time, one will open at 13$, other at 7$ and go up 20% from there. Something along this line... A total of$25 - 30"
It would make sense for Microsoft to acquire Nuance to get a toehold in healthcare. Is that driving Nuance shares lately?
It appears that a +/- trade of 3.5 million shares went through @11:34 am. Volume now looks to be @ 6.27M. Can anyone confirm what I'm seeing?
Why does Ricci still have a job? He earned $2.2M in cash plus millions in stock based comp.The stock is dead money. There has to be a more effective CEO out there that can drive more profits for Nuance and lead the shares to $25 or so.
Would selling off auto be a good thing?
"""Short interest is extremely low for NUAN with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting NUAN."""
will Apple acquire Nuance ?
"Ricci kept paying himself 15 million per year while he kept overpaying for start up companies that never paid off. Now Amazon and Google have made Nuances speech recognition seem outdated. You can't compete with companies that are worth nearly 1 trillion dollars, they will eat you alive. ''King of Speech'' Is crowned to Amazon Alexa, not Nuance. They also paid Benjamin 14.7 million only after being on the job for 6 months. These guys really burnt long shareholders."
"Fairpointe, a Chicago-based investment management firm with $5.3 billion under management, is seeking clarity on when Ricci will depart and who will replace him, Fairpointe portfolio manager Marie Lorden said in an interview.Fairpointe, which owns a 1.77 percent stake in Nuance, has also sent a private letter to the company's board in recent weeks about the issue, Lorden added.Burlington, Massachusetts-based Nuance did not respond to requests for comment."
WOW Now that was impressive quarter. Are we on the right track or what?Market likes it also.
run up as we near the end of the month???
Reached another all time high today. Who would of thought!
Congrats to all those who had the foresight to at least hold on to a large chunk of NUAN. I wonder what AXIOM would have to say about our SSFT holdings today. Nothing positive I'm sure.
MO VOLUME...+
Interesting deal with Nvidia
"Why is $53? When at SEC they said that. What is the purchase price?Nuance is being acquired by Microsoft for $56 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance’s net debt."
NUAN holding up well in the tech rought of late. Maybe this time it's really different? Could it be ricci just didn't know how to put the pieces together? To busy making all the money for himself or his buddies? Ricci was proud of taking the company from nothing to $16 in 15 plus years while lisa su took AMD from $2 to the 70's in 4 or so years. Could it be ricci was OK with a low SP as long as he got his money?
We need a new CEO and a DEF 14A
Back to $16. Ricci is a happy man again. How many spikes since 2007 when nuance was $21/ as the SP was trending up? Hasn't held a gain since.
Fantastic earnings and conference call. Waiting for the spinoff!
Someone bought 1500 Jan'23 $60 Calls at Ask ???What's the logic here?
The MS press release had some legs today. Sold a small % (5%) today.
So has anyone read what's going on or can point me in the right direction with NUAN. I've had shares since last October but all I know is Microsoft is supposedly buying them out at $56 but I haven't found any legit info on the buyout yet.
"Stock up today because front page of USA Today has a favorable article on Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Home. Did I mention The Emperor, a voice and speech recognition guru, and Nuance? No-e!"
Oh what a beautiful day my fellow Board Members! Solid solid solid. No BS and no massive FORM 4 stock sales by the Former EMPEROR that always impacted the bottom line! Hip hip chin chin!
Best stock price action in years. Comments on a price target?
Solid quarter once again! Benjamin is simply a breath of fresh air! They remain focused on their core business. I’m sticking!
Leerink initiates coverage on NUAN at Outperform; Price Target $31
"FYI, buying more between now and earnings! Ricci still lurking in the corner office and I'm hoping his forward guidance comes to fruition. Then?????"
Been in nuance since caere days. Something I have noticed over the years is that left behind stocks seem to rally just before a market fall because so called investors are looking for laggards. Just an observation as I stated. Maybe this time it's different?
maybe it's the nice IPA I'm rnjoyong but I believe we do very well tomorrow... $18's
20/20 hindsight tells me I should have gotten this at $0.54.
NUAN and CRNC both trading @ 22.20. Fundamentally they are both holds for me. Solid Nuance quarter plus they’re trimming down debt and buying back more stock with a healthy cash flow.
"Wish we had the option to be bought out with MSFT shares as well as for cash, would help with the capital gains. But still, congrats long timers for holding on as Nuance continued to evolve - been here myself since 2004"
quite the volume?????
Tomorrow is gonna be good day!Nuance Communications’ (NUAN) “Buy” Rating Reaffirmed at Oppenheimer
I like the company but their revenue is not growing much. Why are you buying this stock?
"1st time ever I heard a Nuance CEO congratulate the employees for a job well done during a conference call! Healthcare cloud revs up yr over yr 20+, Dragon strong 20+ growth qtr over qtr, enterprise firing on solid cylinders and DAX is really providing great results. Interesting to Note, Dan Ive’s asked about the relationship with MSFT to which Bob Dahdah said, “ we just continue to be super pleased and grateful that we have the opportunity to work as closely with them, as we do, I think, we think about the market in similar ways...” Hey this confirms the chatter I’ve been hearing for awhile! It’s not far fetched that the relationship with Microsoft could end up being a game changer event!!! Yep, all systems go!!! Oh and once again, The Chief Kahuna, Benjamin, congratulating the employees for a job well done! What a concept!"
My thoughts are mixed. Business firming up. Benjamin dumped a bunch but hey this isn’t alarming as this was or is the Emperor’s way. Everyone in Management will get a ton of options in this spinoff. I’m tempted to sell my last remaining 10 thousand shares right before the IPO. Yes thoughts? Who’s left from the old days? Anyone?
Results. Not bad. Reaffirmed guidance. This new EMPEROR is a breath of fresh air!
CC at 2 PM. Here we go!
"Hey everyone, long time, no see. Just wanted to comment briefly on something below: Evercore is not a private equity group. It's a financial advisory firm, specialising in M&A, which is a world of a difference. Breaking the company up and selling it part by part appears to be the most probable scenario going forward. Hopefully good news for all of us longs."
Is Mark Benjamin a good choice?
Bloomberg News Flash: MSFT in talks to buy NUAN.
There has to be news pending!!!!! Unusual...unusual...unusual
Bought more. I will vote against the merger. I think MSFT is undervaluing Nuance. I am hoping another suitor will offer $65 or more.
Who is this NUAN - a new high nearly everyday.. Finally a CEO who values shareholders and is proud and excited for his company.
No comments on a 10% down? NUAN just gave up all of January. Is everyone out?
Does anyone know when MSFT will take over NUAN ???...
"$NUAN upgraded to BUY at $23 ...this is just the beginning. More upgrades coming soon, plus the company earnings report on 2/6 expected to perform upside. I am buying and adding more $NUAN to my portfolio. This stock can double or more in 2020!"
Ricci wants the share price as low as possible to maximize his exit package next year!
"Yoda, we will be back at $17 by earnings and the preannouncement deflated any chance of pop! Go figure why Ricci did it?"
"Just received by email a Message Notification from IBKR that NUAN merger will be merged June 15th, 2021That was from their Corportate Actions department."
I'm Kathleen AKA willtori. I have held this stock since before 2000. I do not think this company is going to amount to anything going forward like it hasn't since 2007. I intend to start selling my shares again next year. I am tired of the lack of interest in this company by the investing community.
Mark B's turnaround plan seems to be working! You have to give him Kudos.
"Ok, time for my Cracker Jack technical analysis. Not!!!! Anyway, looks like NUAN needs to close over $51.60 and hold the trend line around $46. Hears hoping!!!"
"FLSA lawsuit. Was only a matter of time. Legal fees, cha-ching. All public record."
in at $52.2. Free money to be made when sold at $56 in a few month. Almost $4 per share for a few month of holding.
"When can we expect the form 4s to hit? Paul and gang will be packing their saddle bags and riding into the sunset in short order now that the performance bonus has been ""earned"" and the market makers have the price down to a target level that could be acceptable."
"Nuance just needs to be acquired. Management is good about feeding their own pockets, but not feeding the pockets of their investors."
You're still missing the net debt piece friends. Microsoft is issuing its own new debt to finance the debt. They are not acquiring the company's net debt.
long term this is a buy...barclays upgraded to $60 few days ago. let's see how the earning look like next week
Nuance holds no shares of CRNC after reading all the spinoff legal jargon. Obviously Nuance employees might as stock holders before the spinoff. I also couldn’t find anything on stock options granting Nuance Management after the spin off warrants or Cerence shares so I’m assuming it’s a no.
"Dean I think there is 0 chance Microsoft backs out of a deal that every analyst is saying is a home run for them. I have looked hard for any reason why this is trading at approx 6% discount and it probably just comes down to time. But since Microsoft said by end of year and they don’t screw around, I was a big buyer."
"My guess is a big arbitrager for margin called. Arbitragers will buy the stock on margin to leverage the small gain to be made when the takeover is completed.Margin requirements went up about 50% overnight for NUAN, so someone big got called."
"Beware of November 28. It will tell of Nuance's fate. The more good news articles that come out as we wait, the lower the earnings will be at that date."
Snowing in the Boston burbs. Ohhhhh what a beautiful day!!!!!! Hip hip chin chin!
This is a pos stock. Terribly over paid management and a company with no direction. I am waiting for a few dollars to the upside and than will sell the dog.
can't wait to hear a new voice in a CC! Post earnings bounce possible? I'll take a few cents.
So with new tax breaks for bringing corp off shore funds back into the US and with Apple and IBM (not too sure just how much they hold off shore) sitting on so much Cash---I think there will be a lot of M&A in the next 3 quarters. With Nuan being one of the largest independents left will one of the big dogs come barking and run Ricci off? I think the chances are pretty good. So I hold on.
Prediction...We get a one time $6 dividend and RR takes the rest private at $16.10
"Going to a subscription-based model has proven to pay off nicely for Cisco (after some difficult quarters) Maybe now we're starting to see Nuance follow suit, and that it's similar recurring payment model adding to top & bottom lines, and just as this CEO departs. Could be interesting times ahead."
"On days like today, thank you Mr Softy and Mr Benjamin!"
"Update Related to COVID-19To date, we have not experienced any significant changes in our business that would have a significant negative impact on our consolidated statements of position, operations or cash flows. Management believes any disruption, when and if experienced, would be temporary, however, there is uncertainty around when any disruption might occur, the duration and hence the potential impact. As a result, we are unable to estimate the potential impact on our business as of the date of this filing."
"Why, why, why?"
I have been in this name for a long time. Retained the distributed shares from WP. Always thought this company had huge potential- I'm not alone with that thinking.Now we watch and see if Benjamin can produce. I have no idea why I'm optimistic. Don't be surprised when he cuts costs to the bone. Anyone know of his body of work at ADP?
No traction until after the bell. Which way?
Why preannounce??????????????????????????????????????
"Proxyvote.com - voting until 11:59 on 02/27.After 23 plus years and In the interest of Full Disclosure !!!Against - Against - Against - Against ..... & FOR .... as if it will make any difference.I won't make the meeting on 02/28....flying to Miami on that date and our long anticipated NUANCE CRUISE sails at sunset on 03/01.Carry on Gentlemen &......Good Fortune To All,LT"
I told you we were going to be bought out by Philips
Earnings run up @ the top of the latest short term technical range until Monday.
I wonder how these M&A's typically are handled if you are a former employee and had a stock plan within Nuance. Luckily i hold on to them lol. Is this automatically settled when the deal is executed?
"Andrews & Springer LLC Is Investigating Nuance Communications, Inc. For Potential Breaches of Fiduciary Duty and Securities Violations"
Dumb question here. should I sell my share if it gets higher than 56$ ?! we should get 56$ per share by the end of the year. But what happen if Nuance's stock get higher in price?! (56$++)
"I would like to see more International Clients like the Chec Bank. Seems like a specialty VR player would be attractive vs GOOG, MSFT, AMZ where VR is an ancillary app. Also Enterprise and Commercial in addition to Consumer"

41 million shares short 4/29 and buyout at $56. Why haven't they covered yet?
"Billy, Yoda and Kathleen, Here's to hoping my days are numbered owning this long term hemorrhoid!"
"NEW YORK, Dec. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Purcell Julie & Lefkowitz LLP, a class action law firm dedicated to representing shareholders nationwide, is investigating a potential breach of fiduciary duty claim involving the board of directors of Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN)."
"I'm not the least bit concerned about $17, Yoda! We blow through it but $20 is my goal for the year!"
What’s up...Some consolidation before the next leg up? Wall Street doesn’t like Benjamin’s joining PTC? Stiefel upgrade to $45 which was a downgrade from current price?
Any predictions for tomorrow’s earnings?
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRNCV?p=CRNCV
This POS is showing signs of life! Maybe I did buy at the bottom! How about a sale of the automotive division announced tomorrow and a restructured company with half the present debt of 2.3 billion???

$30 is good to see with respectable volume. Will it hold?
"OK...""Company is moving forward with establishing it's automotive business as a separate reportable segment and business line"" ???????"
Good luck ladies and gents! 1st time I've been totally out for ER in 20 years! Oh well...likely bodes well for you all:)
"No one seriously expected the deal to be blocked by Gov.IMO The spread was maintained by professional traders who just look at these things mechanically, and they just adjust their Arb gap according to their rule of thumb, without spending a lot of in-depth research on the details. I have no other explanation for the large arb gap, anyone has any other opinion?I mostly nibbled (orgy-ed) on options by placing smallish sell orders every day across 14 strikes/expirations and assembled 748 short option contracts. Ending up with Strangles and yielding ~40% return in a Margin account (assuming the deal closes)."
"What y'guys talking about? This is one rock steady company. Eleven years ago on June, 2007 the stock price was $16.64. Today it's $16.33. What is a few cents among friends?"
"So looks like we are still waiting on EU/UK/Australia..Regulatory ApprovalsGeneral Nuance and Microsoft have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory filing andnotification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required or recommended to consummate the mergerand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval under, ornotifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of the European Union and any relevant EuropeanUnion Member States, the United Kingdom and Australia"
how can we take such a haircut when only missing the numbers by 1%. I guess this has been this way for so long it can't dig out. Paul Ricci should be police escorted out of the building and not allowed to ever set foot on any Nuance property again.
No response from Andrew and Springer! How odd
"Going to buy out price, finally!"
Anyone know how the large number of subsidiaries Nuance has affects their balance sheet and/or the stock price? I was shocked today when I learned how many subsidiaries are involved.
Today is supposed to be the Shareholder vote to approve the merger - there is no info on this on their Investor Relations site - does anyone know when that is ?
Grid lock for 4 more years regardless of who wins. Good for the market good for nuan.
"#1 NUAN continues to be an Institutional play. (90% w/insiders). These folk's will decide how to proceed and do what they can to max their value over time with no particular rush. This tech continues to evolve at an increasing pace. IBM, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL and many others fighting for AI, Cloud, etc. NUAN has the Advanced Tech in this space, led by IBM that will become the Champ in the end. IBM is the leader in Analytics, Predictability, Security, rather than the ""response to commands"" application that is a pure commodity. NUAN proprietary property is where its value lies when the monetization occurs. The IBM/NUAN marriage, if it exists like we think, will be dominant, hopefully in my lifetime!!!"
I am wrong about the deal closing in September! The deal is closing in December and that is a given. No conjecture. Sorry for the misinformation!
"What a difference a seasoned and committed management can make - long-awaited and deserved by shareholders. I thought the CC and quarter were excellent, and the team obviously has some strategic plans in the works that should yield further benefit. I expect to see upgrades going forward ... shareholder since the early Scansoft days."

Thank you ohh thank you Mr Benjamin! As I keep saying, a breath of fresh air!"
"Ok, I’m a little slow. No, take that back, as I’m really slow for not selling during the apple hype years ago. So, how do we calculate what a share is worth today combined with CRNC? Yes, Kathleen addressed this a few weeks back but how do we calculate this?"
Interesting?????
The number of NUANCE long hedge funds positions increased at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. There were 60 hedge funds that hold a position in NUAN compared to 45 funds in the third quarter. Time to buy. Long way to go.
what do you guys think of Diana Nole? Interested in NUAN for the healthcare aspect. Thanks
pretty quiet.......birds chirping or something is aflutter?
"As a NUAN shareholder, will I get MSFT stock or cash payment?"
High volume push at the close. Games continue.

"Will current Nuance shareholders have the option to exchange their shares for Microsoft shares? Having the option at least could be beneficial for tax management purposes, if so desired. Thank you."
Just got the proxy voting. Shareowner meeting and vote to approve will be Aug 25th.
Anyone give what would likely be a timeline for closing the deal?
OMG - 2 Powerfull press releases - just b4 AM. Are we invested in a winner? This is so unlike what NUAN has ever done in the past. NOT!!!!
Looks somewhat manipulated. How can it stay on $53 for so long?
I hope HAVA...aka Nina Coach can figure out a way to get rid of RR...aka Richey Rich!
"Not sure why this is down so much the past few days but I'm going nowhere. Two possibilities I see are the company smashing earnings expectations and forecasts or missing earnings expectations and forecasts. In the first case, stockholders may reject the deal feeling the company is worth more and in the second, Microsoft isn't walking on the deal anyway so $56 is a guarantee."
Great buying opportunity here!
We just made a recent intraday high and closed at recent high. The chart is looking good!

I think I will stick with Nuance. I most certainly like the new atmosphere that Mark has brought to Nuan. I am willing to give him a chance and see what happens next. been here forever
TO my friend Joe (Blaire)...NUAN made him rich long ago. I can still hear him jump for joy as it climbed daily. Hed call me up and say buy some. You would be burning my phone up these last few days if you were still here. Very happy for your family.Joe you are missed.

"Nationally recognized, Johnson Fistel is investigating whether the proposed deal represents adequate consideration, especially given analysts' projections for future earnings and revenue growth; also, one Wall Street analyst has a $65.00 price target on the stock."
"Any Arb specialists here ?Seems like the Gap is $3, so back of the envelope the market thinks there is a 10% probability the deal wont go through. Looking at some options trades, its also about a 10-15% probability. What's the proper way to read the markets expectation of the deal closing? Personally I think the probability is much less than 10%."

We expect our full year EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.77. This guidance range assumes a full year diluted share count of 313 million shares, which I would remind investors is impacted by our stock price currently trading above the conversion price of our outstanding convertible notes....we're raising our mid-term CAGR for total Nuance revenue to be 6% to 11% up from our previous guide of 3% to 6%."
Jan 2023 $45 calls for $9... stand to make $2 per contract... And the option was almost $10 PRIOR to the buyout .. all the time value
Nuance is a leader in voice biometrics. Voice biometrics (voice recognition) may well revolutionize security on cell phones and this new ability to safely use your phone will have profound market advantages for the finance and medical companies adopting this technology. Microsoft is getting a bargain.
This time “ walked away “ from the screen a day before earnings only to return now. Solid cash flow. Benjamin is a breath of fresh air! Hip hip chin chin!
"Why is JUAN stock below buyout price. 1. This is typical behavior of many companies who are acquired with several quarter/months before the deal is closed. See WORK2. The buyout price $56 was below the average target $60, so Long term holders were looking to exit $60+. With the ceiling now at $56, some don’t see it worthwhile to hold 6-8 months for another $3-$4.3. Yes, there’s the time value of money or they see better opportunities than to have the money tied up for just $3. While others see an easy 6-7% gain (vs money in a bank) other see paltry gains vs trading in Nvidia or Microstrategy or other stocks with large moves. 4. I was a former employee from a division NUAN sold off "
"Unfortunately, the arb play is just not very juicy anymore. Was able to sell some Jan 2023 75C for $0.25 but it's just not as exciting selling a contract with max profit of $25."
what did i say!!!!!!!!rocket stock
"did anyone here own Nuance when it was Speechworks?I did back in 1999 right after it IPO'd.back then it was trading in the $40-$90 range, in the tech bubble.if I still held, I dont think I would be too happy with this buy-out premium."
"Hey Onyx, Useless here from the ""waaaay past"". Still hanging on to my paltry 36K+ shares waiting for the ""Amazon"", NFLX, pop!!! The news here for me is the Beaudoin return. He may be tasked with recasting the Company including selling off parts in various groupings, then even the whole deal goes somewhere, even a VC outfit!! As for the 15 years + I've been around, the Book has been pretty stabile for a long time since the days of $2.50-$4.00 when I got tricked into NUAN (SSFT). However, the value is locked up in Patents, IP, etc. Scale will unlock all this. Is it best to Recapitalize Internally of parse out the Assets to maximize value. Remember if Ricci is a short termer he will likely do whatever is necessary to maximize his end game, and maybe even reward some of his long time ""followers"". (Wishful Thinking)? I'll stop back when it blow's through 30!!!Be Well!!!"
"This wants to go down. Looks like we’re going to test the 01/27 lows in the $42’s. Last earnings report no catalyst, stagnant money until May?"
"House of cards I'm afraid! Here come the lawsuits, one after the other."
Per Schwab News: 3 Directors out as of June 30. Might be a GREAT start to cleaning house.
Hopefully another company (or two) will jump in with more favorable offers. I'd be pleased with an offer at $70 or more.
Wedbush maintains Outperform and raises PT to $27
My novice technical charting expertise hopes NUAN can close over $45.50 signaling a new up leg after going sideways and building a base. Next stop if this pans out looks like a straight shot to $50. Obvious key is to hold $40 otherwise a potential slide to $35. Hip hip chin chin fellow longs!
"Tech and markets up again and Nuance smelling like rotten fish! I get the feeling Ricci is putting the fix into the future structure of Nuance while having one foot out the door. Where are the activist investors? Oh ya, there are none except a few 1% stakeholders! Lotta good their demand letters did."
"Some thoughts on the current situation:1. Pre-announcement - the only reason I can think they may have done this was to 'woo' a potential CEO candidate they were either in negotiations or close to negotiations with... they didn't do it and the strategy was unsuccessful.2. The new CEO - underwhelming and surprising it took them over a year to land him. He could not have been their top choice. The timing (week and a half before the 1+ yr deadline) coupled with the lack of overlap tells me they mismanaged the selection process.3. There are only two things that make this stock increase - significant and consistent topline growth coupled with no Ricci landmines... somewhat laughable expectations since they haven't been able to achieve either for the past 5 yrs.Unfortunately, I've been a sucker on this one for over 5 years. The next 3 earnings releases will say a great deal about the position of the company. Thought they would have been better able to leverage their near monopoly in healthcare at ~50% of rev."
"New anti trust laws, new ftc head? Curious on opinions.This got approval based on current laws not the bills the house just passed, also new ftchead is not a fan of tech getting larger!Not sure how any merger arb makes sense if we don't know what the laws are going to be, but in any case it looks like its going to be tough to get any done if you look at those 5 bills!"
I fell for these GlobeNeswire PR's for years. I read them now and just laugh!
"Headline...NVDA and GE in partnership to expand AI in healthcare! Hey, I thought Nuance had a moat around this market too!"
"Do we reach 17 today -- 19 by end of March? I say - we probably will. Reasoning: With the imminent day of reckoning of our DEAR friend RR - the BOD, cronies, major shareholders that have benefited SOOO much from the effective and efficient CEO of RR, will as a favor to our POOR underpaid CEO run the price up so that the last vesting of RR shares that WILL be awarded our valiant leader for his GREAT job of leading this Co (to the toilet) will be at the highest and best price. Long live the Emperor as some on this board proclaim!"
POS
"Nuance investors, would you favor a take over of Nuance by Apple?Vote with Thumbs Up or Down."
"A ""preliminary proxy statement"" has been posted today on Nuance's Investor site: https://investors.nuance.com/sec-filings"
so if i buy now i can make $2.20 a share a purchase of 53.70 is that correct?
Thank you Bloomberg for bringing us all together again
"Paul,Thank you for all that you have done for share holders.https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/insider/RICCI%20PAUL"
What is going on - another new BOD member - Healthcare.
BOOGIE OOGIE OOOOOOGGGGGIEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! Another beautiful day in the burbs!!!! Haven’t found how many if at all shares of CRNC NUAN still owners. I couldn’t find anything in the annual report.
"Did I hear right? Cash transaction, not MSFT stock for NUAN? My tax bill is going to be a lot bigger than I thought this year...."
MSFT is buying cheap NUAN .The average analyst price target is $58.00. NUAN should not sell itself for less than $60.00. The potential for this company is huge. No need to be bought a a fire price.
"May the forces of the EMPEROR not be with us Thursday! Imaging money, Automotive update, and the lack of growth on the table."
Another solid quarter and a beat by 2 cents. Will delve into the call later but on the surface it’s what I was expecting.
"I have done my daily random chart comparison & once again any random stock is better than Nuance. Consider CROCs, lacking 'AI' it fashioned itself into a rubber made success going from 8-60+ in 2020 leaving Nuan in the dust of technological mumbo without the real jumbo of any measure. And doing it again today trending and belonging to the most active. Such a dream scene. You go crocs!"
What is Nuan short interest?The best thing about nuance is that it gets recognized as a company that didn't need to be shorted because it was simply priced right. Managed to not perform. The board of directors worked for who? The core of Nuance growth and profitability has been spun off. It's simply a ship that has risen with the tide kinda like inflation.
"Sad ending to an ""it"", stock of the late nineties, speech recognition , the next new thing. It sure didn't live up to the hype."
"recession proof stock, all hospitals use Nuance, Google might buyout,"
pre earnings run up that we have seen for years! I'm not buying it this time and staying OUT!
"Nuance, which helped develop Apple Inc.’s Siri voice-activated software, is under pressure from asset manager Neuberger Berman Group to remove Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul Ricci. The sometimes activist investor’s proposals in a December letter included appointing a new independent interim chairman and replacing the chairman of its governance committee. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who had previously targeted the company, sold his stake in it last year.Also in December, Ivory Investment Management, which said it owned 1.6 percent stake in Nuance, urged the company to quickly sever ties with Ricci and name a successor. On Monday, Fairpointe Capital, according to Reuters, expressed concerns over Nuance’s board and CEO succession."
I jumped on the lawsuit. This is BS. This company is worth way more than $56 a share. Should be valued at at least $86. The program is used by 77% of hospitals and it's still in its early stages. Voting no also
Does anyone know when the NUAN shareowners vote on the merger?(interesting $515M penalty if they vote No :) -that's voter intimidation)
"Re. Amazon, Google or Facebook stepping in with another offer: Don't overlook that MSFT is a large NUAN partner. If NUAN leaves MSFT at the altar, that partnership would likely go south, reducing NUAN revenue and making them less attractive."
Yo Dean explain to me your option strategy in English. I’m a little slow!!!!!!
"$3.25 free money. Buy at will as markets may roll over, but this is guaranteed..."
Any price guess? I own this through SVCTF fund which has small stake as of Q4 filing.
"Could come down to 45.50. 20 day moving average? Earnings Feb 8th. Like I’ve said, what do I know!!! Nothing!"
"Nice rally off the early lows. Will the gains hold, or will the price start wilting like a leaky balloon all the way back down to test the lows?"
"Target prices raised by major firms to 18 up to 23. The co bought back a ton of stock in the high 13’s. Nice cash flow and more transparency from Benjamin over the Emperor. Oh, and yes oh yes the “ pig “ effect is in play."
"CRNC spinoff gives Nuance a adjusted SP of 23.84 at yesterday's closing price. Good but not great considering in 2007 I believe the SP was still trending up and in the low 20's? but since than it's been up and down and hasn't really done much. All in all Nuance has not been a good buy and hold investment. I always thought that management did enough to keep the lights on and to enrich themselves. Why else would paul ricci have been proud to have stated that he took the SP to $16 after 16 years. I own no NVDA unfortunately, but follow it because of AMD. NVDA was recently up more in one day than what ricci accomplished in 16 years. Years ago I read an article from an investor who stated that the NASDAQ was for trading and the NYSE was for investing. Nuance reinforces his opinion."
With the market overbought this is my safe place for the next few months. I'LL TAKE 6% RISK FREE ANY TIME but especially now! $245k in here and more if it goes below $53 which I doubt seriously. Thums up to agree
"As usual, wrong on all levels! I"
"Being an ""Innovation Awards Nomimee"". Does wonders for you bottom line! Congrats to RR for your innovations! You're the best."
"Underwhelming selection. But then again, that's the M.O. for Nuance leadership."
When does it close?
Benzinga reports Elliot & Assoc. has taken an interest in NUAN. Likely to push to maximize value. Works for me!
Where does Nuance's automotive division go??? Ford and Baidu???? BMW and Nuance????
"Earnings will now be a non-event given the preannouncement. I ask again...why did you preannounce????? Companies whose stock has doubled, tripled, quadrupled, they might, on rare occasions do it. Ricci seems to be buying time ?????"
"Billy, I will be going to the AM again this year only this time I'll bet they deny my access! if Nuance stock performance was in line with most tech stocks, I would never complain but this is way out of line and has been since 2001."
Sad POS!
clearly state that they are making the automotive business a separate business line!
Cerence and Nuance now trading separately but very little fanfare. Not even mentioned once on CNBC for example. Is anyone following this?
So Mr. Benjamin takes his seat in the well worn thrown of Sir Paul Richy Richer on Monday. His first order of business is to figure how to deal with a debt ridden company that the dip #$%$ handed to him.
"Today it's ""buy now make guaranteed 7-8%. Tomorrow will be ""buy now make 10-15%"". By Friday will be ""buy now make 15-20%"" LMFAO I have no doubt that this will eventually get back to 53+, just not this week or until MSFT process complete (if it goes through)."
Down over 5% and lower than before ER/CC! Bring on the Form 4's RR needs new shoes
so does today's news mean buyout will close sooner than expected like by mid-september?
Simply doing a little house keeping on this board before the doors are locked for the final time. Everyone from the past has stopped posting and this wild ride is coming to a close. Hip hip chin chin!
I have had this stock for 4 years and have made zero profit. I am about ready to sell and move on to any company who has a good CEO and actually makes money.
"The anguish and pain of countless underwhelming conference calls and earnings reports are becoming a distant memory. The 1 that tops them all is when Ricci announced a miss right after mid night. There were so many with mixed messages and disappointing numbers to the low side of guidance that eventually I became somewhat immune. As stated before, I was a fool and yes should of sold years ago but held on. Maybe I justified holding because my cost basis was close to 3. Oh, those 3, 4, and 5 point drops on huge volume had me hitting the bottle more than normal. The Emperor and most of the former Board Members were simply too greedy. Billy Janeway, the mastermind with Ricci on implementing the me 1st Form 4 Machine that enriched themselves to high heaven before the other shareholders are now gone. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a believer in capitalism and making money, it’s just that these 2 operated Nuance imo as an almost “ criminal “ enterprise. Enough said. Forgive the rant. It’s great therapy for me. Thanks to Benjamin and his staff. As again stated before, what a breath of fresh air!"
"On no, Zack is recommending a short?Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN): Domiciled in Massachusetts, Nuance provides conversational and cognitive artificial intelligence innovations. The consensus mark for 2021 earnings per share has moved 13% south over the past 60 days. The firm carries a Zacks Rank #5 and has a VGM Score of D, at present."

Hey...over $14!
Interesting activity today. Maybe something is brewing the corner office?
"Well with our new independent board of directors and especially the independent chairman of the board, Nuance might have a great chance of success. Thanks to Mr B"
"Looks like bad earnings ahead, Nuance products are for voice dictation which has nothing to do with cloud or remote work categories. Quite the opposite, it should lost big enterprise deals from corporate upgrade cancellations, the sales and EPS numbers are likely to miss target."
"Paul Ricci to ""retire"" on or B4 3/31/2018 - BOD to name new CEO on or B4 3/31/2018.Above is what was announced - do you believe above will actually happen?My guess nothing will be announced until 3/31.I will hold my 1000 shares till sometime after 3/31. I hope Pigs dream of special dividend & $22 total is correct. If not - I will be out of here either way. With the recent vote for BOD - obviously the shareholder community does NOT like the direction that this BOD has taken this Co."
a correction is needed for a healthy nuance market
