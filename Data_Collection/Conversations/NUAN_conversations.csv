"Nuance just needs to be acquired. Management is good about feeding their own pockets, but not feeding the pockets of their investors."
Today is supposed to be the Shareholder vote to approve the merger - there is no info on this on their Investor Relations site - does anyone know when that is ?
I don't know why the gap is not narrowing more - there are often relatively big moves at the end of the day? just sold a few more OOTM puts -mainly to keep my margin requirements in check :)
"Not sure why this is down so much the past few days but I'm going nowhere. Two possibilities I see are the company smashing earnings expectations and forecasts or missing earnings expectations and forecasts. In the first case, stockholders may reject the deal feeling the company is worth more and in the second, Microsoft isn't walking on the deal anyway so $56 is a guarantee."
Mark B's turnaround plan seems to be working! You have to give him Kudos.
"Beware of November 28. It will tell of Nuance's fate. The more good news articles that come out as we wait, the lower the earnings will be at that date."
$NUAN shareholders accepted the merger proposal on 6/15 https://www.marketscreener.com/amp/quote/stock/NUANCE-COMMUNICATIONS-IN-10945/news/NUANCE-COMMUNICATIONS-INC-nbsp-Submission-of-Matters-to-a-Vote-of-Security-Holders-form-8-K-35625398/
"Why is $53? When at SEC they said that. What is the purchase price?Nuance is being acquired by Microsoft for $56 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance’s net debt."
"Ok, I’m a little slow. No, take that back, as I’m really slow for not selling during the apple hype years ago. So, how do we calculate what a share is worth today combined with CRNC? Yes, Kathleen addressed this a few weeks back but how do we calculate this?"
"Solid quarter with a better balance sheet than ever before. Oh yes and as I've said before, Benjamin is a breath of fresh air! Seems like very few from the past are still here so guess I'll be talking to myself going forward. 10,420 shares left and I'll continue to hold."
It would make sense for Microsoft to acquire Nuance to get a toehold in healthcare. Is that driving Nuance shares lately?
What’s up...Some consolidation before the next leg up? Wall Street doesn’t like Benjamin’s joining PTC? Stiefel upgrade to $45 which was a downgrade from current price?
"Four (4) Law Firms investigating Nuance. Lifshitz Law Firm, P.C. Announces Investigation, Halper Sadeh LLP Continues to Investigate, Monteverde & Associates PC Announces an Investigation of Nuance, Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC InvestigatesThey seeking big pay day? Seeking to block sale ?"
"Ricci kept paying himself 15 million per year while he kept overpaying for start up companies that never paid off. Now Amazon and Google have made Nuances speech recognition seem outdated. You can't compete with companies that are worth nearly 1 trillion dollars, they will eat you alive. ''King of Speech'' Is crowned to Amazon Alexa, not Nuance. They also paid Benjamin 14.7 million only after being on the job for 6 months. These guys really burnt long shareholders."
With the market overbought this is my safe place for the next few months. I'LL TAKE 6% RISK FREE ANY TIME but especially now! $245k in here and more if it goes below $53 which I doubt seriously. Thums up to agree
Does anyone know when MSFT will take over NUAN ???...
"Fairpointe, a Chicago-based investment management firm with $5.3 billion under management, is seeking clarity on when Ricci will depart and who will replace him, Fairpointe portfolio manager Marie Lorden said in an interview.Fairpointe, which owns a 1.77 percent stake in Nuance, has also sent a private letter to the company's board in recent weeks about the issue, Lorden added.Burlington, Massachusetts-based Nuance did not respond to requests for comment."
"I don't know what happened to my comment but I still don't know why this hasn't gotten closer to the $56 cash buyout price. It was at $55.10 when I wrote my comment that disappeared but now at $55.04 you are guaranteed a $.96 return on this in the 1-3 months as the deal is closing by December 31st. Not a windfall but that's still a 1.96% return in at most a 90 day window. That represents at least a 7% annualized return. Microsoft has cash so don't worry about the deal falling through and that sure beats what you can get on money market or worse, bond funds right now."
"1st time ever I heard a Nuance CEO congratulate the employees for a job well done during a conference call! Healthcare cloud revs up yr over yr 20+, Dragon strong 20+ growth qtr over qtr, enterprise firing on solid cylinders and DAX is really providing great results. Interesting to Note, Dan Ive’s asked about the relationship with MSFT to which Bob Dahdah said, “ we just continue to be super pleased and grateful that we have the opportunity to work as closely with them, as we do, I think, we think about the market in similar ways...” Hey this confirms the chatter I’ve been hearing for awhile! It’s not far fetched that the relationship with Microsoft could end up being a game changer event!!! Yep, all systems go!!! Oh and once again, The Chief Kahuna, Benjamin, congratulating the employees for a job well done! What a concept!"
Minimum guaranteed 7-8% upside based on $56 agreed upon cash purchase. What's there to think about?
Solid quarter once again! Benjamin is simply a breath of fresh air! They remain focused on their core business. I’m sticking!
20/20 hindsight tells me I should have gotten this at $0.54.
"NEW YORK, Dec. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Purcell Julie & Lefkowitz LLP, a class action law firm dedicated to representing shareholders nationwide, is investigating a potential breach of fiduciary duty claim involving the board of directors of Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN)."
Something is in the air. Maybe a MSFT stock exchange????
"On no, Zack is recommending a short?Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN): Domiciled in Massachusetts, Nuance provides conversational and cognitive artificial intelligence innovations. The consensus mark for 2021 earnings per share has moved 13% south over the past 60 days. The firm carries a Zacks Rank #5 and has a VGM Score of D, at present."
why would a stock with $56 cash offer drop 3 points?
We need a new CEO and a DEF 14A
"OK...""Company is moving forward with establishing it's automotive business as a separate reportable segment and business line"" ???????"
"Why is JUAN stock below buyout price. 1. This is typical behavior of many companies who are acquired with several quarter/months before the deal is closed. See WORK2. The buyout price $56 was below the average target $60, so Long term holders were looking to exit $60+. With the ceiling now at $56, some don’t see it worthwhile to hold 6-8 months for another $3-$4.3. Yes, there’s the time value of money or they see better opportunities than to have the money tied up for just $3. While others see an easy 6-7% gain (vs money in a bank) other see paltry gains vs trading in Nvidia or Microstrategy or other stocks with large moves. 4. I was a former employee from a division NUAN sold off "
Bought more. I will vote against the merger. I think MSFT is undervaluing Nuance. I am hoping another suitor will offer $65 or more.
"As a NUAN shareholder, will I get MSFT stock or cash payment?"
does anyone know what's going to happen after the merge?
Been in nuance since caere days. Something I have noticed over the years is that left behind stocks seem to rally just before a market fall because so called investors are looking for laggards. Just an observation as I stated. Maybe this time it's different?
WOW Now that was impressive quarter. Are we on the right track or what?Market likes it also.
"Andrews & Springer LLC Is Investigating Nuance Communications, Inc. For Potential Breaches of Fiduciary Duty and Securities Violations"
Why not a deal structured where Nuance shareholders receive MSFT stock in exchange for their Nuan shares ... seems the better option re: capital gains. What’s the advantage to all cash deal?
Nuance holds no shares of CRNC after reading all the spinoff legal jargon. Obviously Nuance employees might as stock holders before the spinoff. I also couldn’t find anything on stock options granting Nuance Management after the spin off warrants or Cerence shares so I’m assuming it’s a no.
"Which does the street value more...organic growth or CAGR? Does anyone understand the share count increase and implications? For fiscal year '21, we expect total revenue in the range of $1.327 billion to $1.367 billion implying organic growth of 3% to 7% year-over-year. We expect our full year EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.77. This guidance range assumes a full year diluted share count of 313 million shares, which I would remind investors is impacted by our stock price currently trading above the conversion price of our outstanding convertible notes....we're raising our mid-term CAGR for total Nuance revenue to be 6% to 11% up from our previous guide of 3% to 6%."
I sold this a month or so ago and just checked the price again - what’s the story with the price? I figured it’d gradually head to the $56 buyout price and it was headed there until the last few days. Anyone??
"Any Arb specialists here ?Seems like the Gap is $3, so back of the envelope the market thinks there is a 10% probability the deal wont go through. Looking at some options trades, its also about a 10-15% probability. What's the proper way to read the markets expectation of the deal closing? Personally I think the probability is much less than 10%."
