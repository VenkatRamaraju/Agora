"New to investing in 2021. I have 20,000$.Is it good to buy 2000$ worth of each following company:DIS, HLT, WMT, ALL, HCA, ALK, QRVO, VALE, O, NEE. I don’t want to put all 20,000 in 1 single stock. But does it make sense to buy 1000$ worth of each above (10 total) companies"
"NEE is headed back down to under $70, save your cash."
Straight up for August....time to short XLU! NEE is 17% of XLU......NEE all time high was around $87....Over bought and resistance ahead!
"Added some NEE yesterday. It looks expensive but when I compare it to other renewable players, it looks cheap"
NEE Dropping on heavy volume. I wonder if someone knows something adverse about the quarterly report to be released next Wednesday?
"A utility stock trading at 37 times earnings; what could go wrong? It could trade at 20 times, that's what. Still, the story is compelling for long, long term buyers, such as myself and my clients who think in terms of 2 to 4 years. Mark J. Seski, CIO, Harvest Portfolio Management."
"NEE is at all time highest PE ratio and lowest all time yield. Lots to like about the company, but not those two numbers... Is anyone even paying their bills yet? I think rent forbearance will be extended due to delta outbreak..welcome to the new welfare state."
Added at $72.70. NEE is now my largest holding!
Nee appreciates like a bank stock but drops like a growth stock. SMH
just bought 100 shares 79.09 won't stay below 80 for long
"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
"I am guessing this is a bit of wanting to not miss out and utility companies are never quite as sexy. Possible it also represents a small inflation fear, obviously utility companies are making big investments and if rates do rise it makes projects more expensive. I certainly wouldn't be selling"
"I included BEP and NEE as part of my election trade. BEP is crushing NEE and I'm wondering if that is a reflection of it having more exposure or more well known as a ""green"" play. Anyone have any thoughts as to why this is crushing my Next Era Energy? Been thinking of dumping NEE but frankly that looks fantastic also. So hard not to be caught up in the instant gratification trade. These are both in retirement accounts BTW."
"This is a good stock to SHORT or buy PUT'sThey sell power to much of Florida and cannot disconnect service for non pay.YES, they are regulated utility and can recoup the losses with rate hikes, but the cash on hand will evaporate in the near term."
"Bought the dip today, great company at a low price."
what is the difference between Southern company and NEE? why is SO stock so low compared to NEE ? both seemed to be good utilities
"Can someone explain the drop in revenue and earnings last quarter? I don't own the stock, but was thinking of investing. Thanks."
4:1 stock split.
Very weird action with TLT up 4+ points and NEE closing on the lows...very negative candle today
last 3 years eps down yet the irrational exurburance is 70 pe on a utility come on people this has got major govt b.s. all over it...avoid
"Earnings should be good as Zacks is predicting a beat, as they have for previous 3 quarters. In addition, fully expecting a Divi increase as they have every year for the last 20. This company is doing it right by the planet and right by the investors as all of it continues to grow. Love the Hydrogen move as well. They think 10 years ahead and that’s how we got here."

NEE is going to be next Tesla within few years. Energy demand is increasing rapidly with increasing electric vehicles and industries. Renewable energy is the only option to fulfill this need.
buying NEE @75 now in 5 years will sound cheap. This will double in 5 years. expect 20% per year growth.
was a first time investor this past year and loaded up on NEE but got impatient because it was just going sideways / in the red since initial purchase... I feel dumb now :{ Might start a position again.
"Just hit the trend line since July, time to bounce higher to $90"
"NEE is an excellent company that has a very rich history. Since 1985, NEE has only had 5 years where it ended lower than it began for the year. Out of 35 years of history, NEE keeps delivering. If you remember, during Hurricane Irma, NEE actually was able to both maintain their dividend and keep rates the same for customers due to the federal tax savings they received. There's a lot of chatter about the most recent option that happened with NEE. If you read the plan, ""Each stock purchase contract will require the holder to purchase NextEra Energy common stock for cash, based on a per-share price range of $295.70 to $369.63."" This is a cash infusion option which will help NEE to invest in other initiative as those options are exercised. It's forward-looking and will ultimately help us shareholders in the long-run. NEE is not a company that you can put money into and get rich quick. There is not a ton of volatility with this stock which means that it remains pretty stable on a day-to-day basis. Any drop with this stock is an opportunity to add more. If you purchased NEE at any point since 2009, you've made money. Both with dividends and with share price appreciation. Every day will not be green, but over the next few weeks/months, I expect the uptrend to continue. I added more at this level.Good luck to all."
While everyone was watching a possible Duke buy out NEE was buying Gridliance from Blackstone for $660M plus assuming their debt. Below is the reason i copied from the news release:One of the biggest obstacles hindering renewable energy growth is building enough transmission infrastructure to connect all this power to the grid. It's a problem the company intends on solving by growing its transmission business. It recently took another step in that direction by acquiring GridLiance.
I don't understand why NEE would want to buy DUK. Why shift from renewable to coal? Can anyone clarify this to me please
"If you look at historical share price growth in last 4 years or so, it has averaged well over 20% growth per year. At current share price we are only around 15% in last year. I believe NEE is selling cheap right now. It’s now my largest holding."
they are diluting the stock by selling equity units. right?so does it mean the stock will drop/reduce in value?
Let the Sun Shine! 
"UNO BEACH, Fla., Feb. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today declared a regular quarterly common stock dividend of $1.40 per share, up 12% versus the prior-year comparable quarterly dividend. This increase is consistent with the plan announced in 2018 of targeting 12% to 14% annual growth in dividends per share through at least 2020, off a 2017 base. The dividend is payable on March 16, 2020, to shareholders of record on Feb. 28, 2020."
How can Zacks rank NEE as a strong buy one day and then a strong sell the next? They are a joke. Long NEE.
"Anybody know why this is up so much today (up 4% today) I have owned NEE for more than 20 years, long and strong with 960 shares"
To anyone here who has owned this stock for a long time (lets say 10-15 years or longer) Do you think its too late to buy it now for price appreciation in the next decade?
"I feel really safe having 25 percent of my portfolio here, a close second holding for me. No worries about the broad market as utilities are a safe haven and if the market does roll over I think we get a lot of new cash coming into this ticker. The best part is it is safe from even the far left, which is hard to find a stock that will perform well no matter what. The big banks know the deal and are getting into this big time. Biggest producer of renewable energy and a safe haven with an always increasing dividend, I can't find anything to not like about parking my money here for the long term."
The PE ratio for many many years was between 10 and 20 as the fundamentals and stock price both did well. In the past 12 months the PE has ballooned quite a lot. Should i wait for PE to come back to earth before buying?
"No worries here everyone.If you are long holding the stock with dividend reinvest, you're fine. You're picking up cheaper shares along the way. I've learned it takes some time after stock splits for things to rebalance and settle.Look at Visa and Apple. Visa split 4-1 a while back and was hanging about their pre-split for a stretch of time, prior to moving forward. Similar to Apple, which split 4-1 not too long ago. This is not a day trade or swing trade stock, and we are set for the future.All is good here.Good luck."
Anyone knows why NEE dropped 2.8 % on Friday?
Bought back in @ $78.45. Easy 10% return by Xmas with more next year as supply chain issues resolve.
"CFRA analyst Sam Stovall downgraded his view of the S&P 500 utilities subsector to underweight from market weight on Monday, after a run up over several months sparked by investor uncertainty and the hunt for yield. ""The sector currently trades at a 37% premium to its average P/E on next-12-month (NTM) EPS estimates since 2000,"" Stovall wrote in a note to clients. ""In addition, it currently trades at a 13% premium to the S&P 500's NTM average P/E versus its normal 7% discount."" The group also has a lower-than-average number of constituents with a favorable rating, he wrote, while technically, its relative strength has started to deteriorate versus the overall index."
"buying in steps, at the moment I have 18 shares. Planning to add on dips next months and hold forever"
NEE is one of the best stocks and safest stock out of all the large cap stocks out there.
$NEE announced yesterday that they expanded the size of their property around the Moss Mine. - Increased the size from about 47 sq km to almost 169 sq km- Property-scale hyperspectral alteration mineral maps are now being used with their historical database to better prioritize exploration targets - Oatman district has historical production over 2M ounce's of gold
i read a recent article from 10 days ago that describes this company's stock as having a dividend yield of 3.5%......then look at the summary stats presented by Yahoo and they say the div. yield is 1.98%. Who is correct?
"Any info on renewable revenues falling 58%, nearly 1 billion dollars. Management has not been forth coming with an expanation. Big drop for a leading renewable energy company."
Biden win will make this stock rocket
If i could only buy 1 stock that is the safest for a decade it would be a toss up between NEE and AMZN. Thats it.
anyone who invest in NEE now will see their investment double twice in the next decade. NEE is the powerhouse in South USA and has grown to be the best Energy company. It has a 30 year growth chart better than 95 percent of every company that existed. This is a great investment for those who can buy and wait with a portion of their portfolio.
"NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is another shining star in the renewable world. NextEra is the world’s leading producer of wind and solar energy, so it’s no surprise that it has received some love from the ‘millennial dollar.’Other solar stocks up huge while NEE seriously lags behind...."
NEE beat earnings estimates and is growing faster than expected
don't get me wrong. I love NEE. the EPS is only is only 8.37$. The stock can't be tradng at 32 times. How can a utility stock trade like this? If it is a technology stock I can understand because they have lot of moat. when the price correction happens it might go to 124$ (15 times multiple).Is there anything that I am missing?
I've owned NEE since its symbol was FPL many years ago.. It's a long tern hold growth stock. It's a well run company and will continue to grow. I'm going to watch for buying opportunities on price drops. Another point down and I'll probably add to my position.
Wonderful news. Means Nee has extra cash and is confident to pay off 2 debentures Early. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-arm-redeem-950m-notes-115011004.html
"A Great write up flexing both the Northern Vertex story of Moss Mine and Hercules, as well as Doug Hurst's past and current successes. We have the winning combo - top tier projects and top tier management to generate value for us! Certainly worth a read if you are looking for exposure to #gold #silver. $NEE.V offers exposure as a gold producer, but also massive upside in exploration as they expand the resource and deposits at Moss, as well as at Hercules. https://nationalpost.com/sponsored/news-sponsored/canadian-mining-company-unlocking-the-potential-of-western-u-s-gold-properties"
"The minor dilution doesn't seem to be taken too badly and it really shouldn't. Gives them some more cash to expand and tighten up the balance sheet, but also did well to bring this out of overbought territory. This will probably be a very short lived pullback and just brought us to the level we were at Friday and now gives us some room to move up into divi date. I think it was a good move to raise money at the top when it was due for a minor correction anyway. I think this was really well played by management again."
Hopefully get a bounce back up next couple of days. That was quite a big selloff for such a stable company.
Manchin has wiped out clean energy. Get out before it drops to 40.
Utilities seems to be regaining their mojo today after rolling over around oct 24. last 5 days have been basing. maybe we start going up again. NEE up $4+ so far today.
"James Robo received $32,600,000 in total compensation last year. Ridiculous amount, even for a corporation that needs to compete in the market place. Crazy for a utility that is, essentially, a monopoly. He could have received fair compensation, with the balance going to employee salaries, infrastructure, and stock holders. Sorry, but the board is just not doing its job in this regard."
"IMO this is one of the best stocks out there. I have held this stock for a very long time. Just about every month brings a new all time high, and it pays a nice dividend."
On 8/16 the 50 Day MA crossed back over the 200 day MA. A very bullish sign plus it reverses what happened in early June when the 50Day crossed down. Since this stock has been very positive for years you rarely see this action. In general because of the rising price over time their has been a lot of positive space between the averages. The MACD indicator is also very positive. I am not a technical investor but look at some of theses indicators because a lot of pros use them to move money in and out.
"Five years ago, the dividend was around 5%."
NEE Stock is the leader stock for Energy... buying an index for energy is not smart. Just buy the best in the Market and you will always win.
"Sustainable Energy AlternativeNextEra Energy (NEE) is one notable exception. This enterprise is leading the charge in the renewable energy space, and its share price appreciation illustrates this anticipated economic shift towards sustainability. NEE has seen returns of roughly 190% in the past 5 years (nearly doubling the S&P 500) while at the same time yielding a healthy 1.7% dividend. This innovation-driven energy giant has stayed buoyant even amid the pandemic as the world looks towards the future.The future of NextEra Energy is bright, being the largest producer of solar and wind energy, a leader in battery storage, and not to mention maintaining a massive backlog of renewable energy projects. In this indefinite low-interest-rate environment that the Fed has provided the equity markets, NextEra's significant future earnings are now worth more today than ever. The new democratic government wave has created a tailwind of momentum for NEE that should continue its drive through the roaring 20s."
"Surprised NEE is lagging the Dow so badly. I would have expected this to dramatically outperform the market. Oh, well, one thing I have learned is the the market never behaves as you think it should."
Picked up some shares today. Looks like a good time to get in. Living the good life here in Florida 
Sadly in this kind of environment NEE will most likely dive down to 190. Utilities dropped 30% in the financial crisis in 2008 and tech stocks dropped 40 to 50%. Too many people fearing will push market this direction just because of the uncertainty. Of coarse this does not mean the market will not recover 18 months from now but be ready for a very bumpy ride! I am in cash and waiting near earnings report time to get back in when dust settles. Sad to see this all due to panic.
Is a 3/1 split in the near future?

I thought during recession, the utilities should do well. I was under the impression that during recession investors will flock to utilities or REITS. I like NEE now. but trying to undestand how the stock performs during recession since everyone is talking about it."

Where there was farm land and barren land, there is now home and office construction. Where land was producing a zero electric bill, it is now or soon to happen large increases in electric service bills. I haven't mentioned NEE's renewable energy prospects.

"stock is a great buy and just hold , of course it went down a liitle after split always does..but this is the future"
All of these renewable energy stocks are going to take off because they will be the new “oil stocks in their prime.”
This will be the best Energy company for another decade.
"Though this stock seems overvalued and unappreciated/uninterested, this is certainly a long term stock that provides a decent dividend. Seems to me you’ll get some money back via dividends and you’ll watch this stock grow. If you like boring, reliable, and value this stock is for you. If you like fast money or a quick growth then consider something else. This security is definitely for those of us that like to invest and forget. Cheers all!"
NEE is the safest growing stock TSLA is the fastest growing stock NIO is china's fastest growing stockAMZN is the best long term bet What are your thoughts
It’s nice to see their pipeline full of contracts for new renewable projects in wind and solar. If they want to grow as fast as the rest of the clean energy sector they are going to need to start building faster. Has anyone seen any news on how they will accomplish this? I’m bullish on this stock but want to see it perform to its full potential.
This was a great buy-in opportunity....You can’t go wrong with a renewable energy stock in 2021...
"Sorry guys, I was shorting this and XLU, but never wished this type of carnage on you.

NEE earning date coming up 10/21/2020 & the Stock split 4:1 in October 26th...The future is bright for renewable energy.
How sweet it is!
All red in my PF except strong and steady NEE
Gridliance acquisition now complete. Transmission is a big deal. Most green energy is going nowhere unless it can be hooked into the grid otherwise it is stand alone which is not how it will roll out in most places. NEE was smart to jump on this company and will be looking to add more transmission systems and build new ones. Also regulated so more or less guaranteed revenues. They are constantly on the prowl to add good assets. Forget about the day to day moves in the price and look at the big picture.
by spt it will be less than 100.
The 2030 Agenda that the world has signed off aligns very well with renewable energy stocks. But and hold for 10+ years!!!!!

Thank you Mathew. 2022 seems a long way off since this is only the beginning of 2021. This stock has very little conversations and comments for such a highly thought of utility with such a thriving wind power business! Does anyone else out there have any ideas as to why it's tanking now day after day. Is it all about the new president and interest rates? I'd love to hear some other opinions. I'm a long term holder of it and it's the biggest stock by far in my portfolio.

How is NEE valued at $150B when you have VST trading at $10B market cap that has half the revenue and half profit of NEE?

"On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth-quarter earnings were $785 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to $706 million, or $0.36 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2019"
Would love to buy back in the mid sixties...
"I came across Northern Vertex ($NEE) recently as an undervalued gold-silver play with strong potential. $NEE stands out because they are an extremely lean and talented team managing their costs supporting increased production and revenues while reducing overhead. Their most recent update on drill hits reported 64.01 m grading 1.65 g/t Au and 15.39 g/t Ag at their Moss Mine. With more updates forthcoming, these findings demonstrate the significant district-scale potential of their 168km2 land package around the Moss mine.https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-vertex-intersects-64-01-110000199.html"
"New high today! I've seen the comments about retirement- NEE is part of my retirement portfolio, too... I'm in my mid-30s and should be able to retire in my 50s."
"Ex DIV tomorrow, prepare for SP to head lower."
Greatest Energy Company in the game. It’s leadership is top notch. Love this stock
"Wall Street will be looking for positivity from NEE as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect NEE to post earnings of $0.71 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.97%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.69 billion, up 18.98% from the year-ago period."
"$BEPC vs $NEE vs $NEP ? Which is the best long term? Are there others to consider? I own all three, but curious what the board’s opinion."
Stock split 4:1 in October 26th estimate $75/share after split.
Can someone please explain what is an equity unit offering?? I am a toddler in the stock market and I am learning as I go... thanks for your input.
"Can someone explain to me why everyone is so bullish on a slow-growing utility trading at 50x earnings? I know the market hates it, because it is the WORST-performing energy stock since Biden was elected. This might be nice at $30 or $40 a share, but come on, man!"
"NEE 's market is set to soar with its clean energy for the world. They are the largest company in the USA providing solutions for next era of solar, wind, and water energy. People may not know about all the success nor the plans NextEra has, but they are set to make billions of dollars in the years to come."
"awesome close. for those that are asking about whether to buy pre/post split...there is no way anyone can answer that. look at AAPL/TSLA - you buy at the split announcement and it would have been the best opportunity, but NTES you would have been better off post split (there is no norm) price does typically run up after initial announcement, but will also fall off prior to. this split being coupled with earnings being better than expected will likely not see the decline prior to split. one key thing to note if you you are trying to decide whether you want to be in to take advantage of the split - YOU HAVE TO OWN SHARES PRIOR TO OCTOBER 19TH"
Hello; I bought NEE yesterday at price of $300 per share. It went down to $75 today. Can someone tell me if the company will compensate about this.
"If you guys don't see the 5 yr chart of NEE you will never see success. A company to buy and invest in, not just a gamble. A company with a cause! Changing Earth. Global warming, Etc."
Took a position for long term. I like the earnings growth and the dividend growth for a core position
"Hey everyone, I've owned NEE for a while but never visited this board. I thought I would check it out and learn a bit about renewables. My first question: I saw that NEE's partner invested in wind and solar recently, and the farms produce 2.5GW of electricity. Is this per day? Per month? Thanks in advance."
"Best utility by far. Clean, green, efficient, great management, and will reward shareholders in the long term."
"I have long resisted my financial advisors to sell all or most of my NextEra stock. With good reason. The dividends alone would allow me to retire comfortably. When I worked there, I didn’t always agree with senior management. But they ultimately made and continue to make good long term decisions."
Have had FPL/FPL Group/NEE stock since 1987. Retired from FPL in 2019. Enjoyed company match in my 401k for over 30 years. Very much enjoying the ride.
"NEE is the most profitable stock I know. I bought a 1000 shares 25 years ago and this made me a millionaire alone. I have never found a more solid company without risk. NEE is a gem to buy even at this price... It will be here for 20 years providing backup energy to all that live. Air, solar, and wind are among its basic forms of energy. No one can do electricity for cheaper in the country. That's why its number 1 in USA BUY NEE for the long hawl and worry no more if your investment goes up or down!"
"Best combination of growth, dividend and stability on the market."
"does the drop in oil prices, cause a dent for renewable stocks like NEE or tsla?"
"I think NEE is the best company in the ""Energy Sector"" by far."
great earnings
did anyone else see after hours price at 84 up 6.5%?
With climate change stocks like this one are a must long term hold
NEE has a number of gas pipelines in Texas along with a lot of wind. Wonder if issues with gas supplies has been part of reason for downward trajectory.
Have made a boatload of money with this name. Almost a 200 percent gain since my initial inception and now have 348 shares after the stock split last October. Think this still has room to run going forward.
"Anyone concerned with the signatures push to get the electricity supply choice amendment pushed through? I know management spoke about it during the conference call. Right now it is the only real threat to the company. The earnings from NEER are still less than 40% of the total so it would be difficult to make up for the lose of the electricity sales component if the effort succeeds. They would, of course, still be able to operate as a transmission, distribution, and retail company in the state, so I guess it wouldn't be a total bust out. The one provision that I saw was that the utilities would need to divest ownership of the generating assets, selling to an independent operator or putting them into a different subsidiary. Am I following this correct? Could NEE just sell the generating assets to NEER and buy the electricity from that subsidiary for sale through FPL and Gulf?"
NEE's EX DIV is in 3 days on Aug 26th. Stock will hold here or a bit lower heading into ex divvy then fall back. Prepare to BUY BUY BUY.
"Now is over $300, you think with earning report and split, it'll be at least $320?"
Any truth to the rumors about NEE approaching Duke Energy for takeover?
