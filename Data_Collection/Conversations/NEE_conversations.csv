NEE beat earnings estimates and is growing faster than expected
"Hey everyone, I've owned NEE for a while but never visited this board. I thought I would check it out and learn a bit about renewables. My first question: I saw that NEE's partner invested in wind and solar recently, and the farms produce 2.5GW of electricity. Is this per day? Per month? Thanks in advance."

"Wall Street will be looking for positivity from NEE as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect NEE to post earnings of $0.71 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.97%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.69 billion, up 18.98% from the year-ago period."
NEE Dropping on heavy volume. I wonder if someone knows something adverse about the quarterly report to be released next Wednesday?
great earnings
$NEE traded flat pretty much all year. it won't be long that it will run up to $80-$85
Buy hold and repeat stock. Look at long term returns. Fantastic. Buy dips.

"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"

Manchin has wiped out clean energy. Get out before it drops to 40.
Bought back in @ $78.45. Easy 10% return by Xmas with more next year as supply chain issues resolve.
Picked up some shares today. Looks like a good time to get in. Living the good life here in Florida 
"Can someone explain the drop in revenue and earnings last quarter? I don't own the stock, but was thinking of investing. Thanks."
