Avnet is down 6.42% to 28.26
"as typical of Wall Street non-sense, Avnet beat the estimates in the ER yesterday after the bell, and now the stock is down over 4% but if you sell electric cars nobody buys, the stock doubles just for fun."
Avnet is down 5.21% to 25.65
"Investors must think TECD got a bargain from AVT, but which one knows the Tech Solutions situation better, the current owner or the buyer. Buy AVT, now $40.80, and sell short TECD, now $85.30."
Glad to hear Phil Gallagher is back. Hopefully he can be a very positive influence with their supplier community.

"Did Bill Amelio know that on Monday, Delph frantically issued instructions to ship every one of *next month's* orders *this week*, to delay a whopping $250M budget miss? I doubt it. Next month Delph's customers will complain, ship products back, and lose even more confidence in Avnet. And yet again, they will blame it on ""SAP issues"". Delph and his old guard are just kicking the can down the road. Enough is enough. Time to clean house. Yes, Matt- weak management and weak IT infrastucture, but they are in no hurry to fix it. It's a convenient smokescreen for lack of leadership, basic business skills, and yes, ethics. It keeps them employed another quarter."

Layoffs yesterday. Large number. All the competitors are hiring. AVT letting go of older workers.

Today after the close AVT released expected earnings of EPS $1.01 to $1.05 vs .approx. .79 share expected by nine analysts. In addition they beat sales estimates. Sells at ridiculously low price to earnings vs rest of market. 2022 analyst's estimated earnings expected to be $3.62 . Stock is under $40. Book value is $39.58!!!!!! Founded in 1921 it has a good balance sheet and is completely overlooked.
Risk/reward warrants a stake at current levels. Trading at ridiculously low multiples across the board. It won’t be hard for co. to double it’s bottom line into next year as Co has a ridiculous amount of operating leverage. Demand remains high and management just raised guidance.

Not so sure there is much difference between the Avnet story and the Staples story. Two once successful companies in their own sectors which seemingly went adrift.

"AVT stock has dropped $484,664,000 (almost half a billion!!) in value this morning, becausethey came up $10 million short in sales, but profited $ 257,800 more than expected.Have I got this correct?"
"until they get rid of the ""new ceo "" and his group of followers looking to make a quick buck towards retirement . this company would be better off being taken private by someone like blackrock ( berkshire has a similar company in their portfolio ) and put some real business people in charge of this mess . they use a software package that doesnt work and you cant keep a customer happy if all you have been doing for the last year and a half is apologizing while we get the bugs out .that's why they all put their trust in arrow .."

Both Avnet and Arrow are done.
Paul; disappointing to hear. However more reasons why Avnet should be a prime acquisition. Sooner than later!

Watched the CEO discuss Avnet strategy with Susie Gharib of Fortune. It looks like they have invested heavily in servicing start-up companies with technical products. He indicates that assistance bonds customer to the technical services and the ultimately the production supply chain they can provide. It's a bold move to dedicate that much resource to a customer base that currently provides no revenue. If successful it will certainly differentiate Avnet from the traditional distributor.
"Both earnings and guidance look good comparing with estimates. They are not spectacular in absolute numbers, but still good enough to support present share price and, perhaps, moving it higher a bit."

"TI is a big loss, but they already had their own direct distribution system. Makes sense they would cut out Avnet. I do not see many other manufacturers with that capability allowing them to pull out of Avnets distribution. One large exception is Microchip, but their acquisitions will likely take more time to integrate before they can fully switch to their own direct distribution."
Meet revenue expectations and exceeded EPS consensus.... still down 4%. WHY?

"Avnet is slow to the punch. They are the twin of blockbuster video. Until they scale down the company's waste of resources and commit to a bigger and better online sales presence they will not bank anything worth screaming about. Leadership changes killed Avnet's possibilities along with the toxic workplace environment. From Roy Vallee, to Rick Hamada you could see the decline coming. Phil Gallagher should have been Roy Vallee's replacement when he retired."
