"always underperforming. The day after they announce records numbers, we go red two consecutive days. Oh well. That is what this stock does. Stuck to $30/$40 for generations"
Watched the CEO discuss Avnet strategy with Susie Gharib of Fortune. It looks like they have invested heavily in servicing start-up companies with technical products. He indicates that assistance bonds customer to the technical services and the ultimately the production supply chain they can provide. It's a bold move to dedicate that much resource to a customer base that currently provides no revenue. If successful it will certainly differentiate Avnet from the traditional distributor.

"Lost 3% of their sales by losing Maxim. AVT is doing what it does better, Go down. Eventually it will make it up to 44ish but then it is time to run. Nothing new there"
"TI is a big loss, but they already had their own direct distribution system. Makes sense they would cut out Avnet. I do not see many other manufacturers with that capability allowing them to pull out of Avnets distribution. One large exception is Microchip, but their acquisitions will likely take more time to integrate before they can fully switch to their own direct distribution."

"as typical of Wall Street non-sense, Avnet beat the estimates in the ER yesterday after the bell, and now the stock is down over 4% but if you sell electric cars nobody buys, the stock doubles just for fun."
AVT reached a new 52 Week High at 48.70
"Avnet is slow to the punch. They are the twin of blockbuster video. Until they scale down the company's waste of resources and commit to a bigger and better online sales presence they will not bank anything worth screaming about. Leadership changes killed Avnet's possibilities along with the toxic workplace environment. From Roy Vallee, to Rick Hamada you could see the decline coming. Phil Gallagher should have been Roy Vallee's replacement when he retired."
Looking for continued climb to $45+ close
"until they get rid of the ""new ceo "" and his group of followers looking to make a quick buck towards retirement . this company would be better off being taken private by someone like blackrock ( berkshire has a similar company in their portfolio ) and put some real business people in charge of this mess . they use a software package that doesnt work and you cant keep a customer happy if all you have been doing for the last year and a half is apologizing while we get the bugs out .that's why they all put their trust in arrow .."
Today after the close AVT released expected earnings of EPS $1.01 to $1.05 vs .approx. .79 share expected by nine analysts. In addition they beat sales estimates. Sells at ridiculously low price to earnings vs rest of market. 2022 analyst's estimated earnings expected to be $3.62 . Stock is under $40. Book value is $39.58!!!!!! Founded in 1921 it has a good balance sheet and is completely overlooked.
AVT is up 5.15% to 42.25
"Chuck Delph gone at the end of the month. Choosing to leave, what does that say about the future?"
Risk/reward warrants a stake at current levels. Trading at ridiculously low multiples across the board. It won’t be hard for co. to double it’s bottom line into next year as Co has a ridiculous amount of operating leverage. Demand remains high and management just raised guidance.
