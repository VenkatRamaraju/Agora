80's Bond Traders Weekend Supply for Vegas Trip
""""" Good stuff! From one TA I've been listening too sounds like a slight correction to around 38-40k has a high probability before next impulsive wave. CK you mentioned it could dip to around 42-43k. Between the two TAs I'm guessing the dip will finalize over the next 3-5 weeks. But looking like 100k shortly after. If it's anything like the past it'll top off at the end of the year maybe January. Who knows... We'll see... Best of luck everyone."""""""
"Fulls had 27,000 x .375 x 5 = 50,625. So about $10m+.Please correct me if I'm wrong."
Sixteen years go today the White Sox won the World Series. Let's do it again soon!
218 Fridays are nice and all but that 265 Ahha called for would also be good.
"Rallying into the number tomorrow morning, we did that too on the last report.......except this time we're near 52 week highs.......takeaway from it all?"
That was a nice close!

I don't know about you guys but I just LOVE the MACD cross at the 0 line for CME on the Weekly chart. Look for a very good next 4 months or more ahead. If it goes the distance that could equal 40 points or more from here.
"Nice demand for CME stock this morning, opened up with nearly 100,000 shares traded and now we're over 215,000 shares traded and its only a few minutes past 9:00AM CST."
"Our volumes are BACK....and are gonna get more BACK. Ever since Powell, CME has averaged 20.5M a day and this is just for starters. Lets see those rates get back to 1.74 (double top) and if that gets convincingly taken out...look out, we will really be BACK....I'll be back as ""Ahnold"" used to say."
CME 123.....we're almost back to your 218 on a Friday number.
"Ponz, I see a golden cross on the distant horizon...is it a mirage?"
"CME123....wanted to add on the volume which I saw just the other day. Today, CME is showing 23.1M as of 3:06PM CST. Overtime it was common to see the settlement number in the morning show say...23.5M. But, the other day, it showed a much bigger gain something less than 2M and that was odd. So, for the fun, lets see how today's closes out in the morning. Its very possible that the other day was just an anomaly but who knows......"
CME investors will have a good weekend!Go Sky!
ETFs based on Bitcoin Futures ... where do they trade that stuff?
surprised the stock is not running up here.the one time charge that pushed the revenue number down shouldnt be an issue....does the cme always have to act like the cme!!!
"Have we seen this film before.........why does it consistently miss by a measely bit on the revenues. Set up to fail would be the correct thought. Think about it, we made more money on a tad less revenue but if we would have gotten that revenue all we would have done is made more money. However, we know the drill"
CME could hit new 52-week high this week!
Chicago Sky are WNBA champions!
"NVEC announced a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.00 per share of common stock, payable November 30, 2021 to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2021."
White Sox are Playoff Bound!

What do you guys think of the Dem billionaire tax on assets proposal?
"I remember saying adios to whatever that September was, besides really bad, only to welcome in ROCKTOBER.....WOW did October rock unbelievable! Now we go into November and specifically with CME we are up 75% of the time over the past 5 years."
"out123, I listed my favorite O&Gs in your ""sorry, another question"" post 4 days ago. Not sure if you saw it."
"The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to allow the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds to start trading next week, a landmark victory for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought permissions from Wall Street’s top regulator, according to a person familiar with the matter.Specifically, the person said the SEC isn’t likely to block the ETFs proposed by ProShares and Invesco, which are based on futures contracts and were filed under mutual fund guidelines that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks offer investors significant protection."
CME be like
what is there to say at this point....
"Cool name Mathias - Matthew for short - right? And Bachmeier - sports too right? What do you know about the Sox? Not the Sox you wear. No - as to crypto - astrophysicist or nuclear science background? Do you recognize that when traders offer anything for sale, they really want to buy everything. But do tell more about your approach. Mine is the algorithm that lifts the blanket from the hashtag."
VERY NICE stock volume in CME today on the upside nearing 1.8M shares
Read a good outlook on the rate futures. Compared it to the volume increases from 2014-19.

At $500.. Pay for the the last 15 years or so. What's sad. A friend just died. 76 .. Never sold a share. Full membership. I think that was 50000 shares for starters?.
"With this run from 185 for CME, we have now matched the SPY on a total return basis to which we were looking bad just a short time ago. Whoopie"
"Just think how much they would have beat on bottom line if they hadn't ""missed"" on the topClose today? Green ....................."
How is Coin market cap larger than CME?
