"Most tech stocks that are hitting new highs every day are overvalued. However, I have a semiconductor that is hitting a new high today, is not overvalued, has a forward P/E=14, and a dividend yield of 3.74%. If you would like to see the ticker symbol, click 'thumb up'."

"Get mentioned (bullish) on fast$, this happens"
Citigroup RAISES CME price target to 250 from 235. Now thats taking the lead. High price on the street I'm thinking.
"From today’s conference call, relative to the special dividend:“we had about $1.3 billion cash on hand – was comfortable with the $700 million minimum cash balance, we’re comfortable at that – that level. We have $1.3 billion cash on hand. We’ve got $3.9 billion in total debt of which we have $435 million in commercial paper and we’re currently sitting at a 1.2 times debt to EBITDA as we paid down about $0.5 billion in debt since the first of the year. In terms of when you look at modeling the fourth quarter, generally. We do have one of our larger cash builds.”Now I am guessing the special will be closer to $2.75 than to $1.75, my previous guess. I am assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that CME does not pay off a ton of commercial paper or other debt this quarter, say less than $100 million. If volume picks up (cannot help but pick up, can it not?) and expenses are less than average (and that is a reasonable expectation, based on comments today), the special could be something ... special."
Don't know if this was a formality or not but CME did get the recommendation for SOFR to be the benchmark in place of LIBOR. Good thing. Ponz.
"Oh yeah, Sox win...you can put it (51) on the board...yes!"
"Well CME 123.......here we are again, upon another Friday with a chance to close in the 218's."

Here's one that even AHHAa might be interested in: DVN (Devon Energy). 3 of their last 5 dividends have been special dividends.
"Credit Suisse resumes coverage of CME with a neutral rating and a 183 price target. ......Now tell me, how in the heck can you have a ""neutral"" rating and a 183 price target?? That sure isn't neutral to me. But like any short, pump out the business CME and let them chase it up."
YEAH. I sold that 1 share at the open.. Sorry
CME Ok... Wow . . This market. Not sure
"s147 billions, a very good buy,............."
I promise if it gets back to $1000 ($200 after-split) I’ll get out and never hold it again. 
CBOE is UP and so should CME. Don't care what the rules say

"Welcome back, Grandal. Sox win. I put 75 on the board."
morgan stanley raised cme to 229 from 228. are these guys really steppin out with a prediction like that
CME has wanted you to think over these days that the 50 day MA was its first stop
CME is on a mission to get that $1000.00 a share price tag.

"CME nor any other publicly traded company is allowed to comment on buyout rumors other than of course to deny them. Only upon a time which there is a firm commitment would CME enter a response of a deal in the works. I am very suspicious of the ""no"" answer, its just too expected. I'm thinking that there is a deal going on and I for one am not happy about it."
But CBOE? Alls right in the world. Smh

"If you sell 2 shares of CME tomorrow, you can buy 5 shares of NVEC and receive #$%$ dividend in 2 months. NVEC has been paying a $1/share dividend since 2015."
CME and CBOE both down Either it's a HUGE mkt manipulation and JAIL for someoneOR ... CME didn't come back is suspicious to say the least
EPR just resumed its monthly dividend at .25/share. Current yield is 5.4%. I expect the dividend to eventually return to .38/share because that's where it was before the pandemic. I've held EPR since 2009.

"CME YTD performance DOWN 19%. We've got 6 months to make some of that back. Volumes YTD average at 22.3M and for this quarter average of 17.6M a day. So its on pace to put up near record or record numbers this year. Nobody can predict volumes. Our markets are cyclical like everyone else's and I conservatively have 17.0 a month average for the balance of the year. Anything to spark these markets will do wonders for our year if we can get them. 2nd quarter window dressing to which nobody wanted to show CME on its books is now over so now the focus can look for the next 6 months. Risk/reward favors being long both chartwise and on fundamentals. Like anything else, don't second guess that this time it will be different because it won't. Buy em when they're down."

Cubs fans and Yankee fans: what do you think of the Rizzo trade?
"Negative oil prices threaten to tarnish the image of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, and hurt the company that has long relied on it as a key source of revenue: exchange giant CME Group Inc.(CME)Chicago-based CME is home to the WTI futures contract, which is a popular way for oil drillers to protect themselves against price drops or for hedge funds to speculate on the direction of energy markets.Futures are contracts that let traders bet on the future price of commodities like oil and gold, or on financial indexes like the S&P 500. Unlike stocks, futures can sometimes drop below zero, particularly in physical commodity markets when storage facilities fill up and producers pay to get rid of their excess inventories.Negative prices have occurred in futures on natural gas, electricity and some obscure regional grades of crude oil, but until this week they had never happened in a flagship oil contract like WTI. On Monday, WTI futures for May delivery slid to minus $37.63. They later rebounded to $10.01 Tuesday when the May contract expired.CME had just changed its computer systems earlier this month to allow negative pricing in WTI, anticipating such a scenario, and many traders had discussed it as a possibility. But for many casual investors, the move was puzzling and appeared to be the latest sign of market mayhem unleashed by Covid-19.CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terrence Duffy said in an interview that WTI futures worked as designed, and their foray into negative territory was a signal of real market forces at work.""It's not a price that makes you feel good,"" he said. ""But the reality is, there is oversupply, there is under- demand that's virus-driven, and there is nowhere to put the stuff.""While CME doesn't specify how much money it makes from individual contracts, UBS analysts estimate that about 14% of its revenue this year will come from energy, which includes oil, natural gas and other contracts. Last year CME posted $4.9 billion in total revenue.CME's WTI franchise could also be hurt if investors sour on oil-focused exchange-traded funds. This week's price plunge caused hefty losses for investors in ETFs like the United States Oil Fund, a popular vehicle for betting on oil prices. Known by its ticker USO, the fund holds WTI futures and sometimes accounts for a significant chunk of activity in the contract, lifting CME's fee revenue.Last week, USO held more than a quarter of outstanding contracts for June WTI futures, following massive inflows from investors. USO's operator, United States Commodity Funds LLC, said Tuesday that it issued all its registered shares, an unusual event that effectively turns USO into a closed-end fund and could lead to further deviations between USO and oil prices.If WTI futures turn negative again, such deviations could continue, for the simple reason that an ETF--as a security--can't trade at prices below zero.""If the ETF is tied to the futures and the futures go negative while the ETF can't, there will be dislocations,"" Mr. Duffy said. ""People should know that before they invest in these instruments.""Speaking Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Duffy said the WTI expiration had gone smoothly and CME didn't anticipate any defaults by its clearing firms, the futures brokerages that act as intermediaries between traders and the exchange.Still, it is possible those brokerages' clients, such as oil-trading firms, suffered big losses. In futures markets, when contracts are settled, the exchange and its clearing firms move money from traders with losing bets to traders with winning bets. If a losing trader can't pay up, the trader's clearing firm must eat the loss. In extreme cases, client losses can push a clearing firm into default, which can force other clearing firms to cover its losses.That doesn't appear to have happened in the oil market this week. Still, some fallout from the wild price moves emerged Tuesday as Interactive Brokers Group Inc., an online brokerage popular with day traders, reported a provisionary loss of $88 million due to several clients that blew up because of Monday's collapse in WTI prices.After WTI's foray into negative territory, some analysts suggested trading volumes could migrate from WTI to its main competitor: the Brent futures contract listed on CME's archrival, Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE for short."
The annual special dividend contest has begun. Contestants estimate the payout. Last year CME paid a $2.50 special. This year CME has piled up a significant cash hoard. What will be the special?

"Lorenzo - for a moment diverting from comments about ""Life without Sox"". Of course I mean the White Sox. With the Chinese crackdown on education stocks and whatever is threatening their sovereignty, paranoia - appears the USA is the bastion of safety. The trouble of transacting anywhere or investing anywhere - that is having money parked anywhere, banking anywhere - is this: will the other party own up to a Stock transaction, a futures or option position? Will confiscation ensue? How many countries have nationalized assets overnight? Gaddafi of Libya did, Maduro of Venezuela did. In March of this year Tal education, a Chinese publicly traded company was trading at $90.00, They provide k-12 tutoring. Was super profitable. The stock is trading at $5.00 now. The Chinese government decided to ban educational training institutions. Overnight restriction - poof. The CME is 100% SAFETY guaranteed. Best hub for trading anything. Unrelated - these 3.5% ten year treasuries trading at 1.2% - when will price discovery be unbleached there? S&P in 2001 traded at 1,140 - now at 4,400. Ten year treasuries were at 6.5% in 2001. Now at 1.25% - Load up short for a move to 0.8% How do I contact Musk for a ticket to Mars? 'nough said."

Another White Sox Winner!Terry you can put #53 on the board.
so the huge volume increases year over year mean $4 lower?!
Sold puts at the low yesterday. Felt like that break was overdone. Thanks Big Daddy. Finally opened up to selling in the money options thinking if 175s were good 180s would be better. So I sold both.
For a GOOD thing....will be going to the White Sox game this afternoon! I don't have a smart phone and do not want to know whats going on around CME especially. So I have the broom ready to go! Go Dylan Cease!

The descending triangle (bullish) is still intact as long as it doesn't fail at that recent low of 204.64. It will need a rally attempt after that but don't expect miracles ( like we expect those around here ha ha). Back to 212 might be about it as the triangle starts to get squeezed and then force the issue. Ponz

I hope they don't, never wanted to see them go after a different regulatory concern and I never wanted to hear the whole synergies gained garbage. Personally, I just never saw a marriage of the two. Having said that, lets say that CME stance is correct that no talks have occurred, then this will have been the best orchestrated shakeout to an oversold level."
Oh look what happened here.

Can't see any reason for cme to rally if volume doesn't improve drastically. 12-15m doesn't cut it. Not saying things can't improve but the big market rally is getting long in the tooth.

"Don't have a thing against CME. It is a Chicago institution that I hope lasts another 150 years It's ""leaders"" outside Terry? 100% have an issue. As far as positions, i'd most certainly never talk them here. What I wrote a number of days ago with CME at 182.00 (I think?) is accurate. 100%. From that point in time, two things have happened. Number 1, CME had its first clearing firm fail. Ronin. Not surprised they failed. The next item I wrote, that successive closes below 21,500 in the dow would bring corporate debt and CDS's into play has also taken place. Immediately. It has. Major corporation all around this country were about to roll over. ZERO planning and Zero cash on their balance sheet with which to pay credit obligations. We all know how that ends.What did our Fed do this morning?? UNLIMITED purchases of bonds and mortgages and for the first time ever, corporate bond ETF's. Seems the geniuses Donald Wilson and Ken Griffin don't know how to make a market in those items. Simply astounding that our Fed unilaterally bailed out Corporate Debt. Since when do they have this authority?! And with whose money? Taxpayer money? Really? But they didn't just bail out corporations, they bailed THEMSELVES out. Rates close to zero promulgated all this. But they have no right. Their mandate is ccy's and interest rates. In 2013, the Fed added mortgages and some CDO's. But corporate bonds in 2020 ??? You should all feel lucky. Without Fed's action this morning, CME was headed to zero. But I'd be careful if I were you. Bryan Durkin has ZERO clue what is on his books. As for the geniuses who swooped in to buy Ronin's positions for pennies on the dollar, why don't you guys ask those geniuses why they can't come up with a rate in a bond market or a CDS or a currency swap? Last, but not least, any idea why the stocks were limit down at the open last night?? I'll tell you why. Because the geniuses Ken and Don don't have a single freaking clue about pricing an asset. Every price is simply based on someone ELSE's action. If this were not true, they would be able to produce prices in a vacuum. But they don't. And they can't. S&P futures were limit down simply because there were sell orders in the book. Ken and Don get to look 10 orders deep into the book every millisecond of every day. Of course this was illegal the first 130 years of CME. Amazing what money does to ethics and character. I haven't a clue what will happen next after this corporate bailout. It should work, but viruses (kind of like a black box market maker) don't think. Good luck gentlemen (and ladies)."

STURGIS SD HERE I COME.
204's on the open ... nice fill bozo
What happened? Stops below 50 day? CME is maybe worse than the Cubs right now
Increased volatility is a positive for all of the exchanges. Federal debt growing is a positive since it ( hopefully ) means more money in long term circulation.Important to note is that the velocity of domestic US dollars is down because of the virus shutdown despite however much that the FED and Treasury have taken on. I.e. The stimulus has zero chance of being too large. Dollars are still desperately needed in emerging markets and the EU and thus the value of dollars has gone up despite more printing which in turn has a negative effect on US equities.I expect previous highs to be taken out ( by all of exchange houses ) once the destructive shutdown has been moderated. This process can take 3 years but the famous Politician who sold lots of ICE shares at the end of Feb. isn't going to gain a long term value. He sold because of 1. Old age 2. He gets free shares at predetermined time intervals and has to sell to diversify and/or realize his wage. These trades were an ongoing pattern with little to no similarity to inside trading. We should all be happy that everyone can trade freely and that all of the important exchanges have kept on working in mint condition. Good luck
What’s going to happen when the CME settles the Langer vs CME lawsuit. Or better yet ends up going to trial?
"300, I hope you didn't put the ladder away. It looks like you'll be hanging up #47 tonight!"

"From this morning’s conference call:“In terms of our leverage, again, as I mentioned last quarter, we did hit our one times debt to EBITDA target, and we paid off the balance of $100 million in commercial paper this quarter. So, we have no commercial paper outstanding.”"
"My news source shows INSIDER SELL.........the dude George, sold 1000 shares AHAHAHAHAHHAHHAAAA"
The way this has continued to trade leads me to think more and more that CME will announce a buyout of CBOE ( and I have thought that the deal was in the works all along)which the market doesn't like as it thinks we are overpaying for the asset which we could tell from the initial reaction.
Anyone know where I can get paid to loan out my shares to shorts. I might as well get something for watching this debacle.
"Futures Trading Volume Soars and CME Group's Stock Will Benefit, Analyst Says -- Barrons.comDOW JONES & COMPANY, INC. 11:11 AM ET 3/30/2020 As Covid-19 jolts the market, trading volumes have jumped by half at CME Group, the Chicago-based operator of futures exchanges. That makes CME stock a Buy, Raymond James analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy says.Shares of CME have sold off 15% this year to a Friday close of $171, but with Investors using CME futures contracts to manage their risk in stocks, metals, energy and interest rates, CME shares could rise by at least that much, the analyst says. In a Monday morning note, he upgraded his rating on CME stock to Outperform, with a price target of $194. CME stock was up 1.7% to $174.21, in line with gains in the S&P 500.Wariness toward exchange operators such as CME harks back to the financial crisis in 2009, when trading volume on its exchanges fell some 20%, O'Shaughnessy says. Today's trading environment is different, he argues, thanks to robust automation and a less-leveraged bank sector.CME futures volumes are up about 46% this year. Trading has doubled in stock-index futures, has jumped by two- thirds in metals and by more than a third in energy and interest rates. Just before the coronavirus spike, the firm had raised its prices.The government will fund Covid-19 stimulus programs with long-term paper. That could be another boon for CME trading. Back in 2009, more than half the firm's rate revenue came from short-term products, but now about two-thirds come from longer-dated products.The closing of CME's trading floors on March 13 didn't disrupt trading volume, the analyst reports, and could actually enhance the company's profit.Looming over his bullish view, he admits, are worries about a protracted recession. After conversations with CME, O'Shaughnessy says he feels reassured. CME also has more products and more salespeople to support its customers, says the analyst. Traders can access its platform nearly 24 hours a day.Volumes dropped in 2009 when big banks had to unwind their leveraged balance sheets. The banks are better- positioned now. O'Shaughnessey sees no threat from systemic risk. A small trading firm, Ronin Capital, recently found itself in a financial jam, but it represented less than 0.1% of CME's clearing-margin loans, and CME says it has seen no widespread signs of stress among its customers.Write to Bill Alpert at william.alpert@barrons.com"
Did you see how the Cubs' three relief pitchers didn't know there was a no-hitter going on? They can't see the scoreboard from the bullpen. The closer wondered what everyone was celebrating.
I had a dream. CME posted revenues and earnings that beat analyst estimates and CME's stock RALLIED off of the news.......then I woke up and it was only a dream. Could it actually happen for once?........
"Not much green today, but a gold stock that pays a monthly dividend is. If you like to see the ticker, click thumb up."

"Yesterday’s haircut did not portend a disappointing volume report for May. The numbers look pretty good, especially the yoy increase in interest rate volume. So, apparently yesterday’s drop was computer driven. The computer giveth and the computer taketh away. Blessed be the computer."
"Looked to me like someone forced to liquidate CME shares yesterdayPerhaps the overnight action clipped someone and mid day margin run ended up with a callOnly asset (Haha, that's good) to sell was stockFCMs and certain traders at FCMs have stock as part of capital backstop, legacy of older days and memberships as collateral at brokerThe selling was relentless, high volume, into a good tapeAny close observer of fundamentals sees some improvement in Open Interest and recent volume trendsICE (I know Kelly Loffler won) was strong as wellEither that or the shorts are totally emboldened and pressed this with huge fresh selling, at the lows of the moveOr ...... only about a thousand other possible explanations starting with, CME's management LOL"
I just saw this username on another board - 'Trumpwon'.
Ascending or Descending? Both Bullish ..... Hmmmmm
Project CME and its assignment: Go fill that upside gap from the 186-188 area and create a bowl to which a cup and handle will develop and give an upside projection of 215
"CME volumes for April look to be up 13% over last year. OK, now for the nervous sorts, May of last year and June of last year won't be beat. May was the 2nd best month we ever had and June not far behind. So, ""if"" one was to plug in numbers consistent with what we did this month for May and June of 17.7M a day (expect to beat that in May with the rollover) what you will end up with is a company, CME that on a semi annual basis will still be averaging 22.39M a day which, by far if the year were to end would be RECORD year. And even if you plugged the month of May in for the balance of the year, we would still finish with a record of over 20M a day. Now if anybody thinks that the rest of this year will be held down to these conservative numbers, all I can say is good luck to you."
This is disgraceful
"White Sox take 2 of 3 from Red Sox and yes, yesterday's game is put on the board. Great series. White Sox playing the role of spoilers as Toronto now ahead of Boston while the Yankees now find themselves on the outside looking in. Going to be a great finish to the season over there."
"They really HANDED it to us today.... bond market one sided thinking rates go higher and what to they do, OF COURSE they break lower. Classic"
"so a friend of mine invited me to go to the mets game today to see jacob degrom pitch. we had seats in a private area below the left center field wall that holds about 50 people. degrom gave up a home run to the first better and the fan who caught the home run threw the ball back out on the field. the left fielder, dom smith threw the ball back near me and i got the home run ball . the fans were yelling to throw it back, but i am a YANKEE FAN and didn't throw it back. lol"
A seven dollar rally today makes a bullish engulfing candle. Not too much to ask.Or Cease throws a no hitter. Which is more likely.

CME is heading for $210!
thought cme would get a little rally before the close
What happens after cme rallies off earnings? Anyone remember?It's like a pitcher hitting a homer. You know it can happen...
just bought this back
CME ... so predictable
"Lutnick. Espeed work up state. Another way to screw the end user. Making firms commit and pay to use the platform. I got a feeling it’s all about Howard and BGC. End users, not so much."
"Morgan Stanley on July 15 updated CME Risk-Reward Report, setting a $229 target, noting a Bear case for $120 and a Bull case for $338. EPS estimates for December 2021, $6.83December 2022, $7.42December 2023, $7.86."
"In the meantime, back to the LOWS OF THE DAY as I type this. JOKE. Ponz."
CME sure knows how to put in some nasty red candles
"Nothing is fair in life, but I thought LL would get the victory since he left the game with a 7-4 lead. For Hendriks to get the victory is just plain WRONG!"
I thought Ponz was kidding about CME getting DFA'd. CME has just been designated for assignment to Micro Ship Inc. It must remain there until it gets its head screwed on straight.

"I hope that Lollapalooza goes BUST and that nobody shows up. People having to Bring covid results, masks, certificates....and worst of all, that big fat CLOWN governor pritzker says he's gonna show up."
I think it’s simple. To get a 4% yield. The quarterly dividends are $0.75 plus you need an additional $3.00 ex-dividend at the end of the year (assumption) . This puts the stock right at $150.00
Glued to the 200 day for a couple of weeks now.

"The article says, “CME Group's earnings per share have grown rapidly in recent years, although more than half of its profits are being paid out as dividends, which makes us wonder if the company has a limited number of reinvestment opportunities in its business.” Did he forget to mention CME’s purchase of NEX? ( which is why they cut the x-div.) Although that was painful at the time. It did turn out to be the most prudent move."
"Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, was arrested Thursday afternoon at the U.S. Capitol while protesting in favor of voting rights legislation. Allow me to explain it to you, Joyce. If you are a U.S. citizen and you are a registered voter then you have the right to vote. Not that complicated!"

CME down $22 on year or about 11% with blow away better volume numbers year to dateI guess no one is going to trade ever again on CME but they will trade on ICEHmmmmmmMaybe it's management???
"Sorry about the typo - 0.8% not .8. I was in a knot. Don't need a treasuries primer, duly noted though - but looking to you to be the market timer. There was a guy in the trading pit who coined the expression ""you know and I know"". If you don't know what that means, read the book entitled ""Knowing how to know"". Let's keep it respectful. All those who don't believe the 10 year will slice through the 2.2% level, raise raise your hand or raise your margin."
Anyone else think this is the start of a whole market downturn.Time to get out of all equities!!!
