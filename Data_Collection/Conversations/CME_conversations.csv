The annual special dividend contest has begun. Contestants estimate the payout. Last year CME paid a $2.50 special. This year CME has piled up a significant cash hoard. What will be the special?
"Futures Trading Volume Soars and CME Group's Stock Will Benefit, Analyst Says -- Barrons.comDOW JONES & COMPANY, INC. 11:11 AM ET 3/30/2020 As Covid-19 jolts the market, trading volumes have jumped by half at CME Group, the Chicago-based operator of futures exchanges. That makes CME stock a Buy, Raymond James analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy says.Shares of CME have sold off 15% this year to a Friday close of $171, but with Investors using CME futures contracts to manage their risk in stocks, metals, energy and interest rates, CME shares could rise by at least that much, the analyst says. In a Monday morning note, he upgraded his rating on CME stock to Outperform, with a price target of $194. CME stock was up 1.7% to $174.21, in line with gains in the S&P 500.Wariness toward exchange operators such as CME harks back to the financial crisis in 2009, when trading volume on its exchanges fell some 20%, O'Shaughnessy says. Today's trading environment is different, he argues, thanks to robust automation and a less-leveraged bank sector.CME futures volumes are up about 46% this year. Trading has doubled in stock-index futures, has jumped by two- thirds in metals and by more than a third in energy and interest rates. Just before the coronavirus spike, the firm had raised its prices.The government will fund Covid-19 stimulus programs with long-term paper. That could be another boon for CME trading. Back in 2009, more than half the firm's rate revenue came from short-term products, but now about two-thirds come from longer-dated products.The closing of CME's trading floors on March 13 didn't disrupt trading volume, the analyst reports, and could actually enhance the company's profit.Looming over his bullish view, he admits, are worries about a protracted recession. After conversations with CME, O'Shaughnessy says he feels reassured. CME also has more products and more salespeople to support its customers, says the analyst. Traders can access its platform nearly 24 hours a day.Volumes dropped in 2009 when big banks had to unwind their leveraged balance sheets. The banks are better- positioned now. O'Shaughnessey sees no threat from systemic risk. A small trading firm, Ronin Capital, recently found itself in a financial jam, but it represented less than 0.1% of CME's clearing-margin loans, and CME says it has seen no widespread signs of stress among its customers.Write to Bill Alpert at william.alpert@barrons.com"

"Sorry about the typo - 0.8% not .8. I was in a knot. Don't need a treasuries primer, duly noted though - but looking to you to be the market timer. There was a guy in the trading pit who coined the expression ""you know and I know"". If you don't know what that means, read the book entitled ""Knowing how to know"". Let's keep it respectful. All those who don't believe the 10 year will slice through the 2.2% level, raise raise your hand or raise your margin."

From one of the great movies of all time and now one of the worst stocks.....
The AMD-XLNX merger was approved. Both are taking off today.
"The article says, “CME Group's earnings per share have grown rapidly in recent years, although more than half of its profits are being paid out as dividends, which makes us wonder if the company has a limited number of reinvestment opportunities in its business.” Did he forget to mention CME’s purchase of NEX? ( which is why they cut the x-div.) Although that was painful at the time. It did turn out to be the most prudent move."
"wow, denied rumor of acquisition. It will bounce back tomorrow :)"

Bullish ascending triangle or bearish head and shoulders? Going with the former.
CME sure knows how to put in some nasty red candles
We are at an inflection point between the 20 day (215.35) and 50 day (212.89) We’ve stayed above the 50 for the past few days - barely. Then touched the 20 this morning and proceeded to fall $3. We will see

"At least we CAN'T lose any money in CME today, nor can we LOSE another baseball game"
"CME volumes for April look to be up 13% over last year. OK, now for the nervous sorts, May of last year and June of last year won't be beat. May was the 2nd best month we ever had and June not far behind. So, ""if"" one was to plug in numbers consistent with what we did this month for May and June of 17.7M a day (expect to beat that in May with the rollover) what you will end up with is a company, CME that on a semi annual basis will still be averaging 22.39M a day which, by far if the year were to end would be RECORD year. And even if you plugged the month of May in for the balance of the year, we would still finish with a record of over 20M a day. Now if anybody thinks that the rest of this year will be held down to these conservative numbers, all I can say is good luck to you."
CME is up over 1%!
Don't know if this was a formality or not but CME did get the recommendation for SOFR to be the benchmark in place of LIBOR. Good thing. Ponz.
"Outperforming.....wadda ya know.....Citigroup which recently increased price to 250, today lowered it to 248. Woopie"
"Without dividends counted on both the SPY and CME, the SPY has returned 17% YTD and the CME has returned 16%. With dividends, we have them beat although we do owe our performance to the S&P because we are nothing more than a market performer. Can that change again one day is the question?"
"Im done posting for a bit fellas. My guess ul see 170 again by Halloween. Maybe then, hopefully it will find a btm. And now, CME is down on the year! Yay! Market only up 30+ percent. Smh. Im tired of watching this pig ruin my day."
AND THE REASON its UP.. I bought a 1 share at the open.. SIZE right in their face

"My equal weight FAANG stock portfolio has done exceptionally well YTD, up 40% TR vs 4.5% TR for the S&P. The question now is: does one hold on to the FAANG stocks or will there be a better alternative sector going forward? And if so, which 5 stocks within that sector would you invest in? My answer to all of the above is, I believe the below five stocks will be the top performers of the S&P for the next six months (I refer to the picks as BPMCS):BLACKROCK $BLKPAYPAL $PYPLMASTERCARD $MACME GROUP $CMECHARLES SCHWAB $SCHWBPMCS stocks might have performed 15% YTD vs 40% of the FAANG stocks, BPMCS has however, half the forward P/E multiple than FAANG and almost double the ROE.Again, I’m not predicting that FAANG will do poorly from now on, all I’m prognosticating is that BPMCS will be the top 5 performing stocks in the S&P from now till the end of the year.AP"

"The CME leg up to $225 was generated by unusually high August volume numbers. Perhaps trade believes this was an aberration. $17 Trillion parked in a negative-rate parking lot is poised to slosh treasuries, securities and every asset class. You gonna bet that $17 negative zone trillion does not turn to $40 N trillion? Higher? And what if this galaxy goes into reverse? Like, let’s say negative $30 trillion moves into positive 30 trillion? 60 million volume? 80 million? This trail is ablaze with ambiguity. New norm is defined by a deviation outside a norm. The 10 year is now in a 1.0%-3.0% plus range. Eventually 4.0% when the printing press goes into obsolete mode and CPI is at 4% bid. Can we say the 10 year is in a long term range of minus 1% to plus 4%? We’re not in a global lull and all the asset classes are in throttle mode. If Bezos is poised to become the first trillionair, then you ought to know that a quad trillion is composed of one thousand trillions. The LSE will not be bought by Hong Kong - No more than Huawei will not be able to buy Apple. But CME should outbid LSE for Refinitiv. Hmmm, how? Ask the negstive $17 trillion crew for the $40 billion - chump change. It’ll yield way above minus 0.8. Will CME go to $275 before $175? What’s you’re call? Could be fully priced at $375? $575? What say ya all? Oh yes - almost forgot. The biggest casino in the world is only a click away - exceptional because it’s the biggest mandatory casino. When the dog wags the tail, 25 million volume, but when the Zipf wags the dog? The amulet known as the CME is indispensable. Phantom of the Matrix"

I think it’s simple. To get a 4% yield. The quarterly dividends are $0.75 plus you need an additional $3.00 ex-dividend at the end of the year (assumption) . This puts the stock right at $150.00

"Don't have a thing against CME. It is a Chicago institution that I hope lasts another 150 years It's ""leaders"" outside Terry? 100% have an issue. As far as positions, i'd most certainly never talk them here. What I wrote a number of days ago with CME at 182.00 (I think?) is accurate. 100%. From that point in time, two things have happened. Number 1, CME had its first clearing firm fail. Ronin. Not surprised they failed. The next item I wrote, that successive closes below 21,500 in the dow would bring corporate debt and CDS's into play has also taken place. Immediately. It has. Major corporation all around this country were about to roll over. ZERO planning and Zero cash on their balance sheet with which to pay credit obligations. We all know how that ends.What did our Fed do this morning?? UNLIMITED purchases of bonds and mortgages and for the first time ever, corporate bond ETF's. Seems the geniuses Donald Wilson and Ken Griffin don't know how to make a market in those items. Simply astounding that our Fed unilaterally bailed out Corporate Debt. Since when do they have this authority?! And with whose money? Taxpayer money? Really? But they didn't just bail out corporations, they bailed THEMSELVES out. Rates close to zero promulgated all this. But they have no right. Their mandate is ccy's and interest rates. In 2013, the Fed added mortgages and some CDO's. But corporate bonds in 2020 ??? You should all feel lucky. Without Fed's action this morning, CME was headed to zero. But I'd be careful if I were you. Bryan Durkin has ZERO clue what is on his books. As for the geniuses who swooped in to buy Ronin's positions for pennies on the dollar, why don't you guys ask those geniuses why they can't come up with a rate in a bond market or a CDS or a currency swap? Last, but not least, any idea why the stocks were limit down at the open last night?? I'll tell you why. Because the geniuses Ken and Don don't have a single freaking clue about pricing an asset. Every price is simply based on someone ELSE's action. If this were not true, they would be able to produce prices in a vacuum. But they don't. And they can't. S&P futures were limit down simply because there were sell orders in the book. Ken and Don get to look 10 orders deep into the book every millisecond of every day. Of course this was illegal the first 130 years of CME. Amazing what money does to ethics and character. I haven't a clue what will happen next after this corporate bailout. It should work, but viruses (kind of like a black box market maker) don't think. Good luck gentlemen (and ladies)."

Here's one that even AHHAa might be interested in: DVN (Devon Energy). 3 of their last 5 dividends have been special dividends.
What a funny little critter CME is. It almost a tell on the markets.
"CME right on schedule, new lows of day constantly AND looking to go negative, what a you know what"
"From today’s conference call, relative to the special dividend:“we had about $1.3 billion cash on hand – was comfortable with the $700 million minimum cash balance, we’re comfortable at that – that level. We have $1.3 billion cash on hand. We’ve got $3.9 billion in total debt of which we have $435 million in commercial paper and we’re currently sitting at a 1.2 times debt to EBITDA as we paid down about $0.5 billion in debt since the first of the year. In terms of when you look at modeling the fourth quarter, generally. We do have one of our larger cash builds.”Now I am guessing the special will be closer to $2.75 than to $1.75, my previous guess. I am assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that CME does not pay off a ton of commercial paper or other debt this quarter, say less than $100 million. If volume picks up (cannot help but pick up, can it not?) and expenses are less than average (and that is a reasonable expectation, based on comments today), the special could be something ... special."
Increased volatility is a positive for all of the exchanges. Federal debt growing is a positive since it ( hopefully ) means more money in long term circulation.Important to note is that the velocity of domestic US dollars is down because of the virus shutdown despite however much that the FED and Treasury have taken on. I.e. The stimulus has zero chance of being too large. Dollars are still desperately needed in emerging markets and the EU and thus the value of dollars has gone up despite more printing which in turn has a negative effect on US equities.I expect previous highs to be taken out ( by all of exchange houses ) once the destructive shutdown has been moderated. This process can take 3 years but the famous Politician who sold lots of ICE shares at the end of Feb. isn't going to gain a long term value. He sold because of 1. Old age 2. He gets free shares at predetermined time intervals and has to sell to diversify and/or realize his wage. These trades were an ongoing pattern with little to no similarity to inside trading. We should all be happy that everyone can trade freely and that all of the important exchanges have kept on working in mint condition. Good luck

"For those of us that have a LONG TERM outlook on CME's charts, in the recent past, I had brought up on the ever so SLOW MOVING weekly chart, that there is a cup and handle in the works. The bowl has been one year in the makes from the left to the right peaks. Now, the handle, which did step away from that upward channel is formed or may be forming for weeks yet, we'll only know after the fact. It would be nice if it completed the handle now and broke out to the upside but mentally, I can not make that assertion. In the end if this does play out, upside target is in the 260's. This requires that patience that is really needed on this one. To think that the Analysts with those high 1 year price targets in the 240 ish area this fits right in with that. Dreaming, maybe or most likely however, anybody got anything better to look at?"
Yeah. THAT'S RIGHT. Tack on the GREEN .
I have not been able to find out when CME declares the amount of their next dividend. Hopefully another bump in the quarterly.

"Negative oil prices threaten to tarnish the image of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, and hurt the company that has long relied on it as a key source of revenue: exchange giant CME Group Inc.(CME)Chicago-based CME is home to the WTI futures contract, which is a popular way for oil drillers to protect themselves against price drops or for hedge funds to speculate on the direction of energy markets.Futures are contracts that let traders bet on the future price of commodities like oil and gold, or on financial indexes like the S&P 500. Unlike stocks, futures can sometimes drop below zero, particularly in physical commodity markets when storage facilities fill up and producers pay to get rid of their excess inventories.Negative prices have occurred in futures on natural gas, electricity and some obscure regional grades of crude oil, but until this week they had never happened in a flagship oil contract like WTI. On Monday, WTI futures for May delivery slid to minus $37.63. They later rebounded to $10.01 Tuesday when the May contract expired.CME had just changed its computer systems earlier this month to allow negative pricing in WTI, anticipating such a scenario, and many traders had discussed it as a possibility. But for many casual investors, the move was puzzling and appeared to be the latest sign of market mayhem unleashed by Covid-19.CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terrence Duffy said in an interview that WTI futures worked as designed, and their foray into negative territory was a signal of real market forces at work.""It's not a price that makes you feel good,"" he said. ""But the reality is, there is oversupply, there is under- demand that's virus-driven, and there is nowhere to put the stuff.""While CME doesn't specify how much money it makes from individual contracts, UBS analysts estimate that about 14% of its revenue this year will come from energy, which includes oil, natural gas and other contracts. Last year CME posted $4.9 billion in total revenue.CME's WTI franchise could also be hurt if investors sour on oil-focused exchange-traded funds. This week's price plunge caused hefty losses for investors in ETFs like the United States Oil Fund, a popular vehicle for betting on oil prices. Known by its ticker USO, the fund holds WTI futures and sometimes accounts for a significant chunk of activity in the contract, lifting CME's fee revenue.Last week, USO held more than a quarter of outstanding contracts for June WTI futures, following massive inflows from investors. USO's operator, United States Commodity Funds LLC, said Tuesday that it issued all its registered shares, an unusual event that effectively turns USO into a closed-end fund and could lead to further deviations between USO and oil prices.If WTI futures turn negative again, such deviations could continue, for the simple reason that an ETF--as a security--can't trade at prices below zero.""If the ETF is tied to the futures and the futures go negative while the ETF can't, there will be dislocations,"" Mr. Duffy said. ""People should know that before they invest in these instruments.""Speaking Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Duffy said the WTI expiration had gone smoothly and CME didn't anticipate any defaults by its clearing firms, the futures brokerages that act as intermediaries between traders and the exchange.Still, it is possible those brokerages' clients, such as oil-trading firms, suffered big losses. In futures markets, when contracts are settled, the exchange and its clearing firms move money from traders with losing bets to traders with winning bets. If a losing trader can't pay up, the trader's clearing firm must eat the loss. In extreme cases, client losses can push a clearing firm into default, which can force other clearing firms to cover its losses.That doesn't appear to have happened in the oil market this week. Still, some fallout from the wild price moves emerged Tuesday as Interactive Brokers Group Inc., an online brokerage popular with day traders, reported a provisionary loss of $88 million due to several clients that blew up because of Monday's collapse in WTI prices.After WTI's foray into negative territory, some analysts suggested trading volumes could migrate from WTI to its main competitor: the Brent futures contract listed on CME's archrival, Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE for short."

What happens after cme rallies off earnings? Anyone remember?It's like a pitcher hitting a homer. You know it can happen...

AHHHAA......noticing that CME is HTB
I put 50 on the board...yes!
we are good now. deutsche bank raised us to 200 from 198
Well that didn't last
CME Ok... Wow . . This market. Not sure
Ponz was right...AAPL not waiting for the cup handle.
I had a dream. CME posted revenues and earnings that beat analyst estimates and CME's stock RALLIED off of the news.......then I woke up and it was only a dream. Could it actually happen for once?........
#$%$ ??
Please CME Board of Directors ...CLEAN HOUSEDuffy needs to be shown the doorNOW
Rumors were true ... CME + CBOE = weak CME/strong CBOE (for about the past 6 months)Look for Settlement news nowSee you at 180
"Rodon SPECTACULAR.....they combined for a 1 hitter. Now for a double header today. The bulldog Lance Lynn up first and for the second game, maybe it will be Reynaldo Lopez"
put that big come back up on the board boys!!anderson is the man....
Just BOUGHT a 1000 CME $205. 75 . The SKY is the limit
The descending triangle (bullish) is still intact as long as it doesn't fail at that recent low of 204.64. It will need a rally attempt after that but don't expect miracles ( like we expect those around here ha ha). Back to 212 might be about it as the triangle starts to get squeezed and then force the issue. Ponz
I bought another 1000 at $196. 60... NOT BAD..

"I hope that Lollapalooza goes BUST and that nobody shows up. People having to Bring covid results, masks, certificates....and worst of all, that big fat CLOWN governor pritzker says he's gonna show up."

CBOE is UP and so should CME. Don't care what the rules say
But CBOE? Alls right in the world. Smh
Can't see any reason for cme to rally if volume doesn't improve drastically. 12-15m doesn't cut it. Not saying things can't improve but the big market rally is getting long in the tooth.
Adam Engel hit another 3-run homer!
Anyone know where I can get paid to loan out my shares to shorts. I might as well get something for watching this debacle.

"CME nor any other publicly traded company is allowed to comment on buyout rumors other than of course to deny them. Only upon a time which there is a firm commitment would CME enter a response of a deal in the works. I am very suspicious of the ""no"" answer, its just too expected. I'm thinking that there is a deal going on and I for one am not happy about it."
Overall market making new all time highsCME ... new lows of the move
I meant to post this yesterday...Tony Esposito R.I.P.A record 15 shutouts in his rookie season!

CME rallied 50% off the Oct 29 low....What did you guys expect? I will reload when the island gap is filled at $152.13 other meaningful stocks to trade than this.

CME is heading for $210!
Boy am I stupid…

Good thing I left my broom out!
Gavin Sheets....YES!
EPR just resumed its monthly dividend at .25/share. Current yield is 5.4%. I expect the dividend to eventually return to .38/share because that's where it was before the pandemic. I've held EPR since 2009.
The way this has continued to trade leads me to think more and more that CME will announce a buyout of CBOE ( and I have thought that the deal was in the works all along)which the market doesn't like as it thinks we are overpaying for the asset which we could tell from the initial reaction.
"White Sox take 2 of 3 from Red Sox and yes, yesterday's game is put on the board. Great series. White Sox playing the role of spoilers as Toronto now ahead of Boston while the Yankees now find themselves on the outside looking in. Going to be a great finish to the season over there."
"CME YTD performance DOWN 19%. We've got 6 months to make some of that back. Volumes YTD average at 22.3M and for this quarter average of 17.6M a day. So its on pace to put up near record or record numbers this year. Nobody can predict volumes. Our markets are cyclical like everyone else's and I conservatively have 17.0 a month average for the balance of the year. Anything to spark these markets will do wonders for our year if we can get them. 2nd quarter window dressing to which nobody wanted to show CME on its books is now over so now the focus can look for the next 6 months. Risk/reward favors being long both chartwise and on fundamentals. Like anything else, don't second guess that this time it will be different because it won't. Buy em when they're down."
"""The Field of Dreams""......I think this game will have significant meaning for the White Sox especially if they win. It will give them a feeling of winning in an arena of importance in a one game only atmosphere. Looking forward to it."
"Well, I had the date of the announcement of the special dividend right....BUT I didn't get an increase in it. Flat at $2.50 once again."
"Why is CME up this morning? I don't care why.....ha ha....even if it is because of bitcoin of all things. We need something to get some momentum going so whatever excuse it is, we'll take it."
does anybody have any stocks that are doing great that they would want to share with us? or anything that they have been watching that they think is ready to make a move. thx
What happened? Stops below 50 day? CME is maybe worse than the Cubs right now
The market tell. CME. It has a nose for it .

I'm not a chart reader but AAPL seems to be breaking out from a cup w handle.
cme denies all cboe rumors. no such talks were started so says the report...
"Close to unchanged on the weekly ... incredible after the lows off earningsGot a plug on CNBC by a hot chick too ... hot being a relative term perhapsIn any event, CME is bought on breaks ... not getting the 6 even print on point makes it just three boxes back which I would loves Poles' input about but seems good to meAs for Ponz's Qs re BrokerTec and earnings call I recently saw a panel where lawyers in the industry were talking about their clients gearing up for cash bond trading and their clients were prop firms etc Don't want to pump but CBOT tried this years ago if anyone remembers, long thought to be the holy grailAt same event, lawyer from Eris Exchange admitted they licensed to their SWAPs IP to CME because of ""DISTRIBUTION"" of their product over the GLOBEX systemMust admit, the reason CME won the Chicago exchange battle was because of self clearing and globex ... globex maybe even more important to the issueIF cash bond trading can grow like the money being spent gearing up indicates it might (These lawyers aren't cheap, CME's onboarding clients etc also), CME is way undervalued ..IMO350+ IF (and a big if) cash bond trading on Broker Tec get a retail trade ....."

"For anyone that might be interested, first volumes for November averaged 19.26M up 5.8% and for the year, rough numbers have us at 19.5M average per month which would be a record year. December will bring that down a bit but the record ADV should hold."

"In the meantime, back to the LOWS OF THE DAY as I type this. JOKE. Ponz."
It wasn't that long ago that AAPL and CME were at the same price. A few people on this board were discussing switching out of CME to AAPL. Did anybody do it--even with a few of their shares?I didn't!
A White Sox Winner!Good job Ponz. You can put #48 on the board.

"Lorenzo - for a moment diverting from comments about ""Life without Sox"". Of course I mean the White Sox. With the Chinese crackdown on education stocks and whatever is threatening their sovereignty, paranoia - appears the USA is the bastion of safety. The trouble of transacting anywhere or investing anywhere - that is having money parked anywhere, banking anywhere - is this: will the other party own up to a Stock transaction, a futures or option position? Will confiscation ensue? How many countries have nationalized assets overnight? Gaddafi of Libya did, Maduro of Venezuela did. In March of this year Tal education, a Chinese publicly traded company was trading at $90.00, They provide k-12 tutoring. Was super profitable. The stock is trading at $5.00 now. The Chinese government decided to ban educational training institutions. Overnight restriction - poof. The CME is 100% SAFETY guaranteed. Best hub for trading anything. Unrelated - these 3.5% ten year treasuries trading at 1.2% - when will price discovery be unbleached there? S&P in 2001 traded at 1,140 - now at 4,400. Ten year treasuries were at 6.5% in 2001. Now at 1.25% - Load up short for a move to 0.8% How do I contact Musk for a ticket to Mars? 'nough said."

"For a while earlier this year we heard rumors of talks between CME and CBOE. Is there anything developing or was that only idle speculation? If CME were to buy CBOE, then the SEC becomes a new regulator. Who needs that? On the other hand, how else does CME achieve significant growth?"
Sox win!

Like to give a special shout out to Poles and Ponze and the Cme’s with the different numbers behind their handles. U guy have kept me from panic selling multiple times with ur info and insights. I appreciate it. And to Ahha and Pinzo thanks for the insight guts and laughs. Ive probably met some of u in the past without knowing it but seems i know u a bit from here. Be well"
Sold puts at the low yesterday. Felt like that break was overdone. Thanks Big Daddy. Finally opened up to selling in the money options thinking if 175s were good 180s would be better. So I sold both.

"so it looks like there will be trading again and cme will prosper. we needed that downgrade to go higher. we need another downgrade. i swear if cme gets back to 225, i will sell 10 shares."
"300, I hope you didn't put the ladder away. It looks like you'll be hanging up #47 tonight!"
One of the reasons I bought CME was I figured it would do well on days like this. CME is my green island in a sea of red today.

"When they say that there are no buyouts being talked about, that usually means THERE IS. I hope they don't, never wanted to see them go after a different regulatory concern and I never wanted to hear the whole synergies gained garbage. Personally, I just never saw a marriage of the two. Having said that, lets say that CME stance is correct that no talks have occurred, then this will have been the best orchestrated shakeout to an oversold level."
Two out of last ten it closed higher. That is way better than one out of seven.
