The way this has continued to trade leads me to think more and more that CME will announce a buyout of CBOE ( and I have thought that the deal was in the works all along)which the market doesn't like as it thinks we are overpaying for the asset which we could tell from the initial reaction.
"The ""Guardian's"" threw the white flag with that trade for second baseman Cesar to the Sox plus we got another quality reliever from the Cubs who don't have any towels."

Its PONZ ZO
CME group plc is s147 billions wealthy
what is there to say at this point....
Any idea what last Oct adv was?
White Sox win!
The descending triangle (bullish) is still intact as long as it doesn't fail at that recent low of 204.64. It will need a rally attempt after that but don't expect miracles ( like we expect those around here ha ha). Back to 212 might be about it as the triangle starts to get squeezed and then force the issue. Ponz
"Get mentioned (bullish) on fast$, this happens"
CME investors will have a good weekend!Go Sky!
"I just bust a chop, not right to do that, saw YAHOOOSSST post CME A/ H at 211.90 up 4.71, my immediate reaction was to throw up, I still could.............."

"White Sox take 2 of 3 from Red Sox and yes, yesterday's game is put on the board. Great series. White Sox playing the role of spoilers as Toronto now ahead of Boston while the Yankees now find themselves on the outside looking in. Going to be a great finish to the season over there."
"Weekend Sox quiz: Nellie Fox played in 1,072 games.How many games did he miss?"
Glued to the 200 day for a couple of weeks now.
"sorry, another question.anyone buy oil when it was basically negative.i bought more oil stocks(mid level) but with biden, they arestill not moving at all...."
Another White Sox Winner!I put number 77 on the board

IMO Bidumb has zero leverage over the Taliban.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/biden-administration-claims-of-enormous-economic-leverage-over-taliban-met-with-doubt/ar-AAO154i?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=U531
"Its funny how over the years you can just see through these NY Investment houses. Today for example, Morgan stanley, raised price targets for both ICE from 124 to 131 maintains equal weight and NDAQ 241 from 222 maintains overweight, and what do they do to CME....you guessed it, lowered it to 217 from 224 maintained equal weight. The symbolism reeks over there"
"Adios September you, you......welcome Rocktober"
CME and CBOE both down Either it's a HUGE mkt manipulation and JAIL for someoneOR ... CME didn't come back is suspicious to say the least
"Going to that second bottle a few days back now really seemed to payoff. So when something works, keep doing it. 2 bottles please"
For a GOOD thing....will be going to the White Sox game this afternoon! I don't have a smart phone and do not want to know whats going on around CME especially. So I have the broom ready to go! Go Dylan Cease!

CME is up over 1%!
I thought Ponz was kidding about CME getting DFA'd. CME has just been designated for assignment to Micro Ship Inc. It must remain there until it gets its head screwed on straight.
"I guess I spoke too soon, Coin rallies"
Sox win! Please put 71 on the board...yes!
You can put 73 on the board!
"next year hopefully will be the year the white sox get over the hump with more experience...anyway, why does cme stock have to constantly suck...asking for a friend"
thought cme would get a little rally before the close
AHHAa has posted for 4 days. Is he OK?
A bonafide White Sox winner! #79 is up.
"When they say that there are no buyouts being talked about, that usually means THERE IS. I hope they don't, never wanted to see them go after a different regulatory concern and I never wanted to hear the whole synergies gained garbage. Personally, I just never saw a marriage of the two. Having said that, lets say that CME stance is correct that no talks have occurred, then this will have been the best orchestrated shakeout to an oversold level."
"Sox win! 4 games....on to Detroit, then Cleveland for 5. Those teams have nothing to lose."
This is disgraceful
is the cme sharing in the white sox pain of yesterday. starting off down but hopefully not staying there.... man that game was tough to watch yesterday. i hope tony has some magic still left in that bag!!
OH CMON.. IT JUST what the doctor ordered . ANYTHING
"White Sox on You Tube today, turned it on late, getting shutout, real nice graphics I must say."
"Ponz, otherwise known as a cup and handle spotter, you may have missed one. What do you think of the Sept/Oct action?"
It could have been a great 1..
Holding the rest til $302 so I can’t help here. Fingers crossed though.
Sox win streak hits 6! I put 93 on the board.
AND THE REASON its UP.. I bought a 1 share at the open.. SIZE right in their face

Does anyone else have the feeling that once that fed head powell speaks that he will ruin what might be a rare gain off of earnings?
Yahoooost won't let you post anything with the word nedib in it
BGCP plans to compete with CME stay tune
"On the $1 point chart, there's a reversal with a 204 objective."
Maybe CME could turn into a BUY. I like that. See I buy stocks that have fallen more or less out of favor. As I remember. I made a $killing last fall on CME?.....YEP. Yeah. I was buying $150s. I made $50 BUCKS
move by the fed obviously helping the cme now.hope it catches a lot of people short here.looking for a rally back into the 200's....
Sox win! I put 70 on the board.
"Somebody is going to pay dearly for these market bad closes, its too easy for them. Need to defend that."

"Im done posting for a bit fellas. My guess ul see 170 again by Halloween. Maybe then, hopefully it will find a btm. And now, CME is down on the year! Yay! Market only up 30+ percent. Smh. Im tired of watching this pig ruin my day."

"Sky, Bears, Sox win! Trifecta!!!"
"Our volumes are BACK....and are gonna get more BACK. Ever since Powell, CME has averaged 20.5M a day and this is just for starters. Lets see those rates get back to 1.74 (double top) and if that gets convincingly taken out...look out, we will really be BACK....I'll be back as ""Ahnold"" used to say."
CME is going BUCK WILD
"WELL, this month CME went NOWHERE, however that does not change the fact that it is now MILLER TIME!"

"Ponz was right about the Taliban leader being one of the prisoners released by O. In fact, the top five people in the new interim government are the same five that O traded for a deserter."
But CBOE? Alls right in the world. Smh
"s147 billions, bigger than Pfizer lately"
Three Close Reversal on the weekly (this week's close higher than last 3 weeks)Seems like a bottom at least was put in this past weekGap and go over 200 to never see these handles again?That would be nice - if unlikely and very much not in CMEs DNA

SOX WIN!If someone had wrote this ending as a movie script nobody would believe it.
"all financial news channels have the cme totally denying any takeover talks with the cboe.and as you can see, the cboe has given back all of its gains.but of course, the cme is still down $5.60!go figure..."
AHHHAA......noticing that CME is HTB
Two out of last ten it closed higher. That is way better than one out of seven.
This needs more cowbell
"At least we CAN'T lose any money in CME today, nor can we LOSE another baseball game"
"Concerning CME Management, especially the CEO suite"
"Cool name Mathias - Matthew for short - right? And Bachmeier - sports too right? What do you know about the Sox? Not the Sox you wear. No - as to crypto - astrophysicist or nuclear science background? Do you recognize that when traders offer anything for sale, they really want to buy everything. But do tell more about your approach. Mine is the algorithm that lifts the blanket from the hashtag."

Well alright alright alright....we got a 204 print and a double top breakout to 229 in spite of Jefferies cutting CME target to 225 from 235
"this may sound crazy being cme is cme, but i am surprised it is not performing better....GO SOX!!!"
"Nothing is fair in life, but I thought LL would get the victory since he left the game with a 7-4 lead. For Hendriks to get the victory is just plain WRONG!"
Read a good outlook on the rate futures. Compared it to the volume increases from 2014-19.
"CME up 4, Sox up 7!"
Hey they called the Sox game because of bad weather?? WHAT WEATHER?.
I meant to post this yesterday...Tony Esposito R.I.P.A record 15 shutouts in his rookie season!
I'm telling you. Due to CMEs weakness. I shorted everything. Well a couple of factors. But CME did make me wonder even more. Its not the 1st time. Don't know how that works.

It looks like the broker read the opening orders backwards or upside down…
"Lorenzo - for a moment diverting from comments about ""Life without Sox"". Of course I mean the White Sox. With the Chinese crackdown on education stocks and whatever is threatening their sovereignty, paranoia - appears the USA is the bastion of safety. The trouble of transacting anywhere or investing anywhere - that is having money parked anywhere, banking anywhere - is this: will the other party own up to a Stock transaction, a futures or option position? Will confiscation ensue? How many countries have nationalized assets overnight? Gaddafi of Libya did, Maduro of Venezuela did. In March of this year Tal education, a Chinese publicly traded company was trading at $90.00, They provide k-12 tutoring. Was super profitable. The stock is trading at $5.00 now. The Chinese government decided to ban educational training institutions. Overnight restriction - poof. The CME is 100% SAFETY guaranteed. Best hub for trading anything. Unrelated - these 3.5% ten year treasuries trading at 1.2% - when will price discovery be unbleached there? S&P in 2001 traded at 1,140 - now at 4,400. Ten year treasuries were at 6.5% in 2001. Now at 1.25% - Load up short for a move to 0.8% How do I contact Musk for a ticket to Mars? 'nough said."
The market tell. CME. It has a nose for it .
A seven dollar rally today makes a bullish engulfing candle. Not too much to ask.Or Cease throws a no hitter. Which is more likely.

"CME nor any other publicly traded company is allowed to comment on buyout rumors other than of course to deny them.

I'm thinking that there is a deal going on and I for one am not happy about it."

If it's anything like the past it'll top off at the end of the year maybe January. Who knows... We'll see... Best of luck everyone."""""""
"Sox win! 300, please put 69 on the board."
Don't know if this was a formality or not but CME did get the recommendation for SOFR to be the benchmark in place of LIBOR. Good thing. Ponz.

"The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to allow the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds to start trading next week, a landmark victory for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought permissions from Wall Street’s top regulator, according to a person familiar with the matter.Specifically, the person said the SEC isn’t likely to block the ETFs proposed by ProShares and Invesco, which are based on futures contracts and were filed under mutual fund guidelines that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks offer investors significant protection."
