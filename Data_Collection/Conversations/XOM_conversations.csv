Exxon Mobil Q3 total revenue $73.79 bln vs. $46.20 bln a year ago
$6.8B net profit with $70 b/oil in Q2. Then in Q4 we are looking at $10B net profit at least with $83 oil. With $10B+ net profit/quarter and a PE of 10 XOM should be trading at $400B+ market cap or $100/share already
"At a hearing in Washington, executives from major oil companies including Irving, Texas-based Exxon push back on claims by certain groups that they waged some sort of ""disinformation"" campaign regarding fossil fuels' role in climate change. ""Like many public policy debates, it should not be surprising that there are competing views about how best to address the risks of climate change,"" says Exxon CEO Darren Woods. ""But it would be a mistake to equate such policy disagreements with promotion of climate 'disinformation.'"" Woods says the fact that Exxon supported certain climate policies, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax and adherence to the Paris Agreement, while opposing others ""is not tantamount to promoting climate disinformation."""
"Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) boosted its quarterly dividend by one cent.The company said Wednesday its board declared a cash dividend of 88 cents per share, payable on December 10. The fourth-quarter dividend is up form 87 cents per share paid in the third quarter of 2021.""Through its dividends, the corporation has shared its success with its shareholders for more than 100 years and has increased its annual dividend payment to shareholders for 39 consecutive years,"" Exxon said."
"Exxon quarter report is what I hoped for, profit enough to cover capital investment, debt reduction, share buying planning in 2022, and reduce carbon emission on target. Great job Exxon, I am happy that I switch from BP, Shell to Exxon. :-))"
"Two key points—AWESOME QUARTER!! • ExxonMobil’s 2021 capital program is expected to be near the low end of the $16 billion to $19 billion range. In the fourth quarter, the board of directors will formally approve the corporate plan, with capital spending anticipated to be in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion annually. • During the quarter, the company paid down gross debt by an additional $4 billion. Year to date, ExxonMobil has reduced gross debt by $11 billion, and improved the total debt to capital ratio to 25%. The company expects to manage debt within a range of 20% to 25%, ensuring a strong, investment-grade credit rating."
"My bad, though I was spot on with $12B in cash how I got to that number was amazingly wrong. Unfortunately I have been listening and believing management, a HUGE mistake. No they don't produce 4m bpd in liquids 78% of oil, they only produce about 2.3m bpd of oil. Further, a big chunk of that is priced in WTI not Brent which interestingly is a benefit before the Brent priced oil is trailing the market price by a lot more than the WTI.So now, thanx to Joe, that I have the real numbers (still have no idea how to get to them from the press release) we can make some better predictions going forward I hope."
Now there's a proposal to tax stock buybacks. Good grief. How about looking into decreasing wasteful spending.
Has XOM recovered the losses that it sustained during the pandemic even the increase in crude oil prices since the beginning of the year?
"I am not saying this is gonna happen...but here is a what if: petroleum based transportation becomes politically untenable. Fuel prices skyrocket while volumes sold decreases. Exploration diminishes. What does XOM do? Do the pay back capital to shareholders, or do they pivot and become a green energy leader?"
The more Congress leans on Big Oil the higher the price will go.
"Thanks to Joe's link I have been digging into the prices. It looks like I get very close to their average price for WTI, Brent and US natural gas if I take the average price from the 16th in the month prior to the Q to the 15th of the last month of the Q. Unfortunately I don't have that data for the EU LNG spot prices but they are going to be confounded with the tying to Brent. A guess at that would be its an average between EU LNG spot prices and a 10th of Brent as they gave us Q3 EU LNG prices average of $10.81, Brent at $73.47 and their price at $9.03. So if you took 1/10th of Brent and averaged it with EU LNG you would get $9.08 which looks real close. So my guess is that is what the formula likely looks like though your guess is as good as mine.So we only have 10/29 and are missing the data till 12/15/21 but we can assume with stable WTI, Brent and gas prices the current average from 9/16-10/29 will only increase. So given that here are the first guesses at Q4 pricesNA WTI realized $75.57 up almost $8 compared to Q3World Brent realized $72.39 up almost $7.50 compared to Q3NA nat gas realized $4.65 up almost $1.32 compare to Q3EU LNG is the wild card because I don't have historical data but recently it traded at $20+ so lets just take the average between the Q2 price and that for a guess $15.41 (it is likely higher) and Brent at $81.39 so taking a tenth of Brent and averaging $15.41+$8.14 = $11.77 or $2.74 higher than Q3.Oil is 60% NA, Nat Gas is 60% world, so we get roughly a $7.70 increase in the price of oil compared to Q3 and about $2.20 increase in natural gas.So we are talking about +$2.2B from natural gas and maybe $216m times $7.7 or $1.66B from oil, add then up apply a 25% tax rate and we get roughly $3B more cash to the bottom line at this stage. Oil and gas prices are much higher than the average predictions to date, so there is upside from that.Analysts need to raise their estimates by at least $0.75 over Q3 so we are talking $2.30-$2.35 right now as likely, there may be some increased charges for maintenance but that can't be that much."
"If you look at the price realization data on the last page of the report, you can see that crude prices only went from Crude ($/b) Q2 $63.29 to Q3 $67.62. I think that's an indication that there is a significant lag in the prices Exxon is getting vs the market and future quarters will be much higher because we're now over $80 per barrel."
Looks like stock buyback 2% tax will be included in the administration’s social spending bill. Probably not a good incentive for investors.
"Personally, I wish XOM would pay out a special dividend instead of buying back shares. Management always seems to have a knack for buying back shares at and near the highs of the stock price. I don't see why this time will be any different. Pay us the money and if we want to buy more shares with it we can do it if and when we see fit. I know I can time my purchases better than management, having owned this for over 30 years, and seen them in action. Management should stick to running an oil company, not timing the stock market."
"This may not bode well for XOM""s earnings.U.S.-listed shares of Royal Dutch Shell(RDS/A) were falling more than 4% in premarket trading Thursday after the oil major missed third-quarter profit forecasts, citing damage caused by Hurricane Ida in the U.S.The U.K.-listed company, which is under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb'sThird Point to break itself up, had flagged earlier this month it would take a $400 million hit to earnings because of the prolonged outage.Shell posted third-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.1 billion which were short of the $5.31 billion analysts were expecting and down from $5.5 in the second quarter."
"So CVX gave us a hint at how long the time period is that they have been selling crude ahead of time. 1st, this months Brent contract which expires on the last Thursday of the month is for delivery 2 months ahead. Then you have the issue of getting paid.So for Q3 6/20/21 would be really the last price they could have squeezed into shipping in Q3. To get down to $58, $58.47 you actually have to look at the average price from 10/1/20 thru 6/30/21, so 3 quarters worth to get that price.Using that range we can estimate that Q4 the average price will increase to roughly $68 in Q4. That would be $10 more, which would be about $2.5B more cash throw in another $1-2B for the spike in natural gas and Q4 should see cash at roughly $16B."
$10B buyback at avg cost of $70/share buys back about 3% of outstanding shares.....seems like better ways to drive shareholder value. Am I missing something?
"I was expecting like 67$ with this after earnings, not 64.50$. But in other news TSLA is at 1100$ with a similar earnings per share. I get it has 4x the amount of outstanding shares but it also has 4x the profit at a 20th of the price and pays a high dividend."
"Good call on the dividend announcement, the right amount just in time. XOM needs to pile up cash (buy back shares) and payoff debt so they can finance their own CAPEX going forward."
"XOM will continue to do well. There are 3 trillion dollars of investment in oil and refining. Since the recent government shift to electric cars, the investment will need to be recaptured at a faster rate. This will insure higher oil prices and XOM profits. One day liberals will wake up with their electric cars costing more than gasoline cars and wonder what happen."
…….We already know that Xoms next earning are going to be even better then this one because that one was based on 60-70 oil…..We could easily see Xom go up 50-100% in the next year….
Exxon will purchase $10 billion of shares of it's own stock over the next two years. This is huge. She's going much higher.
The most important thing we learned to day was in the CVX report which says they only got $58 for oil in Q3. Anyone check the price of oil lately? Looks like over the next year we will see a massive increase in revenue for oil companies as they actually realize these high oil prices in their earnings 3 to 4 quarters after we see the latest quotes (which are for delivery in 2 months time by the way and XOM gets paid on delivery plus some days I am sure).
"Ok, so we stick to the playbook. Hug 65 today, go sideways after, and ramp up into dividend time 12/10 to frontrun the passive reinvestment crowd. Rinse and repeat. Fine by me, I'm in no rush. If people want cheap energy, why don't they try producing some cheap energy? See how that works out"
I'm glad to hear about the buybacks...but the Ds are putting a tax on buybacks in their spending bill. How will that affect XOM?
The green thing to do is cap oil and gas production. Let price rise to $200/bbl. Hike the dividend again. Green investors will love XOM.
The announcement of the buyback to me signals that XOM IS BACK. People looking at only one earnings report for a 3 month period are short sighted. XOM trades to a discount to Chevron right now because the two companies are in different places on their strategies. I do think though that XOM will eventually gain on CVX as their strategy starts to pay off.I think this energy crisis and high inflation will persist longer than expected. So where do you put money? The highly valued tech stocks who are now starting to falter because of the current economic conditions? Maybe XOM isn’t your pick but I do think that putting your money in a commodity stock is the better choice right now.
From CC: XOM average oil equivalent PPB for the Q is $67; fair to say the next Q is $5-10 more. Expect ~ $10 PPS rise accordingly. CVX is only 10% away from 5-year Hi. For XOM this would put it at >$80
"Haha, Moody's about to eat some crow... From their March downgrade of XOM: 'ExxonMobil's large increase in debt in 2020 and accompanying deterioration in financial leverage metrics following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic looks unlikely to be fully reversed in the next few years,"" said Pete Speer, Moody's Senior Vice President. ""The company is prioritizing debt reduction through capital spending restraint and free cash flow generation going forward, but by maintaining its large dividend the progress will be slow and subject to the uncertainties regarding commodity prices, downstream earnings recovery and asset sales."""
"So some thoughts to the real numbers I now have thanks to Joe (not Brandon)!The gab XOM gets for North American production to WTI is shrinking while the gap for international production to Brent is widening. Q4 looks like we will be about $3 lower on WTI but about $9 lower on Brent. Most likely this comes from the fact that XOM uses its own oil to refine and pays near market prices while the Brent it sells internationally and those prices get locked in well ahead of delivery.On natural gas it is very very interesting. NA prices trail spot prices but not by more than 15-20%, indeed in Q1 they were able to take advantage of pricing and beat spot by about 20%. Note these are average spot prices over the quarter.International it is even tighter, there is usually very little difference between what XOM gets and the average spot price. Q3 was different because spot prices rose so aggressively, so here to we were trailing by about 15% by Q3. However, the average price is going up rapidly so natural gas is going to be enormous in Q4 because the spot price average for Europe will be in the high teens I think, that is considerably higher than the $9 XOM got in Q3. This has the potential to increase cash from nat gas alone by maybe as much as $4-5B. I am going with our $1 in nat gas is $1B in a quarter estimate we arrived at before. If XOM's nat gas prices in Q4 are up $10 vs. Q3 and 60% of their nat gas sales are international, boy that can be big bucks."
"XOM.No ROTH, have a SEP. Anything I need to know about a SEP? I have it in dividend-paying equites. I'm not currently putting anymore into it and will not start taking money from it for at least 10 years."
Just read through the earnings report a bit. It stated that they have paid down approximately $4 billion in debt this quarter. A little over $44 million a day. That's solid progress. The business is getting back on solid ground and the balance sheet will get stronger and stronger as we go.
You have to laugh when all of the naysayers continue to talk about XOM. Simple response XOM like many stocks will return to the pre pandemic levels in the 70s or 80s. So will their profits.
"Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. on Friday disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top U.S. shale basin after posting their biggest quarterly profits in years.Latecomers to the west Texas shale fields, both last year slashed shale production and cut drilling as oil demand tanked. They could soon add two rigs each and rev up output, executives said on earnings calls."
So should you invest in your IRA for dividends or not? I'm thinking not. I have just at 600K in an IRA and live off of the dividends in a taxable account. I can live off my taxable account without having to sell any shares. So I think I should just invest for PPS gain in my IRA and slowly move that higher and higher until I need to draw on it in 20 years. I may even go all cash soon and wait for the next crash.
A great end of the week for XOM. Maintaining Aristocrat status and continuing to pay down debt accumulated from the pandemic. Have a great weekend everyone!
"I'm not understanding the logic of blaming oil companies for climate change. Wouldn't you also have to go after car companies, airlines, Santa Fe RR, trucking companies, and every other company that burned fossil fuels? If it wasn't for fossil fuels we'd be living in caves."
"Powerful earnings and cash flow at all the major energy companies this quarter and this will continue for the next several quarters, at least. It's obvious that there is substantial profits to be made in this sector. If some investors prefer to bet on TSLA, bitcoin and other momentum plays, it's their money.At this point, I will ignore the share price and remain focused on fundamentals which are currently very bullish."
I am relieved that it's up in pre-market.V and MA beat earnings yesterday and both stocks tanked afterward. I thought that could happen to XOM too.
