Kuwait oil minister said they could cut the 400k planned production increase
"- XOM -All one needed to do was, buy XOM stock around $52 and change on, Thursday 8/19/21. Hold stock for six days. Sell same XOM stock at $56 and change at, the open of trading day, today, Monday morning 8/30/21. Approximately, 8.5% gain for a six day hold. There was a time, when owning a mutual fund that gave a 8% yield annually, for three to five years running, was a good open-end investment pick. Why bother when you can get a same capital gain in six days.Somebody should write a sitcom, a book, or a song called. ""Buy, Sell, Hold"". High Drama and Humorous all at the same time. Sitcom could have characters like those from ""Seinfeld"" and ""Big Bang Theory"". Book could be written similar to ""The Big Short"". Song could be composed like the ballad ""The Gambler"" by Kenny Rodgers, lyrics such as ""Every gambler knows, that the secret to survivin', is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep"".It's not the old adage ""Buy on bad news, sell on good news"". It's more like kick them when they're down. Sooner or later this will change. Increased profits, less debt, and the need for good products will catch up. ExxonMobile has revenues of ~$265M that employs ~75,000 people. As of (June 2020) Wikipedia has ExxonMobile listed as the fifth largest company by revenue in the United States, ahead of, United Health Care and Berkshire Hathaway.Cut and paste; List of largest companies in the United States by revenueHold! Long!"
"EIAoil down 3Mgasoline down 2.2Mdistillates up 600kLooks like a solid draw to me, will check the report when its public later today."
"... Question... When the news talks about OPEC, does that also include Exxon? I know OPEC is made up of countries, but is Exxon a major oil producer within OPEC?"
we can't start the afternoon fade slide this early!... It's noon! ... does everyone go home for the day to get back to The Hamptons to pick up their kids from school?
I’m pulling another 25% of my energy position and going to cvx and an etf. There is something going in that I don’t understand. No reason to have this underperformance and ambiguity of the cause day after day
"Exxon valued at 235bn. Adobe (you know, the one that does stuff with PDFs but doesn't even own the PDF format) valued at 300bn."
LOD close. Terrible action in the energy sector. IWM rolling over also. My IWM short is looking good here.
"One of the things that landed me here was EVs. I rented a Tesla last summer. It was pretty cool to be honest. The self driving and acceleration was fun. I realized it was more of a novelty after a short road trip though. Most of my Tesla stock ended up here. I like the idea, but we're not there yet. Getting to and through CA in a Tesla is tough enough. How's that going to work out in India or Brazil? Sooner or later the market is going to come to terms with reality on this. ESG or not. Go rent one for fun. I told my wife that it was investment research. It turned out to be true."
Sounds like capitulation happening on this board... good for us long term holders ...
"If I had more cash, then I'd buy more XOM at these prices. It's profits are solid and increasing, and share price recovery will follow. Energy sector is trailing the rest of the market, but within 6 - 12 months should fair much better while many tech stock valuations eventually dip/correct and shareholders RUN to value stocks like XOM."
My years in tracking oil prices. The crisis in the middle east will inevitably influence oil price.
How many people here think brent/crude will be up but XOM down because of the hurricane putting stress on it's infrastructure?
Interesting price action for crude when Katrina hit which was 16 years to the day. On last close of trading before Katrina hit 8/28 crude was 67.50. Did not see this high again until mid January of 2006. By 9/11 it was down to 63.00Bottoming @ 56 in mid November. Will be interesting to watch. With Powel at the helm I would imagine we see opposite trend this time.
"Damnnnnn.oil stocks allways redd. 98,000,000 million barrels a day used.What the he'll does wall street want????????"
"Three months ago 2022 full year EPS estimates were $4.3 and the share price justifiably hovered around $60. Since then, 2022 full year EPS estimates have been steadily climbing and is currently at $4.87 and likely heading higher. If you wait for the warm and fuzzies you will be too late. This time and every time."
"I'm beginning to consider pulling out of oil. Not because of the price decline as of late. Stocks rise and fall. I just wonder whether oil as a whole is more part of the past than the future (which is quite apparently the case). I heard a radio interview in which a scientist who researches batteries said that there's no reason why airplanes couldn't also be run by batteries, if they only could find a way to make them lighter."
Not much resistance on the daily chart till 58.00. This gap up is very bullish.
"XOM was around $54 in Feb. Now it's $54 in Aug. Still, it's much better than around $32 a year ago. And with growth potential. So why worry? I'm happy with it."
"My understanding is that it takes 60 barrels of oil on top of what it takes to make an ICE to make an EV.Doing some back of the envelope calculations here, a Toyota Corolla gets 40 mpg, and there are about 40 gallons of fuel in a barrel.So your Tesla has to make it to 96,000 miles before it covers the additional embodied carbon over a Corolla getting 40 mpg. And right now, in pure accounting terms (not economic terms accounting for R&D), your best bet for reducing CO2 emissions may be to buy a gas-powered Toyota Corolla.I'm not saying individuals should not be supporting EVs. I'm not saying these cars aren't viable.I'm saying we still need oil and natural gas, and I'm not sure EV 1.0 is going to reduce oil consumption.The passionate greenies need to really figure out a way to recycle the lithium in the batteries, to the point that the battery packs are valuable even when they need to be recycled.The best way to encourage conservation-- and also support the EV industry-- is for the greenies to support a fairly consistent and predictable $80-90 oil, assuming that it doesn't cause the western oil industry to drill more wells."
"A question on the bull case. If this is a hedge against inflation as commodity prices go up: I don't see it, given that this is considerably lower now than it was in January 2020.If this is a bet on higher oil prices - oil was cheaper in March, when this was $62, than it is now with Exxon at $55. If this is a hedge against the general overvalued stock market which is filled with 50-500 PE stocks crashing, I don't see it. This follows the S&P down every single day the S&P is down - by a larger volume than the S&P. Even if the S&P is being brought down by companies that have nothing to do with oil - a 0.1% drop in the S&P is an immediate 1%-1.8% off Exxon, regardless of oil price movement that day. Note our stock price now is lower than it was when the S&P was 10% lower. If Exxon does not move up with oil - and it constantly moves down when the S&P goes down - what is the bull case?What is the bull case for holding this?"
"Depending on XOM Baton Rouge's refinery... we will likely see 1.5-2.3Mbpd shuttered for a 2-3day stretch... really interesting timing with the end of summer approaching. Some impact to oil as well, but less of a 'percentage impact'... coincidentally, OPEC+ meeting, China no more Delta, and US COVID turning the corner... I'd speculate that the energy sector may be able to get up off the floor here really soon... especially with NG going vertical (not just US, look at Europe and especially Asia for the winter). GS may prove smarter than us all if oil hits $80 by the end of September."
Lots of crude and gas production (and LOTS of refining capacity too) on the path of hurricane Ida. Companies have cut 91% of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico (1.6m b/d) and 85% of nat gas output.Refining so far is cut 2.1 mbpd.Not sure how this will affect things for $XOM. Oil and gas prices will probably increase. The East Coast will definitely get higher gas prices.
Whose going to be watching oil futures at 6 tonight?
"WTI's weekly chart shows a ""Golden Cross"" - Only done that TWICE in 20 years!It is indicative of 20% to 50% oil price rally in the horizon.""A golden cross occurs when an asset’s shorter-term moving average crosses above its longer-term moving average and is broadly seen as a signal of further upside.""$OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPGSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/oil-has-only-done-this-twice-in-20-years-it-could-mean-a-50-percent-rally.html"

"That fade at the close was fantastic, even by XOM standards. To fade that far into the red on a day that oil & the overall market are both up 0.4%-0.8%. Nice."
"So I was driving past some gas stations in town today and noticed their prices are back to peak levels. Maybe this is just the pre Labor Day price hike but it makes it pretty clear that the new pricing power from inflation is going to make it much less likely that once prices go up they will come back down again. This means that XOM will likely have much better refining margins and the half of their profits that come from end product sales for every $1 increase in Brent are likely to remain from the higher earlier prices.Because Q3 oil sales were likely already in the bag by the end of July odds are very strong Q3 will be a barn burner. How strong Q4 will be remains to be seen but the recent $10 drop in Brent from peak levels might not all come from the bottom line, so people may well be under estimating XOM's profitability in Q4, especially if they hedged well. Remember hedging doesn't always cost you profits, sometimes it maintains them, which is the purpose after all."
………..WTI currently 69.25…..Crude 69.40 both Elevated….Prices are going up for now……Remember OPEC wants the prices high they will want to keep the supply the same or a slight increase to Appease the group……
XOM should be bought because global supply is structurally diminished while demand stays relatively intact. NOT because a hurricane slammed the gulf.
"Not a 'chartist', but... we're bouncing off of the 20dma and gaining a slight amount of RSI momentum (at least from previous week lows). Would like to see this open above $56.16, tick over 50 on the RSI and move toward the upper bounds of the BB. Reasonable that with solid market tailwinds (macro/micro) that we could push toward $58 by the end of the week... outside of some nagging 'delta concerns'... the market seems to be 'constructive' on the energy sector right now. GL all, but if I had to guess which way the wind is blowing this week... 'UP'. EIA reports will be funky the next couple of weeks with Ida, and OPEC just needs to keep the market convinced that they were accurate in their demand expectations moving into the end of the year/22 (no change to output increase of 400k). I jumped on some more Nov Calls last week... so maybe I'm just biased?"
Basically looked like no storm effect on price premarket. Just recovering some of the option expiration fade at the end of the day Friday. Let’s hope the degenerates can resist weekly options this week. It’s a broadly good thing that a major event like this hasn’t caused major damage to Xom facilities. The further supply reductions in crude should be a small positive in the next few weeks so long as refining gets back up and going quickly in BR
"Someone explain to me why to pick Exxon over Shell right now? Shell paying back debt at insane speed due to dividend cut and will add to buy-backs. Exxon seems to be loaded with equal debt but has to pay out so much more to shareholders.Got 2000 Exxon, 1000 Shell and 500 OneOk in portfolio."
Only thing I can figure is big money sees a slow demand ahead for the fall.
"- ExxonMobil -Some good, long hold news here. Motley Fool article, attached.Pay attention to ExxonMobil management style, especially item 3.Key Points...1. Global demand for oil is expected to continue rising in the coming decade.2. ExxonMobil's earnings over the past 10 years have been on a downward trend.3. The energy giant's debt level has risen significantly, but management is working to reduce it.1. The International Energy Agency estimates that the global demand for oil could rise to 104.1 million barrels per day in 2026 from an estimated 96.5 million barrels per day in 2021. It expects market demand to start plateauing from 2030 onwards. Road transport accounted for 60% of oil demand growth in the last decade. But a shift toward greater use of electric vehicles is looming.2. ExxonMobil stock has generated steady dividend income for millions of investors over the years, so it isn't surprising that it still has many fans, despite its lackluster share price performance. Over the last 10 years, ExxonMobil stock has generated a total return of 11.6%, compared to 372% for the S&P 500 Index. However, the stock largely outperformed the broader market in the 2000-2015 timeframe.3. The company has reduced its debt by $7 billion since the end of 2020. Its cost-cutting efforts have saved it $4 billion in structural expenses over the last 18 months. It is on track for total savings of $6 billion through 2023. Moreover, it reduced its annual capital expenditures from more than $24 billion in 2019 to $17 billion in 2020. Management now expects capital expenditures to be near the lower end of its 2021 guidance range of $16 billion to $19 billion. In short, it is moving in the right direction.Referencing item 3. In order to attract real ""Big Money"", the balance sheets need to read, ""Less Debt"". It looks better. Remember, perception is everything, especially in the corporate world.Right now this stock is (frenzied) being traded. Investors are needed for (smooth, steady, slow) growth.An example; look at a long time frame chart. BigChart 1985 through 2021, attached.Note high volume and fluctuation increases (frenzied) during bad times. Note low volume and fluctuation decreases (smooth, steady, slow) growth during good times. Volume tells its own story.Look at points in time, Market dump in 1987. 9/11 in 2001 through 2003, Subprime loans in 2008. Currently, Covid-19 virus in 2020.Hold!

"Been long on hydrocarbons since covid crash. What a gift, generational contrarian opportunity, my only regret is not having more powder to capitalize on it. Long as so strong on hydrocarbons!"
Just under performing cvx again… I guess still suffering from the exclusion from the Dow… or the refusal of management to institute a buyback. The buyback is crucial and should be tuned to compensate for divy payment amounts to maintain share price.
Oil needs to close at these level to signal a true reversal in the recent bearish trend. If that happens XOM will begin to follow it up
"$SPY is up, Brent oil is up, and $XOM is down. That's what we call a day that ends in y here.there is no bullish thesis to this stock if it follows Brent and market down, but never follows them up."
"Well... I am back in the club! I just bought back in at $55.35... I was lucky to get out at $64, and I think I've waited long enough oh, and I believe that Exxon is headed north from here."
