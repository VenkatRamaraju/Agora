don't follow the s&p up yesterday. but definitely follow it down today. submit and close under your 200 dma. make tom lee cry
"Looks like yahoo's earnings estimates are so out of date that they are worthless. Oh well, guess we find a better source.So from Nasdaq we are up to $1.43 for Q3 and $1.30 for Q4 for total 2021 earnings of $4.48 which puts us at roughly a 13 P/E. This for a stock that pays a 6% dividend! So if you think this can go much lower, what exactly are you smoking. Note none of these analysts are factoring in their new production that is coming online by 2025 and reducing their break even costs. So if we can do $4.50 now with over $10 lower break even costs what will 2025 earnings look like? Right much much higher. That means a huge growth P/E is warranted. This stock is simply massively undervalued."
All I have to say is brace yourself for a few more weeks bad COVID news. The deluge of new vaccinations due to the Delta scare won't be felt until September because of the lag between inoculation and viral protection. That doesn't mean Exxon isn't making a ton of money at $70 crude it just means sentiment will depress market value until then. We'll see significant appreciation from here in mid September when COVID becomes less of a story.
I’m pulling another 25% of my energy position and going to cvx and an etf. There is something going in that I don’t understand. No reason to have this underperformance and ambiguity of the cause day after day
Need to close over $54.31 so this is not just another fill the gap on the way down exercise.
Wow! Category 4 hurricane headed for New Orleans direct hit.
"Oil is not a favorite investment with democrats in office period, they'd like nothing more than to end the oil business forever in their utopian socialist pipedream world."
Longer dated calls not moving as much as one might expect. Yet. So those are being sold on this move up. Perhaps some buy/write happening or just an expected pullback later in the day.

glad I opened my energy play to incorporate more than just XOM - picked up a heavy load of FANG & PSX shares which were also up nicely today.
Best to hold XOM and not watch CNBC!
"Fake and fabricated Chinese data today bring oil price down by $2 today. Very clever strategy to put out weak refinery output and weak import data, just to get prices down and fill up storage with cheap off the book Iran, Venezuela imports. So easy to manipulate oil prices. In reality, Saudis are increasing prices and other gulf countries are following their leads. They know the real figures. Oil will spike, when inventory data reveals surplus or withdrawals.Delta concerns is another over blown reality since no lock downs taking place in Asia. There are some travel restrictions for certain countries but that was always there since last year. Situations has dramatically improved in India, Indonesia, Brazil etc Daily infections down more significantly since Vaccines and previously infected cases are immunized. India getting closer to herd immunity shortly."
Well Sleepy Joe has now upped the number of forces heading to Afghanistan from 3k to 5K.Just what is this guy thinking? or does he?
……….with the Labor Day holiday coming right up and looking at WTI and Crude now both are climbing back up the the green ladder.we should have a good week ahead and then you get the dividend which should increased the Stock price….Good luck 
"Well, my plan is working really well, sell at 11am, buy back at 4pm..."
"So I was driving past some gas stations in town today and noticed their prices are back to peak levels. Maybe this is just the pre Labor Day price hike but it makes it pretty clear that the new pricing power from inflation is going to make it much less likely that once prices go up they will come back down again. This means that XOM will likely have much better refining margins and the half of their profits that come from end product sales for every $1 increase in Brent are likely to remain from the higher earlier prices.Because Q3 oil sales were likely already in the bag by the end of July odds are very strong Q3 will be a barn burner. How strong Q4 will be remains to be seen but the recent $10 drop in Brent from peak levels might not all come from the bottom line, so people may well be under estimating XOM's profitability in Q4, especially if they hedged well. Remember hedging doesn't always cost you profits, sometimes it maintains them, which is the purpose after all."
$ 70 next qtr look at the streets full of cars where is the pandemie gone? more an endemie now. massiv energy consumption will follow.
"So according to this site the average price of Brent so far this year is $66.88. So we are now slightly below the average for the year. In reality XOM likely gets a trailing 2 or 3 month average price for a quarter, so you really need to look at like 11/1/20 thru 4/30/21 to get the average price for Q1 and Q2 and likely 5/1/21 thru 7/31/21 for what their Q3 average likely will be. Note they hedge so they can be lower.That gets you $57.19 for H1/21 and $72.06 for Q3. Now they hedge so likely they didn't get the full benefit in each quarter. Judging by their claims they are cash flow break even at $50 paying the dividend and CapEx they would have had about a $6B surplus so far this year, that would be $52 which would fit with some hedging.Now it seems to me Q3 is going to be very good even with these recent price declines, so I think they will beat earnings. How well they then do in Q4 remains to be seen but clearly with the drop in crude things will not be so rosy. Assuming Brent stays flat we could be looking at roughly a ~$67 in Q4. Of course here their hedging might actually be helping. If they were smart they likely hedged some earlier this year as we broke above $50, then $60 and then $70. At high prices they might have well said let's lock in 2021 so we can reduce debt and mitigate downside. So Q4 could turn out to be a surprise as well."

Two consecutive close at the low days. Increasing volume… get away! It’s going down hard and I don’t think we know why… yet.
time to buy is now
…………… BRAKING NEWS……….. Xom is still undervalued at 54.94.So do yourself a big favor and BUY NoW……..Ride it to 100 in the future and get 6% on your cash….
"Three months ago 2022 full year EPS estimates were $4.3 and the share price justifiably hovered around $60. Since then, 2022 full year EPS estimates have been steadily climbing and is currently at $4.87 and likely heading higher. If you wait for the warm and fuzzies you will be too late. This time and every time."
One might panic and think because of delta we are in free fall mode. The other way to look at it is before delta the economy was on the way to overheating which would forced the fed to raise rates and hence crash the market. Instead we are in just a pause onto a more sustainable growth tract
All I need to know is that xom is making money. It's making a lot of money right now. I'd love to be adding at the current price.
U.S energy sector is oversold and undervalued...This covid situation is a blessing and we get to buy up crucial undervalued assets at a cheap price... Once the pandemic ends we are going to see a true explosion of economic activity with an artificially restricted supply due to no new wells being explored
"Exxon valued at 235bn. Adobe (you know, the one that does stuff with PDFs but doesn't even own the PDF format) valued at 300bn."
"Wait for a gigantic fall as all stocks cannot go up indefinitely. However, the perfect storm has brewed. Labor Day weekend, oil refinery closure, short supply in gasoline, crude oil dancing on the edge due to Middle East tensions, and dividend reinvestment all within a short time. Congrats! Holding XOM long until this event will see a surge in crude oil prices. Whether XOM will surge is questionable. Why not check out AMC, Gamestop, and other indoor venues reopening. If you are after over 7% dividend, how about another stock? One of the dividend kings and queens."

Natty Gas prices...whoa! Wonder what's going on there.
Oil in the cards to 100?! I think so
have taken the opportunity to buy more.. its not only an oil company they have a good future so im in for many years to come!
"Just a reminder""The stock market is a device for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient.""Daddy Buffett"
..........Crude up.....over 70.....That didn’t take too long best of all.....XOM........Green out of the Gate...go XOM Go Strong and Long!!!!
CNBC talking heads have mentioned energy is cheap here multiple times today. I told you last week that this what they would do. Energy with out performing secto over the next month or two. And it can run fast
Going back to 60.
We need to get this stock above $80
Id consider selling short term if I saw a top of around 80. Then id sit back and wait for another buy opportunity. Im patient I can wait a couple of years of collecting dividend until then
Only a couple weeks if not soon till $52.00. Looking to establish half of a position and then the other half @ $50.00-$51.00Let’s go!!
Port of New Orleans received no damage....
Just under performing cvx again… I guess still suffering from the exclusion from the Dow… or the refusal of management to institute a buyback. The buyback is crucial and should be tuned to compensate for divy payment amounts to maintain share price.
"I saw something at a used car dealership - cheap hydrogen fuel cell cars in California! They are cheaper than regular cars! Less than $15k. Hydrogen is produced by steam reformation of natural gas methane. Oil companies are transitioning even in Saudi Arabia to produce hydrogen from natural gas. So oil companies are not going away. In fact, I see adoption of hydrogen fuel cell cars just because more people are renting homes and do not have an electrical outlet to charge their electric cars. That and they do not have $100k to drop on a car that needs $5k in batteries when they need to be replaced."

"Interesting? Barron's report...BP cut investments in Apple (ticker: AAPL), Chevron (CVX), and Microsoft (MSFT), and more than doubled its stake in Exxon Mobil (XOM) stock. The firm disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"Sort of interesting technicals, CVX held support but trades below its 200 dma now, while XOM fail to get support at the prior low but seems to have bounced off the 200 dma. Normally the 200 dma is a much stronger level of resistance. IWM and XLE all broke below their 200 dma by the way while the S&P looks like it had a nice bounce off of its 50 dma."
Well that was a pretty good day.
…….Goodbye shorts….Cover time!!!!
Lot of short covering happening all over the place today
"Glad to see it was decided that we're still making money, regardless of their games."
"The case for XOM remains strong. Yet it's down 3 pc today (8/19) on heavy volume, 30 mln shares (avg. 22). Trouble in the Middle East normally causes a spike in crude oil, yet it just hit a 3-month low. Is the Delta variant really so scary? Plus the war against oil? Both might hurt the economy and therefore demand. But stagflation isn't a promising environment for a massive, costly transition to renewable-powered electrification. Meanwhile, oil will continue to be essential for global energy needs for a long time, and the green revolution has problems. E.g., ""[R]are earth metals like lithium have been imported almost exclusively from China, which was able to lower its prices enough to monopolize the industry. One of the reasons China could sell lithium so cheaply was because it widely ignored environmental safeguards during the mining process... The trouble with plug-in hybrids (and electric cars, too) is that electricity isn't always cleaner than gasoline. More than 45 percent of electricity in the U.S. is generated by coal-powered plants. [And] if a plug-in hybrid charges from coal-generated electricity, it could be responsible for emitting up to 10 percent more greenhouse gasses than a conventional vehicle and up to 60 percent more than a standard hybrid."" https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm"
“U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ANNOUNCES PLANNED SALE OF UP TO 20 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL FROM STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE“
"BEIRUT, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The Lebanese government said on Sunday that it was raising gasoline prices by 66% in a partial reduction of fuel subsidies as it seeks to ease crippling shortages that have brought the country to a standstill.The increase in 95-octane gasoline prices would take effect immediately, the government said in a statement. It follows the state's decision on Saturday to change the exchange rate used to price petroleum products in a bid to ease the shortages.The fuel crisis worsened this month when the central bank said it could no longer finance fuel imports at heavily subsidised exchange rates and would switch to market rates.The government, concerned about the impact of price rises, in a compromise agreed with the central bank on Saturday to raise prices, but by less than the market rate, to allow subsidised imports to resume for now."
Xom outperformed cvx today. Where’s the guy always complaining about that
………..WTI currently 69.25…..Crude 69.40 both Elevated….Prices are going up for now……Remember OPEC wants the prices high they will want to keep the supply the same or a slight increase to Appease the group……

Everything is melting up in AH. Cramer is fired up. Lol. He mentioned CVX and XOM shot up 20 cents. Shorts are in trouble here.

"Someone explain to me why to pick Exxon over Shell right now? Shell paying back debt at insane speed due to dividend cut and will add to buy-backs. Exxon seems to be loaded with equal debt but has to pay out so much more to shareholders.Got 2000 Exxon, 1000 Shell and 500 OneOk in portfolio."
"Fossil fuels are being used up at a rapid pace. The media is jumping on the bandwagon of trying to claim all disasters are due to fossil fuel use (in between their trips on fossil fuel-burning airplanes and luxury SUV rides). In actuality, some things will be positively impacted from an increase in global temperature and some things will be negatively impacted from an increase in global temperature. For example, lizards will be greatly impacted by an increase in global temperature. In my area, the daily temperature varies from 50.5F to 85.3F. A couple decades into the future, the global temperature is expected to rise by +0.3F. This will mean the temperature in my area will then move to a whopping change of 50.8F to 85.6F. Ok, not so whopping. Ok, perhaps lizards won’t even notice the change but are more likely to be run over by one of those SUVs or an oversized sneaker as the overcrowding population of people continues to grow. The amount of increase in global temperature is negligible compared to the range and variation of the temperatures in my region. We are already slightly more than halfway through consuming our accessible supply of oil and natural gas and total fossil fuels. It is going to get more and more scares and more expensive because we are using it at a rapid pace to melt silicon for solar cells and build infrastructure and batteries, etc. All this hype about runaway global warming tries to downplay the finite amount of fossil fuels on earth. At most we can only get a 3C increase in the global temperature from the total available supply of fossil fuels on earth. Due your due diligence.(Also, give this post a thumbsdown if you have no confidence in the administration's ability to keep things in perspective and to address overcrowding and inflation)."

"That fade at the close was fantastic, even by XOM standards. To fade that far into the red on a day that oil & the overall market are both up 0.4%-0.8%. Nice."
we have enough warheads to turn this planet into the sun and your worried about carbon
Looks like Delta has peaked and the worst may be behind us. The rest of the year could be very bullish for XOM.
"EIA report is public, here is my take:14.5M bpd Pre-Covid demand now at 1.085+4.104+9.572 = 14.761M bpd demand is more than backRefining 16.1M well off 17.5M pre-Covid and not coming back,Production 11.4M still well below 13M pre-CovidInventories down 2.6M oil bottom quartile, gasoline well below range, distillates bottom quartile, propane at bottom of range. Inventories are quite tight.Tighter supplies will strengthen pricing."
"The question now will be can Brent set up in this trading range which seems to be about $68 to $78. If this is the new trading range then eventually XOM should appreciate quite nicely from these levels as consistent pricing in that range should even get the stock testing multi year highs in the mid $80's.So we will see, oil bounced again today and the delta variant drop in consumption is more than priced in. If GS is right, we are still paring back world wide inventories by 1M bpd so this is all just fine. Only inventory builds are a concern because they would have to be worked off again post delta but if we can get into 2022 with another 200M barrel draw on the world inventories going into the summer, well it could get really exciting for oil prices then."
"Not a 'chartist', but... we're bouncing off of the 20dma and gaining a slight amount of RSI momentum (at least from previous week lows). Would like to see this open above $56.16, tick over 50 on the RSI and move toward the upper bounds of the BB. Reasonable that with solid market tailwinds (macro/micro) that we could push toward $58 by the end of the week... outside of some nagging 'delta concerns'... the market seems to be 'constructive' on the energy sector right now. GL all, but if I had to guess which way the wind is blowing this week... 'UP'. EIA reports will be funky the next couple of weeks with Ida, and OPEC just needs to keep the market convinced that they were accurate in their demand expectations moving into the end of the year/22 (no change to output increase of 400k). I jumped on some more Nov Calls last week... so maybe I'm just biased?"
We are entering the stage of hurricane season where storms start developing in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The taliban and terrorists are back in charge and heavily armed. The global stage is set for oil to go higher.
"OPEC+'s answer will be sorry but not sorry; we will increase with demand as we lost billions and our oil based economies suffered. We will protect our interests and increase production when demand returns but we will keep prices in the current range. Have a great day. One more thing, Putin and OPEC+ will not capitulate to a White House Public Relations ploy. This is a flash in the pan and Oil prices will remain stable,"

"So what are stock options, a way for the big boys to steal your money and keep the price down at the same time. Let’s not forget, they hold all the cards in this game. It’s not rocket science, here is how it works, you buy dated calls for a premium, the MM control the stock and pocket your premium and even if you do execute the call you make nothing since the stock closes at or near the asking price in which you bought the call, or we’ll below, and they lose nothing. If you want the price to go up, stop buying calls, and then the only way they make money is thru stock appreciation like the common share holder. There is no incentive for them to keep the price beat down. Makes sense right? I am glad you agree."

"Over the next few months the realization of the worlds dependance on fossil fuels will become evident.

"selling this to buy stuff that actually moves with the price of oil. 0.18% is a joke when crude is up over 1%. Buy some PSX, MRO, VLO or anything else. Three times the potential returns in the short term for momentum plays"
"I'm beginning to consider pulling out of oil. Not because of the price decline as of late. Stocks rise and fall. I just wonder whether oil as a whole is more part of the past than the future (which is quite apparently the case). I heard a radio interview in which a scientist who researches batteries said that there's no reason why airplanes couldn't also be run by batteries, if they only could find a way to make them lighter."

"You heard it here first, July job numbers will be big tomorrow, putting a wet blanket on the impact of the Delta variant. Markets will be up, up, up.My business has been a very accurate predictor of the monthly jobs report. We had a record setting July. An even bigger August underway. Full speed ahead on main street.Tune out the noise. The recovery is underway and big boys are using this lateral market movement to accumulate."
"Yeah looks like the support ain't there. Delta will delay the recovery it looks like and we will need to see if OPEC+ does anything about this trend at their Sept. 1 meeting. Till then, enjoy the dividend and write off 2021 as a recovery and hope for 2022.Encouraging is Florida which still has high infection rates but the deaths are plummeting, very interesting given they still have high numbers."
"Permian pure plays are going to benefit heavily from a hurricane making landfall in Louisiana, $FANG is probably the best lean buy here. Oil prices will hop, but XOM won't reap revenue from it"
"XOM was around $54 in Feb. Now it's $54 in Aug. Still, it's much better than around $32 a year ago. And with growth potential. So why worry? I'm happy with it."
"One of the things that landed me here was EVs. I rented a Tesla last summer. It was pretty cool to be honest. The self driving and acceleration was fun. I realized it was more of a novelty after a short road trip though. Most of my Tesla stock ended up here. I like the idea, but we're not there yet. Getting to and through CA in a Tesla is tough enough. How's that going to work out in India or Brazil? Sooner or later the market is going to come to terms with reality on this. ESG or not. Go rent one for fun. I told my wife that it was investment research. It turned out to be true."
"Well we didn't get the nice reversal that would have made today look better than it does but reality is we are oversold and the dividend as well as rebounding oil prices should be giving us some support. Unfortunately some technical resistance levels have broken and now we are basically left to hope the 200 dma holds, given the rebound in oil prices that could well happen. Remember at $66+ Brent XOM is very profitable because that is basically what we had for Brent prices in Q2 and XOM didn't even take full advantage of that.So a 6+% dividend and the stock trading at just under a 12 P/E should really signal we are near a bottom. Where we head from here will depend on Delta, Brent prices and then Q3 earnings. Delta is going to get ugly this fall/winter that seems very likely now, fortunately deaths won't be as bad as last year but it is also abundantly clear more Americans will be dying of Covid in 2021 with the vaccine than died in 2020. 2022 looks much better, especially if we get more people vaccinated."
I told you guys to sell this floater and buy some $FANG

$40 Dollar Stock trying to be a $50 dollar Stock.. Soon to be back in the $40's..
Oil is dead? Lol carter worth got that one wrong it looks like.
"So the EIA report is public here is my spin:Pre-Covid 14.5m bpd now 1.165+4.323+9.333 = 14.821 demand is back in the good old USAInventories propane bottom of 5 yr, distillates 20% of 5 yr, gasoline below 5 yr, oil 25% of 5 year, so inventories are very lean.Net down 3.8M so supplies are continuing to shrink.Refining 16m bpd 1.5m below pre-Covid and that looks more and more like its permanently down 1+m bpd.Production 11.4m bpd 1.6m bpd below pre-Covid slowly ramping back up.This was a solid report showing a continued net 500k a day decline in inventories of product. We continue to whittle away at inventories that are all now at the bottom of the 5 year range. This will support higher gasoline prices and thus also oil prices."
"HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp has begun marketing U.S. shale gas properties as it ramps up a long-stalled program that aims to raise billions of dollars to shed unwanted assets and reduce debt taken on last year.The company has achieved about a third of its three-year, $15 billion sales target. This year, it has received sales proceeds of $557 million through June, and has deals pending valued at more than $2.15 billion."
a gains a gain.
"One thing many might not have thought about for 3rd and 4th QTR earnings is the CapX is going to have to be at least $5Billon+ in each QTR which will double more then double the last two QTRs CapX spending and this will only put us in the low end at $16Billion of their guidance, they need to have an assets sale by 3rd Qtr i feel or earnings will be meh with CapX high"
Assuming no significant changes between now and the middle of next week I have something of substance to add here. You may even see a blip on the chart if you don't blink .
Basically looked like no storm effect on price premarket. Just recovering some of the option expiration fade at the end of the day Friday. Let’s hope the degenerates can resist weekly options this week. It’s a broadly good thing that a major event like this hasn’t caused major damage to Xom facilities. The further supply reductions in crude should be a small positive in the next few weeks so long as refining gets back up and going quickly in BR
"The EIA report is public, here is my take:Pre-Covid 14.5m bpd now 1.114+3.734+9.43 = 14.278m bpdRefining 16.2m bpd about 1.5M below pre-CovidProduction 11.3M about 1.7M below pre-CovidInventories: -642k gasoline below 5 year range, propane at about 5%, distillates at 20% oil at roughly 25%. Gasoline is already tightening and all levels are very low with gasoline likely to decline through December of this year.This report says demand hasn't fully recovered yet but inventories continue to be depleted and gasoline is already well below its 5 yr range. That could look interesting later this year. Refining capacity looks like has been permanently reduced by 1.5M bpd, so it will have a tough time playing catchup. At some point we will need to be importing gasoline as well."
"... crude oil could be $100 a barrel, and Exxon will still be at $55 a share"
"The nation’s top auto safety regulator is now investigating nearly a dozen accidents where a Tesla’s autopilot caused the car to slam into other vehicles, hmmmm."
Surge today.
"Deep down somewhere there i want $XOM going back to $45 and we are using every penny for buybacks. İ am even OK with barrowing for buybacks. İ am talking about buying back 25% of shares, which will save $20B in the next 5 years."
........I have certainly seen this movie before the big boys are still Manipulating the oil stock prices so you give up.......Well there not getting any of my shares.....
"Looks like we'll need sector rotation/renewed interest in the energy sector to push to $60+. With the other sectors being near/at record highs... it would seem as though (pending Delta) that we're in a good spot to finally break through the $64-65 range. Most folks should ignore the daily fluctuations as they are not particularly relevant when evaluating XOM as an investment (vs. a trade). Conduct some research on the various sectors and their performance over the last two months... if energy doesn't get some love in the near term, then it bodes poorly for the market as a whole (correction). Good entry points below $63... of course, my opinion. GL."
Fox news made XOM a top pick today.
So volume is starting to pick up… this is gonna be a big week. Friday we will close over 60
"Damnnnnn.oil stocks allways redd. 98,000,000 million barrels a day used.What the he'll does wall street want????????"

"Millions of electric car batteries will retire in the next decade. What happens to them?A tsunami of electric vehicles is expected in rich countries, as car companies and governments pledge to ramp up their numbers – there are predicted be 145m on the roads by 2030. But while electric vehicles can play an important role in reducing emissions, they also contain a potential environmental timebomb: their batteries.Not only do these batteries require large amounts of raw materials, including lithium, nickel and cobalt – mining for which has climate, environmental and human rights impacts – they also threaten to leave a mountain of electronic waste as they reach the end of their lives."
RIP crude gap up
"Articles like this will become more common in the coming year. Less investment in oil will lead to lower supply, meanwhile, demand is still growing. If a transition into EVs isn't absolutely flawless, the world is going to find itself in a terrible energy bind.https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/African-Oil-Producers-Struggle-To-Raise-Oil-Production-As-Investment-Lags.html"
This reminds me when the government wanted to make tobacco illegal. MO went down to 30 with a 8% div. I don’t have to tell anyone how that worked out. Exxon downsize risk is minimum if you believe crude will stay in the sixties that’s all you need to happen. Close your eyes for only one year. Buy buy buy. Okay
thinking xom will have a hard time staying green today as it was up big yesterday and not showing much of a premarket pop
"Hmph! EIA report is positive with less crude imports, -3 million barrels inventory, -2.2 million barrels gasoline."
Low volume. prob closing under 55 Friday.
Oversold. Way overdone. Should be at least $55.00 next week. Then stabilize and head up from there.
"I know I'm going to get ridiculed for saying this, but this stock is going to pop at any time. It's too bad it probably won't be before a big chunk of my options portfolio expires on Friday causing big losses but I know I'm right. You look at the last 15 minute candle of every single day for the past many days and someone is going in and buying at the end of the day. Granted it is after the fade but someone is going in and buying these shares on sale. I have 3 days for the stock to rise 10% for me to break even. Almost no chance of that happening. I did buy some $56 calls that expire on the 27th. Can we hit $59 by then?"
"Looks like the Bollinger Bands are narrowing, again. Not quite to the same extent as October 20 or April 21... but getting there both moves were 15% plus. I'm not a technicals guy... but wouldn't be surprised if we see a third similar event (15% would put us at $66). Might need a catalyst though too... call it Delta being less of a boogeyman and/or 3Q results. If we don't see a move up by November (and oil stays at ~$70+)... I'm not sure what you could blame other than 'ESG'."
and it's red....
"EIAoil down 3Mgasoline down 2.2Mdistillates up 600kLooks like a solid draw to me, will check the report when its public later today."
……..We will close in the Green it’s a good day……..
Went through hundreds of posts here and I could not find one single post where you trumptards complain about higher oil prices and higher price for gas. I wonder why
Divergences everywhere. Even in options. With VIX near its lows. Options have become very expensive. A big move one way or the other is coming on the indexes.
No volume again. This is an option market chew toy.
Mexico just lost one full quarter of its oil production capacity
Strong Buy
the end of day fade doesn't happen every day and sometimes those options guy loose control of the plan. and sometimes xom moves more than oil. seems like today is setting up to be a good day for the long term small guy...
"Anyone have current news on XOM's collaboration with FCEL to reduce power plant emissions? They've been at this awhile now and while so many have clamored that XOM doesn't do enough, if this technology pans out combined with their carbon-capture plans then I would think XOM catapults to #1 among the majors globally in greenhouse gas emissions."
Talisman took complete control over Afghanistan with the withdrawal of United States Military forces withdrawal. On a positive note means Oil will skyrocket.
"Markets up big. XOM up 0.1%. Long term share holder here, cost basis $60. This is a disaster."
good day slowly going to 70$
"A question on the bull case. If this is a hedge against inflation as commodity prices go up: I don't see it, given that this is considerably lower now than it was in January 2020.If this is a bet on higher oil prices - oil was cheaper in March, when this was $62, than it is now with Exxon at $55. If this is a hedge against the general overvalued stock market which is filled with 50-500 PE stocks crashing, I don't see it. This follows the S&P down every single day the S&P is down - by a larger volume than the S&P. Even if the S&P is being brought down by companies that have nothing to do with oil - a 0.1% drop in the S&P is an immediate 1%-1.8% off Exxon, regardless of oil price movement that day. Note our stock price now is lower than it was when the S&P was 10% lower. If Exxon does not move up with oil - and it constantly moves down when the S&P goes down - what is the bull case?What is the bull case for holding this?"
"The weekly decrease in crude inventories by 3.23 million barrels from a week ago decrease of 447.000 showing steeper draw,s! What's up with this Divergence & sell off..???? Anybody!"

……….I just have this overwhelming feeling when Pre market hits tomorrow morning Xom is going to explode…… to the up side…..1-3+%
100% cash atm
OPEC lowered its 2022 oil demand forecast by like 1.1Million Barrels a day and as soon as this was reported oil took a -1% swing. Everyday it’s something lol
Its glaringly obvious than anything old in terms of stock is not desirable to todays investor
"Oil stocks are to reactive to negative oil prices, going to take $75+ oil to get XOM $60 or higher i feel."
Oversold and Undervalued...Energy makes the world go around...
Right now if you buy at 55.00 you can sell next weeks 55 strike for 1.00. That’s like getting a dividend weekly. Actually better.
The Fast Money crew shunned oil at the end of last week. Big signal that the bottom is in.
LOD close. Terrible action in the energy sector. IWM rolling over also. My IWM short is looking good here.
The hurricane is all hype. We are going to 80! Friday we will close at 60. Gapping up at opening bell over 56. Finally going to have higher than average volume 22-26. Wish I wouldn’t have reduced my position but oh well. I got out up a bit
…….WTI and Crude Elevated….Middle East in Turmoil…Xom is going to be a bright bright green all day…….Long!!!
Nice retest of the lows $52.10 yesterday $52.11 today! XOM holding up better on the charts than CVX likely because of the juicy dividend. When you get a weak market like this some people like to run for cover in dividend payers.
I'm pretty good at catching bottoms and I loaded up about 1k this past week... up we go
Its gonna be huge. Every division executing like mad.
"My understanding is that it takes 60 barrels of oil on top of what it takes to make an ICE to make an EV.Doing some back of the envelope calculations here, a Toyota Corolla gets 40 mpg, and there are about 40 gallons of fuel in a barrel.So your Tesla has to make it to 96,000 miles before it covers the additional embodied carbon over a Corolla getting 40 mpg. And right now, in pure accounting terms (not economic terms accounting for R&D), your best bet for reducing CO2 emissions may be to buy a gas-powered Toyota Corolla.I'm not saying individuals should not be supporting EVs. I'm not saying these cars aren't viable.I'm saying we still need oil and natural gas, and I'm not sure EV 1.0 is going to reduce oil consumption.The passionate greenies need to really figure out a way to recycle the lithium in the batteries, to the point that the battery packs are valuable even when they need to be recycled.The best way to encourage conservation-- and also support the EV industry-- is for the greenies to support a fairly consistent and predictable $80-90 oil, assuming that it doesn't cause the western oil industry to drill more wells."
...........I like how Jeffries calls XOM a (value trap)...The stock price since October last year has Double and now almost Doubled and if that’s not enough the high Yielding dividend that was maintained through negative oil.With this new Administration XOM is worth up to 100 a share so we are Undervalued big time........Patience is the key to success.
I meant cannot believe ExxonMobil is not at $80
"Jul-27-2020 Brent: $43.30 $XOM: $43.43 covid new cases: 62k,Oct-26-2020 Brent: $37.46 $XOM: $34.16 covid new cases: 71kJan-08-2021 Brent: $55.99 $XOM: $45.46 covid new cases: 260k (peak)Jul-27-2021 Brent: $74.78 $XOM: $57.77 covid new cases: 52kAug-26-2021 Brent: $71.07 $XOM: $54.71 covid new cases: 152kMy guess one month ago was covid cases to peak at ~200k this week.Let's see if OPEC delays the production hikes on Sep-1 (unlikely but I think that would have been wise)."
"So you have to laugh at how analysts continuously ignore the cost cutting and lowering of break even costs XOM has been explaining to them quarter after quarter. Now granted, if a company says we are going to do $6B in cost savings you might be justified in waiting to see if they can deliver (so far they have done $4B and $2B more to go). However, when the company tells you its break even costs is going to drop from $50 Brent to $35 Brent because of the much cheaper to produce oil coming out of new developments, well isn't that something you can take to the bank well before it happens? I mean they have been pumping oil out of Guyana now for a while and as they add capacity at a lower break even price that will clearly lower XOM's costs. So with the development clearly telegraphed how come analysts can't figure that into future earnings expectations now? I mean does anyone really think XOM is going to earn less money in 2023 with all of that cost cutting than it is going to earn in 2021?"
Not much resistance on the daily chart till 58.00. This gap up is very bullish.
"People really need to stop worrying about the stock price movement. The reality is this is a 2025 investment and till then the lower the stock price is the more shares you can buy. By 2025 you get 3 potential upsides to earnings:1) Company cost cutting that will take their break even down over $10 Brent2) Reversion to mean on the trailing 10 year price of Brent which is about $74 (so consistently higher Brent prices)3) A lack of CapEx in the industry that results in a massive shortfall of production by 2025 rocketing oil prices to new all-time highs over $150If any of those three happen by 2025 the company will be throwing off massive amounts of cash and that will mean a larger dividend, buybacks and of course investments in the future which may include renewables. All of that will offset any declines in the oil business form green initiatives taking away demand, something that might not even happen by 2030."
Two of the largest oil booms in the USA were under Jimmy Carter and Obama.
"I thought oil stocks were being shorted for the usual price manipulation but I know wonder whether there are ""climate-associated"" forces/entitites that are actively trying to hurt investment in this field. Price action doesn't make sense."
the whole taliban take over will spread. expect the return of isis in iraq and syria by next year and oil prices to skyrocket with instability in the region
im shocked this stock has dropped like this. how?!

Bahahaha Markets having a taper tantrum cause Fed might be giving away less fake money.It's like a child not getting his bubble gum. Grown ups will buy this dip.
I think we could be pretty much at the bottom unless oil goes below $60
They are loading puts in them after hour window on the indexes. Maybe it’s “come back in September and sell away”.
Well... I'd definitely say that the energy sector has corrected? We're down over 20% from the June high... with improving fundamentals and conditions... these prices made sense at the beginning of the year. Nobody ever accused the market of being rational...
Yessssss. Another down day for 19th Century XOM!
So... what are thoughts for API/EIA? Will it even matter? I'm guessing 2M draw on crude (1.5M at Cushing) and maybe 4M gas draw too...
EIA reports sends oil down and oil stocks up lol.....
"Two of Europe’s major Energy companies had profits hurt because of “Low” wind speeds  “The chief financial officer of German utility RWE on Thursday acknowledged the importance of weather to its renewables segment, as the company reported ""much lower"" wind volumes in Northern and Central Europe for the first half of 2021”"
I need some of y'all sellers to do your thing so that I can buy some more at hysterical over reaction prices!!! Sell sell sell!!
Unless you day trade selectively the market is a vacuum cleaner taking your money!
………WTI and Crude…..Will be elevated tomorrow……Cheers
We see $ 70 next qtr based on strong cash flow generation and a growth powerhouse.
Nice oil pops green looking like they are painting the bottom of the trading range nicely.
………..Xom Currently 55.19…AH delight……
"I'm looking at the chemicals business... and the CCS business... I wonder if XOM should spin off and IPO those businesses (chemicals now, CSS when revenue positive). With the IPOed funds, XOM crushes debt, increases credit rating and has cash on hand to reinvest... just an idea."
Oil needs to close at these level to signal a true reversal in the recent bearish trend. If that happens XOM will begin to follow it up
FYI...XOM was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the whole Market on Friday.... What does that say? Chinese hedge funds?
Opec says no more oil . buy.
"If I had more cash, then I'd buy more XOM at these prices. It's profits are solid and increasing, and share price recovery will follow. Energy sector is trailing the rest of the market, but within 6 - 12 months should fair much better while many tech stock valuations eventually dip/correct and shareholders RUN to value stocks like XOM."
Googstapo continues on to its place as number one market cap company.
…….Don’t expect much until after the OPEC meeting tomorrow……
"Sold all my xom Shares above 60 USD, now bought back at 52,5 USD again, selling into unusual strength or holding? Buy back price was good, but to be honest i don't trust xom at all and just bought back because it was way oversold. Oil also bounced back nearly 10% in 2 days."
I loaded the boat today. More sharesCalls October 52.50 @ 3.90 avg October 57.50 @ 1.30 avg I will add some more when we have that gap down in the morning.
"end of day fade again? ....what ever the reason, there are a few nickels and dimes to be picked up with puts and shorting in the last hour most days"
They are selling 15 to 25 billion worth of Assets in the next 3 years! So plenty of liquidity you're paying down debt an increasing the dividend + only trading at 12 times forward earnings what the.......!

How many people here think brent/crude will be up but XOM down because of the hurricane putting stress on it's infrastructure?
No EOD fade.
Strong tailwinds for the Energy sector this week... bonus for XOM is the strong endorsement from BP and now I'm seeing articles regarding the Energy sector being a 'good bargin'
"What a difference a week makes. Or does it? Once the Delta spike levels off and rolls over the conversation will switch from “the sky is falling” to “the future looks bright”. Investors are fickle and always extrapolate current conditions into the future. Right now they can't look beyond Delta, they believe it will carry on well into the future when in reality it is going to peak and level off and that worry will subside. People will start to focus on fudamentals again. Oil prices don't need to be $80, at $60 to $70 oil companies are making good money and will continue to pay down debt, buy back stock and pay dividends. We are still well within that window. And more than likely once this Chicken Little fear induced sell off is over prices will stabilize and rise back into the $70's. If anything this will cause no new production to be pursued and it may even cause OPEC+ to pull back on increasing supply. The headwind of a rising dollar may persist, but longer term with our deficits we could see a structurally weaker dollar as Jeff Gundlach has pointed out ""the dollar is doomed""."
"8/28: Is the recent increase in XOM share price attributed to the pending hurricane making its way from Gulf of Mexico into Louisiana? This situation to me seems eerily similar to Hurricane Barry, which made landfall in Louisiana in July, 2019. The share price of XOM, Brent crude, and other oil companies rose until July 12 2019 (Friday). The following week, as the hurricane made it's way through USA, XOM share and Brent Crude price receded.On that basis I did sell portion of XOM on 8/27. Its a gamble I realize that, and I could be grossly wrong. Guess, then I will jump back in the XOM train."
Delta burning out quicker than expected. Up we go!
"- ExxonMobil -Some good, long hold news here. Motley Fool article, attached.Pay attention to ExxonMobil management style, especially item 3.Key Points...1. Global demand for oil is expected to continue rising in the coming decade.2. ExxonMobil's earnings over the past 10 years have been on a downward trend.3. The energy giant's debt level has risen significantly, but management is working to reduce it.1. The International Energy Agency estimates that the global demand for oil could rise to 104.1 million barrels per day in 2026 from an estimated 96.5 million barrels per day in 2021. It expects market demand to start plateauing from 2030 onwards. Road transport accounted for 60% of oil demand growth in the last decade. But a shift toward greater use of electric vehicles is looming.2. ExxonMobil stock has generated steady dividend income for millions of investors over the years, so it isn't surprising that it still has many fans, despite its lackluster share price performance. Over the last 10 years, ExxonMobil stock has generated a total return of 11.6%, compared to 372% for the S&P 500 Index. However, the stock largely outperformed the broader market in the 2000-2015 timeframe.3. The company has reduced its debt by $7 billion since the end of 2020. Its cost-cutting efforts have saved it $4 billion in structural expenses over the last 18 months. It is on track for total savings of $6 billion through 2023. Moreover, it reduced its annual capital expenditures from more than $24 billion in 2019 to $17 billion in 2020. Management now expects capital expenditures to be near the lower end of its 2021 guidance range of $16 billion to $19 billion. In short, it is moving in the right direction.Referencing item 3. In order to attract real ""Big Money"", the balance sheets need to read, ""Less Debt"". It looks better. Remember, perception is everything, especially in the corporate world.Right now this stock is (frenzied) being traded. Investors are needed for (smooth, steady, slow) growth.An example; look at a long time frame chart. BigChart 1985 through 2021, attached.Note high volume and fluctuation increases (frenzied) during bad times. Note low volume and fluctuation decreases (smooth, steady, slow) growth during good times. Volume tells its own story.Look at points in time, Market dump in 1987. 9/11 in 2001 through 2003, Subprime loans in 2008. Currently, Covid-19 virus in 2020.Hold!

oil is up all that matters we see $ 70 next qtr.
I have never seen such a disconnect between the oil price and the markets making new highs daily and the weakness across all areas of energy stocks. Very puzzling.
"If you are unhappy with this stock, sell it. If you no longer believe in future success, sell it. I personally feel there is far to much quick reaction to the latest talking points. We are not going to stop using oil any time in the near future (20+ years) and the demand in undeveloped countries will continue to rise. A 6% dividend comes with some risk, but certainly not the risk involved with speculative stocks. If you want a great appreciation in stock prices, put more into tech companies.....just don't expect a big dividend."
this consolidation is nessasary to move to $ 70 next qtr.
IWM put in a bottom. It almost touched the 200 dma. Hedge funds panicked and covered. Lol. We should be good here now.
So a common thread against the oil companies is that many countries are supporting the adoption of EV's. While this is true and will generate higher EV sales for oil companies it really doesn't matter. EV's don't use oil directly but the real metric that matters for oil companies are the rest of the vehicles in the vehicle fleet. What few realize is that since 2000 the quality of vehicles produced has dramatically improved and this should mean that vehicles can remain viable for many many years longer than we were used to 30 or 40 years ago. This means the actual fleet of oil powered vehicles is likely to still continue to grow as long as not all sales are EV's. So that fact that EV's will make up 50% or more of the vehicles sold by 2035 it likely will not mean that the actual number of gasoline powered vehicles on the road will be shrinking.
I just don't get it. Why is this slumping these days? Aramco reported 300 % profit increase. Oil industry is thriving!
Very flat… call options under performing the expected increases… i expect this to collapse to 55.49 by close…
Oil and Gas going ...
Jefferson
I thought the Fake Experts were saying a month ago that oil would bee $100.00 a bbl.? Funny stuff.
Talked to some analyst going to $ 70 soon see strong demand supply shock.
"30,000,000,000 + 44 gallons a barrel used every month.And oil stocks go down.Please xom. Psx. Cvx. Shut it down for a week and let's see."
"Fed taper tantrum this afternoon. We obviously take a hit with the rest of them, but when it's said and done it will shake the more rational investors out of the bloated portions of the market. When the euphoria dies fundamentals and value will matter again. Either way, some parts of this market have a long way to fall. Not much room to fall here."
Closed all longs. Markets are pushing overbought already. What a run since Friday. Too much too fast. Wish XOM would have performed better but my other longs made good. I will add to my index shorts for 2 more days Good luck longs.
"Very bullish close. Barring a crude or index futures meltdown tonight, we might see a really nice gap up again tomorrow. Exciting times."
monday could see a huge spike in oil prices depending on Cat 3 hurricane headed for Louisiana
Man they deleted that dudes post about the politi k s pretty quick.
Look at those sept 17 calls… big action at 60 and 65…
"Well, it's definitely a toss-up for the next week and moving toward 3Q. The optic is seemingly that there is 'blood in the streets' regarding the energy sector... that everything that can go wrong, is going wrong... but if you look at the fundamentals (I know, broken record), XOM is in a better position now than at the start of 2020. The demand/supply balance looks favorable for another 6Qs, they're reducing costs internally, they're hot on the Permian and Guyana, their Chem business is booming and refining margins are recovering/will recover with post COVID travel/movement. I'm not much of one for 'buying opportunities' exclusive of the fundamentals... but I'm not sure what the market can expect from XOM that makes it worth a forward PE of greater than ~12... If I'm XOM, I'm throwing out a share-buyback notice sometime prior to 3Q... they can buy shares 'cheap' too..."
Israel recorded highest number of COVID cases on Monday which is their highest since start of COVID and keep in mind 80% of their population is vaccinated.
Bank of America reiterates Exxon Mobil as buyBank of America reiterated its buy rating on the oil and gas company and said “defensive names look attractive.”
XOM to not open Baton Rouge refinery until Stanley power is secured again. Another impairment charge like the January freeze? How much income per day is that?
Interesting price action for crude when Katrina hit which was 16 years to the day. On last close of trading before Katrina hit 8/28 crude was 67.50. Did not see this high again until mid January of 2006. By 9/11 it was down to 63.00Bottoming @ 56 in mid November. Will be interesting to watch. With Powel at the helm I would imagine we see opposite trend this time.
Aren't you glad you didn't listen to the afternoon fade bumblers.
"CVX tanking, down to $93.Am I the only one who gets consolation that other oil majors are down too?"
"... Question... When the news talks about OPEC, does that also include Exxon? I know OPEC is made up of countries, but is Exxon a major oil producer within OPEC?"
Close $60 this week. Mark it.
"The street is asleep at the switch on XOM. $70 oil and $4 NG are steroids to XOM. Buy the lights out under $60. Further, the threat from EVs are a ruse especially with no electricity for weeks in LA and parts to CA."
This is most bipolar board ever. A drop or rise of 20 cents makes em jump. Lol
………..Shorts this week…….
"Must be “strong” dollar, fed stuff tanking oil stocks"
If Dems passed their $3.5 Trillion dream bill it would be extremely Bullish for oil as the Dollar would plummet i feel.
The people who complain all the time on here are just looking for instant results. It's going to take time to get rewarded for holding XOM. Maybe 6 months or longer.
"I still don't see why big oil is being blamed for climate change. Big oil does not put CO2 emissions in the air. Cars do. Airplanes do. Utility companies burn fuel to create electricity for our homes, our cities, even for our electric cars. Keep us cold in the summer and warm in the winter. Look at yourself in the mirror and say, I do. Not the oil companies."
Hundreds of thousands without power on the gulf. Weeks until grid running from solar and wind turbines again. Wonder how many Tesla charging stations are functional? What is working? Fossil fuel generators. So much for progress. Keep on drinking the koolaide.
it will be interesting to see how long it takes before the end of the day fade pattern returns
I'm hearing more negative chatter lately. That's when I know it's time to buy.
"This is a Covid driven sell-off. I also own HST, VTR, OHI, BA. They have been down the last 2 months as well. We all know this is going to pass and those that buy at these prices will do very well."
"Been long on hydrocarbons since covid crash. What a gift, generational contrarian opportunity, my only regret is not having more powder to capitalize on it. Long as so strong on hydrocarbons!"
Anybody with wisdom here aware of how much production of XOM is under threat from the Hurricane ?
"I'm torn. I like seeing my stock go up, but I'm planning on adding to it rather substantially in September. I think I'd prefer buying more of it cheap in a few weeks rather than enjoying the up days now. The price movement has been discouraging lately, but when you have plans of buying more it's also exciting. I see the energy sector doing better than the rest of the market in the next year or two."
I guess in the future when all the vehicles are electric they'll just have to shut Louisiana down for a few weeks while they recover the electrical grid from a cat 4 hurricane.

Look at the short squeeze in AMC. It’s hard to believe anyone would short that stock.
Who didn't see this coming? Surprised it didn't happen sooner. Delta is predicted to start waning in October. If you wait until then to get back in you will be late to the party.

………With a tropical storm heading to the Gulf of Mexico.This will disrupt the Supply…..Oil is heading higher and so is XOM…..next week shall be Good too…..Stay strong and Long…
You ask how much is energy oversold here? Let’s take a look. First we know the well known RSI hit 28-29 n the daily charts this week. But another indicator that is useful is the WilliamsR%. It hit 97. That indicator only goes to 100. It hit that on the daily as well as the weekly. It is lower on the weekly than when oil went sub 0.00. https://schrts.co/QbYnixtm
Sounds like capitulation happening on this board... good for us long term holders ...
Probably messed up selling my DVN. They are really piling in energy now
"Oil firms on Saturday cut nearly 91% of U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude oil production, roughly 1.65 million barrels, as Hurricane Ida makes its way toward major U.S. offshore oilfields.Roughly 84.87% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has also been shut in, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.Ida is forecast to reach a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall west of New Orleans.…..BULISH"

"XOM is making crazy money at these prices. Remember, Brent is what is important. This is a game. Many thought XOM would zip right back to 70's and bought in. The market makers know people are impatient and will grind many down until they sell. This WILL see 70's and 80+, but it could be next year, even late next year. Many will have folded their cards before then."
XOM should be bought because global supply is structurally diminished while demand stays relatively intact. NOT because a hurricane slammed the gulf.
Gerald Hollingsworth issues Strong Buy recommendation on ExxonMobil. That's a positive.
Why is crude down?Shouldn't there be a supply demand issue now?Why are oil companies up if crude is down?

"Can someone explain or link to ""Why did the US government request OPEC to produce more oil, instead of asking the domestic market?"" Back in 2018/2019 US production was higher than before. Therefore, its easier to reach a previous production rate than achieve a newer/ higher rate.Increased oil production has ripple effect not just to the oil company, but also the entire supply chain. It creates additional jobs - transporters, vendors, steel industry, engineering, etc. Oil industry creates high quality job, not the cyclical ""restaurant waiter"" or the ""gig worker"" delivering grocery to the door steps. All of which does reduce the jobless rate, but is not indicative of an overall healthy economy."
"So as of Aug. 2nd the CDC reports 164M vaccinated, about 5,300 symptomatic hospitalizations and slightly over 1,500 deaths for those who are vaccinated. Compare this to world-o-meters roughly 266,000 deaths in the US this year. That means 264,500 unvaccinated people died vs. 1,500 vaccinated. Now granted we ramped up vaccinations so you could double the 1,500 to take that into account, it is still a very very good ratio. Vaccines are effective at preventing death so clearly worth taking because as we see with Delta, 2nd or 3rd rounds of infections are very likely over the coming years.Note that if everyone had been vaccinated we would have lost only about 6,000 for the year, that means 260,000 deaths if the media hadn't allowed for the politics to rule the debate. So clearly they are the enemy of the people."
Thing that I find funny is that a lot of these divvy chasers don't realize the price drops the amount of the dividend the next day. If you don't even know that much you really are just gambling.
"Observation/question... what is FMV (use whatever metric you'd like) if 3Q FCF is $10B+, Earnings are $1.10+, debt retired is $5B+ and CAPEX in line with EOY target of ~$17B (meaning ~$6B)? Not a hypothetical, just use the metrics... which do we prefer? The roughly $20B in debt added in 2020 looks like it'll be retired by 2Q of 22... so that's in the cards and forecasts put Brent between $65-75 for all of '22... so 3Q (post hedging that hurt 2Q) will be a good example of what the next 5Q may look like... I think they'll run into an issue of what to do with the FCF... debt is cheap right now. How can they best deploy cash... maybe move further into the chemical and/or CCS space? I'd like to see a big project like Houston get 'approved' with a projected revenue stream... and they should dip their tow in geothermal (just to gain some ESG support)?"
"The problem here is that there are a lot of shorts trapped by the sudden recovery in oil. Until their Wall Street friends can make them whole, we're collared. Buy."
we can't start the afternoon fade slide this early!... It's noon! ... does everyone go home for the day to get back to The Hamptons to pick up their kids from school?
API net down 2.8M yeah oil prices ain't coming down anytime soon.
Looks like we got a streak going on fellas. This stock is dirt cheap and what a great dividend. Looks like Covid has peaked in the hardest hit areas and now that we have FDA approval of the vaccine it looks like greener pastures ahead.
Stay down! I want to reinvest under 55 come Sept. 10.
Oil is Up Up Up.....ExxonMobil stock is very undervalued.
The RSI will show an exhaustion signal today. We will most like close in the green. We will need to see volume. We saw some heavy volume in the last hour yesterday. I would say smart hedge funds started to cover yesterday in that hour. There has been a huge short position in energy since late June. Money flow has been positive in the last week. That divergence is what you need to see. They are loading longs back. These are big amounts of money and positions can not be taken or exited in just a day or two. This Kovid story has run its course now. Good luck longs. The bear trap is set. And I should know. I am a bear 90% of the time.
"ya'll who sold, just gave cheap shares to the con artists. They'll be profitable off it by Thanksgiving, while you are still counting your losses. Such an easy game for them."
Just sitting back watching all the short players...Its amusing watching all the EV lovers showing up on this board when there is any type of pullback. Which is all this is if your a long. Also with US policy as it stands Repubs will be in control again really soon and oil will thrive
Still way undervalued. Fair value $70.
"If the Delta was that big a concern, M would not be blowing past 52 week highs. Drop in oil is staged. Buy the dip."
Try an experiment: put everyone who's name begins with a J on mute.
Oversold. May take a few more months but this is going to explode upwards at some point.
.........Xom up .22 one little Step for Exxon one large step for Exxon shareholders...
XOM $90 price target with BUY rating at Bank of America
"Depending on XOM Baton Rouge's refinery... we will likely see 1.5-2.3Mbpd shuttered for a 2-3day stretch... really interesting timing with the end of summer approaching. Some impact to oil as well, but less of a 'percentage impact'... coincidentally, OPEC+ meeting, China no more Delta, and US COVID turning the corner... I'd speculate that the energy sector may be able to get up off the floor here really soon... especially with NG going vertical (not just US, look at Europe and especially Asia for the winter). GS may prove smarter than us all if oil hits $80 by the end of September."

I really don’t know how they are holding this market up
How come not one analyst warned about this kind of a pullback/ correction in oil stocks!
I love all the plants that show up and try to reassure people as the shares melt down yet again…
"China just bought 20,000 paintings from Hunter Bai Dung. What will happen next week?"
We could see a 3% rise tomorrow and would be under $56 lol....the fix is in
Countries complaining about oil $65-$75 ....OPEC needs to make thembeg for $75 oil and cut production to drive price to $100 lol
Hedge funds' bets against us due to the Delta burning out as quick as they came. Buy the lights out below $60. Thank me later.
"Investing in stocks with your personal wealth is a big boys game. Stocks ebb and flow with news and speculation. Wall Street thrives on volatility. Buffet always says ""I wouldn't spend 10 minutes investing in a stock that I wouldn't hold for 10 years. XOM is a perfect example. Relax take the 6% return dollar cost average and be patient. Your patience will be rewarded. The political narrative is be afraid of the latest variant. Mathematics suggest that in time most will be vaccinated and will also have natural immunity.This too shall pass and XOM will be in the 70's again."
".01 cent dollar up in month.and oil and companies are collapsing.Really$45,000 for one bitcoin.no oil and gas for machines to dig bitcoin no bitcoin.Something is really wrong with wallstreet."
Buying it up in after hours. Maybe tomorrow will add another 2-3%
WTIC took out the 100dma at 67.70. Next stop is 70.75. Can’t stop the oil train. I imagine we see Goldman’s 80 pretty quick.
"- XOM -All one needed to do was, buy XOM stock around $52 and change on, Thursday 8/19/21. Hold stock for six days. Sell same XOM stock at $56 and change at, the open of trading day, today, Monday morning 8/30/21. Approximately, 8.5% gain for a six day hold. There was a time, when owning a mutual fund that gave a 8% yield annually, for three to five years running, was a good open-end investment pick. Why bother when you can get a same capital gain in six days.Somebody should write a sitcom, a book, or a song called. ""Buy, Sell, Hold"". High Drama and Humorous all at the same time. Sitcom could have characters like those from ""Seinfeld"" and ""Big Bang Theory"". Book could be written similar to ""The Big Short"". Song could be composed like the ballad ""The Gambler"" by Kenny Rodgers, lyrics such as ""Every gambler knows, that the secret to survivin', is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep"".It's not the old adage ""Buy on bad news, sell on good news"". It's more like kick them when they're down. Sooner or later this will change. Increased profits, less debt, and the need for good products will catch up. ExxonMobile has revenues of ~$265M that employs ~75,000 people. As of (June 2020) Wikipedia has ExxonMobile listed as the fifth largest company by revenue in the United States, ahead of, United Health Care and Berkshire Hathaway.Cut and paste; List of largest companies in the United States by revenueHold!

"Broken record, but UK weeks past their peak, still elevated cases but daily deaths are 0 to 150, compared to last wave where deaths peaked in the 1,600-1,800. Too bad most people don't seem to be thinking rationally and have let the delta hysteria become a self-fulfilling economic reality"
So 50 is the new resistance. But this gap up is quite nice. Smart money covered last week. It was all opex related

Big boy shorts opened in the last month now at risk. Joe's dumping of 20 million barrels onto the market does not change the fundamental picture of increased demand from reopening.

"do the math vaccines help against servere delta variant cases. Because of that, no lockdowns and no business impact. oil is 64 $ and we will see $:70 xom next week. dont be scared. green oil is the future."
way oversold
