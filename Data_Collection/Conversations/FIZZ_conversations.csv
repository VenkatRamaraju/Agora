"looks like a Biden win.... more taxes means, a big div is coming very soon and I still think a share split. Shorts are going to feel quite a bit of pain..... I have shorted this stock in the past and made a lot of money. Now is the time to be long and take positions with options."
"I like the slow steady moves this had been doing before yesterday. Hopefully this calms down a bit and continues on its upward trajectory. I think this may have been a blip on the radar of a nice long term increase. Overall, the price of around $140 -$150 is still a good entry price and is more in line with the trend of the 12 month chart."
"It has been my experience with this stock that when you see movement without any real news in advance of a PR( upcoming qtr) that someone is whispering good news. It is clear that revenues and profits will continue to be stellar given the COVID dynamic. It is also clear that they will now have $350 million dollars in cash or over $8.00 a share. Historically this has been paid as a dividend which benefits the shareholders of which the CEO is 75%. In addition the BOD agreed to an incremental 250m shares of common stock(5x) current share count. So I see really great earnings, a 5 for 1 split. These two events should move the stock to 85. At the same time as the split a $1-$1.50 per share post split dividend pushing the stock up again to 100. there will be a 5 day window for this all to happen because the CEO will want to crush the shorts. My guess is that they are already starting to cover because the writing is on the way."
"I'm looking for the reason short sellers would love this stock, can someone tell me? I'm seeing earnings growth and consistent beats, positive growing cash flow, and a current/quick ratio of 4:1. Where is the catch?"
"I sold my entire FIZZ position in 2016 after quadrupling my money. I recently built a new position below $42. It may take a while to recover, but the upside potential now far exceeds the downside risks."
According to this Forbes article from earlier this year the CEO owns 74% of this stock. My take on this fact and the fact that they normally pay a pretty high dividend is that stock price appreciation is not the primary goal of either the CEO or the institutional investors. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2019/03/08/national-beverage-stocks-lack-of-fizz-is-yet-another-indication-that-corporate-governance-matters/#9f280e87f7ce
"As a separate note, Tis the season and based on the fact that Fizzle has at least $200mil in the bank( close to $5.00 share) and is still making good money, I would say it is time for the owners to pay themselves and the outstanding shareholders some of the cash. History says the announcement will come out soon and be payable in Jan. So I can see Ole Nick paying himself and little Joe at least $4.00 a share or close to a 10% dividend. Time to cover and buy some shares to collect the Dividend. Merry Holidays."
"We still have 2 million shares to go. We have some naked shorts here, so the margin calls will be starting soon. Forced selling hold your shares and buy more. The pressure will be incredible."
Jeremy made this trending
Will the shorts need to pay the stock dividend to the shareholders they borrowed from like a cash dividend.

"Fizzy should be steady as she goes thru the rest of the year. Lot's of cash on the balance sheet and it would seem to me that we can expect a Christmas dividend of at leasts $3.00 a share. Possible incremental positives: Sale of La Croix to Coke, innovation( not likely from this management team). Possible downsides.... Market correction, FIZZ would follow( buy the dip) something happens to the CEO is in the mid 80's.... No crazy PR's lately so perhaps he is keeping it together and keeping his hands to himself...."
"Earnings are out , they are excellent, set new all time records, also released statement of the 3 new flavors, it’s the best introduction ever any previous intro’s, they said to expect great sales from them, FIZZ can easily go up 20 points or more with the float that’s available and the amount of Short Shares of interest now at 47.51 % of the float."
bank of America and royal bank increasing their positions oin fizz... why is the stock falling so much today?
"Ho hum, I'm just here by myself making bank. Not even a short squeeze yet, with only 650k shares traded and 7.3M shares short. See you all on the moon. :P"
"Great company, but at 31 times earnings, I'm taking my money off the table. No idea why it popped 11% this morning, but I'll take my gain and run. See you again when the stock is back trading at a more appropriate multiple."
"Fizzy fans..... They are selling La Criox to Coke. 70 dollars a share cash deal for share holders. The short squeeze is only 10% done, 6 million more shares.... 170."
"I’ve had this company long term since I think 13 dollars. It’s a nice company and they send you samples of new drinks with their annual report. Which is a nice touch. I’d have likes to see more people stay long term, would have been nice, but I get the game."
The shorts are daring the CEO to increase the dividend on 12/2. Fizz can afford a $7.00 dividend and could push it up to $10 with a little creative financing. That would be a 10% dividend which they have done in the past and that would really be a challenging situation for the 7 million shares short.
"Based on my share count, still have about 3m more shares to cover.... Message to the CEO, when you do a PR on Friday about paying the $6.0 dividend and we know you can repeat this in the next few months if you want to, how about announcing a 5 for 1 stock split to get the share price back down to $40.00 with 300 million outstanding shares..... That should get us to 250-300 by Friday. I think you will have done quite enough damage and it will be a while until anyone shorts your stock again with all the positive trends you have going on. Shorts playing some games in the AH but it won't hold up...."
"Bought 500 shares yesterday, earnings after the bell today? I do feel after doing my DD that FIZZ is a big sleeper ready for a big jump if earnings come in strong as I expect, according to TD AMER the short interest is 47.51%, unless I’m missing something , with only 96 mill shares on the float and such a high short interest FIZZ could rocket."
"LaCroix Sparkling Water is suddenly everywhere. In the last several years it has become somewhat of a status symbol for foodies, fashion icons, and fitness gurus.It has attracted a cult following as a result, and sales have exploded."
"Below is another one of my posts from two years ago when FIZZ was trading for over $100 a share. Perhaps StockMonkey learn from it and articulate why he decided to short FIZZ today (9/10/19) at $44.16.@Mike - I have a background in equity research and have been investing for over 20 years. I could write a book on the beverage industry, but I find that most people on these boards have little financial knowledge, so I try to keep it simple. That said, below is more detail about why a water company should not trade for 45 times earnings.In fact, very few companies warrant a PE of 45, and no company in history has ever warranted it for very long. One company that warrants a very high PE is Alphabet. Over 96% of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising. Every time you do a Google search and click on an ad, Alphabet collects revenue. What does it cost Alphabet to generate that revenue? It doesn't have to manufacturer or package anything. It doesn't have to distribute anything, which means it doesn't need a fleet of trucks and drivers and gas and warehouses to store inventory. It doesn't have to worry about damaged inventory and inventory management issues. None of these costly and expensive issues apply to a company like Alphabet. That means Alphabet faces far fewer risks, and it's margins are far higher, which justifies a high valuation.There is also the very important issue of competition. Google dominants the search market, and there is no incentive for anyone to switch away from using Google. This creates an enormous competitive advantage, which keeps Alphabet's margins high, which justifies a high valuation.Now contrast this with a water company. Unless a company has a special formula and enormous brand equity, such as Coke, any competitor can easily step in and steal market share. This leads to lower pricing power and lower margins, which justifies a lower valuation. LaCroix is a great product, but I am already seeing store brands copying LaCroix's flavors and packaging. In fact, just the other day I saw a display of sparkling water near the door at Whole Foods. It looked just like LaCroix, same flavors and colorful eight can packaging, yet when I looked closer, I realized that it wasn't LaCroix. It was an off name brand selling for a lot less than LaCroix. I noticed the same thing at CVS. This may explain why FIZZ's profit margin barely increased last quarter. Competition is the death sentence of margins, profits and high PEs.Please note that Alphabet with all of its advantages over FIZZ, trades for just 33 times earnings compared to FIZZ's PE of 44.You mention LULU as a reason to stick with a high PE stock. I sold FIZZ last year at $55 a share after more than quadrupling my investment. Based on your logic, I should be upset for missing out on the run from $55 to over $100, but I never second guessed my decision to sell FIZZ at $55. Wise investing is about taking calculated risks, and even at $55, the downside risk far outweighed any upside potential.Of course, there are examples of stocks with high PE's that have done well. However, numerous studies have proven that low PE stocks consistently outperform high PE stocks. In fact, if you study the S&P 500 on a rolling basis, you will find that when PEs were high, returns over the following 10 years were below average, and when PEs were low, returns over the following 10 years were above average. This is commonsense, but many investors get caught up in the hype of the moment and convince themselves that this time is different.It is important to distinguish between investing and speculating. When I bought FIZZ for 13 times earnings, the downside risk was far outweighed by the upside potential. That is what defines investing. If you decide to hold FIZZ today despite its high PE, you are merely gambling that there will be a greater fool who will pay more in the future than you paid today. That is what defines speculating. Speculating is based on hope, not tangible measures of business fundamentals.I hope I was able to give you a little more color on why a water company does not warrant a PE of 45. Unfortunately, I have already spend too much time on this post. However, I will check back in a year to see how your investment in FIZZ turns out. Let's make a friendly bet. I bet you that in 12 months, FIZZ is trading for a far lower market value than it trades today. If you understand PE the way you say you do, you know that the odds are overwhelmingly in my favor. See you in 12 months. Good luck!"
"Stock split. The 50% drop was quite something to see, though!"
"National Beverage (FIZZ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18.18%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this soft drink and seltzer maker would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of 8.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times."
"New data out. Still over 4Million shares short as of 1/29. So it went up to $196 from 3Million shorts covering, let's see what it does when the other 4Million+ cover :D"
Still not sure how this justifies a 15% drop...https://seekingalpha.com/news/3510896-national-beverage-double-digits-poor-nielsen-numbers
I think'est we may be on the road to $ 60.00 before too long.
Should be all up from here ..... long hot summer with lots of beverage consumption. Next quarter reporting should be higher.
"Less than 2M shares traded today. Even if every trade was a short covering (which of course it's not), there are still over 5M shares short. It's more likely that some of them doubled down today, and this is just getting started. I love the 1 year chart, the cash position of the company, and the company's plans. The short interest is simply a bit of icing on the cake. This one will go back past today's high soon, I bet."
"Here is a question for all you investors out there. What are the largest retailers in the North American Market: Answer: Wal Mart, Costco and Kroger. Which one does a disported amount of the la croix volume: Costco. Costco is a limited product offering retailer that does in some cases up to 20% of a companies business. Is there anything a company can do if a retailer like this decides to not carry your products? Answer- no. Why would costco not carry the number one brand in sparkling water: Answer, Kirkland Signature is a equal product and a better value to customers who pay a membership fee. What effect will this have on Fizzle, : Lower sales, lower profits, higher expenses on every product they make because they have employees and plants.... Any Costco is viewed as a leadership account. It will signal that it is ok to not carry La Croix. Who will follow, Target, Wal Mart, Whole Foods, Publix, Kroger..... What will happen. Many bad things the least the stock price will fall."
Game shop has already almost recovered the entire AH panic. FIZZ will follow suit. We will end up higher for the rest of the week.... It is about the math... no way out.
"Please share this message.Hello everyone,We all know the current hype on the stock market with a high rate of short selling. I'm not saying that GME and AMC are bad stocks at the moment, but there is one stock with a short float of 80% and above that looks really good fundamentally. This stock is $MAC. It's particularly distinctive and I'll save you the financial details here, but basically the market valuation is very low compared to its intrinsic value.You will thank me later. If you want to understand why fundamentally the company is worth it, please take a look at the community and you'll understand in about 5 min. https://www.reddit.com/r/MACArmyBets/"
"What is the bull case for Fizzy for 2021? Here is what we know. The main business they have that matters is the sparkling water business. The long term trend on that category is expected to grow 15-20% per year for the next 5 years. La Criox is the number one brand and is holding the position. With Covid, La Criox wins because it is only a retail business and there is a supply chain constraint for the next year that will strengthen that position. So it is a safe bet to assume 10% revenue growth and 20% profit growth. It is also possible but unlikely that someone like Coke or KDP would buy the brand for about 3b or about $70 a share and Fizz would still owe the plants and the other brands. There is also the possibility that they would come up with something incremental on the line extension side, but not likely. So after the upcoming dividend of $275 million dollars fizz with have $125 left over and will make $200m next year. So there is another $5-7 dollar div for next year. Also, with KO, PEP, KDP the average PE is 30. That would translate to 110 sp for fizz being the same as them. Monster is at 41 but there margins are much higher. I see only macro issues driving the stock price down. Fizz should be in your portfolio for next year. Every month the shorts hang on it costs them interest. At some point they will move on."
"Purchased around $55 with the mind that it was too good of a deal to let pass by. Saw it crash to $40 (-27% unrealized loss) but surprisingly I was very calm about it and not worried. All the bashing from the news and the lawsuits that was unable to prove anything truly negative about the company or their products only caused a hit to their earnings. When the bashing slowed and stopped, earning reports were getting increasingly better again which proves to me that they have a very strong and loyal consumer base and pulling along new customers along the way. I'll keep my investments because I do believe that if all goes well with the overall market that FIZZ will return to record high levels again."
"You have to understand that FIZZ is a tiny $4 billion dollar company that is 75% owned by one man. In fact, only about $800 million in market cap is available to trade. So there should be no surprise as to why the stock price is volatile. But if you can handle the volatility, there is plenty of upside in the stock over the long-term."
"I can't believe there's STILL no conversation about this one. 7.3M shares short out of 8.8M float. This hasn't even started squeezing yet. Compared to the other WSB ones, this one hasn't even been touched and has more potential than all but GME, I think. I thought the price was too high (even though it shouldn't matter), but now they're buying GME at $300, so it can't be that."
"Sell the news? Did anybody notice that they are going to issue 201m more common shares? 5 for 1 split? 305m dollars in cash? on 250 million shares that is around $1.00 dividend post split. More float, plus short squeeze and solid results says this is going much higher at this point."
"looks like the madness will continue next week. Fizz is a strong company regardless but once all the revolutionists turn from Game and the others this will really go up much much more. The reason is because the CEO holds 76% of the float so the available shares are much less. There are still millions of shares short that need to cover and I believe the CEO will split the stock soon as the BOD already approved enough shares for a 5 for 1 split. It is a good long term investment as the business trends are positive and they print money, but the current environment has the potential to shoot this beyond what is reasonable. It is already up $9.00 in AH for Monday. That sort of movement has propelled the daily move close to $50 swings in a day. Drop in a little positive news and there is no upside. Looking forward to next week."
Is this a Public or Private company.????Most companies release information on the top managers. Like education and experience.Why not FIZZ? If anyone knows anything please reply. I think this is a family business that pretends to be a public company.Seems like the same last name of top company people.Can not find out anything about their education or what colleges they went to.
