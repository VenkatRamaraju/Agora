"looks like the madness will continue next week. Fizz is a strong company regardless but once all the revolutionists turn from Game and the others this will really go up much much more. The reason is because the CEO holds 76% of the float so the available shares are much less. There are still millions of shares short that need to cover and I believe the CEO will split the stock soon as the BOD already approved enough shares for a 5 for 1 split. It is a good long term investment as the business trends are positive and they print money, but the current environment has the potential to shoot this beyond what is reasonable. It is already up $9.00 in AH for Monday. That sort of movement has propelled the daily move close to $50 swings in a day. Drop in a little positive news and there is no upside. Looking forward to next week."
"Look my post before 21 days, I said if you buy fizz better after it drop to below $45I think my prediction is right."
Should be all up from here ..... long hot summer with lots of beverage consumption. Next quarter reporting should be higher.
$FIZZ that makes La Croix soda drinks is heavily shorted (>40%) in spite of it's excellent fundamentals and consistent earnings beats. It is a pure manipulation scheme and would truly benefit from your support. Give it a look if you are truly in it to save the oppressed companies. Robinhood it up and trim the Hedges!
The last special dividend was announced on 11/29. History will most likely repeat itself. Ole St Nickola is coming a bit early this year.... Merry holidays........
Jeremy loves fizz
"National Beverage (FIZZ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18.18%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this soft drink and seltzer maker would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of 8.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times."
"Just some insight from a customer and investor on the theory that LaCroix will be pushed out of the market by a cheap replacement.I will not stop buying Starbuck's coffee, Coke-Classic or La Croix because there is a cheap substitute available. Some people will switch over but I think that is a minority of La Croix customer base. My wife and I have tried all of the other sparkling waters and Perrier is the only one that is close on flavor; Perrier charges a premium as well. We have actually stopped trying the look-a-like discount brands due to consistent disappointment."
FIZZ is a very good position right now. No debt and lots of cash. Now how to use it wisely? Hire top MBA's and let them run the company. The family can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor.
"I wonder how much grizzly has lost short selling this stock. Perhaps Grizzly doesn’t know but Brian Roberts, the ceo of Comcast, is also the founder’s son and that company has performed wellWhat does no new board members have to do with anything?This report seemed like a lot of unsubstantiated allegations to mehttps://grizzlyreports.com/we-still-call-a-spade-a-spade-why-we-believe-national-beverage-corp-fizz-might-be-a-better-short-than-ever/"
The shorts are daring the CEO to increase the dividend on 12/2. Fizz can afford a $7.00 dividend and could push it up to $10 with a little creative financing. That would be a 10% dividend which they have done in the past and that would really be a challenging situation for the 7 million shares short.
Jeremy made this trending
"I like the slow steady moves this had been doing before yesterday. Hopefully this calms down a bit and continues on its upward trajectory. I think this may have been a blip on the radar of a nice long term increase. Overall, the price of around $140 -$150 is still a good entry price and is more in line with the trend of the 12 month chart."
holding and adding for the div.
"Great growth stock to own....they got beaten down by some negative publicity, but the LaCroix brand is solid and makes a ton of cash for the company. Say all you want about Coke, Pepsi and others having better distribution or deeper pockets. LaCroix has the better name brand & better taste by far, and it's the original that people still flock to."
Etrade shows 71.00 +7.6200 (+12.02%). Should be good day tomorrow.

Opened a long position today. This is a good price for a quick trade.
Time to announce the dividend to squeeze the #$%$ shorts $100 here it comes!
If I sell before the payout date but after the ex-dividend do I still receive the dividend?
"Not quite done yet, another 3 million shares.... Watch for the 5 for 1 split coming this week. Already preapprove. This will go over 200 today. Market will come back a bit and this will pop even more."
Like if ur long dislike of short
any news
Apparently the company doesnt do cc’s. They just post the report on their site.
La croix was sold out during the pandemic
"$FIZZ has been showing support at 43.39 and resistance at 46.85. Bullish indication in MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
wait to $35 .
So the earnings are out. Phase one done. Phase two coming. Split...... Phase 3 spread the wealth of the 350m in cash.
Was a La Croixer way before it got trendy. All that did was raise the price. I buy generic now? 2.50 max for a case. Skip the $5 La Croix.
"Dorothy - The most important piece of INFO is that a water company should not be trading at 45 times earnings. FIZZ has a tiny float, so it doesn't take much enthusiasm to drive the stock price to unsustainable levels. But it cuts both ways. It is just a matter of time before the stock gets cut in half. Most high growth tech companies cannot justify a PE of 45. Paying 45 times earnings for a water company is irrational."
"They got their 15% drop and more, can't believe people are falling for this sell BS.La Croix, is the best thing out there selling off the shelves everywhere at this point.This is a easy ride back to $50!"
"When is the next earnings report, please?"
Cover shorts now. This is about to go GME.
"Based on my share count, still have about 3m more shares to cover.... Message to the CEO, when you do a PR on Friday about paying the $6.0 dividend and we know you can repeat this in the next few months if you want to, how about announcing a 5 for 1 stock split to get the share price back down to $40.00 with 300 million outstanding shares..... That should get us to 250-300 by Friday. I think you will have done quite enough damage and it will be a while until anyone shorts your stock again with all the positive trends you have going on. Shorts playing some games in the AH but it won't hold up...."
"Sell the news? Did anybody notice that they are going to issue 201m more common shares? 5 for 1 split? 305m dollars in cash? on 250 million shares that is around $1.00 dividend post split. More float, plus short squeeze and solid results says this is going much higher at this point."
"What is the bull case for Fizzy for 2021? Here is what we know. The main business they have that matters is the sparkling water business. The long term trend on that category is expected to grow 15-20% per year for the next 5 years. La Criox is the number one brand and is holding the position. With Covid, La Criox wins because it is only a retail business and there is a supply chain constraint for the next year that will strengthen that position. So it is a safe bet to assume 10% revenue growth and 20% profit growth. It is also possible but unlikely that someone like Coke or KDP would buy the brand for about 3b or about $70 a share and Fizz would still owe the plants and the other brands. There is also the possibility that they would come up with something incremental on the line extension side, but not likely. So after the upcoming dividend of $275 million dollars fizz with have $125 left over and will make $200m next year. So there is another $5-7 dollar div for next year. Also, with KO, PEP, KDP the average PE is 30. That would translate to 110 sp for fizz being the same as them. Monster is at 41 but there margins are much higher. I see only macro issues driving the stock price down. Fizz should be in your portfolio for next year. Every month the shorts hang on it costs them interest. At some point they will move on."
Fizzy get dizzy
Margins have peaked. Time to short.
"Bought 500 shares yesterday, earnings after the bell today? I do feel after doing my DD that FIZZ is a big sleeper ready for a big jump if earnings come in strong as I expect, according to TD AMER the short interest is 47.51%, unless I’m missing something , with only 96 mill shares on the float and such a high short interest FIZZ could rocket."
"I sold my entire FIZZ position in 2016 after quadrupling my money. I recently built a new position below $42. It may take a while to recover, but the upside potential now far exceeds the downside risks."
weren't earnings suppose to be today???
So whats going on here? I don't see any news.
Everyday 30 cents high Fizz share like that?
FIZZ is down -5.46% to 97.48
Fizzy Get Dizzy
According to this Forbes article from earlier this year the CEO owns 74% of this stock. My take on this fact and the fact that they normally pay a pretty high dividend is that stock price appreciation is not the primary goal of either the CEO or the institutional investors. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2019/03/08/national-beverage-stocks-lack-of-fizz-is-yet-another-indication-that-corporate-governance-matters/#9f280e87f7ce
"LaCroix Sparkling Water is suddenly everywhere. In the last several years it has become somewhat of a status symbol for foodies, fashion icons, and fitness gurus.It has attracted a cult following as a result, and sales have exploded."
"Don,t buy fizz for time being ($68.10). it will drop another $10 at least , may be around $50 ."
They say you buy management - their quarterly releases are weird documents.
"Below is another one of my posts from two years ago when FIZZ was trading for over $100 a share. Perhaps StockMonkey learn from it and articulate why he decided to short FIZZ today (9/10/19) at $44.16.@Mike - I have a background in equity research and have been investing for over 20 years. I could write a book on the beverage industry, but I find that most people on these boards have little financial knowledge, so I try to keep it simple. That said, below is more detail about why a water company should not trade for 45 times earnings.In fact, very few companies warrant a PE of 45, and no company in history has ever warranted it for very long. One company that warrants a very high PE is Alphabet. Over 96% of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising. Every time you do a Google search and click on an ad, Alphabet collects revenue. What does it cost Alphabet to generate that revenue? It doesn't have to manufacturer or package anything. It doesn't have to distribute anything, which means it doesn't need a fleet of trucks and drivers and gas and warehouses to store inventory. It doesn't have to worry about damaged inventory and inventory management issues. None of these costly and expensive issues apply to a company like Alphabet. That means Alphabet faces far fewer risks, and it's margins are far higher, which justifies a high valuation.There is also the very important issue of competition. Google dominants the search market, and there is no incentive for anyone to switch away from using Google. This creates an enormous competitive advantage, which keeps Alphabet's margins high, which justifies a high valuation.Now contrast this with a water company. Unless a company has a special formula and enormous brand equity, such as Coke, any competitor can easily step in and steal market share. This leads to lower pricing power and lower margins, which justifies a lower valuation. LaCroix is a great product, but I am already seeing store brands copying LaCroix's flavors and packaging. In fact, just the other day I saw a display of sparkling water near the door at Whole Foods. It looked just like LaCroix, same flavors and colorful eight can packaging, yet when I looked closer, I realized that it wasn't LaCroix. It was an off name brand selling for a lot less than LaCroix. I noticed the same thing at CVS. This may explain why FIZZ's profit margin barely increased last quarter. Competition is the death sentence of margins, profits and high PEs.Please note that Alphabet with all of its advantages over FIZZ, trades for just 33 times earnings compared to FIZZ's PE of 44.You mention LULU as a reason to stick with a high PE stock. I sold FIZZ last year at $55 a share after more than quadrupling my investment. Based on your logic, I should be upset for missing out on the run from $55 to over $100, but I never second guessed my decision to sell FIZZ at $55. Wise investing is about taking calculated risks, and even at $55, the downside risk far outweighed any upside potential.Of course, there are examples of stocks with high PE's that have done well. However, numerous studies have proven that low PE stocks consistently outperform high PE stocks. In fact, if you study the S&P 500 on a rolling basis, you will find that when PEs were high, returns over the following 10 years were below average, and when PEs were low, returns over the following 10 years were above average. This is commonsense, but many investors get caught up in the hype of the moment and convince themselves that this time is different.It is important to distinguish between investing and speculating. When I bought FIZZ for 13 times earnings, the downside risk was far outweighed by the upside potential. That is what defines investing. If you decide to hold FIZZ today despite its high PE, you are merely gambling that there will be a greater fool who will pay more in the future than you paid today. That is what defines speculating. Speculating is based on hope, not tangible measures of business fundamentals.I hope I was able to give you a little more color on why a water company does not warrant a PE of 45. Unfortunately, I have already spend too much time on this post. However, I will check back in a year to see how your investment in FIZZ turns out. Let's make a friendly bet. I bet you that in 12 months, FIZZ is trading for a far lower market value than it trades today. If you understand PE the way you say you do, you know that the odds are overwhelmingly in my favor. See you in 12 months. Good luck!"
This things gonna blow trough expectations
"This stock is likely a short as I don't see the distribution moat that PEP has with it's Bubly brand. At my work it used to be Lacroix until a year back when Bubly just took over. Just an anecdotal evidence, I am sure the same is happening across other retail stores."
RC COLA IS INTERESTED IN FIZZ
"For what it is worth, I am a huge Apple fan for the long term.... Read the earnings transcript. Quite amazing. Buying the dip on that one. The other stock I really love is OMER... Biotech getting ready to really explode. 20 to 100( short squeeze) then to 600 based on current commercial revenues, upcoming FDA approval of new drug( 3B market cap on it's own within the next few months) and most exciting is the COVID therapy to help save millions of lives for really ill people. Gets them out of the ICU very quickly. Quite amazing."
"Enjoying the ride down. Going to cover a little today. Why get greedy. Wondering how much a stock should be valued at when one person owns 75%? Sales and profits going down, competition really getting tough. Same old Fizzle story.... Nobody really cares anymore.... It will keep going down. Should be valued at about 1 times sales because of the high individual ownership. That would put it at about 1/2 of what it is now."

"I can't believe there's STILL no conversation about this one. 7.3M shares short out of 8.8M float. This hasn't even started squeezing yet. Compared to the other WSB ones, this one hasn't even been touched and has more potential than all but GME, I think. I thought the price was too high (even though it shouldn't matter), but now they're buying GME at $300, so it can't be that."
"Don't know how any beverage companies will be able to overlap Feb, March, April revenues from 2020 based on the panic buying and loading during that time. Fizz will have fine results but will show negative growth. Stock will most likely go down. They won't report this until July. Dead money until then. Better investments and then short when the last quarter release is announced."
"Great company, but at 31 times earnings, I'm taking my money off the table. No idea why it popped 11% this morning, but I'll take my gain and run. See you again when the stock is back trading at a more appropriate multiple."
when qtr ?
"I'm looking for the reason short sellers would love this stock, can someone tell me? I'm seeing earnings growth and consistent beats, positive growing cash flow, and a current/quick ratio of 4:1. Where is the catch?"
"Don,t buy FIZZ for time being ($59.98). It will drop more than $15 at least, should below $44.the reason, every one knew already."
"Year-over-year sales growth over the past four quarters were: 17%, 15%, 13%, 7%. Yes, sales are rapidly decelerating."
Coke isn’t going to let Pepsi (Bubbly) and Nestle (Perrier) own this category. Coke will have to launch a brand from scratch to compete or buy FIZZ and enter the category as the market leader overnight.

who here is buying from hearing about this stock from Jeremy on financial education on youtube?
"Ho hum, I'm just here by myself making bank. Not even a short squeeze yet, with only 650k shares traded and 7.3M shares short. See you all on the moon. :P"
Shelf space is increasing. Costco has about 25 ft of shelf space. Local grocery stores are increasing their shelf space. Only observed in my western neck of the country. I believe the next earning call will turn this stock up. They are over the cockroach injustice and poised for exceptional earning..

Fizzy get dizzy...?
"Here we go again....another egg head claiming La Croix has unhealthy ingredients. Been there, done that, and La Croix still keeps selling"
$32 is on the way.
Nearly 100% earnings growth.
Watched this beat earnings last time and tanked. Got out this time before it tanked too much. I will watch and buy in but if it is like last time it's dead money until earnings again.
Everyday that goes by we are getting closer to the drop dead date to pull the trigger on the Special Dividend. it has to be in the next 21-30 days. The movement is indicative of covering or people in the know. Next week should be over 100.
"Here is a question for all you investors out there. What are the largest retailers in the North American Market: Answer: Wal Mart, Costco and Kroger. Which one does a disported amount of the la croix volume: Costco. Costco is a limited product offering retailer that does in some cases up to 20% of a companies business. Is there anything a company can do if a retailer like this decides to not carry your products? Answer- no. Why would costco not carry the number one brand in sparkling water: Answer, Kirkland Signature is a equal product and a better value to customers who pay a membership fee. What effect will this have on Fizzle, : Lower sales, lower profits, higher expenses on every product they make because they have employees and plants.... Any Costco is viewed as a leadership account. It will signal that it is ok to not carry La Croix. Who will follow, Target, Wal Mart, Whole Foods, Publix, Kroger..... What will happen. Many bad things the least the stock price will fall."
"Wondering why FIZZ is dropping when the dow is up 300 points??? Fairly simply to figure out. First the competitive pressure in the industry with other lower costed brands and store brands are causing FIZZ to lower the wholesale costs or increase the promotional action to maintain the sales trends. That is a losing battle for them. Then you have higher input costs on Aluminum because of all the tariffs and Nationalist polices our wonderful President is implementing. So they have to reduce there margins based on competition, then the costs go up. Further impacting the profitable aspect of the line of products. Add in a shortage of soda cans and you have the perfect formula for continued growth. Overlay SEC, Civil and Ethical concerns, this stock is going down."
"If you buy REED for $20 per share cash, people might think that St. Croix doesn't have a fishy after-taste ?"
"Forming a nice base at 145. Still a lot of short shares and the vast majority of the shares are held by the CEO which won't be selling. So they are stuck with some really big losses. They scared a few long holders out first thing but expect this to be very volatile to the upside with any kind of positive news which there are at least 3 opportunities. The stock cannot settle out until the shorts are not longer in it and they are trapped..... The short bet did not work out. I would not be surprised if we shoot up in the last 1/2 hour as they scramble to minimize losses. I am still thinking a split, a deal or a new product launch that will cause the final blow.... Could pop up to 250 before we are done."
How can shorts be confident Pepsi or Coke won’t buy this company for $420 per share? Growing Alt beverages are an attractive category. All my girlfriends drink la croix to avoid putting on weight. They also like how it pairs with vodka.
Time to move on
AAPL and Tesla went up 20% and fizz has not moved much.. people will slowly start coming in to buy!
lol him and musk must drink the same water
"Purchased around $55 with the mind that it was too good of a deal to let pass by. Saw it crash to $40 (-27% unrealized loss) but surprisingly I was very calm about it and not worried. All the bashing from the news and the lawsuits that was unable to prove anything truly negative about the company or their products only caused a hit to their earnings. When the bashing slowed and stopped, earning reports were getting increasingly better again which proves to me that they have a very strong and loyal consumer base and pulling along new customers along the way. I'll keep my investments because I do believe that if all goes well with the overall market that FIZZ will return to record high levels again."
"Trending up in a down and uncertain market. 50% short interest on the open float. Stock split at 4 or 5 to 1, new SP 14-17 dollars, 10% dividend on new outstanding shares($250 million payout) $305 in the bank.... Making $40m a quarter.... Business segment is on trend, COVID enhancement..... take home beverages in high demand. new PE raises to 30+ as a new growth story comes into view. Pre split rises to over 80 with squeeze, post split 20ish and then 30 with new PE evaluation. movement today says it is coming very soon..... friends and family buying on the wispers.... Past is repeating it self again. Who cares is they only have La Croix.... it works."
Have to pay the Dividend before the Dem's get back in office. They will raise the taxes.....
"last night on ""This is Us"" they showed the family purchasing La Croix at the grocery store. Nice free adverting."
Well that was quite a day... Have a great weekend everyone!
"Sorry Fizz fans, this is coming back to earth. A normal share price will be 80ish. Still solid company, but the short program is over. All shares covered and now more short shares being taken out at these high prices. This will be dead money for a while. I would get back in around 80. Still see a possible split, good earnings and another dividend towards the end of the year."
Just bought in for the first time. Been following this one for a while and finally found an entry point
"The market has gotten big enough to attract big launches, brand extensions and advertising spending from many big competitors. What will this companies response be in regards to marketing , packaging etc. If position is not defended la Croix could end up like Rip It."
"it's crazy that most of this stock is owned by the 80 something year old owner that leads to only 20% of float available. That guy can die at any time, what happens we he does and what happens to his shares and this stock price?"
"Short squeeze across GameStop, AMC, National Beverage and Michael’s Craft Store. I like $MIK as 30% market cap is short despite great fundamentals.....recent top and bottom line beats with Q4 earnings release likely going to be a monster. They announced “opportunistic share buybacks” on last call and forward P/E is 10......I am long even without the upside of a juicy short squeeze ahead! $amc $qqq $mik $tsla"
Seriously someone must know what happened
"This stock is about to break out. When it does, hedge funds will start covering their shorts sending us to the moon. Buckle up folks and enjoy the FIZZ beverages."
"Please share this message.Hello everyone,We all know the current hype on the stock market with a high rate of short selling. I'm not saying that GME and AMC are bad stocks at the moment, but there is one stock with a short float of 80% and above that looks really good fundamentally. This stock is $MAC. It's particularly distinctive and I'll save you the financial details here, but basically the market valuation is very low compared to its intrinsic value.You will thank me later. If you want to understand why fundamentally the company is worth it, please take a look at the community and you'll understand in about 5 min. https://www.reddit.com/r/MACArmyBets/"
Lot of catalysts will drive FIZZ much higher: summer coming; potential M/A..
Le Croix has premium space on market shelves but that will change soon as Pep/ Bubly has large marketing budget
"FIZZ is a solid company. Another company, BBRW, may become the Anheuser-Busch of the future with their Cannabis Breweries. BBRW or BrewBilt has successfully developed a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical grade CBD extraction system. BBRW is trading under 1 penny but the stock is gaining momentum with 14 million in volume on Friday."
"As per usual the CEO did not disappoint in his bizarre and unstable approach to the public market process. Having said that, paying out half the current cash is certainly not a bad thing. FIZZ revenues and profits are on a tear right now given the trend in the business segment they lead in, the COVID shopping craze and the lack of raw materials (aluminum cans) allows FIZZ to raise price with not much downside for at least the next 12 months. The timing of the special dividend is interesting as new long position holders or short covering position holders only have just a few days to decide what to do. And, it would not shock me if the CEO( who is the board) decides to increase the dividend when there is no time to cover causing maximum pain. There is no financial need for FIZZ to keep that much cash on the balance sheet given there earnings. He must think he is going to live forever or that taxes are not going up, or he is more foxy than we all hope he is and is really going to inflict some pain to the 70% holders of the open float that are short."
Keep dropping baby ...... I love buying opportunities like this.
New LaCroix flavors will be HUGE! Get the beach umbrellas out so they stay cold in the sweet summer sun.
quick 5 up off low--lucky buyers under 120---nice job
What is happening here?
"As a separate note, Tis the season and based on the fact that Fizzle has at least $200mil in the bank( close to $5.00 share) and is still making good money, I would say it is time for the owners to pay themselves and the outstanding shareholders some of the cash. History says the announcement will come out soon and be payable in Jan. So I can see Ole Nick paying himself and little Joe at least $4.00 a share or close to a 10% dividend. Time to cover and buy some shares to collect the Dividend. Merry Holidays."

@Stock Investor - Have you ever made money on a stock? You don't seem to understand how the market works. FIZZ doesn't have to compete with Pepsi and Coke. It can continue to sell to a niche market and generate returns that crush Pepsi and Coke. That's exactly what FIZZ did for the last 30 years. You need to educate yourself if you don't understand this simple fact.
over 50% of float shorted... is this the short squeeze coming?
Pepsi Bubly is the winner vs Lacroix
Why is there a 2.5 million short position out of a float of only about 11 million shares?Hedge fund positions? Anybody know?
"don,t follow,until market near stable, hope within $38 to $44 at least."
"Bought DEC 18 calls at 94. If stimulus comes, and the company reports strong earnings should be solid."
Is earnings even today? Lol
"sold this this morning, good fundamentals but can't hold any longer... maybe I can rebuy in spring"
"The short trap ends today, looks like someone panicked a bit at the open. It takes 3 business days to close a trade. If he raises the dividend, they will have to pay.....My guess is earners will be spectacular and we will see a nice increase."
Does fizz have its eye on the CBD market? Fizz is a good company to do a merge like apha tlry for the synergies.
Made some good coin on this but not risking Monday..with all the options expiring today this could quickly flip on its head as the underlying shorts cover during the expiry mayhem...given 40% is free floating there will be a lot of profit taking...remember hogs get fed..pigs eventually get slaughtered..learned that lesson a few times...not going to get too greedy..its been great
"I think that if come in ,must under $38."
"Hope the CEO stops buying his own stock so it can fall naturally, I would like to cover at around 60 for the remaining of my position. Hope to do that in the next few weeks."
"You have to understand that FIZZ is a tiny $4 billion dollar company that is 75% owned by one man. In fact, only about $800 million in market cap is available to trade. So there should be no surprise as to why the stock price is volatile. But if you can handle the volatility, there is plenty of upside in the stock over the long-term."
"I guess all of you are unhappy cause you all lost money and are just feeding your negativity into believing the price will fall farther - now is a good time to buy, down over 50% from ATH"
"Coke discontinuing Dasani Sparkling Water I think helps LaCroix. I saw it as a direct competitor. The ""AHA"" product has caffeine in it, which many health conscious types who drink LaCroix are trying to avoid or cut back on caffeine."
ain't that too much for the CEO to be getting almost 10 mn. in compensation exluding any stock options
Do they have any deals in the works to partner up with any of the cannabis companies to develop THC-infused beverages? Seems like a match made in heaven.
"Where can I get the buy vs. sell volume details? Like a breakdown of the overall volume, how much was buy vs. sell?"
Cover while you can. The market will come back a bit and this goes to 200 before the close.
"Earnings are out , they are excellent, set new all time records, also released statement of the 3 new flavors, it’s the best introduction ever any previous intro’s, they said to expect great sales from them, FIZZ can easily go up 20 points or more with the float that’s available and the amount of Short Shares of interest now at 47.51 % of the float."
"I’m loving this slow, steady rise upwards. Seems primed to keep going, and based on market activity recently, only a matter of time before people realize the short interest here and start to fight back to get this back to its justified value. 83% of the float is shorted, meaning there are almost twice as many shares owned than really exist. This is going to be nice!"
Stock Investor likes losing money
"wow, i blinked and when my eyes opened, it was down 5%."
"So, the run is over, the short play is pretty much over, what to do now. The broader question is trying to predict how the company will do and what the market thinks of that. They have a declining soda business that will not improve, they have a declining sparkling business that will become less profitable and may start growing again in about 6 months after the overlaps are based on current trends. They have a very weak management team. Dishonest, no smart, don't value people. I would say it will be the same as it was for 30 years. Make decent money, 1 person owns 75% of the stock and pays himself dividends, won't sell because in his mind he still has a 6 billion dollar company. My guess is the CEO either dies or completely loses his mind and his family sells the business for whatever they can get because they have been waiting for that for a while. In other words, dead money unless you think getting a couple of bucks per year in a special dividend is a good thing."
WOW! Excellent results.
"Whatever you guys say..... I have made a nice profit on Fizz and I will look at it again before earnings when it is under 90. What is a 1b company worth these days? 3x sales, maybe 4 in this space. I have now turned all my attention to OMER. That will be 100 soon then 600 in the next few years.. Watch and learn.."
"Ralph - You seem to know this stock well, your current thoughts?"
Any insight regarding timing of special dividend
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-beverage-corp-declares-dividend-223800804.html
"Nice move today. 3x the market increase. Large volume suggests shorts are trying to start the covering. did anybody notice the first of the big special dividends today? Costco is paying a $10 dividend for shareholders of record on Dec 2 to be paid by Dec 11th. The Fizz CEO will not be so generous with the timing as he hates shorts and wants to burn them by not having enough time or stock to cover there positions. I added more to the 12/18 call options today, doubled that. Nice icing on the cake. Still calling for the squeeze of all squeezes. I cannot figure out a formula to equate the SP vs the option value. Anybody care to take a stab."
I think'est we may be on the road to $ 60.00 before too long.
"Let's focus on the facts. Sales have been decelerating for six consecutive quarters and turned negative last quarter (20%, 17%, 15%, 13%, 7%, -3%). Please explain how FIZZ will reverse this trend. Competitors stealing market share is what caused the deceleration. What can FIZZ do to reverse this trend? Slashing prices may increase sales volume, but it will also squeeze profit margins. Sorry folks, but this stock is going fall a lot further."
"This is looking like a pretty good re-entry point. Total revenue growth has gone down but it is still solid, profits continue to increase, company is now making 250m a year in profits, will have close to 200m in cash by the end of the year(2.00 a share) very little debt. Input costs continue to raise, but that can be recovered. So a the very least you will see another Div in Dec for 1.50 to 2.00 a share. Short percent is still very high, but perhaps now is the time we see FIZZ sell La Croix to Coke. I could see them getting a special div of 35$ a share and the company being left with there non core brands, which with the plants still have value of around 15$ a share. Lots of different ways to go. I don't see much downside in owning this now."
Quarterly results are out!! i will quote:Best quarter ever!!Net sales 292mil $ 11.3% increase from lasy year (very nice figures)Gross profit is at 171mil $ (21.4% increase from last year) !!Net profit increase by 17 mil to $51 mil Earnings per share increased 49%!Cash is at $353 mil an increase of $150mil from the last 12months!!!Do i smell a divident coming back?For a small soda company these numbers are incredibly good!
"Nice article over the weekend about Amazon ""is going to crush La criox"". Giving away the 365 private label sparkling water to over 100 million prime members. As I have been saying for quite a while, this move is bigger than anything Fizz can do. Only option is to lower the wholesale, and ruin margins. Just wait for the other large retailers to follow. They will all have to get on board to compete. fizz will be down 20% this week, does not matter is they post a good quarter. They cannot stop the retail industry and because they do not have good relations with retailers the it will only make it worst. Looks like I am going to be able to cover my shorts this week."
"Ivan, actually believe it is the reality that WallStreetBets crowd is learning the difference between what shorts as a percentage of all shares and shorts as a percentage of float. Even though FIZZ has a very high percentage of shorts in terms of float, not so much so as a total of shares. If the price climbs high enough those tightly held non-float shares become very liquid and end up stopping the short buster activities that the Reddit crew were attempting here and were very successful with at GameStop, of course over 100% of their total shares were short."
National Beverage is up 6.13% to 44.84
"Coffee sparkling water? I can't wait to try some when it is 10 for $1.00 at big lots. No brain power left over there. A slow death is now presenting itself again, just like on everything else. Shasta, well you can still find a big bottle at dollar tree. Wonder how much money they make on that, Rip it energy, Dollar tree, same as above. Next will be La Croix. The chance to sell has gone by unless they offer it real cheap to KDP which would not be the worst thing for Nick(76% of the stock), at least that way he could get something for it. But he won't because he just does not do things like that. Pretty soon it will be like it was for the first 30 years..... No body cares, but he has run out of time.... Hope someone buys the whole thing to take them out of there misery. sad to watch unless you are short......"
lol what a joke a beverage company priced like tech do your due diligence.
"No idea why this would be going down... Great sales and profits, positive trend in the category, 350 million in cash soon to be $400million history of paying that out. The stock is not overpriced at a 24 PE. So I am going to buy more....."
Why is it dropping?
"Pretty nice move today considering a down market. Last day to pick up shares for the special dividend and last day to cover. The volume is what I would consider light under the circumstances. Tues/Weds will be the painful day for the shorts(7 million shares) as I am betting the CEO boosts the payout which will have to be covered. In addition the earnings in the next 10 days will exceed expectations and will continue all the way thru next year. I can still see a spilt, again driving the share price higher.. I am looking forward to collecting the dividend, closing out my call options in Dec and taking some profits before the end of the year. Truly a spectacular holiday season. I think I will donate quite a bit of the profit as i really don't need it as much as so many others. Maybe the CEO will share some of the 650 million dollars he has collected over the last couple of decades. You can't take it with you and he could do some real good....."
"Fizzy should be steady as she goes thru the rest of the year. Lot's of cash on the balance sheet and it would seem to me that we can expect a Christmas dividend of at leasts $3.00 a share. Possible incremental positives: Sale of La Croix to Coke, innovation( not likely from this management team). Possible downsides.... Market correction, FIZZ would follow( buy the dip) something happens to the CEO is in the mid 80's.... No crazy PR's lately so perhaps he is keeping it together and keeping his hands to himself...."
"60% discount price from highs with nothing serious enough in my opinion to warrant the fall? Doesn't concern me what people say here, I'm not even trying to get in at the bottom, I'm just getting in. Good company, good product, still no real competitors in the sparkling water market even though some are trying with not so successful results."
"Not an investment professional, don't listen to me, do your own research, not providing advice, etc.So, researching the short borrow rate fee, finding conflicting data. Here is a nice site, and you can look at various stocks to see how much they have to pay in interest to borrow a stock. From my reading, a typical interest rate (APR) is 0.30%. For Fizz, here is recent data:https://iborrowdesk.com/report/FizzSo, not insignificantly higher, especially for those in at the 3.2%. Compare this to some of the other stocks that my hit a squeeze:https://iborrowdesk.com/report/jillhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/nakdand of course the one everybody is focused onhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/gmeYou can get a sense of how it expensive it would be to short any of the above three. Fizz is less expensive to try and short. I'd still suspect a runup, because investors just don't sell this stock often, but I also wouldn't expect this to be GME. Regardless, this is a nice site (i'm not affiliated with it at all) for data that can be useful in making investment decision and doing technical analysis/DD. There are many other pieces of data besides APR that can impact a short, and if you look at AMC you can see it can change in a heartbeat once people decide to snap focus on a stock.Info to use at your disposal. For me, I only invest what I can risk, am comfortable being long for now given options expiry date in Feb I think there are several weeks of action to come with this one and am in no rush to leave. Hope everyone else is learning a lot through this process too, and remember to protect your principal.Investing involves risk, do your own research, I am not giving investment advice. Sharing to learn together."
FIZZ is down -5.22% to 99.31
"It has been my experience with this stock that when you see movement without any real news in advance of a PR( upcoming qtr) that someone is whispering good news. It is clear that revenues and profits will continue to be stellar given the COVID dynamic. It is also clear that they will now have $350 million dollars in cash or over $8.00 a share. Historically this has been paid as a dividend which benefits the shareholders of which the CEO is 75%. In addition the BOD agreed to an incremental 250m shares of common stock(5x) current share count. So I see really great earnings, a 5 for 1 split. These two events should move the stock to 85. At the same time as the split a $1-$1.50 per share post split dividend pushing the stock up again to 100. there will be a 5 day window for this all to happen because the CEO will want to crush the shorts. My guess is that they are already starting to cover because the writing is on the way."
Short squeeze has merely just started.
"Sinking Fizz fans.... Don't know why the BOD authorized 250m shares and they only used 46m? This action was not enough to hold up the stock price. I may consider buying after the split and before the earners in March. they will be good, but who really cares now..... I could see another div this year and even another split. Wish he would have been more aggressive. the window is closing for a better MC opportunity"
"OK, what's causing this to go up another 5% today? I'm liking it as a shareholder, just considering taking some $$ off the table. Would love to wait another few months, so I don't have to give Uncle Same a bigger cut."
"With the drop today, I loaded up on some 4/16 110 options. Solid earnings with increasing EPS means they are raising prices or shifting more of the production mix from low margin to high margin with 9% revenue growth. I don't see any of that changing rather continuing to move ahead of that pace. So, depending on how you feel about where this is valued today, it seems like 95-110 SP over the next 6 months. After I close out these options, I am going to take a break as there are other more interesting stories now that the cash has all been paid out. 750 million of the billion to one person, wow..... not a bad side business for a construction guy. Hope he gives it all away.... It could do some good. You can't take it with you."
FIZZ may be the next MONSTR beverage stock!
just not understanding how a stock with a short ratio of 25 and positive earnings showing growth can be so weak and low volume.
"I’ve had this company long term since I think 13 dollars. It’s a nice company and they send you samples of new drinks with their annual report. Which is a nice touch. I’d have likes to see more people stay long term, would have been nice, but I get the game."
fizzy get dizzy
LaCroix is a great product. But don't forget about Shasta soda. I love the Orange flavor 4 pack cans from Dollar Tree.

"You wouldn't believe it. I recently received a delivery from TD bank. I was wondering what I was and when I opened it, I saw a box from Lacrox. Inside the box was two cans of their newest product and some documents thanking me as a fizz holder and outlines their marketing strategy and plans. Fizz is really taking that extra step to make their company better than ever. I am more LONG on fizz that I ever was before"
"hoping to see over 1 million shares bought back this Q, was just reviewing the financials ahead of earnings, I think its definitely a possibility, I think they could definitely hit .70+ eps this QWith the number of shares shorted, a decent buyback and a slight beat will cause a nice short squeeze"
This stock has no volume and just moves all over the place. If y’all just hold the line then it’ll go up
"The short interest on FIZZ has gone up to 57% of the outstanding float. Almost 7 million shares. The average daily volume is around 280,000 shares per day. Great earnings coming this week, continued growth based on category trends and COVID lift, a pre approved increase in common shares of 250m( 5 for 1 stock split) and 350m in cash to be awarded to shareholders after the split means the shorts now get crushed and this thing pops to insane levels for the period between the announcement and the actual split and dividend date. there is no control on the downside for a short position. What a set up..."
National Beverage has outperformed 81% of all stocks over the past year. That's crucial because research shows the market's biggest winners tend to have an 80 or higher RS Rating as they begin their biggest climbs.https://www.investors.com/news/national-beverage-hits-80-plus-relative-strength-rating-benchmark-2/?src=A00220
"It is odd that Nick has not taken advantage of the large amount of cash on the balance sheet. In the past very consistently he has taken advantage of the lower dividend rate to pull all the cash out of the company(he owns 76% of the stock). Yet today with another qtr in the books and almost 300million on the books($7.00 a share) he has not pulled the money out. Why would he not do this? First, let's agree on a fair value of this company. Clean balance sheet, (no debt), solid but declining earnings which will continue, failing sales. 1x sales, 10x earrings puts this at a market cap of 1.0b to 1.3b or 32 dollars a share. 33% below the current share price. Add back the cash and you are a little higher. If Nick who is at the end of his life wanted to take the company private since there are no buyers, now would be the time to do it. At the current share price, this would cost him about $350m above the current cash in the bank, or about 8 qtrs earrings. He could also finance this either with his personal wealth or take on a some debt. Either which way, he is either going to let the stock price fall which it will or pay the 25% surcharge and do it sooner than later depending on how much time he feels he has left.... So, I think this goes lower still, then ends within the next year, or he just pays another big dividend fairly soon. The one thing you can say about Nick is that he is a very creative financial planner. No so much on the branding and marketing side. If we are judged by how much money we make, then he is a success, I think there are other values much higher, but this is a stock board......"
"Did anybody else get totally F'd on the special dividend? I have everything in my portfolio set to ""Re-invest Dividends"" by default. And guess when this special dividend hit my portfolio? When the stock was at its inflated $162 / share price."
"CRUSHED it. Q4 EPS of $0.77, $0.17 better than the analyst estimate of $0.60. Revenue for the quarter came in at $262.4 million versus the consensus estimate of $246.27 million"
Earnings to be announced within the next 24 hours...
Pepsi coming
"Awfully volatile for a soda company, even if an opened can of Lacroix maintains its fizz longer than competitors. Their smaller boxes fit nicely in store shelves. CEO makes 2X competitors with similar caps. So performance is expected, but not to the neg. side."
"fizz is such an usual stock at this point in time. You cannot use the normal guidelines of trying to estimate what the stock price is going to do. Normal business cycles, PE, debt radio expected earners, business trends. All those point to a stronger than normal situation which would push the stock price up at a normal pace. However digging into the details will reveal the fact that we are sitting on a rocket ship ready to take off. Who knows how high this will go. It is hard to predict the pressure the short squeeze will have as there is no limit on the loss of a short holder. Let's take a look at what we know. Today Fizz has 400m dollars in cash on the balance sheet. That is almost 10$ a share of a 10% special dividend. They could easily borrow next years expected earnings $150-200m and include that in a payout. That would be $12 to $15 dollars a share. Now that we know the election is over, there is a huge incentive for the CEO to pay this out as he owns 75% of the shares. The only other reason to hold that much cash is if he is planning on taking the company private. For that there would be at least a 25% premium he would have to pay as a 75% holder. Back to the short squeeze idea. There are now almost 8 million shares short or 70% of the open float of the stock. That is a situation that is so volatile is you are short that it is hard to predict the amount of loss you would have. To add insult to injury if you are a short holder and a special dividend is offered you actually have to cover the cost of the dividend in addition to the loss on the position. in the past when the CEO does this dividends he allows a 5 day grace period of shareholders to accumulate shares or in this case also short holders to cover. between the interest in a 10% plus dividend at a tax rate of 15% which will be going up next year and massive covering to avoid unlimited losses you have a normal 20 day covering cycle pushed into 5 days. My plan will to sell on day 3 or 4 and I would estimate that it will be in excess of 130 dollars a share. I would happily give up the dividend payment for a larger move on my long position. I also have 12/18 calls that are already up 300% and expect those to add to the gain. The next few weeks are going to be incredibly exciting if you own this stock long."
"FIZZ year-over-year sales growth over the past six quarters: 20%, 17%, 15%, 13%, 7%, -3%. The deceleration isn't a recent phenomenon. Number don't lie."
with the stock continuing to get beat down I expect to see alot of share buybacks from the company at these rock bottom prices
Real simple go on amazon and buy a 12 pack of lacroix sparkling flavored waters like i just did for $20 bucks if you really want to squeeze this stock into the 300's..Blow out the earnings to blowout the short hedge funds and larger shorts..the ceo is an old man in florida running an amazing company-why short his stock endlessly when the product sells out!!!!
Glad to see this moving... one of the only green in my portfolio right now
I thought earning were supposed to be reported yesterday?
"Fizzy fans..... They are selling La Criox to Coke. 70 dollars a share cash deal for share holders. The short squeeze is only 10% done, 6 million more shares.... 170."
wait wasn't this 100 usd last month?
They are growing and have a forward PE of under 15 the share price could literally double.
Can someone explain what this “special ￼ dividend” is? Thx in advance.
Will the shorts need to pay the stock dividend to the shareholders they borrowed from like a cash dividend.
Quiet board considering all the activity of late.
"$CELH Vanessa Walker, CMO Celsius (former $FIZZ CMO) named to 31 leading women in beverage industry https://www.bevnet.com/magazine/issue/2018/leaning-beverage-31-powerful-women-industry"
What's your favorite FIZZ product? Which products or flavors are a protective moot (Warren Buffet style)?I tried the LaCroix Cola and Sparkling Lime. Pretty good stuff. Lots of competition and price markdowns.Got my feet wet and bought some shares recently. So far so good.
"So let me get this straight.... 1) FIZZ last earnings was a miss and the next earnings is even greater expectations...2) FIZZ is facing increased competition... namely from Pepsi Co's Bubly, which if it doesn't stifle FIZZ sales growth, it will almost certainly impact FIZZ profit margin one would think.3) FIZZ denied providing an SEC regulator with requested clarifications.. regarding a secret proprietary 'method' used to ""set goals"".4) FIZZ CEO is under scrutiny of Sexual Harassment (at minimum a great distraction to leadership)5) FIZZ is being sued for misleading investors (apparently, related to the same thing the SEC regulator asked about.)All this... and there's room for the price to keep going up...??? mmmmmkay. It could... no doubt, but my logic says there's much more reason for this stock price to come down rather than continue going up. Furthermore, if I am some entity like Coke, I'm not offering to buy FIZZ without some resolutions regarding the matters listed above, and I'd probably just wait for the price to go down before even discussing the possibility of buying FIZZ.But, I welcome any of your genuine thoughts or criticisms... I would love to hear why some of you think FIZZ will continue going up in price in the short term. I'm just not seeing why it should. IMO, there's just no way FIZZ is going to face all I've listed above and still have such great growth as to overcome it all and meet/surpass expectations..."
"@Stock Investor on Thursday before earnings - ""I'll be out of my shorts by Friday. How about you?""Also @Stock Investor on Friday following a 12% run. ""Added to my shorts today. Next week will be a great week. If it is up I will add some more, if down I will wait for it go down even more."""
"Volume continues to be about 2x over normal without any news..... Shorts trying to cover without causing a panic and long investors piling in because they know what is coming. If you consider just the tax implications of not doing the distribution this year the amount of money is staggering. Who wants to pay more in taxes if you can avoid it. Again, the business is very strong and will justify a higher multiple on its own. You can't even find La criox in the major box stores right now as the shut down craze is repeating itself again. But the massive move up has nothing to do with the positive business trends. It is all about financial engineering. We will cross over 100 today. When the plan is revealed the stock will go up at least 20 percent on that day. Run shorties run. no where to hide."
The stock dividend is actually pretty clever. Simple math shows 46m shares outstanding and about 4m short which means there are about 50m shares in circulation. The company will issue 46m shares as a dividend which leaves 4m shares to bought out of the float which after the dividend is issued is 16m shares. Basically this will reduce the short interest by 2m shares pre-dividend.
"Empirical data shows quite opposite of what some have suggested in their posts.Fizz sparkling water unit retail pricing is up not down latest 4 and 12 weeks and only down .5% last 52 weeks and with the strongest unit dollar share in the category! Further strong performing companies such as FIZZ,Coke,PepsiCo hedge months sometimes over a year in advance on different raw materials to protect themselves against market fluctuations"
"Closing my short position around June 1. I like coming back in about 2 weeks before the next earnings release. I think sales will be down, but margins will be good."
Is this a Public or Private company.????Most companies release information on the top managers. Like education and experience.Why not FIZZ? If anyone knows anything please reply. I think this is a family business that pretends to be a public company.Seems like the same last name of top company people.Can not find out anything about their education or what colleges they went to.
"Yikes, this is really setting up for a big short squeeze. They will have to pay the dividend and doing a split will make the stock more attractive. When you have one owner that has 75% of the stock, they tend to take it personally when people short there companies.... This CEO will enjoy hurting people who have bet against him. The sales in the sparkling category are very strong, and even with competition they will get there share. With all that cash sitting in the bank, this is going to be great if you are long right now."
DOWN ? this is a gift. This should easily hit 60+ long before years end. The LaCroix new flavors should easily take it to that level alone.
I see why the Fizz stock is down now. Polar signed a deal with KDP to produce there polar brand nationally adding another layer of competition. It could hurt but really not that much. This is a buying opportunity for Fizz. The pie is getting bigger pretty fast and it does not matter if the slice is a little less. As a matter of fact it increases the chances for a Coke buy out. I am going to buy more today.
"Was in Costco yesterday. They have a coupon on the curette for an average cost of 2.16 for an 8 pack. At Wholefoods it is 4.99. So I am sure that the sales on that are quite large but the cost of doing that will be millions of dollars. I am sure there is still a profit in a promotion like that but it will be dilutive to the companies margin and it will force them to offer more aggressive pricing to other retailers that follow the market. As I have been saying for quite a while, decreased market share, lower the prices, margins go down........ Same old, Same old. Who would want to invest in a company that has one owner with 75%, low growth, decreasing margins and no innovation because the management team is weak. This is just a cash generation machine for one person. Should be private. The only upside would be that he takes it private and pays a 25% premium to buy the shareholders out. No one will want to buy a brand that is on the downslide. This is going lower.... and then nobody will care just like before La cox blew up. They should change the name to National Fizzle......"
It’s nice to see bad management get their comeuppance. Even better when you have a short position. Thank you.
Question: Why would stock price go down when ex-dividend is tomorrow? I would think people want to load it up -- asking @newbie
"Earnings should be good, forward guidance maybe too optimistic."
"New data out. Still over 4Million shares short as of 1/29. So it went up to $196 from 3Million shorts covering, let's see what it does when the other 4Million+ cover :D"
"Hey everyone, to make no share available for the shorts to short, set your shares for sell at GTC with limit price at 1000 or more so that your shares would not be in the loan list from your brokerage.The squeeze is comming.

"Costco just the latest retailer to launch a private sparkling water, 32 cans for 7.49 vs 24 cans of La croix for 6.99. Costco does big volume for FIZZ. All other retailers will follow. Too much pressure.... Plus looks like the management team over there has issues with the SEC among other things......."
Easy short
"Less than 2M shares traded today. Even if every trade was a short covering (which of course it's not), there are still over 5M shares short. It's more likely that some of them doubled down today, and this is just getting started. I love the 1 year chart, the cash position of the company, and the company's plans. The short interest is simply a bit of icing on the cake. This one will go back past today's high soon, I bet."
Down over 7 percent on no news....or did I miss something?
"Trying to figure out what is going on here..... Business trend is good, making around 150m a year, 305m in cash( most ever on the balance sheet) net cash is 250m after debt, 50% short on float. BOD authorized 250m more shares( split 5 for 1 ?). The CEO is either getting ready to split the stock and pay a large dividend or taking the company private which would have to be at a 25% premium to where we are now. He is getting old and needs to do something special very soon. This is going much higher either way. I am going to buy some options to leverage my long position."
bank of America and royal bank increasing their positions oin fizz... why is the stock falling so much today?
Is this a Public or Private company.????Most companies release information on the top managers. Like education and experience. Why not FIZZ? If anyone knows anything please reply.
"We still have 2 million shares to go. We have some naked shorts here, so the margin calls will be starting soon. Forced selling hold your shares and buy more. The pressure will be incredible."
53% of float is short. I feel a squeeze coming on
Interesting the two for one split right before earnings.
Why is this dropping?
This company is undervalued. Waiting for it to leg up again. I love the large insider holdings!
Company can’t even do earnings properly. What a joke of a company.
This could be a 100% plus short squeeze just need one big buyer
"FIZZ is absolutely mispriced by market players:EPS 69%, rev up 17% only missing by a little at bottom price range."
i think fizz might have reached its lowest limit and that a surge may be possible. do you gals find it dificult to see thru the hype attemptng to drive prices down.
"The great thing here is that it's a nice couple percent up each day. Today, on only 300k volume, it's up 6%. There are over 7M shares short, so imagine what this will do if/when they try to cover."
"I have been doing instacart (Grocery Delivery) here in ILLINOIS throughout the chicago area and La Croix has been in very high demand and sold out often in many stores, im working 50+ hours a week so i see a lot of stores. Do what you will with this info"
FIZZ pps is being kept on the low side because of secret talks with cannabis companies when cannabis becomes legal in the United States a merger will go through. Wonder which cannabis company this could be?
Game shop has already almost recovered the entire AH panic. FIZZ will follow suit. We will end up higher for the rest of the week.... It is about the math... no way out.
"my 80 dollar calls are happy. All of this with all that cash, spilt coming and big dividend , plus stellar earnings. Could hit 100 or 20 post split with over 200m shares authorized by the BOD at the last meeting."
FIZZY GET DIZZY
"I now see what is happening here. Last week Fizzy dared the shorts to cover because the CEO basically said, the 6-7 million shares that are short and going to pay. They have been paying a lot of interest for holding the shares short, they have to pay the $6 dollar dividend on Friday no matter what. He is saying, we have 200m more in cash, we have a unused credit line and no debt, that our sales and profits are continuing to go up, that they will have at least another 600m in cash by the end of the year( $12 dollar dividend) which could be even higher if they leverage themselves. And, don't forget they have already approved a new share count of 250 million shares which means a 5-6 to 1 share split which is normally meaningless except for whatever reason it makes stocks go up. So what we saw yesterday as what we saw with Gamestop is the firms that are holding the short shares and trying to get out. Thing is we have about 5 million more shares to go this because the float is so small, we will see some crazy action at least for the rest of week as they try to get out and get the retail investors to let there shares go. Remember the CEO holds 76% of all the shares and he is not selling unless Coke pays him for La croix which I still think is a possibility. Hold onto your shares or buy more as this thing is one of the best squeezes I have seen."
Went up 12% last week! Excited!
All of this move today is on like 500K in volume. Monster potential.
"Frankly, I like a CEO with some skin the game. 75% ownership is high, but it seems unlikely he will be content with letting this drop into non-existent levels. If I lose 25% i know he felt it too"
Today's drop was too structured and too orderly. Gap down tomm or next day.get ready.
Still not sure how this justifies a 15% drop...https://seekingalpha.com/news/3510896-national-beverage-double-digits-poor-nielsen-numbers
"National Beverage is one of the few companies that emerged from the coronavirus recession relatively unscathed. The soft drink maker's revenue and earnings grew every quarter over the past year. On Thursday, National Beverage (FIZZ) earned an upgrade to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 70 to 73."
"There you go. fairly easy to predict...... Increased the dividend to $6.00(could have been more)... paying himself a tidy sum...... and the 7 million short shares have to cover 42m.... Got burned pretty good. cover time is over. I closed my options today at a 400% gain. I am selling my long position tomorrow. I believe the next earnings will be good, but I believe we are fairly close to the peak.... What a great and predictable ride. I am sure the CEO is quite happy today with the thought that all those shorts got roasted like that. Unless Fizzy does something really interesting all the hype is now pretty much gone and the company is fairly valued for now. time to move onto a the next deal...."
rough quarter
A little cannibus will put the fizz in national beverage corp. Great Target for a buyout when marijuana becomes federally legal. I believe this is why the split is coming soon.
What just happened to drop the stock 6%
"looks like a Biden win.... more taxes means, a big div is coming very soon and I still think a share split. Shorts are going to feel quite a bit of pain..... I have shorted this stock in the past and made a lot of money. Now is the time to be long and take positions with options."
"Nothing to see here... ibb(.)co/ZTrj53xBuy the dips and take their shares to slow down their manipulation. A lot of short interest needs to cover in the next month, be patient."
Good Day
"I am new to this but the stat sheet for this company looks good, why would it continue to fall... will good earnings make for a strong move?"
I've never seen this thing trade in such an orderly fashion as today. It normally has some spike of drop of 75 cents to $1 within 15 minutes sometime during the day.
what's happening in after hour?
"@Stock Investor - “Daddy, my robinhood account got suspended”"
I'm surprised FIZZ has been unstoppable daily for so long. Every time I keep thinking that it's too high to buy and yet it just keeps going up.
Confused / How can this upcoming stock split be done like a dividend. Unless they are giving a one to one stock as a dividend. That would be a dividend and not a split. Like I said I'm confused. Anyone have a possible answer. Thanks
