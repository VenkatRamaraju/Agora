Principal Financial is down 4.98% to 39.90
I feel like we are getting teased. It's time we climb over 60 plus and move toward the 70 per share normal.
"New to this board. Why is this one down so much today, comparably against the broader market?"
This to will pass and I'll continue to buy a little each day it drops
"I did very well with RGA, UVE, and AFL. Now adding a position in PFG, the risk/reward is just too favorable to ignore."

Wall Street stupidity at it's finest today.RBC downgrades the stock after it already has fallen almost 40% this year.It never ceases to amaze me just how utterly ridiculous this whole game is.

Whats with all the liabilities?
"This may not be a popular post for many however I've been with pfg since I received 141 shares free when they went public in 2001. I was given the shares by pfg, as well as other individuals that purchased life insurance and other investments with pfg as a show of thanks. The free shares varied based on the length of time and amount of investment with them prior to going public. Based on that I've followed the stock ever since and have seen a starting share price in the low to mid twenties and a high as much as mid seventies. In 2009 I believe, during the crash, it dropped to a mere 6.43 per share from a previous high of 70 something. It's always ranged in the 49 to 60 dollar range over the course of its existence. I missed the boat when it went to 6.43 in 2009 and purchased as many as I could averaging down chasing it from 20 to 10. I simply, like many, ran out of cash. That being the case I never, ever lost hope or worried I made a mistake. Sure enough within about 4 to five years it saw it's old glory days of 70 plus yet again. I was hoping, this collapsing market would allow me to conduct unfinished business, another chance to purchase this stock below 15 or 20 per share. I'm ready this time with 50k. I've been chasing it down from 40 with conservative buys. Waiting for my moment and benefiting from the scare. If you're thinking about this stock, getting in below 40 is a very sound investment. Below 30 and you're stealing it. This company is solid as a rock, humble and located in the heart of America, Iowa, run by conservative hard working individuals many family related or lifetime employees. Dont be afraid to invest in a stock with a solid past and bright future. I'm literally biting at the bit to pull the trigger on the biggest one time purchase of my life. Good luck to all"

There may be a dip or two as we head toward summer. Anything below $50 is a sound but because by summer it will be in the low to mid sixties. 10 to 15 bucks per share increase isn't to shabby when your local bank will gladly furnish stale donuts and day old coffee if you put 10k in their bank at less than 1% profit yearly. Oh did I mention free checking?

Yield. Now close to 5% so you’ll get your money back in about 14.21 yearsWatch they’ll reduce the div
"Just three years ago this stock was over 70 per share.. not long ago, when you go long. If it continues to drop due to this unforeseeable virus and financial uncertainty for the near future my purchasing will start at 40 conservatively. Goes into the 30 range my purchasing will become moderate. Its goes into the 20 range ill by moderately high. Its goes to 10 and im selling the farm and anything else for the most aggressive purchasing campaign of my life. If you think this trend downward could never happen let me remind you of 2009 when it hit a low of 6.48 per share. I couldn't acquire cash fast enough to purchase what would have made me a millionaire 3 times over. I've waited 12 long years for another opportunity and this time I'm prepared. At the present price it is still a sound investment and my dividend is always reinvested. However if it continues to go south im going to pounce on this stock with such aggression this board has never seen."

Look at the 5 year chart. This stock does not perform Inability to increase shareholder value offsets any dividends.

Just joined the team at $41 today!
"When the stock went down to 6 bucks in 2008 I bought a sh#$ load. I continued buying until it reached 25. It has hit roughly 75 per share twice since it went public. Recently it dropped to low 40's and I bought 1000 shares. Moral to this story.....this stock will hit 75 again within 18 months. Perhaps higher. It's a solid company, refused government bailout money and controls assets worldwide while operating in the humble state of Iowa. Go long on this stock and you won't be disappointed."

Is this a good value play?
I see the trailing P/e is 6.66 is that why the stock is so inexpensive ?Seriously PRU has an even lower P/E like 5. something so why are these very reliable high div type companies selling for such low prices ? Seems most of the experts expect rates to be slowly going higher which would be good for the insurance business
Pfg rose above the one year analyst prediction of 65 per share....p.f.g. PERFECTING FINANCIAL GROWTH

During the pandemic we saw share prices drop to the twenty three dollar range and rise consistently from there. As of this post 18 months later we are enjoying a sixty three dollar p.p.s. today and the dividends are just the icing on the cake. With a p.p.s. of over forty dollars since the low of twenty three and dividends that are unseen by similar investments everything I've said about this stock has been spot on and I hope those that followed my advice are enjoying their gains. Glta.....

"cheap, so so company"
"Still up 14% on the month, it can go down 5% for all I care. Still a good company to me, that is at a good p/e ratio, and pays a good dividend and is undervalued by dcf and other valuation methods."
Has anyone else received an offer of $36/share from Baker Mills LLC? Why the sustantial discount?
"Whisper is 1.33 for the quarter so annual pe would be 9 not very cheap but still attractive with the div. Too much focus on fund management a tight margin business. expansion of Tradition Life and accident insurance may help margins... Low debt low payout with a small to mid cap. Nice,"
I'm feeling 60. Plus. Come on pfg I gotta car that needs paying off. Stay strong and rise.
Anymore news regarding the purchase of WF's investment unit?

"so, the valuation is decent. earnings are solid. dividend is really good. and it's cheap right now.can't figure why this isn't popping at least 5% off of the $29 per share.what am I missing?"

Cant buy enough of this fast enough. Ugh
Phones and website should not be down at the same time and weekends is when some of us find time to check our accounts. Don't you have failover servers or something to keep the site up?
"PFG is a stock that LOOKS GOOD, and I own it. However, almost all the analysts are Neutral or Underperform. Zacks and ValueEngine, for example, both rate PFG as Underperform. Overall, this is a very bearish stock, according to the Wall Street analysts."

"with capital gains like this, a %4 dividend yield, and only PE ratio of around 11, this might be my favorite stock in my portfolio."
Pretty good so far.
Needless to say a sharp two dollar decline going into the weekend and wiping out the slow climb over the last few weeks that had us over the $55 hump has me fuming. It feels like I have just one butt cheek after today's bite. I hope it's done playing around and we see a few two or three dollar increases over the next few weeks. There is no reason why it shouldn't hold steady in the low 60's.
They lit up times square today for the opening bell. Nice going.
Principal Financial is down 5.31% to 41.56
Within 8 months the p.p.s. will hit 70 plus. 65 is the next hurdle then a steady consistent climb to 70
Why down so much on an up day?

PFG is up 7.68% to 33.36
When it recently dropped to 38 I picked up 50 more shares thinking I would continue to chase it down purchasing even more. Instead ill have to settle for the 5 dollar a share gain cause I don't think we will see this stock in the 30 dollar range any time soon.
"Sure looks interesting here, unless I’m missing something."
Does anyone think $PFG will hit $61?

Thanks to you Mike....i hung on and now I reap the rewards. Pfg is what you say and a lot more!!!!
Would this be considered a hostile takeover?

i will take my 7.5% yield or higher and wait it out. Strong company. Low interest rate environment. Buy the dips.
What does everyone think about Elliot getting in on this
Good entry point at 52. I hope. PE of 9.8. Thoughts?
