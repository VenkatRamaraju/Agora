"Got 5500 more (total 37k) at 3.21, who os selling now think twice its absolutely insane. Once any insitutional got back here will be 5+."
One thing for sure is when this stock moves it 
"Broadwind was one of the first producers of 100-meter wind turbine towers in the United States. We’ve built more than a dozen designs for the world’s largest wind energy OEMs, designed proprietary internals, and custom engineered the high-precision industrial gearing that keeps them operating at peak performance. Today, Broadwind has built thousands of 2+ MW wind towers, making us one of the largest producers of utility scale wind towers in North America."

"Consensus for a profitable Q2 8/2, with increasing demand. Inevitable passing of a trillion + infrastructure bill, weighted with clean energy infrastructure, of which Bwen plays in broadly ,,,,Inclusion into the Russell Microcap index, which expands exposer and attractiveness for ETFs and Funds to add an index stock. Extremely under valued, low float stock a quick x2 and a x3 sooner than later……If you don’t like this stock right now, there is something wrong with you. ;)"
New Thumbs-Up poll on whether this stock will hit $9/share by the end of the year.
Cicero gonna get $$$
Earnings - The way I look at tomorrow is that earnings have a greater potential to increase the depressed share price with a slightly rosier report relative to the pre-earnings than to decrease it with a less sanguine report. The bad news is largely baked in. My guess is we get a bump tomorrow.
"picked up 1,000 shares here new position 6.80"
Been holding this stock for at least 5 years. They use to be primarily focused on building wind towers and fixing the wind turbines but they purchased other companies and expanded their operation. I think once investments in the wind industry pick up this company will benefit.
Revenue 198 million and market cap at 91 million. Wow. Its wall street! Sometime banana and gold is sold at the same price.
"Predictions on when Bwen achieves profitability this year, and impact on the Stock price?"
Sitting here laughing to myself wondering why the share price isn’t as “sustainable” as all that “sustainable energy” Bwen produces lmfao….
"Let's see, where can we find some company to build the towers and gearing for all that offshore stuff?"
Much better than most $4.00 stocks with such a low float. Will see I’m not going unless it really blasts. Getting out of China stuff.
Nice oversold bounce today!
This terd is circling the bowl
"Engie to build wind farm in Texas under Walmart deal10.2019,France-based Engie SA — whose North American arm is based in Houston — will sell wind power from a new Texas asset to Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) under a new agreement.The deal has Engie providing 366 megawatts of power generation capacity to the retail giant from two new wind farms, one in Texas and the other in Oklahoma, according to an Oct. 22 statement by the company. The Texas project, the 300 megawatt Prairie Hill Wind Project, would build a $307 million wind farm near Mart, Texas, in Limestone County, according to tax incentive applications published by the Texas Comptroller.Engie will provide Arkansas-based Walmart with 166 megawatts of power from Prairie Hill, the French company said. The Oklahoma project, Kind Plains, will provide the remaining 200 megawatts under the agreement. Engie also has a deal with Walmart for another 150 megawatts from the Triple H wind farm in South Dakota, Engie said.The deal is similar to the one between Engie and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) that the companies announced in September. It’s also a lot like the many other power purchase agreements between power providers and large corporations supporting renewable projects in Texas. Texas more broadly is building wind power capacity at a rapid pace, much of it covered by tax incentives."

"So what are peoples thoughts on the earnings report? Stock is up, but I am a new shareholder and curious what positive signs (or negative) that people see."
This was $4.xx a month ago...........and people complain of the drop today? Get a life.
"Feds and CA backing wind farms, and BWEN well-positioned to partner. Back to $8-$10 in the next 60 days. Do folks see BWEN as an acquisition target? They have a lot of capacity, but seem to lack adequate QA and organizational discipline/focus. A GE, say, could bring that."
Do tirds sink or float…hmmm
"B's infrastructure plan is swirling in the toilet among bad policy ideas and he knows it. We already started on Plan B which is to buy oil and gas from Russia, and coal from China to sustain our energy demands while we build a bunch of useless wind turbines (which all of the parts and materials come from China). U.S.A. is on track to be non-compete in the energy sector.... but at least our carbon footprint will be zero."
Sleepy want to build windmills inhouse (USA) .
"A guy walks into a bar and ask the bartender, “ BWEN has been walked down easily due to a extremely thin float as institutional investors load for the inevitable wave of sustainable energy development. Now tightly coiled 20 days from ER and consensus profitability. Analyst SP target consensus $10. Resent add to the Russell micro cap index and a favorable admin pushing hard and successfully for massive grid infrastructure spending……should I go long or short?”"
How about a thumbs up poll on whether this stock will hit $6/share by the end of the year.

"Finally some good news. It was only a matter of time that the orders would start coming in. Natural gas production is up and will remain strong for the foreseeable future. This is boon for the gearing division. The Wind market is also growing and more importantly is retooling and upgrading equipment form aging projects. Broadwind is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this market. Many will be tempted to take profits when this hits $5 to $7 a share, but will miss out on what I think should be a $20/share stock in 2019."
"good entry point, huge order book and some conference participation to increase awareness."
"Interesting how little chatter there is on this page regarding this stock. Sure would like to know what people who are selling are thinking? Are they shorting? If so, seems like a vary narrow band of opportunity and that there are better shorting opportunities elsewhere. So what is driving you, if you are a seller?"

This is an extremely undervalued stock with high growth potential.. sales about double the market cap (cheapest in the industry).. Biden’s green energy plan will be a huge growth trigger for the company in the coming years... don’t wait until they start announcing gaining new projects as you won’t catch it at these low prices.. any price below $12 is a gift
Check my posts down below from 3 weeks and 5 weeks ago. Not proud at all to see people lose their cash here. Were now approaching fair value for this stock. Stop letting day traders take your money.
"Shares of Broadwind Energy Inc. BWEN, -3.78% were vaulted 74% higher on heavy volume to pace all premarket gainers Tuesday, after the clean technology components maker announced an order valued at $19 million from a wind turbine customer. Trading volume topped 1.8 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 28,000 shares. The company expects most of the revenue from the order to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company said it now has about 80% of its 2020 tower production capacity in backlog. To put the value of the order in context, Broadwind recorded $178.2 million in revenue in 2019, up from $125.4 million in 2018."

Hey Shorts how's it going?Coming your way:Russell Index Funds adding Infrastructure Bill passing Q2 Profitability
"You all do understand that this company is not a wind company, right? They manufacture anything from ships to wind turbines, but it'd be a far reach to say it is. I hold no position in this but did my research to see if it's worth investing."
"Infrastructure: Snip>""The White House said the deal includes $73 billion for electricity grid improvements, including the building of thousands of miles of transmission lines to deliver power from renewable energy projects, and a new Grid Authority."""
"""The offshore wind sector in the United States pales in comparison to that in Europe, where thousands of turbines are connected to the grid. But wind power is poised to take off along the East Coast, with recent commitments from several states — Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia — to buy at least 25,000 megawatts of offshore electricity by 2035, according to the American Clean Power Association."""
happy to have gone long on this early. now I'm just waiting for the hype parade to arrive :-)
Still waiting to see how that big infrastructure deal effects propeller stand manufacturing company stock price as posted by many individuals on this board…might be waiting awhile ;)
"Congrats to all longs here. Unfortunately I'm not in, but I sure wish I was! GLTA longs"
Count down to profitability (Q2 8/4)
All aboard she’s getting ready too sail
Overpriced. I'll wait until the company is profitable to get in. Solid company. No revenue.
"Nice summary here of the emerging offshore wind opportunity. Note the reference to Siemens (a major partner of BWEN), which is considering the US for the site of its first factory to produce its new 14 MW offshore turbine.https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-2020-has-been-a-surprisingly-good-year-for-us-offshore-wind"
"yeah, everything is fine until one of 10x thousands of off-shore wind towers being installed breaks a pipeline and leaks all that wind power into the ocean."
Bought at 6...thinking long hold?
This is gonna fly
$0.53 per share vs analysts consensus $0.12 ! that's a lot more
Moon right?
$12.89 is going to make a nice new bottom!
Wishing I did not buy in during the green hype. Live and you learn. Hopefully BWEN comes back for me and proves me wrong.
Watch out! Company loosing $3.5M per quarter while cash on hand is only $2.3M. Another dilution coming?
Insiders bought BWEN at $8+ check it out LOL. They all have 500k shares each at $8+ All higher prices than what it is now
"Why has Roth Capital been quiet on this after rating it a Buy in June 2017 with $6 price target? Deal or no deal?! lol either way liking the recent buy activity from analysts, price bounce off the 20 day MA and continued uptrend into earnings on Aug 5th. Wind is going to be big in 2021 with Biden. Bought some and doing more research."
now is the time to buy BWEN as they push you to sell your shares and 1 Trillion dollars switches into Wind Turbines
Earnings seemed alright
This is actually funny at this point!

I know bwen does wind gear boxes for 3 of the 4 American manufactures however I am most excited for Bwen’s heavy fabrication division specifically geared towards infrastructure build outs like bridges etc
I am thinking $20+ on this news
"Heck of good run over the last couple of weeks. It is hard to key in on the next level of resistance, but I am guessing it will not be before $11, which is closing in quickly. After that, I think the high teens and 20s are realistic provided that earns match expectations with the large orders announced in 2020 coming through. While speculative buying on the Democrat agenda has driven the sector broadly higher, it will be Broadwind Energy's business performance in the trifecta energy, mining, and infrastructure sector that will take this stock to the next level."
In not very distant future BWEN will be trading above 14/share.
"I just bought it today. Fair value is 14.40 (compared to its industry), earnings are forecasted to grow 68%, have 1+ year of cash for operations, no significant insider selling, a path for profitability in 3 years, price to book ratio half of its peers. Long term investement!"
"Broadwind to Join Russell Microcap IndexJune 09, 2021CICERO, Ill., June 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadwind (NASDAQ: BWEN), a diversified precision manufacturer of specialized components and solutions serving global markets, with an emphasis on serving clean energy markets, today announced that it is set to join the Russell Microcap Index at the conclusion of the 2021 Russell indexes annual reconstitution, effective after the US market opens on June 28, according to a preliminary list of additions posted June 4.Membership in the Russell Microcap Index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the appropriate growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for its Russell indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings and style attributes.Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Approximately $10.6 trillion in assets are benchmarked against Russell’s US indexes. Russell indexes are part of FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider.“"
"Beat earning, guided strong, minimal short interest, x2 play on both wind and infrastructure. back logged with orders, adding capasity, poised for their 1st full year of profitability and widely held by intuitional investors........Sure, makes perfect sense to be bleeding red for weeks. This has got to send hard!"
Bwen has a low float......it thrives on capitulation and crushing stop losses. It will swing up just as dramatically. The company has a great story and will do well with the push towards renewable energy
BWEN is a wind energy pure play. They are wind energy for the U.S..They will be a driver for new wind power.
shorts starting to feel the burn.
"“The offshore industry is on the point of taking off,” said Amy Farrell, a senior vice president of the American Clean Power Association, a trade group for renewable energy. The group expects 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy to be built over the next decade."
P.S. - See my post from two months ago where I called $8 !
Is this a good time to buy?
"The White House said meeting that target would cost $12 billion a year in capital investment on both US coastlines and would employ 44,000 workers, as well as 33,000 additional jobs in communities supported by offshore wind generation."
"The whole NASDAQ is down almost 300 pts today, so it's not stock-specific. I just picked up a little more BWEN. I think it will be a significant player in offshore wind, as well as other heavy infrastructure. Returning to functional, reality-based government policy should greatly favor both areas. Show some patience. Most of my position was acquired in the $2 range and I think it still has a looooong way to run. GLTL"
Buying! this should be good.....
Got in yesterday!! The company has been established for quite sometime and has good revenue. 60%-70% of their income comes from wind turbines. And everyone knows green energy is the future. This company is going to have lots of orders which they won’t be able to cope up. With such a low share float and good institutional investors in it this company is no brainer for long term investment.
"In the end of june gonna be 5, mark my word"
This stock is headed to $8/share. Decent volume and increase on no news today.
Hope Monday is better.
"I like the fact that the company's revenue is growing and net loss is decreasing.---Revenue 2018 ($125 million), 2019 ($178M), 2020 ($199M)-----From the company's guidance, 1st six months of 2021 revenue is only $90M---Net Loss 2018 (-$24M), 2019 (-$5M), 2020 (-$1M)What I'm concern is:---Is it correct that the company did a reverse split 1:10 on 8/23/2012?---The ended the year (12/31/2020) with only $3M cash of which $1M was withdrawn from line of credit. Is this sufficient cash to maintain operation?"
"wow, since June 18, 98 million in orders announced."
"Another delay in tower deliveries, which blows….Looks like a consensus beat anyway. I’m expecting strong guidance into Q 3 with tower deliveries hitting the books."
The same market perception and industry climate that drove this stock over the last quarter will continue to drive it upward in 2021. Positive news on orders and deliveries will assuage concerns regarding the cash on hand. Congrats to those that bought the dip last Friday morning.
Markets showing much love for sustainable energy and infrastructure.
Broadwind to join the Russell Microcap Index
Monday is Bwen day.......
"Wind tower sections sold, +23% y/yTotal revenue of $198.5 million, +11% y/yFourth quarter results were impacted by a delay in the delivery of a tower order to a new wind turbine customer, lower gearing demand and pandemic-related supply chain disruptions.Is there a backlog at all for Broadwind ?"
"Fair price for BWEN is 6,4 USD. Company has exelent product."
SOLR.V is the best way to go. Bullish on both companies!
This is fast approaching the 52 week low...
future is here
"Solid above average volume to the upside today.....Shorts had their fun, it's steady up from here."
"BWEN is going to be a $20 stock short term, then gap up to $40-60+ long term"
I’m 20% down so too late to back out. No doubt this will all ’blow’ over. Green energy being attacked by the fossil fuel bagholders. 25% of my portfolio is in hydrogen stocks so i’ve took an absolute beating this week but holding on. Don’t believe this is a sincere price correction. End of the month we’ll be back to business as usual
been in since 9 feeling the pain. only thing that can save this is infrastructure bill at this point
infastructure bill will pop this at least 30%!!!
Wondering if this is a good time to load up aka buy the dip?
watched 2 large barge loads of tower sections leave Manitowoc this morning.
"Kurt, don't mean to be rude but all this stock does is go up then double back down."
I think We're closing above 2 today and that is huge. 3 will not be that far away. sleeper stock
"Yesterday the US Intl Trade Commission determined that U.S. industry is materially injured by imports of utility-scale wind towers from Canada, Indonesia, Korea, & Vietnam that are sold in the U.S. at less than fair value & subsidized by their governmentshttps://www.usitc.gov/press_room/news_release/2020/er0730ll1614.htmThanks to SeekingAlpha's Steve Zachritz for pointing this out"
"I spotted this company just today so I'm rather new on its news sentiments. I noticed they have a healthy variety of energy tech for different sorts of customers, renewable energy being one on the list for their strengths. Clearly they'll have a tax advantage from the new Administration, and its strengthened focus on renewable energy will shine brightly. Maybe even open doors to newer customers including government(?), just not sure how well that'll expand within US alone vs worldwide. There were news last year on their increased risk of possible Bankruptcy due to the pandemic. I'm not sure how well that all played out and where BWEN stands today in terms of stability and attraction with investors. Has anyone here been eyeing this company for quite awhile? :)"
Nice AH activity. Tomorrow should be a good day on the upgrade.
BWEN has to move up from here now that the Dems have control of both houses. Yesterday's buyers were smart !

"The reversal starts today. Its about time this beat up stock gets some positive momentum, If we could just get wind power projects in the infrastructure deal, BWEN would be trading double digits."
Any guesses on Q1 earnings Friday? The consensus EPS seems pretty sand bagged. I suspect they maxed out their tower order production capacity for the year. They should be through any past covid impacts and delays. I suspect they probably have the gearing segment back in full production.
next stop $10 a share
Is anyone buying?
Green and Strong volume again with a big accumulation at the end. Watch the volume that’s the tell!
"BWEN stock is finally waking-up after years in slumber, for very good reasons. There seems to be the perfect storm of positive drivers for BWEN, and I expect the stock to continue to climb significantly. BWEN hit $10 the last time the Wind market was strong in 2016/2017. I think the Wind market and BWEN are in a much better position than in 2016/2017. Also to note, the Performance Tax Credit was recently extended by the IRS, which should significantly increase the size of the market for the Wind Towers that BWEN sells. I own a lot of the stock at the time I am writing this. I have my money where my mouth is."
why the jump today?
"@ Ja …. Oh ya, and then there is also the joining the Russell 2000 micro cap index catalyst!!"
This one definately under attack. Just bought more. $11-$13 price target

"If you haven't seen this stock swing on a catalyst, its a thing of beauty!!"

"Hey Shorts, how we doing? Do you all have calendars on the wall in your parents basement? Start marking the days."
5 x revenue = 900 million USD and that is the market cap. = 53 USD per share
"Broadwind is the same Company with the same outlook that it was a month ago when it was trading at >$11. No new news. I am fairly confident that it will be trading back at those levels soon enough. It's been a flashy stock prone to large percentage changes down and up. It's clearly in the ""Buy Zone"" to me."

Recommended by three analysts. Average price guidance: $11
"if you look at 52 week high $9.80, the reason price dropped so low was because customers had excess inventory and orders dried up. now orders have started flowing again and valuation is extremely low on a price to sales and price to book ratios."
Good news for BWENhttps://newsroom.wf.com/press-release/corporate-and-financial/wells-fargo-expands-renewable-energy-purchases
Someone posted about the Manitowoc plant earlier. I know there's been talk around town that they are making some big fabrications for Konecranes that are for the Navy. It was in the local news that they received money from the state for improvements to build it.

"It’s on Vector Vest list of undervalued,top potential stocks to own ."
In for 1k shares hope it keeps this momentum!! Seems underpriced in today markets
BWEN is a BUYOUT Candidate for a Green Hydrogen company imo. At this valuation imo it would be a great get for one of those companies to build infrastructure. All other wind companies are so pricey compared to BWEN.
"Tax loss selling is over, this year should be better"
Three things:1. Investment in wind will soar because of federal infrastructure spending.2. Technology advancement in wind has enabled more energy at less overall cost than coal or hydro.3. The 4 analysts who cover this stock project average price guidance is $10/share. Ignore the loudmouths on this board and remember that the stock market is a vehicle to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient.

"Active board, Cheap stock, very good potential, very minimal risk! Deffo a medium to long term hold, When do there Q4 earning come out?"
"Upgrade today from Roth Capital moving the SP a bit…Raised the target +$2 to $10. When renewable energy cycles back in favor, with a little volume plus this low float, it can swing there in a 3 days."
"BWEN is the best kept secret on the NASDAQ, but will not remain off the radar for long if it keeps posting 30% jumps. At current pricing, this stock is still way undervalued and I think it will be trading in the 20s after Biden takes his oath of office. Full disclosure, I have been long on this for years and waiting for a change in administration to bolster the wind industry. Happy to see such positive movement today."

Extremely undervalued.. earnings are good and the outlook for the remaining year is great.. price target $12
"14% held by insiders 47% of the float held by 52 different funds and institutions. Multi-infrastructure, wind energy play. The low float has made it easy to manipulate for institutional accumulation of retail shares, don’t be fooled, this is a 2021, $10 - $12 stock"

Anyadditional equity financing, if available, may be dilutive to stockholders, and additional debt financing, if available, would likely require new financial covenantsor impose other restrictions on the Company. While the Company believes that it will continue to have sufficient cash available to operate its businesses and tomeet its financial obligations and debt covenants, there can be no assurances that its operations will generate sufficient cash, or that credit facilities will beavailable in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to meet these financial obligations."

Another wind component manufacturer closes…https://news.yahoo.com/south-dakota-rocked-again-wind-043100112.html
i really want to jump in but i cant after 30% gains in a few days. looking for good buy point not sure if this will continue to rocket or not but it was in the 4-5s just a few days ago so i will patiently wait. If it continues to go up i wish everyone the best of luck
Broadwind only needs a piece of the action and they will get it. Understand the project is a long term infrastructure deal. Long Term the numbers will grow exponentially.
"Siemens Gamesa up in Europe, N. American backlog at record levels. GE wind did well in their quarterly report yesterday. Holding strong BWEN!"
Is backlog a useless number? I don’t understand how they can have such weak guidance with $75 mil backlog. The companies cap is only 66 mil.
bwen was $97.40 in 2009 can we go back to the future in this wind mill thing?
Seems to be a bit of a rotation into infrastructure and renewables today.....
Already in summer 7$ maybe 8$ is possible without bigger problems. Future is GREEN and so is the bwen. Accumulation in process.
getting bought back
"Interesting paper on the effects of Wind Project construction on lobster fisheries. The paper concludes that there was no deleterious effects to the lobsters. In fact, their populations increased. I will post the link in a reply."

I fell in love with this stock. I will be with you for the rest of my life.
"Wednesday and Thursday were obviously big days on big volume, but yesterday was just as impressive. This was supposed to sell off yesterday, so I was looking to add more, but it didn't. Even when the vix spiked, and the market sold off, this stock held firm. Every excuse to sell off, but it didn't; so I added above 5. I have a good feeling about this stock."
Anemic volume. Just takes one institution to jump in tolift this issue significantly.
i bought before earnings and am happy with the result so far. strange that the volume is so low though...30k shares traded each day on a sub 2 dollar stock. how do we get that volume up? Anything good coming on the horizon for this company?
Vestas announced a fiscal year outlook of 4.9% above market estimates. Estimates fiscal year revenues between EUR 14 and 15 billion (market estimate EUR 13.82 billion) (Bloomberg)
"added another 1,000 shares 5.70"
"Another interesting and critical advantage BWEN has for the forthcoming mega off-shore wind power initiative, their Wisconsin tower manufacturing plant is a re-purposed submarine plant with it's own deep water port for efficient off-shore tower transportation and installation."
"Been checking this board weekly for the past two years that I have owned the stock and the price seems to go from1.50 to 2.20. That is usually based on booked orders. Kurt seems to be only regular poster, but all this volume and no news from company and reaches 2.49 to go back to 2.14 wonder who bought and sold today."
"How will tariffs affect their business? According to their last CC, the CEO alluded to passing the extra cost onto the customer. However, that brings in the possibility of losing tower orders to foreign competitors. But then again it all depends upon how far the end user is as shipping costs will come in to play. I'm looking to take a sizable position in BWEN as I think their business is going to turn positive in a big way for the next few years, mainly due to the resurgence of energy and mining industries. Wish I had more understanding about the impact of the proposed steel tariffs but still think the risk/reward here is favorable."
"I know the best way to know if a stock will rise or fall: If I buy shares it will 100% fall, if I sell shares it will 100% rise. Good times"
"The way this stock behaves doesn't make sense. No Momentum, if they are expecting a decent quarter they should announce something. Has anyone contacted their PR Department for any updates?"
"This getting ready to move up big...Love to all,T3"
"Time to buy more, everybody wants a 2000% return the next day If you believe in the concept and the company than holding or get outRemember Tesla was once at $7.00 And look who’s building up the road that will use wind and solar Yep TESLAMore"
There’s no loss till they go out of business The wind is always blowing
"......I'm thinking this runs up to 12 shortly, then once they start announcing orders and post a profit it cleans 20 with ease. 2 Qs of profit and this could go many multiples from here."
Solid above average volume to the upside again today…Accumulation going on and heading right way.
am in today green energy is the future
"Small, but good company. The price is low. Fair price is 8$."
Sad Chad and wrong bet Juan (Short & Shorter) Not sure your short case around wind not being sustainable will hold.
Earnings beat
"I don't care if it goes up 10% today, will not buy any more above 2.50. Once it hits 2.50, I'm doubling down and I won't regret it."
What are the next catalysts?
BWEN is the perfect stimulus play... bridges and roadways... and wind they have 3 of the 4 american turbine manufactures as customers... what will 1.9 trillion do to sales
"JinkoSolar- (NYSE: JKS), one of the world largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers,Mark cap only 3B , 2020 sell around 5 B One of the cheap stock in solar"
power beat !!! to the moon!!
This administration is handing Gold on a silver platter to companies like this. Now it’s up to management to turn it around.
There is a low share count here. Would not be that hard to get this one moving with people on board. Just needs volume!!
"This could be the next plug power, fuelcell, vestas, enphase stock!I am loading some stocks longterm!"
"5.20 is the technical support point. back in december the upside was too fast from 5.20 to 7 so there was a gap there. Now it is filling up. As long as it does not crash 5.20 downwards, there is a big opp upwards. 5.20 is also the 200MA point hence should hold. It is a good point to enter and bounce backs from MA200 points generally are drastic."
i will try to jump in. great buy.
Is there any news responsible for today's jump in price?
"well, this is the beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning but the clock just started, and reality is better than fantasy, the first move to $12.44 in January was nothing. Reality is about to happen."

"Bullish New York (CNN Business)Investors managing more than $41 trillion in assets are loudly calling on world leaders to immediately step up their climate game if they don't want to miss out on a wave of clean energy investment.More than 450 major investors signed a letter that was released Thursday urging governments to set more ambitious emission reduction targets, detail ""clear"" road maps to decarbonize pollution-heavy industries and implement mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements.We're in this together. Investors can't address the climate emergency on their own, but governments can't reach climate solutions without investors.""The letter, signed by Fidelity, State Street and other influential asset management firms, marks the strongest call yet from investors urging governments around the world to take bolder steps to fight the climate crisis. And it comes just as the leaders of G7 nations meet in the United Kingdom to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and other major global issues.""These gaps — in climate ambition, policy action and risk disclosure — need to be addressed with urgency,"" the signatories wrote in the letter.The not-so-subtle warning is that countries that drag their feet risk being left behind as investors send their money elsewhere.""Those who set ambitious targets in line with achieving net-zero emissions, and implement consistent national climate policies in the short-to-medium term, will become increasingly attractive investment destinations,"" the letter read. ""Countries that fail to do so will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage."""
Still holding this growth stock.
"Wind turbine technology is the best source of Green Energy. Icy conditions hurt wind turbine but other then that its the best. Solar is # 2. Too much work to make pannels. Fuel cell etc comes may be last. For winfdTPIC, BWEN, CPST are the best play."
I'm thinking of selling at a loss guys. I'm losing faith in this stock. Thoughts?
"Don't believe me......""The bipartisan proposal allocates $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.""That's broadband, not broadwind!! LOL...save yourself...jump out now before you jump out later!"

"Hey Shorts, how's it going? Why do you think is this on a slow and consistent green rise?"
It’s needs a a lot more CPR to raise this company up. Next announcement from this Administration will need to focus on electrical infrastructure and we must vow to do it without fossil fuels.

Way undervalued. This company has so much orders all the way until next year. Funds are pouring as more states increasing their wind power capacities. The growth prospects are huge and share price will be at least $20 next quarter.

"If and when Biden wins, I would think this stock will take off."
"This stock has a huge amount of short interest. No wonder it can't get any momentum to the upside. Almost 13% of the float is short shares. By the time the next earnings release, which is expected to be on the positive side, or infrastructure bill is passed this stock could be under 2 bucks. We need help from reddit or some large institutions to get this thing back on track and burn the shorts."
"2021 to be first year with positive forecast earnings. Wind energy grants extended to 2024. Accounts receivables are up 50% and accounts payables down 30%. Compared to its peers (Atlantica, etc.), BWENs pe ratio is about half so room for growth. BWEN is also heavily diversed and is hedged with sales and operations in oil/gas as well. Management is incredible, Wharton and UMich grads with decades of experience. Wind is a much more effective play than solar (source Uilliinois sustainability study) and utilities providers prefer wind over solar due to its reliability. Solid overall company in a hot sector."
wind farm for renewable energy! go $BWEN
completely agree that BWEN is a very very undervalued stock. I am not sure why. Holding a descent position and will stay strong.
"hey guys....just did a good chuck of DD...question(s)1. Other than COVID impact, are their any other concerns in the near term? 2. The Price/Sales ratio seems fantastic.....peer comparison..fantastic... /P/B...etctoo much competition? near term REV concerns in oil/gas? appreciate any feedback/opinions..."
"What a gem, an undervalued catch-all for building renewable energy infrastructure. They already own a big chunk of the onshore wind tower market and are positioned huge for the forthcoming wave of offshore towers. They touch infrastructure, solar, and even oil and gas....this is going to grow and this correction appears to be a gift."
"Don’t give up on BWEN , However, to truly gain ground, electrics can’t just imitate conventional cars and trucks — they’ll need to overtake them in terms of price and performance. That’s one of the lessons of wind and solar power, which became the dominant source of new energy around the world — and are poised to become the largest sources of electricity — because they are cheaper than conventional power plants. In some markets, building new renewable power costs less than running existing coal generators.leave it alone and sit on it , wait, patient’s is key to this one"
"Hey Shorts, how's it going? Sweet upward volume today!"
Sneaky & steady accumulation!
Anyone know why this stock has increased so much over the last 3-4 months?The EPS has increased from -0.04 EPS from Q4 2019 all the way to 0.06 EPS in Q1 2020.Trying to figure out how the earnings and stock price have increased the way the have in recent months. Anyone know?

been holding since 9 might have to hold another 6 months to break even. but i know this has a bright future. if we see infrastructure bill abd some orders this will see 14 easy this year
Craig-Hallam initiates coverage. 8.00 price
Shorts pounded the ridicules weak guidance......way to blow crushing earnings and perfect positioning to exploit the current political climate...Brilliant! This should drift up slowly from here until the next catalyst.
I am a long term investor here. Bought the stock a long time ago to see it drop and be in the red for a while. All of the sudden started to go up and up and up. What is the reason of that?

Don't panic.
"It would be interesting to know the story behind those who are selling. When did they buy? Are they just taking a loss? If they are taking a profit, then they had to buy a while ago and certainly passed on better opportunities to sell. Just seems at these levels that it's not worth selling. I'm holding..."

"Busy Board ! It is very telling that there is now so much activity on this board. For many months over the last several years, the post frequency was a few a week. Glad to see the interest on both sides. The more bashers and negative posts tell me that BWEN is properly on the RADAR. Congrats to those who bought and held when the winds hit the doldrums."
Company Insiders have been buying lately.. something positive is in the horizon.. no way the price will remain that low
why are we down today? Is the pre Q4 that bad? New to this stock...Can the longs provide some comments?Thank you
