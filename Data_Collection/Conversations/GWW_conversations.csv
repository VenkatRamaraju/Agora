Granger threw me out when I tried to buy for home. when I own the company. didn't know I was not allowed to buy for home. took company account and left
A lot of chatter about Amazon disrupting various business models. I believe Grainger and others will be able to combat this in the long haul. Where you going to go when you really need service?
GWW reached a new All Time High at 313.02
Got out.. We will buy back around $315
This stock will probably start trending down tomorrow
"When something breaks at the factory, and the VP is breathing down your neck, you dont care if its slightly cheaper somewhere else, you call and see if the branch has it and get in the truck and drive to Grainger. By the way larger customers can get the rep to give special quotes. Amazon and others dont offer the engineering data that the Grainger catalog and website do. Perhaps Amazon can crush them on a 60 mfd capacitor, but see if Amazon has a 5 hp 460 volt 3 phase Delta TEFC 900 rpm continous duty electric motor in stock which can ship from a distribution warehouse today.PS: I still think they may be acquired by Berkshire Hathaway or Amazon. If you dont understand what I wrote above, then you have no experience doing industrial purchasing and dont truly undertand their value proposition."
I dont see any buyers right now only holders and sellers
one model shows an intrinsic value of $157/share.another one showing $108.This goose is cooked

"There's no denying that GWW's stock is getting crushed at the moment... For holders who had this around the highs in 2013 ($276) or even last year, it's a very painful hit of about 40%. I've been there with other stocks and it's no fun. With that said, although earnings are off about 8% as compared to 2013, free cash flow is about the same as 2013 and they've decreased the share count by about 15% over the past 4 years, meaning they're actually bringing in more per share. It's a challenging environment, but I believe the company is still doing right by the shareholders and I don't believe GWW is worth 40% less than it was 4 years ago. I think it was likely moderately overvalued then and is moderately undervalued now. Their balance sheet is still rock solid and they have a lot of flexibility in their operations as the current shift to a more competitive model is showing. I see the current pricing pressures hurting everyone in the short term, but over the long term shaking out the smaller weaker players which will be a boon to the larger players including GWW (even with AMZN now in the game). The current free cash flow yield of 6%ish should ensure at least those level of returns (+ dividend so closer to 10% when compounding dividends) over the long term from here, considering the current P/E of 15ish which is reasonable. Just my unprofessional $0.02. I bought today in the $168 range."
GWW reached a new All Time High at 282.00
Supplies prices are still much cheaper on Amazon for the exact same item. Eventually the high prices at GWW will catch up to them. Its only a matter of time. I moved my purchasing to Amazon and am now saving allot of money. And don't hand me the Grainger value proposition because it is totally false.
"wow, a more than double in less than a year? That's amazing for a company of this size..."
GWW beat is huge testament to the overall economy.
This will clear $295 before the next earnings.
W.W. Grainger reached a 52 Week high at 361.93
Grainger gave $100 million to University of Illinois and got naming rights to Engineering Department. How wonderful! How long do you think it took them to recover those funds? See latest news to find out.
Good report and guidance.
why big drop?

Way overpriced. Grainger must begin laying off these employees that have been there for way too long to cut costs.

"Analyst Actions: RBC Capital Lifts W.W. Grainger PT to $240 From $230; Maintains Underperform RatingBY MT Newswires— 11:44 AM ET 01/25/201911:44 AM EST, 01/25/2019 (MT Newswires) -- RBC Capital raised W.W. Grainger's ( GWW Loading...Loading...) price target to $240 from $230, while reiterating its underperform rating.According to the broker, the company's rebound hit another speed bump in 4Q18 with an operating miss, light 2019 guidance including sharply lower gross margins, slowing December sales, and costly digital investments needed just to keep up with the ecommerce market. ""We expect volume outgrowth to continue to slow without the boost from price discounting. Factoring in these negatives and GWW's relatively elevated valuation supports our Underperform rating,"" said RBC."
"this is the slowest message board on yahoo, even the spammers dont post"
"They lowered guidance before and now they raise guidance. Are they taking a cue from other companies who lower guidance one quarter in order for management to get shares on the cheap then have an “unexpected” beat and increase guidance where they dump, wash, rinse, repeat?"
