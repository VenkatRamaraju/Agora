GWW reached a new All Time High at 313.02
"There's no denying that GWW's stock is getting crushed at the moment... For holders who had this around the highs in 2013 ($276) or even last year, it's a very painful hit of about 40%. I've been there with other stocks and it's no fun. With that said, although earnings are off about 8% as compared to 2013, free cash flow is about the same as 2013 and they've decreased the share count by about 15% over the past 4 years, meaning they're actually bringing in more per share. It's a challenging environment, but I believe the company is still doing right by the shareholders and I don't believe GWW is worth 40% less than it was 4 years ago. I think it was likely moderately overvalued then and is moderately undervalued now. Their balance sheet is still rock solid and they have a lot of flexibility in their operations as the current shift to a more competitive model is showing. I see the current pricing pressures hurting everyone in the short term, but over the long term shaking out the smaller weaker players which will be a boon to the larger players including GWW (even with AMZN now in the game). The current free cash flow yield of 6%ish should ensure at least those level of returns (+ dividend so closer to 10% when compounding dividends) over the long term from here, considering the current P/E of 15ish which is reasonable. Just my unprofessional $0.02. I bought today in the $168 range."

Another bad decision competing with themselves Gamut .Dump the whole management team and fast.
These guys BADLY need new management! It’s getting embarrassing that they don’t know the right direction or moves to make.
Need new management team and quick.Some of these managers and district managers have been around too long.Need activist on board.

"They used to have good management. Then they hired Andy Darpino & now he's a Director of Government Accts in Northeast. This bald head, toupe wearing, tattooed idiot would have been better suited collecting garbage for a living. Can't understand what they see he in him."

"Stores are closing nationwide. They want all their customers to order online. They cant keep up with other resellers, yet their prices are the highest in the industry. Dinosaur of a company with executives earning good salary & sales reps doing nothing, but staying at home. Company Will Fail!!!!"

3rd Qtr. Earnings disappointed.
Close the B&M stores. No need for them. Sales can work regions from home.
"This pullback is a gift for this stock. They have been consolidating contact centers, distribution centers, and getting rid of some of their legacy brick and mortar stores. Zoro tools has been killing it with the discounted items online for Grainger. After this reorganization, putting them current, they will be more streamlined and have more competitive pricing. They recently changed their pricing and had an uptick in sales. This is a gift at this price!!! BUY"

Granger threw me out when I tried to buy for home. when I own the company. didn't know I was not allowed to buy for home. took company account and left
Heard GWW couldn't handle the Techni-Tool business and sold to Test Equity....Any truth to that???

"First sears, then most likely JCPenney and will GWW follow in line? Amazon is killing the retail sector. This stock was in the $370’s. Lost about $100/share. Those people working there who depend on their stock for retirement might have to think again. Will they follow those sears employees/retirees into an uncertain financial future?"
"Horrible company. All the sores are closing down. You must have a stock number if you want to order something, since all the sales reps and phone people are not knowledgeable . Their prices are very, very high for a place that offers no service."
Price gouging during a pandemic.... Nice going Granger... great way to gain public trust...You suck !

A lot of chatter about Amazon disrupting various business models. I believe Grainger and others will be able to combat this in the long haul. Where you going to go when you really need service?

Grainger gave $100 million to University of Illinois and got naming rights to Engineering Department. How wonderful! How long do you think it took them to recover those funds? See latest news to find out.

"Analyst Actions: RBC Capital Lifts W.W. Grainger PT to $240 From $230; Maintains Underperform RatingBY MT Newswires— 11:44 AM ET 01/25/201911:44 AM EST, 01/25/2019 (MT Newswires) -- RBC Capital raised W.W. Grainger's ( GWW Loading...Loading...) price target to $240 from $230, while reiterating its underperform rating.According to the broker, the company's rebound hit another speed bump in 4Q18 with an operating miss, light 2019 guidance including sharply lower gross margins, slowing December sales, and costly digital investments needed just to keep up with the ecommerce market. ""We expect volume outgrowth to continue to slow without the boost from price discounting. Factoring in these negatives and GWW's relatively elevated valuation supports our Underperform rating,"" said RBC."

I guess all the new england negative employees and customers complaining about prices for last 4 years had a point.
This stock will probably start trending down tomorrow
GWW beat is huge testament to the overall economy.
What a beast. Stay strong longs.

Good report and guidance.
"I must say the extended losses in GWW's stock price has gone deeper than I anticipated. I am willing to buy more if it dips below $160 to average my position down from the mid-$170's. I'm still confident this will rebound at some point. Sales and profit growth would be nice, but I think stability in both should be enough to start increasing the stock price slowly from here. Their profitability metrics are still somewhat solid with ROE (26%), ROA (9%) and most importantly ROIC (13%), although they have trended down slightly over the past couple years.If you want to collect this quarter's dividend (I believe $1.28 this quarter), be sure you're in the stock by EOD (August 9th). Best of luck longs..."

"When something breaks at the factory, and the VP is breathing down your neck, you dont care if its slightly cheaper somewhere else, you call and see if the branch has it and get in the truck and drive to Grainger. By the way larger customers can get the rep to give special quotes. Amazon and others dont offer the engineering data that the Grainger catalog and website do. Perhaps Amazon can crush them on a 60 mfd capacitor, but see if Amazon has a 5 hp 460 volt 3 phase Delta TEFC 900 rpm continous duty electric motor in stock which can ship from a distribution warehouse today.PS: I still think they may be acquired by Berkshire Hathaway or Amazon. If you dont understand what I wrote above, then you have no experience doing industrial purchasing and dont truly undertand their value proposition."
Grainger should move higher given the disasters !!
Amazon sells many items at Granger taking the edge off growth. More preditory Amazon value destruction
"Amazon does not need this company as it has successfully penetrated the market. GWW has a weak internet offering and Amazon is stealing the small business area. GWW is basically the Sears of the business. In the hottest building market, GWW has marginal growth and failing margins. Company has been buying shares to prop up the share price."

Time to send Mike DeAngelis out to pasture. He's been here for almost 30 years & DOES NOT work anymore - Just gets paid. He actually works no more than one day per week
Supplies prices are still much cheaper on Amazon for the exact same item. Eventually the high prices at GWW will catch up to them. Its only a matter of time. I moved my purchasing to Amazon and am now saving allot of money. And don't hand me the Grainger value proposition because it is totally false.

"They lowered guidance before and now they raise guidance. Are they taking a cue from other companies who lower guidance one quarter in order for management to get shares on the cheap then have an “unexpected” beat and increase guidance where they dump, wash, rinse, repeat?"

"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you deserve losing money in this stock. AMAZON IS THE REASON IT IS GOING DOWN."
"Bad decision by inept executives. They are doing the same thing that IBM did few years ago: Making expensive share buybacks with debt to artificially improve earnings on the short term while the business is in decline, instead of massively invest directly to improve the business itself. They have spent so far (since 2015) close to $1.5 B in share buyback, all borrowed money. Ridiculous. And they have solve nothing, except to close many Canadian stores and the Columbian division. No doubt Amazon is eating their lunch and removing shares won't stop that, neither their little tweaking with their biggest customers. If that $1.5 B had been invested to improve their business model, the stock price wouldn't be in a free fall. Wake up before it is too late and stop pouring more money in the money pit of share buybacks."

"Now Gamut and Zoro- they must have to protect the high margin Grainger proper site business by creating all of these offshoots. Is it really that much business to where it's better to create all these entities, rather than just fixing the Grainger site and moving on. I'm assuming they have drilled thru those numbers correctly... Can you imagine being a Grainger customer and having to check 3 different sites to see which division has the best price today. lol. it even sounds ridiculous."
This will clear $295 before the next earnings.
