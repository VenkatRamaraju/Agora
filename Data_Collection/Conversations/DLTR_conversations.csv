"If they can’t manage freight expenses now, next quarter is going to be worse. Freight companies are raising prices due to fuel costs and labor demands for higher wages. Not good.￼"
Excellent report coming!… Load up now. Looking for a return to $120.￼
"With all the hype around corona, this is going to skyrocket with more purchases for sanitary and other items"
Going to $101
"@A Yahoo User: Now, are you beginning to believe in my analysis? The breakdown I wrote about yesterday that you personalized is taking place. It's not even gone halfway yet. I don't fall in love with stocks, and I don't hate the. I just analyze them and trade accordingly. The money is the thing. I'll buy DLTR at $85, and I'll sell it at the right prices."
How could a profitable retail store chain with a PE of 11.5 that miss earnings estimate by a penny go down $12 is beyond me.Hold on to your shares.
Gotta love these buying gifts when they come along. Easy money to be made.
"Someday, perhaps if the Demos pass their give away budget."
This stock missed the opportunity for a rebound today. It means it will break down tomorrow.
I guess inflation and rising freight costs will weigh on this stock for a while. Down $1.44 on an up day
Lost 3 billion in valye cause they missed by a penny???????????????
"Covid, consumer sentiment, supply chain, labor shortage, and inflation all weighing on the sector in general. As a contrarian, there is no better time to buy. I suspect with fiscal stimulus coming DLTR will surprise on the upside."
"Wow, what an opportunity here. Watching this company for quite a while now and this seems very overblown. I go to the DLTR's in our area, approximately four of them, and they are always busy. I've also noticed that over the years the offerings / quality has been improving. Exited my position in AMD and i believe I might have found my next stock of choice. Good luck to all."
Dollar Tree's Profit Grows 45% in Second Quarter
"After big & olli debacle. I am reconfirming $69 support on this. Not a fan of this, but 69 be good entry for slow run."
To all Longs and pumpers and dumpers. You may chop around here for a while but you are going to 0 with this $1 novelty niche model. Read my previous post and you will understand.There stores are to small to sell $3-$5 products. There is not enough margin to justify rent paid for locations. Before you listen to these pumpers you might really think about DLTR. Goodluck in your trading.
What a bargain. :D Buying and waiting $$$
Time to get in! This will be higher in the morning. Maybe a few bucks.
Selling short now.
"Man, I bought some frozen doughnuts - 6 for $1. Keep them in the freezer and pull them out the night before using, or 1-2 hours if just using a couple at a time.Tastes just like a Krispy Kreme! What a deal.Picking up another 500 at $88.33 in ira. Will ride to expected $110-120 in the next year."
looks like holding up above 80 pretty good
lesson learned ... don't buy a company that beats earnings.
"This company grew earnings, profits and reduced debt despite missing the street expectations. This is a rather large drop for a company that is profitable and showing growth."
"Who was the Rocket Scientist who was talking about downgrades yesterday?... well... there were 6 firms that came and re iterated their recos.. NOT ONE SELL... lowered price for sure... but all buys or mkt weight.. lmao, at U buddy!!... any downgrades, were weeks ago.. THE EARNINGS REPORT WAS GOOD.. this is a company in transition, and its turning the ship to calmer waters.."
If a national retailer everything cheaper than nearly all competitors can barely eek out a modest profit when the government is literally sending money to people in the mail!!!! than when can anyone expect their stock to go parabolic??
Easy dip buy for a quick gain.Dltr is strong as an ox even in a recession and especially in times of inflation.
Get rid of FD and this rises. FD been chocking DLTR since it was acquired. DG glad they didn’t get it
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHE3
Is DLTR sustainable with the shift to online shopping?
employees have no reason to stay....most other places are paying $2 or more dollars per hour for 5x less work....this store concept is not sustainable long term...
$80 is the bottom. It's dipping below $80 on occasion only to bounce back. All of retail is down and this will surge next week.
Goodluck all longs watching those people fall off those AF transport plane is going to be like watching DLTR a $100 stock incredible.
Approaching a 15 PE ratio
What did I tell you people? $80 was the bottom and my calls are looking great.
"Holy cow this is the perfect buying opportunity, shares on a silver plate right now."
Let’s start this turn around this week
"All I could say is wow, I was not expecting that much of a hair cut.Acting like a tech stock that missed earnings by 20%."
This is dropping 6 times as fast today as DG
I'm in at an average of 86 and for some reason I feel really good and calm about it
Need at least 1 self checkout register machine in your store like safeway or walmart and profits go way up. Lines so long people put stuff back #$%$ off and leave.Its as obvious at chipotle adding a two dollar shredded lettuce option and profits and sales go up fifteen to twenty percentBitcoin plays before they tripleMara riot maybe even cctlBuddah
"From $1, 2,5,10,50,100...etc. Electronic signs for the name and price changes. Make sure they can run up into the billions."
Oversold
mass hiring event this weekend indicates store demand
Any other longs here?  Curious to hear your reasons for staying in the stock… I am having second thoughts after reading a lot of compelling bear drivers for the business going forward…
"I think the downgrade for DLTR is more than justified, and I don't say it that often. I own DG, and it is the better of the two dollar store chains. DLTR is being bogged down by freight and wage costs that it is going to be unable to pass onto the customers...all of this will eat into margins. If you own DLTR I highly recommend selling this and investing in DG. IF you look on a year chart DG has by far and away outperformed DLTR. I of course am expecting thumbs downs for this comment. Long term DLTR is ok, I just would rather own DG as it doesn't have the cost problems DLTR does."
Looks like Dollar Tree beat revenue and income estimates by a mile!! :)
Nice day! Hope it continues tomorrow!
"Ouch, at least we did not close at the daily low"
all these pundits predicted dollar would decline bc of inflation.....wrong...glad I bought.
DLTR seems like a no brainer as the economy slows and people are laid off. But my big concern is the amount of items they sell sourced from China. Anyone else concerned or have any thoughts about this issue? Thx Mike
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
Down 10% on a 20-25 cent reduction in guidance even though they have beat estimates by 64 cents over the last 4 quarters. Looks like conservative guidance that will be beat.
will it climb back to $100??
yeah I just bought another hundred shares of it yesterday at 84 something. I'm sure that the buyers are going to step in at this price or close to this price in the next couple sessions
Why go to the Dollar Tree store where I can buy it on Amazon or eBay Sam's club Walmart.. They deliver it to my doorstep.. Just saying.. I know it's at a discount now but I'm here to make money
"This company is a piece of junk compared to DG. DLTR near the year and a half lows and down 11 percent today, DG down only 4 percent near the all time high and has outperformed DLTR incredibly. I know I’m going to get tons of thumbs down but DLTR has gone nowhere while DG has gone to the moon. Have fun DLTR longs I’ll be over in the DG discussion."
"this is just a slight correction, the stock will start rising again this afternoon."
"The turn around is happening now... It has been going on since the recent mgmt change. As interest rates and inflation rises, fedbux cease to exist, consumers will be looking for alternative ways to stretch a buck.This is the best option for that, imo.. now that they are looking to bring in aspects of the DG model, with some higher pricing, numbers will get better over time. there is no one else in this space that offers this type of retail bargain.. and, no one else will enter it andbe successful.. I hope the stock goes lower, so I can buy more.. itz cheap here"
"min wage went up, profits are way down...and most stores are converting section of store to 3 to 5 dollar items to try to compensate"
Guys earnings were better than expected. I don’t understand why this is down. It’s not making sense.
"Numbers weren't nearly as bad as to warrant a 12% price reduction. And, as far as going forward, because no earnings seem to be good enough, the trend is turning to ""under promise""."
"Price came down, bought today for 40 k."
This is as good as it gets CNBC wow just incredible
"With the mkt at $90.58 bid, to $91.20 ask... I fail to see how ""Down $5 at the open"" is anything more than an off the mark prediction, or a bald-faced lie..."
"L....the DT stores in my area are all full, deep lines, all registers. They need to installed more lines and hire checkers !"
"FYI, Dollar Tree just upgraded to a B rating with a recommendation of Buy from Charles Schwab. That’s positive news."
"Dollar Tree should have never bought out Family Dollar, what a disaster this stock has been!"
We better pull this up. Just invested all my life savings
It bounces off of 69. I think everyone should wait for that.
Hopefully that was the last major dip
Thursday or Friday will be above 93.
"Chris, i can tell you, as an invester and an employee of FD I have reserched $ Tree extensively, although it is on a low now, it is one of few markets that will have less damage from the tarrifs and recessions, and will rebound faster., also doller tree is starting new stores that sell thing for more then $1, not raising prices, just adding some higher priced items."
"Would be a great opportunity, at this price, for the company to begin its buyback !!…PE ratio is under 17 using companies $5.90 guidance which started this ugly sell off. Good Luck All "
I'm in at $82.80
One of the main problems is the pay scale at only $8.00 an hour. Many stockrooms are stuffed to the gills as there is no help to restock the shelves. Why should anyone want to work at that low pay while just flipping burgers is now pay much more. In talking with a few Managers in my area that is the main problem as Corp will not budge with a higher hourly wage.
largest drop since March pandemic.. grab dip.. $DG only down 4%
"one trade, 471k shares at 90.93"
"Initiated position in Dollar Tree today. 300 sh.Dry powder for more if it dips more. This is a good, stable company. No dividends, but rich weekly options. I'm here to make $$. Which, in this case, does grow on tree."
"I feel bad for people who think this stock has a positive future. Look at it, for months, it struggles to even stay around $90.00-to $100.00. Can't seem to rise much above that, as the market keeps climbing. I am not pushing any stock, but DG is eating this companies breakfast, every day. Do your deep research, back and forward and good trading to all!"
"wow, everything from Nov 2020 is gone! May have to Start a position when it breaks through $90!!"
"I remember buying I phone screen protectors at DLTR, for $1, plus tax.. I bought 2 to see what they were like, then I went back and bought 6 more... Verizon charged $25 plus tax for the same thing... even 5 below, charged $6, plus tax, for a samsung one which was grossly inferior to the DLTR product.. pricing power??.. I think thatz a YES!!"
Funny I read a lot of posts on here about low income people and the dollar stores.....You would be surprised how many high income/wealthy people shop there too......How do you think they got wealthy in the first place? Good income? Good money management? Good investing strategy? Saving money?
"If they are earning 4-4.5 dollar per share per year, why can’t they give dividend? I didn’t follow this stock from long time but bought 100 shares at 80.50 and want to know if I should keep this for long term"
What is up with DLTR? I am cheering the stock performance but am far less excited by what I have seen in the stores. I have been to 3 stores and the shelves are empty. One was so bad that I asked if this location was closing. The story I got from each of the stores is that they can't find stockers. I hope that this is an isolated problem. You can't have earnings without merchandise.
More downgrade of today :11/27/2019 Loop Capital Lower Price Target Hold $94.00
"Opened a position today. In at $99.18 USD. This will be a minimum 5 year hold unless something drastic happens. As Warren says, “be greedy when others are fearful.”"
is this new normal: worse earnings - higher stock price? nice short candidate
"DTLR needs to raise prices (even just 5-10%, still very affordable) on some of their items. Hotel 6 hasn't been $6 for a long time. What can you buy for $1 nowadays?! Besides, as long as it's not priced over $1.99, it's still techically a dollar store."
I don't know anything about the stock but I do know that I love shopping at the Dollar Tree.
I believe this is a great buy.
"The next batch of margin sales will be 1:30 p.m., then 3:00 p.m. You'll ask how I know these things? See my CV (Resume)."
The stores are packed every time I'm there and the shelves are bare. I can't Harley restock fast enough. I don't get it.
"Several other brokerages also recently issued reports on DLTR. Morgan Stanley dropped their target price on shares of Dollar Tree from $105.00 to $101.00 and set an “equal weight” rating on the stock in a research note on Friday, June 1st. BidaskClub upgraded shares of Dollar Tree from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research note on Thursday, August 2nd. Atlantic Securities upgraded shares of Dollar Tree from a “neutral” rating to an “overweight” rating and set a $110.00 target price on the stock in a research note on Monday, August 13th. Citigroup started coverage on shares of Dollar Tree in a research note on Friday, July 6th. They issued a “neutral” rating on the stock. Finally, Deutsche Bank dropped their target price on shares of Dollar Tree from $112.00 to $94.00 and set a “buy” rating on the stock in a research note on Friday. Two investment analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, fourteen have given a hold rating, fourteen have assigned a buy rating and one has issued a strong buy rating to the stock. Dollar Tree presently has a consensus rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $102.87."
China deal will be announced today
got to load up at this price
Earning numbers are great. It will be up at least 5% during regular trading today.
"Weak short holders are covering, giving the stock a semblance of strength. Wait until the margin sales kick in around noon. Then it will be time for it to go to $85 or so. I'm being frank."
soon trade deal will happen and stock will move higher ...morgan target price 107 ....... holding 2000 shares ...........
Wow!! Super earnings. Beat top to bottom. People are going to the dollar tree stores and the same stores raised. Good day ahead guys..
"to me, business is a business. If a company is ran right and profitable, that's all that matters.We will be pleasantly surprised is just a few hours."
Dollar Tree is a bargain at this price.
I just bought 500 shares after hours. This stock got hammered way too hard in my opinion. Hoping for a nice rebound tomorrow. GL to Longs.
"Calls for December 105 strike, been holding for 3 weeks."
The common man is tapped out on credit card and other debt
Are you watching the margin sales going on now? I told you so some while ago. It's Friday also.
load for rebound. imho..
"You just have to be honest with yourself: when do you think the turnaround would happen? Dollar stores also have a staffing problem now. They have to increase their wages to attract workers. They will be in competition with the big boys , and they have a thin margin. I'm being frank. You may not like what I'm saying."
just look at the history of this stock after a miss usually drops around 10 to 12% and then a month later it's higher then it was before the release
"Hello : This is a great opportunity to to buy at a discount, a company that does well especially in economic downturns. Remember both the rich and poor shop here."
Will tarriffs affect this store?
"Right now there is a lot of positioning going on by both the Bulls and the Bears in anticipation of the earnings report being issued on August 26th. We can only speculate in our own trading strategy to buy or sell depending on whether it will be a good , bad, or a non event report. If any one has some interesting bonafide information that might be helpful, I’m sure this board would be appreciative of you sharing this with us. Thank You and good trading.  !!"
good luck all longs this is as good as it gets. LUV YALL
"You got to love this, markets down, DLTR & DG goes up. Manipulation at its best by the big boys."
"If no one has said it yet today I will. DLTR has BOTTOMED!!! Today's HUGE 3.3% move higher on double normal volume has set the table for more gains ahead. Look for move to 84 and change within the next few days (half way to 50 day average). Then more back and filling and within the next 2 weeks, a move to and ABOVE the 50 day average. The economy is booming and that means more $$$$ in people's pockets. A new Dollar tree opened just 10 miles away from me about 4 months ago. Store is always crowded!! People LOVE getting bargains on many things Dollar tree sells. Good Luck to all that are long!!"
Does not look like a great appetite to buy the dip
"Karen Finerman on Fast money was SO WRONG yesterday with her call to ""not buy DLTR at his level as she thought there was more downside""...WRONG! DLTR will move higher from here over next few weeks...."
thanx to all those shorts for the cheap shares.. much appreciated.. the Dollar Tree Share buyback Program thanks you as well...
This should recover nicely
"You are Hilarious... Mr... ""Down About $5 At the open""... lol... You sure are trying to pump your short on this.. its the only board ur posting on... The stock has fallen about 33% from the highs... Thatz not enough of a haircut?.. most likely it will be, plus or minus a couple bucks, imo... ur scare tactics wont amount to much in the end... except to allow dltr to buy back shares cheaper.. I am all 4 that"
Can you believe this is still 80 dollar stock?
Anyone adding on this dip? My average is presently $99.18 and I’m considering adding but also worried that 40% of their product comes directly from China. Shipping costs are skyrocketing…
"Even DG is also going down. Don't buy this thing. The problem with the sector is SYSTEMIC. In six months, if things improve, it will be OK to buy. These stocks went up too much too fast."
shorts heavy here.. worse drop since march 2020.. DG down less than 4%.. $98 would be a recover PT..
"I'm concentrating on buying ZM. The fear was too much. ZM has come to stay, pandemic or not."
Added at $91.94
"You'll breakdown tomorrow.. somebody call nurse ratchett, its medication time 4 U.. and, I think ur straight jacket needs adjusting... u can still reach the keyboard"
95 $ by closeing time.. Load up bulls 
Dollar tre in talk for buy bbby .
"on its way back to 100 +, May fluctuate up and down but the direction is going to be mostly up"
"This thing is now oversold, earnings missed barely nothing that should have warranted this much of a fall. I just bought tons more so next week it should be up more."
"Goodluck to all DLTR longs you will lose all of your money on this one. Sure it may chop around in here for a while but the $1 store concept is dying. The only reason DLTR was successful over past years was it was a novelty niche store. Take $10 get 10 items. Now they are going to try $3 and $5 concept in a 10,000 sq ft store. Will never work. There fixed cost are exploding labor, containers, plus inland freight. And has anyone been to 1 of there stores. There understaffed the theft is tremendous because the majority of the people hired are less than to be desired.DLTR will be in the retail graveyard along the rest that wants to compete with Walmart Target.Goodluck all Longs with holding this one. The fed will begin to tighten in September get ready. Inflation is here too stay along with increased freight, taxes, labor, and insurance. There are 0 margins for DLTR now and into the future. LUV YALL"
"I would expect a 5% drop from the news, not 13%! This is definitely oversold and I bet it'll pop back up 5% at least by Friday."
"Wish kind of positioned itself as an online dollar store and clearly stated multiple times that their #1 focus will be price. I have not idea what people are expecting from it when the product prices are so low lol.When I used Wish as a dollar store alternative, it actually offered better product selection & service than my local dollar store. Remember what you see on the dollar store receipts? ""All sales are final, no return""...But for once when I needed a refund on Wish I actually got it.If $DLTR can be profitable, so is $Wish."
"I have enjoyed the concept, and was pleased when a mini DLTR store came to our town. On the investment side, we all prefer both getting, and giving positive thoughts, but as a chart person, the charts say wait or sell. For several months, I have noticed that the shelves in the 3 DLTR stores that I trade with have had empty shelves. At first glance, it might be a sort of supply issue; but this has lasted months, and seems to be trending worse, rather than toward improvement. Yesterday, the sole check out clerk mentioned that she is staying, because she knows, or is friends with, the management. That implies that the longer term problem can be perceived by employees. With that, I expect lower earnings to be reported soon. As an option swing trader, I am pondering a bear call spread program for DLTR. At the same time, I hope that fortune will improve for them"
bottom fish lets go! and I actually like this stock....gl all
Largest drop since March 2020.. add here on overreaction
I view this as a buying opportunity
Ouch
"Inflation, labor, and material prices are all relative here... They're still going to be the cheapest retailer. It's not like their competition has their costs magically fixed. Cost of all retailers have risen. Unless I'm missing something here? Perfect buy in my eyes. Dollar tree/general do great in recessions, and we're due for a correction."
Dollartree the stores and the stocks are helpful to my life. Its already back to $100 and I am glad I picked up some shares when I did. Its like rinse and repeat and buying at around now almost guarantees profit when this climbs back to the averages. Go dolla !
"Seriously? why drop 2%? no news at all, no downgrade and other retails are doing fine!?!?!?!"
"Dollar Tree Dollar Tree (DLTR) is the second worst performer in the first half of 2021, falling roughly 8%. The company struggled more than rival Dollar General (DG) during the pandemic, as it carries more discretionary and seasonal items. Even as consumers began to favor those categories, the stock has still struggled. Dollar Tree stock took a hit in late May, after the company offered disappointing guidance and warned of the impact of increased freight costs."
"If this sets a new 52wk low, I'm getting in."
"My view is DLTR is at fair value given market multiples, it is a solid company facing headwinds so in my view worth holding. DLTR has been conservative on guidance and expect the stock will be higher after next quarter's earnings given current market valuations."
"Ok, maybe a B+, good call again"
"Funny how some call this a, ""poor man's store."" I know a lot of rich people who go here too. I have an antique store. I go in here and buy things for a buck and sell them for 10 bucks. I just put a tag on them. It is there option to do. So if the rich do not want to go in the stores; they can pay me the 900 percent finders fee."
"Good company, on sale. Bought in at $80."
Happy ThanksgivingThis DLTR turkey got beat up this week however history repeats itself .Within the next two weeks it should return to near normal . Remember we are in the buying season and this turkey has a place in the marketplace. Cheers !
This down 12% and DG down 4%.. what BS
"I am long and 10% down in this stock, but the 5 year stock chart looks great entry point."
Little dip early today and then we correct. 95 EOD
Holding nicely.... will go up ?
"My 2 cents: Gilgamesh has been right on and I will probably buy puts sometime Monday morning - I have never sold short and do not have access to the info Gilgamesh is referring to. To make the Bull argument, we did see some buying in the last 30 mins (under 90) and it was a standoff with the shorts. DG has not gone down nearly as much as DLTR. Both likely face supply chain headwinds and pressure on margins but likely can raise prices. Monday could be exciting but will be constructive if we end in the green. Short sellers are everywhere these days but the market keeps going up."
You have been right on so far Gilgamesh. I would be surprised if we break 88 but I have been on the wrong side of this so I am probably wrong.
"Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded by research analysts at Credit Suisse Group to a “buy” rating in a research report issued on Thursday, August 30th. The brokerage currently has a $96.00 price target on the stock. Credit Suisse Group’s price objective indicates a potential upside of 16.73% from the stock’s current price.Very nice. At least 1 analyst has it right!"
What a coincidence Mr George e wright has made a name for himself
Showing some green.. Let's get to 100
they just announced the phase one deal does that mean that Dollar Tree will have to increase their earnings since it looks like there will be no more tariffs and they had factored increasing tariffs into their earnings for this final 4th quarter if that's the case the signing of the deal between us and China should provide a huge upside for Dollar Tree
Getting to be VERY oversold......still a great company and the stores in my area are ALWAYS packed. Let's let the wall street folks sell it off then go long. Good price point to get in on. Company isn't going under anytime soon....come on people.....
"I hope you are chock full of put options Gilga.... as the price of this levels out over time.. the risk will be lowered, along with the volatility... which will significantly degrade the option premiums... leaving you underwater... better close out those positions.. you missed the move, it was yesterday... lmao"
When is this a buy homies?
beat big time... will see you at $107 today
Looking at the chart. DLTR usually does a v-shaped bounce. Lets see if history repeats. Jump to 107
"Anyone who still shows a Dollar has value gets my Dollar.Re entered DLTR. Will get assigned more if it closes below $92 Friday.Simple business model - Search for bargains in basic needs, offer to customers with Walmart prices and Target ambience, without the hassle of navigating 2000-car parking lots.Happy to hold forever and sell weekly OTM calls. Will book profit on spikes."
"This company is selling products with cheap prices less than what any online business can offer like amazon. Business model is unique and Company is profitable and expanding with major transformation. Only negative headwind is freight cost and supply chain issues which expected to resolve during next few months. I believe this is worst conditions the company is facing and they learned a lot from it and they're working around it which will be in favour of the company in future, unexpected to report worse than previous report, we're at the bottom or close and rebound will be close to 97 soon. Valuation from banks between 95 and 120 so please buy cheap and sell high. If you are holding please sit tight."
Man this market is just plan criminal what these F rug pulls out of no where.. this should be $96-98 today
Why is it down guys?
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
hello 85! what happened?
"Love all the Debbie Downers, value will always be in style. And well this may slip further it is going to bob up like a cork. Give it 6 months and will be back to 100 plus."
Warren Buffett should and may buy this stock . It is one of this favorite easy to understand business with high Return on Equity and continuously generate free cash flow. There are still lots of room to grow.
"On Monday and Tuesday the margin sales continue, because the wallop of yesterday did not abate today. Then the institutional holders will begin culling their holdings for de-risking/risk mitigation. They usually do that at market prices. We will see a dive of -$6 from a confluence of these and other weak hand factors."
I don't know about you but this selloff of $DLTR today is just more cheap stock for me. Yes I read the reports of them withdrawing earnings guidance but we all know this company is going to be a staple shop for the millions of our newly minted unemployed.
"The results were not that bad, the company has little debt and inflation will drive more people to discount stores. Time to buy."
"Dangerously undervalued from any standpoint, very good entry point for any timeline investors"
Looks like its slowly climbing back up
"DLTR is in trouble. Added costs can’t be passed on. They now sell a little box of cereal ( I mean little!), for $1, they would have to sell the tiny restaurant size box for $1. Size shrinkage happening a lot in food dept., customers are not stupid."
100.75 - Bought some to start position today. I like the store and shop there at times. 1000 new stores sounds good. lets see where this one goes. Luck to all.
"I'm like Cassandra. The more accurate my predictions, the more thumbs down I get. It's my lot, and I accept it. But beware, because this stock is headed towards $80 in the short run. That's true."
I am all in; DLTR should be going up from here.
"See my response to ""D"" below, where I told you earlier in the day that this dead cat will bounce above $92 and then begin to slide. It didn't take long to happen. It might do another such bounce, but ultimately it will end the day in red, possibly $88+."
Great time to enter!
Excellent closing. Dead cat bounce snuffed out.
Maybe shorts are playing the stock
china deal is imminent and dltr will be huge rise ......so kept my dltr stock waiting to have massive profit
"When the CEO or CFO of a company tells you aahead of time to run, run as far as there is land. Some of you keep on hoping for some magic. There are strong head winds, and you were told that they will kill the next quarter. What more do you need to be told?"
I thought this would have recovered a lot note today. DG has lol
"This is a recession proof stock, but we are not in a recession."
Set your limit to buy @ 82 75 and relax Set it and forget it
"Third time in a row that this company has dropped over 10% on quarterly numbers. Low single digit top line growth, double digit profit growth, purchased company not fixed yet and debt moving down. Analysts have moved consensus up into the numbers in each of the quarters so that the company would miss the numbers while still doing well. Since this has dropped so much company should gain almost all of the day loss over the quarter until next quarter numbers are released, this is turning into a traders game. The question is at what point will there be a permanent floor it the company continues 15% quarterly profit growth wit continued debt reduction?"
Good luck all longs in your trading. What a great day in trading going to 0. This is a failed business model with current mkt conditions.
Inflation is going to hit Americans hard this fall and winter. More and more people will be buying from Dollar Tree stores. The stores near me in MA are always fully stocked and lots of customers.
"The balloon here will burst, and we will be in a comfortable RED. Just watch out how soon it will happen. There's no basis fro this to be green today."
Dollartree is going to shoot back up in price... if not for stores like this I dont know how many could afford to buy things during these rough pandemic times. I expect a positive earnings and the price boosted back to mid 100s very soon. Those who are holding will be glad they did not panic out for a loss. This chain of store is a goldmine ..holding long and strong diamond hands !!!!
This stock has shown some resistance on its way down. I decided yesterday that no one went bankrupt by taking profit too early. Enough said.
"DO THE MATH.... DG ( eps TTM= $10.88 X 18,50 PE = $202.00 stock price )...DLTR ( eps TTM = $6.21 X 18.50 PE = $115.00 stock price) STOCK CLOSED AT $98.88....Just because the company guidance was at $6.00 ???? If you use $6.00 X DG s 18.50 PE, stock should be @$111.00. SEEMS UNDERVALUED AT THIS POINT. UNLESS IM MISSING SOMETHING !"
I didn't own any shares before earnings. I bought 1000 shares Friday when my $80 bid was filled. I'm feeling very good.
Back to the $85.00's
"This stock will easily climb back over $90 a share within 2 weeks time. It is a growing company with lots of potential and no signs of trouble. Sure - Everyone wants super high growth but when your this big, it isnt as easy to support massive growth numbers. $90 in two weeks -"
Just brought in more at 80.11 to average down.
