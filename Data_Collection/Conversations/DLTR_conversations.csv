Looked at DLTR for a long time. Finally started a position a month ago at 90 when it was well off it's highs. Gotta say that worked out. Presume I won't get a chance to average down now. High quality problem.
"Dollar Tree - Will Partner With Relex Solutions To Improve Demand Forecasting, Replenishment Processes Across Dollar Tree And Family Dollar BannersOct 19 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Inc:"
Out of nowhere the company ups the share buyback count and everyone does the number crunching to figure where the stock should trade AFTER all the shares are retired. Well see how long the stock holds 100. I sold out and bought a 100 put....
"They have already diminished quantity, especially batteries, to the point I go in there less than 1/2 the times I used to. Breaking the buck will eventually make them the same as so many other ""dollar stores"". This niche was always one day going to run out of steam."
"On the Rite Aid Conversations Board, some are saying Dollar General or Dollar Tree (DLTR) are considering to buy Rite Aid (RAD). Tis rumor make sense since there are 2500 RAD stores are the right size for DLTR products plus RAD has Liquor Section and Pharmacy business including Elixir (a subsidiary Medicare Peart D Insurance company). Rite Aid has a market cap of $780 million only 1 / 30 of DLTR's market cap. DLTR can gain control of 2,500 RAD stores substituting their products with profitable DLTR merchandise and make them profitable PLUS liquor and pharmacy sections are already profitable. Elixir could spin off for about 4 billion to pay off Rite Aid debts!"
"Its funny to read the naysayers posts.. lol.. Are they detached from reality? Do they have a clue?.. This marks a major turning point for Dollar Tree. The timing by mgmt was a stroke of genius. We are heading into the busiest period for retail. Consumers are flush with cash as well.. Dollar tree stores have plenty of the essentials to sell. This will be a huge Quarter for them, imo. Institutions know that. they will be buying"
"I'm finally out of DLTR at $87.11, and it's been a momentous ride from $95. The puts especially have been unbelieveable. I'm go long at $87.09 (1000 shares only). I've bought 20 contracts of October 15 $90 calls that are dirt-cheap for $1.25, and I believe that's a real discount. Now, I'm BULLISH."

What happened to all the supply chain issues now.
"The novelty niche of buying things for $1 is gone. The value will be gone in 6 months. This is the best that DLTR will ever be. All niche retail has a life span. Where is Ben Franklin gone. Dollar Tree will be in the grave yard in next 5 years. Over a $1 will not work in 10,000 sq ft stores. Goodluck with competing with Walmart. The labor issue is terrible has anyone seen what there hiring at the local Dollar Tree it is just scary to go in there. The loss prevention team needs a loss prevention team. Im going to short maybe in the morning and ride Dollar Tree all the way to 0. Goodluck all with your trading especially longs here you will need it."
That was so cool to walk in that store knowing that no matter what i looked at was under a buck. Now it’s like dollar general. I think it’s a bummer to have to look at every price tag now. That is what made them special.
Wow China lockdown 4ml people. That is the final nail in the coffin for the supply chain. Goodluck all in your trading.
Forget about what Wall Street applauding DLTR policy of selling above price point $1. This is a hope and a prayer turnaround. For these reasons.1.There stores are to small to do this. Walmart in these small towns will crush them.2. All fixed cost are increasing every month and there is nothing that can be done.3. Freight on china imports that is another set of issues4. You will see $85 oil by end of year. Regressive tax on low end consumer.5. Labor force is less than to be desired the theft will put DLTR out of business. Working with smaller staff per stores there employees will justify there theft and nothing can be done about this it is just a sign of the times e the man owes me that is the philosophy of these low end low skilled workers. 6.DLTR is a model going to 0In closing good luck all longs I wish you know losses and lets look in 5yrs at this post and compare who was right.
will dltr change there mind on pricing if costs keep rising
DLTR about launch.. target 104.50
"Too much competition at this price level items. Sorry, just can’t see these guys making it thru. Seems they are just going into a bigger hole with borrowed fund repurchase share. Repurchase share only works well for companies actually making money."
"The stores I have gone to within a 25 mile range from my home, are all stocked up.. they have a bit lower labor head count, but it seems to be working out thru increased productivity and a lack of labor turnover.. which is good.. I stop in to dltr stores near wherever I am.. some I have seen, had some low numbered items on shelves, within the last 2 mos, but in each case, there were rolling carts full of stock boxes in the process of being put out.. this is a long term winner, imo... in spite of that AH Icahn"
"Closing my short position at $87.11 was gutsy, and my new long position and calls are making me giddy. I posted the three trades last week, and as the stock went further down, I blamed myself for not waiting a bit longer. Now, all I blame myself for is not adding more of the calls, as they went down to almost nothing. Bravo to those who went long."
Thank you Hogs. I just covered my 500 shares from yesterday's short (DLTR) @ $95.05 for a profit of $2500. Remember Greed kills and Hogs get slaughtered!!

Business is failing so let’s repurchase shares. Great move.
"What you can logically sell for $1, considering the overhead? This is the kind of ""millennial"" investment that lacks any logic."
"I find it amazing the reaction to this Dltr news... It almost has me questioning my sanity.. almost, but not quite... Its like alot of the people seeing this just dont get it.. this is great news for dltr.. the increase and also item expansion will drop right to the bottom line.. They are the only game in town.. they have zero competition at their level.. zero.. they have pricing power.. they have customer loyalty.. for the best reason, they cant go anywhere else and get the same product for the same price.. dltr is expert at it. I shop there often.. greeting cards.. 2 for $1, or $1.. some hallmark with $2,$3 & $4 prices on back.. gift bags, frozen food, cleaning supplies.. consumer staples.. food, snacks, cooking trays.. why go somewhere else and waste money?.. why buy junk at 5below, why go to Dollar General where the price is always well above $1... just go to Walmart instead.. we'll see if I am wrong, but I love dltr and think this is a huge plus for the co and the stock.. I dont see anyone complaining about DG and their prices, or 5below and the trash they sell.. for way more than $1.."
"I wonder how the national hiring event went on the 20th of this month as advertised. Were they able to hire substantial and desperately needed help ? If so, did they need to pay the $15.00 to $21.00 an hour as being offered by Walmart and Amazon ??… Has anyone heard anything ??￼￼Any input would be of significant value and helpful trading information. !!!Thanks !"
"It’s only a million shares the company is buying, not sure it justifies the move up but the crash on the last earnings wasn’t justified at all either so as always market makers playing their games"
Only hope for dollar store at this point is to be bought out by $5 below. i am seeing many of those stores pop up
I’m standing in front of a DT right now. It’s the second store that I have visited in Denver where the store was closed during usual business hours. Apparently they can’t get anyone to work here. It’s too bad. Every 30 seconds someone walks up to the door and walks away disappointed.
Time to enter long... target 113
"It is already a proven profitable company, and with the product price range expansion, they will experience better margins and further profits.Current logistics concerns, also contributing to higher price point items having better margins.Their stores are already super popular, and with expanded merchandise they will take some market share away from other places...."
"I have not seen 1 store in that state for quite some time. The store I have been to, both Fd and DT, have plenty of stock and are open for regularly scheduled hours... There was a time during the height of the pandemic when wnat you speak of was the case, but no longer. Employee productivity has also increased to bridge the gap.. It used to be there were employees sitting at the register waiting for customers, whereas now, they are stocking shelves between customers.. increased productivity.. win win.. the only empty shelves I see are those being changed from summer gardening to halloween and holiday stuff..."
Steve O.. Famous last words.. I look forward to you posting when you return to shop at Dltr
"Company increases selling price, stock drops - go figure. Great opportunity to load some more"
awesome day
"Clearly pinned to stay above 100 for the day by algos. You can tell by how flatlined the stock price has been. After hours, however, watch it fall by 3% if not more."
china locks down 4ml people wow just incredible.
up too much on news... sell over $95.. change name to $5 dollar store
Goodluck all longs your going to need it. Still going to 0
I just went to dollar tree and shelves are empty and prices going up and the chart is on a downtrend.
"fyi... there may also be a bump in Q sales due to the anticipation of higher pricing...imo... if that isnt the case, then i would think consumers will pass it off as a non event.."
My short from yesterday is now up 2k. It's been a great day in the neighborhood!!!
