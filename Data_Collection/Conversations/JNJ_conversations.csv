Great move on Jnj’s pet in regards to the lawsuits. Still giving 2 billion dollars in compensation. Not peanuts
I am a longtime JNJ investor. This stock has been acting strange lately and I can't figure it out.
"JNJ could soon have a huge growth area. The arrival of COVID saw a massive influx of stem-cell therapy trials.Quietly, 4 year ago, J&J sponsored an autologous tenocyte (tendon stem-cells) trial with little know Orthocell from Australia (OCC.AX). The results of the trial are very shortly to be released - a simple biopsy, culture of own cells, reinjection. The treatment massively amplifies the body's own natural repair and growth functions in degenerative tendons.Unbeknown to most, the company has clinically performed over 1,000 stem-cell treatments in Australia due to a local grandfather agreement with its licensing. I am one of them, being saved from a lame right arm due to a tendon injury.Over half of US emergency presentations are musculoskeletal. Figures are poor, but its safe to say near 100% of people will have a tendon inury in their lives. The rotator cuff is a complex of four tendons and studies show almost 50% of people over 60 and almost 95% of those over 80 have some form of rotator cuff tear alone, let alone the 4,000 other tendons in the body.The company has shown 87.5% success rates in patient reviews of its shoulder rotator cuff treatment with its ATI cellular therapy. This could be a massive potential out-patient market for JNJ with a uniquely simple, effective and convenient treatment.Like"
New Gender Code caused price drop
J&J is up $50 over the last 5 years. So many opportunities to buy good dips as well. Great dividend to back this position up. $160 seems overvalued but this is a great time to buy. Buy the dips !!
"In a recent online Barron's article titled ""Johnson & Johnson Stock Is Soaring Because Earnings Beat, Raised Guidance"", good news was announced about JNJ:""Johnson & Johnson (ticker: JNJ) reported sales of $23.3 billion for the third quarter, up 10.7% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings were $2.60 per share, up 18.2% from a year ago.""This news accounts for the nice pop in share price of over 3%."
"If you have 10 to 25+ years to invest, you cannot go wrong with JNJ. Just look at JNJ's track record from the 80s. It's one of the most secure stocks to own."
"Wow....just wow. Up over $1 early, now in the red. Makes you wonder how a low beta stock can be so volatile. What do the insiders know before the rest of us?"
"Rising premarket, green today, perfect moment to accumulate"
"As usual and not suprising, another good quarter. Company just can’t stop growing."
"Johnson & Johnson, while not filing for bankruptcy protection itself, may still avoid asbestos talc liabilities. This is done by spinning liabilities off to a newly created subsidiary."
Again another earnings beat for JnJ. This just shows how jnj keeps growing as a company with its diverse portfolio of healthcare products.
Any chance of a dividend increase?
"Fauci now says that sticking with original brand for booster is recommended, but mixing is OK. That conjures up many questions....as someone who can admit to not understanding the science behind mRNA, I have to stick with my intuitive sense and get the JNJ for a booster, since I already had the initial shot by JNJ."

"So Yahoo has censors too. I thought I made a mistake by hitting the wrong key to enter my comment, so I entered again....now I know it's in Yahoo limbo. Completely innocuous comment too, just looking for an explanation on which source is competent enough to trust regarding vaccines. Wonder what ""word(s)"" put the kibosh on posting it? We all know that the government is pumping PFE and Moderna....too obvious. Now I read where PFE had a ""secret"" deal with the government....who can you trust?"
The Simply Wall St valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $251.94
"Buying the dips is how you build wealth .....Those who jumped ship are regretting it now and those of us that added are smiling. Stocks will always go up and down,even this gem of a blue chip but it has always come back....Always. Bravo to those who didn't jump ship."
