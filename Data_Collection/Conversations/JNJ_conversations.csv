"Imagine going to a doctor with bad reviews, botched surgeries and lawsuits galore. That’s what taking the JNJ jab is like. Hope it works out for you."
I hold JNJ-and Pfizer - and it seemed that Pfizer stock prices have not increased after the virus vaccine was introduced.I am disappointed in the stock price movement of Pfizer. For some reason Pfizer does not increase. I also read that the vaccine under JNJ will be free but staff involved with the administration of the vaccine will be a charging for services but will be reimbursed by insurance company. I am wondering if JNJ stock will have much of an increase if they release a vaccine. I am a long time holder over many year of JNJ.

"JNJ started its Covid-19 vaccine Phase 3 on Sep 23. After a few weeks came a pause and JNJ continued on Oct 23. According to the FDA, after 2 months, volunteers should be tested for results. That's what PFE did. So, by the next few weeks, JNJ may have the results, and based on the previous phase, it will be over 97%, better than PFE and MRNA."
would be nice if we could get $200 today.... :-)
Very good news on the effectiveness of the additional Covid-19 vaccine dose from JNJ - SP should be up so no idea why this is down this morning
Step back and take in yesterday overall - great quarterly earnings with a raise for the full year. An agreement on opioid litigation that will make most of the law suits in this area go away - good news. On the flip side a story about JNJ vaccine not being as good against the Delta variant as PFE or MRNA vaccines. When you dig under this to the NYU research paper that is the source you need to realize that its not been published or peer reviewed yet and the base size of the research is 10 people vaccinated with the JNJ shot compared to 17 with the PFE or MRNA shot. These are junk base sizes for a clinical study on antibody effectiveness so conclusions are antidotal at best at these levels. You would need a base in the hundreds before drawing meaningful conclusions so I would not make any judgements on the JNJ vaccine based on this. In reality if the JNJ vaccine had poor protection against the Delta variant we would be seeing a much higher level of breakthrough infection amongst with the JNJ vaccine and we are not seeing this in the CDC data to date.
I wonder how they compensate all the dead and those who spent years in addiction. 5 billion is a just a cost of doing business expense they can deduct it so it only cost 4. I'm sure they will produce and sell opioids through the back door. Just more for other countries.
"GOD PEOPLE LIKE COVID CRUSADER AND DAVID ARE THE MOST IDIOT and #$%$ PEOPLE in the world believing that the election was stolen and that windmills cause cancer. I believe all vaccines always have rare problems that are 1 in a million but, in order to end the pandemic of covid-19 we need to get vaccinated so people don't die. Vaccines from Janssen Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-Biotech and Moderna will help end this pandemic."
"New to JNJ stock... just got in based on the results. Public is vastly underrating the effectiveness. Looking deeper it is obvious this vaccine will be the one that really dents the pandemic. The 28 day effect is very, very good and with the ease of distribution, it will take off quickly."
why won't the White House released the number of breakthrough cases there? my opinion everyone at the White House has been vaccinated. or just about everyone. it would mean they're all breakthrough cases. J&J shareholders have the right to know if it was breakthrough from the competitors vaccine contact or moderna.

"The scientists maintain that the global vaccination program is an excuse to cage mankind in a dangerous covert global transhumanism program that will end in a catastrophe for the human race.5G is supposed to be fully enabled in July-August 2021. In order to stop the whole inoculation program, they call the people who suffer from this magnetic disorder to report it to doctors and health authorities.These conclusions are supported by other scientists and graphene producers (Graphenea Inc. and Nanografi) as well as research projects like Graphene Flagship, Project BrainSTORMS , the Obama Brain Initiative and DARPA."
"the newly published vaccine results show that DNA vaccines, or at least JNJ's were evaluated at the wrong time scale. The efficacy for both the beta and delta variants increased at 8 months. I don't think the RNA vaccines can claim this."

"I love reading this from JNJ. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said on Tuesday it plans to begin imminent production of its trial COVID-19 vaccine on an “at risk” basis, as the coronavirus pandemic infects nearly 2 million people around the world.Manufacturing “at risk” allows the world’s third largest pharmaceutical company to produce a product before its ultimate design is finalized and released to the public. The company plans to produce its COVID-19 vaccine in the Netherlands, and a facility it is updating in the United States.“We're manufacturing at risk to ensure that should the clinical development and the trials be successful, we are in a position to kind of flip the switch and ready to go, to create great access across the globe,” J&J CFO Joe Wolk told Yahoo Finance in an interview.J&J began developing its vaccine for COVID-19 in early January with its European subsidiary Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. It’s using the same biological platform Janssen uses in developmental vaccines for Ebola, Zika and Influenza.During J&J’s first quarter earnings call, Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said the company is also negotiating with partners in Europe and Asia to produce the vaccine, and partnerships will be announced in the coming weeks.“Our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally,” Stoffels said.Vaccine eyes early 2021 rollout"

"Leaked NHS Data!

"The virus and vaccine both man made and planned.Could They Have Come From Our Lab?’Quay is a physician and scientist with an impressive background, including hundreds of published articles that have been cited over 10,000 times. Quay holds 87 patents across 22 different fields of medicine, has invented seven FDA-approved medicines — and believes that SARS-CoV-2 came from a laboratory in China.I recently interviewed Dr. Quay and we will post it soon. But in his research paper of 140 pages, which is more like a book, he makes a strong argument that there is virtually no chance that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is from nature. How unlikely? Imagine all the atoms in the universe and then imagine trying to find the same atom twice. That would be far more likely than the virus coming from nature.As early as December 30, 2019, there were signs. This was the day Shi Zhengli, Ph.D., the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s (WIV) Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, also known as “bat woman,” was told about a novel coronavirus that had caused an outbreak of pneumonia cases close to WIV.“Could they have come from our lab?” Shi, who had been studying bat-borne viruses since 2004, including SARS-like coronaviruses, wondered.3 Since then, evidence has continued to accumulate that COVID-19 likely emerged from a laboratory in China after having undergone some sort of manipulation to encourage infectiousness and pathology in humans, known as gain-of-function (GOF) research."

European Unioncountries have so far lagged far behind others such as Israel,Britain and the United States in rolling out vaccines.Describing Johnson & Johnson's single-dose shot as a""potential game changer"", they said it was important to engagewith vaccine producers ""to mitigate potential problems beforethey arise"".""In view of the importance attached to these issues, wewould encourage an early dialogue at the highest levels."""

Love the South Africa study results and the application for EU in India.
"Just a few thoughts spawned by reading these posts. The FDA only requires 51% efficacy to be acceptable. Many news reports have smeared efficacy results together causing quite a bit of confusion. Intended result? Your call. Some constants to live by. A 2 dose vaccine will always yield higher efficacy than a single dose. A single dose will always require the highest dose tolerable to achieve the desired result. mRNA vaccines will always require extreme cold storage. DNA vaccines are always less cold dependent. Vaccine trial results today reflect major concerns at the time the study started. Future concerns will focus on 1) how well a vaccine is against mutation variants 2) long term and possibly mucosal immunity 3) midstream manufacturing shortages, 4) portability. In short, our latest greatest data may be obsolete in just a few short days/weeks/months."

"Just read an article regarding JNJ: ""The venerable Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is so large that it has multiple domains of expertise in which its drug development pipeline has paid off over time. Between its collection of three medicines for pulmonary hypertension and its six ongoing clinical trials to expand their indications, it's no surprise that the company's disease segment earned $2.6 billion in 2019 alone. Likewise, Johnson & Johnson's portfolio of four oncology drugs brought in 8.6% more revenue in 2019 than 2018 as a result of a number of growth-oriented clinical trials. Management is also skilled at getting its drugs approved in international markets. The company operates with equal proficiency in the U.S. and the E.U., and its sales in the Asia-Pacific region remain strong, growing by 4.9% last year. When paired with its aggressive indication-expanding trials, J&J's international expertise is a key component of its growth engine. It also helps the company to hedge against economic downside risk, as its geographical segments are unlikely to be contracting at the same rate at the same time."""

Hello JNJers…..I sold this about 6 months ago as I didn’t like the litigation risk so hold no position….I am curious why you don’t buy Pfizer PFE….the forward PE/PEG is literally a third of JNJ…..the Pfizer vaccine alone will be larger in revenue than all of JNJ. I think Pfizer is they buy of the century (or at least since Apple in 2015)……I am curious to hear whether you are long both or have reason to pay so much more for JNJ?? Appreciate any thoughts.

"I think the investing audience is under valuing the JNJ vaccine results - stuck on the 66% world or 72% efficacy numbers compared to the headline 95% for the 2 dose options after both shots - and not looking at this in a complete sense. The JNJ vaccine is 72% effective at illness prevention with one shot - compared to ~50% for the first dose of the 2 shot options. JNJ reaches 100% effectiveness at hospitalization and death prevention after 28 days - compared to 45 days and requiring the 2nd shot for the 2 dose vaccines. Combine this with the fact that the one shot vaccine is easier to distribute, only requiring basic refrigeration and the fact that many people will not get the 2nd shot of the 2 dose options at all or in the right time period then the JNJ vaccine is arguably a superior vaccine option to control COVID more quickly and more completely than the 2 dose options."

$VXRT PR team did the right thing by not releasing P1 results this week- as too much noise from $NVAX and $JNJ releasing their results. Next week the spotlight is for Vaxart alone 
Nothing but bad news for JNJ these days
"Re today's Xarelto settlement:“Even in the face of meritless allegations, and even while winning in court, complex litigation demands an enormous amount of time and resources,” the pharmaceutical division of Johnson & Johnson explained in a statement regarding the settlement.“Because of this litigation, our talented scientists and researchers, our employees and many doctors across the country have had to spend numerous hours answering questions from plaintiff lawyers, compiling documents those lawyers have asked for, and otherwise being pulled away from their passion for patient care. As a healthcare company, we want to spend every moment we can improving lives and finding new cures.”"
JNJ is a bum stock. The only people that get excited by this are hack dividend investors.
"""The revised fact sheet for Johnson & Johnson’s shot states that recipients should immediately seek medical attention if they develop any of the following symptoms: weakness or tingling sensations, especially in the legs or arms, that worsens and spreads to other parts of the body; difficulty walking; difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing; double vision or inability to move eyes; or difficulty with bladder control or bowel function."" There you go. If you have any of these, go to your doctor. Problem solved."
"Hey Gorski, the ambulance chasing lawyer’s don’t care if you are Woke. They just want money."
This stock will tank when the truth about covid vaccine comes out. Money and Lobbying works but it is too hard when you can see the results.
"What amazes me is that two weeks ago JNJ as well as an independent study found that their covid jab did not require or warrant a booster shot. Now the government gave Pfizer FDA approval and all of the sudden, JNJ recommends a booster shot. I can see JNJ having an annual shot as their covid vaccine is more like a traditional flu shot and not the mNRA garbage. Did the government strong arm JNJ?"
WARNING!!!It has been proved that holding Johnson and Johnson long term will definitely effect your wealth positively.
Is it true that JNJ took a position in ATAI??? Mushrooms to the rescue..
Could this see a bump to 180 this week with the good news regarding the booster
Good old faithful stock w nice dividend
more great days ahead....thanks AG.
JNJ is a good investment....if you like investing in poison.

"For Bob.First two paragraphs from a Bloomberg story published 7/2/21 headlined ""J&J Vaccine Recipients Seek mRNA Booster Without CDC's Blessing""""Some people who received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 shot in the U.S. are seeking out added doses of a messenger-RNA vaccine, fearing their initial inoculation won't protect them from the virus.Demand for the one-and-done J&J short HAS SUFFERED (my emphasis) in part due to the perception that it's inferior to the two-dose mRNA vaccines that showed higher efficacy in clinical trials. But it is unclear if mixing vaccines will safely increase protection, and there are fresh signs that J&J's shot is a strong shield against variants."""
Are there any studies showing how effective the J&J vac is against the Delta variant. Does anyone know of any statistics? Thanks

Guessing the dips today are a result of shorts selling before weeks end?
JNJ barely 13% and market over 36% last 52 weeks and people acting like this is rockstar investor. Only a hack dividend investor likes such return.
JNJ is up 4% for the year. Everything else in my portfolio is up 10-14% for the year.Just had surgery and sure enough got an Rx for an opioid (didn’t need it) but many do. JNJ gave in to extortion on opioids.
"What am I missing? If a booster is needed with PFE and MRNA's current 2 shot doses for a total of 3 shots, doesn't it make sense and a better, less costly and logistical option for the FDA to approve JNJ who requires only 1 shot and a booster? It would immediately protect a lot more people worldwide than having them wait months to get a second shot, then wait additional months to get a booster for the same outcome. Something doesn't seem right."

"I am really pleased with JVA's progression. I am glad JVA continued bringing in positive net income. It is what mainly matters for a company like JVA, the revenue is a fixable problem. I am also glad JVA is further cutting costs by purchasing the land for JVA's manufacturing facility and consolidating manufacturing operations. The land will also strengthen the company's balance sheet by adding an asset that will grow in value over time. JVA is being run very smartly by the current generation of the family that has always ran it, the company is being ran with care like any other family-operated business (remember $JNJ is a family run company.)JVA is one of the most reliable stocks in the stock market right now, and I will be putting big profits in it for an easy triple, possibly much more if its CBD coffee beverages take off. Imagine $SBUX or any one of the large coffee chains choosing to offer its CBD coffee in its franchises, JVA will go over $100 over night!"

"The following says it all. More negative than you expect but that's reality of JNJ.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has certainly had easier times in terms of appeasing the market. The time-tested stalwart of many portfolios has had a bit of stagnation, and higher costs due in large part to legal costs related to lawsuits over its talc powder. The company also spent roughly $400 million in settlements related to Xarelto, a blood thinner. The problems created a quarter with decreases in earnings, but the company also had flat revenues.JNJ reported sales of $20.02 billion. Compared to 2018's $20.01 billion, it marks a 0.1% increase year over year. That's not exactly robust growth. On those sales, net earnings declined 14.2% to $3.75 billion. On a diluted basis, that breaks down to $1.39 per share. Compared to 2018's $1.60 per share, that's a 13.1% decline. On an adjusted basis, JNJ reported earnings of $5.66 billion, which represents a 0.5% increase year over year. That income represents adjusted earnings of $2.10 per diluted share, a 1.9% increase over last year's $2.06 per share.Johnson & Johnson doesn't give GAAP financial guidance due to too much uncertainty. On an adjusted basis it expects diluted earnings per share to increase 4.3#$%$ to $8.53-$8.63. It's relatively unchanged from the guidance provided in January. Analyst estimates seem to put full-year earnings in that range with $8.58 per share. If the company hits those levels, the stock is currently trading at roughly 16.22x forward earnings. That's not a bad valuation as long as the legal battles don't intensify.I do have concerns about how long lawsuits may last stemming from the problems surrounding baby talc powder. Overall, I think I view JNJ as a ""hold"" at present."

We were so excited about those data for a lot of reasons. I believe that it suggested this drug is doing what we wanted to do. In fact, doing a bit faster than we expected. And so we are going with those data and probably some additional data to the fda to talk about changing endpoints and changing size and maybe changing the duration of the study. Until we have those discussions, it’s probably not appropriate for us to speculate on the specifics of what those changes could be. I don’t want to get out in front of this conversation. We’ve had a very good collaborative relationship with the fda as it relates to this program, we expect this to continue to be collaborative, and I just don’t want to jeopardize that.

Janssen Announces U.S. FDA Accelerated Approval for SIRTURO (bedaquiline) as Part of Combination Therapy to Treat Adolescents with Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant TuberculosisTITUSVILLE, NJ, August 9, 2019 — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for SIRTURO (bedaquiline) tablets as part of combination therapy in pediatric patients – those over the age of 12 and younger than 18 and weighing at least 66 pounds (30 kilograms) – with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided. Approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway based on time to sputum culture conversion, bedaquiline can now be used as part of combination therapy for eligible MDR-TB patients aged 12 years and over in the U.S. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials."

"Excellent results from a phase 1/2a JNJ COVID-19.Johnson & Johnson Posts Interim Results from Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of its Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine CandidateInterim analysis from Phase 1/2a First-in-Human trial supports further clinical development of investigational vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735 (also known as Ad26.COV2.S)Interim analysis from the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate (JNJ-78436735) was posted today on the pre-print server medRxiv.The data demonstrate that a single dose of JNJ-78436735 induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in nearly all participants aged 18 years and older and was generally well-tolerated. Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.The ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial is designed to study the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and as single and two-dose schedules. The interim analysis showed that a single dose induced a robust immune response and was generally well-tolerated. These data are consistent with preclinical studies, published in the scientific journal Nature, which showed that a single dose of the vaccine successfully prevented subsequent infection and provided complete protection in the lungs of nonhuman primates.Based on these findings, the single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate of 5x1010 virus particles (vp) has been selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial. The Company also plans on running a Phase 3 clinical trial of a two-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 versus placebo later this year.The full set of results will be published once the complete Phase 1/2a trial data are available.Immune Response DataSeroconversion (the development of detectable antibodies) was observed in 99 percent of participants aged 18-55 years of age. 98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.Immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response) data from participants aged 65 years of age and above were available for the first 15 participants at the time of this post, with strong humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in all elderly participants who received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.Safety and Tolerability DataInterim safety data from the Phase 1/2a trial indicated that the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate (grade 1 and grade 2) in severity and generally occurred on the day of vaccination with symptoms generally resolving that day, or the following day. Two serious adverse events were reported, the first for hypotension which the investigator determined to not be vaccine related, and the second was a participant with a fever who was hospitalized due to suspicion of having COVID-19 but recovered within 12 hours. No grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events, solicited or unsolicited, were reported in any cohort, and no participant discontinued the study due to an adverse event. The analysis showed there was a trend toward higher reactogenicity with the higher vaccine dose and with younger age.In clinical studies investigating vaccines, it is well known that vaccines often induce local and systemic side-effects that are mild, to moderate, and transient without consequences. In vaccine clinical trials these type of side effects are actively sought (""solicited""). The interim safety data in this Phase 1/2a study is blinded to ensure participants and trial investigators are not made aware which participants received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate versus a placebo.Study DesignThis Phase 1/2a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate at two dose levels, administered intramuscularly as single-dose or two-dose schedules, eight weeks apart, in healthy adults 18-55 and greater than 65 years of age. The study is ongoing at multiple clinical sites in Belgium and the United States."

"J&J is one step ahead of others in regard to variants.Johnson & Johnson's phase 3 clinical trial unfolded as the troubling strains gathered force. That allowed the company to measure how its investigational vaccine performed versus these strains in a real-world setting. The result? The candidate showed 66% efficacy in Latin America (where the Brazilian strain is common) and 57% efficacy in South Africa (home of the South African strain). The vaccine demonstrated 72% efficacy in the U.S., where cases of the U.K. strain are still on the rise."

Too late to bother we will wait for smoke to clear
"At first glance, the results reported Friday from the long-awaited trial of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine might have seemed disappointing. Its overall efficacy — the ability to prevent moderate and severe disease — was reported at 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin American countries and 57% in South Africa.Those figures appear far below the high bar set by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the first two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, which reported overall efficacy from 94% to 95%.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and now the lead medical adviser to President Joe Biden on the coronavirus pandemic, acknowledged the striking difference at a briefing Friday.“If you woke up and you say, ‘Well, go to the door on the left and you get 94 or 95%, go to the door on the right and you get 72%,’ which door do you want to go to?” he asked.But Fauci said that the more crucial measure was the ability to prevent severe disease, which translates to keeping people out of the hospital and preventing deaths. And that result, for Johnson & Johnson, was 85% in all of the countries where it was tested, including South Africa, where a rapidly spreading variant of the virus had shown some ability to elude vaccines.More important than preventing “some aches and a sore throat,” Fauci said, is to fend off severe disease, especially in people with underlying conditions and in older adults, who are more likely to become seriously ill and to die from COVID-19.“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress in human suffering and death in this epidemic that we’re seeing, particularly now,” Fauci said, “as we well know, over the last several weeks, our health care system has been stressed by the number of people that require hospitalization, as well as intensive care.”Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, compared the ability to prevent severe disease to the effects of flu shots, which do not always prevent influenza entirely but can make it less severe.“The same thing seems to be applying here, in a circumstance where this variant is clearly making it a little tougher to get the most vigorous response that you would want to have,” Collins said. “But still, for severe disease, it’s looking really good.”The Moderna vaccine also showed high efficacy, 100%, against severe disease. The Pfizer-BioNTech one appeared to as well, but the overall number of severe cases in the study was too small to be sure.But researchers warn that trying to compare effectiveness between new studies and earlier ones may be misleading, because the virus is evolving quickly and to some extent the trials have studied different pathogens.“You have to recognize that Pfizer and Moderna had an advantage,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said. “They did their clinical trials before the variant strains became very apparent. Johnson & Johnson was testing its vaccine not only against the standard strain but they had the variants.”The best way to stop the spread of mutants and to prevent more new ones from emerging is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, Fauci and other researchers say. Viruses cannot mutate unless they are replicating, and they cannot replicate unless they can get into cells. Keeping them out by immunizing people can shut down the process.In addition to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines already in use in the United States, three more may soon become available: those made by Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has already been authorized in Britain and other countries.Globally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected to play an important role, especially in low and middle-income countries, because it works after just one shot, is relatively inexpensive, and is easier to store and distribute than the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna because it does not share their stringent requirements for freezing and refrigerating."
JNJ is good for investors who manage their portfolio stably.Just buy and hold a long longlong time.
JNJ reached settlement with New York State. $230B fine. This stock is going to tank Monday.
Too large a company and now it is crumbling under its own weight. It is happening again and again.What does it indicate? Should be restructured into three separate companies - and gain speed for growth.
All time high 174.59 !
"I suggested restructuring few days ago. Those who gave me ""dislikes"" should get it now."
JNJ and ABT have strong pipelines from internal innovation and smart acquisitions.
"The CDC reported that COVID was the third-leading cause of death in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, with Hispanics and Blacks seeing the steepest declines in life expectancy.However, as ZeroHedge noted, “Life expectancy in the U.S. has been declining for years, thanks largely to the surge in drug overdoses and other drug- and alcohol-related deaths, along with rising rates of deadly heart disease in middle-aged Americans.”"
Rough year to date for JNJ.. almost wish they didn’t have a vax out just distracts from the value of the core business
"Yea, we got inflation! So what? 10 years ago jnj price was less than half today. The dividend has doubled since. So you see inflation is manageable by the individual if you're in a financial vehicle that can keep! When this scenario changes then we could have some difficult times."

A new study from a lab at NYU Tuesday raises serious questions about the effectiveness of J&J’s single-dose vaccine against the highly contagious delta variant
"JNJ has developed a very good and important vaccine for COVID-19. The ongoing research to the one-shot (~72% effective in USA) is the optional booster shot---speculation is that will bring the effectiveness to about 90% . Also one can take Moderna routine later if one wishes, Normal refrigeration, easy distribution and fully effective in 14 days, preventing severe illness and hospitalization. This increases the worldwide supply dramatically.Remember that, ""the perfect is the enemy of the good""."

Has the opioid issue with JNJ been resolved? I haven’t followed this stock for a while.
"JNJ recall on SunscreenAs I recall, Mr Gorsky noted that he ""centralized"" supply chain after the McNeil consent decree to prevent QA mishaps like Tylenol QA issues. So now we have Benzine in Sunscreen. Here come the trial lawyers...and every rogue cancer claim. So much for that strategy, maybe time to take another look."

"Pfizer confirms their vaccine's efficacy declines and you need a 3rd shot, while JNJ shows vaccine protection is even increased at 8 months. So one's a 3 dose, the other is a 1-dose vaccine now."
No gorsky is stepping down I thought as him as a good ceo.
"When the pandemic response is driven by $$$$: then we will always be in a perpetual booster shot cycle. Time to wake up, read, research, and say no!"
"J&J might go down (A Little) soon if it keeps goin up because of profit taking, but that's natural no biggie."
About 8 away from 52 week high plus nice divy
Looks like buying yesterday was a good thing.
"Will the latest settlement really be the end of it ?I sure hope so, but my gut tells me otherwise."
