JNJ REPORTS____>>>3rd Qtr Earnings-$6.2 BILLION>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>3rd Qtr Revenue-$ 23.31.BILLION
$180 this week???
Hello JNJers…..I sold this about 6 months ago as I didn’t like the litigation risk so hold no position….I am curious why you don’t buy Pfizer PFE….the forward PE/PEG is literally a third of JNJ…..the Pfizer vaccine alone will be larger in revenue than all of JNJ. I think Pfizer is they buy of the century (or at least since Apple in 2015)……I am curious to hear whether you are long both or have reason to pay so much more for JNJ?? Appreciate any thoughts.
"Looking for JNJ-3989 to go into phase 3, that will get this stock moving in a positive direction."
180 by the end of the month ? And 200 ? By the end of the year ???

Alex Gorsky stepping away after leaving JNJ in great shape....but still there as exec chairman. That's good news! Very long term hold.
"I drove by Talcville, VT, ""a populated place located within the Town of Rochester"", yesterday. From the Rochester Historical Society referring to pre 1929:""Records show that 6 – 7 car loads of talc left its Lower Rochester (today still called Talcville) mill to find its way around the world. And 45 – 50 cars of Christmas trees originated on the line in season.""""cars"" refer to train cars. There is no context in the above statement; not sure if daily or what but surely not a one off. My question is: How many workers or residents of Talcville were stricken with cancer?Obviously the last sentence quoted above is not related to the subject at hand, but I thought it was fun to read."
Are there any studies showing how effective the J&J vac is against the Delta variant. Does anyone know of any statistics? Thanks
"Great studies from South Africa, 71 percent efficacy and 96.2 percent prevents death. Great vaccine and company 24 billion in q2 of revenue and average of about 80 billion a year !"
I believe jnj covid vaccine might not get as many people taking it compared to Pfizer’s shot in the US but jnj definitely has growing room is Africa were many people live in rural areas. People would definitely take the jnj shot because that’s the only shot that is 1 dose and it does not need to stay in below zero temperatures.

More news from former CDC director....no new evidence to support the Covid virus was a product of nature. Mounting evidence suggests it was man-made in a laboratory. Redfield said he was “sidelined” and “threatened” for taking the lab leak theory seriously when the pandemic began.
"What am I missing? If a booster is needed with PFE and MRNA's current 2 shot doses for a total of 3 shots, doesn't it make sense and a better, less costly and logistical option for the FDA to approve JNJ who requires only 1 shot and a booster? It would immediately protect a lot more people worldwide than having them wait months to get a second shot, then wait additional months to get a booster for the same outcome. Something doesn't seem right."
US judge declined to stop JNJ from splitting talc liabilities from main business.Reuters reported yesterday.
Buy JNJ and ABT dips is Phi Beta Kappa move

"Smiling ear-to-ear today, fellow JNJ investors.....how about you?"
At least Gorsky left J&J at a really incredible position with a market cap of 470 billion and he still will be the chief executive of the board of directors. Great fromer CEO.
"All time high! Great pipeline of pharma, healthcare products and medical devices."
WSJ is reporting that Alex Gorsky is stepping aside Jan 3. Joaquin Duato to become CEO
"I wonder how difficult the decision for the FDA will be for full approval, considering all of the Adverse Events reported? Just listening to ABC news....FDA is close to authorizing booster shots...within 48 hrs. for immuno-compromised. Who will inform those who need them?"

"Today--JNJ->>>Ex Div. date-Aug 23rd, 2021.Forward annual div. yield=2.42%-All enlisted men & women in Armed Services may be required to take JNJ vaccine....Bullish"
Buy on the dips....That's how you build wealth.
Great solid company thru the years w nice dividend
Very good news on the effectiveness of the additional Covid-19 vaccine dose from JNJ - SP should be up so no idea why this is down this morning
200 by the end of this year with all of jnj growth in revenue!!!
Does anyone know if JNJ vaccine is being used for under 18 years of age. Do they have any clinical trials ongoing for data to support?
Again I must point out Jabby is awful silent as JNJ keeps climbing setting new highs....We longs love both.
"What amazes me is that two weeks ago JNJ as well as an independent study found that their covid jab did not require or warrant a booster shot. Now the government gave Pfizer FDA approval and all of the sudden, JNJ recommends a booster shot. I can see JNJ having an annual shot as their covid vaccine is more like a traditional flu shot and not the mNRA garbage. Did the government strong arm JNJ?"
Great company w nice divy
"Adding to my JNJ and ABT positions. People are getting older, living longer, and will be spend more on healthcare."
When do you think jnj will announce data on booster shoots ???
Half the performance of a boring market ETF or fund over the last 52 weeks; what a hack dividend stock.
"I just saw a picture of Joaquin Duato, his suit was off the rack the tie was $25-$30 dollars he is most definitely a blue chip commander and chief I believe he'll do JNJ well as CEO."
"JNJ->>>Ex Div. date-Aug 23rd, 2021.Forward annual div. yield=2.42%-All enlisted men & women in Armed Services may be required to take JNJ vaccine....Bullish"
No gorsky is stepping down I thought as him as a good ceo.
"This way Gorsky can stay on top in spite of required retirement from the Exec Committee for 62+. Gorsky will turn 62 at next birthday. That rule does not affect Board of Directors. This was a way to get around the rule! Which is an antiquated rule, anyway. 62 is pretty young these days."
"Great performance of J&J, but I’m worried about the high P/E multiple. At some point, multiples have to get back to normal again (15-17?). With the Fed announcing deceleration of QE, the world could become normal again sooner than expected. Question: is this a good time to sell and cash?"
