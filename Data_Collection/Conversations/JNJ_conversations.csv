"The reason I believe Johnson & Johnson is a great stock jabewonky is because J&J has a lot of market share in medical devices, pharma and healthcare products like Listerine and band aids products Even if the Economy is down people will still need these products period. JnJ might not grow as much as other stocks but we know it will probably do well in the long term."
Buy JNJ here is a phi beta kappa move.
the company is well I want to know more about its
Love the South Africa study results and the application for EU in India.
“My Body My Choice”…What about the Vaccine Jen and J&J?
Waiting for $157
Very good news on the effectiveness of the additional Covid-19 vaccine dose from JNJ - SP should be up so no idea why this is down this morning
"Smiling ear-to-ear today, fellow JNJ investors.....how about you?"
"Great studies from South Africa, 71 percent efficacy and 96.2 percent prevents death. Great vaccine and company 24 billion in q2 of revenue and average of about 80 billion a year !"
Waiting for $156

God big pharma has been doing horrible recently not just jnj
"8/15/21-The Street Quant Ratings (JNJ):We rate JNJ a BUY- This is based on convergence of Positive investment measures, which should help this stock OUTPERFORM the majority of stocks we rate.HIGHLIGHTS JNJ's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the subsector average of 20.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 27.1%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. ## The gross profit margin for JOHNSON & JOHNSON is currently very high, coming in at 75.43%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. ## Along with this, the net profit margin of 26.93% is above that of the subsector average.Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 53.93% to $5,314.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the subsector average cash flow growth rate of 9.38%."
Does anyone know if JNJ vaccine is being used for under 18 years of age. Do they have any clinical trials ongoing for data to support?
"I wonder how difficult the decision for the FDA will be for full approval, considering all of the Adverse Events reported? Just listening to ABC news....FDA is close to authorizing booster shots...within 48 hrs. for immuno-compromised. Who will inform those who need them?"
JNJ is canceling conventions due to covid. They do not trust anything. Even the vaccine.
For the record jabber wonky no one is going to take your advice on stocks period. Most people believe jnj is a great company ok.
"forward PE 16, this company is clearly undervalued"
JNJ REPORTS____>>>3rd Qtr Earnings-$6.2 BILLION>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>3rd Qtr Revenue-$ 23.31.BILLION
"BREAKING—CDC study confirms the NIH-Moderna COVID19 vaccine is more effective against DeltaVariant hospitalizations than $PFE/$BNTX or $JNJ. Vaccine efficacy for Delta—Moderna 95%, Pfizer 80%, J&J 60%. VE also higher in age <74."
KINGPIN of OPIATES stepping aside ............... Hooked on OXY?
At least Gorsky left J&J at a really incredible position with a market cap of 470 billion and he still will be the chief executive of the board of directors. Great fromer CEO.
"There are recalls against major drugs sometimes, what if this needs to be recalled later. Its only been around a year. I know in your minds this is full proof. But how brainwashed can you possibly be"
Looks like a buying day
Jabber wonky = big head but small  or that is just me ? All time high today and great company !
I am a longtime JNJ investor. This stock has been acting strange lately and I can't figure it out.
"Anybody know how the manufacturing output of JNJ's vaccine is going? Seems like a no-brainer, one shot, high protection level from hospitalization and death, and very little storage and handling concerns. World gone mad....understand that some people are not able to take vaccines, but 25% simply refusing to take them?"
I found why JNJ is dropping like a rock ! >> read and sell !EU finds J&J COVID shot possibly linked to another rare clotting conditionBY Reuters— 7:45 AM ET 10/01/2021
"JNJ market cap 465 billion, shares outstanding 2.67 billion, employees 134500, share price 176,25$"
oversold and really cheap now
"Why did Carefree delete its ""had you bought JNJ five years ago"" post?Very odd. Presumably I embarrassed it."
Has anyone read the U.S. VAERS data from DEC 14th 2020 to September 2021? Why is JNJ taking a pounding when the stats speak for themselves?
buy/add now or regret in few days/weeks
just sold all J&J shares after speaking with an employee who told me they are requiring vaccination for all employees by Oct 1st. They are going to loose many great people and have law suits for years to come. Horrible business decision
Again I must point out Jabby is awful silent as JNJ keeps climbing setting new highs....We longs love both.
"JNJ is a ""watch the birdie"" type of company. While some are distracted by speculative media articles, the company consistently produces results, as validated by reporting season. I'm a holder of many shares, very happy with my solid and relatively safe growth from an outstanding and AAA rated behemoth."
FDA approved JnJ vaccine finally.!
"$24BILLION DOLLA BLACK CLOUD - Faced with more than 34,000 ovarian cancer lawsuits, many consolidated in New Jersey federal court, J&J has told attorneys for the victims that the company is actively exploring options to transfer its potential talc-related liabilities – valued at approximately $24 billion – to a stand-alone subsidiary and seek bankruptcy protection for that business entity. Such a move would limit compensation for victims to pennies on the dollar and could bring an indefinite halt to all related trials scheduled in state courts across the nation, as well as the federal multidistrict litigation being heard in Trenton."
200 day MA is broken today! Welcome to $150 !!!!
Will this stock split before years end?
"Lack of trading, discipline is the primary reason for trade losses, it is estimated that nearly 80-85% of intraday traders end up lossing money in the stock market experiencing loss is also part of the game but that doesn't mean you should blow your trading account."
"That one month graph looks fantastic, lol."
I believe jnj covid vaccine might not get as many people taking it compared to Pfizer’s shot in the US but jnj definitely has growing room is Africa were many people live in rural areas. People would definitely take the jnj shot because that’s the only shot that is 1 dose and it does not need to stay in below zero temperatures.
No gorsky is stepping down I thought as him as a good ceo.
Correction: YTD negative returns. (ex dividends)
Why is JNJ going down?
Are JNJ’s legal issues causing this stock to slide lowered and lower?Making an OK dividend but dead money invested in share price.
"I know we sell vaccine here, but cdc seems to ignore the immunity of recovered Covid patients. John Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic’s research say recovered people are as immune as fully vaccinated, possibly more so. There are close to 100 million recovered. Add that to the vaccinated. Are we approaching herd immunity?"
Bottom is in folks ! Charts show stock basing here at 200 day MA and the buy signals are in! Looks for a run up to $180 as way oversold conditions create a buying frenzy.
$170 this week
DefinitelyLook into ABCL... key player that’s has been working with mRNA AND AI antibody tech even before covid.. now partnering with modern and eli LillyAmong others... read the recent news.... seriously
"Hello people,Do you think JNJ is worth buying at this price point and also with the inflationary pressures? Is it well poised to pass those increases to costumers etc? With the crazy stock market and future outlook, I wonder if this is a better stock to buy now."
"So for all the longs, if JNJ is such a reliable blue chip stick why does it fall weekly with no end in site?"
"Those who are more hip re pop culture knew this already, but I just heard that a few months ago (recently Covid infected) Chris Rock referred to the JNJ vaccine--the one he received--as ""That’s the food stamps of vaccines”"
I am buying more for my retirement and dividend and steady growth...yes!
"Anyone else get the feeling that media and CDC are ""promoting"" mRNAs?"
great news on the Baby Powder scam. J&J is just going to file chapter 11 and drag it through the courts for the next 25 years.
"Breaking News on WSJ: ""Long-covid concerns help fuel Biden Administration's board booster push."" $MRNA $BNTX $JNJ"
"Wow, my sell limit order at $160 just executed. Sorry guys I am out temporarily as JNJ is in a free fall. Didn't want to sell but neither anyone on this board nor management comes out with a statement why JNJ is down 12% and headed towards 20% decline which means it will be in a bear market."
"Adding to my JNJ and ABT positions. People are getting older, living longer, and will be spend more on healthcare."
Buy JNJ and ABT dips is Phi Beta Kappa move
Do you think Jansen should go into mRNA or J&J buys a mRNA company ?
Does anyone think that vaccination acceptance would be higher if Ebola were the virus du jour?
YOU CAN GET RICH WITH THIS ONE STOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"JNJ is still only -8.3% off its 52 week high. The stock is doing fine.Keep in mind that JNJ's 52 week low was just over $133. So if the market pulls back, then we could realistically expect to see 150 again."
Johnson and johnson or Pfizer stock?!
US judge declined to stop JNJ from splitting talc liabilities from main business.Reuters reported yesterday.
And the 20% correction hasn't even started yet...
"I’m an investor truly believe in the science. EUA soon.Zyesami will be also approved in a nebulizer formulation.

Making new all time highs. Heading towards 200.
DOW is up 300 and JNJ still down ?
stop it shorty don't burn yourself
180 by the end of the month ? And 200 ? By the end of the year ???

"Same price it was at the end of January, hack dividend stock."
"Hahaha, look at it fold. Got worse as the day went on, even larger decline coming Monday."
Cramer on CNBC said this morning its time to BUY JNJ as its oversold. This means its time to get OUT! Cramer is the worse stock prognosticator
Are there any studies showing how effective the J&J vac is against the Delta variant. Does anyone know of any statistics? Thanks
"OK, I'm getting conspiratorial again.....gonna share a debate question directed at Biden from about 4 yrs. ago. Trump asked Biden....""what's the matter Joe, don't you trust Johnson & Johnson""(possibly paraphrasing)? That debate ""aside"" question was naturally never answered by Biden, but it has stuck in my craw ever since that debate. #$%$ did he mean by that, does he have insider insight, does he see what the deep state has in mind for the socialization of businesses? Remember, this company has been under litigious attack for years now. A successful AAA credit rated company constantly in the news, not for the positives they brought to society, but all the negative trash(without proof) that ambulance chasing lawyers can fabricate while propagated by the media. Sounds like a socialistic takeover happening in our country, while the great lie of ""fairness' is perpetuated."
JnJ booster is 97% effective. Wow
"Nice, very nice."
More news from former CDC director....no new evidence to support the Covid virus was a product of nature. Mounting evidence suggests it was man-made in a laboratory. Redfield said he was “sidelined” and “threatened” for taking the lab leak theory seriously when the pandemic began.
"If you have recovered from Covid and have a positive antibodies test, why is necessary to have the vaccine?"
JNJ - downgrade - holdI am downgrading JNJ from buy to hold.This estimate is based on safety concerns of the JNJ COVID-19 vaccine.There are reports which are indicating that the JNJ genetherapy is not effective against COVID-19 and leads to severe COVID-19.Do youe own due dilligence.
Significant stock price decline recently. J&J’s decision to force employees to take the vaccine or lose their job is going to backfire on them! Thousands of their employees are seeking legal council and considering leaving this Woke Liberal Horrible company.
For the past decade JNJ has been a good buy when the forward PE dips below 15. Almost there…
Adverse effects are not being reported and tracked in hospitals. Healthy people are getting myocarditis and congestive heart failure from this vaccine. Hospital staff members are afraid to speak up for fear of losing their jobs. J&J is a horrible horrible company who will suffer major consequences in the future for their criminal actions.
"this stock is a stable complement for many porfolios, just buy the dip and accumulate. Not expensive anymore at forward PE of 15.21"
"Anyone know if JNJ makes money on the vaccines they distribute outside of US? Article I read a while ago stated that the company would deliver vaccine at cost in the US until pandemic is over....don't know how they determine being ""over"" when variants keep popping up."
$180 this week???
fallin knife????
"any reason for this drop? the company is doing well, this is a core stock for many portfolios, and price is not high"
REUTERS REPORTS.Update 2.Drug companies say enough U.S.states join $26 bln opioid settlement to proceed.

Is JNJ headed for bankrupt? It’s selling off like it’s going out of business? I thought JNJ was a solid blue chip with minimal downside….guess I was wrong
"I drove by Talcville, VT, ""a populated place located within the Town of Rochester"", yesterday. From the Rochester Historical Society referring to pre 1929:""Records show that 6 – 7 car loads of talc left its Lower Rochester (today still called Talcville) mill to find its way around the world. And 45 – 50 cars of Christmas trees originated on the line in season.""""cars"" refer to train cars. There is no context in the above statement; not sure if daily or what but surely not a one off. My question is: How many workers or residents of Talcville were stricken with cancer?Obviously the last sentence quoted above is not related to the subject at hand, but I thought it was fun to read."

Any price below one sixty is a gift and a sure thing!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why because it is truth
"Everyone mind should be pushing themselves towards lifting their financial statusthrough investing in a legit platform whichyou be earning more profit, if interested ininvesting."
"Great performance of J&J, but I’m worried about the high P/E multiple. At some point, multiples have to get back to normal again (15-17?). With the Fed announcing deceleration of QE, the world could become normal again sooner than expected. Question: is this a good time to sell and cash?"
"What am I missing? If a booster is needed with PFE and MRNA's current 2 shot doses for a total of 3 shots, doesn't it make sense and a better, less costly and logistical option for the FDA to approve JNJ who requires only 1 shot and a booster? It would immediately protect a lot more people worldwide than having them wait months to get a second shot, then wait additional months to get a booster for the same outcome. Something doesn't seem right."
JNJ has a face only a hack dividend investor would love...
When do you think jnj will announce data on booster shoots ???
"come MOnday, I will love you!"
I’m thinking if I should buy now or wait until after earnings.

"What amazes me is that two weeks ago JNJ as well as an independent study found that their covid jab did not require or warrant a booster shot. Now the government gave Pfizer FDA approval and all of the sudden, JNJ recommends a booster shot. I can see JNJ having an annual shot as their covid vaccine is more like a traditional flu shot and not the mNRA garbage. Did the government strong arm JNJ?"
225 in timr
WSJ is reporting that Alex Gorsky is stepping aside Jan 3. Joaquin Duato to become CEO
We should be up a lot more then just a $1 today lol
Why are healthcare stocks getting crushed over the last month?
Buy the dip!
How have I not made a dime since owning this stock in February. The moment I make a little I’m selling
I shot vaccine plus good solid company w nice divy
JNJ vaccine is a joke. Can't believe people got the one shot at 67 percent coverage. Caused problems. Bio Tech better.
"This way Gorsky can stay on top in spite of required retirement from the Exec Committee for 62+. Gorsky will turn 62 at next birthday. That rule does not affect Board of Directors. This was a way to get around the rule! Which is an antiquated rule, anyway. 62 is pretty young these days."
As others have said this is a huge buying opportunity. 3 weeks ago the price was $179 and nothing really has changed since then so why now down to $165? This will rebound in the coming weeks back to $180+
jnj has shed 35 B of MC in the past 3 weeks or so. That more than covers the legal issue. How much more for the fact their vaccine is the worstamong the many

Is it possible that you can statistically predict compliance to advocated worldwide vaccination protocols? Did the CDC have an idea of just how many people would adamantly reject the vaccination for Covid-19? Pressure is now being applied...no more Mr. nice guy tactics.
Steady gainer w nice divy
"I received the JNJ shot. As a customer I hope no booster is needed, but as a share holder I do."
Sorry but we're not at the 200 dma. it's at 162.97 when you account for dividends.
"All time high! Great pipeline of pharma, healthcare products and medical devices."
"Although nothing in the works, sure would like to see a split. Been in this stock since 1995, had a couple splits over that time frame. I think the last one was in the 1990's some time. I guess it doesnt matter all that much. I've done well with this stock. Helped me buy a house. With dividends and drips, my average price is about $22/share."
All time high !
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"JNJ->>>Ex Div. date-Aug 23rd, 2021.Forward annual div. yield=2.42%-All enlisted men & women in Armed Services may be required to take JNJ vaccine...."
Great solid company thru the years w nice dividend
I’m buying
"When the pandemic response is driven by $$$$: then we will always be in a perpetual booster shot cycle. Time to wake up, read, research, and say no!"
BUY BUY BUY
"All eyes on ACRX on 09/22/21 at 2:00 pm EDTJNJ great news today on the 2nd COVID shot! Albeit, $PFE still the only FDA approved VACCINE drug... $MRNA next up for FDA approval..."
Getting oversold now
An experimental vaccine which they are requiring all employees to receive. Why did they void themselves from any potential future liabilities if they were 100% confident that it was safe?
"JNJ->>>Ex Div. date-Aug 23rd, 2021.Forward annual div. yield=2.42%-All enlisted men & women in Armed Services may be required to take JNJ vaccine....Bullish"
JNJ is at 200 day MA now! Needs to base here or its headed to $150 quickly.
"soon 600 mo too. Delta variant is so fast and not easily suppressed. We, not only need more care, more sanitation products oxygen cylinders and respiratory products etc but more VACCİNATİON!!. Hey if it is not that bad Pentagon would not order vaccination for all soldiers in active duty. Delta is coming in full force and we need more vaccination no matter what....Buckle up flying to 600 imo.$PFE $BNTX $BMY $LLY $MRK $JNJ"
How obvious can NIH be in their promotion of Pfizer and Moderna? Something smells rotten in government agencies.

"jnj is a good stock I will buy if it goes down bit lower. bare in mind the Dems want to pass legislation to reduce drug stocks, look at, lily, abbv, biib, Amgen to name just a few. they like stocks with debt and negative earnings per share, go figure!"
Half the performance of a boring market ETF or fund over the last 52 weeks; what a hack dividend stock.
"when daily volume hit 13M plus, it was the bottom for the move...at least for a while. bounce was $5-$10 over next few weeks."
"So $158 is the support, resistance @ $164?"
"Entered a 25% position in the low 160s and will add on further weakness. Have always wanted to buy JNJ for my dividend growth portfolio but was put off by the low yield even though this Dividend King raises the payout at least five percent annually. So why is the yield stuck in the mid 2s? Because the share price keeps rising. Great stable, total return investment."
would be nice if we could get $200 today.... :-)
200 by the end of this year with all of jnj growth in revenue!!!
JNJ is a huge buy at $160 or under
"Data on vaccine much better than anticipated by media.....will there even be a need for a booster? Stay tuned for more supposition from media....stay informed with REAL news from CDC and FDA. Appears to me that media and government are ""pushing"" the Pfizer and Moderna shots, and suppressing the JNJ news. Or maybe I'm just biased?"
Cheap entering here for long hold
oh never let this go. So good. Wow. Amazing .
"One of the LEAST trusted companies in the world. Politics, Money, Greed is their new credo."
JNJ linked to blot clots according to EU…how bad will the stock be hit on Monday???
So now the 1-dose J&J Covid vaccine looks to becoming the same as Moderns & Pfizer..... a 2 dose vaccine.
"price and 200sma and 200ema(support??) sitting between $159-$162.Wouldn,t be shocked in it makes a stop at that destination soon. Amazon just performed that miracle. Those who bought were rewarded."
"Sellers here will regret it. Decent div, excellent management, a fortress of a balance sheet."
PAYDAY TODAY!Another great day for JNJ shareholders with the next big day in December.
$JNJ is at its 200 day it has to bounce from here. $BIIB Huge news today. Not yet seen by many
"Is there a reason why Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines wane enough to recommend a booster? Do they have reasonable evidence that may suggest efficacy ""drops off the cliff"" at some point? Is that predictable....again, why are the politicians and media pushing the boosters?"

"$150 coming soon, have your cash ready!"
This is the LAST TIME you will see $BIIB this low. Did you see that $48 million BUY yesterday? We could close WELL above $305 today. Yesterday I said ALL savy biotech traders of stocks like $NOVN $PROG $VXRT $BIVI $EVFM $GBS $CLSN $PTGX $ANVS $SAVA $AUTL $NNVC $ENZN $DRNA $PULM $KMPH $APTX $EOLS $RNLX $VKTX $ORPH $APTO $GLTO $HTBX $FMTX $EQ $VRTX $SYN $CAPA $KLDO $TARS $INZY $FLGT $CVAC $XFOR $ACRS $SANA $JNJ $MRK $MRNA $REGN $LLY etc should be loading $BIIB with both hands. I hope they listened. The trend is BULLISH again. If u can't tell. NEW ANALYST Neddham initiated a BUY coverage Yesterday with a target price of $400! $400 is kinda low to me but at least it's better than where $BIIB is now! Free money  imo.
Please please can we get some good news this week.
No dividend why bother
"Forget about the other pipeline but delta alone is gonna push sp higher mo. Unfortunately too many unvaccinated and this delta variant is so fast and not easily suppressed. We, not only need more care, more sanitation products oxygen cylinders and respiratory products etc but more VACCİNATİON!!.

Deborah the paid pumper…get a real job
"Merck's turn to make money....another dormant stock comes to life. We're seeing a lot of that lately....begs the question of who is in control of market? I can't help but wonder how many of our political representatives were ""in on"" the news before hand and bought?"
"In all, more than 500,000 have died from overdoses to prescription and illegal street opioids since 1999, according to federal data."
"The talc and opioid law suits are having an impact.Until they resolve these issues, the stock is going down.They pay billions of dollars in legal fees each quarter with poor results. Settle ,take a hit in earnings, and move on."
94% protection in the us. 74% worldwide. Why ?Is the AY 4 variant breaking thru in South Africa and the UK ?
Why is JNJ down????Why????
Hello JNJers…..I sold this about 6 months ago as I didn’t like the litigation risk so hold no position….I am curious why you don’t buy Pfizer PFE….the forward PE/PEG is literally a third of JNJ…..the Pfizer vaccine alone will be larger in revenue than all of JNJ. I think Pfizer is they buy of the century (or at least since Apple in 2015)……I am curious to hear whether you are long both or have reason to pay so much more for JNJ?? Appreciate any thoughts.

“Buy the dip.”-Buffett.
I am sorry but I feel like this company is underrated it owns so much market share in the healthcare industry. Great dividend and stable company.
"Pfizer and Moderna, have already made their money....read this in a business article this morning. The numbers in sales(PFE~32B, Moderna~7B). Just can't wrap my head around these figures....was this a bailout for hospitals and corporations under the veil of a pandemic?"
J&J forcing all employees to get the experimental vaccine but unwilling to accept any further liabilities for adverse effects. Horrible company!
"forward PE 15.77, c'mon this gem of company is way undervalued. I will add to my position"
dividend thank you.
"So last year's ""spread"" was about $46 low to high. So far this year's ""spread"" is from a closing high of $179.48 to a low of $153.07. Does this mean that we are ~$20 away from a new low for the year? I'm in no way a ""player"" in the stock market, and to my perception, someone is manipulating for monetary benefit. IF someone were ""in the know"" as to when these spreads occur or are actually causing this variance of value throughout the year, they're making big money off of that knowledge, no? How is the beta factor calculated....is it misleading?"

Great move on Jnj’s pet in regards to the lawsuits. Still giving 2 billion dollars in compensation. Not peanuts
Many people are seeking for stability in an unstable crypto space and a lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now I'll say it's
Great company.
"$BIIB is trading at the price it was at BEFORE FDA APPROVAL, actually not 1 FDA approval but TWO! They just had an FDA approval last week? All big biotech traders from $ABBV $AMGN $REGN $LLY $JNJ $PFE $MRNA $MRK will be loading this dip with both hands. Do you guys even know HOW MANY NOVELTY drugs are under Biogens belt or in the pipeline? THE bears are AGGRESSIVELY using the fact that ""only"" 100 patients have received the drug so far as a reason for it to trade at the price level which acts as the drug never existed.! As if the drug is not THE ONLY DRUG APPROVED for Alzheimer's. At this price it's FREE MONEY, it's a layup. Why is it BOUNCING HARD from $285? I'll let you think about it. Oh and let's not forget about the ""little"" partnership with $AAPL.that both $AAPL & $BIIB are keeping on the hush. $BIIB HAS HAD AT LEAST 4 MAJOR accomplishments since its FDA approval of Aduhelm that have ALL been overlooked. It's trading at a price BEFORE ANY of these accomplishments. You're crazy for missing it here."
Alex Gorsky stepping away after leaving JNJ in great shape....but still there as exec chairman. That's good news! Very long term hold.
Lol I can’t believe people short j&j
Looks like a buying opportunity for JNJ.
I am buying as it goes down...keeper for 10 years or more
"Now we need to know about every politician and their family members that purchased this stock over the past 14 days. Remember, they work for us!!!"
Thank you for the buying opportunity is all I can say. This is a solid blue chip with rare opportunities to buy low. Thanks !
"Invested in J&J a couples years back and have closely followed the pharmaceutical industry. Found a company by the name of SpectrumX which has an IPO set for November. SpectrumX are leaders in patented shielded HOCL formulations that have numerous applications in medical/pharma fields. They have also undergone 2 clinical trails for Covid-19 treatment (apparently not factored into the company valuation.) To me this company seems to be on track for high growth after the IPO, however I may be getting lost in the hype. Would love to hear people's thoughts on the stock as I am keen to invest early."

Will the gov't be paying for the vaccines administered via blow dart?
JNJ is non sale. Just bought another 500 shares at $158.05. Your portfolio will thank you in a year. Nothing fundamentally wrong with this AAA rated blue chip stock.
Unfortunately this virüs will stay with us at least 6 mnths imo. dont get mad @shrties but u longs thx 2 shrties . They are the fuel of all Covid related stocks. becauseofem they all will fly again. MRNA to 600 imo.$PFE $BNTX $BMY $LLY $MRK $JNJ (bullish all of them)
"What’s funny is asking the board to explain the drop leaves everyone baffled. There are no answers, the only answer is from folks who state they bought JNJ 20 years ago at $50 and they don’t care. But for those who own the stock for retirement and their savings are falling….well no answers with silent management means this will continue to slide for a very long time. Could we be headed for under $100?"

Looks like no one is talking about JNJ vaccine anymore. Dead money
