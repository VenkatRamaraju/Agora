I called MAC today and Jean Wood from investor relations called me back and said I made alot of good points about them to issue press releases to alert the investment community about positives going on at the company
"Congratulation to all long who have hold. We are closing the 1st month of the year with a 50% price increase, and MAC is willing to report a positive Free cash flow on a catastrophic year for mall reit. Mall reit like MAC will take advantage of the pandemic on the long term. I would have preferred that this week rollercoaster never happened, but that’s part of the game and MAC is a volatile stock since a while.Nice weekend change your mind!"
Currently at the Mall of America. It's packed.
"Wall Street Bets (new) is back up. The announcement that they closed the forum literally caused all of the high short stocks to selloff. Every possible tactic is being used to try to control the mania. Don’t buy into it. The facts are simple- MAC is highly shorted, it’s business model is returning to health, and it’s worth more than the current price. Hang tight"
"The news today cannot be interpreted as all-good. After all, there is an equity dilution, and bulls here (including myself) thought that it wouldn't take a dilution to resolve the LOC issue. Now that it involves an asset sale and a equity issuance, let's see what's the good and the bad of it. The good news is, obviously, that the relatively high financial leverage so badly perceived by the market is now over. Moreover, the risk of a debt non-extension in July is now nullified. Basically, illiquidity in any foreseeable future is should no longer be anyone's concern (err... except fig, of course), and MAC is in a good position to embrace a recovery rally.Now we want to see what price MAC has to pay for the above. it sold a 95% stake of the Paradise Valley Mall in Arizona for (net) $95 Mil. It will take more information and further analysis to know how much of a fire sale this $95Mil represents, but it is safe to say that under the current market condition it will be at least somewhat a bargain deal for the counterparty. Having said that, Paradise Valley Mall isn't a crown jewel of MAC's portfolio: it is a declining old mall last improved 20 years ago; and it is only a 20-min ride from MAC's flagship Scottsdale Fashion Square, rendering it somewhat redundant. A redevelopment project under a JV was just approved last month, meaning that MAC probably hasn't spent much on it yet. Now it just sold its stake to its JV partner.MAC issued 36 million shares at $13.54 to raise USD 487Mil. There are two implications. First, the higher number of shares will lower any profitability measure (such as EPS, FFO/share), regardless of the issuing price. But this kind of dilution is all right, because it is just a normal risk-return trade-off (you earn less but you're less geared). Second, the issuing price relative to its true original value determines whether value is created or destroyed. If you believe that MAC's true value before the share issuance is say $12, you should be happy that it issues more shares at $13.54, because it improves the true value on a weighted average basis. Since most of us believe that MAC's true value before share issuance is way above $13.54, the issuance lowers the true value, and that is the cost we pay for the risk elimination mentioned above.But by how much? Some simple calculations based on the 149.7 million shares at the end of 2020 show the following: (the first column is the perceived true value before issuance, the second is the true value after issuance, the third is the implied discount)$15 $14.7 2% discount$20 $18.7 6% discount$25 $22.8 9% discount$30 $26.8 11% discount$35 $30.8 12% discount$40 $34.8 13% discount$45 $38.9 14% discountIt should be apparent that if you are not that bullish on MAC (say you value it at only $15 before issuance), then the impact of 2% isn't significant at all. MAC's share price can move more than that any single day. If, on the other hand, you value MAC much higher prior to issuance (say, like me, you value it at $40), then you need to substantially revise downward your valuation (by 13% in this case). It is a substantial price paid for risk elimination. But then, at the current price of $12.5, both a $40 valuation and a $34.8 valuation should both imply a strong buy."
"High Yield Landlord, a paid subscription service on Seeking Alpha has (1) recommended MAC to its subscribers and (2) recently in August, bought shares of MAC for its own portfolio. Again - encouraging signs that committed, informed buyers are buying the stock."
"Great day today, but still a long way to go before this stock is fairly valued. A dividend increase, a solid earnings report or an offer to buy the company will send it higher quick and hopefully force the short squeeze we are all hoping for."
"I've been to the Deptford Mall, Freehold Raceway Mall, Kings Plaza , all MAC malls and each time were crowded , and not many empty stores"
Why so quite these days? Mac dead meat? Lol
"Question: MAC shares outstanding keeps going up. On 2-17-2021 shares outstanding was 160M.Now as of 6-30-2021 shares outstanding is 206M. Are the shares being given to the management in lieu of cash compensation? or, are the shares being sold? If sold in the market, there should be a record of such sales.This increase in shares outstanding is causing Book Value to continue to decline."
"MAC did not hold 18.30 which negates break out of wedge formation and could not follow back up above 18.30 when broad market rallied back late in the session. This portends more down side, maybe, tomorrow."
Instead of raising of dividend. I rather prefer mac has stronger balance sheet and lower the debt. Generate a bigger income instead. So this company can at least go back to half of 2015 sp lvl.
sold other stocks and bought 10 more calls in the AMnow my whole portfolio is mac
"Funny News:1.JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut The Macerich from a ""neutral"" rating to an ""underweight"" rating and set a $12.00 price objective for the company. in a report on Monday, December 21st.2.JPMorgan Chase & Co. boosted its position in shares of The Macerich by 145.1% during the 4th quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. now owns 2,267,759 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $24,197,000 after purchasing an additional 1,342,537 shares in the last quarter"
Will keep trading sideways until earnings or any company update on collections and activity. Still is forming a strong base before the big jump. Cannot stay this low forever! I build my 10k position so now I will sit on it until it goes at the minimum to the roaring 20’s.
"I'm quite disappointed with the performance of this stock. I am in at $6.00 with 5,500 shares respectively, and there is absolutely no reason why $MAC should not be trading at $10-15 today. This stock is one of the best risk-reward investments on the market today: They have more cash on their balance sheet than what they are trading for in today's market - downside risk is minimal and the event of bankruptcy is extremely unlikely in the presence of COVID. $MAC is a perfect example of a completely misunderstood company with high upside potential - making it one of the most undervalued stocks in today's market, despite the recent market crash. In the event of their earnings being released, I was really anticipating some big movements today - very disappointing. Disclosure: I am long Macerich"
Investors Business Daily moved MAC from a 68 relative strength to 78.
#$%$ MAC is dead meat! Very disappointed!
"A couple things here:1) Yes Macerich only collected 26% of April rent as of their Q1 report date. Remember that this was during full closure of all stores. Since then, 20 stores are now fully opened, with another 15 now opened for limited curbside pickup. With openings happening, tenants will start repaying rent.2) On the earnings call, there was a lot of discussion about how Covid has proven that Class A brick and mortar is essential, and even retailers with a strong e-commerce platform are seeing that e-commerce has served as an incredibly weak bandage.3) Q1 earnings beat expectations, and there was YOY revenue growth as well as NOI growth. The sales per SF also broke the $900/SF mark which is much higher than Simon’s avg which is in the high $600s. 4) This Coronavirus has accelerated many things, one of which has been the separation of Class A malls in affluent areas vs. lesser malls. As we know, Macerich has trimmed its portfolio down over the past couple of years, resulting in a lower FFO. However, they dumped those properties when the market was still hot, and now they have probably the nicest/most high end portfolio in the mall world.5) Due to Covid, the last cycles’ move towards urbanization is now being reversed, and suburbanization (affluent millennials leaving the cities to move to rich suburbs) is taking place at an alarming rate. Macerich acts as the town center for these affluent suburbs.Lastly-and I know this was a long post, but they’re diversifying into office through lease deals with industrious, and their building a 550k SF office/retail flex campus for google, which is a company with one of the best balance sheets on planet earth.Just watch-they are executing impeccably, and I predict that within 6-8 months we’re back above $40 per share, and within 2-3 hrs this stock will hit all time highs."
"Any opinions on PEI (Pennsylvania REIT) common stock? May be another retail REIT opportunity, although with a longer time horizon, compared to Macerich. $PEI $MAC"
"We are heading back to 18's and new high. Technically, we gain 1$/month on average since vaccine news on nov 9th."
I think I'm gonna add more shares right before the new dividend is announced. Since covid cases will probably rise after christmas and new years eve. This might cause some uncertainty about lockdowns etc. Also I don't see a whole lot of positive news coming up in the coming months except the stimulus package. Am I missing something? I'd like to hear how you guys think the share price might move in the short term.
"The FINRA Feb-A report out today shows that 56% of the shorts covered in the recent rally. There are still 34.3M shares short which is 24.5% of the float, and it will be harder for those shorts to cover because there are fewer and fewer long term holders willing to sell with the great REIT reopening just getting started. Earnings will be much better later in 2021 and especially 2022 with the Google office space delivery. Definitely headed up from here, both share price and dividend."
Why is MAC down today when all its peers went up? Maybe they are selling more shares today?

having held since apr may 2020 happy to see this value play start to get recognized. hard to lose long term when you buy at discount to book value. holding for higher levels later this year
"really good press release this morning, adding more Primark leases to the MAC portfolio."
"I've been to two Macerich properties over the past month or so, Broadway Plaza (Northern California) & The Oaks (Southern California). The sample size is small, but the narrative that the mall is dead is far from true. Both were bustling with business with the restaurants packed with happy eaters. Interested to hear what people are seeing at other Class A Malls across the country. Zero interest in lower quality malls that are indeed dying."
Should be a much more upbeat earnings call with reopening and strong financial moves during the last quarter. Hoping to hear more confidence throughout and moving forward.
"if you get an urge to sell, look at the long term chart here. A giant ABC pattern. 2009 and 2020 bottom. It went up 700% from the 2009 bottom within a year. 2,000% in 6 years."

LOL pretty sure the Canada pension fund will be regret as hell when Mac recover by 2023 and reach $30-50.
"Feb 19 $30 call interest building up nicely. It tripled today.This is the cheap way, ahead of time, to amplify a coming short short squeeze prior to the GME folks bringing their megaloot ($6b today) over here to gorge on the stock."
Do you think that by the beginning of the November price will stay above 18.5 because of the high demands of shoppers around the end of the year? plus the earning announcement and divdend?
"chances this getting bankruptcy is nil...if it comes to that point ...they will sell some assets to bring down the debt levels....or also raise capital once the cap markets are open...worst possible scenario is they may be bought by bpy or spg......every ones know the quality of mac malls there are one of the best and new retailers are occupying the closed shops like lucid motors , duck sports ,Peloton will be in most of the mac malls going forward ...also Dyson..these brands are doing good even in pandemic..."
"Retail Recovery8:30 a.m. ET: Retail sales surged 5.3% in January, versus 1.1% jump expectedRetail sales rocketed higher in January following a December slide.Retail sales rose at a 5.3% monthly clip in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, following a drop of 1.0% in December. This was much faster than the 1.1% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.The jump came as sales at department stores, electronics and appliance stores, and non-store retailers reversed December declines. Department stores sales surged 23.5%, but were still down 3.0% year-over-year. Non-store retailers, a proxy for e-commerce sales, jumped 11% in January and surged by 28.7% year-over-year.Overall, retail sales were 7.4% higher than January 2020, extending a streak of year-over-year growth that began over the summer."
"I just noticed this stock and how undervalued it is. It owns the top shelf, platinum real estate near me. Glad I can load up on shares before the party starts."
"Great thesis from another board:They need to issue PR in relation to this. Clearly they aren’t diluting.. They do not need to hire a debt adviser to dilute shares to deal with debt.. My guess is they have an offer from consortium of banks, but are dealing with complex structuring of loans related to unencumbered assets and other complex instruments... and they don’t want to finalize anything until they are confident it is the best possible terms they can achieve... watch this pivot and blow up in shorts faces.. or watch paper hands kick themselves when this takes off once we get clarity.."
"september 17, there are 10000 call options from now to 20' , just saying......"
Read the Citi downgrade It’s all about the debt coming due and the inability to raise capital A bit doomsday but get the pointI guess they can do what Simon did and flip the keys back on a mortgage that’s not performing as these are non Recourse But I think we’d all feel better if they shored up the balance sheet soon
"With MAC you get the best of both worlds. There are a lot of stocks that are good value plays, and there are a handful of stocks which are currently vulnerable targets for a GME-style short squeeze, but MAC is the only one I see which gives you both. It gives you the great upside of a potential short squeeze, with the downside protection of a stable and profitable underlying business (MAC owns some of the best real estate in the world). That is why 90% of my portfolio is in this stock."
Macerich stock price target raised to $20 from $12 at Deutsche Bankhttps://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/markets/news/story.asp?docKey=1-SN20210608005568&cid=1-SN20210608005568
Investor presentation by MAC. Nice on paper. No movement in price until they show us higher profits and dividends.
"I'd like to thank Mike and the others who analyzed the stock situation when it was around $ 10. While there is a lot of spam on other yahoo boards, here Mike often updated even several times a day. Thanks to this, I learned many things and felt more confident buying these shares. I only have 800 shares, but I am a young investor from Central Europe and if I had more money I would definitely buy more MAC :)Thank you for your substantive conversations, I would like you to know that thanks to you, someone somewhere earned some moneyGo MAC! "
"MAC has 1.6 billion market cap and around 650 million of cash, their debt is non recourse all their places are open collecting rents plus they signed new significant leases going forward, the current price is relatively low a strong cash position"
Get ready for 0.50 divi. Ultimately malls will open and people will start going out. Confinement is not for humans. Online and other stuff will do well in qtr1 but qtr3 onwards there will be resurgence of people going out and spending great and fun times socially. Expect opposite of distancing once virus settles. At these level MAC great buy. The way rents will decrease or defer same way MAC obligations will be defered. Panic is the time to buy not sell. Buy.
"MAC about to drop the hammer in Q3 and Q4 of this year. P/FFO just over $7. Let's go!!! For however long they may need to continue issuing shares around $18 (which is almost 2X my basis of $11) they won't be raising the dividend. However, once they've stopped issuing shares, you can bet the dividend will be raised the next quarter or shortly thereafter. This company is going to booom."
"Big players are manipulating MAC price. eTrade changed margin maintenance requirement to 75% yesterday morning. Then, they changed it to 100% afternoon after market closed. On top of that, eTrade require margin due today which is literally require funding right away. Either eTrade is exposed to short squeeze risk from their short-sell clients or getting pressure from big players somewhere to make such change. By changing the margin requirement to 100% and immediate due on margin call, it forces selling. The rise of MAC has nothing to do with GME frenzy (except for 1 day) but being drag down by it. I had to liquidate all of my other holding in my portfolio to fulfil the margin call. BUT, I AM KEEPING MAC. Be patient, more volatility ahead of us but MAC will prevail. DO NOT SELL."
Let’s assume MAC can at least pay $2.5 annual dividend. 8% dividend rate means $31 stock price. This is the minimum stock price target
"I am a SPG investor ( bought in at $65) and going to hold a long time. Came across MAC recently and want to invest. Read the Q3 ER call.With the occupancy already at 90%+ to what it was pre-covid, 1) where is the upside? I mean it can go from 92 to 100%.. is that it?2) Why is MAC so much down for the year? Sounds ridiculous.3) Looks like the dividends are definitely safe4) Cash flow are increasing and with that they can reduce the debt. But debt seems a lot (but debt is high at SPG as well.. the only thing is SPG is expanding with Taubman acquisition)What is longs' thesis on MAC going up 100-150% from here? Obviously their assets are worth a lot and are in prime location. If they want to get rid of the non-core assets, who/why should anyone buy?Liquidity is not a problem.. ok, its a problem but a short term problem, so I like to think.Many things look promising and MAC looks severely undervalued with respect to its assets and portfolio. Can someone please make a bull case for a newbie (to this stock) to invest? Thank you!"
"If a second round of dilution takes place, and assuming that the entirety of the $500Mil capacity is used up for issuing shares at $11.5 on average, and also assuming that the number of shares was 149.7mil originally and 185.7mil after the first round of dilution, then the impact of two rounds of dilution is calculated as follows: (Perceived share price before dilutions, Implied share price after 2 rounds of dilution, Implied discount)$10 $10.8 8%premium$15 $14.1 6%discount$20 $17.4 13%discount$25 $20.6 17%discount$30 $23.9 20%discount$35 $27.2 22%discount$40 $30.4 24%discountThis is obviously a very large negative impact on the valuation of MAC shares (unless you perceive the shares to be worth less than $11.5 of course). Revising your valuation from say $40 to $30 is no small issue. On the other hand, my previous point still stand: if your original valuation is less bullish, then the dilution won't affect you much. If your original valuation is very bullish, it should affect you a lot but not at the current market price. There are two issues I don't quite understand about this potential new round of dilution. First, why did management immediately file for another round of equity issuance? Without this extra round, the news of settling the unsecured debt should undoubtedly a piece of positive news that would raise the share price. If management simply delay the filing for several days, or even just one day, they should be able to issue the second round with a much more favorable average price.Second, why would management give out an updated 2021 EPS and per-share FFO guidance on Mar 26th if they are to immediately issue more shares right afterwards, rendering these guidance for 2021 immediately meaningless? One possibility is that it is an SEC regulatory requirement in terms of the timing and the guidance. Anyone who knows better please enlighten us. A more optimistic take would be that it is an indication of MAC not going to go about a second round in the foreseeable future."
bought a lot of options today... can't wait for 30$
US opening back up to foreign travellers...this should help MAC centers which are concentrated in touristy areas
Today's action shows general market is rotating into safer investment options. Both SKT and SPG rose while MAC fell. This means investors consider MAC risky while SKT and SPG are safe for two reasons. 25% of MAC portfolio is in the far-left states where they can decide to flip at any time and start locking down again like European countries are doing right now if threat of infections increases further. Second is that MAC still has $500M worth of stock ready for sale at any time if management wants to do so which means possibility of further significant stock dilution. Management needs to resolve the second concern in the next ER by stating that stock selling is no long necessary unless emergency arises. Both of these concerns will be resolved only if another lockdown does not occur. Variants in general are more infectious but they are less deadly. But far-left authorities will over-react regardless as they always do. This is the biggest threat for MAC. Let's hope sufficient vaccination occurs in short time to achieve herd immunity before bad things happen again. We also do not need SPG stock pimp Reuben Brewer from MF. This guy put out at least 3 articles specifically targeting MAC for the last one month. It looks like he is pimping for SPG which he holds while getting paid by hedge fund shorters of MAC for writing articles bashing MAC with superficial knowledge.
"With borrowing cheap and inflation on the rise, I expect MAC will be taken private sometime soon. Think about it! I borrow money for nothing, then use it to buy a massive property owner on the cheap. I know some will say malls are dying, but not Class M malls like those owned by MAC. The property they own and the land under them will only increase in value as long as inflation continues trending upward. Only one thing stopping this in my opinion, a quick run up in share price. Say mid-high-$20's. Just my opinions."
"This is a classic short term bad news long term likely great news.How much do you factor each probability?Short term MAC has lower occupancy, lower rent collections, lower dividend and loan covenant issues.Long term, there are numerous new vaccines, for the cause of MAC's largest problems, Covid 19, The new therapeutic from Israel that appears to be a Covid cure, MAC has many of the countries best locations, numerous projects that will be on line increasing rent collections, only pays an average 3.7% on its debt, and as a REIT its rising rent collections should result in significant dividend increases.The price is a balancing act. What makes MAC more exciting than most is the large short position can double the number of buyers if the good future begins to outweigh the negative near term. Some of the buyers (shorts now) may even panic buy since their loss can be unlimited (short squeeze). All in all an interesting but risky stock to own long, as I do."
"This is the part of earnings call that concerns me and would like to hear your thoughts about. It’s clear management will issue more stock this year so the big question is if it would be enough to actually cap the price this year. Thoughts??Management was asked to explain why they already went over the $700m ATM assumed for this year from the last presentation and he basically says that was for display purposes and that they will issue this year dependent on stock price. “Caitlin, that was a generic placeholder in a three-year forecast that Scott was using to illustrate deleveraging. So that was not a hardwired assumption. We've been really fairly active on the ATM, so it's going to be dependent upon the share price, whether we use it again this year or not. It remains to be seen whether we'll do equity again in 2022.” - Management"
you can buy MAC x8 cheaper than SPG but collect a dividend 50% of SPG.
I’m buying tomorrow and holding for the big event coming next week 
Both $MAC & $SPG are almost back to pre-covic level. Now I just them to increase the divvies back to the previous payments.
Up almost 6% today despite that hit piece being published bashing MAC. Definitely a show of strength when the stock spikes in the face of negative news coverage. Perhaps that article will even have the opposite of the intended affect. Maybe it will draw attention to MAC and the smart money who actually look at the numbers will see that it is a great investment opportunity (currently listed as the #2 most undervalued company covered by Morningstar).

"MAC has nearly completed the LOC refinance and has raised more capital. Here's part of the PR:Through March 25, 2021, the Company has sold 36.0 million shares of common stock under its ""at the market"" equity program at a weighted average price of $13.54 per share, generating gross proceeds of approximately $487.3 million. As of March 25, 2021, approximately 1.0 million shares remain available to be issued under the program.The Company is under contract to sell a 95% interest in Paradise Valley Mall, a non-core asset in Phoenix, AZ, for $100 million to a newly formed joint venture. The transaction is expected to close in late March 2021, and is anticipated to generate net proceeds of approximately $95 million to the Company. The Company will retain a 5% joint venture interest in this multi-year redevelopment.The Company has obtained commitments from its joint lead lenders, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs for a new revolving line of credit and credit facility. The total capacity of the line and the credit facility is expected to be between $600 million and $800 million, with the facility expected to close in April 2021.As of March 25, 2021, the Company has cash and cash equivalents, including pro-rata share of joint ventures, of approximately $950 million. Expected total liquidity after the close of the new credit facility and the Paradise Valley sale is expected to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.85 billion prior to paying off the current line of credit."
Profit taking in recovery stocks is over. Going up again. MAC is the most undervalued stock in the whole market.

"I mean, you can't say it isn't trying hard as heck to break that resistance, that's for sure"
"PJT is also an investment bank with the connection to potential buyers. It is possible that in order to manage the debt, MAC would like to sell some of its unencumbered assets, and need to find buyers via PJT. A lot of PJT deals under ""strategic advisory"" are acquisitions related."
Still above $18/share. Up from here. $18 is the floor now
ahhh I forgot that yahoo is the better stock message board. I love MAC. Biggest value play in america.
"Hey new investor here. Whose this guy, @fig, who thinks that Mac is headed for a correction? How could an already severely undervalued mall company (in terms of FFO/sh relative to competitors) with non-recourse loans and top value assets be headed for a correction even with a market downturn?If anything, their assets would get bought up at a steep markup like TCO’s did, and that’s worst case scenario.With high rent collection and e-commerce companies renting out space, you can’t even make the retailpocalypse argument. Btw, “pumpers” is a term used for a security that is being overbought. Considering this one has 58% short interest, refer to us as contrarians."
"The one thing I don't like about today's rise in share price is that the intraday price patterns for all of the 10 most-shorted stocks among S&P 1500 (MAC is #6) are the same. That means that by and large the short covering activities are not dependent upon company specifics. The strong fundamentals of MAC relative to its valuation doesn't seem to be the main driver at all. The good thing though is that at least MAC, with its 20% gain, turns out to be the top gainer among the 10, so at a lower level its fundamentals matter. MAC's short squeeze must turn idiosyncratic (detach itself from the group) if it is to continue in the next 10 days for MAC. We won't want an exhaustion of the GME run to mean the end of MAC's run as well. And there is a way to do it.Normally I don't care about a company's dividend's policy: a dollar distributed or kept within the company means the same for me. In MAC's case, it may even be just marginally better to keep the dividend low just to be safe. But at this juncture, I think the company can trigger a real spectacular short squeeze if it strategically announces a dividend raise. It doesn't even need to be a lot. This will provide a focal point for the coordinated action of short-covering for MAC's shares and produces a squeeze, differentiating itself from the rest of the ""most-shorted"" group. Last year it wasn't until Jan 31st that MAC did the dividend announcement, and this year it looks like it will be even slightly later than that. That may be too late. But MAC can surely do it quickly if it wants to."
Will short squeezing return tomorrow? Thumbs up if you think price will rise more than 5% tomorrow. Thumbs down if you think price will drop more than 5% tomorrow.
It sounds like the line of credit issue is close to resolution. Chapter 11 or stock dilution is not on the table. The stock will fly on the news!
"The fact that we are holding above 11 right now , with both options expiration, and a potential stimulus package being passed by tomorrow is a positive IMO."

"Between a rock and a hard place. MAC wants good terms for the LOC refinance. They see their numbers increasing with the end of the pandemic. The longer they have to improve their numbers, the better deal they should get for the long term. $1.5 billion! Even a 1% savings is $15 million a year. That is almost $.10 a share more for dividends per year. The problem is the near term and some shareholders fears that they will get a bad deal, with shorts magnifying this fear by manipulating the share price at any opportunity.I suggest that for long term income investors, this gives a great chance to build our holdings in an excellent company at a fraction of its value. Always a chance for a short squeeze, but actually I think their coverage will only get us back to a reasonable price sooner than later. I'm not very optimistic of a GME squeeze. If it moved quickly to $20, I would not sell.I expect the dividend to be raised by the 3rd Q and again next year. Might have to wait a while to $3.00 a year but I see $2.00 dividend by next year."
"The downgrades just added to my confidence , I have been in many, many stocks early like this and the downgrades always come in so they can build there positions before it runs away from ""them"". Keep in mind it can take months for someone like JPM for example to take a position! Last thing that they want is for Mac to get to $20-25 before they are ready!!! Mac 23PT June 2021 be patient"
Dividend Day Tomorrow
Why did MAC go up with sudden high volume today? Something happening?
"I am 30 yrs old and prob worth about $400k (not to brag but just to put into perspective the ""size"" investor I am). I work in commercial real estate as an asset manager, and have been keeping an eye on this company for quite some time. The fundamentals didn't make sense, and it's solely because of the shorts. So, before the pandemic I invested about $30K at a $24 share price. Once the pandemic hit, obviously this drove it down even further. However, I kept buying this thing all the way down the the ground because I feel absolute conviction in this company. It is in NO way a meme company. This company was trading over the summer at $6-$8 and had a Q2 FFO of $0.55. Take some time to read the past few earnings call transcripts...this company is going to surge. They reduced dividend by $0.15 and even said ON THE EARNINGS CALLS that this allowed them to pocket an additional $400M per year for the company to just hold in case things got rough, or they were unable to refinance. Well...fast forward and rent collections are probably now north of 90% (guessing as I am a CRE asset manager and we have some malls in our portfolio). This should now bring their FFO probably back to around $0.70-$0.75. They've kept the dividend the same at $0.15 per share, and as of the last quarter there were roughly 141M shares. Do the math... $0.75 AFFO per share minus the dividend = $0.50/share ""saved"" by the company. This equates to a cash pile generation of ~$70.5M in ONE QUARTER while still paying out a ~4% dividend at these prices. They also have a huge 500K SF office retail project completely pre-leased to GOOGLE which will be up by 2022. Part of me thinks they didn't bump the dividend to purposefully not join the GME craze (in case they want to be acquired), but that's just me hypothecating because normally they've run a ""tight"" dividend moat, but right now they are only paying out about 20% of the dividend and pocketing the rest to ""sure"" things up. It's another way to obviously recycle ""free money"" to drive up share prices to meet future dividends. I have absolutely ZERO doubt that the dividend will be back to $0.75 within a year or two, and for that reason, I will 100% be keeping my 5000 shares with a basis of $11. I bought it all the way down to average by initial 30K at $24 per share, down to now about $70K with a basis of $11. I could have made a quick buck but then I remembered I am an investor and not a ""trader."" Good luck to all other longs!!!"
"I'm planning on being a long holder here when I purchased my shares this past December. I'm sure a lot of people are probably disappointed that MAC didn't hold it's gain from early last week, but MAC is up more than 30% from a month ago and it feels like we might have found the floor at about $14If we hold this price for a day or two, I would expect it to move up from there. I don't believe it will be a rapid rise, but a more gradual one as the vaccine gets distributed and we get into Spring. I'm not saying a short squeeze can't happen, but I think it's less likely now that we see what the brokerage houses will do when it sees all the retail purchases coming in against a large short position.For people who purchased at a higher point, you have a few choices. Sell for a loss and move on (not a great choice in my opinion, but each Investor has their own particular goals), hold and wait for the price to go back up (which I believe it will over the rest of 2021), or buy some additional shares and average down (I've done this strategy with two Energy stocks that took huge hits on back in March of last year and it's worked out well for me). Remember that Investing should be logical. Very few good decisions are made when you get emotional when investing. Good luck to all...."
"Last week I traveled to Phoenix and visited the MAC malls and the SKT outlet while I was there. The MAC malls are very high end and in very desirable locations. Here's something I posted on the SKT board:I visited the Phoenix outlet on Sunday evening 1/5/2020. It's located in a great area close to the AZ Cardinals stadium and it was packed. I had to park in the farthest corner of the lot. Just wanted to see how traffic looked but ended up spending about $500 on the family. Bargains were amazing and nearly impossible to resist. Not sure what margins are for the various retailers but I can say sales volume is very high, as nearly every shopper had multiple bags of stuff. F21 and a couple other ""bankrupt"" retailers were open with plenty of inventory at this location.I recently entered a position in this name and have added to near my intended max. People that think malls/outlets are dying clearly don't go to these malls. I also visited the MAC malls in the greater Phoenix area several times over the past week and they were very busy as well. The MAC Scottsdale mall is HUGE. There would probably have to be 75k+ people in the mall for it to feel packed. Parking lots in the areas I parked were near full. The Apple stores were packed although I didn't see a lot of people actually walking out with stuff."
Yesterday Morningstar reaffirmed their fair value estimate of $32.50.
"8/23/2021 Morgan Stanley 2,400,938 shares $43.82MOverall biggest institutional inflow for more than 4 years."
"Simon and now Tanger have both raised their dividend. MAC is next, and I don't think it will be a half cent like Tanger."
MAC is behaving better today. Made above 18.30 and holding and showing some strength.
Seeking alpha article is out yesterday. analyst predicts 51$/share price

"While up markedly from Covid crash lows, MAC still has plenty of room to run. One of the two largest Class A mall operators in the U.S. along with Simon Property. These are the city centers where the best retailers and restauranteurs alike want to be. Expect no less than $25 per share by EOY."
"Following earnings announcement, Morningstar reaffirms fair value estimate of $29.50, stating that the Q1 results were slightly better than they had anticipated and concluding that ""trends are all reassuring and in line with our estimate of operations slowly returning to normal."""
"1. Macerich MAC owns 47 regional shopping malls near big urban centers in the United States. As of Oct 7, all of its properties had finally reopened. Rent collections have been improving since the spring. In the third quarter rent collections were at 80%, up from 61% in the second quarter. Macerich has resumed paying a dividend. Shares popped on the vaccine news, but are still cheap with a forward P/E of just 3.8x."
"Redevelopment:While the Company reduced its 2020 development expenditures by approximately $100 million to conserve resources in light of the uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic, work progressed on selected projects. Notably: ? One Westside in Los Angeles, a 584,000 square foot creative office redevelopment, continues on schedule with a planned delivery to Google in early 2022. ? Restoration Hardware Gallery opened at The Village at Corte Madera in Corte Madera, CA. ? Comcast, #$%$s Sporting Goods (?#$%$s?) and Round One opened within the majority of the former Sears store at Deptford Mall in Deptford, NJ. ? #$%$s opened within a portion of the former Sears store at Vintage Faire Mall in Modesto, CA. ? #$%$s opened in a newly expanded footprint within a portion of the former Forever 21 store at Danbury Fair in Danbury, CT. ? Saratoga Hospital opened within the former Sears store at Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs, NY."
"16.47 50 day simple moving average, tested 20 sept and it holded. Looks like this is the bottom now, Prepere for 20$ ride"
"There is some major rotation from last year's mega cap tech stocks into value and dividend stocks. This includes all the mall REITs --- MAC, SPG, SKT, PEI, WPG, EPR, and many energy names like EPD, VLO, AR, AM, ET, and others.Add that rotation and the end of shutdowns to the huge short interest in a few of these names and you're set up for 2x to 6x gains in short order."
Even if the dividend only eventually goes back to 2 dollars where els are you going to get an annual almost 20 percent return like that ?
"For better or worse, MAC is getting pulled into the short squeeze trade along with GME, AMC and some others. Not nearly to the same degree as the others, but still. To be clear, the business behind MAC (Macerich) is in much better shape than the businesses behind GME, AMC and many of the other big short squeeze stocks. My point? Don't be in this just for the short squeeze. This is a viable economic recovery play that can be held longer term. Definitely not a pump and dump only. Good luck MAC longs!"
MAC could be next GEM. based on such high short ratio.
"According to the ""short interest ratio"" (which is the days it would take for all shorts to cover at an average volume day), MAC (15) is MUCH higher than GME (6) or BBBY (11).This means that, compared to trading float and volume, MAC would have a much bigger price surge with any successful short squeeze than the others. Furthermore, for what it is worth, MAC is a solid company with decent book value."
"At first glance MAC seems like a bad buy. Shopping malls are (supposedly) in a secular decline and MAC has a relatively high debt load. Wall Street analyst price targets , earnings estimates and the short % of float reflect this sentiment.If you dig further you find that the best contrarian investment authors all love this stock. The best part is that they all have very rational, simple arguments as to why this stock is setting up for amazing gains over the coming months and years. A class Malls will survive and thrive and the debt load of MAC is manageable. All MAC really has to do is return to normal valuations (estimates varying from 30 to 60 usd per share). This stock will only be driven more by the impending short squeeze. This is the best stock to own in the market right now."
"Company is coming out of this Strong, just like they came out of 2008 great financial crisis. Just look at the chart during the GFC and how the company came out of it, history is going to repeat itself. Below is a couple of comments from the CC. GLTAL""Cash flow is improving by the month as we move into the third quarter and I expect that to continue.""""And although, there's still many uncertainties, we can I think clearly say that the third and fourth quarter will be much better than the second quarter of 2020."""
Seems like the longs are starting to get some legs under this thing. Didn't fall a ton as market declined.
"The Investment Group - Ashkenazy Acquisitions which has over 12B in AUM, recently bought a 6.8% stake in MAC. This further confirms the thesis of investors that are bullish on MAC."
"It's true!!!!! I have googled ""nasdaq GME real time trades"".So many of the trades are 100 shares of GME each time, retail investors dont have such money to trade 100x230 each trade lmao. it's so madenning how this could be allowed, even a retail investor like me could see through this fraud. Please spread this message around, ao that people could witness this with their own eyes!!!!!$GME $AMC $BB $NAKD $NOK $EXPR"
"$18 Teflon floor holds today. Next stop, $20"
"I know MAC has tons of debts, but I also want to see my divvies go up. Anyone knows when they gonna increase the divvies?"
I could have bought other stocks that have easily doubled by now but I find it much more rewarding making money from this historic short squeeze happening right before us. GO MAC GO!!!
Great day but we were here in July. We need to close above $19 and then I think we run a little.I figure last Q may have been a little better than expected. If so one could expect leaks to continue and the price to run a bit.
MAC Rocked It Today.
"Waiting to see what the MAC brain trust says on Thursday. Keep in mind the top 5 get $10 million in salaries and declined a $90 share buyout from SPG.Oh! we are doing are best but due to covid we can't raise dividend, buy back stock or increase cash flow.What do you want for our million dollar salaries."
"Simon offered them $92/share and MAC has even been upgrading their portfolio since then. This is how people like Warren and other Value icons Invest--they analyze the difference between the price and underlying Value. What do you think their assets in Scottsdale, CA., MD., etc., are actually worth in this real estate market? Mall lots are becoming full of upscale housing, fitness centers, Starbucks.... GLTA."
"$2000 stimulus imminent with new senate. April everyone will have access to vaccine, summer is 5 months out. Think about the pyschology here, people are going to have so much pent up demand to go back to malls and socialize. This will be $20 by June."
Someone keeps on dumping MAC whenever it goes up which is why it keeps on sliding. Could it be MAC management?
"I bought MSC at $7.75, I'm doing good with it"
"SPG broke out and finally reached pre-pandemic price and SKT exceeded it but MAC is struggling to hang on to even 18. With massive stock dilution going on, this is not unexpected but it looks like it's not going any where until there is some good news such as dividend increase or something."
"I made this comment as a speculation when they first announced the share dilution, but now I am more certain with the latest AGM proposal --- it is a quasi-poison pill designed by management to keep their jobs at the expense of billions worth of shareholder value. They know that Simon has always wanted the company. They know that their managerial missteps make a good reason for their dismissal. They know that MAC's mall assets are the best in the industry and the shares are worth multiple times the current price. If Simon offers >$30/share, shareholders will immediately say yes, Simon will land a bargain deal, and management will be fired. So this den of thieves issued shares to dilute, in the name of improving leverage. To enhance the signaling, they issued shares to dilute again. And they said they would do even more next year. And as if that's not enough, now they propose to double the number of authorized shares. They are signaling to Simon: if you are going to tender an offer, we are going to dilute the share until its intrinsic value is well below your offer price. It is such a shame. We were looking at a potentially more than 200% gain here, either through stock price recovery or M&A, but now it is unlikely that this gain can be realized."
"If the non core mall they just sold, La Encantada, is representative of their average property then liquidation value of the company is $15.3B net of all debt, which is about $72 per share. Obviously there's no way to know the actual marketable value of all the properties but this simple example shows just how badly undervalued the market is pricing the company."
Best 5 year dividend stock.
just declared a 15 cents dividend payable December 3rd.
The Dec-A FINRA short report shows the short interest increased by 9%. Short interest is now up to 57% of the float. A massive short squeeze is coming with the vaccine.
"I understand that the short squeeze thing can cause a lot of anxiety. But try to ignore it for a while and concentrate on the fundamentals (like Warren Buffett buying a real business) and you can see this picture:1. The company you own began the year at $10.5 and ends the first month at $14. That's a third in a month.2. It releases Q4 earnings. Q4 is a quarter with the worst pandemic situation, albeit without a total lockdown like Q2. The results are fine. We see an operation still moderately affected by the pandemic. Nevertheless collection rose to 91% It isn't remotely close to bankruptcy or even unprofitability. the recovery thesis is firmly intact.3. The Fashion District Philadelphia issue is clarified and now we know that MAC did NOT throw away $100Mil. 4. Various loans are successfully extended with favorable terms. I am as satisfied as I was a month ago about this company. Regardless of what the market will say about it in the next week or two, my target remains at above $40 in 2-3 years."
"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1019271/crowd-sourcing-a-short-squeeze ""--Among stocks that have large short interest positions, there are a number that we rate from a fundamental perspective. The only stock with a high short-interest that we currently view as undervalued is Macerich (MAC). Over the past few years, Macerich has successfully become an owner and operator of Class A regional malls. While malls may need to reposition themselves following the pandemic and become more experimental, we think the market is undervaluing the firm’s long-term prospects."""
Set buy limit order 16.50 for tomorrow.
"Close above $18 2 days in a row, good sign! Fly from here"
14% of float still short. Good sign for further SP increase in 2022.
Strategies to fry the shorts? Raise the dividend.
"I bought MAC in December as an investment and thought nothing about any future short squeeze. The volatility over the past week doesn't deter my thinking and I still feel MAC is a good investment which I plan on holding for multiple years. The pandemic has shown retail it's achilleas heel and retail may never be the same as it was before, but the best retail locations (like MAC owns) will flourish again. They could even be busier than before as other lesser retail centers and locations go to the waste side. In short, the strongest retail locations will survive and prosper."
"RMB a year these suckers calling those $2 PT and bankruptcy on this prime A mall landord, which is now lower their debts, successfully renew the line of credit and refinance, try to improve for a better balance sheet. where are those suckers now. Esp the motley fool bitxhes and so call analysts lol. U guys can really suck some ds. well i was long here never change and average was $6."
The spike up and spike down in stock price is MM shaking trees to collect shares for short sellers. It is still very undervalued at current stock price. 2/11 earnings will give investors more confidence. Covid19 cases have peaked and going down fast.
Must hold 18.30 to break through the wedge formation from July successfully.
"The next two weeks should be interesting. All the investors who have shorted MAC have a couple of weeks until the Ex-Dividend Date (2/18). Normally, short sellers don't want to be on the hook for the dividend if they can help it. There will be many that will want to cover before that date and any increases to the stock price up to that date will just put that much more pressure on them. I only have a small 2200 share position in MAC and I didn't buy MAC in December for a possible future short squeeze, so I'm just going to sit back and watch the show (it's not like I can go to the movies these days). Good Luck MAC Holders...."

Buy @17.20-17-40 range. Earnings will be brilliant
"As Mike mentioned, wave 2 correction is happening now after the wave 1 (5 wave up) is completed. Once this is completed likely today or next couple of days, wave 3 of higher degree wave 3 will start which is huge. Looks like vaccine approval will occur during this wave 3 which could push the price big time as long as CA, NY & NJ do not lock down indoor malls again."
