Great day but we were here in July. We need to close above $19 and then I think we run a little.I figure last Q may have been a little better than expected. If so one could expect leaks to continue and the price to run a bit.
"If the non core mall they just sold, La Encantada, is representative of their average property then liquidation value of the company is $15.3B net of all debt, which is about $72 per share. Obviously there's no way to know the actual marketable value of all the properties but this simple example shows just how badly undervalued the market is pricing the company."
Both $MAC & $SPG are almost back to pre-covic level. Now I just them to increase the divvies back to the previous payments.
Set buy limit order 16.50 for tomorrow.
LOL pretty sure the Canada pension fund will be regret as hell when Mac recover by 2023 and reach $30-50.
"MAC about to drop the hammer in Q3 and Q4 of this year. P/FFO just over $7. Let's go!!! For however long they may need to continue issuing shares around $18 (which is almost 2X my basis of $11) they won't be raising the dividend. However, once they've stopped issuing shares, you can bet the dividend will be raised the next quarter or shortly thereafter. This company is going to booom."
"I've been to the Deptford Mall, Freehold Raceway Mall, Kings Plaza , all MAC malls and each time were crowded , and not many empty stores"
14% of float still short. Good sign for further SP increase in 2022.
Buy @17.20-17-40 range. Earnings will be brilliant
MAC is behaving better today. Made above 18.30 and holding and showing some strength.
"SEC reports that the Chief Accounting Officer for MAC sold 8,000 shares at $18.15 per share on 9-27-21."
Still above $18/share. Up from here. $18 is the floor now
"I bought MSC at $7.75, I'm doing good with it"
Check out Mac at MarketbeatInstitutional Ownership Percentage: 72.98%Look at who has been buying and selling overall.When you find companies with 80%+ buys vs less than 20% sells that IS a good signMore buyers and investors than sellers.
"Close above $18 2 days in a row, good sign! Fly from here"
"Question: MAC shares outstanding keeps going up. On 2-17-2021 shares outstanding was 160M.Now as of 6-30-2021 shares outstanding is 206M. Are the shares being given to the management in lieu of cash compensation? or, are the shares being sold? If sold in the market, there should be a record of such sales.This increase in shares outstanding is causing Book Value to continue to decline."
"SPG broke out and finally reached pre-pandemic price and SKT exceeded it but MAC is struggling to hang on to even 18. With massive stock dilution going on, this is not unexpected but it looks like it's not going any where until there is some good news such as dividend increase or something."
US opening back up to foreign travellers...this should help MAC centers which are concentrated in touristy areas
just declared a 15 cents dividend payable December 3rd.
"$18 Teflon floor holds today. Next stop, $20"
