Why did MAC go up with sudden high volume today? Something happening?
"Great day today, but still a long way to go before this stock is fairly valued. A dividend increase, a solid earnings report or an offer to buy the company will send it higher quick and hopefully force the short squeeze we are all hoping for."
Get ready for 0.50 divi. Ultimately malls will open and people will start going out. Confinement is not for humans. Online and other stuff will do well in qtr1 but qtr3 onwards there will be resurgence of people going out and spending great and fun times socially. Expect opposite of distancing once virus settles. At these level MAC great buy. The way rents will decrease or defer same way MAC obligations will be defered. Panic is the time to buy not sell. Buy.
Advice to new investors: this is a $50 stock with 3$ dividend per share so there is a lot of room to grow... welcome to the club
Seems like the longs are starting to get some legs under this thing. Didn't fall a ton as market declined.
"If a second round of dilution takes place, and assuming that the entirety of the $500Mil capacity is used up for issuing shares at $11.5 on average, and also assuming that the number of shares was 149.7mil originally and 185.7mil after the first round of dilution, then the impact of two rounds of dilution is calculated as follows: (Perceived share price before dilutions, Implied share price after 2 rounds of dilution, Implied discount)$10 $10.8 8%premium$15 $14.1 6%discount$20 $17.4 13%discount$25 $20.6 17%discount$30 $23.9 20%discount$35 $27.2 22%discount$40 $30.4 24%discountThis is obviously a very large negative impact on the valuation of MAC shares (unless you perceive the shares to be worth less than $11.5 of course). Revising your valuation from say $40 to $30 is no small issue. On the other hand, my previous point still stand: if your original valuation is less bullish, then the dilution won't affect you much. If your original valuation is very bullish, it should affect you a lot but not at the current market price. There are two issues I don't quite understand about this potential new round of dilution. First, why did management immediately file for another round of equity issuance? Without this extra round, the news of settling the unsecured debt should undoubtedly a piece of positive news that would raise the share price. If management simply delay the filing for several days, or even just one day, they should be able to issue the second round with a much more favorable average price.Second, why would management give out an updated 2021 EPS and per-share FFO guidance on Mar 26th if they are to immediately issue more shares right afterwards, rendering these guidance for 2021 immediately meaningless? One possibility is that it is an SEC regulatory requirement in terms of the timing and the guidance. Anyone who knows better please enlighten us. A more optimistic take would be that it is an indication of MAC not going to go about a second round in the foreseeable future."
having held since apr may 2020 happy to see this value play start to get recognized. hard to lose long term when you buy at discount to book value. holding for higher levels later this year
"I'm quite disappointed with the performance of this stock. I am in at $6.00 with 5,500 shares respectively, and there is absolutely no reason why $MAC should not be trading at $10-15 today. This stock is one of the best risk-reward investments on the market today: They have more cash on their balance sheet than what they are trading for in today's market - downside risk is minimal and the event of bankruptcy is extremely unlikely in the presence of COVID. $MAC is a perfect example of a completely misunderstood company with high upside potential - making it one of the most undervalued stocks in today's market, despite the recent market crash. In the event of their earnings being released, I was really anticipating some big movements today - very disappointing. Disclosure: I am long Macerich"
"Feb 19 $30 call interest building up nicely. It tripled today.This is the cheap way, ahead of time, to amplify a coming short short squeeze prior to the GME folks bringing their megaloot ($6b today) over here to gorge on the stock."
Can anyone paste here Q results?
"Maybe I don't know enough about shorting stocks, but I have to believe most investors who are in a short position borrowed their shares when MAC was at $11 or below. I assume investors who shorted before 2019 (or maybe very recently when it went over $20) would have got out and collected their earnings. For the short investors still in the game, they have been on the hook for fees and dividends (with another one coming up). If I understand the fees correctly, then an investor borrowing $10,000 worth of MAC shares at the current rate is paying about $1.50 in fees a day. So for every quarter, the shoert investor (with the additional $.15 dividend) would owe about $250 (after a year, it would be about $1,000 on their initial $10,000 investment).So the longer the short investor waits means they need the stock price to fall that much further to make money or just to break even.Am I missing something in my thoughts or calculations? I'm not predicting a short squeeze, but it does appear to me that short holders (who borrowed at $11 and below) are in a poor position now as the economy picks up and the pandemic dissipates"
"SPG beat, shorts will want yr MAC,,, Hold, don't sell. Go MAC"
There's a huge problem. There were no transactions and hence there was zero price discovery. We need to see some liquidations to see the real value of retail real estate assets! $WPG $PEI $MAC $SPG
"I made this comment as a speculation when they first announced the share dilution, but now I am more certain with the latest AGM proposal --- it is a quasi-poison pill designed by management to keep their jobs at the expense of billions worth of shareholder value. They know that Simon has always wanted the company. They know that their managerial missteps make a good reason for their dismissal. They know that MAC's mall assets are the best in the industry and the shares are worth multiple times the current price. If Simon offers >$30/share, shareholders will immediately say yes, Simon will land a bargain deal, and management will be fired. So this den of thieves issued shares to dilute, in the name of improving leverage. To enhance the signaling, they issued shares to dilute again. And they said they would do even more next year. And as if that's not enough, now they propose to double the number of authorized shares. They are signaling to Simon: if you are going to tender an offer, we are going to dilute the share until its intrinsic value is well below your offer price. It is such a shame. We were looking at a potentially more than 200% gain here, either through stock price recovery or M&A, but now it is unlikely that this gain can be realized."
"Company is coming out of this Strong, just like they came out of 2008 great financial crisis. Just look at the chart during the GFC and how the company came out of it, history is going to repeat itself. Below is a couple of comments from the CC. GLTAL""Cash flow is improving by the month as we move into the third quarter and I expect that to continue.""""And although, there's still many uncertainties, we can I think clearly say that the third and fourth quarter will be much better than the second quarter of 2020."""
"The FINRA Feb-A report out today shows that 56% of the shorts covered in the recent rally. There are still 34.3M shares short which is 24.5% of the float, and it will be harder for those shorts to cover because there are fewer and fewer long term holders willing to sell with the great REIT reopening just getting started. Earnings will be much better later in 2021 and especially 2022 with the Google office space delivery. Definitely headed up from here, both share price and dividend."
"While up markedly from Covid crash lows, MAC still has plenty of room to run. One of the two largest Class A mall operators in the U.S. along with Simon Property. These are the city centers where the best retailers and restauranteurs alike want to be. Expect no less than $25 per share by EOY."
"Let’s do an exercise to figure out how much mall assets MAC owns. According to their 10Q, they own $6.5 Billion internally and $1.5 billion with joint venture. That is $8 billion in mall assets. They owe $4.3 Billion in mortgages. If we assume that they finance their mortgage at 50%. That means half of MAC malls are worth $8.6 Billion with $5.3 Billion mortgage. Another $8.6 billion is mortgage free. So their total mall assets are about $17.2 Billion. That is $10.7 Billion more than they stated in the 10Q. So MAC is worth $13 billion. That is $87 per share in assets. No wonder they won’t sell to SPG for $91 per share. MAC’s land are worth a fortune. MAC is superrich."
Hope the David Simon comes along again to knock on the door... He offered 91$/share in 2015 for Macerich.
"Recovery stocks have taken a great hit during the past two months, because of the fear of the delta variant and the potential second lock down. This won't happen, because:1. Although the number of new covid cases in the US has been rising quickly, it is very regional. States where MAC has a strong presence (NY, California, Penn, NJ) have high vaccination rates and much smaller increase in cases. Even Arizona, which has a relatively low vaccination rate, fares pretty well. 2. This time round the high number of cases does not translate into a high rate of hospitalizations and deaths. You can check the charts. Very telling. Lock down risk is further reduced.3. The above point is partly due to vaccination, but also the way they treat covid patients have made a lot of progress to date. It is not just a vaccine and vaccination story. 4. Speaking of that, looking into the near future, a breakthrough has been made in terms of nanobodies as a highly potent treatment of covid which can be mass produced economically on a global scale. See this:https://scitechdaily.com/highly-potent-covid-treatment-new-nanobodies-stop-sars-cov-2-and-its-dangerous-variants/So unless a super variant resistant to all of the above efforts suddenly emerges, there is very little risk of a second lock down."
We will see the 20 dollar range by the end of the year or maybe beginning of 2022. Be patient. :)
"If you think you should sell, look at MAC chart after the great financial crisis, specifically look at July 1st through August 31st 2009. The price action was identical, it dropped in mid July and hovered around mid $16/share, and popped to $25+ the first week of August 2009. It saw $35/share a few months later. Hold onto your shares people, don't let the big boys play games your money."
MAC's dividend is solid. Sooner are latter Greed will take over fear. Good luck to all Longs
"The CFO of this company needs to be fired. If not the entire management team. By announcing this enormous shelf offering, they basically capped the upside, enabling the shorts to sell at will. This also tells the existing longs there is a cap on the stock so they decide to move on. The entire investor base of this stock now knows that if the stock goes up, the company will sell into it, thus holding it down."
"In case you're not aware, MAC's 10K (results for Q1) is already out, and SPG had a press release of its Q1 results out as well. The tldr is:SPG beats on both revenue and FFO/share.MAC beats revenue but is only in line with FFO/share.Probably the only reason why MAC didn't beat the expected FFO/share is the significant increase in the number of the shares during the quarter, and there is no way for the company to deploy the money raised quickly enough to contribute to operating cash flow."
Points regarding the credit facility recast (from last earnings call):-MAC has a 25 year relationship with their lending groups and negotiations have progressed well -MAC can secure a line of their unsecured credit with their unencumbered assets -MAC has enough unencumbered assets to support their $1.5b debt -MAC has over $500m in liquidity if they have to recast to a lower lending commitment -MAC expects to generate significant excess cash in 2021 to pay down debt and leverage-MAC filed to renew the ATM only as a tool and option at an attractive stock price
"Seems the recovery started! According to the earnings, lots of interest for new tenants seen lately which will increase occupancy and profitability. Also, customers coming back will help rent collections and reduce needs for abatement. They are also canceling debt and reducing risk. Based on prior recessions, this might triple by end of 2022. I am already above my purchase price and enjoying the dividend while I see that price appreciation!"
"what waves are you talking about???? the price will be raised only by dividends, the price will go by 20 with a dividend of 0.25. well, nothing else moves this paper. if they announce 0.15 again now, then we will see the price again at 13 dollars"
"My guess is the depressed stock price is due to the concern on LOC. As soon as LOC is renewed without dilution, MAC jumps over $20."
you can buy MAC x8 cheaper than SPG but collect a dividend 50% of SPG.
I’m buying tomorrow and holding for the big event coming next week 
MAC could be next GEM. based on such high short ratio.
"Happy dividend day everyone. We finally closed above 11.00, reaching as high as 11.59 today. Still trading well below book value though (P/B = 0.63), and with vaccines bringing the virus panic to an end we should see the dividend increasing in upcoming quarters, until it is finally back to its pre-lockdown levels."
Any old-time longs know why this stock was going way down before Covid? I picked up a few shares but may buy more. Just trying to find out why it was dropping so much before Covid. Thanks
"It's true!!!!! I have googled ""nasdaq GME real time trades"".So many of the trades are 100 shares of GME each time, retail investors dont have such money to trade 100x230 each trade lmao. it's so madenning how this could be allowed, even a retail investor like me could see through this fraud. Please spread this message around, ao that people could witness this with their own eyes!!!!!$GME $AMC $BB $NAKD $NOK $EXPR"
FFO 2021 guidance $2.05 - $2.25 This should support $25 share price
I called MAC today and Jean Wood from investor relations called me back and said I made alot of good points about them to issue press releases to alert the investment community about positives going on at the company
Let’s assume MAC can at least pay $2.5 annual dividend. 8% dividend rate means $31 stock price. This is the minimum stock price target
"44 of 47 properties now fully reopened!! Last 3 properties are in LA County. Also, all TT's who didn't rely on common area entrances have been fully open for months (even at the remaining ""closed"" properties). This thing is going to pop. Lines out the door at the CA and NY reopenings. Brick and Mortar retail, at the high end level, is not and will not die. Tesla has been leasing out a ton of brick and mortar spaces from Macerich and others. Amazon is doing the same. Things may evolve but physical foot traffic is irreplaceable. As are the locations of macerich's shopping centers. They also widdled down their portfolio over the peak of the market, so the deadweight is gone (unlike Taubman and Simon). This thing will do a repeat of 2008 no doubt."
"Last week I traveled to Phoenix and visited the MAC malls and the SKT outlet while I was there. The MAC malls are very high end and in very desirable locations. Here's something I posted on the SKT board:I visited the Phoenix outlet on Sunday evening 1/5/2020. It's located in a great area close to the AZ Cardinals stadium and it was packed. I had to park in the farthest corner of the lot. Just wanted to see how traffic looked but ended up spending about $500 on the family. Bargains were amazing and nearly impossible to resist. Not sure what margins are for the various retailers but I can say sales volume is very high, as nearly every shopper had multiple bags of stuff. F21 and a couple other ""bankrupt"" retailers were open with plenty of inventory at this location.I recently entered a position in this name and have added to near my intended max. People that think malls/outlets are dying clearly don't go to these malls. I also visited the MAC malls in the greater Phoenix area several times over the past week and they were very busy as well. The MAC Scottsdale mall is HUGE. There would probably have to be 75k+ people in the mall for it to feel packed. Parking lots in the areas I parked were near full. The Apple stores were packed although I didn't see a lot of people actually walking out with stuff."
"Would love to see a big beat, but let’s face it, MAC doesn’t have the balance sheet that SPG does. I’m hoping for the best but expecting a meh. MACs time will come, I’m just not as confident that the time is tomorrow."
"2 great MAC articles from Seeking Alpha and Motley Fool this morning, along with the Duetsche Bank Upgrade."

"I'm in my early twenties currently have no job, live in Germany and am in for the next 5-10 years at roughly 9k Euros/Dollars. It's by far my biggest position and maybe I will even increase the stake by selling ponzi bitcoin. After all, Macerich is a cash machine."
Buying tech stocks is like drug addiction. After one day of break in tech stocks and money moved to recovery stocks. It is back to chasing tech stocks again. Unbelievable.

This is gut-wrenching ; I hope that we are not underestimating the credit risk with MAC - all other RETIs are doing well today
MAC is a top 10 heavily shorted stock and should squeeze at some pointhttps://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-heavily-shorted-stocks-primed-for-epic-squeezes-analysts-say-gamestop/?src=A00220
"MAC Dividend announced this morning, 15 cents payable September 8th."
"With PEI coming to terms with 80% of its lenders to completely refinance its debt, MAC is likely to see a pop tomorrow. MAC has much better credit than PEI and yet is still trading as if BK is right around the corner."
Currently at the Mall of America. It's packed.
Simon beat FFO and earnings estimates. Great sign for leasing and occupancies recovery.
"Hey new investor here. Whose this guy, @fig, who thinks that Mac is headed for a correction? How could an already severely undervalued mall company (in terms of FFO/sh relative to competitors) with non-recourse loans and top value assets be headed for a correction even with a market downturn?If anything, their assets would get bought up at a steep markup like TCO’s did, and that’s worst case scenario.With high rent collection and e-commerce companies renting out space, you can’t even make the retailpocalypse argument. Btw, “pumpers” is a term used for a security that is being overbought. Considering this one has 58% short interest, refer to us as contrarians."
"This is a classic short term bad news long term likely great news.How much do you factor each probability?Short term MAC has lower occupancy, lower rent collections, lower dividend and loan covenant issues.Long term, there are numerous new vaccines, for the cause of MAC's largest problems, Covid 19, The new therapeutic from Israel that appears to be a Covid cure, MAC has many of the countries best locations, numerous projects that will be on line increasing rent collections, only pays an average 3.7% on its debt, and as a REIT its rising rent collections should result in significant dividend increases.The price is a balancing act. What makes MAC more exciting than most is the large short position can double the number of buyers if the good future begins to outweigh the negative near term. Some of the buyers (shorts now) may even panic buy since their loss can be unlimited (short squeeze). All in all an interesting but risky stock to own long, as I do."
Malls are reopened debt is manageable coronavirus cases and deaths continue to decline at a rapid pace... book value of 16.73<
"if MAC had bad management they would have ended up like PREIT and Washington Prime, thankfully over the years they built a portfolio of great assets with great locations , now we benefit from the moves they had made and continue to make"
"Big players are manipulating MAC price. eTrade changed margin maintenance requirement to 75% yesterday morning. Then, they changed it to 100% afternoon after market closed. On top of that, eTrade require margin due today which is literally require funding right away. Either eTrade is exposed to short squeeze risk from their short-sell clients or getting pressure from big players somewhere to make such change. By changing the margin requirement to 100% and immediate due on margin call, it forces selling. The rise of MAC has nothing to do with GME frenzy (except for 1 day) but being drag down by it. I had to liquidate all of my other holding in my portfolio to fulfil the margin call. BUT, I AM KEEPING MAC. Be patient, more volatility ahead of us but MAC will prevail. DO NOT SELL."
"PJT is also an investment bank with the connection to potential buyers. It is possible that in order to manage the debt, MAC would like to sell some of its unencumbered assets, and need to find buyers via PJT. A lot of PJT deals under ""strategic advisory"" are acquisitions related."
"SPG is richly valued,mac isn't"
Will short squeezing return tomorrow? Thumbs up if you think price will rise more than 5% tomorrow. Thumbs down if you think price will drop more than 5% tomorrow.
Not impressed by 2021 guidance which projects lower FFO for next two quarters unless they are trying to surprise.
"folks, what other stocks do you all recommend? (similar growth as mac)"
"We finally managed to close above $14.25. Hopefully that becomes a floor instead of a ceiling. On the flipside I beleive this morning's run up to $15.56 becomes the new ceiling until the dividend gets raised, at that price the dividend yield is only 3.89%, and I just can't see bulk buying by serious long term investors for a yield much below 4%."
In some serious pain after last 2 days....
Anyone think this is so they can cover?https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/08/why-these-7-us-mall-owners-including-simon-are-in-trouble-sp.html
"From 2011 to 2019, MAC operated with $100-200M cash on hand. Only reason MAC increased the liquidity to over $500 in 2020 by drawing all of LOC is due to pandemic. At worst case MAC will have $150 cash left after LOC is paid off in July. But, assuming they will keep 15c dividend at least until June quarter, they will have another $100M cash saved up from FFO by July which means they will end up with at least $250M cash. This is the worst case. Best case scenario is they will have $350M after LOC payoff in which case they will end up with $450M which is plenty. Based on their historical cash level in normal times, likelihood of selling any more stock even at worst case scenario is very low as long as another lockdown does not happen in the future."
"The fact that we are holding above 11 right now , with both options expiration, and a potential stimulus package being passed by tomorrow is a positive IMO."
Couldn’t resist and bought a bunch more at the close. GLTA leading into earnings.
"Waiting to see what the MAC brain trust says on Thursday. Keep in mind the top 5 get $10 million in salaries and declined a $90 share buyout from SPG.Oh! we are doing are best but due to covid we can't raise dividend, buy back stock or increase cash flow.What do you want for our million dollar salaries."

As of March 25, 2021, approximately 1.0 million shares remain available to be issued under the program.The Company is under contract to sell a 95% interest in Paradise Valley Mall, a non-core asset in Phoenix, AZ, for $100 million to a newly formed joint venture. The transaction is expected to close in late March 2021, and is anticipated to generate net proceeds of approximately $95 million to the Company. The Company will retain a 5% joint venture interest in this multi-year redevelopment.The Company has obtained commitments from its joint lead lenders, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs for a new revolving line of credit and credit facility. The total capacity of the line and the credit facility is expected to be between $600 million and $800 million, with the facility expected to close in April 2021.As of March 25, 2021, the Company has cash and cash equivalents, including pro-rata share of joint ventures, of approximately $950 million. Expected total liquidity after the close of the new credit facility and the Paradise Valley sale is expected to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.85 billion prior to paying off the current line of credit."

"One thing is sure, we cannot trust Mac management at all. Share issuing was supposed to be very unlikely at these low share price on last conference call, and all that LOC negociation was supposed to be under control, but then they hired PJT a few days later and now they diluted.Yes their financial position is now better.Yes the stock is still undervalued.And tenants like LB Brands increasing their earnings forecast for the year is very bullish for the whole retail and mall sector.But do I like being treated like a sheep? No, not at all!"
CNBC now tagging MAC on heavy shorted stocks!
"The downgrades just added to my confidence , I have been in many, many stocks early like this and the downgrades always come in so they can build there positions before it runs away from ""them"". Keep in mind it can take months for someone like JPM for example to take a position! Last thing that they want is for Mac to get to $20-25 before they are ready!!! Mac 23PT June 2021 be patient"
"Wall Street Bets (new) is back up. The announcement that they closed the forum literally caused all of the high short stocks to selloff. Every possible tactic is being used to try to control the mania. Don’t buy into it. The facts are simple- MAC is highly shorted, it’s business model is returning to health, and it’s worth more than the current price. Hang tight"

"Options expire tomorrow, so there will be more volatility. However, after that we should be good next week.￼"
Have we gone from earnings to losses? How many years to turn around?
"With MAC you get the best of both worlds. There are a lot of stocks that are good value plays, and there are a handful of stocks which are currently vulnerable targets for a GME-style short squeeze, but MAC is the only one I see which gives you both. It gives you the great upside of a potential short squeeze, with the downside protection of a stable and profitable underlying business (MAC owns some of the best real estate in the world). That is why 90% of my portfolio is in this stock."
"There is some major rotation from last year's mega cap tech stocks into value and dividend stocks. This includes all the mall REITs --- MAC, SPG, SKT, PEI, WPG, EPR, and many energy names like EPD, VLO, AR, AM, ET, and others.Add that rotation and the end of shutdowns to the huge short interest in a few of these names and you're set up for 2x to 6x gains in short order."
"Any possibility for $MAC management announce increased dividend rate on 4th of August, its earning day?"
"Unlike GME and AMC which has no fundamentals, MAC is a solid undervalued company with huge short interest of 78 million. The worst it can happen is you get 20% dividend starting next year. In the mean time, dividend will gradually increase from 60c to $3."
"I am 30 yrs old and prob worth about $400k (not to brag but just to put into perspective the ""size"" investor I am). I work in commercial real estate as an asset manager, and have been keeping an eye on this company for quite some time. The fundamentals didn't make sense, and it's solely because of the shorts. So, before the pandemic I invested about $30K at a $24 share price. Once the pandemic hit, obviously this drove it down even further. However, I kept buying this thing all the way down the the ground because I feel absolute conviction in this company. It is in NO way a meme company. This company was trading over the summer at $6-$8 and had a Q2 FFO of $0.55. Take some time to read the past few earnings call transcripts...this company is going to surge. They reduced dividend by $0.15 and even said ON THE EARNINGS CALLS that this allowed them to pocket an additional $400M per year for the company to just hold in case things got rough, or they were unable to refinance. Well...fast forward and rent collections are probably now north of 90% (guessing as I am a CRE asset manager and we have some malls in our portfolio). This should now bring their FFO probably back to around $0.70-$0.75. They've kept the dividend the same at $0.15 per share, and as of the last quarter there were roughly 141M shares. Do the math... $0.75 AFFO per share minus the dividend = $0.50/share ""saved"" by the company. This equates to a cash pile generation of ~$70.5M in ONE QUARTER while still paying out a ~4% dividend at these prices. They also have a huge 500K SF office retail project completely pre-leased to GOOGLE which will be up by 2022. Part of me thinks they didn't bump the dividend to purposefully not join the GME craze (in case they want to be acquired), but that's just me hypothecating because normally they've run a ""tight"" dividend moat, but right now they are only paying out about 20% of the dividend and pocketing the rest to ""sure"" things up. It's another way to obviously recycle ""free money"" to drive up share prices to meet future dividends. I have absolutely ZERO doubt that the dividend will be back to $0.75 within a year or two, and for that reason, I will 100% be keeping my 5000 shares with a basis of $11. I bought it all the way down to average by initial 30K at $24 per share, down to now about $70K with a basis of $11. I could have made a quick buck but then I remembered I am an investor and not a ""trader."" Good luck to all other longs!!!"
Shambles!
Looks like MAC is struggling to hold onto gain due to Delta variant scare which will be a headwind for a while.
"One indirect consequence of the pandemic is that interest rates have now dropped to 0%. MAC investors have ignored this important piece of information. But as we get to the other side of this crisis, the 0% interest rates will serve as a major catalyst for MAC. Their FFO is growing daily, so will the dividends in time. Good luck to all Longs"
"I only have 25,000 shares so small investor for now in this position. I like the $3750 dividend for quarter, like being owner of premium property and like the large discount in price compared to historical price."
"Please don't believe these analysts. Go look at LYV (Live Nation). Losing money, no revenues at all and no revenue in 2021. The stock is back to Jan 2020 levels and these analysts dont say anything. Please do your DD and you will see that with low interest rates, MAC is bringing their spending down and will be back to 30s in 6-12 months. People will definitely flock to malls after this COVID homestay. Do what your gut tells you.. and go with it."
Ban shorting.
Missed feg and big cap zolly since they ve been brought us alot of joy . Asked for roast every day.
"if you get an urge to sell, look at the long term chart here. A giant ABC pattern. 2009 and 2020 bottom. It went up 700% from the 2009 bottom within a year. 2,000% in 6 years."
"700,000 jobs added in June. More spending helps secure mall business climb back to normal."
"Economic recovery continuing, consumer spending left and right and going out; analyst raising price target (while below current price)… signal we are in the recover phase for MAC and soon to climb above 20. Will keep patient and this will grow a few X from here."
"I understand that the short squeeze thing can cause a lot of anxiety. But try to ignore it for a while and concentrate on the fundamentals (like Warren Buffett buying a real business) and you can see this picture:1. The company you own began the year at $10.5 and ends the first month at $14. That's a third in a month.2. It releases Q4 earnings. Q4 is a quarter with the worst pandemic situation, albeit without a total lockdown like Q2. The results are fine. We see an operation still moderately affected by the pandemic. Nevertheless collection rose to 91% It isn't remotely close to bankruptcy or even unprofitability. the recovery thesis is firmly intact.3. The Fashion District Philadelphia issue is clarified and now we know that MAC did NOT throw away $100Mil. 4. Various loans are successfully extended with favorable terms. I am as satisfied as I was a month ago about this company. Regardless of what the market will say about it in the next week or two, my target remains at above $40 in 2-3 years."
"With borrowing cheap and inflation on the rise, I expect MAC will be taken private sometime soon. Think about it! I borrow money for nothing, then use it to buy a massive property owner on the cheap. I know some will say malls are dying, but not Class M malls like those owned by MAC. The property they own and the land under them will only increase in value as long as inflation continues trending upward. Only one thing stopping this in my opinion, a quick run up in share price. Say mid-high-$20's. Just my opinions."
"Watch their debt-load development on their balance sheet this quarter. They are focusing on that, instead of increasing dividend. Scoop up the divs and be happy the company is focusing on making the company stronger and more durable."
"As Mike mentioned, wave 2 correction is happening now after the wave 1 (5 wave up) is completed. Once this is completed likely today or next couple of days, wave 3 of higher degree wave 3 will start which is huge. Looks like vaccine approval will occur during this wave 3 which could push the price big time as long as CA, NY & NJ do not lock down indoor malls again."
It’s so inconceivable to me that folks would rather short MAC than bet somewhere else in what is highly expected to be broad market boom. MAC will double if not triple from here depending on your time horizon. We only need one domino of good news and this will fly.
"Nice and Steady....Said this last year November.And here we are $10 higher.It may take 6-8 years, but I do see MAC heading back to $80sGreat LONG term stock to own. History repeats itself with stocks like MAC. You get bottom, you make lots of $$"
"When the Dow & Nasdaq are down more then MAC, you know money transfer is happening...."
New short data as of 1-15 is out. Total short is 78.54 million shares. A reduction of only 2 million with a rise of $4 in stock price from $11 to $14.
"I am doubtful that the market will favor MAC in the short run. Having the LOC problem cleared is potentially a great booster, but MAC management promptly spoils the party by filing for another prospectus ($500Mil). The possibility that MAC is going for another round of dilution will likely be a drag. Having said that, if another round is imminent, then why would MAC issue an EPS guidance for 2021? This is indeed strange."
"Hold the line , brother and sisters, spread the words out.Another biggest short float company, Macerich Company (MAC)https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/l5ea1b/another_biggest_short_float_company_macerich/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
"Hah! This thing is the biggest steal out there right now. I own 5000 shares and am not a ""big league"" investor so that is a big chunk of ""net worth"" if you will haha. However, think about this, in April of Q2 they collected something like 26% of their rent and they still had an FFO for the quarter of $0.39 per share by quarters end. I work in commercial real estate. Collections for these high end TT's is improving, as they clearly outlined on the call, and therefore I don't think it's unreasonable to expect FFO around $0.60 for Q2. While they are doing this, they are also conserving piles of cash to help pay down debt and repurpose parts of their portfolio that will be required for in this next cycle. Buying at $8, say the FFO for the year shakes out to an annualized rate of $0.60 per quarter. Even then, that is $2.40, meaning your share for $8 is really already yielding 30%. The dividend will come back with the increasing FFO. Buy in now and I bet within a year your money is yielding at least 25%+. Worth noting, I am a yields investor, not pump and dump day-trading."

A quadropia of good news today:1) Scotiabank upgrades price target to from 16.00 to 19.002) Deutsche Bank upgrades price target from 20.00 to 24.003) Positive article published on Seeing Alpha4) Positive article published on Motley FoolClearly a sign that sentiment is changing around MAC. I predict more upgrades to follow in the coming months and that the stock price will continue to rise in response.
Completed my additional buys today to put my MAC position at 40% of my portfolio. Extremely confident in management to keep MAC at the top of the REIT list. This company has proven time and time again that they know what it takes to survive and thrive in any environment! See ya in 5 years!
Employment news is great for MAC! This is a $20 stock this summer and $30 the end of the year!
"The news today cannot be interpreted as all-good. After all, there is an equity dilution, and bulls here (including myself) thought that it wouldn't take a dilution to resolve the LOC issue. Now that it involves an asset sale and a equity issuance, let's see what's the good and the bad of it. The good news is, obviously, that the relatively high financial leverage so badly perceived by the market is now over. Moreover, the risk of a debt non-extension in July is now nullified. Basically, illiquidity in any foreseeable future is should no longer be anyone's concern (err... except fig, of course), and MAC is in a good position to embrace a recovery rally.Now we want to see what price MAC has to pay for the above. it sold a 95% stake of the Paradise Valley Mall in Arizona for (net) $95 Mil. It will take more information and further analysis to know how much of a fire sale this $95Mil represents, but it is safe to say that under the current market condition it will be at least somewhat a bargain deal for the counterparty. Having said that, Paradise Valley Mall isn't a crown jewel of MAC's portfolio: it is a declining old mall last improved 20 years ago; and it is only a 20-min ride from MAC's flagship Scottsdale Fashion Square, rendering it somewhat redundant. A redevelopment project under a JV was just approved last month, meaning that MAC probably hasn't spent much on it yet. Now it just sold its stake to its JV partner.MAC issued 36 million shares at $13.54 to raise USD 487Mil. There are two implications. First, the higher number of shares will lower any profitability measure (such as EPS, FFO/share), regardless of the issuing price. But this kind of dilution is all right, because it is just a normal risk-return trade-off (you earn less but you're less geared). Second, the issuing price relative to its true original value determines whether value is created or destroyed. If you believe that MAC's true value before the share issuance is say $12, you should be happy that it issues more shares at $13.54, because it improves the true value on a weighted average basis. Since most of us believe that MAC's true value before share issuance is way above $13.54, the issuance lowers the true value, and that is the cost we pay for the risk elimination mentioned above.But by how much? Some simple calculations based on the 149.7 million shares at the end of 2020 show the following: (the first column is the perceived true value before issuance, the second is the true value after issuance, the third is the implied discount)$15 $14.7 2% discount$20 $18.7 6% discount$25 $22.8 9% discount$30 $26.8 11% discount$35 $30.8 12% discount$40 $34.8 13% discount$45 $38.9 14% discountIt should be apparent that if you are not that bullish on MAC (say you value it at only $15 before issuance), then the impact of 2% isn't significant at all. MAC's share price can move more than that any single day. If, on the other hand, you value MAC much higher prior to issuance (say, like me, you value it at $40), then you need to substantially revise downward your valuation (by 13% in this case). It is a substantial price paid for risk elimination. But then, at the current price of $12.5, both a $40 valuation and a $34.8 valuation should both imply a strong buy."
"really good press release this morning, adding more Primark leases to the MAC portfolio."
Shorts at IB shorted 1.7 million shares this morning
"On Monday, broad market has high chance of bounce. Gap up or initial plunge then bounce up."
This what we know:1) $4 trillion in USA savings2) $2 trillion stimulus 3) vaccine roll out completed by end of July4) new infrastructure plan $1-$3 trillion5) My favorite - Toy R Us opening stores again.6) week/old strip malls closing - shift of stores to higher class malls.7) Sell Price recovery form great recession went from $6 up to $90.8) Last of all is new management.
"The next two weeks should be interesting. All the investors who have shorted MAC have a couple of weeks until the Ex-Dividend Date (2/18). Normally, short sellers don't want to be on the hook for the dividend if they can help it. There will be many that will want to cover before that date and any increases to the stock price up to that date will just put that much more pressure on them. I only have a small 2200 share position in MAC and I didn't buy MAC in December for a possible future short squeeze, so I'm just going to sit back and watch the show (it's not like I can go to the movies these days). Good Luck MAC Holders...."
Simon has resumed talks to acquire MAC back in 2015 it fell apart. Good for SPG they can get MAC cheaper at that time it was $91 /share now it might be $20 or $30.
"Redevelopment:While the Company reduced its 2020 development expenditures by approximately $100 million to conserve resources in light of the uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic, work progressed on selected projects. Notably: ? One Westside in Los Angeles, a 584,000 square foot creative office redevelopment, continues on schedule with a planned delivery to Google in early 2022. ? Restoration Hardware Gallery opened at The Village at Corte Madera in Corte Madera, CA. ? Comcast, #$%$s Sporting Goods (?#$%$s?) and Round One opened within the majority of the former Sears store at Deptford Mall in Deptford, NJ. ? #$%$s opened within a portion of the former Sears store at Vintage Faire Mall in Modesto, CA. ? #$%$s opened in a newly expanded footprint within a portion of the former Forever 21 store at Danbury Fair in Danbury, CT. ? Saratoga Hospital opened within the former Sears store at Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs, NY."
"I'm going to level with you all, this stock is going to continue to trickle down until the latest COVID 19 resurgence comes under control. I'm not saying this stock shouldnt be at $12+ right now, only that the money to support that is waiting on the sidelines. I think we need to hit somewhere in the $6's for more money to pour in. I saw the value when it was in the 5's and bought, and sold in the 12's when I felt it was too much too soon, and now I'm one of those people on the sidelines. Longs dont need good luck, this stock will be back over $10+, its not a question of that, its a question of how much lower is it going to go before we want to get back on the MAC train."
"Looking at chart structure, C wave which I thought was completed 2 weeks ago continued and made a large ABC subwave down as of last Monday and an impulsive minor 5 wave which started on Monday completed today which is likely is subwave 1 of final larger degree wave 5. After a minor correction, subwave 3 of wave 5 likely will start in coming days which may advance MAC toward 20."
"What does this stock need to hold its low value, let alone go up? So frustrating!"
"According to the ""short interest ratio"" (which is the days it would take for all shorts to cover at an average volume day), MAC (15) is MUCH higher than GME (6) or BBBY (11).This means that, compared to trading float and volume, MAC would have a much bigger price surge with any successful short squeeze than the others. Furthermore, for what it is worth, MAC is a solid company with decent book value."
"https://bizwest.com/2021/06/11/macerich-eyes-partial-flatiron-crossing-redevelopment/#Brick and mortar retail is not dead. People are social animals and Macerich is much more than a retail REIT. It has very valuable land. Just think of the parking lots, for instance and where they are located. If I am wrong, and retail will in fact die, then there's a huge potential for redevelopment like this one at FlatIron Crossing. The land is the margin of safety for me. And I collect part of the rent via dividends while waiting for an exciting future in retail or in residential/mixed use."
"We are heading back to 18's and new high. Technically, we gain 1$/month on average since vaccine news on nov 9th."
The spike up and spike down in stock price is MM shaking trees to collect shares for short sellers. It is still very undervalued at current stock price. 2/11 earnings will give investors more confidence. Covid19 cases have peaked and going down fast.
MAC is down 5.41% to 15.56
Interesting that MAC announced earning date before SPG. Management is confidant and financials must be moving in a positive direction.
"1. Macerich MAC owns 47 regional shopping malls near big urban centers in the United States. As of Oct 7, all of its properties had finally reopened. Rent collections have been improving since the spring. In the third quarter rent collections were at 80%, up from 61% in the second quarter. Macerich has resumed paying a dividend. Shares popped on the vaccine news, but are still cheap with a forward P/E of just 3.8x."
"Great thesis from another board:They need to issue PR in relation to this. Clearly they aren’t diluting.. They do not need to hire a debt adviser to dilute shares to deal with debt.. My guess is they have an offer from consortium of banks, but are dealing with complex structuring of loans related to unencumbered assets and other complex instruments... and they don’t want to finalize anything until they are confident it is the best possible terms they can achieve... watch this pivot and blow up in shorts faces.. or watch paper hands kick themselves when this takes off once we get clarity.."
"Oh, Reuben Gregg Brewer, there must be some reason you can't leave MAC alone. Thinking you bought at $35, sold at $6, and now all you want to do is try to kill it."
I could have bought other stocks that have easily doubled by now but I find it much more rewarding making money from this historic short squeeze happening right before us. GO MAC GO!!!
"At first glance MAC seems like a bad buy. Shopping malls are (supposedly) in a secular decline and MAC has a relatively high debt load. Wall Street analyst price targets , earnings estimates and the short % of float reflect this sentiment.If you dig further you find that the best contrarian investment authors all love this stock. The best part is that they all have very rational, simple arguments as to why this stock is setting up for amazing gains over the coming months and years. A class Malls will survive and thrive and the debt load of MAC is manageable. All MAC really has to do is return to normal valuations (estimates varying from 30 to 60 usd per share). This stock will only be driven more by the impending short squeeze. This is the best stock to own in the market right now."
MAC short interest decreased by only 3% to 57% and has a short ratio of 11 days to cover
"Between a rock and a hard place. MAC wants good terms for the LOC refinance. They see their numbers increasing with the end of the pandemic. The longer they have to improve their numbers, the better deal they should get for the long term. $1.5 billion! Even a 1% savings is $15 million a year. That is almost $.10 a share more for dividends per year. The problem is the near term and some shareholders fears that they will get a bad deal, with shorts magnifying this fear by manipulating the share price at any opportunity.I suggest that for long term income investors, this gives a great chance to build our holdings in an excellent company at a fraction of its value. Always a chance for a short squeeze, but actually I think their coverage will only get us back to a reasonable price sooner than later. I'm not very optimistic of a GME squeeze. If it moved quickly to $20, I would not sell.I expect the dividend to be raised by the 3rd Q and again next year. Might have to wait a while to $3.00 a year but I see $2.00 dividend by next year."
"RMB a year these suckers calling those $2 PT and bankruptcy on this prime A mall landord, which is now lower their debts, successfully renew the line of credit and refinance, try to improve for a better balance sheet. where are those suckers now.

The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. – Warren Buffett.
"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1019271/crowd-sourcing-a-short-squeeze ""--Among stocks that have large short interest positions, there are a number that we rate from a fundamental perspective. The only stock with a high short-interest that we currently view as undervalued is Macerich (MAC). Over the past few years, Macerich has successfully become an owner and operator of Class A regional malls. While malls may need to reposition themselves following the pandemic and become more experimental, we think the market is undervaluing the firm’s long-term prospects."""
Where is Kelly? This MAC stock is a #$%$
"our funds from operations was 59 cents per share, compared to expectation of ,44 cents, MAC had revenues of 215.5 million and estimate was 194.3 million. WE BEAT."
Dividend Day Tomorrow
"$2000 stimulus imminent with new senate. April everyone will have access to vaccine, summer is 5 months out. Think about the pyschology here, people are going to have so much pent up demand to go back to malls and socialize. This will be $20 by June."
I am expecting consolidation in the retail and mall REIT segment to continue after the Kimco and Weingarten merger. I wouldn't be surprised to see $MAC involved in some M&A themselves...
"So everyone thought rates would go up and nobody can explain why they are going down except for the argument of excess liquidity in the system. The reason value stocks are down is because investors are reading it along with a soft service demand data point that the recovery has peaked and therefore the reflationary trade has peaked. Now those looking for alpha are switching back to Tech where the lower rates won’t impede growth and where any possible threat of new variants won’t hurt them. I believe they are acting rashly and not on enough data and making a trade rather than an investment, which is why I continue to be long $JWN $MAC"
"Retail Recovery8:30 a.m. ET: Retail sales surged 5.3% in January, versus 1.1% jump expectedRetail sales rocketed higher in January following a December slide.Retail sales rose at a 5.3% monthly clip in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, following a drop of 1.0% in December. This was much faster than the 1.1% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.The jump came as sales at department stores, electronics and appliance stores, and non-store retailers reversed December declines. Department stores sales surged 23.5%, but were still down 3.0% year-over-year. Non-store retailers, a proxy for e-commerce sales, jumped 11% in January and surged by 28.7% year-over-year.Overall, retail sales were 7.4% higher than January 2020, extending a streak of year-over-year growth that began over the summer."
did anyone read the MAC reddit board? there was a poster named Jeff. He hasn’t posted for a little while but that guys posts were fire. He’s prob just watching what he predicted unfold lol.
"Let's think about this for a second...FFO for Q1 was $0.81. Just for simplicity sake, multiply that by 4, and you're in the range of $3.25 FFO. Although thinks like depreciation screw up EPS for reits, the FFO is the closest think (generally speaking) to an eps. That means the PE ratio (even after todays tiny 5% bump) is still only ~3.4. They have trimmed the dividend these past two quarters to stockpile cash. The recent dividend of $0.15 is an increase from $0.10, demonstrating they are now less concerned with cash, and want to make a fair dividend payment to their investors. While their payout ratio has dropped to around 10%, they are still paying out a dividend of 7.2%. You have got to be insane to not think this thing is going to bounce to $20 rather quickly. I do think it will take this quarterly earnings report, as well as the next, and then ppl will finally realize just how solid the footing is here. My basis is $12 and I'm saying this, but owning this one I think has by far and away the most stock price AND dividend growth potential. I almost have to hold myself back from buying up more haha."
I think I'm gonna add more shares right before the new dividend is announced. Since covid cases will probably rise after christmas and new years eve. This might cause some uncertainty about lockdowns etc. Also I don't see a whole lot of positive news coming up in the coming months except the stimulus package. Am I missing something? I'd like to hear how you guys think the share price might move in the short term.
Profit taking in recovery stocks is over. Going up again. MAC is the most undervalued stock in the whole market.
Nobody in here anymoreLooks like everyone got shaken out on black monday
"Hey everybody, squeezes are great and all that, but MAC is simply a great investment based on the fundamentals going forward. Just buy it and hold it, collect the 4% dividend, let the market do what it does (and ignore it). Years from now you will be thankful without any of the stress of whether the stock is up or down. I know that's not very exciting but that how you build wealth without gambling."
"This has bounced down from 16.85 like 10 times this week. Let’s hope it breaks through. Many near term catalysts. Delta peaking, Fed statement, run up before ER."
"Still holding since lows single digits, great stock. Buy low, sell high!"
"In Elliott Wave terms this is a correction of the entire 5 wave rally that began on November 6. The minimum target of 4th wave of lesser degree was met by this morning's decline. The maximum target would be all the way back below $7, which would still leave the bullish wave intact. Filling the large chart gap left on November 9 would require a decline to $7.37, but some gaps never get filled. Stochastics RSI is down to zero, so we are already oversold enough for the next big rally to begin."
14 more trading days until dividend declaration date for MAC - $0.20/share. Bought 165 more shares today!
"As of June 15, short % of float is 72.34%. If you put this much short interest in consideration, I think their price is relative firm even it did drop over $4 since early June high. I'm patiently waiting short squeeze to come. When it come, there are not enough shares for short seller to buy to cover. Good luck to everyone."
Wow nice beat thank you Mac management Looking realy good.Malls are back stronger then anybody thought .
"I am a SPG investor ( bought in at $65) and going to hold a long time. Came across MAC recently and want to invest. Read the Q3 ER call.With the occupancy already at 90%+ to what it was pre-covid, 1) where is the upside? I mean it can go from 92 to 100%.. is that it?2) Why is MAC so much down for the year? Sounds ridiculous.3) Looks like the dividends are definitely safe4) Cash flow are increasing and with that they can reduce the debt. But debt seems a lot (but debt is high at SPG as well.. the only thing is SPG is expanding with Taubman acquisition)What is longs' thesis on MAC going up 100-150% from here? Obviously their assets are worth a lot and are in prime location. If they want to get rid of the non-core assets, who/why should anyone buy?Liquidity is not a problem.. ok, its a problem but a short term problem, so I like to think.Many things look promising and MAC looks severely undervalued with respect to its assets and portfolio. Can someone please make a bull case for a newbie (to this stock) to invest? Thank you!"
Chart structure formed an expanded flat wave 4 correction and C wave seems to have been completed and I am hoping for wave 5 advance next but Delta variant scare may spoil the advance. Let's see what happens.
"Following earnings announcement, Morningstar reaffirms fair value estimate of $29.50, stating that the Q1 results were slightly better than they had anticipated and concluding that ""trends are all reassuring and in line with our estimate of operations slowly returning to normal."""
"MAC is just about to be priced higher than SKT, it's been a long time coming!!"
Up almost 6% today despite that hit piece being published bashing MAC. Definitely a show of strength when the stock spikes in the face of negative news coverage. Perhaps that article will even have the opposite of the intended affect. Maybe it will draw attention to MAC and the smart money who actually look at the numbers will see that it is a great investment opportunity (currently listed as the #2 most undervalued company covered by Morningstar).
Even if the dividend only eventually goes back to 2 dollars where els are you going to get an annual almost 20 percent return like that ?
MAC is down 5.08% to 17.75
"Well, Out of the top 15 owners of MAC, 13 of them added shares last quarter ending 6/30/2020. BLACKROCK INC.k added 5,953,044, these boys know what they are doing. Good luck to all Longs"
Macerich stock price target raised to $20 from $12 at Deutsche Bankhttps://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/markets/news/story.asp?docKey=1-SN20210608005568&cid=1-SN20210608005568
"The Investment Group - Ashkenazy Acquisitions which has over 12B in AUM, recently bought a 6.8% stake in MAC. This further confirms the thesis of investors that are bullish on MAC."
Today's action shows general market is rotating into safer investment options. Both SKT and SPG rose while MAC fell. This means investors consider MAC risky while SKT and SPG are safe for two reasons. 25% of MAC portfolio is in the far-left states where they can decide to flip at any time and start locking down again like European countries are doing right now if threat of infections increases further. Second is that MAC still has $500M worth of stock ready for sale at any time if management wants to do so which means possibility of further significant stock dilution. Management needs to resolve the second concern in the next ER by stating that stock selling is no long necessary unless emergency arises. Both of these concerns will be resolved only if another lockdown does not occur. Variants in general are more infectious but they are less deadly. But far-left authorities will over-react regardless as they always do. This is the biggest threat for MAC. Let's hope sufficient vaccination occurs in short time to achieve herd immunity before bad things happen again. We also do not need SPG stock pimp Reuben Brewer from MF. This guy put out at least 3 articles specifically targeting MAC for the last one month. It looks like he is pimping for SPG which he holds while getting paid by hedge fund shorters of MAC for writing articles bashing MAC with superficial knowledge.
Yesterday Morningstar reaffirmed their fair value estimate of $32.50.
"A couple things here:1) Yes Macerich only collected 26% of April rent as of their Q1 report date. Remember that this was during full closure of all stores. Since then, 20 stores are now fully opened, with another 15 now opened for limited curbside pickup. With openings happening, tenants will start repaying rent.2) On the earnings call, there was a lot of discussion about how Covid has proven that Class A brick and mortar is essential, and even retailers with a strong e-commerce platform are seeing that e-commerce has served as an incredibly weak bandage.3) Q1 earnings beat expectations, and there was YOY revenue growth as well as NOI growth. The sales per SF also broke the $900/SF mark which is much higher than Simon’s avg which is in the high $600s. 4) This Coronavirus has accelerated many things, one of which has been the separation of Class A malls in affluent areas vs. lesser malls. As we know, Macerich has trimmed its portfolio down over the past couple of years, resulting in a lower FFO. However, they dumped those properties when the market was still hot, and now they have probably the nicest/most high end portfolio in the mall world.5) Due to Covid, the last cycles’ move towards urbanization is now being reversed, and suburbanization (affluent millennials leaving the cities to move to rich suburbs) is taking place at an alarming rate. Macerich acts as the town center for these affluent suburbs.Lastly-and I know this was a long post, but they’re diversifying into office through lease deals with industrious, and their building a 550k SF office/retail flex campus for google, which is a company with one of the best balance sheets on planet earth.Just watch-they are executing impeccably, and I predict that within 6-8 months we’re back above $40 per share, and within 2-3 hrs this stock will hit all time highs."
bought a lot of options today... can't wait for 30$
"- 550 million cash on hand- 90% rent received- 90% leased- Loan Extensions on 3 properties- FFO $3.00- EPS $0.48- Beats revenue estimates for quarter- 100mill to Philadelphia fashion gives them 15% additional ownership until loan is repaid.All in all, great news! Revolving LOC will be reduced....https://last10k.com/sec-filings/mac/0001193125-21-023559.htm?utm_source=stocktwits&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=8K&utm_term=mac"
"Finally, two articles from Barron and Zack recommend MAC as value stock. This is a good start. All we need is one good news on LOC from MAC and it will shoot up. Currently, MAC is held down by second lock-down threat in far-left states where MAC has 25% of its portfolio due to new variants. Likely this will resolve in time. In the meantime, accumulate shares at good price and you will be richly rewarded in the second half of this year."
"I just noticed this stock and how undervalued it is. It owns the top shelf, platinum real estate near me. Glad I can load up on shares before the party starts."
I personally disagree with people upset about the .15 div. yes a raise would probably help with stock price short term but paying debt off would really help more if your a long term holder trying to collect divy. Get .15 now so you will get .50 next year!!! Also as far as the shorts they gone loose all there money soon!
Short term Price fluctuation without news two weeks b4 option expire means profit taking and HF trade way to make sure eating all those $18-20 prem expire on July 16.
"Why does everyone here cry when the stock they own pulls back a bit ? 1. They are not confident in the buy2. They don't have experience in how the market works A tip - Mac is a great buy right now, 91% rent collections , even if they end up losing 5% of there tenants once covid mess is done they are still a $30 stock that can pay a $1.50-2.00 div! Besides that this is America ! The great USA !! If those stores close , others will open!! One last point, look what Mac has done with Tysons Corner . That was there model for what's to come with other malls they own which are all/mostly ""A"" grade malls. Arizona mall just got approved for updates etc ... Converting parts of the mall space to residential apartments , entertainment like bowling, indoor go-Carting, indoor water parks . Etc Those are all potential takers for old big box stores. Not to mention Amazon or other fulfillment centers. NIKE CEO- said that without stores there internet sales wouldn't be half what they are, as people look, touch and feel them go home and purchase there color or size . Malls will become a Model showing for brands. I was just at Tysons corner and it blew my mind when I saw a DYSON store . Who would have thought vacuum stores were going to come back to retail ! Good luck longs! Hold your shares for $30,40 or more and collect dividends along the way!"
"Please share this message.Hello everyone,We all know the current hype on the stock market with a high rate of short selling. I'm not saying that GME and AMC are bad stocks at the moment, but there is one stock with a short float of 80% and above that looks really good fundamentally. This stock is $MAC. It's particularly distinctive and I'll save you the financial details here, but basically the market valuation is very low compared to its intrinsic value.You will thank me later. If you want to understand why fundamentally the company is worth it, please take a look at the community and you'll understand in about 5 min. https://www.reddit.com/r/MACArmyBets/"
That might have been one of the worst CC among all mall REITs that hosted earnings call this quarter!
"september 17, there are 10000 call options from now to 20' , just saying......"
I'm really missing BIG cap Zolly and his words of wisdom!
"@David, you did some calculations couple days ago about the effects of the last dilution on the SP. .... would you mind doing another calculation on the effects of another $500m dilution? Is that possible? .... The volume is too high and I fear management may be diluting again. Thanks"
"chances this getting bankruptcy is nil...if it comes to that point ...they will sell some assets to bring down the debt levels....or also raise capital once the cap markets are open...worst possible scenario is they may be bought by bpy or spg......every ones know the quality of mac malls there are one of the best and new retailers are occupying the closed shops like lucid motors , duck sports ,Peloton will be in most of the mac malls going forward ...also Dyson..these brands are doing good even in pandemic..."
Should be a much more upbeat earnings call with reopening and strong financial moves during the last quarter. Hoping to hear more confidence throughout and moving forward.
"Interesting, only one third of normal volume today. Looks like big boys are cautious and staying away from MAC."
Why is this going lower? The shorts have lots of money. There are a lot of shares left to short and they can keep piling on.This stock has been weak for a year.The entire market has a lot of air under it and the doomsayers are getting louder.People are taking profits.And people are not buying.
"Rates cannot move up substantially. The FED is trapped due to all the national debt. Inflation will probably accelerate when spendings really picks up but rates will be left untouched, which means that Macerich's real estate assets will bounce back hard. It's simple. And it's a great inflation protection."
"The one thing I don't like about today's rise in share price is that the intraday price patterns for all of the 10 most-shorted stocks among S&P 1500 (MAC is #6) are the same. That means that by and large the short covering activities are not dependent upon company specifics. The strong fundamentals of MAC relative to its valuation doesn't seem to be the main driver at all. The good thing though is that at least MAC, with its 20% gain, turns out to be the top gainer among the 10, so at a lower level its fundamentals matter. MAC's short squeeze must turn idiosyncratic (detach itself from the group) if it is to continue in the next 10 days for MAC. We won't want an exhaustion of the GME run to mean the end of MAC's run as well. And there is a way to do it.Normally I don't care about a company's dividend's policy: a dollar distributed or kept within the company means the same for me. In MAC's case, it may even be just marginally better to keep the dividend low just to be safe. But at this juncture, I think the company can trigger a real spectacular short squeeze if it strategically announces a dividend raise. It doesn't even need to be a lot. This will provide a focal point for the coordinated action of short-covering for MAC's shares and produces a squeeze, differentiating itself from the rest of the ""most-shorted"" group. Last year it wasn't until Jan 31st that MAC did the dividend announcement, and this year it looks like it will be even slightly later than that. That may be too late. But MAC can surely do it quickly if it wants to."
The bulls bought the dip! Let’s see how it closes!
price action doesn't make any sense
Read the Citi downgrade It’s all about the debt coming due and the inability to raise capital A bit doomsday but get the pointI guess they can do what Simon did and flip the keys back on a mortgage that’s not performing as these are non Recourse But I think we’d all feel better if they shored up the balance sheet soon
"High Yield Landlord, a paid subscription service on Seeking Alpha has (1) recommended MAC to its subscribers and (2) recently in August, bought shares of MAC for its own portfolio. Again - encouraging signs that committed, informed buyers are buying the stock."
So quiet lately!!!
"Almost every day lately I hear concerns about massive inflation. This will benefit MAC, as real estate is one of the best investments during times of high inflation. Conversely, bonds and growth stocks will be be hardest hit."
"Also they are not done diluting shares, keep selling at low price. Can't be good."
Sigh! Just can not win!
"For better or worse, MAC is getting pulled into the short squeeze trade along with GME, AMC and some others. Not nearly to the same degree as the others, but still. To be clear, the business behind MAC (Macerich) is in much better shape than the businesses behind GME, AMC and many of the other big short squeeze stocks. My point? Don't be in this just for the short squeeze. This is a viable economic recovery play that can be held longer term. Definitely not a pump and dump only. Good luck MAC longs!"
"V-shaped recovery in retail sales shows us that the ""retail apocalypse"" narrative is very misleading. The pandemic has not changed how people behave. We remain social beings and we want to go out to shop, dine, play, and connect with others"
"Among stocks that have large short interest positions, there are a number that we rate from a fundamental perspective. The only stock with a high short-interest that we currently view as undervalued is Macerich (MAC). Over the past few years, Macerich has successfully become an owner and operator of Class A regional malls. While malls may need to reposition themselves following the pandemic and become more experimental, we think the market is undervaluing the firm’s long-term prospects.https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1019271/crowd-sourcing-a-short-squeeze"
"Further to my comment here two days ago, we have now see Kite Realty and RPAI merge as the second one after Kimco/Weingarten in recent months...consolidation in the space is heating up. MAC will benefit."
"I bought MAC in December as an investment and thought nothing about any future short squeeze. The volatility over the past week doesn't deter my thinking and I still feel MAC is a good investment which I plan on holding for multiple years. The pandemic has shown retail it's achilleas heel and retail may never be the same as it was before, but the best retail locations (like MAC owns) will flourish again. They could even be busier than before as other lesser retail centers and locations go to the waste side. In short, the strongest retail locations will survive and prosper."
Big shorts shorted another 2M shares this morning with market orders to try to drive the price down so they can cover at cheaper prices.Time to take advantage of the shorts driving the price down at the open--- Buy more now because... MAC will likely close up for the day.Beat the shorts at their own game.
Waiting for the earnings day. I expect continued progress and hope the shorts get toasted.
"it seems that the recommendation on dividends has become outdated, and it is more likely that it is 0.15 otherwise the price would not have flown down so much. it grew solely on expectations that they would pay 0.20. the value of this share is managed exclusively by dividends. and until they start raising dividends, it will still cost a penny."
Currently in Las Vegas. No suprise the malls here are packed. Lines to shop. Waitng for my breakfest! Great stock. Hold!
Another strong report for Retail sales. MAC is a double in 2 years based on same trend after the great recession in 2009-2010.
"Funny News:1.JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut The Macerich from a ""neutral"" rating to an ""underweight"" rating and set a $12.00 price objective for the company. in a report on Monday, December 21st.2.JPMorgan Chase & Co. boosted its position in shares of The Macerich by 145.1% during the 4th quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. now owns 2,267,759 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $24,197,000 after purchasing an additional 1,342,537 shares in the last quarter"
I believe in this long term but I think it will dip this upcoming week to $16-$17. I'll look to re-buy in that range. I bought earlier this week and sold today on the run up. still holding my leaps
https://tlcvi.com/2021-mac/
1.7 million shares in the last minute to peg MAC at $13.
"Congratulation to all long who have hold. We are closing the 1st month of the year with a 50% price increase, and MAC is willing to report a positive Free cash flow on a catastrophic year for mall reit. Mall reit like MAC will take advantage of the pandemic on the long term. I would have preferred that this week rollercoaster never happened, but that’s part of the game and MAC is a volatile stock since a while.Nice weekend change your mind!"

"I'd like to thank Mike and the others who analyzed the stock situation when it was around $ 10. While there is a lot of spam on other yahoo boards, here Mike often updated even several times a day. Thanks to this, I learned many things and felt more confident buying these shares. I only have 800 shares, but I am a young investor from Central Europe and if I had more money I would definitely buy more MAC :)Thank you for your substantive conversations, I would like you to know that thanks to you, someone somewhere earned some moneyGo MAC! "
"Simon offered them $92/share and MAC has even been upgrading their portfolio since then. This is how people like Warren and other Value icons Invest--they analyze the difference between the price and underlying Value. What do you think their assets in Scottsdale, CA., MD., etc., are actually worth in this real estate market? Mall lots are becoming full of upscale housing, fitness centers, Starbucks.... GLTA."
Looks like announcement on mask in Los Angeles county due to delta variant is impeding the advance today.
"Just a poll: what's your price target for MAC in Q1 2021 and Q4 2021?For Q1 I would like to see 12 USD (and of course more) and by year-end 2021, 24 USD."
"CA was only open for what, two weeks this quarter? I don’t expect earnings to blow it out of the park, but I’m looking forward to the guidance."
Instead of raising of dividend. I rather prefer mac has stronger balance sheet and lower the debt. Generate a bigger income instead. So this company can at least go back to half of 2015 sp lvl.
"Simon and now Tanger have both raised their dividend. MAC is next, and I don't think it will be a half cent like Tanger."
Best 5 year dividend stock.
Will keep trading sideways until earnings or any company update on collections and activity. Still is forming a strong base before the big jump. Cannot stay this low forever! I build my 10k position so now I will sit on it until it goes at the minimum to the roaring 20’s.
It sounds like the line of credit issue is close to resolution. Chapter 11 or stock dilution is not on the table. The stock will fly on the news!
"How do you retire on $180,000 savings? Buy 20,000 shares of MAC and get $60,000 annual dividend after pandemic is over."
"I'm planning on being a long holder here when I purchased my shares this past December. I'm sure a lot of people are probably disappointed that MAC didn't hold it's gain from early last week, but MAC is up more than 30% from a month ago and it feels like we might have found the floor at about $14If we hold this price for a day or two, I would expect it to move up from there. I don't believe it will be a rapid rise, but a more gradual one as the vaccine gets distributed and we get into Spring. I'm not saying a short squeeze can't happen, but I think it's less likely now that we see what the brokerage houses will do when it sees all the retail purchases coming in against a large short position.For people who purchased at a higher point, you have a few choices. Sell for a loss and move on (not a great choice in my opinion, but each Investor has their own particular goals), hold and wait for the price to go back up (which I believe it will over the rest of 2021), or buy some additional shares and average down (I've done this strategy with two Energy stocks that took huge hits on back in March of last year and it's worked out well for me). Remember that Investing should be logical. Very few good decisions are made when you get emotional when investing. Good luck to all...."
"This is the part of earnings call that concerns me and would like to hear your thoughts about. It’s clear management will issue more stock this year so the big question is if it would be enough to actually cap the price this year. Thoughts??Management was asked to explain why they already went over the $700m ATM assumed for this year from the last presentation and he basically says that was for display purposes and that they will issue this year dependent on stock price. “Caitlin, that was a generic placeholder in a three-year forecast that Scott was using to illustrate deleveraging. So that was not a hardwired assumption. We've been really fairly active on the ATM, so it's going to be dependent upon the share price, whether we use it again this year or not. It remains to be seen whether we'll do equity again in 2022.” - Management"
"Despite lock down measures expanding, most of the epicenter stocks including MAC are holding ground. Looks like market is waiting for vaccine approval. Two weeks to go."
"I've been to two Macerich properties over the past month or so, Broadway Plaza (Northern California) & The Oaks (Southern California). The sample size is small, but the narrative that the mall is dead is far from true. Both were bustling with business with the restaurants packed with happy eaters. Interested to hear what people are seeing at other Class A Malls across the country. Zero interest in lower quality malls that are indeed dying."
"Deptford Mall was really busy yesterday, lots of people in the mall, the Round 1 , the food court"
"I know MAC has tons of debts, but I also want to see my divvies go up. Anyone knows when they gonna increase the divvies?"
