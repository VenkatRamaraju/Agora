$200 for the weekend my most beautiful mistress ?;)$
"""With Cloudflare’s Workers platform, we hope to empower the next billion dollar enterprise to be built entirely on Cloudflare,"" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. ""Whether you are an individual developer, a small business, or large enterprise, it’s truly powerful to build apps that can solve real-world problems and can run in seconds, globally, all with less code and faster."""
"Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Cloudflare. The Cloud Warriors."
"NET has the very possibility of being a 1k a share stock. Stock up, babies!"
Thank you so much. NET
2 options. 1) insider trading on knowledge of earnings or 2) massive pump n dump operation.
"At one point should we sell? I'm in since 18$, it's been an awesome ride and trying to figure out if the earnings are gonna meet the expectation of this SP "
Cloudflare is up 6.38% to 195.79
It is official!! Made 1 million dollars on NET holding!!!
"Cloudflare is valuation insanity. Just think, if Amazon also traded at 100x revenue, it would be worth more than the entire Nasdaq market.I remember when 100X PE was considered stratospheric."
"That's very interesting Benjo. So you were long on this stock for months and months, consistently raising your ""price targets"" as if you were an analyst. Suddenly, a few weeks ago you sold all your stake at around $120.00 and began bad mouthing the company. Did you know it was a fraud when you were long and the stock or did you find out suddenly? Tell us what the fraud involved and how you discovered it."
"Cloudflare currently has P/S = 96 using high end of this years predicted sales. And it's still trading at a P/S = 69 using high end of next years predicted sales. For reference, the industry average is P/S of 24. Great company but too expensive right now."
so twilio beats earnings estimates and drops 5% after hours? beats aren't enough right now... it's all priced in
"Those are the three things that differentiate Cloudflare from everybody else that's out there. I think the company has a strong competitive position, and that takes us into what's its market opportunity. Back in 2018, the company was primarily focused on application services. This is the content delivery I have been talking about. Then they release their zero trust solution, Cloudflare for Teams. And Cloudflare One, which is their network services. So, you can see that's shown over on the right-hand side here, and you can see that that has really boosted their market opportunity, so from $32 billion in 2018, the company expects that to reach $100 billion in 2024."
This is total manipulation with the help from insiders. No one will buy a company trading at 130+ revenue. All is done with insider information. A 600 employee company with $61Billion market cap !
"do you see this one? any thought?Jefferies boosted the price target for Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET) from $135 to $195but Jefferies cut to hold from buy."
"Like many here, I'm baffled as well. Their revenue is not even growing that much, and PS is out of whack, why is this stock go up this much every single day? Does anyone have any rational reason? I was actually an investor at 40 and I admit I sold way too early around $110, now I'm just baffled..."
Was just reading about how this is THE most overvalued Company atm.
I remember when TEAM was at 60B market cap and people were shorting the hell out of it! Seing the same patterns here lol !
"Benjo, Benjo, Benjo. According to his posts, he sold all of his stake at about $120 and then he shorted with ""both hands."" I don't think that he's all that qualified to be giving investment advice on this stock."
