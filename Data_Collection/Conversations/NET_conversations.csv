"It will be at $200 in 3 yrs, similar path as TWLO, HUBS, etc etc. Very good company with a very good product(s)"
not sure more debt is good. they need the money?
if up a lot of short will lose a lot. They scare people away
I'd buy some shares at $15.
Q2 financials are out. full press release here https://cloudflare.net/news/news-details/2021/Cloudflare-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx
If only FSLY bag holders bought $NET instead…
Yeah its run up so much no matter what earnings are will just fall
Does anybody have a sense of why the stock price crashed yesterday?
NET had been staying above 116 since the last week of July hitting the mid 120's this month. If this continues to hold the next push will be in the 130's to the 140's next month. As this company continues to grow and its earnings starts to turn positive don't be surprised if the price will hit the 200's by the end of this year or the first quarter of next year. Like they say that most successful companies are expensive for a reason and I think that NET is one of those stocks. That has been proven time and time again and will be the same in the future. NET has very little debt and fundamentals remains strong so as long as they continue to innovate and deliver the sky is the limit for any stock that can do that including NET. Have a nice weekend and stay safe as always.
Remember CEO said firing on all cylinders last report!!!!
"Im in this at 75 but valuation is getting kinda stretched here. I mean I love the business and what the company does, that's why I invested in it in the first place but at $33B on $615M in forecasted revenue this year and no earnings is a bit too much. If you guys like high growth names like NET, Id suggest you look at UPST as well, an artificial intelligence for lending company that IPO'd 6 months ago and that's already up 200% YTD, that has a $9B cap with 157% growth YoY on in revenue to 600M and EPS of jumping 169% YoY to 0.62$. Good luck to all!"
"Recently invested here for several reasons, one being the growth potential. So I just went to Cloudflare's website and counted 205 job openings. These positions were Worldwide: USA/Singapore/UK/Portugal/Japan/Germany/Australia/China/CanadaI read a lot of negative comments on message boards, mostly they are just opinions, some from disgruntled investors, others from shorts. All I know is this company is growing and that will ultimately translate into shareholder wealth. If your here for a short term trade, I wish you luck, but the future for Cloudflare is very positive. I know why I'm invested here."
"Really tempted to start selling my long term shares. I did this last month when NET spiked on speculation just before earnings and that worked out well. It is really tough not to be greedy and take tremendous profits today, thinking NET is in ""over bought"" territory and the speculators are running wild in the street buying at any price. On the other hand, I'm convince that NET's market cap will be $100B in 5 years so I'm trying to resist selling long term shares today and this is remarkably hard to do."
"NET will selloff not just because of Fastly, but because its valuation is too high right now and it's overdue for a small correction. Long term, this stock will do very well, but if you need profits short-term, definitely consider selling some."
Guidance uncertain otherwise good earnings
NET to $127 tomorrow!
Great call on the downgrade. Must have been a Tom Lee call.
"Noce net. My 3rd biggest profit stock after tesla and lac. No doubt it’s 10 bagger, It’s just matter of time.. peace "
Stock price is getting dangerous
"Wait...33 billion market cap and 600 million annual revenue...ohhh, got it"
Growth is slowing big time only - overvalued !!! Sell Sell Sell
the only stock in my profile is growing this big.
"Wait a minute, this stock can have down days? No one told me this stock could have down days!"
Congrats to longs
thank NET.Please go up
This stock is holding up strong during these last few days of overall market selling.
Bought some more. This is a 2000's CISCO pump and it's far from over. When people fear a crash. You BUY!
Im buying more on the dip
"Some selling NET aftermarket due to bad results from FSLY ? May be overreacted, they are 2 different players……"
"Very strong , adding more"
how does this trade at 70X sales..
"People who make the $FSLY and $NET comparison time and time again fail to understand that these are two fundamentally different companies; starting with products, the revenue models, and all the way up to leadership (Prince and Zatlyn!). Cloudflare is going to fundamentally become a part of internet infrastructure while Fastly is just a CDN. I feel extremely confident holding $NET for the next 10 years and will buy any dip."
"Insanely speculative stock, huge blowout is coming in august."
A nice green hammer is what I think we see
A little dip on Friday but not to worry as $150.00 most likely in the pipeline by end of this year.
https://securityboulevard.com/2021/08/cloudflare-vulnerability-enabled-compromise-of-12-of-all-websites/Cloudflare recently disclosed a vulnerability that could have resulted in successful cyberattacks on the millions of websites (12.7% of ALL websites to be precise)
Been here since 35$
"Hello clueless bank analysts- this company is v good and the price will go up high post report , this is not fastly"
CRWD just gave a strong report at the close yesterday and that bodes well for all cloud companies including NET. Hope you have a good day.
65X Sales: do any of you understand what higher rates will do to this stock? Forget about the quality of the business thee are that’s secondary. Rates are going up and several of the tech stocks are starting to feel the pain. Once momentum loses up NET is going to get decimated.
Valuation is 60X 2021 revenue guidance. Yikes.
Is it out?
"The best stock ever , we will reach $300 easy this decade"
Cloudflare is down 5.85% to 118.13
Wow this dip is so terrifying. 
They have bigger revenue with bigger loss . It should go below $100 .
"Predictions on price targets updates tomorrow? I think most will maintain buys, though doubt many price target increases."
Shorts where are you at?
Strong companyBut just a little far to fast on the SP
Nuthin’ but $NET
"bought in at 39, and this stock exploded. The growth was too quick for what they’ve been putting out. This pullback is normal and healthy, so buy the dip."
What is cool about a new high is that everybody who owns shares of this stock has profited.
"Its good, good company and quarter.Just it is insanely over valued at 60x Revs. It can't go up because of valuationWould you pay $4M for a Lambo Huracan, when you can get a Ferrari for $350k??"
DDOG did 67% yoy and trades 50x sales vs NET at 53% yoy and 65x sales. Everyone knew what happened on DDOG
Seeing bearish reversal. Could break $92 this week
Baird Downgrades Cloudflare to Neutral
Nice attack from cloudflare to AWS. Let's see how it plays out.
Like I said before this is the best. I started around $54
Is it $125 today ?
And how much money does this company make….Let me check….Oh ya…NOTHING!!!
"I have made the following performance summary for NET vs FSLY:Q2 Rev: NET - $99.7M FSLY- $75M Ratio- 1.33Q2 GM: NET- 76.8% FSLY- 61.7% Ratio- 1.24Q3 FCST: NET- $102.5-$103.5M FSLY-$73.5-$75.5M Ratio- 1.37-1.412020 Guidance: NET-$404-408M FSLY-$290-$300M Ratio:1.36-1.4Risk Exposed: NET- None. FSLY- Yes, TikTok(12% of Revenue)Market Cap B4 earning: NET- $12.56B FSLY- $11.24BMarket Cap After earning: NET-?? FSLY- $9.25B(18% correction)From the above summary, very clear FSLY major drops has two reasons, 1. TikTok risk that constitute to 12% of Revenue. 2. Flat growth for Q3.To fairly assess what is the fair valuation for NET, first we need to know the differences between NET and FSLY.1. NET does not exposed to the TikTok risk, and from the earning call mentions by CEO, the full risk to China customers is minimal.2. NET is 36-40% larger company than FSLY, with gross margin is 1.24 of FSLY. NET also has a much larger customers based.3. Before the earning call let put into perspective, NET already been undervalued compare to FSLY, therefore, the argument that NET already price in is baseless.After the earning call, so what should be the proper valuation? I assume that FSLY price before earning call is already price in, assuming no risk due to TikTok and will show Q/Q growth results. I use FSLY market cap as a based valuation, $11.24B. As NET Revenue is 1.36-1.4 times of FSLY, so assuming same Gross margin, the valuation of NET should be at $15.3B, which is Stock price of $50.3. However, the NET Gross Margin is 1.24 of FSLY, so max stock price should be $62.4. In Summary, the fair price for NET after earning call should be in the range of $50-$63."
RememberThere is no NET to catch you if this falls
Same reaction as overpriced SHOP. These supposed value companies aren't allowed to have a real earnings drop.
I'd say stable earnings - from quarter to quarter 10% growth. But no improvement on profitability :(
"Not enough growth, 50% haircut, minimum."
"Pushing hard towards a new all-time high ($132.09) in a choppy market today. Maybe we get there today, or maybe not -- but this company appears to be well-positioned for future growth. Check out the recent 5 minute Motley Fool video to get a summary of what NET offers."
If you are questioning NET'S debt of 448m you should not because that is very little compared to its enterprise value of 36b and market cap of 38b and growing. A lot of companies big or small have more than that and yet nobody is questioning them. So far most tech companies have little or no debt. NET's fundamentals remains strong and as they continue to grow their company that it will be just a matter of time that their earnings will soon be positive. Have a nice day and stay safe everyone.
NET price target raised to $140 from 105 by Needham
$150 by end of yeart is getting closer than ever.
Is it still a buy??
No change in fundamentals and story. I hope you continue to take advantage of down days. Today is a good day for NET for being green on a red day. Way to go NET and you deserve it. Have a nice day everyone and stay safe as always.
WOW NET
Love NET
Was $100 a good entry point for this stock?
"On a technical basis this stock is positioned extremely well since it just broke out to a new ATH but fundamentally it is still way overpriced even based on 2024 numbers, I mean it is still trading at 30x 2024 revenue and no profits until at least 2023-2024."
NET has made me very rich. Holding and adding since 20+-40s........cheers! Just dropping in to say high. It is a good company. Holding strong for the future. Just like atlassian
This is what I get for being a bear haha I prefer call options but how has this not dropped like a rock back down to $100 yet? Will hold these Puts until 9/17 expiration though. Still confident it will drop significantly more over the course of the next 2 months tho. Who in their right mind is buying at this absurd valuation?!?!?!
"This beast just keep growing, such a beautiful chart! where do you guys see the SP in 5 years?"
110 is coming baybeeeee
In at $117

$36 here. These guys are going to have a monopoly like status in 3-5 years. $400+ not out of the question.
always funny seeing the bears come out after beating earnings. please sell so i can continue buying
What happen?
"I've been holding NET since April 2020. Great company, great outlook, innovative products but at this point valuation seems pricey. I sold out of my position but will keep an eye out if it drops to the 90's again."
"""Based on current margin and expenses, they now require ""$81,250,000 in quarterly revenue to breakeven !!!""Alias @J you come on newly on this board thinking your going to bring back DEATH to stardom ??? Your free to DREAM and your free to pump DEATH. Now ask yourself how many years has Meni Morim been CEO ? Now ask your self, under his direction when was the last time you seen an intriguing lump some of $NET $REVENUE posted VIA a Quarterly Report News Wire ?"
Shorts are running scared!
"For those who refuse to compare this to FSLY, they are in the same EXACT business and have very similar rev. No reason whatsoever for this to be priced 10x FSLY."
I’m up 235% should I trim?
Sold Half today.
Barely down to 57X guidance haha this has a long way too fall. I will close my short position once this is at 50X guidance ($100). That is if rates don't start rising. If 10yr gets up to 1.5% I will close this out at 40X guidance ($80). YoY growth is slowing and will decline to 40s next quarter and 30s next year.
Congrats longs we reached a new high today!!!
Do we buy at these levels
Reiterate. $150 by end of year.
1billion in the bank and 435 million debt! This company is set up for the future! In at $32 and feeling really good!
Looks like it'll retest the 30's.
I'm in at 39.70
"Better scoop it up before it gets back to $8 folks, This is a gift for holding the stock for 4 years for pretty much nothing, actually a a bath with no water.."
"$NET is the new MSFT or NVDA, GET IN https://marketdeepview.com/2021/09/03/cloudflare-net-stock-keeps-on-promising-by-reaching-new-highs/"
Not selling till NET gets to at least $200.00
Great quarter and the stock tanks? Ridiculous- will be up $15 tomorrow
NET is definitely a stock to own. It should be worth much more than $300 in a few years. Very bullish on this one https://marketdeepview.com/2021/09/03/cloudflare-net-stock-keeps-on-promising-by-reaching-new-highs/
Bubble bursting ?
4 digit stock within 5 years
Needham has upped price target to 140.
Need to wait for the call. This is great company.
when the market corrects this is doomed. overvalued
Haircut coming.
"F those that are selling. When everyone yells crash. You BUY, simple trading.If you don't get it. You shouldn't be trading."
Huge buy zone right now. 1 billion loan into the business. Wouldn’t get one without huge upside for investors. 175-190 in 6 months is a strong possibility.
"wow wow,Love the management of NET"
Never selling !! Take some pain for future gains like we have been doing for the last 3 years!
Cloudflare stock will just not stop rising in the near future https://marketdeepview.com/2021/08/05/cloudflare-stock-keeps-on-rising/
Should have a nice run up towards earnings on Aug 5th. Product announcements also pending on last week of July!
Joke of 2020 - pumpers tried to bid $FSLY higher than the real winner Cloudflare $NETLMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Here we go. Going sub $100. Knew I should have sold my growth stocks
Here we go $111.1 nothing beats Cloudflare
Stock acts great... stay with it.
Rumours NET-sites got hacked.
"FSLY max was about 136 and then a long way down, looks like NET is going to repeat the FSLY path."
Based on other cloud computing & cyber security valuations and their YoY growth %s this should have a P/S ratio around 40x guidance. That would give NET a valuation in the range of 25 billion in current market conditions. If any sort of valuation correction happens in the high-growth tech space this could go to 15 -20 billion market cap.
Come on Net. Tomorrow is your day to show why your valuation is 7X Fastly's.
We all knew this sell off was coming. Hopefully all took their profits and buy back at lower entry. GLTA.
"Valuation makes no sense for me now, sold 95% of my holdings in Net, hope it comes down so I can buy more"
The market isn’t liking the earnings report. We are down big in after hours.
Net and fsly have similar revenue and net loss chart . Then why net is up and fsly down ?
Both SNOW and CRM cloud stocks just reported strong earnings and guidance at the close today should bode well for cloud stocks including NET. Have a good night everyone.
I repeat. $150 by end of year or might be earlier.
please close green
"I just bought 49,000 shares a just over $6"
Just a healthy pullback
Yawn… talk to me in a few weeks when the stock price is back to ATHa
Huge volume out of the gate! Giddy up
selling CRWD and buying NET was really worth it watch it at $160 q2/22
Next earnings will put this one into reality check
Just as expected. Drop on earnings
"I know there's more to analyze a stock than the following, but you can see Cloudflare being used EVERYWHERE. How many websites have you gone on that show the Cloudflare screen first?"
if close green today shorties will be afraid on next strongest quarter. I believe that is the DDOG strategy. Jumped up a lot. Today down little.
this is good. even better. will up more
Upgraded to $52!
what is a good price to get in?
"If you are going to long, wait until the high volume sell off ends."
Will this move like crwd?
$113 and dropping.
Overvauled sadly heading back to 100. Don't know if i should sell or not
Always so nice when there is a sizeable drop and NO news. Big funds have the info FIRST. But that's fair........NOT.
Tomorrow down sure .
"If they forecast 166M$ next quarter and 630m$ for the full year, then it means for Q4 they expect 175m$."
Looks like the same people who were pumping up FSLY last year are pumping up NET now. Overvalued and the growth is slowing down
"Let this sink in!According to a report published by CEPro, the cybersecurity market is expected to be valued at $403 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 12.5%. The U.S. is home to some of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world, including Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE: PANW), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET), Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZS), Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ: FTNT), etc. These companies provide services to several organizations in the country and internationally. Considering the recent waves of cyber hacks, the call for cybersecurity companies, in private and governmental enterprises, is going to rise. For example, recently, Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ: FTNT) announced its contract with the U.S. Army as a manufacturer of IT solutions.Hopefully most can see the almost half a trillion number!"
I have a lot of shares from mid 30. I'm thinking about not selling
"But it a $6 bucks now, sell it for $8 in a couple of weeks when we get through this nasty September."
What is going to happen on earnings if they dont make it?
"How can a stock that loses $120m a year on $440m of revenute, be valued so highly? I'm not trolling, i'm just trying to understand, please respond ..."
Where all my shorts at?  I think the stock will continue to have a good run up till earnings
"Retail armchair traders are so bearish on growth companies. They always parrot this line:X amount of revenue but no earnings!!! Like, guys, read up on how growth stage companies operate. Making a profit is explicitly avoided in order to skip taxes and instead invest everything in growth."
"I am a huge NET bull, but who would buy this thing at these valuations, 60x Revs. APPS is better and trades at like 8x Revs.Small caps are insanely cheap right now"
Best stock on the market
Already in big debt and now another $1B loan . What is right valuation of this stock ?
"No change in story for NET. Still innovating and collaborating with well known established companies. For those who wants to expand their shares into the stock, you can always take advantage of days like days before it joins the coveted triple digit membership like its peers. This company is deserving of that because of its important products and services that is transforming our world as we speak and it won't be long before it reaches that landmark. Have a nice day everyone."
Cloudflare is just exceptional! Unfortunately I didnt load up enough when it was at $65 https://marketdeepview.com/2021/08/05/cloudflare-net-stock-keeps-on-rising/
My target remains $150. Planning to raise to $170.
#$%$ jsut happened???
Puts printing tomorrow
We’re earnings that bad?
"From Q2 Press Release“We had our strongest quarter ever as a public company, and our revenue growth continued to accelerate, growing 53% year-over-year. We also added a record number of large customers, signing the equivalent of more than two six-figure customers every single business day in Q2.” said Matthew Prince, co-founder & CEO of Cloudflare. “Whether we’re offering Zero Trust security solutions to the world’s most sophisticated organizations, or enabling the next billion dollar business with Cloudflare Workers, we remain focused on delivering secure, programmable network solutions that our customers rely on.”"
Do you guys recommend shaving off some profit to balance out the portfolio or riding the wave long term? I’m in at 36.
DDOG jumped from 115 to 135 yesterday. Today down to 130
The rumours of $NETS demise have have been greatly exaggerated.
"Flunctuations are expected. However, dont look so short term. Hold for the next 3-5 years. You will be rewarded"
"where once $NET used to break down in red market days, now it tends to be a leader."
People looking for a haircut should look elsewhere
"Did u guys know that Tesla just became profitable last year? Literally lost money for 15 yrs straight. It’s not all about fundamentals. You’re betting on the future. Cloudflare is never gonna get bought out. Anyone thinking that has no idea what they’re saying. They will be the most powerful cyber security company in the world, by a mile. If you don’t think that alone is worth a couple hundred bucks a share, I don’t know what rock you’re living under."
there is not a single financial metric to support $130. this will be the falls best short opportunity.
"CTRX, PINS, examples of what happens when you don't just meet expectations."
"This stock has gone from expensive to luxury , and now price is just out of wack. I can’t imagine this thing can hold its price during correction. 50% hair cut for sure"
Way to go NET and you deserve it. Volume maybe lower than average but most of them are people buying in to the stock. No change in story or fundamentals remains a growth stock with strong management and very little debt. Have a good weekend and stay safe as always.
This was $19 in January 2020 what makes it $130 now? oh right fake pumps
Told you. That was our dip. Only up from here. WE don't know how to sell!
"geez, this level is making me feeling really nervous !"
"Don’t panic sell, and don’t panic buy. Take a walk, and enjoy the fresh air knowing this stock will generate gains for years to come whether it dips or gains in the short term."
"Congrats again to all longs! Cloudflare, the gift that keeps on giving."
"Nice job on a selloff like that, investors believe in NET vision, THE cloud edge all product."
when everyone is crying it is time to load
WOW NEW ATH! Congrats to all shareholders who have made a profit. Even those who bought today.
AMC to the moooonnnnn
"I'm an investor, not a trader. I understand that most here are traders. Trade away. Bought my shares back in the mid $50's range. Just holding. Y'all trade to your heart's content. It goes up, it goes down, it doesn't matter because this is one of several stocks that I just hold."
Best tech stock there is
Ah I see what's a bit significant here - they raised full year revenue 5% but at the same time raised net loss 5% for the year.
"Cloudflare analytics is already better than Google Analytics, since it's not affected by adblockers. The product is not a money maker on it's own though.I'm excited for cloudflare's future. Just check out their blog where they share a loot it info about their products!"
The results are good. Anyone selling is taking profits at this point. All good baby. 
DDOG another cloud company gave a strong earnings report yesterday is also down today probably because most of the cloud stocks are down and so with most of the tech sector is down. The history of tech earnings had been mostly strong that is why a lot of them are very successful in growing their businesses. Today maybe a red day but tomorrow will be another day. Have a nice weekend and stay free and safe as always.
I'm still here..... Since 27.5
"For those of us who work in the IT industry, we know this company's technology is parallel to CF's technology. They have become central to many IT organizations and can jack up their prices and customers will pay!! It is also a acquisition target. Google, Amazon, etc will fight to buy this company.Problem is : valuation is too high. This is why I think any weakness will be met with buying.Long term very bullishShort term , who knows, may melt up with the rest of the market!"
"revs cant be manipulated, earnings can be."
valuation is insane now
I was predicting $100 by end of year and NET reached that much faster than anticipated. $128 by end year is not very likely or it might reach that after earning report early next month.
do not sell now. Look at fsly.. you will lose a lot
"I love when you rookies say ""200 coming end of month"" ""300 end of year"" hey let's all make fake imaginary prices and get wrecked."
I think we hit the bottom. this is gonna explode tomorrow.
"NET is in the early stages of high growth. It’s cloud based end point security will be a primary way to manage on line data storage and security. NET has a big lead on any other, including the big 3 in this furture."
I guess only shorts are buying now. I doubt there are much new money coming in considering upcoming tapering. When real yields rise - unprofitable expensive companies will be hurt first.
P/s=72. Wow. What a fall down is coming :)
"Patience patience patience. No change in story or fundamentals remains an important company with strong management. Most cloud and tech companies are down for no reason. This too will pass like any day in the past 100 years. I just hope that days like this for those that want to add to their shares or be a part of one of the best companies that are transforming our world today and the future take advantage of these red days. NET remains a strong buy, have a nice day and stay safe as always."
Fastly earnings pulling this one down AH
It is not too late to buy NET because it will be a will be a 300+ stock by 2022 and don't be left out. Don't be misled by analysts like Motley Fool because that is who they are to fool you. Just go with the company's fundamentals which is still strong and you will be fine. Have a nice day and stay safe everyone.
Turn a profit and I'm a buyer at $26........word.
"The Market makers will step in soon and the small time reddit pumpers will be wiped out. Sell, sell, sellInsanely overvalued."
This is a $150 stock by end of year if not more.
I've got nothing better to do than make a ton of money with CLMT on my leash.
"I added more shares @116. we couldn't have asked for a better reaction after earnings. This company is STRONGER than Fastly, and investors like Management's ability to accurately forecast."
net nothing to do with fsly. net is cyber sec play.
Story and fundamentals remains intact so I hope you are taking advantage of times like these to add to your account. Have a nice day and stay safe as always.
"will sell off 100% , way high priced ."
Do y’all think it’s still a good time to buy or wait till it comes down a bit ?
NET did well the past four quarters and I think they will do well next week when they report their earnings. As investors patience is always important specially if the confidence is being questioned by others. Have a blessed day everyone and stay safe as always.
When the market crashes. The highest forward multiples will crash the hardest. Sell while you can
Fossil fuel rocks. I buy anything starting with specialty.
"I said $150 by end of this year is coming, In addition $200 by June 2022."
"Why the drop? Deposited today, still waiting for the funds to arrive in my brokerage account. Buying the dip."
This is future. This can hit $200-250 before retreating.
All time high today I’m guessing 
60x PS Down 50% still higher than lots of top growth stocks
Primed for a 50% haircut.
My target remains 135 and raising to 149.
"~150M in revenue this quarter, projecting 160M next quarter - not impressive, valuation is insane"
Beat on revenues and net earnings (loss); projected Q4 revenues above consensus estimates and net earnings (loss) higher than estimates. What's not to like in the ER? Buy more ...
Officially a triple bagger for me. Cloudflare in my stock portfolio hall of fame
just want expected. No surprise please
"Now that the Chinese government is tightening the grip on the Chinese technology company, more institutions start to change their holding and buying to U.S. technology stocks. NET will surely continue to fire up to the end of year at the least. $150 by end of this year in my opinion.I was predicting $120 last 2 weeks by end of year but now with contract from government. The sky is the limit!"
Up 62% and considering trimming to take some profits but loving this run up.
"Just sold 1/3, taking the profits to invest elsewhere and leaving the free money to sit here. GLTA"
Quick check in with all my Bullish friends & quick reminder to not forget why u invested in Net. It doesent matter that the stock is falling. It's a pull back from a great run.It is the market & all it does is postpone your gains for a few weeks. The sky is not falling & it shall recover to greater heights.Wealth is earned but Health is a blessing.If it drops to 30 but is at 60 in december does it really matter? Nope!
hello. The best quarter ... big guys are in... give them the chance
We is selling before earnings?
if shorties get this time NET will suffer every time on strongest quarters. this depends on how the big holders think.
https://discord.gg/FnNWvpq
I hate myself for selling this at 96.00 :(
"I am sure Google , Amazon or CISCO are drooling to buy this company. They are far ahead of everyone else"
Lot of volume and only down 2-3% is a good sign. I’m a buyer at $120
Alright this thing is so so overvaluedI know it’s in an industry that is growingBut reality please
Earnings are on Thursday? I am waiting. Got so many calls over 130.
Down 10% today watch
Congratulations for another strong report with the revenue continuing to climb and earnings a penny above the estimate. Will let them digest the report and have management finish the earnings call and hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. Have a good night everyone.

"The big guys are going to drop this one hard, the only question is when. Probably the end of the year - could be sooner who knows…"
She's breaking out higher! GL Longs!
"I’m working in the cloud and I had the chance to compare a lot of waf providers. Cloudflare is my favorite, they have great features, using machine learning for the security, best design and their team is highly skilled and proactive. I hope it can help people to lead their decision on this one. Again not working for them, really just had the chance to use their product."
"Can't turn a profit, gotta give it a hair cut, figuring 50%, probably more.Word."
Been holding since the $30s and adding periodically to my position since.Won’t be selling a share for a long time
See Palo Alto earnings blowout. A high tide rises all boats.
Just reached another new high today at 132.46 way to go NET. More to come. Have a blessed day everyone.
I am not long or short. Why is this going down? What happened in the earnings report?
$130 easy after earnings
Just recommended by Motley Fool
The same bears would’ve said this about AMZN back in 1990s lol
"This stock doesn’t go down anymore, does it?"
A cloudflare DNS server just went down. It’s about to have a moment similar to that which Fastly endured earlier this year.
Any news today?
NET is a young company with great vision and very little debt. I hope you are taking advantage of these red days. Stay safe everyone.
Cloudflare rules the internet. It’s everywhere.
These next two weeks will be rocket fuel for the stock. Many product announcements coming up and earnings release!
Will there be a sell off?
12345 to the moon and way beyond $$$
"Guys amazing company but the valuation is getting lofty. I wouldn’t be surprised by a significant pullback after earnings. Long term no problem, but just expect some volatility in the next while. Good luck to all!"
What happened
"Just my 2-cents here but I think that NET will have revenue come in at $149-$150 mln on thursday, earnings at -.02. The trend has been revenue growth at 8-10% qtr-over-qtr for the past 3-4 qtrs and, if anything, growth momentum is on their side. Someone on this board mentioned profitability not before 2023-2024, but I'm looking for profit by 2nd qtr. 2022. Hoping, anyway."
What going on up 6%
Shorts are devastated that $NET is only 4% from ATH . Stay steady longs this rocket ship ain’t stopping anytime soon
NET holders - prepare to be FASTlied in august or PINSed :)
"Hmmm. This $1.160 bln. private placement of convertible securities, if I did the math correctly, will be dilutive to shareholders to the tune of 6.1 million shares when the stock price reaches $190/sh. Looking for comments and opinions here because if the share price hits $190/sh, am I supposed to be upset by an additional 6.1 million shares?"
"Can any expert tell how down it will fall tomorrow , please ? I guess $105"
How do we feel about earnings?
Just don’t move sideways tomorrow and I’ll be good
I wanna play calls but then the volume is spread is horrible
Buy before it hits 150 !!
I hope they are not comparing NET to FSLY because even if they are both cloud companies NET had been doing well with their earnings the past four quarters while FSLY missed two of its earnings the past four quarters and today they reported another miss earnings. Product wise NET is doing well with their products and are gaining a lot of client. I won't be surprised if NET will give another strong report after the market closes tomorrow. Have a good night for tomorrow is a new day.
earnings in one hours. hopefully it's strong
At least $300 soon
