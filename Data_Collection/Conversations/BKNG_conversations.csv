BKNG is ready for next run: buy any weakness:Target $2800
No Booking comments recently? I guess the shorts got their nose broke and left town. This isn’t a stock to short.
down ahead of ER due out on november 3rd?
"just the beginning, no guidance from Booking for this year and probably reduced significantly for next year too. still overvalued"
You guys need to realize that so many traditional travel agencies actually went bankrupt. Bookings will gain substantial market share.
"I am short 60 shares at 1910 down 12 grand now ? how much higher can this go , is there a justification for a price this high"
Booking is up 4.99% to 2244.04
this week will end at $2600
Next stop: 2800
Why the drop?
Its certainly a whole lot easier to travel within the US vs. traveling outside the US. Traveling to Canada and this Covid testing sure isnt as simple as it should be. The frustration is both leaving the US entering Canada and then returning home.
"Price today is higher then before Covid.... The company makes revenue from booking travel and hotels... Hotels are going bankrupt left and right, revenue is falling at each and every hotel. Banks are not even extending credit to hotels or any travel business. Yet, investors drive a travel stock to new highs expecting the best case scenario and betting on a recovery so quick that we will be back to higher than 2019 levels in how many years ? if this is not the irrational looking you in the face, I have no idea what is."
I would look out for BKNG> They are upsetting many of their customers thru their subdivision Priceline. The charge a booking fee for cruises and when the Cruise lines canceled their sailings Priceline will not refund the booking fee. It is not a large fee $25 but it is making customers mad that they are adding insult to injury of not being to travel as they planned.
"Share price has gotten way ahead of itself. No one will book anything before the China virus spread is tamped down. A small reflection of normalcy will not occur until at least the autumn of 2021. Air travel, cruises, entertainment will not recover pre covid level for at least several years."
Booking.yeah goes up on a terrible day for the market!
Market cap lower than ABNB?! Should be much higher!
"As a long term holder, they always guide conservatively every quarter: beat_repeat, beat_repeat, beat_repeat"
Even with Earnings miss it still seems like the street liked it. We are up after hours quite a bit! Also watching this other one while we see how the street digests this one. https://alldaytrading.market/FeaturedstockPick
Not even for $1500! So over valued!!!
"Personal thinking of my own, so please do take offence if you think I am wrong. I think today shows how public react to just a slightest news can affect the market. So I think during market crash, it is alot about investors confidence rather than how much a stock should be trading at and how the earning report is like. Of course, earning report is important as well for the basis of investing in a company which allow you to know how long a company can last in bad times. But it is important too understand that market dont only recover after the pandemic is over, it can recover just because there is news that the worse MIGHT be over soon. I usually trade based on the company’s cash flow, past results and then human behavior. I am thinking once the public digest this piece of news, this share might go sliding down again. This might happen once the “panic buy” is over and then realise that the phase one results arent changing much now, same like how alot of people panic buy toilet paper for no apparent reason. It will then be a good time enter again too. Given the number of vaccine clinical trials out there, it wont be long there will be another good news again maybe? Again, this is just me sharing my personal opinion. Cheers to everyone and please refrain from insulting comments."
