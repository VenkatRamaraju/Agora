I expect it to drop dramatically. Their accounting numbers do not add up.
Here is a list of firms either downgrading BKNG or lowering price target since the earnings:Refinitiv/Verus -- downgrade just yesterdaySusquehanna -- downgrade just yesterdayNed Davis Research Group -- downgrade just yesterdayGoldman Sachs -- lowered price target post earningsJP Morgan -- lowered price target post earningsAre you still holding? They are not. They are rotating out at your expense.
"If you hold / buy both BKNG and SQ for the earnings, you are in big trouble tonight. Cant sleep !!"
"Now that tax reform has happened, already in the markets, a big correction is due. Tax reform will do little for technology as they already paid less than 20% and with reform hitting deductions some will actually see rates increase"
Is this a buy
"People are not realizing that travel industry is gone. Planes are sitting empty, nobody is going anywhere. BKNG will hit 1200 range. It is strange they haven't warned yet. Just a matter of a few days."
just get back to 1900
"Next resistanceis $1800s, today breakout from MA50 resistance!Bullish!"
"The perfect example of how the market is being played right now....$126 up in one day. Still, congrats to anyone that made money on this today."
"No one should be surprised always great numbers bad guidance, my puts will pay of today"
"Huge miss, but watch it go up double digits. typically move in todays market"
Why is this performing be than expedia? Is it a superior business model? Expe is down 20% from peak and flat for the year. Considering google entrance into the travel space. Expedia has been affected and booking will eventually be affected as well. There is the risk off thesis for booking in a nut shell.
BKNG (and EXPE etc) business is DEAD and not coming back anytime soon. Their earnings will be dismal and guidance will be near nothing. Nobody is traveling or booking in any quantity and UK/US just starting to climb the curve. I see this going below 1000 and will be bought out by Google or Amazon who have been wanting to get into travel bigly.
"Watch for this stock to dwindle down over the next week. After listening to the conference call, it’s obvious exec mgmt is worried abt the remaining year and 2021. They straight told us that it’ll take a number of years to even get back to previous levels. Not months, not the remaining year but a number of years. Glad I got out at $1460"
"every bigger event in Germany and Italy is getting canceled, this stock will be very good buy at some point in May or summer"
Target $1650!
Buy the dips
"If it rolls below 2010, I’m out. Be the first time in months I would be long position free. Starting not to like this outfit."
easy money here... sell buy puts. corona virus. next budweiser virus
"United just announced they are tripling flights, which means they have data to show that travel is back otherwise they wouldn't have that much confidence for such a large spike in flights. It is game on for BKNG and EXPE, and my bet is these are up between 20% and 50% by the end of the year. That said, I also believe they will surprise people with Q2 announcements above expectations (larger surge in volume as we see travel destinations crowed all May and June) plus the rest of summer should be as strong as ever, so expecting guidance to exceed expectations. Should be a great few months!"
17000 shares were dumped after hours in one shot at $1547.
Going to 1900 levels
"What good does it do to blowout earnings only to offer ‘soft guidance’? It makes the earnings report completely irrelevant. Wash, rinse, repeat"
"Not a single good thing in that report. Not short term, not long term. See you all at low $1200’s."
last minute short panic covering coming within the next 30 mins
Is it really up $12 after hours! ??!?!
"It’s so quiet here, seems no many care about the earning report. Very few stay in this stock now, like other high flyers, almost 100% controlled by big institutions."
if anybody can show me a delayed earnings that ended up a beat or good guidance just curious
"This is crazy and I am happy to be long here, even though I wish I had waited until it dropped below 1640. PE on 2018 earnings is 19. This will rebound just like it did last quarter. It may take a couple weeks though."
Missed by a metric mile.
I’ll buy when it touches $600.
"You have been lied to! I tried to book a trip, and the high costs in not giving me any travel plans! DONE W/ THIS INFLATION!!"
"i think this will go all the way to 1200 something, there is so much fear, all cancellations...short term this is going to go down but if disease is controlled maybe in 6 months time..this will be good buy then i guess."
"Personal thinking of my own, so please do take offence if you think I am wrong. I think today shows how public react to just a slightest news can affect the market. So I think during market crash, it is alot about investors confidence rather than how much a stock should be trading at and how the earning report is like. Of course, earning report is important as well for the basis of investing in a company which allow you to know how long a company can last in bad times. But it is important too understand that market dont only recover after the pandemic is over, it can recover just because there is news that the worse MIGHT be over soon. I usually trade based on the company’s cash flow, past results and then human behavior. I am thinking once the public digest this piece of news, this share might go sliding down again. This might happen once the “panic buy” is over and then realise that the phase one results arent changing much now, same like how alot of people panic buy toilet paper for no apparent reason. It will then be a good time enter again too. Given the number of vaccine clinical trials out there, it wont be long there will be another good news again maybe? Again, this is just me sharing my personal opinion. Cheers to everyone and please refrain from insulting comments."
Why was this down 40 points off it's high yesterday?
Congrats to anyone that made money on this today. It's amazing that THIS stock actually covered yesterdays losses.
It started to tank but got held up. Should have stayed in the mid $1300 today. Still think it will before end of market. Then $1200 Monday/Tuesday.
"WIth current CFO retiring in couple of weeks (after 14 years at Priceline), could PCLN split its shares 5:1 or 7:1 when they announce results tomorrow? At $1900+, it seems like a perfect move. That would pop the stock price for sure!"
"EXPE results bode very well for BKNG, Deutsche Bank just raised the price target from 2150 to 2370 on Tuesday."
Glen Fogel needs to be replaced as CEO. This company hasn't been going anywhere for the last 2 years
"As a long term holder, they always guide conservatively every quarter: beat_repeat, beat_repeat, beat_repeat"
In march they will warn shareholders about revenues in the first quarter...nobody is travelling anymore. Waiting to see BKNG in the range 1300-1400 for a better buy
"I repeat the idea of ""Reverse Split Short Squeeze"" is terrifying to the shorts, so they spread as much misinformation as possible to scare uniformed investors into selling. $BKNG is an example of a reverse split that has been successful. $GE will be successful also."
"Earnings coming. Companies with great earnings could not articulate what the future holds; their stock price dropped like a rock. What do you think is going to happen to BKNG after their earnings call? Terrible quarter, absolutely no idea what future holds for them...BKNG will be at $900 a share. $200 drop after earnings, then steady down with the rest of the market. Mark my word."
Results are not out yetPatience
2100 in short time and moving to 2500
"Booking Holdings announced today that it intends to hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2021 financial results on Wednesday, August 4 at 4:30 p.m. ET. The event will be webcasted."
Looks like some short covering at the end of the day
i am so short
Need a good run. Strong showing.
Booking.com (part of PCLN) has filed large profits yesterday and analysts say it won't decrease in the future. That is better future results for PCLN
How is this stock still near it’s bubble highs? They will continue to lose money for the foreseeable future. This is another Wall Street darling like chipotle that trades on nothing but a popularity contest. This company is functionally bankrupt in this envioronment
Google or someone should easily be able to buy this thing for $2100.
BKNG has been cutting deeply into margins to get business. Earnings will expose this desperation and lights out.
"As I have said booking will bounce back. @Kevin CEO’s cannot give guarantees, they will get penalized ( Elon Musk) before Tesla reached $1000. They will under promise & over deliver. $3000 in the next few months market correction is over ( greed & fear are holding the stock back). I knew when the market was going to crash & I warned everyone I knew December 2018 -2019( I also told them Covid might be the match that start the fire ). This is going back up w a fury. End of June-july 10th will only be the start. @kevin I hope you’re here in July, I will say “I told you so.....” "
$65 runup to earnings...priceless. I think this market is way too euphoric.
Earning is out and stock is up 4%
"they are doing more layoffs, going down tomorrow. Business is not recovering; not until late 2021 with a vaccine. The CEO himself said it. Will go down to $1200 soon. Patience will pay off big. Has no more room to go up; lots of room to go down."
Appears they guided lower on earnings and revenue unless I'm missing something.
Like I said about the realistic gap
They scared me out yesterday but got in this morning. I think we finally get that big move we’ve been waiting for!
"Technicals on markets breaking down along with technology stocks, setting up anyone who bought in quickly at the top"
"Way over bought, travels will not be changing much with this vaccine news. Way overpriced"
"Wow 4K in 10 minutes. Tooks a risk, bought 50 shares just before close and sold at 80 points profit after close. This stock is strange lol"
"I just bought another 500 BKNG shares. Earning call in early Aug and I’m convinced it will be extremely positive and beat the analysts predictions. No ones traveling abroad on holidays and hotels are in a bad situation, so everyone’s vacationing in their own states either in an RV or in a short term rental home...reserved through Booking"
target raised to $3200given COVID numbers are trending down with vaccines in the horizon worldwide;BKNG has been under pressure since last March...
Trump gets elected again and the market is going higher
"All travel websites stocks are crashing $EXPE, $TRIP, $BKNG in preparation for AirBnB IPO next year. AirBnB is verifying all room listings now and becoming a serious player in this space, and a lot of money will flow to its IPO."
"I think Rafi makes a great point. 2020 has been a bizarre year when looking at IPO price increases on day 1. Airbnb was valued privately at $18B in April... of course, April was a hard time to raise money given the early impact of COVID... so for a business in the accommodation industry to raise $1B at that time was, of course, a win. But has there been any material changes in the business since then? For it be worth $18B only 8 months ago and $100B today... and priced at $47B at the IPO price. Check out my thoughts on investing in IPOs these days. Lockup period expiration often presents better buying opportunities, the only thing is 6 months from now travel may be starting up again (maybe) in which case this is bullish for Airbnb... some things to consider as well as a comparison with $ABNB and $BKNG in the analysis I did here - https://youtu.be/XZdiwg3wSEQ"
Will rebound back to $1730 by tomorrow
Booking Holdings Inc. $BKNG Total Debt (mrq) 14.17BBooking Holdings Inc. $BKNG Book Value Per Share (mrq) 116.05
I hope this doesn't reverse like I've seen few other stocks do lately
CFO just talked about share buyback.... Good decision!
"1960, would be so nice. I’m not seeing it though."
Look at WTW great price to buy
This should be valued more than AirBNB. Let's be real.
"The company will start trading under the new ticker symbol BKNG on February 27, 2018 which leads me to think that good news is coming."
Can someone pls explain to me how booking is holding up in this market.
Manipulation at its finest today!Upgrades coming now as stock went oversoldby 5%
"Can’t wait until after hours Tuesday going to drop like a brick, Great Short!!"
You guys need to realize that so many traditional travel agencies actually went bankrupt. Bookings will gain substantial market share.
Priceline/Booking is the biggest online travel company in THE WORLD. Give it time to hit bottom and then it will come back up! :-)
"Bkng upgraded by S&P late yesterday. Press release in Bloomberg and TD Ameritrade / ThinkorSwim, but not yet in Yahoo, marketwatch, etc. This should lower borrowing rate, and hence improve future income. This should push the stock price up.... We should buy before price jumps"
Earnings call on 8/8/18
"This should make the price go even higher next week.Britain says almost all travelers arriving in U.K. must self-quarantine for 14 days starting June 8LONDON — British Home Secretary Priti Patel unveiled the government’s new travel quarantine strategy on Friday, warning that almost all arrivals to the United Kingdom — including citizens returning home — must self-isolate for 14 days and face spot checks by police, facing high fines and possible expulsion for violations.The new measures will begin June 8. Those who fly into Britain will have to tell authorities the address where they intend to self-isolate, give officials their contact details and download a tracking app designed by the National Health Service that is still in development.The new quarantine measures will be among the most strict in Europe and effectively dash summer travel plans in the short term. Earlier, there was speculation that travelers would be able to move more easily between France and Britain, but there was no exception for France.The government said that there would be exceptions for some — airplane pilots, truck drivers, medical workers and seasonal farmhands. Visitors from Ireland would also be exempt.If travelers do not have a hotel or home address at which to quarantine, they will be sent to “facilities arranged by the government” and will be billed for the stay there.Patel said that Britain “was not shutting down completely. We’re not closing our borders.” But all travel should be essential travel, she said.“This is not about booking holidays,” Patel said. “We want to avoid a second wave.”"
Expedia went up 8% today after earning reportOn 8/8 Bookings will report earnings and I think it too will report strong numbers and we will see it make a new high to over $2225
should u call this tomorrow?
"perfect for longs to get out. It broke through all resistances above $1290 today. It means, it will revisit and will go down further to $1290. Note high volume on down and low volume on up movements."
come on stay above 1950 and get to 1960
They changed the stock ticker today so people would have trouble selling when the panic happens. The stock is been trading in line with Expedia for two years. Expedia just had a really bad quarter sending that stock down 15%. I have no idea why this stock hasn't sold off from the bad results of Expedia. It's going to be a bloodbath after earnings come out. I just bought an 1800 put. Time to make some money
"Ponder this. Why not AMZN buy BKNG? They get the company at 2100 approximately $100 billion. $55 EPS, shrinks AMZN’s PE & BKNG grows even more with a link on their website to all the BKNG brands? Thoughts?"
Even with Earnings miss it still seems like the street liked it. We are up after hours quite a bit! Also watching this other one while we see how the street digests this one. https://alldaytrading.market/FeaturedstockPick
Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $45.36 beats by $0.93; GAAP EPS of $45.54 beats by $2.03.Revenue of $5.04B (+3.9% Y/Y) misses by $30M.Shares +5.41%
Completely underestimate the Corona Virus's impact to their business.
this is now higher than pre covid. madness. who is booking... and travelling.
"The surprising thing about BKNG today is not that it's down $66, but why it isn't down $166. Travel is over. Travel is over until the virus plays out. No one in their right mind is going to public or crowded places & spaces."
Its certainly a whole lot easier to travel within the US vs. traveling outside the US. Traveling to Canada and this Covid testing sure isnt as simple as it should be. The frustration is both leaving the US entering Canada and then returning home.
They had some interesting insights about BKNG on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Buying a call - now
How is this stock up with AMEX reporting such miserable results in travel today?
"A few days later, still a janky play."
"Looks like they blew out the numbers and, once again, give poor guidance. Time for the Executive Board to be taken out and the SEC investigate. Smacks of manipulation."
"The company is not likely to get back to its 2019 numbers till best case 2021, worst case 2023. This all depends on how quickly people get vaccinated. Officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci estimate a vaccine could arrive in at least 12 to 18 months or by Aug 2021. Vaccine development is a long, complex process, normally lasting 10-15 years and involving a combination of public and private involvement. Most companies are either in Phase I or Phase II of Clinical Trials. While there are several companies racing towards the vaccine, researchers caution that less than 10 percent of drugs that enter clinical trials are ever approved by the FDA. Economic conditions are also not in favor of BKNG. Unemployment rate is at 14% now and is expected to increase to 20% by Q4 2020. GDP is expected to contract by 7% in Q3 and 3% in Q4 2020. Consumer sentiment is at 71 and is forecasted to go to 65 at the end of the year. The index is not expected to get back to the 2019 levels till late 2021. Finally, disposal personal income is expected to drop from $17,000 to $15,000 by end of 2021. All this indicate that people will not be flying or going on vacations like they did before anytime soon."
makes no difference now or tomorrow morning in terms of market reaction. They have messed up some calculations or regulatory compliance that needs to be corrected. As simple as that.
$2100+ by Friday - upvote if you agree
"Priceline's CEO was on last week's Sunday program, touting the the company... it seemed more like a short infomercial... it's those little things that tell a lot. So in this case, the guidance is dismal and they knew this to where they did that infomercial... unbelievable but makes sense."
Disaster zone for the next few months for travel industry. BKNG share price will crash to sub $500.
this should easily surpass 2200 by next quarter due to low p/e and growth.
I would look out for BKNG> They are upsetting many of their customers thru their subdivision Priceline. The charge a booking fee for cruises and when the Cruise lines canceled their sailings Priceline will not refund the booking fee. It is not a large fee $25 but it is making customers mad that they are adding insult to injury of not being to travel as they planned.
"the moment the HK protest stops, this stock is at its bottom"
they missed sales expectations and EPS only beat bc of the share buyback.
I'm riding this down to 1500
"going back to 2000 plus in 2 weeks easy, results in a months time. Correction is over."
10 days green pump and a few hundred shares after hour just to show it up.... strong believe big dump tommorrow. Canada made travel restriction so hard that it cost so much to go any where...
"this is the easiest short since cmg. will miss on earnings. no airplanes, revenues. long live corona."
At least -100 after earnings. May be more.
Airbnb is a much better stock for future growth and stockprice increases. ABNB is the future of travel.
"I am short 60 shares at 1910 down 12 grand now ? how much higher can this go , is there a justification for a price this high"
GOLDEN cross happening to downside today on charts
outlook can't be very good when you have a stock tanking the two days before earnings. Saw this with AMZN
or they are announcing something like stock split or something similar
Is the earning out?
"This is going back to less than $1000 in very short time, COVID is going to continue till early next year and travel sector is almost doing no business due to work from home and disease spread. This is STRONG SELL"
So happy to see the market correction of this overpriced stock.
"If BKNG breaks 2000 in a strong surge, it will make new highs shortly afterwards ... and is exactly how it looks now. This is going to be a very strong quarter."
Google and Amazon are going to eat booking soon with their own reservation websites
because news out of Italy shows cases decreasing for 2 days. market discounts ahead of time
"Hype lasts so long, as I have said before. BKNG is going down hard simply because pre-Covid levels won't be achieved for another 2-3 years. The CEO himself said it. Tomorrow is a down day, and usually BKNG goes down by much larger percentage as compared to the overall market. You are lucky if you sold it today."
"Amazon hooking up with Expedia and leaving PCLN in the cold:But it didn't stop there as American travel company Expedia also inked an agreement with AWS on Wednesday. Expedia announced that it would standardize AWS machine learning technologies to improve travelers' booking experiences across its brands.""The travel industry giant chose AWS for its highly scalable infrastructure, unmatched breadth of cloud services, and proven operational expertise,"" Amazon said."
There’s also one at 2180 I think that’s the realistic one
"Finally, some rationality."
"Earnings of $3.77 a share vs analyst estimate of $6.10. Keep in mind, pandemic only affected their business by about 2 weeks worth. Company had issues prior to the pandemic. I expect the stock to steadily decline over the next week. YES THINK LOGICALLY. Unprecedented times, NOBODY is booking anything and even when things clear up, majority of people will not take any chances especially since there’s concerns of a resurgence."
i will buy feb calls in first wk of jan...this stock can go up 10 points before earnings
This has the potential of being a very good day for us!
Why is BKNG so volatile???
thinking about buying 1905 call for friday just scared they are going to pin it at 1900
Resistance at MA200==$1750--$1820any price below that is god-gift!
"will lose $20 a share before close today. Tomorrow, the markets will be red, it will lose another $50 or so. On the day of the earnings call, and Friday, expect this to be in low $1200's. From there; it is down to $900 in a month or so."
Great Beat. BKNG = PCLN = 2250 soon
looks like a red dayI'll be happy If it stays above 1935 or 30
"We are at multi-year highs! Are there any ""pandemic"" plays still somewhere? Where?"
"Now, have you people figured out to throw your charts out the window and stop following the little colored lines on them?"
half more hour to go to play er in priceline land AH
Sub 1700 friday
Great results overall for all of their businesses. 15% YoY growth is phenomenal. The stock is already starting to tick up. Wouldn't be surprise to see 5-7% move upwards tomorrow morning.Possible share buyback coming?
this is going to 1200 or below..but will be good buy before summer when virus news will be gone.
"You can't buy good travel stock for cheap when everyone is going back to travel. Everyone expects Q1Q2Q3 are disaster, so what are the surprise? Not an opinion to trading boy, but at least short Expedia instead which has much worse balance sheet and management team. Why go against undervalued good company? I don't get it."
I told you...get out now while you can. They said it takes two years to recover travel back to 2019 levels in the earnings call. Do you think anyone is going to hold this for two years? Painful selling is coming. Yesterday’s run was a trap.
"When lockdown is open , BKNG will be up huge!BKNG is the only big-cap stock tat is grossly undervalued by at least 40%"
way oversold...time to buy and sell around 2100
"Is BKNG going into correction ahead for earnings? Seems like there is a lot noise that hospitality/hoteling industry not doing well and heading into a very difficult Q4 (china issue, Brexit, HongKong in recesssion etc)."
"tomorrow is the earnings call; if you are not seeing the trend, you are blind. The day to come out of this position was three days ago, but today is certainly better than tomorrow. BKNG has such small trading volume; once it starts going down, it will be $100's down to $1100. After the earning s call; it will be brutal."
6 months of gains wiped out.
Who’s buying?
"Digging into the recent 10Q...impairments of $100 million and $489 million for Kayak and Open Table goodwill were expensed. An impairment cost must be included under expenses when the book value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment of assets is the diminishing in quality, strength amount, or value of an asset. Imo, if the quality, strength or value of assets are decreasing and getting smaller, then the stockprice should also decrease as liabilities overtake capital."
"It is time to get into BKNG now; cruise line stocks, airline stocks all up on potential vaccines of BNTX, NVAX, MRNA...."
Hahahahaha. I am glad I chickened out at a nice profit and covered at 1840. Had a bad experience with AMZN. Had a nice profit but held on expecting nice earnings but it tumbled 300 points. I was short in this one but covered today at not much 60 points profit.
Booking is up 4.99% to 2244.04
travel and hotels stocks are biggest bubble here. Booking golden days are probably gone for ever post covid world. This stock should settle around 800 to 900 by end of year.
Is Booking Holding the same as Priceline? If it is...when they change their name from Priceline to Booking Holding? Thanks in advance for your respond.
most affected and risky stock...with all travel ban ..this will now go to 600..fast ..
Will Expedia be the next booking?
As Olivier Said. Today Booking announced that they wil refund The Dutch government for spending their government funds on bonuses
"1360 -1365 is a test of support today imo, then possibly 1325-1335 this week. The big technical negative recently developing is the breakdown in price from the ascending wedge pattern."
"Share price has gotten way ahead of itself. No one will book anything before the China virus spread is tamped down. A small reflection of normalcy will not occur until at least the autumn of 2021. Air travel, cruises, entertainment will not recover pre covid level for at least several years."
BKNG is gold mine! Coming down fast. It was a great day today!
"when this jumps back, easy 150 to 200 plus in a weeks time."
BIG CRASH COMING POST RESULTS.
"Wedgewood partners just dumped this stock and I quote. “In fact, shortly after our sale, Booking reported much worse than expected first quarter booking trends, coming in -30% below lowered expectations. In addition, the Company reported that April was even worse, with booked room nights collapsing -85% in the month”."
BKNG has huge upside potential!
"As I'm working in hotel industry I can confirm that this company is the only one that send reservations now, expedia doesnt produce anything comparing to bkng. So I do not understand why such a huge drop last two days, and the drop is bigger than expe..."
"Price today is higher then before Covid.... The company makes revenue from booking travel and hotels... Hotels are going bankrupt left and right, revenue is falling at each and every hotel. Banks are not even extending credit to hotels or any travel business. Yet, investors drive a travel stock to new highs expecting the best case scenario and betting on a recovery so quick that we will be back to higher than 2019 levels in how many years ? if this is not the irrational looking you in the face, I have no idea what is."
"Fake price, this will crash to 1900 and below next week with results. Covid is getting bad with no travel and more work from home will cause not much travel in future."
Bet we hit $2300 after earnings
What happened here?
Next quarterly report maybe better than expected.
"Best time to buy is when the news is really bad. Can't get much worse for the travel sector. Even if a cruise ship or airline goes bankrupt, it just means fewer cruise ships and airlines."
So happy I didn’t sell today
Bkng is a great company but unfortunatly nobody is going to travel for months...this stock is going much lower...
Why the drop?
awesome earning...back on track to $2250 before year end and $2500 /share by summer 2019. Love this stock. In this environment you need stocks of companies that return huge cash flow and EPS. BKNG is one of the best there. Just the buy back over the last quarter should be 4% additive to the stock price (6% up in after hours) and the will buy more as they stated in the call.
Well enjoy it shorts You will never get this chance again
"BELIEVE Me: I had around 5000 shares of PCLN after REVERSE SPLIT (believe it was 2003).I kept buying PCLN at $3 all the way to $1.8 if I can remember exactly. Put All my money in it, was one of my FIRST stock ever, PALM too. But during that time, Market Makers were CRASHING PCLN 6% to 16% per day. Still held on, and bought more. Then when market started rising, PCLN was forced by Bankersto do REVERSE SPLIT 1 for 7 or something. $2+ became $14 per share. While the BULL MARKET was raging,The Bankers, Market Makers kept CRASHING PCLN to $9. I was NEW to stocks, sweating bullets, SCARED, emotional wreck, cursing at my misfortune. Finally SOLD all my REVERSE SPLIT PCLN stock, around 5000 sharesfor $9+. Took the money and bought PALM.Shaking my head now. Now I know it was Orchestrated SHAKE the TREE, and I got shaken out of my PCLN shares at $9.Today I would have been a MULTI MILLIONAIRE, $9,000,000 to be EXACT. Waw!!Anyone holding PCLN from back in the day, $9, pl reply, would love to hear your story.."
"with EPS of 50 and ratio of 40, this thing is going to recover and then some to $2600 before year end."
Loss of $10.81 per share & revenues fell 83.6% year/year to $630 mln Good lord. Surprised this is even up after hours.
"It’s amazing the broader markets are holding up when all the data points to another correction down. This stock would be in the $1200s by today if the broader markets went down with the ugly data we’re getting. With that said, still think this will be in the $1200s this week especially if the market drops like it’s suppose to."
"Very smart statement by the CEO travel won’t come back as pre covid, really sharp"
"Dow, NASDAQ, S&P in the green, BKNG is red. Dow and S&P will close in the red today; therefore BKNG will go down further. My prediction of $1350 for today is a no brainer, but now I think it will be at $1342 before close."
BKNG? I thought it was Burger King.
"I am holding a few shares and hence just sharing my views on this. Lots of companies been thru the sharp fall in price in mid-end March when countries started implementing lockdown. I THINK the market already expected/digested the news that Q1 aint gonna be great especially for tourism related companies, hence the fall during then. Meaning to say, price drop already factored in the Q1 bad earnings and thus not affected much after the Q1 earning report released. If you look at the reported numbers, you would know that it isnt shortfall alot from the estimated in actual. The 489 reported expenses for goodwill which most probably refer to booking refunds wont happen every quarter especially with lesser bookings since the epidemic broke out in beginning 2020. I will be holding for the long term (3-5 years) to bounce back. Booking is one of the better companies with huge cash flow to withstand this period. If they cant, then I think there will be alot more companies to fall victim first before they do (Expedia, Ctrip, Tripadvisor, and lots of airlines!) and we all know that it is pretty impossible for so many companies to go bust at one financial crisis isnt it. I would like to state that this is my personal opinion and every investment we do comes with certain risk. So guys, whether you are long or short on this. Just remember to diversify your ammo accordingly. Cheers! :)"
Will be running up quick into earnings.
"held up on small volume, sold out on big volume; check it out on the chart. All the signs of an upcoming sell off are there. For every seller, there is a buyer, so some have to be convinced at every resistance level. This is so perfectly set up and manipulated. A trap before the earnings, and now the cat and mouse game."
"Something is up guys, options calls are near the highs of the day, yet stock is 7 points off high! We’re getting some news! Can you say call premium!?!"
"Something isn't adding up with the United story. The EU just put out the not welcome sign for US travelers yesterday. They will review the ban every two weeks bases on the COVID 19 statistics. In four weeks will the US infection rate subside enough for the ban to be lifted? I don't think that's likely based on the rate of infections still going up in the US, and the death rate is projected to go up due to death rates lagging infection rates by weeks. Also, in August families will be dealing with the issue of sending their kids back to school during a still raging pandemic. Who is going to travel to Europe with that on their mind? Why is United""s stock not up on the news?What am I missing?"

"This stock should be trading way below $600? Low float and high stock price is the only reason this is not down more than 50%. SEC should be investigating this company.""(Bloomberg) -- Booking Holdings Inc. reported a decline of more than 85% in room nights booked in April from a year earlier, a staggering drop that reflects the extent of economic devastation the coronavirus is wreaking on the travel industry.Chief Executive Officer Glenn Fogel also said that newly booked room nights, excluding cancellations, fell 60% year-over-year in March. “This gives you a clear indication of how much our business is currently impacted by this crisis,” he said during a conference call.Booking is the first of the online travel giants to report earnings this year and its results will be held up as benchmark for its smaller rivals trying to weather the crisis.The company said the number of room night reservations dropped 43% from a year earlier in the first quarter, while Wall Street had estimated a decline of 29%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gross travel bookings, which reflect all travel services booked by customers, came in at $12.4 billion, a 51% decrease, Norwalk, Connecticut-based Booking said Thursday in a statement. Revenue fell 19% to $2.29 billion in the period, beating the $2.15 billion projected by analysts."""
Maybe it's just me but with travel non existent how does this stock run up 75 points yesterday and another 33 points today?
"Booking, priceline...has saved me thousands over the years. One advantage over the other sites is that the hotels and airlines can access bookings data to make changes, apply frequent flyer miles etc. Many people dont realize that."
Missed all their numbers but what’s the outlook? And why isn’t the stock moving??? This should be tanking into the $1200s after that ER.
"let's see. ....beat by > $3 on EPS, but miss on Q1 expectation by $1.60, and goes down by 10%? I'm buying in the morning. Expect a quick snap back to 1800+. glta"
"Not an investor but we just tried to cancel rental car for Maui and they refused. Flights cancelled, hotels cancelled, Thrifty said only Priceline can cancel because they have not paid thrifty yet. We were traveling to Maui this week but island has shut down. Any thoughts?"
BOOKING.YEAH - let's go! I need $2200+
buy. will sky rocket in 2 months
Pcln has jumped 200 plus points in Jan. 1726 I remember....it is quite natural to pause or descend before take off...my feeling is it will drop 100 plus points before earning which will boost its price.I bought 1850 puts today
"I have followed Jim Cramer since his Cramer-Kudlow show many years ago. He is a very good commentator on educating people regarding the stock market, identifying the principles of investing, and understanding market cycles. However, he is problematic when it comes to stock picking. I have found his advice on specific stocks to be a hit and miss over the years. I think BKNG is a good example of how unreliable he is on choosing stocks. BKNG is down nearly 10% since earnings and it may drift lower, but the stock is probably a good entry point for a longterm play."
Great earnings. Kudos to those who are long. Last quarter the stock kicked me in the teeth. Today I have a nice recovery.
can we atleast see 1900
Nervous. I hold a few shares of Booking. Is anyone even using their site? Planes are empty and hotels are too. Trying to figure out if they are actually even getting any business now or in the near future
No reason for this “travel” $SABR stock to be down. They manage ticketing for major airlines like $AAL around the world and much cheaper compared to $BKNG stock.
"Great correction not only to PCLN but, will happy to market in coming days !!! But, PCLN is Safe n Sound + CHEAP at low 1600’s"

"If you don't catch the trend, you will end up losing big money. Markets will go down in the next month or so...regardless travel stocks will be dead. AMZN shows good profits, gets corrected. MSFT and GOOG makes money, but post earnings initial jump, they go down. BKNG is going to report horrible and is going to say no money to be made for this year and perhaps next year; what do you think is going to happen?$900 a share coming in a hurry. They report in 3 days!"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
BKNG is ready for next run: buy any weakness:Target $2800
"Holding thru earnings? I'm a bit scared, this thing had a history of selling off after."
BKNG upgraded by S&P.... Hopefully this will push up the stock price.
I am regretting....I bought March 16 puts strike 2175 at 20...hoping and praying to sell it at 40 in next three days
"Travel, hotel, high techs, biotechs- HUGE BUBBLE"
Bought some today - thanks for selling to me
"this company is not making any money there are no travelers how come the stock is $1,700"
"Stock price is still at 2016 levels when the economy was kicking and doing well. Zero travel and they’re now expecting 25% of pre shutdown traveling at best with potential bankruptcy of airline companies. Let that sink in and prepare for another drop. Looks like it’s already started now. It’s in the $1300s finally, delayed reaction but it’s now there. Somewhere in the $1200s by the end of this week."
"If the gains over the past half year haven't been enough to whet your appetite as a shareholder, just imagine the gain when the economy fully reopens. I forecast $3000 a share over the long haul, possibly more. If they are able to do this well when travel is so restricted just imagine how they'll do once travel resumes. Extremely bullish for the remainder of this year."
Something going on. Anyone who buys is crazy. I have never seen delayed earnings. At 2K a share the risk is to great.
"REMINDER------ BKNG Going down---- back to $ 1521.00 Again, because total market already on the peek, make since guys"
the stock is up 5.4% after hours so far.
Ripped off by Priceline. Reserved a Casino Hotel as advertised got non casino. Said tough. Got another room previous agreed upon price when I paid was 500 percent higher then advertised. Anyone else ripped off by Priceline. If they advertise a casino hotel they should have to give you a casino hotel. Bait and switch then tell you no recourse Class Action?
"what the hec, stock going UP after ER, such a run and now going UP. really?"
dang should of kept that call
You think goes up to $1950? Maybe $1900 with fingers cross.
Lot of downgrades today by J.P. Morgan for hotel/hospitality industry. Anybody knows why?I was reading the analyst conference notes and they talked a lot about China travel and potential impact from Brexit with UK business. Seems like these are negative catalyst that will impact stock in next 1 month. Is it time to take some profits off the table?
"Today, the markets are tanking. If they go further down, BKNG will be below $1300 today."
"Honest question, why is this stock higher than it was pre covid, wouldn’t this company be especially hit hard by covid? Not a short or a long but just curious"
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6XlWVLpdUSee timestamps for Booking Holdings
BKNG will hit 2000 again within 2 weeks time
$2100 tomorrow
Is this Priceline? What happened to PCLN?
Rally continues for a second day with no tests of support.
Cash business like BKNG with no bookings because of pandemic spells disaster for share price. They'll have to start selling stock to keep afloat thus diluting and crashing their own share price.
"booking just withdrew guidance, this is going to 800 or less in 3 months."
We’re about to get the volume!
haha...... Shorts are losing their shorts... literally. BKNG is up at $2010.... $2200 is in in close range now!
Trump economy
"Not any post ER release comments, so Ill just say, looking strong, going forward."
$BKNG $TRVG $EXPE Trivago Posts RECORD double-digit net income finance.yahoo.com/news/post...
2100 definable seems attainable today. Hang in there folks.
"I hope people who are in for long, managed to profit a little from the market today! Cheers to everyone!"
"In Europe all trade fairs are getting canceled, businesses are banning and restricting travel. No travel for next 3 months, maybe 6. There will be a lot of discounts on booking.com and probably BKNG will get heavily discounted."
"How will booking do on positive Regeneron news for treatment of Covid. Airlines should be up, booking should be up."
very overvalued considering all contries are closing due to covid and vaccines are not helping much. so many contries facing 2nd 3rd and 4th waves and closing due to mutated corona. this will come crashing below 2000 in 3 months.
A month ago pcln was 1730
"Well, on its way to low $1200's. There are no two-ways about it. The market will correct too. As I said, once it starts going down, you cannot catch it, it goes down fast. $25/share down today was a preview. It will go down $50 or $70 at a time, in two or three days, before you know it, it will be below $1250. Then you will be looking at mounting losses, unless you really are into this for the long haul; meaning 2-3 years."
"No bookings, no travel, no business...watch BKNG going way low...time to short"
"Forward PE is now in the 16-17 range. Historically a good buy signal for PCLN/BKNG. Strong beat + guidance usually overly conservative + impressive growth in alternative accommodation are independent positives to consider. If they can ever get the U.S. domestic business to catch fire like Europe, look out. Growth in alternative accom may be that opportunity."
"As more people get vaccines, travel will be back to normal in 6-9 months or so:BKNG target $3000!"
"sentiment reversed, should cross 1900 soon towards 1950"
BKNG reached a new All Time High at 2199.78
just bought a little. let's hope for good things
At these levels GOOG or AMZN should make a buyout offer to gain control of travel industry online
"2300 calls for July 16th Watch those go from $400 to $7,000 a popBkng right next to 200dma and will form a double bottom. Only up from here."
"Another recent negative, breaking down through the 50 day sma"
"just the beginning, no guidance from Booking for this year and probably reduced significantly for next year too. still overvalued"
Do I see 1730 tomorrow?
After earning announced. It will go up by $125 to $175 on Wednesday
"Can’t wait until the monster drop, shorted 500 shares"
Booking Holdings (BKNG) reported 1st Quarter March 2018 earnings of $12.00 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $10.68 per share on revenue of $2.9 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $11.00 per share.
Is there any after hour trading on this stock?
when is the Earnings announcement?
"well, i think this will correct up before and normal market time."
Great article by Christine Tan for CNBC. This stk is going much higher by end of year. Blowout earnings are ahead.
This is where us humans have more sense than bots. Bots just keep selling when they hit the programmed mark; poor mutual fund holders. No wonder they make 4%.
"Bookings is down from here, will stop at 1200 during the first phase."
Amazing....
go BKNG go 1930 close come on
"Be interesting what this does tomorrow, missed revenue by 30mil and revised lower for Q4. Isn't the EPS beat due to buy backs? A lot of the increases were impressive but have a feeling a lot of that was expected so not expecting a crazy increase tomorrow"
"Selling volume aside, they will take a big hit on insurance claims for trip protection. I'm betting they viewed the insurance premiums as free money and never accounted for a major loss like the one they are facing now."
This price action seems like a huge overreaction to lowered guidance. They just beat by $1! And they always low ball the guidance. This will be right back to 2000 before long. What a great company.
so much strength in this position. I love BKNG (PCLN)...this one stock has made me richer than I ever imagined. I have been a holder for many years. Tempted to sell...but keeps going up and no turning around. I think $2500 is within reach before year end if the Macro does not fall apart.
Would be nice if they announce a stock split
welp I was wrong
