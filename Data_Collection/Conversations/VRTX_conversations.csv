Up but making lower lows everyday
No hope here
Seriously thinking on accepting my loss on this #$%$ C K I N G company (20% loss in 6 months and almost 40% in one year). Wondering why the whole Board and C levels were not fired yet ...
MS Downgraded to underweight.

"Wow, another new 52 week low"
This stock is manipulated dropped to 190ish a few times only to rebound straight away. They know where the majority of the stops are trigger them then buy at the low. I agree with the comment below that it's too expensive to be taken over.Not sure how well run it is but Institutions own 91.7% of the shares.Something strange with the pricing seems cheap which is why I bought. They make a lot of money from a tiny range of drugs.
New 52 week low. VRTX has nice fundamentals but the charts tell the real stort. They need a catalyst like new approvals beyond CF.
"Barrons' is again bullish:https://www.barrons.com/articles/healthcare-stocks-undervalued-screen-51634750556[[...The company’s core cystic fibrosis franchise remains strong, however, and analysts haven’t lost faith. Earlier this week, Vertex announced positive data on the first patient treated in a Phase 1/2 trial of a new stem cell-derived therapy to treat Type 1 diabetes. Of the 27 tracked by FactSet who cover the stock, 20 rate it a Buy or Overweight, while five rate it a Hold and two rate it a Sell.Their average target price of $260.52 suggests a 41.9% gain from the stock’s recent price of $183.62.“We continue to think the stock is not currently pricing-in any credit to the pipeline, and credit is currently being given only to the base business,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note out Oct. 14."
the stock is just preforming well and its CF monopoly will most likley stay for a while.growth in patients and reimbursments will push revenue for a while but EU approvals arent a big deal. (make a lot less)CTX001 will be the reason for vertex to become a 100 billion+ company (will take a 1/2 years) hopefully a couple of phase 3's by that time.200 dollars per share for this company is way to low not to take an advantage.
"WELL....it is nice to see vrtx basically 'holding steady' during this down day in the markets. I imagine, we have a established a sturdy floor/base here around $187ish. (time will tell)"
As a former employee of Vertex I must say that it's best days are behind it.
Love it….where are the bears waiting to buy at 120 lol….. get on board now…. Gonna be a slow grind back to 200.

Vertex cash cash cash cash
"The reason this is dropping is not related to sales, expenses, product or performance. Someone has targeted this with $185.00 put options with a equity value of over $9,000,000. They usually don't hit the strike and unload for a tidy profit on VRTX. Time will tell."
I see no support before 120
I didn't think these gains were going to hold. Just another bounce in the middle of a long established down trend. How low this things goes is anybody's guess.
VRTX is about to cure diabetes. you are crazy to not buy this
Readers beware of Scotty! Before you take any of his advice on big pharma just remember three months ago he was advocating for ENDO PHARMA when it was almost $8…. And today they are close to bankruptcy and trading at $2! I thought you should all know that before reading his posts!
"Why should investors have this large-cap biotech stock on their radars right now? Within the next three years, Vertex has a better-than-average chance of opening up an entirely new treatment modality through its expansion into gene editing. The biotech already has a promising collaboration underway with CRISPR Therapeutics, and it recently inked another deal with privately held Arbor Biotechnologies to explore the development of next-generation gene-editing technologies for a host of disorders. These two gene-editing partnerships could set the biotech on the path toward high double-digit revenue growth for the better part of the next two decades.What's the downside risk? Vertex's shares are currently trading at roughly six times 2022 projected revenue. That's not a particularly rich valuation within the realm of biotech, and it certainly doesn't reflect the enormous upside potential stemming from the company's foray into gene editing. In short, Vertex's stock is arguably grossly undervalued at this point -- meaning that another clinical flop probably won't have a significant impact on its share- motley fool… ………………….Biggest thing they are forgeting… vertex has cash… and are also making lots of money…. They can buy companies or do partnerships…"
Today market rallies huge and this I can’t even participate. Ceo needs to go or sell the company.
Sell off is kicking in. Waiting for $120. Best deal 110.

The only time this stock goes up is when they purchase their own stock. Nobody is buy Leiden’s story anymore. The financial institutions are selling every week. The BOD of this company is a joke. If they would do their jobs the CEO and chairman would be looking for new jobs today …

Why isn't this rocketing? A diabetic patient started to produce insulin again and no longer needs diabetes medications!!!!
"All the financials are great, the collaboration with CRSP is showing great potential, so will my 10 shares be worth about a million in a few months? Down here in New Zealand house prices are so extreme that I'm hoping this one will be my winning lottery ticket."

"lol there’s a guy named Scotty syphilis who bought this in June at $216, can you imagine what he’s thinking?"
"How serious is potential competitive threat from Abbv's CF drugs?A very pessimistic view to this question was the basis for Matt Harrison's (of MS) downgrade of $VRTX about a month ago. Since then, CEO refuted Matt's view very well in the conf. call of MS on Sept. 15.She said that Trikafta alone already set a high bar in both safety and efficacy for any potential competitor. No oral drug can surpass the sweat chloride level of CFTR carriers, but Trikafta already achieved the carrier level of sweat chloride. Furthermore, for the long term Trikafta achieved a milestone no other drugs could: two year data showed that there was no decline in the lung function. Trikafta is not just slowing the decline, but stopping the decline. For safety Vertex already has ten thousand patients' safety data.As if that is not enough, Vertex is going to run the ph.3 trial for VX-121/Tez/VX-561 combo soon. This new combo achieved the lung function level 15.9% over the duo, Tez/Kalydeco (this must be their control) in the Ph.2 trial. This is not the end of story because the San Diego Lab discovered more potent potentiator and corrector than those in the above triple combos, and it will go to clinic soon. It will take a many many years' safety and efficacy data for healthcare providers to switch to a potential competitor's drug."
Big pharma could acquire $VRTX for $700?
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated VRTX announced data on the first patient from an ongoing phase I/II study evaluating its investigational cell-based therapy, VX-880 for the treatment of type I diabetes (T1D) with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. After 90 days of the single infusion of VX-880 at half the target dose along with immunosuppressive therapy, restoration of insulin production was observed.The first patient in the phase I/II study had a history of 40 years with T1D and was dependent on treatment with exogenous insulin. The patient had severe, potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes five times in one year prior to the start of treatment with VX-880. Data from the study showed that after 90 days of administration of VX-880, basal insulin production was restored. The treatment also restored glucose-responsive insulin production. The insulin production was measured by C-peptide levels. Fasting C-peptide was 280 pmol/L while stimulated C-peptide was 560 pmol/L at day 90 compared to undetectable levels at baseline.The blood glucose level, as measured by HbA1c, reduced from 8.6% at the baseline to 7.2% at day 90. The patient needed 34 units of insulin dose per day prior to the treatment with VX-880, which got reduced to an average dose of 2.9 units per day at day 90, reflecting a decrease of almost 91% in daily insulin requirement."
"That gives them the opportunity to move faster than gene therapies, with a simpler manufacturing approach that should avoid the CMC snafus that have bedeviled the leaders in gene therapy. Any stumble that may occur will have to play out in the spotlight — but the finish line is looming into view. And Jefferies’ Michael Yee sees big potential returns for Vertex:VRTX looks like it has a pot’l blockbuster in due course and a pot’l “curative” type gene editing drug which could be $1B type potential in the future (sickle cell has 10x more pts than beta thal). This program doesn’t get sufficient attention from VRTX holders mostly because Street is more enamored with the AAT Phase II, but this CRSP partnership should get more attention now."

"Value of $VRTX if $ABBV, $MRK, or $PFE purchased itBig pharma can benefit a lot if purchased Vertex Pharma. Vertex is treating about 50% of 83 K CF people in US, Canada, EU, and Australia. About 30 K of 83 K can benefit from Vertex medicines but they are not treated right now. Some of them will be treated in the future. Suppose that only 50% of 30K will reimburse for treatment in the next few years. This is a reasonable assumption. This 15 K will be added to 41.5 K people being treated now. This is a 36% increase. For Q2 $VRTX reported $3.11 for non-GAAP/share. In 2 to 3 years this will be boosted by 36%: 3.11 X 1.36 = $4.23/q/shr. This is an annual rate of almost $17. The big pharma listed above has a low 30's PE. Vertex has a good pipeline as well. The forward PE of the above pharma is more like above 35. The gives to the would-be buyer a whopping value of $595 (= $17 X 35 = $595) per share. Even if any paid $300/shr to the $VRTX shareholders, it gets greater than $76 billion (=($295/194)X50B) benefit. It looks very foolish not to grab this cash cow."

"It is not clear what this [next-gen] CF drug is:[[ ... At an investor presentation this past Tuesday, Kewalramani said that Vertex intended sometime this year to begin a Phase 3 trial of what she called a “next gen” cystic fibrosis drug, which could be more effective than its current products.

"Hi Third, * days ago your post:""Two collaborations between Vertex and Moderna are in late preclinical stages of development. The first collaboration is to deliver the mRNA coding CFTR to the lung airways lining cells, while the second collaboration involves a delivery of RNAs needed for CRISPR gene editing of genome in the lung airway cells. If the second approach can succeed in placing the CFTR gene into the correct location of DNA in the lung airway stem cells, the change will be permanent, and as far as the lung is concerned, it cures the CF. Management states that these drugs are only to help 10% of CF population who cannot be helped by oral drugs. However, if CRISPR-aided permanent cure is possible for the lung, this therapy can be used by all CF people, not just the 10% of the people.""Your last post which indicates that if CRISPER cure is possible it can be used for all CF people, does not bode well for VRTX. do you have a time table for how long it would take for such therapy, if at all, becomes available to CF patients? Any thoughts?"

An unusually thorough SA article on $VRTX came out this morning. I recommend everyone to read all of it. The writer's quote of analyst's estimate of CTX001 value (peak sale of 1.2B) is too conservative.

"There are a few reasons why Vertex needs Arbor’s technology. Nothing wrong with VX-880 or with CTX001 except that cultured islet cells invite immune response and CTX001 for SCD and TDT has a few competitions. Besides, $BEAM aims at a 2nd generation SCD treatment which could correct amino acid mutation in the hemoglobin directly without trying to produce fetal hemoglobin. BEAM does not have even any IND approval yet, but it is a good idea for VRTX to search for a perfect nuclease and transposase to for each indication. CRISPR/Cas9 was originally developed by bacteria to fend off phage virus invasion. Pioneers of CRISPR technologies noticed possible applications in human diseases because many human genetic or non-genetic diseases are caused by unwanted DNA segments which can be knocked out by CRISPR. But this can be only one half the story for many human applications. You may need to put back in a correct DNA sequence into the emptied spot. Bacteria perfected the process of ""digging out"" virus genome buried in their own, but this system alone cannot “knock-in” a desired sequence in human applications. This challenge is taken up by Arbor. They screen millions of protein systems a WEEK to find the best nuclease(to replace Cas9) and TRANSPOSASE for a particular application.This screening process is AI-assisted iteration; screen for hits, validate, and improve protein systems. Transposases are enzymes that can ""knock-in"" desired transgenes at the spot CRISPR dictates. Arbor also aims at replacing a whole defective gene with a corrected gene."
"When an investment house downgrades a stock hovering around its 52 week lows it is not because they think it is over valued, it is to drive the share price down as much as they can so their short seller clients can cover their position with max profit.

"What a collapse. Read technical analysis some time back discussing VRTX, stating it might need to fall to the low 170s range before recovering. That seemed very low at the time but VRTX price movement confirms that analysis. If so, it may be safe to buy at this level or a bit lower."
cant take the losses in share price much longer... If stock is 'broken' it may be wise to wait along the sidelines until it seems fixed again.

Motley keeps pushing VRTX but no one is listening. I wonder why!!
There is fundamental difference between what $VRTX/$CRSP collaboration is working on SCD/TDT treatment and what $FULC is trying to achieve. CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing method or improved version of it can fully cure TDT or SCD by deleting BCL11A gene permanently while $FULC company is trying to do is to inhibit EED to suppress the expression of the gene. CRISPR method is a permanent one time procedure while FULC method involves continuous supply of the drug because it does not alter the DNA piece BCL11A.

However, if CRISPR-aided permanent cure is possible for the lung, this therapy can be used by all CF people, not just the 10% of the people.https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-and-vertex-establish-new-collaboration-treat-cystic"

"TWO YEARS AGO, this company's stock was trading at these levels..... Hasn't ANYTHING meaningful happened with this company (in a positive nature).? Anything? exactly What?"
i dont think the problem with vertex is operational or competitors but the fact they dont distribute any cash to share holders or buy out anyone. no dividend while the FCF is 3 billion. revenue grows dubbel diget and will do this for years but a 3% dividend makes the stock worth holding for new investors.
What is coming next? I look forward to seeing the Phase 2A results of VX-147. We'll find out before and after the year's end. VX-147 is an orally taken small molecule drug that is only one to target the underlying cause of this kidney disease. There are 100K patients in the US and EU alone who can potentially benefit from the drug. CEO who is a kidney specialist said at the MS cc that she expected a high probability of success with the drug because it is a genetically validated target. She also said at the time that the drug was slowing disease progression (the trial is a open-labelled study). This is also a multi-billion dollar opportunity according to her. The disease is severe: 50% of people diagnosed will face kidney failure within 5 years.https://vertexvoices.vrtx.com/science/vertex-forward-exploring-apol1-mediated-kidney-diseases

still going down! where are all u people bragging about what a good deal U got at 190 ?
"Looking forward to JP Morgan in less than 4 weeks. It will be Leiden's last presentation as CEO, and Iexpect it will be an inspiring presentation of the successful business he has helped build during his tenure as CEO, and a positive note to bid adieu to the investors at the conference regarding the confidence he has in his replacement, and the path forward for continued growth and success in the VRTX R&D pipeline. Vertex will be providing clinical trial results in for three or four new promising innovative treatments that will provide new hope for patients with serious diseases with limited existing treatment options. The market continues to see VRTX as one of the most innovative and successful growth stories in biotech. (See Michael Yee's comments from the recent Marketwatch article published this past weekend.) Longs should continue to enjoy the ride. Happy Holiays to all."
"With all the supposedly Positive articles & Positive comments, -who keeps the selling pressure so high. This company's stock has been terrible, YET.... it seems everyone is touting it as a great buy and a great investment. Hummmm time will tell (i guess)"
"This weekend's Cover Story of Barron's is about [Medicine's Golden Age is Dawning].https://www.barrons.com/articles/medicine-healthcare-stocks-roundtable-51632527474?mod=hp_HEROOne participating in this Healthcare Roundtable suggested that currently undergoing biotech revolution is like the Industrial Revolution of 17th Century. I agree with the assessment. The very first wave of this revolution started when human genome was sequenced rapidly. The second wave of the revolution was started with manipulation of messenger RNA to create or silence protein production(as witnessed from RNAi or Covid19 vaccine), and the third wave was pioneered by gene therapy and gene-editing, and the most recent wave is the deployment of AI and machine learning in drug discovery. Though the participants of the Barron's roundtable discussion didn't mention $VRTX, the front runner of the two last waves is Vertex. Vertex and collaborator $CRSP are curing SCD and TDT patients(40 people received CTX001 are doing well, CEO said) far far ahead of other imitators (they haven't even started dosing). Vertex is the pioneer of gene-editing and also one of the pioneer in the use of AI, as is clear from Arbor collaboration. How else could Vertex discover a more potent potentiator and correctors than used in trikafta? Yes, Vertex has a triple combo drug which even surpasses VX-121/Tez/VX-561, which gives the sweat chloride level that CFTR gene carriers have. And I am confident that Vertex will discover drug candidates to treat AATD far better than VX-814 or VX-864 did. Also soon-to-be-announced VX-147 trial will succeed in treating APOL1 mediated kidney diseases(our CEO was a nephrologist)."
I hope they are saving up for something big.
Impressive volume Sell off is over
Press Release: Vertex to Present at the Morgan Stanley Virtual 19th Annual Global Healthcare Conference on September 15th
"Actions speak louder than words. Poor, incompetent leadership is expensive when it comes to shareholder value. This stock is bleeding profusely and their CEO has no clue how to turn it around ."
Lots of allegedly positive news on VRTX! Lots of sunny comments on this message board! There is an old saying “Follow the Money” ! If u follow the money this has been a sell for last year! In fact the SP has dropped dramatically in the face of all the positive commentary & much higher price targets! I am holding on till earnings! After that unless i see some upward movement I will no longer be a bag holder ! Piper Sandler can take that 323 target & put it where the sun don’t shine!
look like if Institutions are committed to push the market cap down to instigate a purchase. N one care anymore about CF . Less about deals w others pharmaceuticals . Neither phase 1/2 pipeline. Show m the money outside CF ! or Your MCap will suffer- meaning : you’ll become a Target due t an attractive value ( $30’s B ) . Alexion’ s reference
"This company has a fortress balance sheet, monopoly patents and compelling valuation relative to its growth prospects. This stock definitely belongs in one's long term portfolio."

It’s a stock stuck in quick sand. Look no further than the chairman’s role. Jeff Leiden has done a dismal job of leading this company through these tough times. No organic growth and very few license deals. He should have stayed in the CEO’s position and leave the visionary job to someone more qualified.
"Churchill Swartz & Associate voted the best fake and bakeshop worldwide, Bam."
Since the new CEO has taken over there has been one disaster after another and the stock price shows it well. She had billions in cash available to her and should have acquired 3-5 compounds in phase III and run with them.

done nothin than diving. South all the way. Makes me angry now after a year. One of my biggest position
"This is probably kind of a sore subject around her, but purely from a technical chart reading perspective, it really doesn't appear that this downtrend is going to reverse any time soon. As a matter of fact, speaking of a reversal, what that would involve for the most part is a HEAVY VOLUME CAPITULATION. Now if you were going to look at this from a fundamental perspective, to be honest, it doesn't actually look that much better, going by several widely accepted metrics. On the other hand, if you were to try and reasonably project earnings out ten years in the future, and then discount it back to the present day you might come up with a ""Fair Value"" at somewhere around DOUBLE the present price per share. Investors in this company have the advantage of a pretty large number of analyst coving the stock. More than 50 actually, and nearly half that many of them have stuck their neck out to provide somewhat of an actual consensus to that effect. I'm not pulling these numbers out of a hat. Now back to the negative: Nobody can REALLY predict the future, and particularly 10 whole years out. So that's where we stand. Ordinarily, the market itself has tried to predict the future, and the future has more actual bearing on the stock price than the past in a lot of cases. Unfortunately, there is presently a lot of uncertainty in this sector. There are a lot of unknown variables that could radically change the future at this particular point in time, if not always in this particular sector. Personally, I don't feel that I or anyone else commenting here could outguess a consensus of over 20 professional analysts on this issue, but it is MY money at stake, not theirs, in most cases. Having said all that, I really have no reason to mistrust these analysts, especially as a group. I DO specifically remember one in particular saying in no uncertain terms say that VRTX would be a particularly good stock load up on in the event of a market crash. Unfortunately, it seems, at the time I read that, I took it to mean that it would be a good thing to buy RIGHT NOW to PREPARE for a crash, lol!I guess it really doesn't matter at this point. I've learned the hard way to diversify, keep some powder dry and don't try and time the market. Realistically, I think us bagholders probably have at least a good 5 years ahead of us to confirm what the wise analysts are projecting, and possibly break even. At this point, the real opportunity will come in the chance of doubling down at a lower cost per share, and I think realistically, that opportunity might present itself around $100 to 130/share. I hope my thoughts on the subject don't trigger anyone. I didn't want to just come out of the blue with that, which is why I wrote out this expansive thesis on my thoughts first. No, I don't think the company is going to go broke anytime in the next ten years, but this is looking more and more like I'm going to be stuck riding the waves for quite a few more years before I'm able to eek out a profit, but going forward from there, judging from investments I've made in the past, where my patience wasn't quite as great as my stock picking abilities, this could turn out pretty good, if I live long enough!"
I see no reason or support before $120.
Bro...
Where are all the folks bragging about what a good deal they got on VRTX stock?
"I knew I should have sold my TR4 and bought lots more. Oh no wait I'm a bit premature, it's only up at what the shares cost me. Blast. I agree about it's annoying habit of yo-yoing. But serioulsy I'm still bullish. I was bullish on STMP and was rewarded amply. Should have bought the dip."
"This stock always makes its biggest moves in pre/after markets, but once the markets open, this bad boy always drops. Go figure"
Time for new leadership!
the share is completely under the control of speculators with WALL STREET. until they play enough growth will not be.
What is with this stock? Up and down like a yo-yo. No upward momentum at all.
"Kaftrio is given in the EU in combination with Kalydeco, another CFTR modulator developed and marketed by Vertex. The EC's decision to approve the therapy's label expansion follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a part of the European Medicines Agency"
I want to see at earnings if they are buying back stock ! They don’t pay a dividend so do something positive with the cash!
thoughts on the diabetes trial? this is huge right?
"As an MD and JD/LLM with many years of investment banking, I can't believe this is getting no upward movement. This stock is SOOOO undervalued and overdue for huge spike UP."
"Hope reversal is in the making, my 186$ looked so good a week ago..."
"(SEC ) should ban fake bidding completely ,"
Wow vertex is actually moving up for once
Leiden and the rest of this leadership group needs some pressure from the largest shareholders to start either making acquisitions or licensing deals. The status quo is wiping out shareholders !! This company is another example when you replace or promote the CEO and Chairman’s role to someone never before in that role you are rolling the dice. In this case it came up snake eyes …I’m selling all my shares and buying ENTA. Good luck to you all.
"Doesn’t VRTX seems like a good acquisition candidate, providing a strong lucrative niche to some other company?"
"It is indeed frustrating to see a stock price drop when you own it from a higher value… and this year long down trend has been a painful ride. But there are technicals that we can’t fight and ride along. The bottom is near. $165-170. After that, there are two obvious gaps to be filled, and the trend for the next 8-12 months should bring the stock north of $230."
"Review Article Published: 08 December 2020Type 1 diabetes mellitus as a disease of the β-cell (do not blame the immune system?) Bart O. Roep, Sofia Thomaidou, […]Arnaud Zaldumbide Nature Reviews Endocrinologyvolume 17, pages150–161 (2021)Cite this article 19k Accesses 28 Citations 47 Altmetric Metrics details AbstractType 1 diabetes mellitus is believed to result from destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in pancreatic islets that is mediated by autoimmune mechanisms. The classic view is that autoreactive T cells mistakenly destroy healthy (‘innocent’) β-cells. We propose an alternative view in which the β-cell is the key contributor to the disease. By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity. Finally, we synthesize a model (‘connecting the dots’) in which both β-cell stress and islet autoimmunity can be harnessed as targets for intervention strategies."
If it goes below 185 for extended period of time then some #$%$ is going on?..absolutely no reason this stock should be trading at these levels. The daily volume is so low?.easy to manipulate.
What will be the next catalyst and when can we expect a significant price change? Any upcommig data releases? (I am too lazy to research it myself)
"Range Bound now for basically 3 full months.... come on, let's break 1 way or another!"
Ark lnvestments yesterday sold 68k shares of VRTX
i like CRDF and TOMDF much better than vertex... early beginning plays each with huge upside potential and both recently bounced off 12 month lows with great news / results...
They need to give shareholders dividends.
"(VRTX) might hit $225.00 by Friday, Aug.20th, 2021 Booyah."
The more VRTX gets hyped by the media the more the price per share goes down. Shares are being dumped big time!
Thinking we need to start a VRTX bag holders club!!!! What a dooooog ? All the sunny projections from analysts & hot air on this board & this fleabag drops about every week! I wanna see at the next earning report how much stock they actually bought back & what changes to they making to bring this back from the dead!!!
"this month we have q3 numbers estimate is 1,84 billion and i am 95% sure we are going to destroy that estimate.we have had a lot of reimbursments in june with about 160 mil people in population with almost the same number of CF patients per 1000CF drugs are 1/3th cheaper in europe and healthcare for rare diseases is a lot better in america but still a significant marketthese patients where either just a couple of weeks/days in q2 numbers even when there are possibly thousands of new patients.this might also be the reason why some board members and insiders have been buying the stock and why they are doing a share buy back. i would be suprised if they have 1,9- 2 billion in revenue last quarter."
Hmm buyout coming
BUT CRAMER SAID THIS WAS A WINNNER!
"Rising bond yields could be another negative for VRTX shares.Due to the fact that a lot of VRTX shares' current value is predicated on projected FUTURE earnings being discounted back to the present at current INTEREST RATES. With interest rates rising, the present value of future assets would naturally be lower. That might help to explain why VRTX stock is still falling in a rising market. """"Higher interest rates tend to lower the current value of cash flows expected years down the road, relative to cash generated today."""""
The underlying numbers look good. Why is this stock under-performing?
"For What It's Worth: last month 2 insider Bought Shares, for a Total amount of roughly 5Million dollars....so THAT's a positive (I'd say). Would luv to see more of that stuff.!!"

Health Canada approves Vertex's Kalydeco in pediatric cystic fibrosis indicationHealth Canada has granted Marketing Authorization for Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX +1.0%) Kalydeco for use in certain children with cystic fibrosis (CF).The approval allows for the use of the drug in children as young as four months of age who have at least one of certain specific mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.The label update is based on data from a cohort in the 24-week Phase 3 open-label safety study (ARRIVAL) consisting of six children with CF ages four months to less than six months who have eligible gating mutations.
So many Bulls ! So little price movement upwards!
