"How serious is potential competitive threat from Abbv's CF drugs?A very pessimistic view to this question was the basis for Matt Harrison's (of MS) downgrade of $VRTX about a month ago. Since then, CEO refuted Matt's view very well in the conf. call of MS on Sept. 15.She said that Trikafta alone already set a high bar in both safety and efficacy for any potential competitor. No oral drug can surpass the sweat chloride level of CFTR carriers, but Trikafta already achieved the carrier level of sweat chloride. Furthermore, for the long term Trikafta achieved a milestone no other drugs could: two year data showed that there was no decline in the lung function. Trikafta is not just slowing the decline, but stopping the decline. For safety Vertex already has ten thousand patients' safety data.As if that is not enough, Vertex is going to run the ph.3 trial for VX-121/Tez/VX-561 combo soon. This new combo achieved the lung function level 15.9% over the duo, Tez/Kalydeco (this must be their control) in the Ph.2 trial. This is not the end of story because the San Diego Lab discovered more potent potentiator and corrector than those in the above triple combos, and it will go to clinic soon. It will take a many many years' safety and efficacy data for healthcare providers to switch to a potential competitor's drug."
Lots of allegedly positive news on VRTX! Lots of sunny comments on this message board! There is an old saying “Follow the Money” ! If u follow the money this has been a sell for last year! In fact the SP has dropped dramatically in the face of all the positive commentary & much higher price targets! I am holding on till earnings! After that unless i see some upward movement I will no longer be a bag holder ! Piper Sandler can take that 323 target & put it where the sun don’t shine!
Why isn't this rocketing? A diabetic patient started to produce insulin again and no longer needs diabetes medications!!!!

Today market rallies huge and this I can’t even participate. Ceo needs to go or sell the company.
"Vertex's VX-880 achieves efficacy in Type 1 diabetes patient, says Piper Sandler - Piper Sandler analyst Edward TenthoVertex's VX-880 achieves efficacy in Type 1 diabetes patient, says PiperSandler - Piper Sandler analyst Edward Tenthoff reiterates an Overweightrating and $323 price target on Vertex Pharmaceuticals after the companyannounced positive data for the first patient dosed with VX-880, apotentially curative, stem-cell derived pancreatic islet cell therapy forType 1 Diabetes. A single infusion at half the target dose resulted inrestoration of insulin production and improved glucose control with HbA1cdecrease from 8.6% to 7.2%, with 91% decrease in daily insulin use from 34 toonly 2.9 units/day at day 90 from baseline, Tenthoff tells investors in aresearch note. While early, this result shows that stem-cell therapy cantreat T1D patients, Tenthoff adds."
"With all the supposedly Positive articles & Positive comments, -who keeps the selling pressure so high. This company's stock has been terrible, YET.... it seems everyone is touting it as a great buy and a great investment. Hummmm time will tell (i guess)"
"Strong support, flawless balance sheets. Room for growth maybe limited but the stock is beaten hard"
VX-880 is a $5 billion opportunity on its 'naked' cell form alone.
I didn't think these gains were going to hold. Just another bounce in the middle of a long established down trend. How low this things goes is anybody's guess.
The more VRTX gets hyped by the media the more the price per share goes down. Shares are being dumped big time!
What is coming next? I look forward to seeing the Phase 2A results of VX-147. We'll find out before and after the year's end. VX-147 is an orally taken small molecule drug that is only one to target the underlying cause of this kidney disease. There are 100K patients in the US and EU alone who can potentially benefit from the drug. CEO who is a kidney specialist said at the MS cc that she expected a high probability of success with the drug because it is a genetically validated target. She also said at the time that the drug was slowing disease progression (the trial is a open-labelled study). This is also a multi-billion dollar opportunity according to her. The disease is severe: 50% of people diagnosed will face kidney failure within 5 years.https://vertexvoices.vrtx.com/science/vertex-forward-exploring-apol1-mediated-kidney-diseases
"TWO YEARS AGO, this company's stock was trading at these levels..... Hasn't ANYTHING meaningful happened with this company (in a positive nature).? Anything? exactly What?"
"this month we have q3 numbers estimate is 1,84 billion and i am 95% sure we are going to destroy that estimate.we have had a lot of reimbursments in june with about 160 mil people in population with almost the same number of CF patients per 1000CF drugs are 1/3th cheaper in europe and healthcare for rare diseases is a lot better in america but still a significant marketthese patients where either just a couple of weeks/days in q2 numbers even when there are possibly thousands of new patients.this might also be the reason why some board members and insiders have been buying the stock and why they are doing a share buy back. i would be suprised if they have 1,9- 2 billion in revenue last quarter."
"It is indeed frustrating to see a stock price drop when you own it from a higher value… and this year long down trend has been a painful ride. But there are technicals that we can’t fight and ride along. The bottom is near. $165-170. After that, there are two obvious gaps to be filled, and the trend for the next 8-12 months should bring the stock north of $230."
thoughts on the diabetes trial? this is huge right?
"Barrons' is again bullish:https://www.barrons.com/articles/healthcare-stocks-undervalued-screen-51634750556[[...The company’s core cystic fibrosis franchise remains strong, however, and analysts haven’t lost faith. Earlier this week, Vertex announced positive data on the first patient treated in a Phase 1/2 trial of a new stem cell-derived therapy to treat Type 1 diabetes. Of the 27 tracked by FactSet who cover the stock, 20 rate it a Buy or Overweight, while five rate it a Hold and two rate it a Sell.Their average target price of $260.52 suggests a 41.9% gain from the stock’s recent price of $183.62.“We continue to think the stock is not currently pricing-in any credit to the pipeline, and credit is currently being given only to the base business,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note out Oct. 14."
No reason for this stock to be down. This is the future. Gevo has many deals with big companies like chevron and bp. This stock will be at $20 soon $ped $vrtx $prog
Is this the most undervalued pharma or what?
did they annouce their earnings?
