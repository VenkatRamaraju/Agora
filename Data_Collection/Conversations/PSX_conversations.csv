"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"

"San Francisco gasoline price surges as storm disrupts area refineriesOct. 25, 2021 5:55 PM ETSpot gasoline prices in the San Francisco area are poised to hit record highs as record rainfall caused disruptions at two northern California refineries, Bloomberg reports.Physical gasoline prices surged $0.125 to the strongest premium over Nymex gasoline futures since mid-August, according to the report, as traders expect supplies will tighten in the days ahead.Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) Richmond refinery reportedly shut multiple units on Sunday with elevated flaring observed, and PBF Energy's (NYSE:PBF) Martinez refinery experienced an operational upset, according to a regulatory filing.Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) Benicia refinery already was down from the start of the month due to scheduled maintenance.Retail prices in the city were averaging $4.727/gal today, according to AAA, just a penny short of a record high set in 2012.The National Weather Service says the heavy rain and winds along the West Coast were caused by a ""bomb cyclone"" and an ""atmospheric river.""#MPC, #PSX, #HFC"

"Never let it be said that I only post positive articles on refiners""Refiners Have Gotten a Boost from the Power Crunch. It Won’t Last.""Barron’s Oct. 12, 2021 #MPC #PSXOil refiners are heading into earnings season on a strong run. The pandemic is easing in much of the world, leading to higher demand for gasoline and aviation fuel. The natural gas shortage that’s causing gas prices to rise around the world is causing some gas-users to switch to oil products for generating electricity, further boosting demand. And those trends are boosting the bottom line: Refiners are likely to post their first quarter of solidly positive earnings since the pandemic started. The stocks of most U.S.-based refiners are up 10% to 20% in the past month. Phillips 66 (ticker: PSX) is leading the pack, up 23%. Valero Energy (VLO) has risen 19%, HollyFrontier (HFC) is up 13%, and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is up 11%. “It makes for a good short-term view,” said Citigroup analyst Prashant Rao in an interview.But the medium and longer term isn’t as rosy for refiners. There are at least three negative trends that could slow their rebound, and even send the stocks in reverse.The most immediate danger is that high prices for oil products will start to erode demand for those products. High oil prices could cause people to use less of it, or government policies meant to curb high costs could force changes in behavior.“Right now there’s a very, very positive environment,” Rao said. “But there’s some fears around what happens later in the winter.” Another problem is that a quirk in the market that has historically helped U.S. refiners isn’t helping them quite as much anymore. There has been a spread between the international price of crude oil and the U.S. price for several years. The international price, Brent, has traded at higher levels than the U.S. one, West Texas Intermediate, or WTI. That’s because there was an oversupply of U.S. oil. U.S. refiners were able to buy U.S. crude at low prices and process it into products that they sent overseas, making a wider margin than their international competitors.But U.S. producers have been pumping out less oil this year because they’re more focused on fixing their balance sheets than drilling new wells. The spread between Brent and WTI is now about $3, versus $6 two years ago.The third challenge is potentially an even more consequential and long-lasting one. More refineries are being built around the world, at a rate that is outpacing demand for oil products, Rao said. The pandemic may have slowed oil demand, but it didn’t slow refinery projects enough. So even as refiners work to get back to their prior operating levels, new competitors are getting close to opening.“Because you lost a year of oil demand, you had too many refiners in the world,” he said. “And now there’s new refineries in the Middle East and China coming on top of that. You’re going to have excess capacity for multiple years is what it looks like.”Refining capacity is likely to outpace demand by 1 million to 2 million barrels a day in the next two to three years, Rao said. As in any industry, too much capacity hurts prices, and the analyst expects refiner profitability to “take a step down from where it was before the pandemic.”Rao still likes some names. In particular, Valero still has particularly profitable operations, and is among the furthest along in transitioning to renewable fuels, including renewable diesel. In the next two to three years, about a quarter of its cash flows are likely to come from non-petroleum sources, he said."

"Thank goodness for pipelines!Canadian oil exports to the U.S. jump with new pipeline startupBy Bloomberg Thursday, October 7, 2021, 6:38 AM MDTOil barrels Source: iStock/Guven PolatCanadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to the highest volume since the start of the year thanks in part to the startup of a long-delayed Canadian pipeline. Weekly oil deliveries from America’s northern neighbour reached 4.04 million barrels day, the most since January, according to the Energy Information Administration. It’s only the third time the U.S. has imported more than 4 million barrels a day of Canadian crude since the agency began compiling weekly data in 2010.It’s likely these increased flows will be the new norm mainly because of the expanded Line 3, said Elisabeth Murphy, ESAI Energy LLC upstream analyst for North America. In fact, weekly volumes should start to average closer to 3.7-3.8 million barrels a day from here, from current levels of around 3.5 million, she added. New course on scope 2 and scope 3 emissions that are generated due to the production of oil and gas products.Click hereThe additional barrels from Canada come as a relief to U.S. refiners struggling with less supply from OPEC+, shrinking imports from Latin America, and more recently, the loss of about 30 million barrels of Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida. Gulf Coast refineries have increasingly been pulling from Canada to offset the crude production in the Gulf of Mexico that remains shut since Hurricane Ida swept through over a month ago, said Shirin Lakhani, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group.Last week, Enbridge Inc. started its new Line 3 crude pipeline after years of delays. It can transport 760,000 barrels a day of heavy and light oil, nearly double the size of the old line it replaced.#mpc, #psx, #hfc"
"I think something to take into consideration is that we don't need O&G prices to go up every day to push up the PPS.

"Aug 30 – Oil and Gas Journal – selected paragraphs only. #MPC #PSX While several operators confirmed undertaking precautionary shutdowns of many refineries and petrochemical plants ahead of the hurricane’s arrival, updates regarding current operations at the sites were slow coming on Monday, presumably amid widespread electrical outages in the region As of 9:00 p.m. CST on Aug. 28, Phillips 66 confirmed via a statement to the company’s website that it had completed a safe and orderly shutdown of operations and released all personnel from work at its 255,600-b/d Alliance refinery in Belle Chasse, La. Further updates regarding the status of the refinery, however, have yet to be released.Other major operators in the region remained silent regarding the operational status of or precautionary measures taken at their Louisiana manufacturing sites.

"An open letter to PSX % VLO shareholdersI am writing you in total dismay on your quarterly results. For several quarters you have had negative returns which Covid-19 could be blamed. This last quarter, you finally returned with a profitable quarter. This however wasn’t enough to pay the shareholders dividend. The main culprit was the refining of gas, diesel and jet fuel.To the shareholder, myself included, the problem lies in a business model that is broken as evidenced by all refiners exhibiting losses or minimal profits. This is happening while almost all producers have recovered in price. The wholesale price of crude hasn’t been this high since Sept. 2018. The Dow was at 25,000 and we are at 35,000 now. PSX was approx. 118 per share and VLO was approx. 113 per share to name a few. These stocks are now PSX=64 and VLO=62. If PSX and VLO followed the Dow which is up 40%, we should be at 165 for PSX and and 158 for VLO. Instead of being up 40% as the DOW is, were trading at 54% of Sept 1018 value. Last, when comparing prices to the current DOW increase to our present price, were trading at 39% of relative value. To top this off, American airlines is asking pilot’s to conserve fuel due to unavailability in certain areas.Being a shareholder with numerous share shareholder, I am requesting you immediately change this business model. First and foremost increase refining prices like almost every company in America which are exhibiting record profits. Then we could discus curtailing all bonuses and stock options for senior management. This could be followed with a 50% pay cut to the CEO, CFO, and all senior management relating to departments that result in losses per quarter. Next, all business related travel should be curtailed. If mandatory it should be done flying coach on the airlines. Last, the board of directors should meet with a Zoom type meeting and curtail their lavish expenses of quarterly meetings."

Distillate inventories dropped 1.7 million barrels in the week. Distillate demand was stronger than last weekProduction of gasoline last week averaged 9.3 million bpd, which compared with 10.1 million bpd a week earlier.

"Americans Keep Driving Despite Virus Concernsby Bloomberg|Jeffrey Bair|Thursday, August 26, 2021Americans Keep Driving Despite Virus ConcernsAmericans are still buying up fuel to make the most of summer travel despite a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks.(Bloomberg) -- Americans are still buying up fuel to make the most of summer travel despite a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks, allaying fears a resurgent virus would choke off the oil market’s remarkable recovery this year.Fuel consumption, measured by the amount of gasoline sent to the market, last week rose to the highest level since the end of July. The figures defy expectations that Covid-19 concerns would keep more Americans at home and drive down demand.The consumption boost offers encouragement to an industry bedeviled by the volatile recovery from the pandemic. Delta’s spread has put thousands in intensive care, prompting worries that summer travel would fizzle out well before Labor Day, which is the traditional end of the season. Tracking those concerns, oil’s stellar year-to-date rally cooled in the first half of August.“Still a lot of Americans are willing to get out and live their lives in the midst of Covid,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities.Americans’ penchant for hitting the road is also showing up in stockpiles. Gasoline supply in the region including New York last week dropped to its lowest in nearly four years. Cash-market prices in New York Harbor and Houston increased Wednesday in response, along with futures. The spread of gasoline over crude oil rose more than 12%.Despite the uncertainty in the market, U.S. oil refiners have on the whole navigated the latest twists and turns with success, Yawger said.“More often than not, they get that math wrong in a normal year,” he said.#MPC, #PSX, #HFC"

"MS --3Q EPS Preview: Rising Tide -- Oct 18, 2021 #MPC #PSXIndustry indicators strengthening as gasoline and diesel demand remain robust; jet is starting to look healthier. Demand data points since our launch have been strong. Jet fuel, the laggard to this point, has seen demand trend closer to the 5Y average, while diesel demand has been exceptionally strong. Product cracks are reflecting these improvements, with both diesel and jet cracks moving back towards their pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile, gasoline cracks have come down somewhat vs. our prior deck, but net-net, our price deck for 2022 has moved materially higher (~$2-3/bbl). Regionally, Midwest and Midcon cracks have strengthened the most vs. our prior update, generally resulting in more significant revisions for inland-oriented refiners like MPC and HFC. We do not expect the market will fully pay for these high prices on the curve right now, but we do think it will nonetheless reward beats-and-raises across the group this quarter.Picks into earnings and what we are watching: We are generally in line with consensus in 3Q, so our tactical picks are focused on revisions to 4Q21 and 2022 — we expect the largest positive near-term revisions out of MPC and VLO on the large cap side, and DK and PBF among the small/mid caps. Meanwhile, we see more limited near-term revisions to PSX and HFC. We expect the overall demand recovery will be front and center, but beyond this, biofuels have been the most topical point in our investor conversations. Based on the current project pipeline, there is growing concern that the industry is already set to overbuild biofuels capacity, but there are potential mitigating factors on both the demand (more states adopting Low Carbon Fuel Standards) and supply side (project slippage/cancellation). MPC and HFC will likely have the most attention on their projects, as MPC has yet to share a fully-loaded budget and HFC is currently running a bit over budget vs. initial guidance. We expect updates on Hurricane Ida's impact will be given, but only see PSX's Alliance facility as at risk of serious investment need, or potential sale/shutdown.Raising estimates and price targets on higher price deck. As discussed above, our average cracks are ~$2-3/bbl higher in 2022. We are risking our capture assumptions somewhat, and assume a certain degree of multiple compression on these high values, as we do not expect the market to fully capitalize these earnings without global oil demand data points on a universally firmer footing. Nonetheless, we raise our 2022 EBITDA forecasts by ~12%, with HFC, PBF, and VLO benefitting most. Our median PT is higher by 14%. WHAT'S CHANGED?

"Gas Prices May Keep Rising After Labor Day. Blame Hurricane Ida -- Barron’s 9/2/21 #MPC #PSXLabor Day weekend traditionally signals the conclusion of the U.S. summer driving season, but it may not mark the end of the peak period for gasoline prices, which stand near their highest since 2014.Atlantic storm Ida, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 29, led to the shutdown of some key Gulf Coast refinery operations, and it’s still not clear when those may fully resume.On Wednesday, Entergy (ticker: ETR), which provides power for states including Louisiana and Mississippi, said it would take time to fully restore power given significant damage across the region. The Wall Street Journal reported it could take weeks to resume refinery operations due to widespread power outages.· The disruption comes at a time of increased travel, and as gasoline consumption continues to recover from the effects of Covid restrictions on the economy.Gasoline demand has been strong over this summer, at around 3.5% below 2019 levels, says Ken Robinson, market research manager at workforce management and reimbursement platform Motus. Travel volume data suggest that people “remain more comfortable driving than flying.”U.S. motor gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, was at 9.5 million barrels per day on average over the four weeks ended Aug. 27, up from 8.9 million barrels per day the same period a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration. For roughly the same period in 2019, implied demand was at 9.7 million barrels per day.Gasoline may still have room to rise as Robinson expects Ida, which affected offshore wells, ports, refineries and pipelines, to “drive gas prices to their 2021 peak.” He estimates a potential, but temporary, five- to nine-cent increase in prices due to the storm that would likely ease off by early October “at the latest.”Retail gasoline prices have already inched higher following the storm, with the average national price at $3.174 a gallon on Sept. 1, up from the week-earlier average of $3.147, according to AAA. Reformulated gasoline futures haven’t climbed over the past seven days but at $2.11, gained nearly 76% from 52 weeks ago.Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at travel and navigation app GasBuddy, predicts an even larger price impact from the storm. Ida may lead to a five- to 15-cent per gallon rise in retail gasoline prices, he says, and a rise at the top end of that range would mark a new peak for prices this year. The worst-case scenario would be several weeks of power outages at refineries that lead to a retail gasoline price spike of more than 15 cents, he says.Either way, the potential for more disruptions remains since Atlantic hurricane season remains far from over. The season officially ends on Nov. 30 and the National Hurricane Center shows three more weather systems brewing in the Atlantic basin.Gasoline demand traditionally slows down after Labor Day, and prices for the fuel typically start to decline, says Andrew Gross, a spokesman for AAA. With the increasing Covid case numbers, he said AAA would expect prices to decrease.However, the hurricane season stands as an important “caveat that could spike gas prices,” he says. The impact of a significant storm like Ida could be “felt for weeks in terms of regional spikes in gas prices due to demand, infrastructure damage, and transportation issues,” says Gross.With prices so close to the year’s high, it wouldn’t take much to reach a new peak. In early August, gasoline prices reached $3.19 a gallon, the highest in seven years, according to Gross.It’s likely that while gasoline prices may ease in the post-Ida period, they will probably remain above $3 a gallon through early fall, he says."

"Off topic -- There are many in the US and Europe who want their citizens to sacrifice something in order to reduce emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.While we fret about burning oil and gas, coal futures have surged to a record high of $210 per metric ton, coming from $83 at the end of April. While dealing with electricity shortages, China has returned to burning coal... but is now vowing to achieve emissions standards and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. That's a good target date because everyone involved will be dead. This obviously raises some questions about the value of US efforts to promote ""clean"" energy. #MPC #PSX"
"OT -- Goldman Cools on Conoco But Likes 8 Other Oil Stocks -- Barron’s Oct 11, 2021 #MPC #PSX""The price of oil keeps rising, and the stocks of oil companies with it. Now, some analysts think the strategy of how to play the rebound is changing, too.For much of the past two years, investors and analysts have been focused on which oil companies can keep their costs down and send more of their profits back to investors as dividends and share buybacks. That’s led to more companies reducing their drilling budgets, paying off debts and slowing down plans to explore for new oil deposits.But there’s a counterargument to that strategy.There’s evidence now that demand for oil and gas isn’t going away in the near term, and the next few years will actually be characterized by high prices and underinvestment. That’s why Saudi Arabia is investing in expanding its production capacity to 13 million barrels a day from 12 million, even as U.S. and European oil firms slim down and reduce production. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta thinks that investors ought to consider companies that have access to long-term sources of oil and gas. Mehta picked eight of those companies as potential investments that can pay off over time as oil prices stay high amid a supply shortage.Goldman forecasts that the world will use 106 million barrels of oil per day in 2030, versus assumptions from European oil companies that demand will be around 100 million barrels. The eight stocks should return 18% in the next year, on average, Mehta predicts.Hess (ticker: HES) owns a stake in a major oil project off the coast of Guyana in partnership with ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chinese company CNOOC (883Hong Kong) that is expected to produce considerable amounts of oil for the next decade. Mehta expects the company to increase its cash flow by 15% a year through 2030, from $10 per share this year to $30 in 2030. He sees shares rising to $106 from a recent $92.Exxon’s Guyana project, and its refining, chemicals and liquefied natural gas divisions give it one of the strongest asset bases in Big Oil, according to Mehta. He sees shares rising to $68 from a recent $62.50.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) has one of the largest positions in the Permian Basin that Mehta expects to pay dividends for years — literally and figuratively. Pioneer has a variable dividend policy that could offer investors a dividend yield of 11% in 2022, Mehta estimates. He sees shares rising to $213 from a recent $196.Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been held back for the past couple of years because it added substantial debt when it bought competitor Anadarko Petroleum. But investors may be overlooking the strength of its resource base in the U.S. and Middle East, as well as its chemicals division, Mehta asserts. He sees shares rising to $40 from a recent $34.Small-cap Kosmos Energy (KOS) has promise because of an offshore natural gas project in West Africa that it’s constructing with BP (BP), Mehta writes. It’s expected to start service in the second half of 2023. He sees shares rising to $4 from a recent $3.30.Mehta also likes three Canadian oil companies — Cenovus (CVE), Suncor (SU) and Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ). He thinks they own resources that should pump out oil for years, and deserve more attention from American investors. Mehta has become less positive on ConocoPhillips (COP), though. He downgraded his rating to Neutral from Buy based on the company’s outperformance in recent months. It’s up 73% since his February upgrade, versus 15% for the S&P 500. He sees 4% total return for the stock in the next year, less than other oil stocks."

"WtiJust hit a 52 week high again￼!psx cop Mro,"
"This MLP was just a tax shelter that stopped being advantages. Just rolling the assets they gifted to PSXP back when they formed it, back into PSX…and getting all the benefit instead of only half."
PSX is now planning to repair and restore operations at its' Alliance refinery. This may be bad news for other refiners but a positive statement about management's view of future refining demand. Repairs will take several months. It is unclear as to whether they still plan to sell it. #VLO #MPChttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/phillips-66-psx-to-carry-out-repairs-at-alliance-refinery-2021-10-04
Is the acquisition good or bad for PSX ?
"MS 9/29 paper - Feedback on Our Launch & What's Changed (Highlights only)Following our initiation, our investor conversations suggest a marked preference for producers vs. refiners, though MPC is a popular holding. The largest development since our launch has been increasing clarity on biofuels policy, which alleviates near-term RINs pressure, but will drive LT uptake.Reminder of our thesis — bullish sector outlook on oil demand recovery, low valuations. What's happened since our launch? The market has moved into a relatively ""riskon"" mindset over the past few days in light of major supply constraints across key commodities, driving the R&M group higher in sympathy with the broader Energy sector. Valuation remains compelling, in our view. Market-wide fundamentals have been mixed. Crack spreads have softened somewhat as most refineries restarted shortly following Hurricane Ida, while crude oil production was more meaningfully impacted. Importantly, though, product-specific dynamics have been moving in line with our thesis (strengthening jet/diesel pricing, gasoline more stagnant). Demand data points from weekly DOE figures have been solid, largely on robust diesel demand. Our focus remains on data points that point to the path forward in 2022, and here, we continue to watch COVID case trends, which have shown signs of the Delta wave plateauing abroad and declining in the S , and broader mobility measures, which generally point to continued recovery in transportation activity. The two largest changes since our launch were on the biofuels front. First, the draft budget reconciliation language released by the House Ways & Means Committee would provide a meaningful tailwind for biofuels producers through the end of the decade. We detailed the impact on sustainable aviation fuel in particular here, but also note that the potential extension of the $1.00/gal renewable diesel blender's tax credit is a major tailwind for producers (most exposed right now: VLO, with HFC and MPC next). Second, Reuters reported that the EPA has recommended meaningfully reduced blending requirements for the 2020 and 2021 Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO). This has caused Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing to fall materially, effectively lowering the cost refiners face to offset their petroleum-based fuels production. The market has traded this relatively fairly, in our view, with refiners outperforming biofuels producers, andespecially those like PBF who have explicitly stated that they have not been purchasing RINs at elevated prices. Long term, the direction of travel is clear, though US biofuels policies and Low Carbon Fuel Standards are likely to increasingly favor biofuels production. Refiners without a meaningful biofuels strategy will likely face lower multiples and, potentially, more pressure on cash flows. #MPC #PSX"
"If you think this is good, wait until the pensioners start to (or are allowed to) return. There is too much money to be made in this sector. Once the first domino falls, the rest will rush to follow suit...they'll have to, as the ROI will be that good. All of us early investors will be sitting pretty..."
"Interesting to note that Q2,2021 compared to Q2,2020 -internal-combustion-engines still outsold EVs including hybrids, plug in's & regular EVs by 4 million cars. This stock has a $0.90 dividend. It will be interesting to see how the engineers mount the solar panels on the roof of the EV. so they can go fast enough to turn the wind turbines mounted on the trunk!"
"PSX reported net income for Q3 of $402 million, or 91 cents per share, compared with a loss of $799 million, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier. CC is at noonQ3 results included a $1.3 billion impairment of the Alliance Refinery, as well as $12 million of pension settlement expense and $10 million of hurricane-related costs. Adjusted for one-time expenses, PSX earned $1.4 billion.Midstream, Chemicals, and Specialties businesses all reported strong earnings and represent the bulk of PSX Q3 profits."
closing green today is a good sign
"Historically speaking, it looks like the divvy announcement should be coming any day now. Does anyone know if they have ambitions of becoming a dividend achiever? If so they would need to raise the divvy this quarter. Any thoughts?"
So they can increase dividend by 25%?
As bad a day I can remember. Stocks fluctuate.
"Made a great deal of money on PSX. Don't get out yet, $100 is on the way."
Made two buys this year. One at $52 and then at $64. I am a happy camper. When there is blood in the water it is time to buy!!
between psx and psxp? Thanks
"Very nice consolidation this week after the massive runup in the previous 2 to 3 weeks. All poised for another major leg up. This will be a $90 ~ $100 stock come Christmas so those who have missed the boat previously should consider jumping on. If you think you missed the runup, there is more room to go on this one.I do see PSX heading towards $120 in the next 12 months so that is another 50% increase from today."
"This may set-up further consolidation for PSX as they will fully own PSXP in early 2022. Like others have hoped or guessed, could PSX be merged or acquired by CVX or COP. A year ago I wasn't thinking along those lines, but it makes lots of sense looking out into the near future. Stay tune"
"STOCK is worth $85-$90. I'll collect the near 5% divy before giving shares away. Assure you $250k in the bank returns u .28%! Like Japan, U.S. rates will be peanuts for decades to come as Q.E. is here to stay! Soon these COAL powered EVs are going to be revealed as equal polluting cars!"
Selling could be over tomorrow
Took a small position this morning...always one of my fav companies.
Ouch.
"Bought a bit more, hope to see 110"
"Tighter supplies drive Asian gasoline margins higherPublished date: 26 October 2021Firmer regional demand, refinery disruptions and reduced Chinese supplies have all combined to propel Asian gasoline margins to their highest level since December 2015.The Asian gasoline margin, or the Argus 92R Singapore gasoline price against Ice Brent crude, has increased to $16.91/bl, the highest level since 14 December 2015 when it was $17.42/bl.Margins had already been on the rise since the end of September with reduced shipments from key supplier China. But the supply tightness has been exacerbated by a sharp increase in spot buying from Indonesia and India.#MPC, #HFC, #PSX"
Wti and Brent both above $70. Hoping for strong third quarter finish.
Anyone can enlighten me is psx has further upside potential?
"PSX holders have a right to be upset. In addition to the current price action, they are going to get penalized twice for the ex-dividend date drop. Once on October 28 (today, in sympathy with PSXP), and again on November 16 (PSX's ex dividend date). Possible that ""double penalty"" will also adversely impact PSXP. PSXP cancelled their conference call. In the past, questions regarding PSXP that were asked during PSX conference call were not answered. PSX would state the questions were not of material relevance, or defer to the easy out (we can only speak about PSX operations, PSXP is their own entity). Well, if the ex-dividend date(s) become a double negative, this creates an adverse material impact on all parties. As such, it is absolutely permissible to be discussed on the PSX conference call tomorrow, and it should be. Just putting an observation out there, in case it may benefit others..."
"The cash flow must be outstanding. According to the recent news about the raise in the dividend, the company announced an early repayment of 500 million dollars of debt and a total repayment this year of 1 billion. I am hoping that with that cash flow we might get a real surprise on earnings exceeding all expectations. I intend to hold my shares through the earnings announcement and maybe payment of the dividend."
"Best to remain calm, collect the nice dividend and watch this company continue shed some properties (assets), invest in new ones (diversify), and realize the huge demand thats to come for their existing products over the next 2 qtrs .. long term i see a company with the ability to profit from the current energy needs & future trends that will take much time to be the norm. Also as Oil demand goes crazy, their friendly relationship with ConocoPhillps will be an incredible value for refining costs .. Spin-off with fringe benefit$"

Strong headwinds on the horizon...
"(Bloomberg, 9/10/21) -- Phillips 66 may idle a New Orleans-area refinery that suffered so much damage during Hurricane Ida that repairs may be too costly, according to people familiar with the operation.Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland is scheduled to visit the Alliance refinery in the suburb of Belle Chasse, Louisiana, next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Company spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there’s no operational update or timeline for restarting the facility.The refinery, which can process more than 250,000 barrels of crude a day, was shut on Aug. 28, the day before Isa slammed into southeast Louisiana with ferocious winds and drenching rains. A 9-foot wall of water punched a hole in the refinery’s protective levee and inundated the plant.The damages may complicate Phillips 66’s efforts to find a buyer for an asset it was trying to unload before the storm because of “market conditions and the evolving energy landscape.” #VLO, #MPC"
I posted Q3 indicative crack spreads for VLO and MPC on those pages. PSX does not release refining market data. The numbers may still be interesting to refining investors.
All I can say is Nice!
Somebody did not care for the purchase of psxp. 7% drop yesterday and AH.X-div in 3 weeks.What’s the catch?
