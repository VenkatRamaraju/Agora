"One of the best stock in the market. It's the best in investment banks, and absolutely no substitute. It makes very good money even in the pandemic and will make more money after the pandemic. It's a cash cow. At this kind of low PE plus dividend, GS is a gift."

"GS will go up to a new high soon. It proves the capability of making big money in any environments evidenced by the 3nd Q earning report. At this low PE plus nice dividend and fast growth rate, GS is one of the best stocks in terms of performance and safety to invest. Do miss the opportunity, good luck!"
