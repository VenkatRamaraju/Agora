WATCH THE NEWS ON CNBC LET IT RIDE BECAUSE GS WILL BE OVER 375.00 TODAY AND 380.00 TOMORROW
It looks like Goldman may close under 405 today.
What is the level of exposure to China's changing finance policy? Does anyone really care??
"MANIPULATION BY GS DESK,REPORTED TO THE SEC"
of course you will blow out earnings when there is nonstop money printing
"Unusual Options Alert (GS) Call At The Ask $350.00 Exp Date July 23, 2021 Open Interest 52,063"
"Personally I don‚Äôt own any GS, I know they will smash earnings but I am more curious of what happens next, because that next will dictate upcoming pattern, this stock trades sideways so I am assuming a sharp drop, good luck to you all"
As long as you bought below 270 you will be fine.
SHORTS HAD A VERY SMALL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WITH ALL THE BILLIONS OF SHARES BOUGHT THEY ARE MADE TO COVER SO MUCH QUICKER BECAUSE THE PRICE IS RISING EVERY SECOND
SOFI to the moon! Steven Weiss comment on Robinhood‚Äôs IPO - RT @stephenLweiss: Why would I own $HOOD at egregious valuation when I could own $GS $MS at much lower valuation or $SOFI w/better biz model & superior mgt. Bottom line: RH is a brokerage firm trying to masquerade as a tech company. I'm not buying it. Make your own decision!
GS is down 6 days in a row. Anyone has any clue why it is doing so?
betting on blowout earnings & guidance!
"I would encourage newcomers to spend a few months developing a solid understanding of why Cryptocurrency is different. It's a revolution and it‚Äôs a money system that is beyond the control of any one or group of people and we‚Äôve never had anything like that before.

Goldman Sachs guys know how to trade ... you have to invest in them
"I own a lot of shares and GS has always made me money, earnings will be a blow out and I expect GS to go over 400.00 tomorrow and then pull back to 395.00 by thursday maybe"
"The recent pullback is a great buying opportunity, IMHO"
Sell high buy low...Thats the golden rule of investing....Upside risk here is nilDownside is huge as fed cuts stimulus and retail sales fall.Will you be  snookered again out of your gains ?I bet you will...

WHO WAS ABLE TO BUY THE DIPS?
"GS was under accumulation today, I guess somebody other than me sees the value here too."
"I, fortunately, bought WSM stock yesterday before it went up over 20.00 but I'm sure some people listened to the deliberate downgrade from GS last month and sold their WSM stock.I hope Goldman Sachs goes down and down and down and down. Goldman Sachs downgraded Williams and Sonoma and Williams Sonoma smashed crushed and destroyed earnings. Goldman Sachs is responsible for those that sold WSM and Goldman Sachs should be investigated by the federal governmentGoldman Sachs downgraded Williams and Sonoma a little over a month ago for absolutely no reason other than their own profits. Goldman Sachs was hoping to bring the stock down so they could buy in cheaper. Goldman Sachs knew that WSM was going to crush earnings, increase the dividend, and have a company buyback of billions of stocks. Williams in Sonoma crushed and smashed earnings as well as raise their dividend by 20% and is also buying back millions of dollars of stocks. Williams and Sonoma will be over 250 in less than a year. I will be posting this on every board. GS ARE LIARS AND DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE'S POCKET BUT THEIR OWN. i AM ALSO PULLING MY MONEY OUT OF GS AND DUMPING THEIR STOCK."
NASDAQ IS PARTNERING WITH GOLDMAN SACHS - HUGE RUN UPS COMINGBETWEEN GS HIGE SMASHING EARNINGS AND NASDAQ PARTNERING WITH GS WE CAN EXPECT A RUN UP TOMORROW TO $380.00-$390.00
Cramer said sales open for insiders next 3 days so not to buy! Any thoughts?
Short GS ... long aapl
Will it fly or will it drop that is the question
"DITTO ON THIS POST William is right, this was nothing more than creating a buying opportunity, there was no pandemic that caused a dip today or inflation didn't cause a dip, this was called simply, a Great Stock with Huge upside that everyone wanted to buy cheaper. Tomorrow GS will run High and the next day and the next day we have months of upside that will bring GS to $440.00-460.00"
The chart looks great.
ladder attack from H/F that want to get in cheaper or shorts either way its called smoke and mirrors. too much money being made from GS
"big fall on the way, watch and see"
"Goldman Sachs (GS) reported second-quarter earnings results on Tuesday that far exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strength in investment banking.Here were the key figures versus expectations: Adjusted earnings per share (EPS): $15.02 per share vs. $10.15 estimate"
Bad Karma is what will ultimately cause Goldman to drop to 275 over the next 30 days.

Does this stock ever go down?
"Great stock and company. Own shares. I think it's going into earnings too hot. They will blow out expectations but probably pull back, which is where I will buy more. Two quarters ago, it pulled back to 284, then over the next two months rocketed up to 393. GS and MS are the banks to own."
"Tony, can you give a reference? Can find only one insider trader ---in Q1."
I hope the weak hands didn't fold during the couple days of dip last week. Still the best stock in the DJIA.
So GS is now up 115% since the election. Investigate now. They own the FED.

"China investment's should be made with caution and, I'll explain my reasoning. China has claimed the whole China Sea making manmade island's to expand it's territory, no other country in the world ever did this !!!!! Year's ago they made Russia worry about the eastern side of their country, now look at what their doing with India and other smaller far east countries too. They want to expand everywhere in Africa and Middle East too. China is causeing many world problem's by supporting Terrorist Group's in the Mid East, Africa, and even BLM throughout the world. Their trying to create unrest in every country but then say stay out of our business, now that's a threat with the way their building up their military. They are looking for conflict with any and all in the world, they want to destroy and them dominate everybody. If this is allowed to continue, it will lead to world war where everybody will be in harm's way. They are not the country of 20-30 year's ago, and people around the world better wakeup and smell the coffee fast. Investor's and business's better understand what China is now before it's to late, they want to be the only country in the world !!!!! Enough said on this subject, don't ever say you all were not warned. Covid and other virus's are not done yet, the world's brainy idiot's will see to that. I like silver/gold but, you also need to breath, eat, and drink at least water. God Bless The USA."
I guarantee Goldman will hit 270 before the end of the year.
Buy GS to hedge tech ... it worked so well past year
People have become so conditioned to believe Goldman will keep going up since its up 185 bucks per share since Covid started but guess what it can't last. That's why they call it a market. Ill buy Goldman at 270.
"Warren, people arent selling GS, they are buying GS, the shorting today was just a reason to buy more shares. Its all part of the playbook and investors know when to hedge. I always buy lower and sell higher"

"ER tomorrow can be expected to be very strong, not surprised they announce additional share buyback as well. JMHO"
GS downgraded WSM and WSM smashed earnings. GS only cares about their own pockets. In fact watching the ig short movie right now and GS is constantly in the movie as a crooked company
$450.00 very soon. This is obvious. Next 30 days will be very important.
GS is a the crown jewel in the finical service industry. It has approved to be a winner in many finical crises. It is one of the best and safest investments for now.

"Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Crushed Earnings and profit shot higher in the second quarter, as accelerating economic growth and market gains lifted many of the Wall Street firm's business lines.Goldman reported quarterly profit of $5.49 billion, or $15.02 a share, on revenue of $15.39 billion. Both measures were up significantly from a year ago and better than the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who forecast profit of $10.25 a share.This spring's rapid U.S. economic recovery, helped by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and extensive business reopening and hiring, energized banks' deal makers. Corporate chieftains and buyout firms put hundreds of billions of dollars to work in big-ticket acquisitions. Investors gobbled up billions of dollars of stock sold by startups in marquee initial public offerings and private fundraising rounds. Goldman's investment bankers brought in $3.61 billion in fees in the second quarter, up 36% from last year's second quarter.Goldman was an adviser on many of the quarter's largest deals, including AT&T Inc.'s combination of its WarnerMedia division with Discovery Inc., Medline Industries Inc.'s sale to a group of private-equity firms and Microsoft Corp.'s $16 billion acquisition of Nuance Communications Inc.Buoyant stock markets also fueled Goldman's asset-management division, which includes funds and investments the bank manages for itself and for clients.
