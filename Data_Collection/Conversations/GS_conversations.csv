"Smart to start a position in the financials $MS $COF $JEF $GS $BK $WFC $C $BLK $BX if you haven't already. No need to take big bites... adding shares gradually over the coming year should do. Of course, pullbacks are to be exploited. gl2a."

"I just can't understand all of you investor's in China, you make no sense. China had their hand's in the middle east debacle, BLM around the world, helping Iran with terrorism around the world, etc.. I think that all of those smaller countries in the far east should join together to resist China's interference in their countries. In other word's an alliance business wise and protection. I am really close to stop buying anything to do with China, it's getting dangerous by them threatening everybody. And if the world want's to go Green Energy, you need to use ALOT of SILVER TO BUILD THAT TECHNOLOGY !!!!! God Bless The USA."

GS told everyone to buy ZM before earnings? They shorted ZM and millions of people lost money today. GS is being shorted by thousands of people tomorrow

"There is no more stimulus heading our way anymore. Just pull up the max chart on GS and you'll see that's its gone straight up for the last several months. Goldman isn't a great company anymore, they have lost hundreds of good people because they expect you to put the company ahead of your wife and kids. I refuse to support these types of businesses."
