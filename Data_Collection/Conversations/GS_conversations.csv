GS has a P/E of 7.45 if given a reason multiple of 15 this is an $850 per share company. Best in class
US stock market is a scam .... reform is needed!!5
Looks like another pump and dump today..Are you learning anything ?Do you not see buying the dip is no longer working ?
I said GS would hit $400 by Friday. I was off by one trading day.
Earning expected to be real good
Millions of Americans can't get their refunds from the IRS. This is going to get interesting................
"With the eviction moratorium expiring, more and more people will be going back to work, so the jobs report this Friday can be expected to be pretty strong, IMHO"

"GS will go up to a new high soon. It proves the capability of making big money in any environments evidenced by the 3nd Q earning report.

NO PUMPING TODAY ...WHY
"Apparently for some of you, buying a 7 multiple stock with a 2% yield, a 1 book value ratio and a 20% annual earnings growth rate isn't good enough for you, so maybe you should toddle over to Robinhood and buy yourself some of the dinosaur GME at $200. "

"Peter from Game of Trades on YouTube says, after this correction, there will be one more new all time high blowoff top. Then we head into the dark night of a secular bear market."
Fascinating how yahoo has updated most if not all financial banks with the latest reported eps. In the summary for GS the EPS still showing 54.46 when TTM EPS should be 60.63. Making the PE. A ridiculous 6.79.MS JPM up today. MS at 13 PE while JPM at 10.66.
Congratulations to you guys

"If you've enjoyed GS's 48% price appreciation so far this year, you are really going to enjoy the next 75%. Earnings reporting coming right up and they will be stellar. Where else are you going to find a solid 7 P/E company yielding 2%. :-)"
"Fraud, theft and gambling company issues another big stealings report. The gallows patiently awaits."
"You would think that after GS has risen from $135 to over $400 since last year it would be time to take some profits, but GS still has another 70% more to go. Right now they pay about a 2% dividend to boot, with an increase coming. Great stock."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Banks earnings will be great!!!!
405puts worthless today
Best in class stock. If you don’t own Goldman what do you own?
"Ahead of Whistleblower testimony tomorrow...Facebook shut down their servers, LOL"
TOLD YOU SELL IT BEFORE GOES RED....AND NOW IS RED
Remarkable
Bounced !!!
is gs involved with evergrande? probably
buy FAS to get back your loss here much faster - IMO
"Wow, another great opportunity to sell Goldman today before the stocks crash."
"Why are credit card / financials like VISA, Square, Paypal etc tanking today ?"
Dimon says ‘bitcoin is worthless’ amid crypto bull run
GS gonna go up but i wonder if last year's trend will repeat this year. the stock didnt start going up till the beginning of november last year
402.5 put is also good ...free money
"When the US stock market was suffering from COVID, all these hedge funds would even hesitate to start heavily shorting US stocks, why wouldn't they do the same to all those Chinese stocks?The CCP had made it clear with Global News, they're not gonna bail Evergrand out.Just stop pumping money into it, and do what you do best, short them to bankruptcy."
Thievery
They will beat earnings out of the water again.
