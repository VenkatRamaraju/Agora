"share price crashed $3, The book crashed $1.60, the earnings report was a huge crash, and the hopium spread here should scare off anyone. Look to the financials at edgar=SEC for proof of what I post. SHORT HAS WON!"
"Wow… up $1500 on SP Big divy coming in a few days, think I’ll take my Benz downtown and grab some ribeyes for dinner, glad I found this stock, buy hold, prosper, shorts get dollar menu, ha ha ha"
last 20 min. 3.7 mil. run volume. agnc bought tens of millions of shares pumping up to $19. So lots of paint at the agnc used shares dealership. they own. lol talk about conflict of interest. lol
"EVERGRANDE AND FANTASIA both RE investment co.'s who have hundreds of billions in debt, held by Blackrock and many agnc holders so, we will see shares liquidated by China. agnc goes much much lower on no reits earnings $400 million write down due to mortgage LOSSES !"
"As for financials, my Wells Fargo is up 59%. My BAC up huge too. How'z agnus the old dog stock. well 1/2 of the S&P performance."
Shorting this week netted 3 months worth of dividends. bagholders wait 90 days for what I made in 4 days.
Never understand companies like this. 54 employees the CEO makes 8 million a year and the other high-level executives make over 2 million. Companies like this seem like they skim a lot of money from something and actually produce nothing. What does this company do that actually adds value.
market is all green. agnc is red. as usual short to win. ssdd.
"Not sure why there are so many bashers here except I suspect they are in sweat mode (or only a couple who just keep posting dozens of negative tropes over and over). We should however consider the validity of the bashers (shorts?) arguments. First we must consider the steepening yield curve. A business like AGNC will surely expand their margins in this present yield curve scenario. What AGNC did 10 years ago is irrelevant unless it pressures the business today.Meanwhile, AGNC is the veritable definition of a value stock, which like many others will benefit from the (likely) continuing shift from growth to value, IMO.Secondly, AGNC is trading at almost 8.5% below present book value of $17.49. Info regarding book value is readily available. So just a matter of simply doing the math to arrive at the stock discount as compared to the book value. Saying anything otherwise is just plain false, unless the bashers have an update to the present book value info easily available at various financial websites like Yahoo Finance.Thirdly, the present 1 year return is over 14%, not counting dividends of another 9%+ if monthly compounding in a drip account. So a hefty one year return, very positive.These are facts, not misrepresentations or hyperbole. It is true that I cannot say what will happen going forward. But it is also true that there are tail winds brewing for this company and I like the risk/reward proposition going forward.I bought in last week at 15.89$/share and because of those likely tail winds for this company I will accumulate a bigger position going forward. Meanwhile, another observation is that my experience has been when you look at chats or discussion boards and the shorts are trying to drown out real discussions regarding the merits of a position, and when they are fear mongering with half truths and downright lies this typically indicates they are in panic mode and making panic arguments and maybe eventually panic decisions, ie this is often a great indicator of the particular security, like agnc, being a likely buy. It’s good to see that recently the short position in agnc expanded. It means when shorts throw in the towel, if they should give up on their short position, they will have to buy back the stock.As I said above, tail winds. The market is made up of short and long positions and that certainly makes a market, but when a companies prospects are in progress of turning positive and the easy money short position starts not being so easy and hemorrhaging $, as the stock is moving up this bodes well for the longs. Couple this with the shorts having to pay the (relentless monthly) dividend on their borrowed shares that they are shorting, well prognosis is very good for an upward move let alone the stability of the continuing dividend. I appreciate when a short borrows my shares and thus assumes responsibility for paying me my dividends. Bill, thank you for pointing me to this opportunity. Time will tell if the rest of the market discovers these opportunities, like I recently have?Wishing good luck to all!"
this biden market is just too strong. too bad agnc isn't. weak hand for sure.
"In addition, Inst. ownership has fallen 18% recently, book values crashes twice recently, the records show a huge decline in revenues and a minus -$400 MILLION on their own equity, no net earnings on fed mreits for years. agnc is NOT GUARANTEED or backed by govt.ONLY THE MORTGAGE PAPER IS BACKED!!!! not agnc or it's stock.with a true net from div's after costs at 2.4% in a record stock market this went down hard ! Reits do better in hard times when the market is crashing not rising! facts not opinions or name calling."
SEC. FIN. FIL. SHOWS MINUS -$400 MILLION NET CONTINUING OPERATIONS= MBS SECURITIES ! GO SEE MINUS- $0.83 ON GOVT. PAPER !THIS IS JUST GAMBLING. HEDGING= DOLLAR ROLL TRADE= the only source of income for this reit for years now. see the truth at edgar.
"I own AGNC at an average price of $17.41 and like the dividends but... A common thought of stock buyers... ""I just hope it gets back up to what I paid for it"""

"This is what the biggest experts on risk assets like agnc has to say for Mon.SEANA SMITH: As we see risky assets continuing to tumble today, worry about the spillover from China's Evergrande debt crisis, it's also hitting crypto markets. Bitcoin off nearly 10% right now, Ether off just around 11%. So we're certainly seeing some of that concern spillover to the crypto markets. And high risk assets like mreits.We want to talk a little bit more about this with Noelle Acheson, Head of Market Insights at Genesis Trading. And, Noelle, we're looking at some collateral damage, it looks like, when it comes to crypto. From your perspective, I guess, how big of a concern should this or is this for crypto investors? "" The fallout will soon hit all high risk paper assets.""NOELLE ACHESON: Hi, Seana. Great to be with you. Yeah, just kind of brutal up there today, isn't it? The crypto sell-off has two components, basically, that I'm seeing. And they are, both of them, related to the Evergrande concerns. And Fantasia. Blackrock and many Hedge Funds find themselves buried in too much paper risk. Like AGNC.I should say, I do have to point out nothing I say is investment advice, and these are my opinions not those of my employers. But broadly, Bitcoin does tend to avoid-- and other crypto assets-- it does tend to move in line with sentiment. And what we are seeing is a shift to risk-off sentiment. It started in the Asian markets overnight and just trickled through to the European and the US opens.This is showing that Bitcoin is not the safe haven some people claim it is in the short-term-- longer term, that's a totally different story. But when investors need to sell liquid assets to raise cash when the sentiment turns, Bitcoin destiny is a liquid asset and so it falls into that bucket. The second component is much more crypto-specific. And this is related to the concerns around Tether-- stablecoin Tether-- which accounts for about half of the market capitalization of stablecoins and is a significant component of crypto market liquidity. And now poor earnings and no dividend raise, leaves investors weary of the game of take-away played by mgmnt. against the commons here. ie The 41.5% payout, the 2 book declines last month."
Book value here WAS $31.64. Now it's $16.39. Dividend was $6. Now $1.44.Cap was 13 Billion now it's 8. Annualized return 2010=30.6% 2011=22.9%. declining asset!!!
"For years agnc has relied on hedging, dollar roll trade, shorting agnc has paid the bills. Agnc borrows the money to pay dividends, due to $0.83 loss on their holdings. ie MBS folio. How'd they do on those? Hey longs explain THE $400 MILLION WRITE DOWN ON ALL IT'S EQUITY FOR ONLY 90 DAYS !!Will that be the same in a few weeks when they lower the book and announce another stock offering. The insiders are currently presenting. ie Barclay's. And still stagnate volume. Very little upside risk. Dividend will hold til the years end a couple months max.Unless the past 9 years trajectory is a fluke? I think not."
"with only 3.6 mil. sh. all day. I expect ""paint the tape"" again ssdd. but....lots of sellers so maybe free fall. ha ha ha doubt it. this is a day short mostly very manipulated. agnc owns their own brokerage and dealers. so easy"
For those interested in facts and not Flaming diatribes just go to;Yahoo Finance>AGNC>Link titled ‘Show All Key Statistics’>Scroll Down to ‘Balance Sheet’There in black and white Book Value = $17.49
"Never seen a stock chat like this thread before. Wow, you people need a new hobby."
"agnc is only 14yrs old, and has crashed the dividend 11 times! FACT!"
Price to book value 91%. Dividend payout 42%. Yield 9%. This thing is dirt cheap! No downside risk. Even if it continues to go sideways we collect 9%.
"PRETTY MUCH THE SAME B/V AS LAST MONTH...ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS FOR THE 30 YEAR TREASURY TO START INCREASING INTEREST RATES WHILE THE FED.

Declares Monthly Common Stock Dividend of $0.12 per Common Share for September 2021 and Announces Estimated Tangible Net Book Value of $16.25 per Common Share as of August 31, 2021"
"I've commented at length about trade imbalances. And why I don't take Friday's too seriously on heavily manipulated shares. It's very easy to hold up prices on no volume. As soon as the funds sell into this for liquidity, or it's lack of stable earnings, or just a shake out, this will go to 70-80% of book. Which is dropping. Unless things change over night? Which doesn't happen here. Steady decline 9 years running is not an opinion. It's a chart. GLTA"
"shrinkage, dilution, book de-valuing, share price collapse, dividend declines for 9 years straight !! who would risk money here? short"
"June 7, 2021 agnc sold for $18.84. use to sell at $36.00. Dividend has only been raised 3 times in HISTORY! SHORTS HAVE WON. PERIOD. DAY SHORT EVEN BETTER!"

"Agnc drops less than 1/2 percent while markets crash, safe solid company, trades in a narrow range and pays 9% divy monthly. Buy and hold, prosper, watch shorts panic. Lmao"
Ever wonder why a bunch of losers keep posting 25 to 40 posts a day to try and sacra people away from a stock. I dont even see this s-----tt on memes. I can only wonder how scowled and disgruntled these sorry excuses for resembling human beings are. I can say I never pumped a stock including this. I have my convictions and as you have seen so are others who more recently bought into AGNC. Since I am up over 1200 in value and have collected months of dividends. More than likely more than one of the now 7 headed serpent is the same. Do your DD. If you like it try it. If it doesnt work sell it. Cant lose much at these levels or you can join me in gaining month by month. What a sorry bunch of low lifes sitting on a dividend board wailing to no end like cry babies. Get a life.

Only USA paper. Many reits have collapsed under debt. agnc almost $50 Billion, saute in some vaseline cuz agnc dollar roll trade is their only source of paying anything. Heavy preffie debt too. Now put that hot mess into the broiler at 600 that is the market conditions, now glaze over with the blow torch that is kain diluting the company on drip as the shares increase insiders reap rewards.

The 12 cents will be the minimum next book reduction. was $32.00 when agnc was growing not shrinking like it is. MINUS $400 MILLION REAL DOLLARS!see filing 10Q.
"#3 PUMPERS FAVORITE LIE."" CASH ON HAND OR PER SHARE is good. NO!How can it be bad? IT'S ALL BORROWED CASH. see $50 billion DEBT as in 7 times leverage. Meaning each share owes that cash or their debt is 7 times their REAL TANGIBLE VALUE OF ASSETS! Agnc lost $400 BILLION in equity just last quarter. The dividend has dropped 12 times. 9 years straight. only 3 increases in 14 year history. so not sound or safe or 9% or 95% payout all just bait and switch accounting. NON-GAAP."

"IN 2012 AGNC INVESTORS ATE 6 SPO'S, AND A CRASH IN BOOK. 2 BOOK CRASHES IN 90 DAYS. ADD THE HUGE SPO $1.25 BILLION. DECLINING SINCE 2012! THAT'S HUGE DEPRECIATION. CELEBRATE LONGS ONLY 2 DIV. CRASHES SO FAR THIS YEAR !"
"UNDERSTANDING MORTGAGE REITS AND AGNC >>>A mortgage REIT seeks to borrow capital at low short-term lending rates, which can then be used to acquire higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). What AGNC and its mortgage REIT peers are aiming to do is maximize their net interest margin -- i.e., the difference between the average yield on long-term assets and the average borrowing rate.What's particularly noteworthy about the mortgage REIT industry is that it looks to be in the sweet spot of its growth cycle. When the yield curve is flattening (i.e., when the gap in yield between short-term and long-term Treasury yields is shrinking) and/or the Federal Reserve is making rapid changes to its monetary policy, companies like AGNC often see their net interest margin shrink. Conversely, when the yield curve is steepening and the nation's central bank is transparently telegraphing its monetary policy moves, it's normal for mortgage REITs to expand their book value and generate higher income. Looking back decades, it's extremely common for the latter scenario to take place during the early years of an economic recovery.Also working in AGNC Investments' favor is its focus on agency securities.

AGNC has lowered the dividend for 9 years straight! Not 1 increase for longs. But ceo gets a lot of bonuses. AGNC has LOST money on mreits for YEARS NOW! NO earnings except shorting AGNC stock through dollar roll trade. Look it up. Longs are just bagholders for agnc.
"I posted my economic view and it was removed=LOL in short mreits do well after the crashes. see 2000, and 2008. Here is evidence in a solid comp art.The market for some of the junkiest junk debt has never been better, as plentiful sources of funding keep companies on the brink alive.According to BofA Global Research, there was not a single default for a CCC-rated issuer in the last three month. The last time a default happened: the March to May period of 2007. see the correlation? no. not surprised."

"REIT) AGNC Investment (NASDAQ:AGNC) is the stock you'll want to know.A mortgage REIT seeks to borrow capital at low short-term lending rates, which can then be used to acquire higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). What AGNC and its mortgage REIT peers are aiming to do is maximize their net interest margin -- i.e., the difference between the average yield on long-term assets and the average borrowing rate.What's particularly noteworthy about the mortgage REIT industry is that it looks to be in the sweet spot of its growth cycle. When the yield curve is flattening (i.e., when the gap in yield between short-term and long-term Treasury yields is shrinking) and/or the Federal Reserve is making rapid changes to its monetary policy, companies like AGNC often see their net interest margin shrink. Conversely, when the yield curve is steepening and the nation's central bank is transparently telegraphing its monetary policy moves, it's normal for mortgage REITs to expand their book value and generate higher income. Looking back decades, it's extremely common for the latter scenario to take place during the early years of an economic recovery.Also working in AGNC Investment's favor is its focus on agency securities. Agency assets are backed by the federal government in the event of a default. Through the midpoint of 2021, $85.5 billion of AGNC's $87.5 billion in securities were agency assets. Though this added protection does lower the yield the company receives on its assets, it also allows the company to utilize leverage to pump up its profits.NOTE THE PART THAT SPEAKS ABOUT MORTGAGE REITS COMING INTO THEIR SWEET SPOT, TOTALLY AGREE"

In 2021, at a shareholder meeting, Buffett declared that “I do not think the average person can pick stocks,” and noted that he recommends the S&P 500 index fund to “have for a long, long time to people.”"

"Feds come out today and squash any hopium induced nonsense about rates increasing soon. Or enough to make mreits at agnc profitable. Too many pumpers here claiming rates are rising when in fact the opposite is true. So read this, then short this pig. But don't take my angle. Do some DD.The Fed has promised to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate at the current near-zero level until the economy reaches full employment, and inflation has not only reached its 2% goal but is on track to stay modestly above that level for some time.The central bank set those parameters when inflation had been running below 2% for years, and the big challenge was seen as lifting it up rather than tamping it down.But now, the opposite problem may be emerging, as pent-up consumer demand fuels spending in a reopening economy and businesses, hobbled by supply bottlenecks, struggle to keep up.In forecasts released alongside last month's policy statement, half of Fed policymakers thought a rate hike would be needed before the end of next year, with all but one forecasting a first increase in borrowing costs before the end of 2023.Key for investors - and the millions of Americans who still can't find jobs - is the question of whether policymakers will need to begin raising rates earlier to stop inflation from spiraling upward, potentially sacrificing labor market gains in the process.Powell has played down the possibility of being forced into that uncomfortable position.But the data may be trending against him. U.S. consumer prices rose 5.4% in the 12 months through September https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-solidly-september-2021-10-13, the U.S. government reported on Wednesday, and traders of interest rate futures boosted their bets that the Fed would have to start lifting rates by next September.In the minutes, ""various"" policymakers thought that economic conditions would likely justify keeping rates near their current level for ""the next couple of years."" A ""number,"" however, felt rates would need to rise by the end of next year because they felt it would have reached full employment; ""some"" also thought inflation would remain elevated with risks to the upside, the minutes showed. see so, low interest environment has been agnc's admitted downfall and it will continue a long time. agnc is buried in debt. No huge increase in rates to save them...? SPO's and reverse splits only 2 ways to deal with costs of preffies and div. here. $50 billion in debt. minus $400 million last 10Q, mreits collapsed."

interest rates moving up. Highest since March 2020. You can blather all you want but that is really all that matters. As long as the REIT is positioned well for rising rates and not in need of dilutive capital then your holding will do well.

"Rates flattening the curve again. And 30yr. and 15yr., and even 5yr. ALL LOWER RATES THAN A YEAR AGO. Homeowners who were waiting to refinance until mortgage rates became a little more favorable just got their wish.Rates on some of America’s most popular types of home loans have fallen once again, and rates on 30-year mortgages are back beneath a major threshold, according to new data from a long-running survey.Mortgage rates had spiked at the end of September, so the new declines are something of a surprise — and a pleasant one for homeowners, because rates at their current levels have reopened the door to significant refinance savings.But if the factors behind the drop in rates are temporary, as many expect, the cost of a refi crash again due to inflation."

To all the Pollyannas…think of me as Cassandra. A simple search of AGNC’s dividend history will show you the frequency of div cuts. Every 1 to 2 years AGNC cuts the dividend. It right there in black and white. Do a search.

THE NET YIELD IS 2% any costs to that 8%div. like SHARE PRICE HAS DECLINED FASTER THAN DIVIDEND BUILDS CAPITAL. and yet YOU still owe taxes for div. you didn't deduct. Further the ROC has been leading the div. as in faster than 12 cents. So you are FOS! let's add to your costs HOW MUCH DID THE BOOK VALUE OF TANGIBLE ASSETS DECLINE? hint....more than dividend accumulates. Last the $400 million loss last quarter...add dilution of 50 million shares. You lost money but hold anyway right?
"UNDERSTANDING MORTGAGE REITS AND AGNC >>>A mortgage REIT seeks to borrow capital at low short-term lending rates, which can then be used to acquire higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). What AGNC and its mortgage REIT peers are aiming to do is maximize their net interest margin -- i.e., the difference between the average yield on long-term assets and the average borrowing rate.What's particularly noteworthy about the mortgage REIT industry is that it looks to be in the sweet spot of its growth cycle. When the yield curve is flattening (i.e., when the gap in yield between short-term and long-term Treasury yields is shrinking) and/or the Federal Reserve is making rapid changes to its monetary policy, companies like AGNC often see their net interest margin shrink. Conversely, when the yield curve is steepening and the nation's central bank is transparently telegraphing its monetary policy moves, it's normal for mortgage REITs to expand their book value and generate higher income. Looking back decades, it's extremely common for the latter scenario to take place during the early years of an economic recovery.Also working in AGNC Investments' favor is its focus on agency securities. Agency assets are backed by the federal government in the event of a default. Through the midpoint of 2021, $85.5 billion of AGNC's $87.5 billion in securities were agency assets. Though this added protection does lower the yield the company receives on its assets, it also allows the company to utilize leverage to pump up its profits.NOTE THE PART THAT SPEAKS ABOUT MORTGAGE REITS COMING INTO THEIR SWEET SPOT, TOTALLY AGREEIN 2009 THRU 2011 AFTER THE REALESTATE DEBACLE THAT TOOK THE MARKET DOWN AGNC GENERATED A DIVIDEND OF $1.40 A 1/4ER OR $5.60 A YEAR ALONG WITH THE SHARE PRICE RISING TO $35.00 WHILE THE GENERAL MARKET WAS IN DISARRAY...THAT WAS WHAT A SWEET SPOT LOOKS LIKE...I AM A BUYER UNDER $17.50,,,I CAN'T GUARANTEE IT BUT I COULD BE SPOT ON...WHAT'S IS EXCELLENT IS AGNC PAYS .12 CENTS A SHARE DIVIDEND EACH MONTH...AGNC MAKES OVER$5 MILLION EVERY DAY INCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS...AGNC IS NOT OVERVALUED LIKE 90% OF ALL OTHER SPECULATION STOCKS...use it or lose it.."

"AGNC LOST $27M. ON MORTGAGES. FUTURE RATES FALL SO WILL AGNC!Mortgage rates declined this week, marking their fourth consecutive week below 3% and further evidence of the strength in the economy’s recovery from the pandemic recession.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average for the benchmark 30-year home-loan rate eased to 2.94% from 2.96% last week. At this time last year, the long-term rate was 3.28%.The rate for a 15-year loan, popular among those seeking to refinance, slipped to 2.26% from 2.30% last week.Experts are expecting mortgage rates to increase modestly in the short term, while remaining at low levels in light of the Federal Reserve’s goal of keeping its key interest rate near zero until the economy recovers from the pandemic.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently made clear that the central bank isn’t even close to starting a pullback in its ultra-low interest rate policies. This despite the economy’s rapid strengthening, inflation showing signs of picking up and the country making progress toward defeating the viral pandemic.The acceleration in prices, which has been building for months, has unsettled financial markets and raised concerns that it could weaken the economic recovery. The government reported this week that a worrisome bout of inflation struck in April, with consumer prices for goods and services surging 0.8% — the largest monthly jump in more than a decade — and the year-over-year increase reaching its fastest rate since 2008.The report from the Labor Department showed sharply higher prices for everything from food and clothes to housing. A 10% surge in the prices of used cars and trucks, a record jump, accounted for roughly one-third of last month’s overall increases.The latest bright news came in a government report Thursday that the number of Americans seeking unemployment aid fell last week to 473,000, a new pandemic low and the latest evidence that fewer employers are cutting jobs as consumers ramp up spending and more businesses reopen. The decline — the fourth in the past five weeks — coincides with a raft of states led by Republican governors who have blamed expanded jobless benefits for a slowdown in hiring and are acting to cut off the additional aid."
