"Much of the income is from is ""dollar roll income"" from mortgage backed securities. To quote Investopedia, this is essentially a short. May effect the book value? Anyway, enjoy it while it lasts. I have 2000 shares."
This Is going to go back over 16.40 next week book value is 16.5 . This is a great entry point below 16 in my opinion. Buying
"agnc lost $3 in share price this past year. PERIOD! And yet I see year after year and the div. declines. Leverage declined, as did institutional ownership %. Revenues declined. Quarterly growth declined. The insiders playing the market with dividends and sitting on debt. And the insiders salt the payroll using yep...dividends through insider trading using the MM. ain't it great? for them"
"AGNC PAYS $1.08 DIV. 3 Q'S. iT'S LOST $1.31 ON BOOK SO NET GAIN TO COMMONS MINUS -$0.23CENTS . LOL YEAR AIN'T OVER...HA HA SELLING SHARES CEO, AGNC, DOLLAR ROLL, AND ME. SHORT !"
Who is the big buy here? Someone just bought 7 million share in 1 hr. 20 min. wow. Somebody knows something.
Did you know agnc started in 2008 with a book value of $17.45 yeah higher than now. shrinkage and a declining asset here. by design.
I listened to the conference call and wanted to share this comment that was mentioned with the real long term shareholders here :The current book value has risen by a little more than .5 % this month.This would put the actual book value around $16.50Certainly not the doom and gloom that has been repeatedly posted again and again.
AGNC INCREASE IN CASH POSITION FROM $4.5 BILLION TO $5.2 BILLION...

"These declines in book value per share also caused dividend cuts. AGNC Investment cut its dividend by 48%, while Annaly cut its dividend by a third. MFA Financial was able to maintain its dividend; however, its March dividend increase was quickly reversed."
"AGNC is buying 1 billion $$ of its own shares through to Dec 31, 2022 . Now thatâ€™s a clear sign for me this is a great entry point . I am bullish"
"MANAGEMENT REMARKS""We are very pleased with AGNC's third quarter financial results, which benefited from relatively stable market conditions during the quarter,"" said Peter Federico, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our very attractive 9% dividend yield, coupled with a modest increase in tangible net book value in the third quarter, drove our strong economic return of 2.3%."
Chart on right margin move it to quarterly and enjoy 4th Q 2020 and 1stQ 2021 far exceeded Q2 and Q3 so declining trend. period.

"FOR years agnc has relied on hedging, dollar roll trade, shorting agnc has paid the bills. Agnc borrows the money to pay dividends, due to $0.83 loss on their holdings. ie MBS folio. How'd they do on those? Hey longs explain THE $400 MILLION WRITE DOWN ON ALL IT'S EQUITY FOR ONLY 90 DAYS !!Will that be the same in a few weeks when they lower the book and announce another stock offering. The insiders are currently presenting. ie Barclay's. And still stagnate volume. Very little upside risk. Dividend will hold til the years end a couple months max.Unless the past 9 years trajectory is a fluke? I think not."
