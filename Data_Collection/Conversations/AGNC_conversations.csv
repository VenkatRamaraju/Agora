Question: Does short have to cover the dividend as well?
Looks like the Motley bunch must have unloaded their stake in AGNC last week and now their badmouthing it in today's spew.
"Sept 13, 2021AGNC Investment Corp. Declares Monthly Common Stock Dividend of $0.12 per Common Share for September 2021 and Announces Estimated Tangible Net Book Value of $16.56 per Common Share as of August 31, 2021"
"Lmao sorry I have to say something before the acid clowns show back up. Man this stock is killing me. Im up almost 4 grand, I am collecting a nice dividend. Back in the short camp they made a few sheckles so they could get another week at the Motel 6. Micki Ds meal deal must be getting old after a few months. Enjoying the fruits of smart investing."
With all the new shares 1.25 Billion well agnc will have to cut the dividend soon. As they have for 9 years straight. So dividend is not safe at all.
"Declining asset. As has been explained here many times. I warned on earnings, on the SPO, on the dividend declines, on the lack of earnings from reits. In addition I have called my trades in advance, not like every long here=after the fact bragging cannot compare with a real trader who has skin in the game and decades exp. So, glta. goes lower"
"Still no dividend increase, book value drops yet again."
"I’ve owned Agnc for about a year, I’m at 12,000 shares now and fond of the $1440 I get each month. My average cost is just under 16$ share so I’m slightly green on cost. I’m in for the long haul so if the share price crashes I’ll just add more. Great long term play I think. There’s risk in anything but I’m puzzled by the hateful attacks I read on this forum. If you think agnc is such a poor company don’t buy it, if I wanna play the short game there’s way better then this. Call me the happy “ bag holder” lol"
"I have 3 quarters of good payouts. Never misses my account. neither does the complete horse manure that comes from the 4 clowns. I know your disgruntled past investor and if thats the case be a man and state it. You cant be here shorting for pennies, then again you could be. A penny made is a penny earned. Good luck with that theory. I make millions of pennies weekly. If they put half their collective efforts into true investing maybe they could claim a victory."
NICE DROP BAGHOLDERS !
Another win day for shorts. see any daily chart. The crashes far exceed the div. SSDD
"Well Terence was correct, and what a joke he couldnt provide the facts. The officer Christopher who held nearly 500.00 shares sold a measly 45k. Big friggin deal. Heck most companies officers sell nearly all there shares in a lot of companies. Heres the link that braino couldnt provide. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/agnc/insider-activity"
"Interesting quote from the CC""15-year MBS outperformed 30s and given this relative performance we reduced our 15-year holdings by a little over $6.5 billion. Some of these sales were replaced with production coupon 30-year MBS.So they sell the overperformers and buy underperformers - Like a guy at the roulette table - Red hit 5 times in a row, so I'll bet black because it's dueWhadda way to run a business."
"IT'S TO BAD THEIR ARE SO MANY GREEN PEA INVESTORS IN AGNC THAT ARE HITTING THE SELL BUTTON BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE...I WILL USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADD SHARES ON THE CHEAP...SO YOU SELLERS DON'T LIKE THE .76 EARNINGS OR THE $4.7 BILLION CASH POSITION, HUM...O, AND YOU DON'T THINK INTEREST RATES WILL EVER GO UP, HUM, AND YOU THINK THAT INFLATION IS JUST TEMPORARY, HUM... IMO THIS TIME PERIOD WILL GO DOWN AS THE LAST BEST BUYING OPPORTUNITY...I WILL GET BACK TO YOU IN 6 MONTHS AND WE WILL SEE...BUY HOLD COLLECT REPEAT OVER AND OVER..."
"In case you thought the earnings news was good?? Here's the horse's words:Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Higher coupon Agency MBS, the strongest performers in the first quarter, were the weakest performers in the second quarter as the decline in prepayment speeds that many had anticipated from higher mortgage rates did not materialize. Lower coupon generic Agency MBS also modestly underperformed hedges due primarily to evolving expectations about the timing of the Federal Reserve's eventual tapering of its Agency MBS purchases. As a result of these factors, AGNC's economic return in the second quarter was negative 5.5%."
"Wow nice day Friday, best of all the 4 stooges have gotten a haircut. Pity the small investor that actually falls for their Arsno of full on manure. These farm hands shovel it everyday. Enjoy the aroma boys."
"So just for some perspective in all of 2019 they made +688,000 and 2020 they lost ...-266,0000. In one quarter they lost more almost three times what they lost last year and more than they made the year before covid...that is really staggering...."
Down 15 in the AH mkt. Tomorrow will stink for longs. -8.5% in a week. Then the dividend decline and this will be $14.
Just got my stimulus check today. Thank you Gov. Newsom.
"THE 10 YEAR TREASURY IS UP 6% TODAY AND GUESS WHAT, AGNC IS ALSO UP...period..."

"Can someone present me with a compelling argument as to why Gary Kain has not been terminated despite a decade of extreme underperformance, book value destruction, share price destruction, and dividend slashings?"
LOL the 4 stooges continue their begrudging deployment of rubbish. They consist of disgruntled investors who could not manage their affairs and now want to tell us how to handle ours. Kind of sound like this present governing body does it not. FYI we can be accountable for our own gains and loses. If you spent as much time managing your affairs you might actually succeed.
"Unfortunately this message board has really gone down hill. But for what it’s worth. Tangible net book value as of June 30,2021 is $16.39. That’s excludes $526 million or $1.00 per share of goodwill. The environment hasn’t been easy with interest rates moving as quickly as they do."
"Dividend will be slashed due to preffie div. costs and $1.25 BILLION in new shares in the market, all while mgmnt is caught on the wrong side and crushed last q, all while the market is ANTI_HIGH RISK. is agnc still considered an investment, when the co. gambles with shares, while losing money at it's core business?

Hgnc HISTORICALLY TRADES AT 80% OF BOOK VALUE. WHICH IS NOT A VERIFIED VALUE. SO AGNC BOOK OF $16.25 MAKES AGNC MARKET VALUE IN $14'S. PAYOUT IS ONLY 41.5% DUE TO SHRINKAGE. MORE LOSSES ON REITS $400 MILLION LOST JUST LAST QUARTER ON MREITS.!!!!!!!!!!

IS AGNC safe to hold in an IRA? Is it subject to penalties like a Master Limited Partnership?It's dividend seems strong. Anyone know?
"This seems like a good investment. I flipping love dividend stocks. This or psec, which is better? Smart responses only."
ENDING RED. NUFF SAID !

"repost from my ORC post, which most certainly applies to AGNCHedges are should be set up to protect gains or minimize investment losses, an insurance policy, but ORC creates these insurance policies that have premiums that are consistently higher than profits – Why this is the case is open to debate, and most of answers reflect poorly on management.Stock re-purchases can be initiated because the stock is such a good value, but most often it’s because management doesn’t know what else to do with the $$ (investors lose out) or to keep the stock price up so that management individuals, especially those soon to be retiring, can make money when they exercise their options.So, pay me my dividend and I hope I’ll know when to bail."
OPENS RED FOR THE SHORTS. SSDD
How is agnc taxedI appreciate any help
Bought the dip….again.
2 giant div. sized crashes just today!
GREAT MORNING SHORT.

Bought 5k in May. Taking the dividend and letting it ride.
"STAY ALERT,,,YOU HAVE A FEW MONTHS TO BUY CHEAP SHARES BEFORE AGNC HEADS THRU $20.00 _THIS IS WHAT AGNC CEO PETER FEDERICO SAID YESTERDAY ON THE EARNINGS CALL ABOUT AGNC FUTURE...IMO HE IS SPOT ON...IMO IN 12 MONTHS AGNC WILL BE DOING $1.00 A 1/4ER EARNINGS...BUY HOLD COLLECT AND REPEAT OVER AND OVER WHILE AGNC IS BELOW $17.50...If you look forward 12 months from now, likely rates are higher. At some point, the curve is steeper. That's going to be a really good environment for Agency. Likely, we're not going to have to be competing with the Fed for assets.That's another good benefit for the Agency MBS market. So we're going to continue to approach it from that longer-term perspective. We'll have to endure the volatility. You're going to have to be active in rebalancing both your asset and hedge side of the portfolio.In this environment, you'll see us continue to do that. But over the long run, I think we have the right position on. You just going to have to be willing to wait it out and ultimately, I think it's going to lead to a very strong environment for Agency MBS.CEO PETER FEDERICO RECEIVES $80,000 A MONTH IN AGNC DIVS. ON HIS SHARES...HOW MUCH DOES THE PRINCESS FOOL RECEIVE ? Duuuuuuuuuu..."
Were Hedge Funds Right About Dumping AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC)?read the article ! inst. ownership crumbles !!
"THIS IS WHAT THE INSIDERS AND CEO ACTUALLY SAID DURING REPORT!Proof of the LOSSES and very POOR performance. Don't buy the non-gaap!Thanks, Katie, and thank you to everyone on the call today. The positive trends that drove the strong performance of Agency MBS in the first quarter, largely reversed in the second quarter. MBS spreads to swap and treasury hedges, particularly longer-term hedges, widened meaningfully in May and June as interest rates rallied and the yield curve flattened. The spread widening coincided with the shift in investor sentiment following strong economic data, which, in turn, pushed the Fed to begin asset tapering discussions.The market now expects the Fed to communicate its plan for asset tapering sometime later this year. In addition, despite the first quarter increase in mortgage rates, prepayment speeds in the second quarter slowed by less than expected. These faster prepayment speeds pressured higher coupon MBS valuations and reversed the significant outperformance that these coupons experienced in the first quarter. Given the shift in sentiment regarding asset tapering and faster-than-expected prepayment speeds, spreads across the coupon stack widened with lower coupon spreads widening five to 10 basis points and higher coupon spreads widening 15 to 20 basis points.As a result, our economic return for the quarter was negative 5.5%. While this result is disappointing, it is also easier to understand when viewed in the context of the first two quarters together. To recap, in the first quarter, 10-year treasury rates increased by more than 80 basis points. The yield curve three years to 10 years steepened by more than 60 basis points and swap spreads widened.Against this backdrop, Agency MBS performed very well. Moreover, higher coupon MBS meaningfully outperformed as investors priced in more benign prepayment expectations given the recent increase in mortgage rates. With our portfolio being well balanced between lower coupon TBAs and higher coupon specified pools, our economic return in the first quarter was positive 8.2%. In the second quarter, however, we experienced a reversal of these conditions.Specifically, 10-year treasury rates rallied close to 30 basis points, the yield curve flattened by almost 40 basis points and longer-term swap spreads tightened. Against this backdrop and given the shift in Fed sentiment following stronger economic data, MBS spreads widened meaningfully. And in contrast to the first quarter, the underperformance was most pronounced in higher coupon MBS. The key takeaway here is that the first two quarters largely offset each other and more importantly, for the year, the results are positive.Through the second quarter, we experienced a 55-basis-point increase in 10-year treasury rates and only a modest steepening of the yield curve beyond three years. Over that time period, the performance of lower coupon MBS was largely as expected with these coupons modestly outperforming hedges. In addition, very attractive TBA financing levels further benefited these positions and provided a positive boost to earnings. Higher coupon MBS meanwhile underperformed hedges somewhat year to date due to elevated prepayment speeds.Putting the two quarters together, AGNC's year-to-date economic return was positive 2.4%. Importantly, we generated this positive return despite the increase in longer-term interest rates, prepayment speeds remaining stubbornly fast and the Fed beginning to condition the market for an eventual tapering. The repricing of both Fed and prepayment expectations that occurred in the second quarter is healthy for the Agency MBS market. At current valuation levels, the investment backdrop is now more balanced.That said, as the Fed and the market moved closer to asset tapering, some further spread widening and volatility is possible. And while this could pressure our book value in the short run, wider spreads are a welcome development over the long run as they improve the expected return on new investments and enhance the earnings profile of our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bernie to review the financial results for the quarter.Bernie Bell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Peter. Tangible net book value declined 7.5% for the quarter as wider spreads and the underperformance of our higher coupon specified pools, in particular, drove a comprehensive loss of $0.97 per share for the second quarter. Including dividends of $0.36 per share, our economic return on tangible common equity was a loss of 5.5% for the quarter. So far this month, as of.SEE MINUS 5.5% EQUITY FOR 1 QUARTER=HORRIBLE INVESTMENT !"
Gosh according to what I am reading by some folks - if interest rates were to go negative this stock would really go down? Pulling a max chart in months shows as rates went down so did the divi. I think the real question is - will the US see rates negative like Europe?
"BOOK VALUE DECLINES MONTHLY , PLUS ROC FROM AGNC LEAVES LONGS SHORT ON PROFITS ANNUALLY! after taxes."

wave bye bye to another div. so many lost in past couple months. Why the buy back from agnc before the crash= pump and dump. Kain even sold 50k shares. ha ha maybe he knows something. Inst. ownership is way down this year.
"Why does management think interest rates are *really* going to go up this time, when the Fed has been talking about normalization for 13 years and it has never happened?"
Is AGNC now going to repurchase the even more inexpensive company shares. Gotta keep the price up and management options valuable.

"I WARNED ALL ABOUT INST. OWNERSHIP COLLAPSE I WAS CALLED NAMES. WELL HERE'S PROOF BAGHOLDERS !AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) was in 18 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 37. AGNC shareholders have witnessed a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. There were 25 hedge funds in our database with AGNC holdings at the end of December. Our calculations also showed that AGNC isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017"
EPS is 3.51 and divie is 1.44. Seems to me the divie is very safe and is a very reasonable payout amount.

hello guys what do you think about the company? i like the dividend method and the company looks fine to me by fundamentals numbers. something i missing?
There will never be an increase in the dividend. It’s not AGNC’s business model. Reduction in income/earnings year after year only means lower dividends. Simple math. The only cash cow for AGNC is SPOs.
"ANOTHER EXCERPT FROM CEO PETER FEDERICO ON DIVIDENDS FROM THE RECENT EARNINGS TRANSCRIPT...But I did expect that question, particularly because our net spread and dollar roll income continues to be so strong at $0.76 this quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter. What I would share some high-level observations and thoughts on the dividend. First, we're not trying to -- and we've communicated this in the past, we're not trying to achieve a particular dividend outcome. At the end of the day, our goal is very simple, which is to generate the absolute best economic return we can for our shareholders.And further and ideally, we want that economic return to consist of a very attractive dividend and to the extent possible, some book value accretion, we think that combination is appealing to the broadest cross-section of investors. But make no mistake, we are very cognizant of the fact that our dividend is a very important component to a significant portion of our shareholders. In today's market, if you look at our dividend level against our stock price or our book value, we do think we have a very attractive dividend. Our dividend yield on either of those measures is close to 9%, particularly when you view that 9% in the context of asset valuations across any asset class, we think 9% is a really attractive dividend."
REMINDER AGNC STOCK WAS SELLING FOR $18.80 JUST 3 WEEKS AGO. THAT'S A WHOPPING $2.80 LOSS FOR BAGHOLDERS LIKE KEN.
oh look red...again...ssdd. day short is the only profits to be made on this declining asset.
"spike, then crater. spike then crash = day trade gold !"
"Stock goes up for two main reasons: Book Value (BV) and Profitability (EPS). AGNC stock corrected 15% after reaching $18.70, its 52 wks high. Why? Back on March 31, its BV was $17.72 but by Jun 30, its BV dropped to $16.39. In same period, its profit (EPS) went from 1.77 to (0.97) due to losses in hedging against big drop in rate and increased prepayment. Where do we go from here? Based on earning call today, AGNC predicted prepayment stability and higher rate in Q3 & Q4 and hence increased BV and EPS. With its stock price today at $16.04 below its BV of $16.39 and dividend yield of 9%, it's a good entry point here to start your position and add more if it goes down further below $16. But I do not expect anything lower than $15.50 its strong support."
"WOW new alert theres a penny drop today, cover and make your 50 dollars. LMAO most ridicolous thing ive ever seen or heard. Meanwhile stocks like AMZN, FB, NIO, TSLA, MRNA go down 5 to 30 dollars in a day. Oh I get it these LIBRARDS can only afford one share of those mention buy hey whos doing the math, DUHHH well one share at 30 down or even 5 is almost more than they make on the 10 shares of this, except they never account for the $$$$ we make every month, and bTW 52 week high just over 18 so there you have it. Well with you cancel everything culture maybe you never went to school."
"AGNC Loses $1.822 million dollars every day 365, on the very business they scalp the 90% from the investors on. REITS minus $164 million last quarter. Why buy? for 12 cents div. wait it's going down due to new shares out."

"From my reading of the report, the company had a loss of $681 million that included hedging losses from swaps, treasury short positions and interest rate swaptions of 1,005 million. Clever clever risk management once again turned a gain into a loss. Hedging causes big losses 90% of the time year in and year out."

Looking for top paying dividend stocks and found AGNC. The yield is crazy high but the stock price itself hasn't moved much. Where can I see the details of how long AGNC has been paying dividends? Again newbie here.
"Pumpers: “thoughts and prayers” for AGNC. Going to church to light candles. Sorry boys, is that all you’ve got ? Your faith isn’t truth."
LARGE FUNDS HAVE CASHED OUT! 1 hour today equals ALL DAY FRIDAY!
"Interesting to note that all the “longs” , (pumpers), on here, aren’t really longs but traders. They all have a strike price set and can’t wait to bail out. They tell you what a wonderful deal it is to buy AGNC and get the dividends, but the only trade. I’m a true long. A bag holder. I’ve been here for many years for the dividend. I’ve taken a bath on pps and div cuts but have made only a slight profit after taxes with the dividend. I think the company has been poorly run and set up for the board of directors and officers to make millions."
"Longs explain the recent huge BV increase, then the more recent collapse.While you're at it, explain the recent sp. skyrocket, then the more recent collapse. THIS IS A VERY MANIPULATED, VERY HIGH RISK, SCHEME."
Somebody is loading up on AGNC at these prices . Look at the volume they know this is going up the next 6 months IMO.

I've owned agnc for years and won't miss out on this buying opportunity.
"looking for a good monthly dividend stock, currently in PSEC but looking to shift a chunk. Have looked at AFIN and ORC and AGNC. I'm torn by AGNC's loss of dividend and BV but flip side is it might be a good time to float a % into it as long as fed starts climbing interest rates. I have read the posts and would appreciate a rational opinion from a long term watcher. Thanks!!!"
agnc has lost 18% in the past 3 months alone !
This is a shorts dream. Almost in bear territory now. Look at how 2 hours trading today swamped yesterday's 4 cent up. facts. This is a declining asset. And has been for 9 years. period. see a chart. read the sec fin. fil. for this ponsi.

AGNC BOASTS 9 YEARS OF DIVIDEND DECLINES. NEVER 1 INCREASE. FACTBearish
"STAY FOCUSED ON THE FACTS OR MISS A GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY >>>Year-to-date, AGNC has generated a positive economic return of 2.4%. Importantly, this was achieved despite significant interest rate volatility, elevated prepayment speeds, and an accelerated outlook for the normalization of Fed monetary policy. The spread widening that occurred in the second quarter reflects these changing market conditions. As we enter the second half of 2021, we believe that Agency MBS now have a more balanced investment backdrop. With our low leverage profile, AGNC is well-positioned to take advantage of more attractive investment opportunities as they arise.""""AGNC continued to generate strong net spread and dollar roll income in the second quarter of 2021, totaling $0.76 per common share, excluding estimated 'catch-up' premium amortization cost,"" said Bernice Bell, the Company's Chief Financial Officer. ""Favorable short-term funding, attractive TBA dollar roll opportunities, and stable hedging cost drove this favorable earnings performance."
"I have faith in the AGNC team. An allocation every month for AGNC. Unless you're reckless and pile your money into speculative plays, you will always allocate for rock solid enterprises."
"FROM THE MOST RECENT 13F FILING FROM AGNC TO SEC. 13F'S DON'T LIE PUMPERS HERE DO ! LIKE KENDOLL WHO CALLED $25 BY JULY LOL !!!Hedge Funds and other institutional investors have just completed filing their 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing their equity portfolios as of the end of September. At Insider Monkey, we follow nearly 900 active hedge funds and notable investors and by analyzing their 13F filings, we can determine the stocks that they are collectively bullish on. One of their picks is AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC), so let’s take a closer look at the sentiment that surrounds it in the current quarter.AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) was in 18 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 37. AGNC shareholders have witnessed a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. There were 25 hedge funds in our database with AGNC holdings at the end of December. Our calculations also showed that AGNC isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings."
agnc HISTORICALLY TRADES AT 80% OF BOOK VALUE. WHICH IS NOT A VERIFIED VALUE. SO AGNC BOOK OF $16.25 MAKES AGNC MARKET VALUE IN $14'S. PAYOUT IS ONLY 41.5% DUE TO SHRINKAGE. MORE LOSSES ON REITS $400 MILLION LOST JUST LAST QUARTER ON MREITS.!!!!!!!!!!

"AGNC DISCUSS WHEN THE FED. WILL TAPER ON INTEREST RATES FROM AGNC EARNINGS TRANSCRIPT...But let me start with timing. Look, I don't think this is any rocket science, but we see the economy performing very well in the second half of the year, and including the second -- the remainder of this quarter, we think the economy accelerates. We do think there are going to be price pressures. We do generally agree with the Fed that they'll be shorter-term in nature.However, we don't think that they're necessarily going to appear shorter term in nature. In other words, we do feel like the Fed may start to feel pressure over the summer with respect to just growth strength in the economy and add inflationary pressures, which they're going to hope are temporary, but there's going to be concern both in the market and in economic circles that maybe the inflationary pressures will be more lasting. Against that backdrop, we think the Fed is going to have to start talking. Even though right now, they don't want to talk about talking about tapering.They're going to have to start talking about it. And I think an eventual taper will probably begin either at the very end of this year or very early next year. So that's what we see in terms of timing. A couple of things that I just want to reiterate and people, I think, forget this.When they taper, they're going to reduce on a monthly basis, most likely, the amount of mortgages they're adding to their balance sheet. OK? So let's say they did $5 million -- $5 billion a month, that would take them eight months to then -- to not be adding anything to their balance sheet. But what I think people forget is they're still"
"ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION FOR AGNC >>>AGNC Investment Corp.: 8.8% yieldHave I mentioned that the mortgage REIT industry is hitting its stride? In addition to putting your money to work in industry leader Annaly, its veritable sidekick, AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC), has a really good chance to outperform and make its shareholders rich. Since going public roughly 13 years ago, AGNC's yield pretty much hasn't dipped below 8%.Just like Annaly, AGNC has aligned its portfolio to take advantage of agency mortgage-backed securities. Excluding to-be-announced securities, the company held $62.1 billion of agency-backed residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in the first quarter. That compares to less than $500 million in non-agency RMBS and $1.1 billion in credit-risk transfer securities. Without getting overly technical, only around 3% of total assets are in potentially risky long-term assets, which is what's led to a steady stream of dividend income for shareholders."
"Remember those trade imbalances Prince Kahuna was always posting about? Well look at today's chart see the huge spikes during the last hour? Now look at agnc trade volume double yesterday's volume....and that of every green day for couple months now. This is big funds unloading. All the MM's dealers are putting in tiny pop trades to hold it up, but when the real selling starts you will see days like the down $0.66 on 25 million shares in the past 90 days this is down 18%. catch more falling knives, be my guest. Day shorting has slapped these paid pumpers so often they are just dumbfounded, or maybe just simple and dumb. Goes lower on fundies. div. decline coming. Too many preffie shares to pay."
AFTER SO MANY RED DAYS IN A ROW I WAS GLAD FOR A GREEN DAY. I WILL OF COURSE GET THAT TINY 17 CENTS BACK IN THE AM. SSDD.
Seems in the last few months every time it drops into the 15.90 to 15.80 range it presents a good buying opportunity.
"All the pumpers on here don’t really believe AGNC is a well run company. So, they are only here for the volatility. Up, down, up down…buy sell, buy sell."
"9% dividend!!!!! BUY, BUY, BUY!!!"
"Proof of the LOSSES and very POOR performance. Don't buy the non-gaap!Thanks, Katie, and thank you to everyone on the call today. The positive trends that drove the strong performance of Agency MBS in the first quarter, largely reversed in the second quarter. MBS spreads to swap and treasury hedges, particularly longer-term hedges, widened meaningfully in May and June as interest rates rallied and the yield curve flattened. The spread widening coincided with the shift in investor sentiment following strong economic data, which, in turn, pushed the Fed to begin asset tapering discussions.The market now expects the Fed to communicate its plan for asset tapering sometime later this year. In addition, despite the first quarter increase in mortgage rates, prepayment speeds in the second quarter slowed by less than expected. These faster prepayment speeds pressured higher coupon MBS valuations and reversed the significant outperformance that these coupons experienced in the first quarter. Given the shift in sentiment regarding asset tapering and faster-than-expected prepayment speeds, spreads across the coupon stack widened with lower coupon spreads widening five to 10 basis points and higher coupon spreads widening 15 to 20 basis points.As a result, our economic return for the quarter was negative 5.5%. While this result is disappointing, it is also easier to understand when viewed in the context of the first two quarters together. To recap, in the first quarter, 10-year treasury rates increased by more than 80 basis points. The yield curve three years to 10 years steepened by more than 60 basis points and swap spreads widened.Against this backdrop, Agency MBS performed very well. Moreover, higher coupon MBS meaningfully outperformed as investors priced in more benign prepayment expectations given the recent increase in mortgage rates. With our portfolio being well balanced between lower coupon TBAs and higher coupon specified pools, our economic return in the first quarter was positive 8.2%. In the second quarter, however, we experienced a reversal of these conditions.Specifically, 10-year treasury rates rallied close to 30 basis points, the yield curve flattened by almost 40 basis points and longer-term swap spreads tightened. Against this backdrop and given the shift in Fed sentiment following stronger economic data, MBS spreads widened meaningfully. And in contrast to the first quarter, the underperformance was most pronounced in higher coupon MBS. The key takeaway here is that the first two quarters largely offset each other and more importantly, for the year, the results are positive.Through the second quarter, we experienced a 55-basis-point increase in 10-year treasury rates and only a modest steepening of the yield curve beyond three years. Over that time period, the performance of lower coupon MBS was largely as expected with these coupons modestly outperforming hedges. In addition, very attractive TBA financing levels further benefited these positions and provided a positive boost to earnings. Higher coupon MBS meanwhile underperformed hedges somewhat year to date due to elevated prepayment speeds.Putting the two quarters together, AGNC's year-to-date economic return was positive 2.4%. Importantly, we generated this positive return despite the increase in longer-term interest rates, prepayment speeds remaining stubbornly fast and the Fed beginning to condition the market for an eventual tapering. The repricing of both Fed and prepayment expectations that occurred in the second quarter is healthy for the Agency MBS market. At current valuation levels, the investment backdrop is now more balanced.That said, as the Fed and the market moved closer to asset tapering, some further spread widening and volatility is possible. And while this could pressure our book value in the short run, wider spreads are a welcome development over the long run as they improve the expected return on new investments and enhance the earnings profile of our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bernie to review the financial results for the quarter.Bernie Bell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Peter. Tangible net book value declined 7.5% for the quarter as wider spreads and the underperformance of our higher coupon specified pools, in particular, drove a comprehensive loss of $0.97 per share for the second quarter. Including dividends of $0.36 per share, our economic return on tangible common equity was a loss of 5.5% for the quarter. So far this month, as of.SEE MINUS 5.5% EQUITY FOR 1 QUARTER=HORRIBLE INVESTMENT !"
"AGNC opened at $15.56 on January 4. With dividends reinvested, this is what $100,000 has turned into for various popular holdings:AGNC = $106,919O = $115,953JNJ = $110,784QQQ = $116,480SPY = $118,061PFE = $119,817ABBV = $112,383JPM = $121,704You could basically blindfold yourself and throw a dart to come up with a vastly better performing holding.

A quick check of oldest reactions shows NEVERANOTHERTRUMP has been bashing this stock for at least 5 years. Why? Over a 5 year period a 10K investment made 15K with this dividend.

I have a question that is related to this company's monthly dividend. Does the dividend amount change from month to month?
"AGNC trades on the NAS, and it hit a new record today, agnc once sold for $36.00. the div. was $0.50 per month paid ea. q."

Tomorrows conference call should be interesting. Like to see how they are going to spin this
"So I was reading Benjamin Graham's (Warren buffets stock mentor)""the intelligent investor"" today and came across something interesting. He has a chapter on inflation and his recommendations for how to deal with it and which types of stocks to invest in. He didn't recommend gold, oil, big cyclicals, he recommended real estate REITS. I'm in both Agnc or Orc for REITs and definitely was pleasantly surprised to read that today. :)"
DID YOU READ WHAT TERRANCE POSTED=There will never be an increase in the dividend. It’s not AGNC’s business model. Reduction in income/earnings year after year only means lower dividends. Simple math. The only cash cow for AGNC is SPOs.
"Book value now decreases more than 1 per month now. So 9% div. MINUS THE BOOK DECLINES, MINUS THE SHARE PRICE DECLINES, MINUS TAXES, MINUS ROC COSTS, MINUS SO MUCH YOUR 12 CENTS IS A BAD JOKE ON BAGHOLDERS !"
Lol the shorts usual suspects are silent today losing money . This will follow the 10 year note which went up today. If the 10 year note rises for the next 6 months AGNC will see 19$ by December IMO.
agnc has LOST 2 years worth of dividends in just 5 weeks. WOW 24 months of sitting while the global markets set new records.= real dog. And use to pay $6 div. and had a sp. of $36 ahhh the good old days of agnc. Before 9 years of div. cuts. now look !

"ALL THE TRILLIONS OF DEBT THAT THE GOV. IS ADDING WILL ADD TO AGNC FUTURE PROFITS,,,WHY ?,,,BECAUSE THE FED. WILL HAVE TO KEEP THE GOV. INTEREST RATE LOW BECAUSE THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT WILL BE THE LARGEST GOV. OUTLAY...BUT, THE MARKET WILL INCREASE INTEREST RATES ON IT'S OWN BECAUSE OF INFLATION...EVEN A SMALL 1/2 POINT INCREASE WILL HELP AGNC EARNINGS EXPLODE TOWARDS $1.00 A SHARE A 1/4ER...MORTGAGE REITS ARE GOOD FOR LONG TERM INCOME AS A 10% YEARLY INCOME STREAM IS GOOD...YOU BUY A SPEC NON DIV. STOCK AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOU WILL EARN A 10% RETURN OR EVEN BE AT A LOSS A YEAR LATER WITH ZERO INCOME...IF THE MARKET HAS A NEGATIVE MONTH YOU STILL RECEIVE YOUR DIV. FROM AGNC...JUST BUY HOLD COLLECT AND REPEAT...Less"
Look at that great chart. Goes lower on fundies and lack of earnings.-83c
What makes this stock move up or down? What are the catalysts?
RED RED RED
AGNC had been announcing the dividend and tangible book value the second Thursday every month. Not last night. Analysts predict another drop in bv. I turned off my automatic drip thinking the share price will dip after the news. Should get an opportunity for a lower purchase price.
"RED, BACK TO 15. SSDD. SHORTS RULE THIS PONSI."
TOLD YA #$%$ DD.
"Gary Kain dumped 50,000 shares. What’s he know ?"
Loss of $.97 per shareBV dropped to $16.39
BEST DAY SHORT IN THIS SECTOR!
HEY KEN !! YOU MISSED YOUR JULY PRICE TARGET BY $10.00 PER SHARE !
Div holds at .12. Book is at $16.25
"Always entertained by shorts. To any new investor coming to this page for info. The entire sector is getting mauled right now. This, and many others like it, are great buys right now. I have 9 different Reits and track 14 of them. They are All down. It's a fabulous time to buy"
RED RED RED!! SHORT TO WIN.
"Dividend will be slashed due to preffie div. costs and $1.25 BILLION in new shares in the market, all while mgmnt is caught on the wrong side and crushed last q, all while the market is ANTI_HIGH RISK. is agnc still considered an investment, when the co. gambles with shares, while losing money at it's core business? NO it's much more of a casino bet."
"With a net annual return of only 2.4% as we all know, the only REAL money made on agnc is DAY SHORT. SSDD"
Are we going to cross 18 before earnings or after earnings. Anyways I will be enjoying the dividend :)
"Every time this stock drops.12 some idiot posts how I just lost a month’s dividend, but when it goes back up the next day the idiots are silent. The share price is right where it was eight months ago and I’ve gotten $1440 every month in divy. I just don’t see the problem."
"THIS IS WHAT AGNC CEO PETER FEDERICO SAID YESTERDAY ON THE EARNINGS CALL ABOUT AGNC FUTURE...IMO HE IS SPOT ON...IMO IN 12 MONTHS AGNC WILL BE DOING $1.00 A 1/4ER EARNINGS...BUY HOLD COLLECT AND REPEAT OVER AND OVER WHILE AGNC IS BELOW $17.50...If you look forward 12 months from now, likely rates are higher. At some point, the curve is steeper. That's going to be a really good environment for Agency. Likely, we're not going to have to be competing with the Fed for assets.That's another good benefit for the Agency MBS market. So we're going to continue to approach it from that longer-term perspective. We'll have to endure the volatility. You're going to have to be active in rebalancing both your asset and hedge side of the portfolio.In this environment, you'll see us continue to do that. But over the long run, I think we have the right position on. You just going to have to be willing to wait it out and ultimately, I think it's going to lead to a very strong environment for Agency MBS."
"FROM THE MOST RECENT 13F FILING FROM AGNC TO SEC. 13F'S DON'T LIE PUMPERS HERE DO ! LIKE KENDOLL WHO CALLED $25 BY JULY LOL !!!Hedge Funds and other institutional investors have just completed filing their 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing their equity portfolios as of the end of September. At Insider Monkey, we follow nearly 900 active hedge funds and notable investors and by analyzing their 13F filings, we can determine the stocks that they are collectively bullish on. One of their picks is AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC), so let’s take a closer look at the sentiment that surrounds it in the current quarter.AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) was in 18 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 37. AGNC shareholders have witnessed a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. There were 25 hedge funds in our database with AGNC holdings at the end of December. Our calculations also showed that AGNC isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings)."
OK what is very interesting is that the housing prices are going up (Lack of inventory and companies not motivated to build) so the risk of loans not being paid even if property owners fail to make their payments and loose their homes the loans will be covered when the homes are sold. I believe the analysis on interest rates and the spread between mortgages and treasuries seems to be off to sell this stock. Interest rates will rise and this REIT will make money on its holdings. I believe there is the followers that do not do their own analysis and hedge funds and analysis shorting this stock cause it to decline in value. The price compared to book value has already decrease by over 13 percent and the price is below what it was pre-covid. Someone is triggering stop loses and manipulating this stock down. I hold this stock long.
Does anyone notice NLY and this stock has almost exactly the same chart (gain/loss) everyday for past month?
"STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT CEO PETER FEDERICO STATED ON THE RECENT EARNINGS CALL, NOT ON THE BLA BLA BLA OF THE PRINCE OF DOOM WHO IS JUST A DISGRUNTLED SHAREHOLDER THAT BOUGHT HIGH, AND PANIC SOLD LOW BUT WANTS HIS POUND OF FLESH BY BASHING AGNC SHAREHOLDERS...BELOW IS COMMENTS BY CEO PETER FEDERICO...If you look forward 12 months from now, likely rates are higher. At some point, the curve is steeper. That's going to be a really good environment for Agency. Likely, we're not going to have to be competing with the Fed for assets.That's another good benefit for the Agency MBS market. So we're going to continue to approach it from that longer-term perspective. We'll have to endure the volatility.

But over the long run, I think we have the right position on. You just going to have to be willing to wait it out and ultimately, I think it's going to lead to a very strong environment for Agency MBS.IMO WE HAVE THIS LAST OPPORTUNITY TO ADD SHARES ON THE CHEAP SO BUY HOLD COLLECT AND REPEAT THUS COMPOUNDING YOUR MONTHLY AND YEARLY INCOME..."
Another day another month's dividends destroyed in share price. What is going on with this stock it's just been dropping likea rock. I can understand a drop if the stock market was going down and I understand the drop because of book value but this doesn't make any sense.
Book value reduced again and again. Just like dividend=ponsi scam
"AFTER FED CHAIR POWELLS DOVISH SPEECH AT THE JACKSON HOLE CONFERENCE AGNC'S COST OF $ WILL REMAIN REMAIN BETWEEN 0 AND .25%, RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ABOUT .015, THATS LESS THAN 1/4ER POINT...THAT MEANS FOR MORTGAGE REITS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT COST WILL REMAIN STABLE FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 15 MONTHS...AGNC SHOULD HAVE AN EXCELLENT PROFIT SPREAD GOING FORWARD...ALL WE NEED IS MARKET INTEREST RATES TO GO UP A 1/2 POINT ON THE 30 YEAR BOND AND AGNC WILL BE EARNING $1,00 A SHARE PER 1/4ER BECAUSE OF STABLE INTEREST COSTS AND AN EXPANDED PROFIT SPREAD..."
"Stock market tanking days on end, AGNC stable. No wonder the 4 clowns are on welfare. SAD"
Well agnc is certainly a dog in a record market. No more govt. welfare to support the value so short again and again.
"Experts report on AGNC= short to win $$$...read and learn.is trading right around its book value per share of $16.39 and has a dividend yield of 8.9%. The entire mortgage REIT space will be under a cloud while the Fed contemplates reducing or suspending its MBS purchases. In this environment, it makes sense to wait for these stocks to trade at a significant discount to book value (7% to 10%) before stepping in."
"AGNC's June 30, 2021 tangible net book value per common share will be announced concurrently with the Company's second quarter earnings release, which is scheduled for July 26, 2021."
"Haven't we been in this situation before? and how did AGNC fare then? and how are they going to do this time? Refer to the MAX chart on AGNC for perspective...see the dramatic drop in share price in 2013. After the crash in 2008 and the bear market of 2007-2009, the Fed held interest rates below .5% from 2008-2015. In 2013 then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announced the asset purchases would wind down. The Fed reduced the asset purchases and then started to raise the rate in 2015. Look at the chart to see how the AGNC share price moved to these actions. Will AGNC do better and how are they going to do it?"
"In case you thought the earnings news was good?? Here's the horse's words:Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Higher coupon Agency MBS, the strongest performers in the first quarter, were the weakest performers in the second quarter as the decline in prepayment speeds that many had anticipated from higher mortgage rates did not materialize. Lower coupon generic Agency MBS also modestly underperformed hedges due primarily to evolving expectations about the timing of the Federal Reserve's eventual tapering of its Agency MBS purchases. As a result of these factors, AGNC's economic return in the second quarter was negative 5.5%.SO REALLY BAD NEWS FOR LONGS!!! poor management caveat emptor"
Seems like a decent time to pick up some shares.
Buy! Buy! Buy! This stock was as high as $18.84 two months ago.
"ssdd. day shorts win. again, and again. see chart."
DROPS INTO RED AGAIN AND AGAIN= DAY SHORT. THANKS BAGHOLDERS.
