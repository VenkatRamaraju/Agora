"So, every quarter for the past 5 years Mr. Peribere told Wall St. analysts about all the wonderful synergies between Sealed Air and Diversey. And now he says there are no synergies. So, was he lying or just wrong? And what's the penalty for that? Let me guess: a raise, a big bonus and boatloads more stock."

I have gut feeling that SEE is going to be taken over ...the way it trades in huge down days and the volume leads me to believe that there is someone out there accumulating the stock of this company on dips and we may soon hear a 50-55 bid for it . Time will tell.
SEE is up 8.49% to 26.06
Buckle Up! With resin cost going up that mean revenue up and profitability up. Which means SEE is going to be crushing!
SEE is down 5.44% to 27.66
"Thought we would see more of a move on a crushing quarter and lifted yearly projections... But I guess when Dow, S%P and the nasdeq are down 3% I will take a 2% move in the other direction. Still slap a buy on SEE. I project it $47-50 by next earnings call."

Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy) -3.20%Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) 76.50%Overall revenue down because they are losing business Quarterly Earning Growth is from inorganic slice and dice It is all smoke and mirrors Wonder how long Pretty Bear can keep the wheels on the cart until he can't chop and slice anymoreNo real growth here folks just slicing and dicing to put the lip stick on the little piggy So the upper level executive management team can ride off into the sun set with their stock options

So undershot it a bit. Still has upward mobility. I think it will have a run like it did back in 2012. Expect the stock to double in the next two years. Have not been wrong yet. The other stock I like is WRK!

Buy the dip! I have not been wrong on this stock and its still has crazy potential. Lead times are still pushed out and thy have equipment being installed to keep up with demand as we speak. End of Q1 earning will be through the roof!
The king of eCommerce solutions is about to take off. They have announced a 7% price increase on most products. Lead times are still 2-4 times longer than normal. This earning call well be good but Q4 will be better. Buy Buy Buy.

with SEE being a great way to play e commerce I would think someone like Warren Buffet would make a play to buy this company
"A simple lower high... trend is still bearish... many will cry tomorrow... whoever is long didn't sell 3 days ago on the CRON obvious top signal got lucky with S&P 500 rallying this long/extended/far/due to unexpected Trump optimism on the markets + geopolitical moving well.You got lucky. But in a way not really - a simple lower high, pattern and trend remains the same.I will buy Canopy @ CAD$48 because that's where the trend line is... don't believe me... open up a chart then draw a trend line across the two recent super lows. Don't fight what the market/stock is doing - stocks always fall to the lane of least resistance, and the lane of least resistance is the many averages + supports that must be re-tested.#see you all @ CAD$48. for the next run."

Buy Diversey - global sales of 3.2 billion - for $4.3 billion and sell it five and half years later for $3.2 billion - now with global sales of 2.6 billion. Probably a good idea to focus on your core business.
