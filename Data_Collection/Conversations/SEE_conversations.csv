"#SEE Looking better to the upside after some consolidation, according to stoxline. A break of 45.39 could move it up to 53.02."
Buckle Up! With resin cost going up that mean revenue up and profitability up. Which means SEE is going to be crushing!

This is a strong buy! They have two main business food and packaging. A majority of people still eating at home there food business is strong. As for packaging they make all mailers and everything that goes in a box besides the product you order. Oh yeah and they make all of Amazon's mailer.

So undershot it a bit. Still has upward mobility. I think it will have a run like it did back in 2012. Expect the stock to double in the next two years. Have not been wrong yet. The other stock I like is WRK!
Recent study finds that 20% of CEO's are psychopaths. SEE employees think its 100%.

The king of eCommerce solutions is about to take off. They have announced a 7% price increase on most products. Lead times are still 2-4 times longer than normal. This earning call well be good but Q4 will be better. Buy Buy Buy.

"almost 52 wk low @ 39.12, enter point?"
"Thought we would see more of a move on a crushing quarter and lifted yearly projections... But I guess when Dow, S%P and the nasdeq are down 3% I will take a 2% move in the other direction. Still slap a buy on SEE. I project it $47-50 by next earnings call."
with SEE being a great way to play e commerce I would think someone like Warren Buffet would make a play to buy this company
SEE reached a new 52 Week Low at 40.80
"A simple lower high... trend is still bearish... many will cry tomorrow... whoever is long didn't sell 3 days ago on the CRON obvious top signal got lucky with S&P 500 rallying this long/extended/far/due to unexpected Trump optimism on the markets + geopolitical moving well.You got lucky. But in a way not really - a simple lower high, pattern and trend remains the same.I will buy Canopy @ CAD$48 because that's where the trend line is... don't believe me... open up a chart then draw a trend line across the two recent super lows. Don't fight what the market/stock is doing - stocks always fall to the lane of least resistance, and the lane of least resistance is the many averages + supports that must be re-tested.#see you all @ CAD$48. for the next run."
Sealed Air reached a 52 Week high at 45.36
LOL looks like they deleted my last post... Said buy back when it was $43 and some change and said it would be between $47 and $50 by next earnings call. Stock is still going nowhere but up!

I have gut feeling that SEE is going to be taken over ...the way it trades in huge down days and the volume leads me to believe that there is someone out there accumulating the stock of this company on dips and we may soon hear a 50-55 bid for it . Time will tell.
