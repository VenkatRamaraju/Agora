"The new Biogen's BAN2401 trial data collaborate well with accumulating Aducanumab data to support the theory that amyloid-beta plaque formation and tau entanglement are responsible for Alzheimer's disease. The root cause may be mutation or infection. Some think amyloid theory is wrong because many trials testing Mabs (removing some amyloid-beta from the brain) failed to show efficacy in the statistically significant fashion. However, the drug tested by Lilly binds to the amyloid-beta monomers and the drug is wasted in the blood stream even before it crosses the blood-brain barrier. BAN2401 binds to oligomers and Aducanumab was made to bind specifically to both soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils of amyloid-beta (NATURE vol. 537, p50, 2016). These are precursor entities to form the plaque. Another reason for difficulty to prove amyloid theory is ApoE4. This protein which is needed for cholesterol metabolism in the brain was shown to cause amyloid to aggregate.Amyloid-beta is made in the liver cells as well as in the brain cells. It will be desirable to eliminate much of amyloid-beta and ApoE4. So far, Mab such as BAN2401 and Aducanumab alone could achieve only small efficacy even at the highest doses. If RNA sources of ApoE4 as well as of amyloid beta are controlled by RNAi, alzheimer's disease might be controlled. The difficulty with monoclonal antibody alone is that only 2 out of 1000 monoclonal antibodies can cross the blood-brain barrier. Alnylam has the plan to attack CNS targets that includes alzheimer's. Before this year is over, Alnylam will be choosing a CNS target."

"The Cover Story of Barron's contains a paragraph mentioning Alnylam:[[Alnylam, my third pick, is pursuing a technology that’s kind of the opposite of Moderna’s. Messenger RNA sends instructions to cells to make certain proteins. Alnylam’s technology, RNA interference, or RNAi, turns off the production of certain proteins. Alnylam is probably the most innovative company in this space. It has launched three wholly owned drugs targeting rare diseases that are generating hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales. Now, the company is going after more-common diseases and conditions, including high cholesterol, in partnership with Novartis [NVS], and high blood pressure. Soon, we may be able to deliver RNAi drugs for the masses. It could become a commonly used modality.]]"

"http://investors.alnylam.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alnylam-presents-new-clinical-results-apollo-phase-3-studyThis press release reported last Wednesday (3/18) contains the following statement:[[ With up to 48 months of treatment, there were 11 deaths in the Global OLE study, with four events (2.9 percent) occurring in patients previously receiving patisiran and seven events (14.3 percent) in patients previously receiving placebo; causes of death were consistent with natural history and none were considered related to study drug.]]OLE stands for [open-label extension study]. Some die during up to 4 years of treatment. But among Patisiran treated patients only 2.9% died, while among patients switched from placebo to Patisiran after the regular dosing trial is over as many as 14.3% died despite 12 mos. of treatment. This fact suggests that without late intervention of Patisiran more than 14.3% would have died. Disease progression without intervention about 50% of cardiac patients die during 4 years after diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment helps."

"Watch for development of ALN-APPCurrently, it is being developed for hCAA (= hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Most hCAA are known to be caused by mutated APP (= Amyloid precursor protein). This study may open the door into the treatment for the more common sCAA (sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and even Alzheimer’s disease (= AD). AD is also known to be caused by specific APP mutations (Nature Vol. 563, p. 639; Nov. 29, 2018). Read Slide #15 in ER presentation; click the link below.http://investors.alnylam.com/static-files/4cacb555-348e-41c7-9e5e-4b5f1813fc8aThere are 5.7 million (2018 statistics) AD patients in the US alone and the cost to care for them is $277 B ($48.6 K /person/year). But the cost will balloon to $1.1T in 2050 if there is NO treatment to stabilize the progression or cure. Biogen’s Aducanumab removes amyloid-beta plaques and Ph.1 study and its ole study appear to slow down the progression slightly at the highest dose. The key has to be the removal of the root causes where mutated APP is just one."

"Question for all ALNY investors: In 6 weeks the future of ALNY will be decided by a FDA decision for Patisarin. The only thing anyone should care about now (in my opinion) is if the insiders are buying or selling.

The question is, do you guys know if the insiders are buying or selling ??"

The shares looked undervalued before and still look undervalued now, but there is still significant pipeline risk (do the drugs work, and work safely?) as well as commercialization risk, as Alnylam’s drugs target rare diseases where patient identification can be challenging and where there are competitors looking to grab their piece of the market. In any case, I still believe Alnylam is a good stock to consider for those investors willing and able to take on the risk.]]"
"Horrible ALNY news. Ever wonder why ALNY has been dropping for 5 days straight ? Here's the reason. It's pretty bad....Alnylam (ALNY) Lower as Nomura Highlights ONPATTRO Cardiac Concerns in New FDA DocSeptember 12, 2018 9:36 AM Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALNY) is lower off the open after Nomura/Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) just released on the ONPATTRO NDA review document raises cardiac concerns.Marair commented, ""The 485-page document contains FDA analyses of the NDA submission, including: imbalances in mortality, the nature of cardiac events that occurred in the APOLLO trial, and the lack of efficacy data in cardiac patients. The document highlights FDA reviewers’ concerns over cardiac deaths in patients treated with ONPATTRO and suggests that the drug should be limited to patients with polyneuropathy ONLY (i.e., not patients with cardiac manifestations and polyneuropathy). Furthermore, we believe some comments on the lack of cardiac efficacy call into question claims made by ALNY in this regard. We see negative read-through to potential ONPATTRO use in cardiac TTR patients. Additionally, we note that PFE will be able to reference the FDA’s comments on ONPATTRO’s safety concerns and lack of efficacy in cardiac patients while marketing tafamidis to cardiologists.""""In our view, the ONPATTRO review document highlights greater risk for ALNY’s ONPATTRO/TTRsc02 trials, a limited market opportunity in TTRcardiomyopathy, and a potential platform safety risk.""The firm reiterated a Reduce rating and price target of $73.00For an analyst ratings summary and ratings history on Alnylam Pharmaceuticals click here.

"BIG revelation out of AHA on inclisiran (owned by MDCO and licensed from ALNY), and I believe that this is good news for Arrowhead. @AndyBiotech just tweeted that data for inclisiran is ""not too hot for $MDCO $ALNY PCSK9"" because ""CV death and MI/stroke both trending in the wrong direction"". Feel free to look it up on Twitter and check it out. How, you ask, is this good for Arrowhead?You'll be happy to know that I predicted this exact news 6 weeks ago and discussed it in detail on this message board, as I brought it up in my one-on-one interview with Dr. Bruce Given. I initially discussed PCSK9 knock-down (KD) with a top cardiologist that has extensive experience with PCSK9. She said that PCSK9 drugs do NOT have a pleiotropic effect like statins do, particularly when it comes to addressing inflammatory properties, like hsCRP or Lp(a). She believes that CV (cardiovascular) risk will be reduced by KD Lp(a), as that has inflammatory properties that affect CV risk. Big winners out of this include IONS AKCA NVS with their AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx drug, designed to KD Lp(a), and ARWR and AMGN with AMG 890, designed to KD Lp(a).The relevant quote from my post 6 weeks ago (feel free to look back through my history):""One topic of discussion I had with Bruce was with Arrowhead's cardiovascular (CV) drugs, ARO-APOC3, ARO-ANG3, and AMG 890. I conducted some extensive research in this area, including talking to a top cardiologist at a teaching hospital. What I'm about to reveal has not been discussed by any other analyst and can eventually have an impact on companies with PSCK9 drugs, like inclisiran. I asked this cardiologist about PCSK9 inhibitor drugs, as well as her opinion on inclisiran. Her response surprised me. She told me that while PCSK9 drugs can lower cholesterol, they do not low heart attack risk. She said that PCSK9 drugs do not have a pleiotropic effect like statins do. That means that statins are able to reduce more than just cholesterol, and that includes hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein). She observed that patients that were only on PCSK9 drugs did not have a lower risk of heart attacks, and that heart attack re-occurrence did not go down. One thing she pointed to is that PSCK9 do not lower hsCRP levels, and that this is one indicator that has shown to reduce heart attacks if it can be reduced. She therefore makes sure that her patients stay on statins even if they're also on PCSK9 drugs.I think this revelation can be quite significant, as over time it will be interesting to see how inclisiran fares in reducing heart attacks. Getting an opinion from a cardiologist in the field is eye-opening, as most analysts with their fancy PhDs are typically short-sighted and only rely on their own expertise in doing their analysis. I am therefore really looking forward to seeing Dr. Ira Goldberg speak on the 18th, as the opinion of doctors that prescribe the medications is critical in being able to launch a drug successfully. With regards to CV drugs, the cardiologists quickly figure out what works and what doesn't, and so far PCSK9 drugs alone have not shown a reduction in heart attack risk. In the end that will significantly affect the bottom line sales.""-------------------------""I Have Spoken."" The Mandalorian, 2019."

"From Barron's[[ The biotech giants are hungry. That’s the view of JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov, who in a new report out Wednesday laid out the case that investors should be looking out for major acquisitions by the big biotech firms like Amgen (ticker: AMGN), Gilead (GILD), and Biogen (BIIB).“We think it’s only a matter of time before large cap biotech pulls the trigger on meaningful transactions,” Kasimov wrote.For investors, it couldn’t come a moment too soon.The stocks of Amgen, Gilead, and Biogen are trailing the market. With the S&P 500 up 18.8% over the past two years, Amgen is up just 5.9% over the same period, while Biogen, rocked in March by the failure of a promising Alzheimer’s drug, is down 11%. Gilead, for its part, has yet to recover from its late-2018 slump, and is off 0.6% over the past two years. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has gained 5.2% during the same period.Meanwhile, as Kasimov argues, the drug development pipelines of these three remaining biotech heavy hitters are running thin. The failure of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug introduces significant uncertainty for the firm. Gilead’s drug targeting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, meanwhile, had disappointing trial results in April. And Amgen is facing competition and delays on some of its new products.Despite their struggling share prices, the big three remaining biotech firms have plenty of cash available to fund big acquisitions. Gilead leads the pack, according to Kasimov’s figures, with $30 billion in cash, plus a free cash flow of $43 billion over the next five years. All told, Gilead, Amgen, and Biogen taken together have $61 billion in cash, and a free cash flow of $112 billion through 2023.That sets the table for some big moves. From Kasimov’s perspective, the firms don’t have much of a choice.“We simply don’t see enough pipeline optionality wherein large cap biotechs can thrive without engaging in M&A,” Kasimov wrote. ........... ]]"

In addition to the aforementioned early-stage amyloidosis candidates, the company will have data in 2019 from a Phase I single ascending dose study of ALN-AAT02 for alpha-1 antritrypsin deficit. Alnylam has been working on its AAT program for some time, with the first candidate failing due to some safety issues, and this is the first compound going into the clinic with Alnylam’s newest ESC+ molecule technology (which is meant, in part, to have fewer off-target side effects)."

Within it they state that they believe that they will be a top 5 biopharma in the next 3-5 years, and to expect 2-4 INDs per year, all while continuing to be an RNAi company. I do not disagree with these statements, and that can only mean that other RNAi players, like Arrowhead and Dicerna, will be in the mix as well.If you haven't seen the presentation, check it out - it's well worth it, as it shows how expansive the opportunity is for RNAi companies.

Avg 140. What is a good price to sell?
There is nothing wrong. Dont let it bother you. I have tens of thousands of shares and I am not worried. The stock brokers with millions of shares do this from time to time to lower the stock value so they can swoop in to buy back shares cheap and then sell for high. What they do is they sell a few shares at a time a super low prices to drive the stock down and they wait. Low and behold the stock prices go down creaing their opportunity. It costs them a lot to do this but the profit is in the millions per day so it is well worth it for them. My advice is to hold.

"The Medicines Company and Alnylam are co-developing Inclisiran for reducing heart attack, or stroke, or coronary bypass surgery by knocking down PCSK9, thereby reducing LDL cholesterol in blood. The CEO of MDCO recently said: [[ … As of last week, more than 2,750 patient years of inclisiran safety data have been accumulated in the ORION program. Our ongoing review of blinded data to-date from the Phase III trials, as well as data from the ORION-1 Phase II extension trial showed no material safety issues and data that are at least as favorable as those generated and published from the ORION-1 Phase II trial.]]In Phase II trial (500 participants) for Inclisiran to treat hypercholesterolemia demonstrated outstanding results as reported early last year. The degree of knockdown is similar to mAb PCSK inhibitors (mAbs lower CV risks by a quarter). It is just as effective as the mAb PCSK inhibitor, Repatha (from Amgen) or Praluent (from Regeneron), in reducing LDL C, but more convenient to receive because it takes just two subcutaneous injections a year and does not require refrigeration.

"Just look at the ""positive"" write up on Seeking Alpha below:Givosiran is likely to be Alnylam’s next approved drug, assuming that the data from the Phase III ENVISION study are positive. Top-line data should be available in the first quarter of 2019, with full data around midyear. Alnylam expects to finish its rolling NDA submission around midyear, creating the possibility of a late 2019 approval in the U.S. In terms of clinical data, the drug’s ability to reduce annualized attack rates will be the primary efficacy metric, but the real issue is what the safety data look like, as an earlier interim look at the numbers saw high serious adverse events (double the placebo rate) and a discontinuation due to elevated liver enzymes. As mentioned above, Alnylam is using its Alnylam Act program to identify potential patients, with 28 AHP+ mutations id’ed from 224 samples submitted so far from 164 participating doctors._____Can you read?"
I like where this is headed. Just need to get back to $70 so I can be even again. :)

Geneticists at $REGN discovered a gene called GPR75 is essentially a obesity gene. Carriers of variants of the gene is less likely to be obese. RNAi is the best technology to inactivate the gene without causing off-target effects.

"Barry Greene, RNA biotech Alnylam Pharmaceuticals president, said: “It’s a highly capital-intensive business, it’s pretty hard to do without the public markets. So, I believe that black and white, if investors can make money, the IPO market’s going to stay because we certainly need it to be there.“I’ve said this for almost 30 years: for biotech to be successful, four things have to be in place:There needs to be the ability to fund the company, capital needs to be there;there needs to be a transparent regulatory environment;you have to be able to get paid for your medicines if you create them;pharma has to be starved for innovation and really want innovative companies, either as deals or acquisitions."
"Inclisiran. Still waiting on FDA for US approval, so minimal sales I would guess, but from Alnylam IR:Novartis launched Leqvio in parts of Europe earlier this year. We expect Q2 to be the initial quarter of booking our royalties on sales of Leqvio."
Reality: Sounds like Sanofi threw the drug back to ALNY. Too Limited a market to bother with the costs of a worldwide sales push. Hemophilia drug has much greater worldwide customer base. ALNY doesn't have the marketing to handle worldwide coverage and IONS lead in the space and will never generate enough on this to offset costs..Two sided to every story. IMHO
so a 18% drop solely based on Pfizer late stage results. Not sure this significant drop is warranted solely based on that.
Give up
My calculation shows ALNY should be around $30 per share.

"Be glad you can buy ALNY this cheap right now. When it comes to RNAi treatments, the only thing that has to change from treating one disease to another is the carrier molecule which is a sugar or protein. Once Givo is out they will have the ability to crank out various treatments very quickly, several a year. Treating rare diseases allows them to charge between $400,000 to $500,000 per patient per year. Around 2,500 people will be taking Givo and that is just 1 disease so I'm sure you all can do the math. Buy lots and buy long...this will be the Google of pharmaceutical companies"

"Survival benefit among APOLLO participants can be found in the table on Page 24 of presentation:http://investors.alnylam.com/static-files/d73fa440-cc1d-4a16-a3ba-f43ee86d203fThe number of participants is not large, but one can make an important conclusion.The number of people receiving placebo was 77 at the start. However, during the trial 20 people either discontinued or withdrawn from the trial. Since they didn’t know what happened to these 20 people, one should remove these 20 people from the original starter to find a more accurate surviving fraction: 77 – 20 = 57.Number of deaths in this placebo arm was 6 in 1.5 yrs. Then,% death in 1.5 yrs.: 6/(77-20) = 6/57 = 10.5%The Patisiran arm was larger; 148 people started but 14 people either discontinued or withdrawn.Since the event of deaths was 7 in 1.5 yrs,% death in 1.5 yrs. is: 7/(148 - 14) = 7/134 = 5.2%The benefit: 50% improvement; 10.5% 5.2%OLE interim data also support Patisiran effect of greater longevity.http://investors.alnylam.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alnylam-presents-new-clinical-results-apollo-phase-3-studyWith up to 48 months of treatment, there were 11 deaths in the Global OLE study, with four events (2.9 percent) occurring in patients previously receiving patisiran and seven events (14.3 percent) in patients previously receiving placebo."

"For those non-believers....PART 1Dinner W/ Mgt . Says Much Ado About Nothing On Concerns Following Recently Released Onpattro Approval Package By FDA MS / Sept 17, 2018 FDA documents highlighted in process deliberations on safety & patient deaths but mgt. indicates that any concerns held by agency were not broached with company and never made it to the labeling. This suggests that the agency believed that risks were not substantial enough a concern. Dinner with management relieves cardiac concerns that arose last week followingrelease of the Onpattro Approval Package by the FDA:Last week, we hosted Alnylam mgt. for a dinner during their attendence at the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference. During the dinner, mgt. discussed the recent release of the Onpattro (patisiran) approval package, which contained commentary regarding safety that contributed to volatility in the shares. After our discussions, their presentation at the conference as well as Friday morning's release of exploratory cardiac data on Onpattro via its publishing in the journal Circulation, we see it as unlikely that cardiac safety should be a concern for Onpattro. Although we have yet to project sales numbers for Onpattro in the hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) population, we expect that last week's noise will not impact uptake in hATTR with polyneuropathy population who have cardiac symptoms. Attending the conference and dinner were Chief Executive Officer John Maraganore, PhD and Chief Medical Officer Pushkal Garg, MD. Document's commentary on cardiac safetyevents represents in process FDA deliberations, but not conclusions:Last week, investors cited concerns following a read of the FDA's /Drug Approval Package' for Onpattro (find ithere). As part of the FDA Application Review Files can be found the 'Multi-Discipline Review/Summary, Clinical, Non-Clinical (find ithere).' In the safety discussion – which begins on page 18 – the document addresses patient deaths from the PhIII APOLLO trial. Alnylam stock has been under pressure due to the disproportionate number of cardiovascular heart failure deaths noted in the Onpattro arm versus the number observed in the placebo arm (7 to 1) (Exhibit 1). In the text of the FDA's document, A reviewer suggests this differential is 'concerning'. However, the numbers are not high enough to be considered for the labeling. When this death imbalance with regards to heart failure is juxtaposed versus the PhIII ENDEVOUR trial for revusiran in cardiomyopathy – which was discontinued to a mortality imbalance favoring placebo – investors became concerned that the large hATTR-CM and wild type TTR populations could potentially be contraindicated."

"Here's why ALNY is down today . From Seeking Alpha Alnylam down 3% on early-stage givosiran data in AHPApr. 16, 2018 10:49 AM • SA Editor Douglas W. HouseAlnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY -2.9%) is down, albeit on light volume, on the heels of its announcement of new data from its open-label extension studies of RNAi therapeutic givosiran in patients with acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs). The results were presented at the International LIver Congress in Paris.Treatment with givosiran lowered aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the primary toxin in AFPs, and a compound called porphobilinogen (PBG) which led to an 83% decrease in annualized attack rate (AAR) compared to placebo. The average reduction in AAR was 93% in patients treated in the Phase 1 study who continued treatment in the extension portion (n=11/12).Investors appear disappointed that the higher monthly dose of givosran (5.0 mg/kg) did not lower ALA and PBG levels further compared to the lower dose (2.5 mg/kg). Also, the monthly regimen was more effective than the quarterly regimen dashing hopes for less-frequent administration.The other bit of bad news was one case of a serious allergic reaction to givosiran after the third dose. The situation was resolved but the patient withdrew from the study.Enrollment in the Phase 3 ENVISION trial is proceeding with interim data expected mid-year. If positive, the company intends to file a U.S. marketing application."

"ONPATTRO is the best drug to treat hATTR polyneuropathy In his editorial, Buxbaum wrote that the trials that we and Benson et al. reported on were similar in design and outcome measures. However, APOLLO was unique in that it showed benefits of patisiran on prespecified hierarchically tested secondary end points that assessed motor strength, disability, gait, modified body-mass index, and autonomic symptoms. Also unique to the trial was an analysis involving the subgroup of patients with cardiac involvement, the results of which suggested a treatment effect on cardiac structure and function. In response to Buxbaum’s statement that “at best only 56% of participants had a response to any treatment,” we would respectfully point out that in a prespecified threshold analysis, we observed improvement relative to baseline impairment (according to the mNIS+7) in 56% of patients who received patisiran versus 4% of those who received placebo (see Fig. 2D of our article, available at NEJM.org).A post hoc analysis involving patients who were randomly assigned to receive patisiran and who did not have improvement relative to baseline supported less progression of neuropathy in these patients than in those who received placebo (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). These findings indicate a treatment effect in the majority of patients.https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1810994?query=TOC"

"PART - IILet's have a dose of perspective: The specific documents in question are in house (FDA's house) deliberations of a drug's dataset. They do not represent the agency's conclusions. It is the FDA's responsibility to vet and fully scrutinize each aspect of a dataset. If the concerns rise to a substantive level, the company will be engaged in the subject matter and if the company cannot resolve the concern it would be likely that a black box warning for cardiac toxicity would be included in the label. This did not occur. In fact, this line of commentary was never broughtup to management during the entire deliberative process for the NDA application. In other words, the concerns regarding cardiac toxicity were examined and mostly dismissed internally by the agency. This would likely be because the actual mortality imbalance heavily favored Onpattro who had seven patient deaths (of 148 enrolled in this arm) as compared to 6 deaths on placebo (of 77) (Exhibit 1).Further accentuating this, is that there were many more discontinuations on placebo than Onpattro. Outright cardiovascular deaths between the two arms (including stroke) were essentially even, 7 on drug versus 3 on placebo. To take matters one step further, this was a randomized trial for a highly heterogenous population that includes numbers mutations of varying levels of severity. The Onpattro arm had a disproportionate number of patients with non-V30M mutations, which are considered to be more aggressive than most included in this trial. 4 of the 7 of the patients that died from the Onpattro arm had T60 ALA mutation or a Glu 89 Gln mutation, which are also considered to be aggressive. Though weare not concerned on cardiac safety, ALN-TTRsc02 needed for cardiomyopathy market penetration: Although we are not concerned regarding the safety related noise from last week, we do not expect that Onpattro will get substantial use in hATTR-CM patients. In order to maximize penetration into this population, we hold the view that Alnylam will need to build its dataset demonstrating efficacy in these patients through follow-on ALN-TTRsc02. A PhIII trial for ALN-TTRsc02should begin later this year,examining the drug for hATTR with polyneuropathy. A PhIII trial to examine ALN-TTRsc02for hATTR with cardiomyopathy and wild type TTR is set to begin in the future. However, mgt. wants to conduct this trial against tafamidis. As such, this trial is not likely to begin until after tafamidis is approved. Mgt. is also considering a third PhIII trial which would examine ALN-TTRsc02in patients with earlier diagnosed disease. A handful of catalysts on tap: A busy couple months are ahead for the company. Mgt.has indicated that Onpattro has already achieved first sales;although, expectations for 3Q18 numbers should be held in check. When Alnylam reports earnings in November, mgt. will announced the number of completed Onpattro start forms. This should allow us some insight into the drug's early launch. Before the end of this month, we expect to see interim PhIII data from the ENVISION trial examining givosiran for hepatic porphyrias. Sufficient ALA reduction seen in this study could provide the basis for an early FDA submission, although with final data expected 1H19, timingupside is minimal. Beyond givosiran,a competitive decision for Ionis's Tegsedi for hATTR-PN is expected by October 6. We continue to expect approval for the competitor. Although with Ionis's recent receipt of a complete response letter for Waylivra, investors are a bit more unsure on Tegsedi's fate."

Maraganore noted that the ACE2 program is just one of the Covid-19 programs Alnylam and Vir are working on; one of their other efforts would use RNA interference to attack the virus directly.And Maraganore also said he hoped that all the attention now being paid to ACE2 and other antiviral programs would continue even after the worst of the pandemic has passed....https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-ace-2-receptor/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&utm_campaign=b4124406eb-RO_COPY_04&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-b4124406eb-150187573
Can someone please tell me why this is down premarket when they just one FDA approval and what is the outlook for eow?
trading at 435
now time to load up more
IBD is referencing some patent dispute between ALNY and a Portuguese company.
"Juno (9B), AveXis (8.7B), Tesaro (5.1B), all gone last year, and this year: Loxo (8B), Celgene (74B), Spark (5B) will disappear from trading. What do they have in common when the buyouts were triggered? Extremely low share prices. It will be a steal if a big pharma acquire Alnylam even at a triple of current price."
"I like this article: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4227135-alnylam-pharmaceuticals-tries-rally-troops-blizzard-new-r-and-d-candidatesFunny, I saw no mention of this ""amazing"" stock (ARWR) so many people are pumping on this board. LOL.Hoping January numbers look promising."
"patisiran is great drug but I don't know that it justifies $12B of market cap. Their hemophilia drug has competition in the form of gene therapy that offers a one-time treatment to cure. I really like ALNY, ...it's just expensive ...then again, lots of expensive companies in this market ..."
I just added to my position @ 80.00
This one is going to close $12 up don’t sell cheap
"I think this is more than just Sanofi bailing out. This has been sustained over the past month. Whatever the reason, the trend here is clear. Look out below."
"Well, $145 seems like a logical place for some resistance to the move up. This is about a 50% retracement of the move down from $165 to $120. Let's see how long it hangs around here and whether it can move toward the highs, or maybe if it starts back down, the chart will look like a head and shoulders top."
"Sold 1/3 of position, thinking this has peaked for time being. Big profit, will buy on major dip............GLTA"
markets look shaky .... alny great long term ..short term things could get rough ...
What you guys recommend?i should hold or sell ?
time to bend over shorties
"i think big pharma wants to feel out how successful some gene therapy drugs will be given the pricing. Once they have a sense of things, we could see some M&A activity in the space. It is a little early to see how that all plays out. I would certainly be a buyer of ALNY if it drops to $6B valuation. That would be a firesale I couldn't resist. As market is rough right now. ..I am patiently on sidelines on this one .."
"they are old and not relevant. ANLY is going down because of their platform. I'm tired of this continuing down trend. I looked a ARWR posting board, they post all day and even into the evening, and relevant. Dont believe me, go look yourself, I'm out today of ALNY and going all in on ARWR to make up my losses. Do your due diligence and then leap yourself."
Praise the Lord for ALNY. I took half my profits off the board last week at 95. Whatever happens on Monday is gravy. Congrats to those that have put years into this stock as I have.
Which stock are the alny money going into? Down huge after hours!
"look at ntec biotechs market cap , they are going to push it higher all day like Nbrv Nabriva"
Stock has been upgraded. What is the sell off about?
$675 Million in additional shares again for Corporate purposes and Clinical trials?. Is this figure right or what?.
This is the perfect moment to buy folks... do not even hesitate!
"With its continued revenues drawn in by successfully treating patients with Parkinson's Alzheimer's MS Autism Concussion Injury and Osteoarthritis, VODG continues to move forward with it's stemcell therapies, as FDA approval on 2 of it's products are drawing close to completion."

ALNY is in a trade secret battle with Dicerna. It's going to court. https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/04/16/tradesecrets/1fe4vZ3jQUWd6cLX4XYYvJ/story.html?s_campaign=8315
Just listened to the B of A ML Healthcare Conference webcast.... adding to my position tomorrow and not selling a single share for less than $200 per. AMAZING upside and management's confidence in FDA approval by August is off the charts!
I think unfortunately we're headed to the 60's
"Public offering in April for $77.50,New partner bought share at $90Still price today $67,90"
When will AMRN approval come in?Early FDA drug approvals in recent weeks:$GBT Oxbryta (3 months ahead of PDUFA)$ALNY Givlaari (3.5 months early)$NVS Adakveo (2 months early)$BGNE Brukinsa (3 months early)$VRTX Trikafta (5 months early)
buyer beware.. insiders netted 48 million insider sales since September. the stock crashed a few days after JPM UPGRADED ...while being bankers for an offering of 675000000 additional shares......is this legal?
Something going on!!! Run up from the low 60 before Christmas to 87+ today ??? Thanks.
A Buy Rating with $200 price target.
Like ALNY and buyout rumors in ARRY could triple price
I guess tomorrow will be a good day for ALNY.BRIEF-Alnylam Presents Positive Phase 3 Results From ILLUMINATE-A Study Of LumasiranBY Reuters
