"Not sure how many of you noticed, Cantor Fitzgerald and Alethia Young put out a $275 price target on $ALNY yesterday, while maintaining a $79 price target for $ARWR. When you calculate the MC, that's valuing Alnylam at a full 4 times more than Arrowhead.Since 2017 Alnylam has introduced 4 new hepatic drugs on its ESC+ platform, and 1 of them (AAT) has been since dropped, and they're still not profitable. In that same time period, Arrowhead has introduced 8 new hepatic drugs and 2 new extra-hepatic drugs on it's TRiM platform (1 of which is currently paused). Is JM really leaving on his own accord? I know it's pretty much taboo to even bring this thought up with such a charismatic and liked individual, but you can't ignore the numbers.Even when you run the risk-adjusted discounted cash flow numbers, makes you wonder how some are coming up with such incredibly massive disparaging numbers, and if there are agendas in place. Eventually Chris will be able to take that framed photo of Rodney Dangerfield down from his office and pass it on to another aspiring biotech."

"The Medicines Company and Alnylam are co-developing Inclisiran for reducing heart attack, or stroke, or coronary bypass surgery by knocking down PCSK9, thereby reducing LDL cholesterol in blood. The CEO of MDCO recently said: [[ … As of last week, more than 2,750 patient years of inclisiran safety data have been accumulated in the ORION program. Our ongoing review of blinded data to-date from the Phase III trials, as well as data from the ORION-1 Phase II extension trial showed no material safety issues and data that are at least as favorable as those generated and published from the ORION-1 Phase II trial.]]In Phase II trial (500 participants) for Inclisiran to treat hypercholesterolemia demonstrated outstanding results as reported early last year. The degree of knockdown is similar to mAb PCSK inhibitors (mAbs lower CV risks by a quarter). It is just as effective as the mAb PCSK inhibitor, Repatha (from Amgen) or Praluent (from Regeneron), in reducing LDL C, but more convenient to receive because it takes just two subcutaneous injections a year and does not require refrigeration.

"Haven't seen much talk about Alnylam's $ALNY Analyst Day today. You can see their slide deck at: https://alnylampharmaceuticalsinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/2263dbc0-a3a8-4304-87d1-ab96467f1444While there may not be many Alnylam fans vs. Arrowhead fans on the message boards, you just gotta love their presentation. Within it they state that they believe that they will be a top 5 biopharma in the next 3-5 years, and to expect 2-4 INDs per year, all while continuing to be an RNAi company. I do not disagree with these statements, and that can only mean that other RNAi players, like Arrowhead and Dicerna, will be in the mix as well.If you haven't seen the presentation, check it out - it's well worth it, as it shows how expansive the opportunity is for RNAi companies. Only a matter of time ..."
ARWR. Key results include the following:One HBeAg-negative patient serocleared HBsAg post ARC-520Mild ALT changes off ARC-520 therapy coincided with sustained host responses in 2/3 HBeAg-positive and 2/5 HBeAg-negative patientsA single dose of ARC-520 in combination with ETV reduced HBsAg for up to 44 weeksMultiple doses of ARC-520 resulted in additional HBsAg reductions in all patients by as much 5.3 Log10ARC-520 in combination with ETV was effective at rapidly suppressing HBV DNA. BINGO!
Will we see sub $100?
"a lot of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is already baked in today's price. The risk of disappointing (execution risk) over time is now greater (read Goldman Sachs' research piece out on November 20th, 2019 with a Hold rating). Zacks also has a hold on it. I'm long the stock but intend to sell asap."

"From Barron's[[ The biotech giants are hungry. That’s the view of JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov, who in a new report out Wednesday laid out the case that investors should be looking out for major acquisitions by the big biotech firms like Amgen (ticker: AMGN), Gilead (GILD), and Biogen (BIIB).“We think it’s only a matter of time before large cap biotech pulls the trigger on meaningful transactions,” Kasimov wrote.For investors, it couldn’t come a moment too soon.The stocks of Amgen, Gilead, and Biogen are trailing the market. With the S&P 500 up 18.8% over the past two years, Amgen is up just 5.9% over the same period, while Biogen, rocked in March by the failure of a promising Alzheimer’s drug, is down 11%. Gilead, for its part, has yet to recover from its late-2018 slump, and is off 0.6% over the past two years. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has gained 5.2% during the same period.Meanwhile, as Kasimov argues, the drug development pipelines of these three remaining biotech heavy hitters are running thin. The failure of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug introduces significant uncertainty for the firm. Gilead’s drug targeting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, meanwhile, had disappointing trial results in April. And Amgen is facing competition and delays on some of its new products.Despite their struggling share prices, the big three remaining biotech firms have plenty of cash available to fund big acquisitions. Gilead leads the pack, according to Kasimov’s figures, with $30 billion in cash, plus a free cash flow of $43 billion over the next five years. All told, Gilead, Amgen, and Biogen taken together have $61 billion in cash, and a free cash flow of $112 billion through 2023.That sets the table for some big moves. From Kasimov’s perspective, the firms don’t have much of a choice.“We simply don’t see enough pipeline optionality wherein large cap biotechs can thrive without engaging in M&A,” Kasimov wrote. ........... ]]"
"conversation between dirk and bikereider on twitter....adds color to apoc3 dosing:$ARWR @RNAiAnalyst I think when you worked in laps a decade ago, you weren’t able to deliver SiRNA in other tissues than the liver. Nevertheless I like to ask: could it be that depth of KD is different in cardiovascular than in liver tissue?Dirk Haussecker @RNAiAnalyst 2h2 hours agosure, RNAi in liver certainly by far most robust. doesn't mean that other tissues cannot achieve sufficient kd to be therapeutic. $ARWR $DRNA $ALNYBikeRieder  @BikeRiederReplying to @RNAiAnalyst$ARWR Curious why @ArrowheadPharma is dosing their new cardiovascular candidate AROAPOC3 at half the dose (200mg) than AROHBV and AROAAT (300 / 400 mg)?"

This is the perfect moment to buy folks... do not even hesitate!
"The Cover Story of Barron's contains a paragraph mentioning Alnylam:[[Alnylam, my third pick, is pursuing a technology that’s kind of the opposite of Moderna’s. Messenger RNA sends instructions to cells to make certain proteins. Alnylam’s technology, RNA interference, or RNAi, turns off the production of certain proteins. Alnylam is probably the most innovative company in this space. It has launched three wholly owned drugs targeting rare diseases that are generating hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales. Now, the company is going after more-common diseases and conditions, including high cholesterol, in partnership with Novartis [NVS], and high blood pressure. Soon, we may be able to deliver RNAi drugs for the masses. It could become a commonly used modality.]]"
"This is the third time I have tried to post this, but Inclisiran was approved by the EU today and it's still expected to be approved in the US by the end of the year."
$ALNY seems to have some problems over there. Getting quite the spanking and I don't think it's over. IMHO
"Cantor Fitzgerald just raised the $ALNY price target to $176 from $159. When the full picture of Vutrisiran safety becomes clear in a year or two, it will break through $200 resistance in my opinion."

"BIG revelation out of AHA on inclisiran (owned by MDCO and licensed from ALNY), and I believe that this is good news for Arrowhead. @AndyBiotech just tweeted that data for inclisiran is ""not too hot for $MDCO $ALNY PCSK9"" because ""CV death and MI/stroke both trending in the wrong direction"". Feel free to look it up on Twitter and check it out. How, you ask, is this good for Arrowhead?You'll be happy to know that I predicted this exact news 6 weeks ago and discussed it in detail on this message board, as I brought it up in my one-on-one interview with Dr. Bruce Given. I initially discussed PCSK9 knock-down (KD) with a top cardiologist that has extensive experience with PCSK9. She said that PCSK9 drugs do NOT have a pleiotropic effect like statins do, particularly when it comes to addressing inflammatory properties, like hsCRP or Lp(a). She believes that CV (cardiovascular) risk will be reduced by KD Lp(a), as that has inflammatory properties that affect CV risk. Big winners out of this include IONS AKCA NVS with their AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx drug, designed to KD Lp(a), and ARWR and AMGN with AMG 890, designed to KD Lp(a).The relevant quote from my post 6 weeks ago (feel free to look back through my history):""One topic of discussion I had with Bruce was with Arrowhead's cardiovascular (CV) drugs, ARO-APOC3, ARO-ANG3, and AMG 890. I conducted some extensive research in this area, including talking to a top cardiologist at a teaching hospital. What I'm about to reveal has not been discussed by any other analyst and can eventually have an impact on companies with PSCK9 drugs, like inclisiran. I asked this cardiologist about PCSK9 inhibitor drugs, as well as her opinion on inclisiran. Her response surprised me. She told me that while PCSK9 drugs can lower cholesterol, they do not low heart attack risk. She said that PCSK9 drugs do not have a pleiotropic effect like statins do. That means that statins are able to reduce more than just cholesterol, and that includes hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein). She observed that patients that were only on PCSK9 drugs did not have a lower risk of heart attacks, and that heart attack re-occurrence did not go down. One thing she pointed to is that PSCK9 do not lower hsCRP levels, and that this is one indicator that has shown to reduce heart attacks if it can be reduced. She therefore makes sure that her patients stay on statins even if they're also on PCSK9 drugs.I think this revelation can be quite significant, as over time it will be interesting to see how inclisiran fares in reducing heart attacks. Getting an opinion from a cardiologist in the field is eye-opening, as most analysts with their fancy PhDs are typically short-sighted and only rely on their own expertise in doing their analysis. I am therefore really looking forward to seeing Dr. Ira Goldberg speak on the 18th, as the opinion of doctors that prescribe the medications is critical in being able to launch a drug successfully. With regards to CV drugs, the cardiologists quickly figure out what works and what doesn't, and so far PCSK9 drugs alone have not shown a reduction in heart attack risk. In the end that will significantly affect the bottom line sales.""-------------------------""I Have Spoken."" The Mandalorian, 2019."

"mike b and ttracer on twitter putting the puzzle together to see if novartis and arwr is a fit:from mike b:$ARWR-This is an important deal for us. Novartis has been working in the RNAi field for over a decade and their developments in proprietary oligonucleotide formatting and modifications are some of the best we've seenWe anticipate this acquisition will provide us expanded freedomArrowhead acquires patents as well as intellectual property rights to Alnylam's RNAi tech, 30 gene targets Novartis has picked from its partnership and a pipeline with three candidates that had generated preclinical data $10M Cash/$25M Stock. I think this was a STEAL. from tsquared: CA seemed to imply years ago (when they initially purchased Novartis’s IP) that they had a favorable relationship. It remains plausible, and if that collaboration occurs, $ALNY Maraganore will never be able to walk back his colorful “phantasmagorical” description of $ARWR $NVSposting for mike b as he has sworn off of the board until we hit a certain target...somewhere in the 20's i believe"

Tafamidis was rejected by the FDA several years ago for treating FAP because of very low benefit. Even today's news states that it reduces death rate and does not stop death. Patisiran was shown to not only arrest the disease progression but also reverse the disease in some cases.
