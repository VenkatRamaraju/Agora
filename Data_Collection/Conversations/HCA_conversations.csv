"Based on the First Care Act, each hospital was to receive approximately 100,000 per bed. HCA has almost 50000 beds. That means they could receive 5 billion dollars if they indeed divid the money according to the original concept. Saw today that the first 30 billion was released to the hospitals in accordance with the amount of medicare funds received (not sure of the time period)"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!

"HCA is dominant in those parts of the country where the Delta variant is prevalent. I can't see how this will end well for them. Here in Florida, the Governor refuses to declare an emergency which would bring in Federal money and help. The last quarter's results were based on a false expectation that we were beyond the crisis, but nothing could be further from the truth. My advice is to sell."
Dividend again in November?
"At the quarterly earnings call it was announced the quarterly dividend would resume, at 48 cents which would be 1.92 annually, and I would expect this to be increased each year. HCA is a well run company."
"I'm sorry, but what does near capacity with Covid-19 patients mean to you? I thought this was a bad investment when daily cases in Florida were 1-2K, and now we are in the 10-15K range? This price is not sustainable nor is their business model under this strain. SELL!"
Fingers crossed for $270-$300 by years end... I think $HCA should branch out and buy $NBRV & $ASXC
what's up?
HCA should buy CYH???
"Thanks for the thumbs down for the one individual who did this. Could this go back to $58? Sure, it could, however, I believe a vaccine will be announced in the next 6-8 weeks, and if that’s the case, people will buy this back to $100+ as people (the market) buy 6-9 months ahead. Vaccine would be in production by Feb/March of next year and so the stock would start reflecting that upon announcement with a huge bounce followed by a rise to over $100 by sometime in June."
Nice jump up in premarket
Is Wall St. ignoring the high debt of companies like HCA? It seems that companies with huge debt levels are being valued as if they have no debt.
Huge gap from July 14 from 217 to 250. If this drops more tomorrow back to 200.
HCA Healthcare is down 5.17% to 246.55
"60 Minutes story, last night, exposing how hospitals are gouging people and companies, drove up stock today. However, it will be short lived, as expose' will bring more regulation, and organized push back from companies. Hospitals are a very iffy business, look at their charts."
What is the short term future of HCA?
"Now is the time to get those elective surgeries done, before the resurgence of the virus. This quarter should be OK, and maybe Q3 too. Q4 not so much."
Florida just allowed Elective procedures to go forward as of Monday May 4. Bed utilization is way down and there is a pretty good backlog of patients waiting for surgeries.
"Why are hospital stocks up with Democratic win? Won't they regulate hospitals more, and limit their profits?"
