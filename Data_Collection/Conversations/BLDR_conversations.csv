Materials home builders look good I have traded over last couple years always done well. I don’t understand analyst price targets. Low volume stocks can always surprise. 21 to 23.39. I also have a core position avg under 18
"Oh yeah, now we;re at the lows 4 the year, these institutions are taking us down to 15 ..how sweet! IMHO"
would be nice to see some more chatter in here. Great company with lots of potential upside. Huge demand for this sector.
Nice to see great earnings this morning! Maybe now we can break the $50 resistance level now.
I went the calls route a few months ago. UP...about 170%. Jan. 22 expiration. Thinking of further out calls to keep invested after Jan. 22. Thoughts? Hoping for some chatter also.
I am a new owner & very happy so far. +20%+ in a few days! Any long term holders with comments?Bought because of an article about HUGE pent up housing demand with extremely low interest rates. Should BOOM when this Chinavirus ends.
Fantastic to see the share buyback announcement! This should get this stock price up to where it belongs.
chirp . . . chirp . . .
GONE GREEN O YES 22 coming by end of week my PT is 30 bucks
Is today the day we hit 60?

Seven analysts have made estimates for Builders FirstSource’s earnings. The lowest EPS estimate is $0.41 and the highest is $0.53. Builders FirstSource posted earnings of $0.54 per share in the same quarter last year, which suggests a negative year over year growth rate of 11.1%. The firm is expected to announce its next earnings results on Tuesday, August 6th.According to Zacks, analysts expect that Builders FirstSource will report full-year earnings of $1.62 per share for the current fiscal year, with EPS estimates ranging from $1.41 to $1.75. For the next financial year, analysts anticipate that the company will report earnings of $1.74 per share, with EPS estimates ranging from $1.62 to $1.90. Zacks Investment Research’s EPS calculations are a mean average based on a survey of sell-side research analysts that that provide coverage for Builders FirstSource."
So after 6 months of straight up price action we get an upgrade to strong buy from Zacks? Where were they when the stock was trading in the $12 range? Funny how completely out of synch all these analysts are.
Going synthetically long....selling JAN-22 puts right here---45 strike 30 contracts at 1.65 = $4950 boo-yah
What do you think the earnings will be? Why are price targets in the $20s?

"Largest supplier of new housing supplies in the country -- in key housing growth markets -- pre=built windows, doors, staircases. Also work with local contractors to supply sections of walls and roofing from local factories -- giving quick delivery, reliable skeds, etc., allows workers to connect sections rather than nailing each board in place. Forward need for new housing is great due to underbuilding of new housing for nearly a decade. Profit growth accelerating, can adjust pricing to costs for supplies. Manufacturing arm bought major distributors years back and raised margins. Lumber shortage will bring new innovation"
Don't really understand such negative pressure today. Fundamentally a strong and growing business considering mergers and the state of the housing market ATM.
