Chart looks good and still room to break out further as the 3 day exponential moving average is above the 8 day and 21 day EMA.Demand still looks strong between new unit growth and repair from hurricane season and California fire season. Nice open ramp.

BLDR is down 6.15% to $12.06
I am a new owner & very happy so far. +20%+ in a few days! Any long term holders with comments?Bought because of an article about HUGE pent up housing demand with extremely low interest rates. Should BOOM when this Chinavirus ends.
New 52 week high!!
Undervalued
"bull, what informtion is this stock getting downgrade by the ""analyst""..i ask ya..we beat estimates....anybody interested..?"
"Interesting how valuation of BLDR is at about 0.3x Revs, HDS at 0.9x Revs. No respect for BLDR..."
Builders FirstSource is up 7.79% to 32.66
bldr will crush on their next earnings. I am in the construction industry and seeing the prices of the materials is just unbelievable to me. the producers are killing it..bldr is one of them. P.S we've paid $60 for a sheet of osb recently! nuts! it's normally in the 15 to 20 range
BLDR reached a 52 Week high at 26.34
Moving up
"So i guess thisc\ was a result of housing declines, eh....well , don't think it is warented, just a reason 4 trading...trading down....we'll see.gud luk"
"Yes big earnings, and it gets better. Management says the gross margin is temporarily depressed and will improve later this year. $35 million per year of interest expense savings going forward. Operating expense savings also coming. They are probably already close to a $2.00 EPS run rate and I believe they said $3.00 to $3.50 is the goal. Should be at least a $25 stock."
all goes to the short sellers.....yup.....still think 16 is an awully good price..but then this is the market..right..?
High prices at Home Depot and Lowe's will help this rocket ship. Spring coming. Housing shortage in lots of the country. Builders getting ready to crank up.
"Christ,they post a few insider sells and the stock tumbles .sell, those MM's need share own here...,low volume 2..!"
Builders FirstSource is up 6.46% to 20.19
Should be a good buying opportunity!!!
First post here. I've owned BuildersFC for a couple months. I see Zacks wrote about the valuation. I was wondering when the market woke up to the PE here. I think the company gets bought out within the next 3 years. I'll be adding incrementally.
Going synthetically long....selling JAN-22 puts right here---45 strike 30 contracts at 1.65 = $4950 boo-yah
When will earnings report be released?
"well, now they're taking it down to shake out those nervous ""investors""..such is the marke!t"
When are they merging?
This price action is sad... very strange if we are not able to hold 16 today...company has a good story but you couldn't tell by the price action and the charts.
Builders FirstSource reached an all time high at 40.34
Been watching and finally bought some Main reason ad I saw on TV. Plus hurricane BLDR has many stores in this part of FL. Last CC was good and traded down === great buy also HDS is a winner I THINK with URBN and YES MU. GB
I can't imagine getting any positive outlook as most of the country has been too cold or wet to build.
"What gives? Building is booming, materials in demand, why is this materials supplier dropping?"
BLDR reached a new 52 Week Low at $13.66
"MM I guess ya can't complain..when the Co sells 50,000 shares, followed by other ""insiders""...and no news,of course,..the MMs will be picking up shares ..always happens..wonder when we'll pick up..==that ceo said that things were looking good...., debt wise asl well as business..just don' get it......probably going down into earnings..w/w no darn news,,save those insider sales!!"

Bought some more on the dip this morning. Lots of renovations going on.
This is a vary good mid-cap company. It should be able to come back strong after shaking out weak hands.
here we go again..low volume..think they r shorting it yo get cheaper sharesi..remember this stock's price is so damn volatile..earnings wil tell the story..gud luk
"Largest supplier of new housing supplies in the country -- in key housing growth markets -- pre=built windows, doors, staircases. Also work with local contractors to supply sections of walls and roofing from local factories -- giving quick delivery, reliable skeds, etc., allows workers to connect sections rather than nailing each board in place. Forward need for new housing is great due to underbuilding of new housing for nearly a decade. Profit growth accelerating, can adjust pricing to costs for supplies. Manufacturing arm bought major distributors years back and raised margins. Lumber shortage will bring new innovation"
"Yeah,""distribution""....that's why we're down..institutions shorting it down..ain't that great...not!....."

Don't really understand such negative pressure today. Fundamentally a strong and growing business considering mergers and the state of the housing market ATM.

"FEB 28th look at that CASH FLOW if you don't know CASH FLOW means a lot ,more then most people think. Look at other stocks with cash flow growth like BLDR. Hard to find cash flow growth like that. I know IBM has more cash flow but the growth is what WS cares about and BLDR has it. VGM value growth momentum smart lady told me about BLDR which I've never heard of in 15yrs of playing the stock market. There are investment and then there are trades BLDR is a investment well for the next 2 yrs anyway. Because when the facts change your opinion must change. AMEN but the facts of Builders First Source look great. I will listen to a few CC first before I buy but think we have a winner, JIM taught me well O YES."
Builders FirstSource is down 5.03% to 23.24

So after 6 months of straight up price action we get an upgrade to strong buy from Zacks? Where were they when the stock was trading in the $12 range? Funny how completely out of synch all these analysts are.
Light volume on earnings day.....???/?//
Huge buying opportunity!!!

I don't understand why the BETA is over 3 I like the BETA to be under 1. They said on CC that housing was strong well the housing market doesn't agree TOL. I guess that is WS but love the low pe and TRUST management and turning a nice profit. I thought they did more remolding houses then selling lumber to home builders. Guess I was wrong that has never happen before !
