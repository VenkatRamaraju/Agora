Brought this position up to 100 shares today. Looking for 20%-30% by next blowout earnings.
Does anyone here actually have any TROW funds ? I have a pension buyout coming & have 13yrs till I hit 65. wondering what are the good TROW funds.

"The following quotes are from a Bloomberg story, ""T. Rowe Price Flows Hit as Investors Flee Toward Index Funds"" (search key words, if you'd like to read the entire piece):""T. Rowe Price Group Inc. clients withdrew a net $5.3 billion from its funds in the third quarter as the firm once again saw investors choose index-tracking products over its own offerings.The Baltimore -based asset manager, which oversees about #1.3 trillion, has been a rare bright spot for active management in an industry where passive investing increasingly challenges stock pickers. But despite its success--including a net 14.7 billion of inflows in the second quarter--the firm is feeling the competitive pressure.Assets in actively managed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds amounted to 57.8% of the $20.9 trillion reported to Bloomberg by U.S. fund managers for September. Passive investment funds held 42.2%, a share that has been increasing over time."""
I sure like these All time high's that yahoo is posting.
"Not a shareholder. However I have owned several funds for years.I would appreciate the shareholders telling management to stick to their fiduciary responsibilities and stay out of politics.Amend your bylaws to preclude any employee, including officers, from opining on political issues in any official capacity. Kind of like the military. You can be political out of uniform and on your own time and you should not speak for the company.Never though TRP would go woke."
Great company only going higher long term imho. Like the new coming deal which is accreditive to earnings. Great dividend growth plus every 4-5yrs or so you get a special dividend. That recent 3 dollar one made my year.
"Totally meaningless, but it's FUN! when in a single day a holding increases by more than twice its cost.Now had I not sold a majority of my shares over the years, but heck Bill Gates has probably sold relatively more shares of MSFT than I have of TROW.Perhaps my initial statement is not meaningless; it does demonstrate buying and holding for the real long term can work!"

"Once in a while I listen to Ric Edelman on Sundays (if I'm in my car; never at home).Yesterday there was a fill in host and she remarked that Ric is a big fan of ETFs and that he believes in twenty years mutual funds will no longer exist! Sure, twenty years is a long time, but I've been long TROW a longer number of years! The situation is fluid and TROW should evolve."
Will be adding soon. I understand that they lowered some fees a few basis points. However a basis point is ONLY one hundredth of a percent and with added funds imho will pick up new clients. Zero long term debt low payout and peg ratio makes this imo a buy>
Back in full at $214...
"Love, love, love this company. Unbelievable performance past year. Thanks to all for the great work TROW!"
Added at $189.20
Fidelity has $0 commission fee. Should TROW offers $0 commission also????
Will never sell. Great run company that pays a nice healthy dividend.
buying here just raised their dividend over 18% and no lt debt.
"Another nice Q.It's meaningless, but fun when a stock I'm long increases more than my per share basis in just one day. Dividend increase should be announced on or around 2/12. Est. (from a Bloomberg) 0.84, or a 10.5% increase from 0.76. Speaking of dividends, when will TROW pay another special dividend?"

What is going on with this huge drop? Does anyone know?
"""It's the most wonderful time of the year""For dividend increases, that is!Any day, TROW will once again increase its dividend..57 to .69 per Q? That is the forecast on a Bloomberg terminal."
I'd hate to be short today lol
Market volatility: when a position decreases by over a factor of three times basis one day and increases 3.75 times my basis the next day....Are we all having fun?
IN TROW I TRUST

"CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF T. ROWE PRICE GROUP, INC.But...raised the price target to 220, up 13"
Sweet! 20% dividend hike!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-group-declares-164300975.html
How does this company with its immaculate balance sheet and solid dividend go so unnoticed? Itâ€™s a smaller version of Blackrock.
T. Rowe Price reached an all time high at 144.00
Buy the dip? What do you think?
They own a huge chunk of rivian. Do you think it will have a positive impact in the next few months?
So solid!!https://seekingalpha.com/news/3721355-t-rowe-price-eps-beats-by-011-beats-on-revenue
"In this case, I'm happy to be wrong as there was ""room"" for a special dividend even though TROW recently announced fee reductions. I had been expecting another special div, but after reading about the fee reduction, I didn't think one was in the offing near term.3.00 Ex 6/14 and payable 7/7I like the progression:2.00 Paid 4/23/151.00 Paid 12/28/12After I receive the 7/7 3.00 div, I will have received more in special dividends/share than my basis per share. (Now if only I hadn't sold any shares!....)"
Sweet! I could get used to more DRIP days like today... ;)
