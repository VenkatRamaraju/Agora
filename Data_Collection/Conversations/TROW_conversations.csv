"Earlier this AM, I sold more shares @72.86; about 25% of all TROW shares I held.I'm not nearly as optimistic re TROW as I was when this position was taken in my Roth 11/08.Unfortunately this holding was not a winner given approx. total return for my holding period:TROW 191%S & P 200 222%S&P500 Financial Index 165%Why didn't I sell all shares last Dec, when I sold some on 12/8 @ 78.16??Still holding 1/4 of my original buy made 7/95 in my taxable AC.See what tomorrow's earnings bring...I'm not optimistic."
MARKET WILL CRASH
Why the big jump after hours???
"Another nice Q.It's meaningless, but fun when a stock I'm long increases more than my per share basis in just one day. Dividend increase should be announced on or around 2/12. Est. (from a Bloomberg) 0.84, or a 10.5% increase from 0.76. Speaking of dividends, when will TROW pay another special dividend?"

"Disappointed with today's results, more reinvestment into infrastructure, business model looks like their portfolios are mediocre and renvue was struggle. TROW can do better, they need to get to the progressive benchmark rather sooner than later. Hopefully the stock responds positive and at least back to $75."
My position is down more than my per share basis!!Lowering expenses and launching a marketing campaign...I don't see another special dividend in our future for some time! Last special dividends were paid 12/12 & 4/15.Cheers.

"Not a shareholder. However I have owned several funds for years.I would appreciate the shareholders telling management to stick to their fiduciary responsibilities and stay out of politics.Amend your bylaws to preclude any employee, including officers, from opining on political issues in any official capacity. Kind of like the military. You can be political out of uniform and on your own time and you should not speak for the company.Never though TRP would go woke."
"""It's the most wonderful time of the year""For dividend increases, that is!Any day, TROW will once again increase its dividend..57 to .69 per Q? That is the forecast on a Bloomberg terminal."

TROW AUM up 5.4% during May.VTI (my proxy for the market) was also up 5.4% for the month of May. Interpret as you may!TROW was up 4.76%
How does this company with its immaculate balance sheet and solid dividend go so unnoticed? It’s a smaller version of Blackrock.

The scenarios are quite interesting at current levels for TROW. google awesomeSTO-CKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
"The following quotes are from a Bloomberg story, ""T. Rowe Price Flows Hit as Investors Flee Toward Index Funds"" (search key words, if you'd like to read the entire piece):""T. Rowe Price Group Inc. clients withdrew a net $5.3 billion from its funds in the third quarter as the firm once again saw investors choose index-tracking products over its own offerings.The Baltimore -based asset manager, which oversees about #1.3 trillion, has been a rare bright spot for active management in an industry where passive investing increasingly challenges stock pickers. But despite its success--including a net 14.7 billion of inflows in the second quarter--the firm is feeling the competitive pressure.Assets in actively managed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds amounted to 57.8% of the $20.9 trillion reported to Bloomberg by U.S. fund managers for September. Passive investment funds held 42.2%, a share that has been increasing over time."""

Sweet! I could get used to more DRIP days like today... ;)
Sold out of trow at 205 thinking I could buy back in lower. Add it to my list of companies I should’ve held. Some companies just very rarely trade at fair value
"Thanks, Yahoo F. Earlier today I cut and pasted a paragraph from an article on Yahoo F's homepage, and like some of my other posts, it has disappeared.

Will be adding soon. I understand that they lowered some fees a few basis points. However a basis point is ONLY one hundredth of a percent and with added funds imho will pick up new clients. Zero long term debt low payout and peg ratio makes this imo a buy>

Will this stock ever move up? Its been dead for a year. You would have thought the divi increase would have helped.
what are dividend payment dates for 2019?
This company has a nice stake in Rivian and I think that can really serve them well.
"In this case, I'm happy to be wrong as there was ""room"" for a special dividend even though TROW recently announced fee reductions.
