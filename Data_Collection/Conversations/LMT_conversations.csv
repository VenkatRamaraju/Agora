"surprising support from MS and CFRA today issuing an Overweight and Buy respectively.basically, the value and $6B buyback overshadow short term guidance issues."
"""LMT, the company that makes warheads!!!"" Yeah but how can they make warheads if a good percentage of their supply chain is abroad? How much of the critical path is dependent on China? How much of the critical path dependent on Taiwan? What percentage of product inputs are sourced from the US. LMT illustrates a total failure of US public policy that took place over decades."
Selling this morning premarket is way overdone. Buy with this opportunity and hold for the long term. Nice dividend also!
Am I looking at this right? There’s 275M outstanding shares and we’ve lost $45 dollars a share so that’s $12B in value that was lost by investors. And our leader is still getting paid?
"Third quarter 2021 net earnings include a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company, and unrealized gains of $98 million ($74 million, or $0.27 per share, after-tax) due to increases in the fair value of investments held in the Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. This caused the drop? LOL"
And now an investor class action suit. The legal sharks are circling.
Management unleash 50% of that buyback money and stabilize the price
So typical for traders to want to retest recent Lows before heading higher. Don’t let manipulators steal your shares at this level. Should be back into the $350 range in a very short period of time and back to 52 week high by year end. ￼￼￼
"""Lockheed said the drop in sales was partially offset by its hypersonic weapons development. The company has six hypersonic weapons programs and CEO Jim Taiclet told analysts that he ""multiple"" programs starting production between 2023 and 2026. The company is developing hypersonic weapons and opened a new factory in Alabama for hypersonic missile production earlier this month. Unlike ballistic missiles, which fly in a predictable arc, hypersonic weapons fly five times the speed of sound — or Mach 5 — in unpredictable flight paths, making them difficult to defend against."" Let's not forget that though the F-35 isn't cheap, everyone wants it and it will remain in high demand for years to come."
Am I the only one who felt like the LMT team wasn't totally prepared for the earnings call.
"JPM from $435 to $395GS from $420 to $381USB from $425 to $375WfC from $385 to $340Baird from $394 to 375Bernstein from $424 to 387These are the target reductions so far this week. Main issue for analyst is the lack of earnings growth for the next 2-3 years. Personally, I think we test $325 first. Good chance of a test of $319. Then, I am not sure."
Just increased my December $335 call options. Expecting easy triple in a week or two!
Will be back around 350$ in no time
">>$1.7 billion noncash pension settlement charge, <<the CEO is cooking the book."
Definitely prefer $LHX vs. $LMT!
Key word: Hypersonic!Key word: Buy!
"If the numbers here at Yahoo financial are accurate, LMT pays out a 3% dividend at a P/E of 14. You cannot keep your money in cash or bonds or CD’s so why not consider holding LMT as your brokerage cash account position, a defensive play. Ok, well this is my plan and I’m sticking to it. Long holding investor"
Has this stock ever moved this much in a single day? lol
Supply chain issues. That will correct not in the short term but in the long term. Buy and hold for the long term.
I love discounts and panic sellers. Backing up the truck at $332.
"Hey I was on the LMT earnings conference call, and the CEO Jim T was extremely excited about the $0.20 dividend increase. Wow 20 cents vs a $44 dollar decline in share price...real shareholder value???"
Major oversell with P/E around 14.5 to 15 supported by 3.4% dividends.
"At some point this market becomes comedy…. A company as important as LMT losses 11% of it value overnight. We are not talking about a software company here, we are talking about LMT, the company that makes warheads!!! Everything about this market is a joke, in fact the entire country is a joke! I am down heavy on this but I’ll continue to buy"
only notification I have from Yahoo is that LMT surpassed its EPS. someone wanna fill me in on what's going on here?
In for another 25 @337. This company is not going bankrupt.
"My dear nieces, say goodbye to your holiday gifts ..."
it is hard to see your holdings go down 11%-12%. Then again when you cost basis is less than 70 and you have gotten all those dividends all these years you got to be a little philosophical about it.
If you liked it at $375 you’ll LOVE IT at $340 early XMAS just bought another 100 shares
Grossly oversold!
"somebody check my math. LMT announced a $6B buyback. If they buyback 10% of the average daily volume every day, that is $42.9M worth of stock each day at a price of $330. It will take 28 weeks of buying everyday to get through that buyback.Are companies allowed to set Buy Limit orders? they could just set a constant buy at 330$ and basically set a floor to the price.ending up buying 18M shares and reducing the total share count by 7%. which reduces the amount of cash spent on future div.I am not happy about the guidance but the actual value and price still matter, but value investing is likely dead until sanity has a place at the market. You will know when this happens, when the joke cryptos crash."
"Almost a $50 haircut for a slight miss lolThe company is now expecting adj. EPS of $27.17, compared with prior guidance of $26.70 to $27.00. It expects sales of $67.0 billion compared with prior guidance of $67.3 billion.Not that bad to justify this kind of loss. Turn the machines back on Mortimore lol"
"got in for a few shares at $342 with a limit purchase I had from a while back that hit. Sure, I'm down - but thinking this is long term hold - not a day trade special..."
Got to start questioning whether Jim Taiclet is a good fit for heading the company. He did well at American Tower. But using the strategy of a telecom company at LMT probably not going to work.
Down $18 pre market. Sales miss for the quarter. Guidance lowers sales for 2021 and 2022. EPS beat.
"I admit, I am no chart expert, but a cup and handle pattern appears to be forming. Look at the 6 month chart. Defense spending will only continue to rise as global political tensions increase and no matter who is in the Whitehouse."
Hypersonics are coming - both offensive and interceptors. If we know the threat is there - this is the worst reaction to earnings I’ve seen. The CEO needs to be confident that he has the answer. Every news release mentions their hypersonic missile segment - but where is the positive reaction? Congress knows what it must do in these upcoming budget and hearing committee meetings. China just tested their orbital hypersonic. It was all over the news. All I can say is this is way too much of an overreaction.
What a beautiful dividend stock
"Lol, another buying opportunity coming up. Market reacts like it’s going bankrupt. Supoky chain issues affects everyone. EPS higher than expected, but Wall Street doesn’t care about eps any more."
supply chain issues are temporary and will ease next year sometime. defense spending should remain strong given US fears of falling behind China and Taiwan dispute. so i wouldn't be afraid if i were holding the stock right now ..
"Absolutely, it will only take 4 years of dividends to recover what was lost today...patience is a virtue."
