As 50/50 investor in LITE & IIVI I know its a good time to buy shares in the looser company. This bidding war is getting out of hand. Both companies well run and management knows what they’re doing. The war is about future markets and technology.So the question who has better backing Bain or Silver Lake will decide who will be number one. I still think the “looser “ company is a good Buy at this point 
Is it legal for companies to share material information privately with Wall Street firms and then for those analysts to share that information with Dan Niles? There are disclosure rules and also inside trading rules.

Lumentum Holdings Price Target Raised to $120.00/Share From $115.00 by Needham
"LITE shareholders can take some comfort in GLW's full-year guidance released this morning. The press release says, ""Optical Communications is now expected to grow by a high-teens percentage for the year versus prior guidance of 10%."""
"Ranjit Thomas……take note of this contrary viewpoint and lighten up on Lite…The GAAP operational deterioration is of course the result of the $1.8B Oclaro (OCLR) acquisition…This GAAP deterioration will correct (and one has to keep in mind that the graph depicts 12-month periods, the latest quarter is already better).Indeed, for fiscal 2019 non-GAAP gross margin rose 60bp to 39.5% due to leverage and mix (3D sensing and commercial lasers enjoy higher margins) and non-GAAP operating margins increased 80bp to 20.5%. There is considerable operational leverage (Q4CC):synergies achieved to-date through the fourth quarter helped drive a sequential 120 basis points expansion in operating margin despite a 7% sequential decline in revenue.The good news is that management has identified an additional $40M a year in these synergies from the Oclaro acquisition, taking the total to $100M. While these additional $40M will start to realize from Q1 onwards, the bulk of these will come in 4-5 quarters.Given the recent wave of M&A activity in the sector, we think these fundamentals could improve, especially if/when the headwinds from the trade troubles start to calm.One could also argue that were in the beginning of a major upturn with 5G, to which Lumentum can add the 3D sensing boom which is set to continue and spread to other industries besides mobile. So we don't see any valuation concerns at this moment.ConclusionWe still think there is mileage in the shares of Lumentum. The shares are certainly not excessively valued and the company is benefiting from some secular tailwinds like the increasing demand for ROADMs and VCSELs and the coming 5G build out."
"As a new investor here (I am a OCLR investor - yea painful ride there), have a few basic questions/observations regarding LITE.1) Not much uncertainty left on OCLR acquisition.2) There might be some uncertainty about OCLR's business - pending ZTE getting the nod to go ahead with the regular business from US commerce dept.3) Good chance that ZTE gets the nod.4) OCLR shareholders WILL approve the merger.5) LITE/OCLR very powerful combo in optos6) OCLR accretive to LITE profits7) LITE's main business doing well - unless AAPL sneezes.So barring less probable uncertainties (#2 and #7 above), what is holding LITE?Am I missing anything obvious?If I am not missing anything then OCLR is a buy just for the arbitrage of at least $1 and then buy LITE (on top of the shares you will be getting via OCLR) going to $100+ by this time next year. Thank you."
"anyone who has the time (I'm sick that's why I do on a Saturday afternoon ) I suggest listening to the earnings conference call website replay. Found on investor section of their website. Great stuff! On two occasions tailwinds for the rest of 2020 were mentioned. 2nd half ramp in 3d sensors, capacity on a number of their products that we're currently building out inventory for, continued synergies from the Oclaro acquisition that translate into stronger margins and more. Continued Huawei struggles (mostly US government induced) slower ramp in Android acceptance with 3d, some of that for the same prior reason and now the corona virus which has been accounted for in the quarterly numbers. If the virus continues it will affect future numbers. I heard lots of potential 50% increases over the next year on various segments of the business. As the business becomes more visible I believe we will see PE expansion and growth in the teens and higher. $6, $8 even 10/share earning is coming."
"Well we're at the mid 80s I thought would happen b4 earnings. Now what? So we didn't warn, that great!!! Do we have a good enough beat to keep momentum going? Guide higher/lower? Tough place. I trimmed shares I bought in the low to mid 70s. During this recent drop. Still hold a substantial core position."
"The way the price for Coherent has escalated, I must say that I am less ebullient now about this acquisition than I was when Lumentum first announced its initial $5.6 billion deal with Coherent.II-VI’s offer now stands at £6.8 Billion and the bun fight may not be over. The situation for II-VI is even more precarious in that they already carried debt whereas, the Coherent+Lumentum combination had c. $1billion in cash on their books. In regard to II-VI, as I read it….for Bain Capital’s injection of $1.5 Billion, Bain get $1.5 billion dollars worth of new equity in II-VI. That’s new shares that II-VI will need to issue on top of the dilution coming from the one-for-one merger offer. Nobody has questioned what price Bain will be paying per share, but you can guarantee they will be getting them at a healthy discount. At least 10% but more probably 20%. Taking the midpoint and II-VI’s current sp of $71.50, that equates to a price for Bain of c. $60.78 per share. Meaning, Bain Capital will be issued with nearly 25 million shares and will attain approximately 24% control of the combined entity. Coherent has c. 24.45 million shares in issue, so the 1 for 1 swap in the II-VI offer equates to a further 24.45 million shares to be issued. Total, c. 50 million new shares. The number of shares currently in issue for II-VI is c.105 million. Therefore, II-VI’s current offer for Coherent means that existing shareholders are going to be diluted by a staggering c.50%. How damaging is that? It would be remiss not to highlight also that II-VI will be paying the $218 million break fee on top of the $6.8 Billion they are now offering for Coherent.As this bun fight continues and the buy-out price escalates, is it not surprising that those II-VI shareholders who have the nous to work this out, are bailing in advance of the consequences of this reality? That said, the enforced pressure on Lumentum to out-bid II-VI has consequences for Lumentum and its shareholders and it is leaving me very anxious, to say the least. I wanted this marriage but not at any price. In fact, not even at the next bid price. Unfortunately, since Lumentum's sp has continued to rise since their last offer, they may only need to tweak the cash element of it, in order to have another go. I suspect they will. We should know by Tuesday."
I got out of LITE months ago around $60 and have been keeping an eye on it since. Now the share price has dropped to point that I am back in.
mkm partners raised PT to street high 91 this morning while Needham lowered us to a buy from strong buy.

"News is that the II-VI offer is superior to Lumentiums. My guess is that Lumentum will now be given some days to respond. Whither it decides to raise its offer or not, we will just have to wait and see.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3670157-coherent-says-ii-vis-raised-acquisition-offer-is-superior-to-lumentum-bid?mail_subject=lite-coherent-says-ii-vi-s-raised-acquisition-offer-is-superior-to-lumentum-bid&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha"
"Huge growth everywhere but Data Center and OCLR will more than make up for that. See below. $7-$9 EPS after acquisition.Turning to segment and product line details. Our Optical Communications segment revenue at $310.1 million increased 27% sequentially and was up 49% relative to the same period in the prior year. Within our Optical Communications segment, Telecom revenue at $142.9 million was up 7% sequentially and 29% year-on-year. As Alan highlighted, transport products, including ROADMs, were significant contributors to the Telecom group. Datacom revenue at $34.2 million was down 1% sequentially, but down 24% year-on-year. Industrial and Consumer revenue at $133 million was up 72% sequentially and up 154% relative to the same period the prior year due to 3D sensing expansion into more customers, models and device types."
"I posted this two weeks ago...We already know that the stock price has little to do with the actual numbers and guidance for the last couple of years. We're also in a market that hasn't acted ""right"". So it's nothing more than a coin flip as to what LITE's price action will be. If they beat and guide higher that's still no guarantee of anything. I've had this happen to me many times with LITE. Great earnings and guidance and then some negative analyst comment about IPhone forecasts, or China trade deals, or IIVI ramping up production in Texas."
My guess is that OCLR merger is imminent

"How does the Point & Figure chart look? After earnings last week we ran to $89. Then we had a slight pullback and reversed back into column of Os. It was only a 3 box reversal though (the smallest possible reversal). By trading above $90 today we put in a higher high off that $89 level. So we're in an ""ascending triple top breakout."""
"Lumentum Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: LITE) made a good decision to shelve its plans to acquire Coherent Inc (NASDAQ: COHR), as the bidding war had taken the company to an elevated valuation, according to Raymond James. “We suspect the iPhone 13 will feature a new module that could present an opportunity for Lumentum to retake share. Further, the ramp of Android phones adds a growth dimension,” Leopold said. “With the deal risk behind us, and upside led by 3D sensing, telecom, LiDAR and 5G, we see an attractive entry point.”"

Consequently, ams expects 2018 to be another year of strong growth and record revenues for ams. The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to increase further sequentially to 16-20%, taking into account product mix effects as overall demand is skewed to a mix including certain higher maturity products.ams has decided to de-emphasize current efforts in environmental sensing and focus strongly on very attractive mid- and long-term growth opportunities in optical technologies.3D sensing peers lower: LITE -5%, IIVI -1.6%, FNSR -1.3%"

It’s getting close to that timeline so possibly a trade deal finalised (bar the signing) this weekend or soon after.If this trade deal gets announced with some rollback in tariffs along with the Huawei licences being issued (which we were promised would be soon) then Lumentum will likely shoot through $70.Extract…REUTERS.

I'm back in. I have been riding NVDA for the last few months. Today was the day to start a new position with LITE for the 4th time. Ha the 4th time is always the charm.
"LITE is cheap when looking at free cash flow yield. Free cash flow yield is north of 6 percent. I firmly believe the mid 100s are closer to fair value, not the current price, Free cash flow has tripled over the last few years, and is currently the highest it's ever been. LITE's cash doubled over the last year, but that may be due to the COHR acquisition, I'm not sure. Either way they have a generous supply of cash in the balance sheet. Bottom line, take advantage of the recent pull back from the 100s, long term this stock will go back there."
so there won't be a pre earnings announcement. So now hoping for a slight beat and higher guidance to justify this move and push us even higher. that will cause momentum buyers and analysts to adjust their PTs higher.
Tme for them to start looking for a buyer.

"I posted the following 6 weeks ago. It has nothing to do with P&F charts. Here are a few questions for anyone on the message board.-Why did LITE, IIVI and MKSI move in lockstep and all have a stellar day on Friday?-When an analyst like Simon Leopold ""pounds the table"" does that give the all clear sign?-How will LITE trade into the upcoming earnings report with those less than stellar guidance figures?-What do you think guidance will be for the following quarter?-Now that COHR is in a key competitor's hands instead of LITE's what does that do to the short, mid and long term prospects for LITE?Are you better off buying IIVI stock instead of LITE since they got COHR?-Has IIVI been cutting into LITE's share due to the Sherman Texas plant being up and running and certified for the past 12 months? By how much?-Is the overall market exuberance we've been seeing going to continue? What happens to LITE when the overall market corrects? Has the correction already started?-What's the status of supply chain issues?-What's going on with Huawei?Now I'm back to current commentary.

Hello everyone. Been trading LITE very successfully for the last 5 months or so. Basically writing puts buying shares cheap then selling calls then selling stock etc. Anyway trying to get a better handle on effect China issues will have on LITE. Any input appreciated. I'd like take a long term permanent position on LITE if it gets hit again ver China but trying to grasp if it's going down with market or China stuff has a real effect on LITE. Thanks
Here are a few ideas not related to point & figure charts that I think we can all agree on:1) Analysts have very little credibility2) Much of the movement of an individual stock price is driven by the movement of the overall market and the sector3) It helps to think more market neutral than fall in love with a bullish or bearish narrative4) Thinking about ideas like I listed in my previous post helps frame the problem of how you should be positioned in an individual stock. I don't know the answers but I do know the questions I'd be asking management during the conference call.It would be great to get some good discussion going prior to the conference call next week.
"@James I wouldn't worry about the price of OCLR or LITE at the time of closing. For each OCLR share, you're getting a fixed amount of cash ($5.60) plus a fixed fraction of a share of LITE (.0636). That's what you get regardless of the price of either stock at a particular time. Of course, we longs do want LITE to go higher now that we own it!"
"My update on the P&F chart follows. Tuesday we broke through the bullish support line in a very convincing manner to the downside. The stock price went to 86. We reversed back up when it traded at 90. That's what usually happens. You get a bounce. Two questions that will be answered as the chart develops over the next few days: 1) Will LITE continue to move higher (and by how much) before the strong possibility of going back to test the 86 level?2) How will it react to the 86 level if it goes back to retest?The overall ""exuberance"" of the market in general is quite important to take into consideration as well.The non chart issue that should also be on our radar is the COHR earnings report."

The brokerage presently has a “buy” rating on the technology company’s stock. Needham & Company LLC’s price target indicates a potential upside of 42.25% from the company’s current price."
"IIVI GETS lite to overpay so much for this acquisition, it will be an anchor sinking the operation financially. Glad IIVI has seen the light, so the stock will go back to three digit briefly reached before bidding for COHR. Good management is reflected in knowing when to bit and when to stop."
"What does the chart look like after today's action? Actually the same as yesterday. We stayed above $41, so we're right at the bullish support line. Most likely, the bullish support line coincides with whatever technical methods you're using to track such things (i.e. Bollinger bands). For those of you not used to looking at these, let me explain. Last September we're at $69. Ever since then LITE has been in a downtrend. Actually, if you take a little broader view, LITE has been in a downtrend since March 2018. So that downtrend has a series of lower tops. If you draw a line connecting those lower tops, that's teh bearish resistance line. Along the way, we've also had some upward moves. The low of $37 back in Nov/Dec and the gyrating we've been doing ever since has formed a pattern of higher lows. Draw a line connecting those lows and you have the bullish support line. So the game now is to stay above the bullish support line. If it breaks, then we likely test the $37 level and put in a double bottom. Any questions please let me know. And please post your technical thoughts to confirm or call mine into question. I don't care if I'm right on a chart as much as I want to learn from other posters to make better trading decisions."

"Worth reiterating Goldman Sachs outlook for Lumentum shares. 06/07/19. Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Harr reiterated a Buy rating and $69.00 price target on Lumentum after assessing a worst case earnings scenario that assumes 100% of Huawei rerated revenues are lost and Apple’s iPhone volumes end up being 20% lower than his below consensus estimates. The analyst stated ""This downside scenario implies Lumentum would likely deliver about $3.27 in FY (to June) EPS which implies a current forward trading PE of 13.2x vs. a recent historical median PE of 12'3x. ""While acknowledging that a range of outcomes may exist outside our analysis, we highlight that even in our most bearish scenario, the implied PE multiple is 13x at current trading levels. This compares to Lumentum's median multiple of 16x since it started trading in 2015 and 12.3x since 2018. We also flag again that we see our most bearish scenario as unlikely, given at least some ROADM revenue is replaceable and iPhone unit weakness is already built into our model. ln our note published on May 20 we estimated that 34% of Huawei revenue is replaceable in our central case""."

I used to like trading in LITE. Not any more. The market action is weak. I'm afraid of a repeat of what happened after last earnings report. We may see a tanking into the 60's.
"The latest broker upgrades I have are as follows.... (conformation welcome). B. Riley restated a “buy” rating and issued a $71.00 price target (up previously from $68.00) on shares of Lumentum in a research note on Friday. Craig Hallum restated a “buy” rating and issued a $75.00 price target (up previously from $60.00) on shares of Lumentum in a research report on Friday. Jun Zhang, Rosenblatt Securities, reiterated a ‘buy’ with a sp target of $80 yesterday on shares of Lumentum."
Rather to stay at the mercy of the unknown. Lumentum should publicly withdraw its bid. They will not win a bidding war and they are certainly a successful company without the acquisition. Losing a bidding war is a negative so get past that issue as soon as possible.

"Just read their August earnings transcript here: My takeaways are the company is the leader in their various markets, especially 3D sensing where they are by far the largest vendor with the highest quality and the ONLY company able to scale with no quality issues. They are growing strongly in 5G and data center and currently have a $150M backlog which will take at least 3 quarters to meet because new orders keep coming in. Margins are improving and with the new Iphone coming soon with world-facing 3D sensing camera, both sales/margins should remain strong going forward. Company has net cash position with no debt due in the next few years, which gives them flexibility.Unlike competitors, they are having to add capacity to keep up with strong demand. They have been investing heavily in R&D, which will allow them to release great new tech and expect to maintain the lead in their data/vcsel chips for foreseeable future. Even with the COVID-related headwinds and Huawei ban, their sales/eps/margins are still growing nicely."
Do nothing management is the problem... When will we see $120 per share???
"For you Point & Figure fans it's been the usual roller coaster ride. A few weeks ago LITE put in the KEY chart signal which was a higher high above the bearish resistance line by trading above $59. Then, of course, it gets taken down to below $52, but above $51. The key to that huge pullback is that LITE put in a higher low. So now we see how it trades once the heavy volume trading starts when the market opens. Trades above $60 would establish another higher high off the last pullback from the $59 level of a few weeks ago. And better yet these higher highs are above the bearish resistance line.So use whatever charting method you like and see what the pattern is telling you. Then share those comments with the board. I always like to hear other interpretations."
Unless you believe that Lumentum was talking fantasy on the CC then theCC was fantastic. Huawei down below 10% of sales. I don't know how that is even possible but they said it would be even less next quarter. They are really pumping the upcoming android business.
"The cheerleaders continue to say how my P&F charting methods (over 100 years old by the way) and asking questions about LITE's business are ""inappropriate"". If you follow all of my postings for as long back as you want, you'll see that I don't claim to have any magic answers. I just take a more critical thinking approach to managing a long position. So, let's say you're a buy and hold person. Managing a long position might be to take a little off the table and buy some 4 to 6 month puts with those funds when the market gets a little more risky than usual. You certainly don't want to over insure yourself with options, but in the right amount they can be helpful. This is in contrast to watching your hard earned gains evaporate. I ask hard questions and hope to get some dialogue from the other board posters. I have very little to share other than facts. The P&F charts are facts since they show something that's already happened and based on that what's likely to happen next. ""Likely"" does not mean 100%, but it's better than the naive approach.I seem to create a lot of angst for certain posters. I guess it's hard to move to a more neutral, objective thought process instead of being in love with the bullish or bearish narrative. Let's see many thumbs downs I get for this post!"
"I can already predict many thumbs down ratings from the board cheerleaders, but I have a more neutral attitude toward the short and medium term stock price. I think LITE, IIVI and COHR (now linked to LITE) will go wherever the overall market goes."
"Maintained as Strong Buy at Raymond James . Price target $96, raised from $85."
"For you chartists out there, run a Point & Figure chart and see what just happened when we went through $62.This is coming from an earlier move where we put in a higher high and broke through the bearish resistance line. We've then had this directionless grinding, churning going on over the past several days. Now we have a triple top breakout above the bearish resistance line when we went through $62.What does it mean? The chart just shows what's going on with the supply and demand relationship of the stock."
"06/07/19 Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall reiterated a Buy rating and $69.00 price target on Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) after assessing a worst case earnings scenario that assumes 100% of Huawei related revenues are lost and Apple’s iPhone volumes end up being 20% lower than his below consensus estimates.The analyst stated ""This downside scenario implies Lumentum would likely deliver about $3.27 in FY (to June) EPS which implies a current forward trading PE of 13.2x vs. a recent historical median PEof 12.3x"". ""While acknowledging that a range of outcomes may exist outside our analysis, we highlight that even in our most bearish scenario, the implied PE multiple is ~13x at current trading levels. This compares to Lumentum’s median multiple of ~16x since it started trading in 2015, and 2.3x since 2018. We also flag again that we see our most bearish scenario as unlikely, given at least some ROADM revenue is replaceable and iPhone unit weakness is already built into our model. In our note published on May 20 we estimated ~34% of Huawei revenue is replaceable in our central case""."
@adrienne - thanks for the reminder on the GS conference - just listen to it - among many positives they clearly stated that demand for ROADM is so strong that if Huawei were to be removed from the picture they would replace the demand by “rapidly” moving the demand to other customers
"NEW YORK (Reuters) -MARCH 15, 2019 / 11:16 AM U.S. stocks rose on Friday, led by technology companies, as a report on progress in U.S.-China trade talks lifted sentiment, pushing the S&P 500 to its best week since November. China’s state-run Xinhua news agency said Washington and Beijing were making substantive progress on trade talks, providing relief after news that a summit to seal a deal between the two sides would not happen at March-end. Chipmakers, which tend to derive a large portion of their revenue from China, rose. The Philadelphia SE chip index climbed 2.9 percent while the S&P 500 technology index rose 1.2 percent."
"I’m happy to hold into the next set of results and beyond. All this talk about Apple pulling forward orders is unfounded. More like they increased orders due to exceptionally high demand for their new range of iPhone 11’s. That was a strong report on Apple iPhone sales projections for the 3rd and 4th qtrs of this year and into 2020 and 2021. (see Tim’s post below). Personally I think there is a bit of FUD spreading at work here. https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/30/analysts-raise-forecasts-on-strong-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-salesAlso, people need to listen again to the content of the last conference call."
A 10% drop without any news? I know the market is down but this is overdone. Apparently many short term investors were not impressed with the earnings call. The price went up based on what many believed might be a surprise to the upside. That money has left for better prospects.

"Long term [2022] options are holding up. The road back might be slower than the quick slide down, but once this turns, it will be a steady climb back to the '90s."
"LITE is a very misunderstood stock by The Market. “The Market” in this case is represented by short sellers, and smaller investors that of course take any down move of the stock seriously. There is obviously several short sellers who have been successful earlier in shorting fiber-optic companies, and they seem to think that the sector is ready to collapse on any possible bad news. In the case of LITE, the are very misguided.The fact is that the whole analyst community and institutions that they support know that LITE will stay market leader for the foreseeable future in VCSEL and Edge Emitters for 3D sensing. They also know that the 2nd half of 2018 will represent an enormous growth of 3D sensing. As AAPL, who until now has only used 3DS in Iphone X, will use it in all new Iphone models to be launched in Sept.-Oct. as well as a couple of Ipad pro models, plus that a number of Android models will also use it.The analyst community pretty much agrees that LITE’s market share will stay fairly intact until the end of 2018. It may perhaps fall from 90% in H22017 to 80% in H22018, which translates to sales in the region of 500MUSD only in 3DS for LITE during H22018.This also means that LITE will greatly exceed the consensus forecast in CQ3 and CQ4, 2018.The last down push in LITEs price, that started Friday, was due to that their main substrate supplier for 3DS components, WIN Semiconductors of Taiwan, reduced the Q3 outlook a bit.A number of analysts immediately stepped up to defend LITE. Their main points are listed in this article:https://www.barrons.com/articles/lumentum-finisar-drop-but-3-d-sensings-not-over-1532123484?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahooThe take-away is that none of the 4 commenting analysts changed any of their LITE ratings. Though a couple of them talk about IIVI or FNSR gaining a bit of share, none of them see any major shift in the market, and of course, none believe that H2, 2018 will be a bad quarter for LITE. Even if one of the iPhone model will be delayed to Oct-Nov due to screen issues, and even if total new iPhones are down since last year, we can be sure that (as opposed to only the I-Phone X last year) all newly launched iPhones in themselves mean a huge chunk of business for LITE. Whether that represents 80M or 100M devices, it is anyway way over estimate sales.The explanation of why WIN semiconductors reduced Q3 forecast, is that WIN kept manufacturing a lot of 3DS modules in Q2 (16% of sales = 24MUSD) all of which surely went to LITE, in spite of the main taker of the modules (I-Phone X) slowing. The reason LITE took the deliveries was that they want to be sure the can meet their huge AAPL deliveries for 2018 q3 and q4. This resulted in less business left for WIN during q3. In spite of lowering their forecast, WIN is expected to increase their q3 VCSEL sales 80-90% y/y.I would assume that LITE’s non 3DS business will be at least 250M in each of 3rd and 4th quarter 2018, as their other business is growing, the small exception being CWDM transceivers, where LITE is hanging in, in expectation of keeping market share until the launch of their newly developed low cost modules. Their other main (ROADM, etc) business is growing nicely.This means that LITE revenue should end up around 450MUSD+ during each of the coming quarters, which is a lot over consensus.The excess business is also high margin, meaning the net profit will be very much over forecast during H2 2018, likely around $2 per quarter. LITE will of course hold back parts of this coming good news when they give the FY annual report around August 9th, but they will for sure raise their September quarter forecast a lot over the current $1 estimates.Sorry that this post was so long, but as a final thought, I wonder who in their right mind wants to hold a highly successful, and fast growing company like LITE short, when their forward PE (based on a too low gains figure is just under 12 today, 53.9/4.6). Today 15% or about 500MUSD worth of LITE are held short. Incredible!"
Lumentum Holdings Price Target Announced at $110.00/Share by Loop Capital
The weakness is because the OFC presentation pointed out some negative impacts on revenue over the next few quarters (and today it’s compounded by what may be the start of a market correction):~ $20M/quarter reduction from CIG transaction~ additional reduction as they exit some other data center modules beyond the CIG products~ some additional reduction as they exit some non-indium phosphide telecom productsThey explained that these moves were part of the Oclaro acquisition synergy plan and will improve profitability as these unprofitable product lines are eliminated. They believe the datacom transceiver business has too many suppliers competing on lower price and they can make more profit selling their high margin photonic chips to these manufacturers (they even wished IPG “good luck with that” as IPG enters this transceiver market with Finisar). It was also interesting that they suggested they may make another acquisition within a year.
"3D Touch: Apple may be looking at ways to improve 3D Touch on the iPhone, reports AppleInsider. A recent patent reveals that the company may use VCSEL technology to improve how 3D Touch works. This is the same technology that the company uses in Face ID. However, this is still a patent and AAPL may not move forward with these plans. Any news about APPLE using Lumentum for this tech? Owned this stock for a few weeks. It has ripped from $42 fast. I don't see any resistance above until $53 ish. Lets hope this momentum keeps us going North."
I think lite the acquisition at right time before LITE share price goes too high or vice versa for COHR. Cohr is an established company with positive earning. shall not be a burden for LITE. over time their combination open new market opportunities and fast product development to avoid having parallel research team. great move
"LITE has a short position of 15% as of January, 28 where the price was at mid 90st. The short position has been increased from 12 to 15. This could give a good signal for short squeeze."

$LITE taking off and heading back up to $100+ very soon.
"As promised to Brian, here's my market neutral P&F update. The main overall market indicators are all in columns of Os. The $bpspx is at 66.8%, the $bpnya is at 65.8% and the $bpcompq is at 54.5%. A rough rule of thumb on these bullish percent charts is 70% or higher is overbought territory, while 30% and below is oversold territory. When a chart is in a column of Os momentum is negative and when it's in Xs momentum is positive.MKSI, LITE and IIVI all had big moves to the upside over the past few days. It's interesting that they all moved as a group. MKSI was up 7.03%, LITE was up 7.22% and IIVI was up 5.71% Friday. COHR was up 1.19%. I've said many times over the past 12 months that normal buy and sell signals have become very unreliable. You might get one or two a year. Now you get one or two a week. Lots of volatility and uncertainty exists for both longs and shorts."

"Analyst Thomas O'Malley from Barclays maintained a Buy rating on Lumentum Holdings (LITE), with a $90 price target."
"LITE at current price has a forward PE of only 13.3 . With the recent margin improvement, and accelerating revenue growth LITE can easily reach 100 in short term and the forward PE will be just 18. Analyst have underestimated LITE's valuation and price forecast in my opinion. Someone mentioned Apple's 5G rollout next year. And Trade talks seems promising in the short term at least. LITE is a sweet spot and playing its cards very well. Doesnt mean it wont go through a bit correction here and there but the upward movement is solidly intact. Happy Thanksgiving to All."
"LITE acquiring COHR seemed like a good strategy for the medium/longer term even though LITE's stock price would suffer in the short term. Then came the MKSI offer. Now with IIVI getting into the picture, things get really difficult. What's the best outcome of the three:1) LITE pays up to acquire COHR2) MKSI acquires COHR3) IIVI acquires COHR"
$FN reported strong earnings solid beat on both revs and eps - solid guidance as well
its about time!! going back to $95
just listened to the webinar. Nothing new was learned. Chris knows tthe business well and they are betting on a sector direction that sounds promising. Android slow to adopt but 2nd half and 2020 should see the ramp. Roadm business very strong visibility several quarters out. Oclaro products best in market reason for the buyout along with cost savings and ability for more and faster R&D. Few more bits but that was the extent. Baring and market correction or recession we should see good upward price movement throughout this year.
Revenue is up. Projected revenue is up. This will hit 90 soon.
"Well, it’s funny. LITE doesn’t manufacture their own stuff. The bigger question here, is, what do those agreements with the contract manufacturers look like? It seems to be quite overlooked. Their patent portfolio for VCSELs is not as broad as FNSR. Something smells funny here, more broadly than is being disclosed."
Been holding up better than iivi
Received proxy vote today and voted against all as a protest to the stock price. Do something to get this undervalued price up.
"Work at home keeping spending strong in 5G, datacom and storage. Demand for the high end smartphones still a big question mark. Interest in lower and mid range phones 4 - 1 higher according to recent mobile report. I think until the high end market improves LITE will be range bound with swift momentum swings in both directions."
"The only negative questions from analysts on the CC dealt with Huawei. The answers were direct but a little sugar-coated. Lumentum claimed that the goods that they ship to Huawei were of a generic nature and that inventory could be shipped to other customers. Conversely, they said they were involved in R/D with Huawei? If Huawei is choked out of business, the Lumentum business will simply move to the customers that fill that void. Today's news spooked the market but overall the impact on Lumentum will be minimal. We might have to wait for the next CC to see how things settle out as this news comes in the middle of the quarter. Lumentum traditionally has very little to say between CC. Losing a customer of this size [10%] will hold the SP down. [stating the obvious]"
The two next key levels are $59 and $64. Run a point & figure chart. $59 breaks the downtrend and then $64 takes us not only through the bearish resistance line but also breaks through that double top at $63.
"As early as the beginning of this year, Samsung stated that it would shut down all its LCD panel production lines in South Korea and China by the end of this year, that is, it completely abandoned LCD production and shifted its production capacity to quantum dot QD-OLED display panels.It has now been officially confirmed that Samsung’s QD-OLED TV panels will be launched sometime in the year 2021. The others, LG, Apple etc are doing the same. As stated earlier, there is a major move away from LED to OLED and QD-OLED and microLed panels for direct-view displays and used in wearable devices, automotive displays, smartphones, tablets, mobile PCs, monitors, and TVs and many other applications. Coherent is the leading supplier of manufacturing equipment needed to produce these.... at $20 million+ per touch.

"A friend says that a 700 Million buy back of shares would/will reduce the number of shares by 13% . (Assuming they buy at or near current levels). That would also increase earnings per share by 13%. So, as you said in a Bullish scenario we would assume LITE would return to previous 52 week high on 112 so if we add 13% on top of 112 we get a price of 127 within the next 12 to 18 months. Note if sales increase significantly, the price could and will go much higher."
"$57.21 is the 200 MA which is the next resistance point, hopefully tomorrow it will go through it."
"I have BILLY on ignore now.As far as the Point & Figure charts are concerned, the overall market sentiment is captured in the bullish percent charts for the S&P 500 ($bpspx), NYSE ($bpnya) and NASDAQ ($compq). The bullish percent is the percentage of stocks on P&F buy signals. The S&P 500 bullish percent went as low as 12% in late Dec and now has moved up to 46% (quite a move). The NASDAQ went as low as 20% and is now at 38%. The NYSE went as low as 20% and is also at 38% right now. What you look for is when any of those 3 charts flips back to a column of Os. Then you have to think defensively.For LITE, the key was a bearish signal reversal when it traded at $44. We then ran into resistance at $46 and now have to deal with resistance at $48. If we can get through $48, then there's another resistance area in the $52-$53 zone.LITE's earnings call is coming up. For the last several quarters the stock price hasn't reacted the way you would think based on the actual numbers or the guidance. So, keep that in mind as the date approaches."
"Nice break for LITE:II-IV cc:Although the (Sherman) fab was qualified in the September quarter and was well-positioned to begin buying shipments in the December quarter, a technical issue required some additional attention and that work is causing a delay. We are working closely with our largest 3D Sensing customers to implement and to qualify the improvements that have been identified, and as of today our conservative view is that we will begin shipping in the March quarter."

looks like we can say good bye to double digits. Been a long time coming. Congrats longs
"Based on too many years of trading JDSU and now LITE, when you hear convertible bond offering or merger it's usually a good sign to become very cautious. At first, the stock goes down. Then some analyst talks about how it's different this time. Either the merger is so great or the money from the convertible bond offering is going to be used for something so amazing. I think both bring scenarios bring in another set of traders that know how to manipulate even more than the usual manipulators."
"LITE is a buy option for the following reasons:1. Technically, it has oversold. The stock has beat market expectations and as they come and upgrade it, it will quickly come back to its upside trend. 2. The future is bright for the stock specially after the last purchase.The bottom has already reach though. Today, I purchased some and will buy again in near future."

iivi basically confirmed our guidance for the second half and how strong all parts of their business will be. If we can limit the impact from Corona. And Huawei can stay out of the news. It should be a fun rest of the year.
"Are we having fun yet? This is now the 17th or 18th time that LITE gets a huge down move based on the manipulators. Yes, they've been back at it again since the earnings report. This was prior to the trade war stuff. On the Point & Figure chart, we had that huge move down in November, then slow, steady grinding price action through March. There was lots of volatility within the over chart pattern, but it was positive - even though it didn't feel like it. Then in March/April, we had a nice move to get up to $62, a slight pull back then a higher high at $63 right before earnings.The first lower low came at $58. That was a reversal in momentum of the chart pattern. I was asked to comment at the time and I said the charts are pretty much useless when you're dealing with outside factors like trade wars, Huawei stuff, etc. You can get fake buy and sell signals, so all you can do is take your position and not look at it too frequently. We're always one tweet or news flash away from a move in one direction or the other.Huawei is NOT new information. Anyone who has been trading and following LITE and the sector is (and has been) aware of the situation. I remember posting several months ago asking a question if Huawei's loss becomes gains for other companies. In other words, if LITE is selling $X of goods to Huawei, would a competitor to Huawei now buy those exact same products from LITE? So, this was an issue back then otherwise I wouldn't have asked the question.Back to the P&F chart...We've pulled back to the bullish support line. Does that mean anything? In this environment, I'd say it's a useful piece of information, but nothing you would base a trade on. It's useful just to know where you're at on the chart. This is much more of a news driven price action environment for LITE."
"I would encourage everyone to listen to yesterday’s Raymond James 41st Annual Institutional Investors Conference. A very solid and confident performance here by Chris. Corona Virus situation remains fluid. From the China supply point of view most of that supply chain was moved to Taiwan already. Their remaining (small) factory in China has 80% of the workforce working. Prior to CV pre Coronavirus demand exceeded supply which gave Lumentum a buffer. Said competitors may be more exposed than they are. Huawei questions answered at 8.06 minutes in. There has been no published changes to the deminimus rules relating to Hauwei and Chris said he wouldn’t expect much impact even if the muted changes were made. Huawei, as we know, is moving away from US components where it can but Chris said that it’s very doubtful that Huawei could replicate/replace the high-end products Huawei needs from Lumentum.3D sensing discussed a little mid way in but this topic is more deeply discussed at 18.01 minutes in. 3D market opportunities moving into many faculties of use and market value could grow by a factor of x10+ multiple from where we are now.

Would $lite be involved in the autonomous car announced by Apple?
"shaking in my boots holding this into earnings. With Covid cases growing I believe that must be affecting our supply chain. LT, not a bit worried. So today's move is buying from those that believe earnings/guidance will be good or part of the buyback but would be shocked if they were knowing earnings weren't good."
Many times the market will hold a stock down after strong earnings and a strong forecast. Take out all the stop losses and short-term traders. I've read all of today's analysis and cannot see anything that would prevent LITE from hitting $70 in the next 2 months.
"Michael, can you please give us an update on the charts. I always appreciate your input."
"I share some posters views' about the agenda of some of Lumentum Analysts. Stock has dropped 28% since its high of $69 with two earnings misses, Apple's deal with FNSR, and now the projected short fall in the iPhone X shipments. Yet, not a single down grade and 10 Analysts remain at Buy!"
"Well, well, well, the Sleepy Joe DOJ released the Huawei Executive. I just wonder what it means for LITE???"
Could it be that this recent momentum to the upside is for real??
Getting ready to pop? yes or no?
pretty ugly day! We must have run out of buyback money?
Anybody think LITE will have any surprise new components in the Apple products coming out in the next few weeks. The last conference call sounded good for demand for their products. Like everyone else the chip shortage is costing them big revenue.
"Market reaction seems to think this is a good thing owing to the leverage LITE would have taken.I think its a good decision. LITE can resume its path back up to $100 in the short-medium term.Of course, what COHR does for IIVI future remains to be seen. Could be a long term benefit, but they'll have to deal with the expenses of this deal."
"From SA , ripe for buy out...............""Lumentum is a leading provider of optical and photonic technology. We anticipate significant consolidation within the optical industry in coming years, but see Lumentum as a company which could offer technical know-how and additional product lines to an acquirer with customer overlap, which could offer a high level of operational efficiencies and scale. The company also operates in some consumer industries which may offer value to sell-off in a future transaction or could work with a company that also offers consumer-based products. According to the company's latest 10-K, its key customers in 2018 were Apple (AAPL) at 30% of sales, Huawei at 11%, and Ciena (CIEN) at 11%. Cisco (CSCO) was 12.4% of 2017 revenues, but was less than 10% in 2018.Source: Lumentum Holdings 2018 10-K LITE 10-K (2018)With a more reasonable valuation following the double impact of slowing sales of Apple products and the U.S. ban on Huawei, we believe that Lumentum is now properly priced for a potential suitor to become more aggressive in looking at a potential acquisition. With a current NTM EV/Sales multiple of 1.9x and a Forward P/E of ~9x, the current valuation is more than likely assuming a significant downturn in the company's future opportunities. We disagree, as datacenter speeds continue to increase and the move towards photonics increases, we believe Lumentum will remain a leader. The Apple business will likely ebb and flow, but has allowed the company to broaden its base from previously primarily only serving communications customers.Assuming a median NTM EV/Sales takeout multiple of 3x, in line with broad semiconductors, the company, if acquired in the future, could potentially offer upside from current levels of ~55-60%."""
"zuperzee2003...This is P&F Michael. Thinking back to our key factors to watch, have you seen any changes in the past few weeks?1) Impact of IIVI2) High end smartphone demand3) US China trade 4) 5G buildoutThe P&F chart is currently on a buy signal. This is the 7th buy signal since earnings last Feb. Each of the previous buy signals pulled back strong enough to give a sell signal. The overall market upside hysteria has made positioning in LITE even tougher. If the market decides it wants to give back some of these gains, LITE will likely go along for a ride to the downside. If it keeps going up, LITE will follow.Regardless of what they report this quarter and guide for the next, the stock price has tended to ""do it's own thing"" post earnings. If I would have known the numbers and guidance ahead of time, I wouldn't have been able to position accordingly. Look at last Feb when we had excellent earnings and guidance with a cautious note regarding Covid 19. Then in May we had just horrible guidance (worse than anything I'd ever seen trading JDSU and then LITE for 20 years) and the stock actually went up for awhile.So I guess I'm looking for the most recent thoughts from others as we approach the May earnings report."
