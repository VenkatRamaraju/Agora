We may all stop shaking in our boots now. Quarterly results exceeding expectations and future forecast picking up. Nice! Let's roll back into the $90's!
"Maintained as Strong Buy at Raymond James . Price target $96, raised from $85."
Revenue is up. Projected revenue is up. This will hit 90 soon.
"Well, well, well, the Sleepy Joe DOJ released the Huawei Executive. I just wonder what it means for LITE???"
"Haven't seen report, how many shares were bought?"
Received proxy vote today and voted against all as a protest to the stock price. Do something to get this undervalued price up.
Been holding up better than iivi
Do nothing management is the problem... When will we see $120 per share???
$LITE taking off and heading back up to $100+ very soon.
pretty ugly day! We must have run out of buyback money?
Maintained as Neutral at Rosenblatt . Price target $85
I'm back in. I have been riding NVDA for the last few months. Today was the day to start a new position with LITE for the 4th time. Ha the 4th time is always the charm.
Anybody think LITE will have any surprise new components in the Apple products coming out in the next few weeks. The last conference call sounded good for demand for their products. Like everyone else the chip shortage is costing them big revenue.
Could it be that this recent momentum to the upside is for real??
Here are a few ideas not related to point & figure charts that I think we can all agree on:1) Analysts have very little credibility2) Much of the movement of an individual stock price is driven by the movement of the overall market and the sector3) It helps to think more market neutral than fall in love with a bullish or bearish narrative4) Thinking about ideas like I listed in my previous post helps frame the problem of how you should be positioned in an individual stock. I don't know the answers but I do know the questions I'd be asking management during the conference call.It would be great to get some good discussion going prior to the conference call next week.

"Analyst Thomas O'Malley from Barclays maintained a Buy rating on Lumentum Holdings (LITE), with a $90 price target."

"shaking in my boots holding this into earnings. With Covid cases growing I believe that must be affecting our supply chain. LT, not a bit worried. So today's move is buying from those that believe earnings/guidance will be good or part of the buyback but would be shocked if they were knowing earnings weren't good."
Tme for them to start looking for a buyer.
