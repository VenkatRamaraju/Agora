NHI is up 11.92% to 48.31
"The company is fine, the dividend is very good, but the stock isn’t gonna go anywhere in the climate they’re in. Too many rent deferrals, occupancy should be higher, etc... Until Covid is gone, if ever, this is simply gonna lag the market, there’ll be no growth in their numbers, just a slow decrease continuing for the near future at least..."
Why is this down >7%?
"I also wish the company would make an announcement of some kind. All health REITs are taking a beating, but NHI is falling more than most. Would be nice if the company would issue some reassurance."
Is this a good price to get in or wait for a pull back?
This is such a buy.
Market at all time high and NHI is off over $10.00 from its high. ??? Why

"Congratulations to everyone who had the guts to plug our nose with one hand, and use the other hand to click buy around this time last year. The so-called experts say to never try and time the market, I say BS.Dollar cost averaging isn't all it's cracked up to be. Take the dividends in cash, and when an opportunity presents itself (like it did last year around this time) put that cash to work.http://www.imagebam.com/image/14662f1371959222"

"I am shareholder of $NHI. In addition to being a shareholder, I also have a family member living in a continuous care retirement community. The CCRC has banned all outside contact and arescreening employees for temperature and wellness before they can enter the facility. TheCCRC is taking all precautions to protect its residents. When this crisis has passed, and it will, there is going to be a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase the shares of this company at prices you may never see again."
"I have been a shareholder of NHI for over 20 years; IMO this is an extraordinary buying opportunity. I've been adding (as it goes down), and I believe I will be money good at the end of the day( well some day). They just announced decent earnings and raised their dividend. Great demographics behind their industry, and they are well and conservatively managed. Good investing."
Loading up. Great dividend
"This is looking good, loving the uptick in the market."
Now I know how Randolph & Mortimer Duke feel at the end of trading places :)

The lowest number of deaths since March 30. It overs. Meanwhile stock markets and people's retirement accounts have been devastated all around the world."

Zacks- what a waste of everyone's time. Those people are morons.

"NHI did NOT reduce the dividend in 2008-2010........a real financial crisis as compard to today's media induced covid panic. Also, and aging population and the end of life is the business of NHI.

"$NHI : CEO InterviewWe currently have over 240 properties, and as I said, most of them are in senior housing. We try to curate our mix, if you will, but being a REIT is a very opportunistic business. You have to play the cards that you’re dealt, and the types of deals that you want to do are not always available or not always available at a price that makes sense for your cost of capital.We try very hard to make all of our acquisitions accretive. There is a school of thought where an acquisition doesn’t need to be accretive in the beginning and that you’ll get a return through property appreciation.Some REITs are exploring that as a business model, but we are very conservative with our investment philosophy and believe that we should only pay a price that allows us to make money year one based on our cost of capital.https://www.twst.com/news/dividend-yield-5-health-care-facility-provider-investment-making/"

"So, once The Virus has been at least subdued, and life is getting on, it doesn’t seem to me that retirement homes and facilities such as those owned by NHI will cease to operate. If anything they will have an increasing number of users with the aging of The Boomers. People might go to fewer malls, restaurants, cinemas, etc, but aging is not an option. The need NHI businesses will not subside. Fear will surround placing a loved one in a home for awhile, but necessity will prevail. Does the market think NHI will be bankrupted by lawsuits? Otherwise, it seems the businesses will continue to be viable, perhaps more so that assets owned by retail/restaurant/entertainment oriented REITS. Right?"
"Wow, what a dead board! Maybe that's a good thing, I don't see any spam :)I retired early & I'm using NHI for income. I love the 6.00% yield & the fact that for another 7 to 10 years we'll have a steady stream of baby boomers retiring, which translates into a steady stream of customers."

"Is NHI facing bankruptcy? That the only thing I can think of when I see this free fall. I've owned NHI for more than a decade and love the stock. But I'm truly scared. Bought quite a bit on the way down, but it's falling so fast I can't keep up."

Never try to buy a falling knife. Let it bounce on the floor for a while before you pick it up.
