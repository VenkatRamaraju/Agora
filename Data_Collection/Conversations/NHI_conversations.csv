Moody’s downgrade and Earnings announced Monday. What are peoples thoughts?
NHI Fundamental Review: Net Cash Flow from Operations - DOWN $20.6 Milll from last yearGross Margin - DOWN .27% from last yearTotal Assets - DOWN 0.4 BILLION from last year (liquidating assets to pay debt)According to analyst : National Health has about a 72 percent probability of financial distress in the next few years of operation and has generated negative returns over the last 120 days. As for the dividend - expect to see a steep cut of 30-40%.Full disclosure: I'm an option trader- I currently have puts for $50.
"NHI did NOT reduce the dividend in 2008-2010........a real financial crisis as compard to today's media induced covid panic. Also, and aging population and the end of life is the business of NHI. Plus fitch rates the company's financials stable...............NHI IS A BUY WITH ITS HIGHEST YIELD IN ITS HISTORY."
"You have to give credit where credit is due. The guy (Varun Valmiki) who 4 months ago posted he was buying $50 puts & we all blew him off, nailed it. Where is the bottom ?"
NHI is cheap at the moment (P/E of 17 or 18). Just compare with CAH (P/E of 25).
$839.63 in dividends today!I've never gotten anywhere that amount during any previous quarter ?The little lightbulb finally flickered when I remembered how many shares I've added over the last 2.5 monthsToo bad I couldn't have reinvested it on a day when it wasn't up 7.10%Hopefully a cost basis of $52.67 looks cheap down the road.Almost happy hour!Cheers!
"So, once The Virus has been at least subdued, and life is getting on, it doesn’t seem to me that retirement homes and facilities such as those owned by NHI will cease to operate. If anything they will have an increasing number of users with the aging of The Boomers. People might go to fewer malls, restaurants, cinemas, etc, but aging is not an option. The need NHI businesses will not subside. Fear will surround placing a loved one in a home for awhile, but necessity will prevail. Does the market think NHI will be bankrupted by lawsuits? Otherwise, it seems the businesses will continue to be viable, perhaps more so that assets owned by retail/restaurant/entertainment oriented REITS. Right?"
"The company is fine, the dividend is very good, but the stock isn’t gonna go anywhere in the climate they’re in. Too many rent deferrals, occupancy should be higher, etc... Until Covid is gone, if ever, this is simply gonna lag the market, there’ll be no growth in their numbers, just a slow decrease continuing for the near future at least..."
Shouldn't we have received the quarterly dividend by now?I see it's usually paid out at end of June.
"Very good and encouraging NHI financial results. One of the best senior health care reit with high profit margin, increasing yearly dividends and low payout ratio. GLTA"
"I am shareholder of $NHI. In addition to being a shareholder, I also have a family member living in a continuous care retirement community. The CCRC has banned all outside contact and arescreening employees for temperature and wellness before they can enter the facility. TheCCRC is taking all precautions to protect its residents. When this crisis has passed, and it will, there is going to be a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase the shares of this company at prices you may never see again."
is this a good stock to invest in
I bought more at 60 per. All the seniors in this country have to go somewhere.
"If it reaches the mid 50s, I may have to consider reinvesting dividends again."
"Keep the faith... Once the Vaccine gets distributed globally, this will be back up at its all time high in no time."
I bought more this morning. this is undervalued. long term perspective is good too. #Agingsociety
Another one to load up on after the election volatility plays out. When everyone’s buying the tech dip I’ll be buying high div plays like this!
"Congratulations to everyone who had the guts to plug our nose with one hand, and use the other hand to click buy around this time last year. The so-called experts say to never try and time the market, I say BS.Dollar cost averaging isn't all it's cracked up to be. Take the dividends in cash, and when an opportunity presents itself (like it did last year around this time) put that cash to work.http://www.imagebam.com/image/14662f1371959222"
Loading up. Great dividend
"$NHI : CEO InterviewWe currently have over 240 properties, and as I said, most of them are in senior housing. We try to curate our mix, if you will, but being a REIT is a very opportunistic business. You have to play the cards that you’re dealt, and the types of deals that you want to do are not always available or not always available at a price that makes sense for your cost of capital.We try very hard to make all of our acquisitions accretive. There is a school of thought where an acquisition doesn’t need to be accretive in the beginning and that you’ll get a return through property appreciation.Some REITs are exploring that as a business model, but we are very conservative with our investment philosophy and believe that we should only pay a price that allows us to make money year one based on our cost of capital.https://www.twst.com/news/dividend-yield-5-health-care-facility-provider-investment-making/"
