"From 2001 to 2008 before bankruptcy WMI set up 692 BILLION in secure trusts BEFOREBankruptcy, & that is going to be source of income for a long time to come, interest from trusts for 9 years, & then each quarter afterwards."
Another $2/share earnings.P/E is less than 4 !This stock should be $80
4:00 PM will tell as that is what goes into accounts.
"And another 200 million loss,let's give Bray another bonus."
"My agenda, hmmm . . . well it's dark blue, really a royal blue, circa 1978. Beyond that I'm not saying."
"Does anyone know how WMIH is going to ""refinance"" some $1.5 Billion of debt?"
"We appear to be stuck at eighty cents. Too bad. Really got excited when I saw it cross $1.00 in AH trading a few days ago. Didn't realize someone buying a lousy 10 shares could have that big of an effect on the pps. Seems impossible, but I guess there is no other explanation.Now, we're right back where we've been all along. Watching for meaningful news that rarely if ever comes. Gotta tell you, in all the years I've invested in the stock market, I don't ever recall owning a stock that has been as frustrating as this puppy.They say, all good things come to those who wait. Dunno. They might have been talking about Jobe!"
"Reality check for those seeking ""hidden billions""In 2007 WaMu held $307 billion in loans (assets)....with liabilities of $271 billion ( owed $82.9 billion to Fed Home loan Bank and $188.3 to ""depositors""). 4th qtr of 2007 WaMu wrote off $67 billion of the assets as bad loans....3rd qtr of 2008 there was a run on cash total of $22 billion withdrawn in 10 days which made the bank illiquid. Chase took over in Sept of 2008 and immediately wrote of another $31 billion in bad loans. Math is simple.....$307-98= $$209 billion in assets. $209 billion in assets minus bad loan write offs of $98 billion equals NEGATIVE assets of $72 billion. The retained earnings (the actual worth of the bank in it's own money was $25 billion...........beginning too see why there are no hidden assets, miracle money to be found, or any other hope for recovery ?? The imbedded derivitive is the one and only reason for the current play be HF and other investors. When that play is over.....it will be chapter 7 as there is no hope of ever merging or buying any other company."
.70 support. Fails. That .80 spot to short was a golden opp
It took a little longer than I expected to get above 20.Now how long before above 40? One year?
over 90% held by institution. No wonder you don't see much posting here. Love seeing the 1-yr chart. Slow and steady moving up.
If WMIH is worth $702 million after the merger then I would assume that the share price should almost triple. Am I right?
"E Mailed today to Chad Smith:Dear Chad,The situation here is absolutely pathetic, as Management drains off valuable cash while they claim ""it's a difficult merger environment"". Why not dump ""management"" and just keep aboard an accounting firm to handle the day to day business..that saves a few million each year, or buy a small specialty financial institution and then do a ""roll up"". I think your shareholders wouldn't mind having a company that at the least, has some potential. At the present moment..you have nothing to hang your hat on but a bunch of ""do nothing"" Board members and upper management who are just looking for their own revenue stream. I think it's time to press the matter at the next shareholder meeting, as Management has already indicated, ""they can't facilitate a merger in these difficult times"".In fact, you've been on the dole for many years yourself..so I guess an impartial response is all but impossible, but I'd like one !Shareholder,Larry"
"COOP moving up nicely of late. Should continue to do well as home builders switch to building lower priced homes that will be attractive to first time buyers. For the past five or six years, builders have focused on mini-mansions with prices starting around $500,000.00 and moving upwards from there to a million or more. Still lots of land available across the country proximate to major cities that has gone undeveloped. That's gonna change very soon. JMHO, but when that starts, or more precisely, when WS realizes that is now the plan for home builders, COOP will advance handsomely. By this time next year, I see the pps comfortably in the $20s."
down a total 9.5% for the total day! WoW
Tick tock. 16 more days before Jan 1
"Keeping it real BNGO may close red today, no big deal here, $coop up more yukky yuk."
"On the last page of the latest presentation, anyone know what are the ""legacy assets"" mentioned in the footnote #2.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933136/000115752320000820/a52226829ex99_1.htm"
Merry Christmas to all.
Wonder where Albetross & buddies are now??? You probably will not see them post again. I can not see their post as I have them MUTED.
WILL SEE $35 ANY DAY NOW
"In all of the press releases and articles that I have read, not one of them has mentioned the NOL's that WMIH is in control of. These NOL's are why WMIH is alive. I have been involved with WMIH since Home Savings & Loan were taken over by Great Western Savings and the were taken over by Washington Mutual then gifted to Chase by the FDIC. It my opinion, the NOL's have enormous value."
Go to Yahoo! Finance COOP click Analysis and you wil see that the Analysis raised Coop estimate for all of coop qt last week
"$0.90/share net earnings for Q3. If they can keep that up, this stock is going to $30."
"Credit Suisse March 7, 2019 ;-Reiterate Outperform: COOP's 4Q earnings should highlight the stability of servicing earnings plus the highly visible growth in servicing balances for 2019. These 2 factors coupled with the stock selling at a discount to book value (adjusted for NPV of DTA), results in the stock offering an attractive risk-reward"
Even at $40 COOP is undervalued.
Big funds are not happy. These preferred investors are ticked off
"New acquisition today. COOP continues to build an MSR servicing portfolio, which benefits from rising rates and home owners staying in their homes during a cooling housing market."
The DB JPM FDIC settlement is to take place by Feb 25 2018 for about 65 BILLION.
"That's a lot of profit , for what they have to do for it ."
"Looks like WMIH is gonna meet that $1.00 requirement long before the deadline. Saw it was up .03 in AH trading, so that puts us right around .99 heading into next week. Hope the IHUB rumor one poster alluded to about a December 18th announcement comes to pass. We long suffering longs are certainly due some positive news. Gotta be a good reason why the hedge fund guys bought and held. Should not be this way, but they know more than we do. Thus, we mere mortals will just have to sit back and wait to find out what they already seem to know."
COOP up 59 cents on over 2 MILLION total shares traded. Wonder what is up now?
Cooperman owns a much greater % of OCN which trades at a p/b of 0.2. Big difference in valuation.
Good to see this stock finally grow some legs.
"What is the fate of WMIH (WAMU) escrow shares?Where are the WMIH board and litigation trust members, who touted potential payments from JPM-FDIC ???"
looks the market thinks the merger will happen. exchange 12 WMIH shares @ $1.50 = $18 = 1 NSM share at the wmih purchase offer of $18.
Monday tip of the day. When a stock is down 3% or lower on heavier than normal volume that is NOT bullish. Some thing volume is a bullish think even if it’s down. Ummmm. Nope
There’s a Christmas tree stand down the road from me with about 4 trees left. I wonder if wmih could buy the whole business and help us patient shareholders out
Tomorrow is the day will be over 13
"Are there any other assets remaining from the original WM and/or WMIH that we are still in line to receive? Seems to me that I recall certain deposits that went to JPM that they did not have a right to get. Thoughts, anyone?"
"At least 15 big whales & Funds buying WMIH, Cohen in private account Vanguard added over 3 million, information out after the quarter. They must know something we do not."
@Va THANK YOU! Thanks TO YOU I got out at $22... Might be best to stay on the sidelines for a while....
"Not a happy cmaper, but on this stock you will just have to bite the bullet for the next couple of Q's. Coop's management is aggressive, deep pockets and an eye to be the one of the biggest full servicing companies in the industry. KKR doesn't need small timers..be patient. And, while your waiting take a piece of OBE, cheap oil stock ready to make the move as the positives are starting to become realities. Numbers improving every month and so is the addition of pipelines to transport oil in Canada and US."
"So, this company sold it's 365 title business, and now has dumped it's Xome business, which if you listened to the last earnings call was going to be a major growth factor for the business. So they have refinances and loan servicing, both of which are expected to decline and result in 30% less revenue in the upcoming quarters. Their biggest investor has sold completely out of the stock, and withdrew their seat on the board. Something bad is brewing..."
COOP SHOULD TRADED NO LESS THAN 1 1/2 TIMES BOOK VALUE 25.76 X 1.5 = 38.64
82% of shares of COOP are owned by institutions
"Mr. Willingham did NOTHING for litigation trust and escrow shares, during the past 6 years? Just amazing!!!Mr. Willingham has served as a director since March 2012. Since June 2002, Mr. Willingham has been a principal at Willingham Services, which provides consulting advice for a diverse portfolio of clients and constituencies regarding strategic considerations involving complex litigation across a variety of industries, including energy, financial services and varying wholesale/retail products. Mr. Willingham is a member of the Trust Advisory Board and Litigation Subcommittee of WMI Liquidating Trust (the “Trust”). Mr. Willingham chairs the Audit Committee and is a member of the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee."
"According to filing yesterday HF & institutional holders are still adding==FSI Group NEW ADDED 438,306 shares Schwab added 42,896. As long as Funds keep adding They must know something we do not."
this stock is so under the radar
The reason WMIH price is down now is due to the issuing of the 416 Million shares issued on 5 /29 as part of the merger.
"Yes this has turned out to be an absolute “disaster” of an “investment” for the past decade. My bet is that everyone that was here for the wamu potential payout has already taken a big loss and left. This company will probably do ok longer term for new investors (probably +10% annually if one holds for the next decade), but other than that, all hopes for a large payout are all but gone at this juncture."
"Down about .35 over the past few weeks. Puzzled with this action, especially since so many of the hedge funds have been buyers.Gotta admit, WMIH is the most frustrating stock I have ever owned. I truly have no clue about what may or may not happen next.Thoughts?"
"Opinion: Now USA Corporate Tax rate is 21 percent and AT-T is giving a $1,000 per person employee bonus: business is in a new Paridine whitch is unprecidented new jobs, manufacturing jobs. ect. ect. > Also business men will rethink all their business plans and place them in the USA. Now. Regarding WMIH eventually from the back of these gentlemen in charge of WMIH that thought will work its way up to the front on their brain and they too will cause WMIH to be let say $4.00 to $10.00 a share. It is a new business world in the USA Cheers."
I don't have a position in COOP but am very seriously considering buying this week.
AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HABLAMCHILD HAS A TINY PP
"Be real. COOP won't move until they show a clear and convincing structure endeavoring to do a ""roll up"" in their industry. One more merger and COOP will start to move..chunks at a time ! You've been patient for years..what's another year as COOP gets ready for another merger...hopefully sooner than later !"
"Lou: The price will stay in that range until the merger is complete, 1.41 is the established price."
"Albetross there are two kinds of mortgage companies - originator and servicer. Originators create new loans and do terrible when rates go up and people sit in their homes and not buy new ones. Servicers make money on existing loan portfolios so does not matter if people stop buying/selling homes. COOP is the largest non-bank servicer, and has a giant pipeline for MSR loans. MSR portfolios GAIN VALUE AS RATES GO UP and lose value as rates go down. Google MSR loan to learn more, its not a secret. KKR knows exactly what they are doing. They waited for a change in macro economics to do the deal - rates are going up finally. COOP is buying MSR's for pennies and are now positioned to profit."
Got in at 5.85 then sold 7.50 call options win win for me￼
NICE JUST HIT 52 WEEK HIGH $38 NEED TO GO OVER $39 FOR ALL TIME HIGH
"With low mortgage rates, people are re-financing by the droves. COOP stands to make a lot of money just on processing fees and the like. True, the loan rate is low but so is their cost of money. All that really counts, in terms of profits i.e., is the spread between the two. Right now, with the Fed holding rates damn near zero, that spread is healthy.Was good to hear famed WS analyst, Leon Cooperman, plug COOP on TV about a week ago.Gonna run to $40? Eventually, especially with more people returning to work, but not today. I'm pretty conservative, so COOP finishing the year at $25 would be acceptable. GLA."
"Fannie Mae just hit us all with a 50 Basis Point ""Covid Adverse Market"" hit to pricing, which is nothing more than a money grab. This is going to affect the margins of all the lenders, and rates have increased because of it. After hours, they announced this #$%$ so that we couldn't lock the loans in time to save our borrowers from this increase. What a complete farse."
"If you're wondering why we spiked straight up a few minutes ago:I was browsing channels, and by coincidence was on CNBC when Leon Coopermanwas saying that COOP is worth double what its trading at, which is true, but looks like people listen to him."
"""Expect Nothing and You Will Never Be Disappointed""!!!!"
But the funds. The smart funds
NICE CLOSE ALL TIME HIGH
since every1 here likes high risk/reward opps.take a look at billed (blockchain 360)they just got on the American markets a week ago
I predict that the stock will change it's name to COOP and go up 1200% TODAY. Get in NOW!!!!!!!!! Haha
"That 77 CENT purchase sure looks good now, 4 cents from a double. Randall & AAlbetross you should have bought a few!!"
the traders are selling her on the pop. no real news to explain the moves. pure speculation......what could possibly drive the price in such wild swings?
-27.90% growth projection for next year. Not a cause for celebration.
"There is a RUMOR on I-hub about Dec. 18, 2017 about interest on TRUSTS."
Wow 400 million That will make a lot when lent out .
Could COOP be a buyout target of RKT? New price target of $24 to $25 for COOP. That is tge range RKT is trading in. A stock based deal would be very doable for RKT.
"The past few trading sessions have been good. Okay, no quantum leap in the pps, but a steady rise from the high .60s to about .85. Plus, volume has been up. Again, not four or five times as much, but a nice increase just the same.Tells me that someone knows something that they view as a positive. I know, ain't supposed to be that way; i.e. fat cats knowing and we poor slobs not knowing. But at this point, I'll avert my eyes to their shenanigans and ride the upward wave with them.Really looking forward to January, 2018 being the month that truly sheds some light on where WMIH is headed in the future.If the recent rise in the pps and the overall activity is a valid barometer for making a judgement, it looks like we just might be in store for a profitable 2018. Hoping whatever is announced this coming month will get the pps back over $1.00 and that eventually we trade higher from there.Happy New Year (literally!) to everyone."

"Donald the delist will take 180 days with a option for 180 more, so by then WMIH should file to show the way forward. Have you shorted yet, please DO as you will lose your behind as the shorts dropped over 800,000 last quarter & are covering"
since jay bought at 9.35 i feel good about the purchase i just did at 7.50
"I'm posting this for the benefit of any of the ""old investors"" from before the exit from Ch. 11.Yesterday I received a big fat check from the WMI liquidating trust for the remainder of what they owed me forthe WAHUQ shares I bought at the last day before they were removed from trading. Some people called these ""PIERS"" (no idea what that means). When I bought them I thought they were bonds and later the lawyers (that were all working against us, while getting paid from our estate) argued that they were preferred equity, or some other legal cheating (which was the theme of the whole BK court sharade). But, after 10 years or so, I finally got paid, with some interest. The liquidating trust was paying some ridiculously low interest (something like 1%) all these years, but more significantly, they paid part of their debt in these wonderful bonds (notes) that were issued at a discount and paid 13% while slowly getting redeemed at 100%. So all in all, I can't complain (about the WAHUQ, at least). Now what I'm wondering is.... are the Preferred P's next to get paid, or is the money finished?I had large amounts in face value of the P's (which got converted to some CUSIP ""placeholder"") so it would make my day to find out that these will get paid, too. I wanted to share the good news about the WAHUQs getting paid. Anyone know anything about the Preferred P (I already forgot their symbol, was it WAMPQ?)."
MERGER APPROVED. 80% WMIH shareholders 93% NSM
"Deciding, do I reinvest these dividends or put them in something more risky?"
3 things are certain for 2018. #1 all time lows will be tested. #2 a reverse split will happen. #3 no victory party in Vegas
"WMIH must have more assets than 702 million as they were approved for a 2.7 BILLION bridge loan, backed by CITI"
Woohoo! Go COOP! I'm finally in the green on this stock.
WOW  ALL TIME HIGH TODAY
Shareholder's equity down to $18.4/share from $21/share couple of months ago.
COOP SHOULD BE TRADING NO LESS THAN 1.5 x BV AS OF TODAY BV 38.89 x 1.5 COOP SHOULD BE$58.33
"hold on, i calculating something"
Sell COOP into the pop
"There is so such thing as a quiet period, If WMIH finds a company to buy, they will announce that they have a contract subject to due dilliigence. What is going on here is KKR wants to screw the shareholders and wants them to see the stock at .60 or .40cents so that they will take anything he has to offer. The co hired their own financial advisor to find another deal, but maybe KKR has the power to stop any deal. Bottom line, I believe we will have a deal but the stock will not go initially over $2.00 BUY BUY BUY"
"Why is WMIH down to 1.29 today, when the merger/buyout is at 1.41? What is up with that?"
"Up handsomely ($1.09) in after hours trading. Good to see KKR is staying the course. Can only speculate that by postponing the debt payment for a year is a harbinger that some kind of deal is in the works. Also encouraged that stock options @ $1.32 were part of the deal. Tells me that those receiving said options fully expect that the pps will be a lot higher that $1.32 when it comes time for them to exercise their options.All in all, pretty good news for we longs who have hungered for meaningful news for a long time. Like I've said all along, those hedge fund guys are into WMIH for a reason, and we all know that their ""reason"" for doing anything is profit.Our ship hasn't come in just yet, but I do believe I see big sails on the distant horizon. GL to all."
"JMHO, but too many fat cat (Hedgies etc.) invested in WMIH to let it die a slow death. Like most of us longs, I have no specific information because we are offered so little of it from the company itself. However, if we read between the lines and look at who has been buying WMIH, we should at the very minimum feel some sense of security. Will WMIH ever trade for $10 per share? Probably not unless something really exceptional occurs. However, I would not be shocked to see the pps rally to $2.00+ if/when some sort of deal is announced. Long term, I'm hoping we get a chance to make a buy/sell decision in the $4.00 area. In short, there's more meat on this bone than meets the eye. Why else would respected WS types invest money in a low-priced stock? here will not be a gradual climb in pps. When WMIH pops, it will come all at once and perhaps without a hint. Just gonna wake up some morning and see the pps up sharply.Finally, I'm not one to encourage others to buy/sell a specific stock. However, given the strong buying by the aforesaid WS types, anyone looking to buy a cheap stock that has a very real chance of doubling or tripling off current levels could do a lot worse than taking up a position in WMIH. Good luck to all we patient longs. Our day will come."
"Zeke: I was wondering the same thing myself. You'd think with the acquisition, posters would have much to talk about. Heck, we had a much more active board when all we had was speculation and hope. One thing is for certain, the paid bashers have taken their keyboards elsewhere.Would be interested in knowing what the board thinks is gonna happen from here on out? To wit, if interest rates rise, so will mortgage rates. Is that a good thing for us? Seems so. I mean the more you collect in mortgage interest has to be a good thing. Right?"
"HAPPY NEW YEAR to ALL, May we be BLESSED with HEALTH,WEALTH & HAPPINESS !!"
"1.40 a share earnings estimate. annualized almost 6.00, so current price is 2x earnings. WOW."
I'm still waiting to get paid for all the washington mutual stocks they stole from us
COOP is supposed to make a acquisition in the first if January.
"COOP nicely moving up to $21+. To all WAMU leftovers who held on for this long, congratulations; and may the flood gates open to escrow!"
"I will admit I was shocked at this dropping so low. I don’t know how much rates will factor into this stock, but I think we are in the middle of smart money accumulation. I don’t see a buy signal yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we get one here in the next few weeks"
Hahahahaha!$mnkd
"Buyout is 1.41, has room to run by Fridays vote."
$6.57 by Friday?
Why is its FCF and operating cash flow all negative? Is there any problem with its assets?Who knows?
"If you loved it a 2.50 you loved it at 2.00. 1.50. 1.00 and now 5 yr lows. And as always fortune favors the bold, some say. At least I️ own it!!!"
"Yes, Randell I am still here & will soon receive the MILLIONS i AM DUE"
"Donald, again NO SPLIT, have 180 days to comply, plus another 180 IF NEEDED In a year of business days we will know which way WMIH is going."
"VERY GOOD post Lou & I agree. Like I said before when the HF & Instit. holders start to bail in any LARGE numbers, will be time to take a look."
COOP WILL GO OVER $35 WHEN 4QT COME OUT
"There are some smart cookies on this site who realize that COOP will have an upside trajectory for years to come. KKR wasn't in this to have a mom & pop mortgage business, their target is to build a behemoth. COOP is poised with it's huge mank of NOL's and endless cash from KKR, Citi and the hedgies to rapidly become one of the largest financial centers of its breed.The last mergers were a dress rehearsal for what's coming because as time goes by, more mergers and the target fish will be bigger. If you can't see this then your sitting under an ""Albatross's"" rear end. To the moon Alice, to the moon !"
"UGHHH, JUST GOT BACK FROM THE GYM. MAXED OUT AT 650 ON BENCH PRESS. MAN AM I SORE."
Must be some value to WMIH some where as they are approved for a 2.5. BILLION Bridge loan.
new format is awful.
"He failed to mention that pre-covid COOP was at .5 book value. Which is where it is at now. Do your homework. This company is fully valued after the pop, I bet he sells soon."
"Court hearing moved up NOV 1, by Judge Mary."
Announced refinance of 850 million debt at about 3 percent lower rate. This will add about 25 million to earnings! Is it legal to make so much?
Finally got that double on 77 cent purchase
"Ryan Another thing ""only value WMIH has"" , What about the trusts set up in 2005 & 2007 by WMI that were bankruptcy REMOTE 13 & 11 years of interest with a higher rated in 05 & 07 amounts to a lot of $$$$$$$$$$."
"I need a mortgage, and it just occurred to me that Mr. Cooper (in which I'm a big investor) is also one of the biggest mortgage loan originators in the U.S. as they bought NationStar which bought GreenLight.Might as well give them (me!) my business."
Looks like Randall and other naysayers were completely wrong when they kept saying there's no hope of merger!
back of about 5.5 million shares should get us to the next price target of $25 by the end of September.
Now that things are positive for WMIH with merger Etc. I guess ever body has left this board.
"A example is Bats statement ""no such thing as quiet period"" which when google find out they are WRONG."
"Randall, just because you do NOT own any WMI/WMIH is no reason to down the merger, as 143 HF plus heavy hitter Cohen & Fink are also in WMIH"
"Willingham/Gallagher & Team, When is the escrow settlement from FDIC/JPM?

Going to 14 by yr end
"From WMIH Corp. 10K Ending 12-31-17 Part 1 Item 1On February 12, 2018, WMIH, Merger Sub and Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation that is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “NSM” (“Nationstar”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Nationstar (the “Nationstar Transaction” or the “Merger”), with Nationstar continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Merger Effective Time”) and as a result of the Merger, each share of Nationstar’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Nationstar, WMIH or Merger Sub or by any Nationstar stockholder who properly exercises and perfects appraisal of his, her or its shares under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share, (i) $18.00 per share in cash, without interest, or (ii) 12.7793 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of WMIH common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“WMIH Common Stock”), subject in each case to pro rata cutbacks to the extent cash or stock is oversubscribed (the “Merger Consideration”). The aggregate amount of cash to be paid as Merger Consideration in the Merger is approximately $1.2 billion. The Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

"Over 100,000,000 loans now in forbearance or default. Wow. That's not a dollar figure, that is an amount of loans that are currently NOT being paid."
It's been a long time since I more than doubled my investment in a stock in under a year. Too bad I only bought a few hundred shares.
"WELL WELL, after averaging down when I purchased more WMIH, I am now $49 ahead on WMIH according to my TD account. BRI looks like you will do OK on the 2000 shares you purchased if you still held them."
"Willingham & WMIH team is saying goodbye & good luck to WMIH escrow holders, after all these years ?!!They don't need to give any update regarding the litigation trust to WMIH escrow holders?WMIH becomes COOP and wamu/wmih escrow holders get poop from JPM/FDIC !!Willingham & WMIH board enriched themselves and totally fooled escrow holders by doing nothing thru litigation trust?!NIce work indeed!!!"

"Am I looking at his chart correctly for COOP? Did this thing spike to $120 back in March? Is that accurate? And if so, what caused it to spike?"
The shares could be worth over $5/sh if the 10 for 1 reverse split occurs! Will hedge funds still be buying after the split?
"Hmm, up 6%, decent volume, no news... I smell it's on some 13F filings? ..anyone?"
"Does bother me a bit tross as I am in WMIH/COOP at 77 cents which AT 12/1 is $9.24, How does it concern you anyway as you DO NOT OWN THE STOCK"
COOP on its way to $21+...
Can anyone explain the two spikes in the chart up to $120Thank you
i very happy right now. i make 5% on investment.
what are aome of the opinions on the drop? Are they burning cash now and increasing debt because they know they have the wmih NOLS to offset a cash operating loss?
Coop/WAND the powerhouse stock of the future.
"Zeke, I'd settle for a slow grind upwards at a penny per day. Despite taking numerous broadsides to its bough over the years, WMIH is still hanging in there. It's like that watch in the old Timex commercials, ""It takes a licking but keeps on ticking!"".One of these days this puppy is gonna opp to the upside. The hedge fund guys ain't gonna let it rot on the vine."

Big vote this week!
Analysis raised COOP estimate for alll qt last week wow 
Im against the reverse stock split. I only have 9 shares. That doesn't give me even 1 share after the split. I guess they will give me cash in lieu.
This stock appears to be a bond
"Wow, this turned out to be a good investment. I wish I had bought more."
"I am new to this and I just sold my 3000 shares and made a small profit. Is it still worth going back in? I heard that this will be a good long term investment. Thanks,"
"WMIH got A DE-LISTING NOTICE on the 14th, have 180 days to bring price up to over $1.00 or 2 other ways to comply. Before then we should know which way WMIH are going."
.60s as I️ predicted. Probably just tax loss selling
COOP is worth more than $60/share.Just look at the earnings.
Sweet move today. Hope the upward trend continues.
"All because the fed is delaying help. They have to protect their assets, so they will push something out and the stock will rebound"

"That 77 cent adding x,xxx shares sure looks good now, did anyone pay attention to my posts about merger 2 days ago??"
anybody here use WMIH Boardpost...site seems to be down or gone for good ??
"FROM IBD:The stock market rebounded this past week, rebounding on President Trump's improving health and hope for a new stimulus deal, despite some whipsaw headlines and Trump tweets on the prospects for more government relief. The major indexes rallied strong while leading stocks did even better.Check out The Big Picture to stay in sync with the market direction.In the latest IBD Weekly, the cover story is on the housing markets and stocks that are booming now. With the work-at-home trend expected to continue, people are no longer buying properties in high-priced cities, notably San Francisco. Instead they're favoring bigger, cheaper homes in the suburbs or beyond. Home sales are surging overall, good news for homebuilders an an array of housing-related companies and stocks."
"Now I understand why this POS can't manage a merger..Management graduated from Trump University. Why don't they just hire an accounting firm to handle the financials as ""nothing"" is happening that requires any executive management..This company is a ""give-me"" to a BS Board of Directors who rubber stamp everything that concerns more additional shares, perks and salary. And ole Willy Boy who ""was our last hope"" of being righteous has been ""bought"" to go along with the ride. Next shareholder meeting should be forced to answer the tough questions..""why are you execs there when nothing is going on"" ?"
Something is afoot. PPS behaving very nicely over the past few sessions. Hope the board has a big ribbon tied around an announcement. Where there is smoke there is fire.
"The Employment Settllement is expected to be heard on 11/6. The judge already warned them that any future delays will cost them $100,000/mo. plus additional legal expenses.The short positions are now under 2% and dropping.

GREAT 1QT BOOK VALUE IS NOW $31.97 COOP SHOULD BE TRADE AT $31.97 x 1.5 = $47.95
-18 March 2019-Credit Suisse; Reiterate Outperform: While GAAP earnings (and book value) will be negatively impacted by the likely negative mark in the first quarter we remain comfortable with the underlying profitability (and cash flow generation) of the servicing business.
"With the Dow climbing and now over 30,000, I'd say buying a stock with a 4.5 PE is pretty darn cheap. Heck, in this environment, 10x earnings can be considered cheap. Thus I conclude COOP's pps still has a lot of room to run. I think $40 (About 7x earnings) is a given and $50 a distinct possibility. Only wish I loaded up last March when the pps fell below $5.00."
"I can see some posters have removed their posts, WONDER WHY"
""" . . . receive, when, as, and IF declared by the Board of Directors of the Company a semi-annual 5.00% . . ."""
Bearish reversal today. 1.00 resistance. Start the delist clock back up. Sorry for the interruption
"Now that they have one merger in the bag, the next will not be far behind as the entire concept here is Growth By Acquisition..""Roll ups"" in the same industry for years to come as ""bulk"" gives them lower operating costs. Find a company that has skinny profits and they can increase those overnight by assimilation. This strategy will make WMIH a powerhouse in the future. All hedgies and big players see what's in the future..a whole line of ducks. #$%$ is a master at this game and the dollars will be there to back it up. Now all you have to do is think profits and no taxes for a decade or two. Any smell of a dividend will blow this stock through the roof. I'm hanging in because even a dummy, ""which we have a full basket of management of"" can't go wrong in this narrow game."
Any idea when coop dividend date is for common shareholders?
Buy your puts and thank me later. The fish is just jumping out of the water.
"Just waiting to see if it happens, SHOULD, but until it does......."
"The HF & Instit holders are still ADDING, Scoggin Mang. LP just bought 720,782 shares as of 9/30/17 AS long as they are stil adding I have no worries about WMIH. On another subject the 180 day period has a option for another 180 if needed."
Also Randall have 3.5 BILLION authorized shares plus 10 million Preferred they can use. Plenty of cash if you keep up with what is going on.
WILL SEE $40 SOON
management if they are worth their salt need to OVERPAY to get any deal they cane before 1/7 deadline. This way the preferred have to convert at $2.25 instead of $1.35
COOP WILL BREAK OUT SOON HANG IN BY NEXT 2 WEEKS
Last few minutes WMIH exploded..$1.51
Appaloosa has 84 MILLION in the series B Preferred
Looks like COOP is on its way back to $1.30.
"Many mutual funds experience their fiscal year end in September. Mutual fund managers, on average, typically sell losing positions before year end.THEN they need to take position in new companies.... COOP, etc..."
Am still keeping an eye on COOP. I was actually about to buy ETSY... But changed my mind. Just waiting for a good entry point for COOP. Want to see where the market is headed.I don't like to have too many positions. Like to have a very few good stocks I have confidence in.
My guess is we see 6 by next dec
"Wow. Servicing over 6% of the entire mortgage market, and 32% of mortgages not being paid or currently in forbearance. That's got to be financially devastating. Right Leon?"
Owning 64% of NSM for one thing.
$0.90 profit/quarter ----> $3.60 profit/yearWith a most conservative P/E of 10 ---> $36 share price.We should scoop up any shares that anyone is willing to part with at these heavily discounted prices.
Worth more based on what? During a roaring economy COOP traded at .4 book. It is now .5 book and they will be losing $ on bad loans from looming foreclosures.
"Lack of information has long been the bane for we shareholders. Truly hard to make a decision to buy or sell when one has scant or zero data on which to base such a decision. Longs can only hope (Pray?) that the board is working feverishly to get some kind of deal in place before the debt is do. Also, I would not rule out a re-working of that debt as a distinct possibility. So long as the board can show debt holders/lenders that ""something"" is afoot, they should be open to restructuring the obligation.It's now been eight long years since I initially bought WMIH, and I hate saying I don't know a whole lot more today than I did way back then. But that's the hand I've been dealt. Am pretty much committed to seeing this through to its conclusion. Just can't convince myself that throwing in the towel at .71 is the wise choice to make.Maybe this Christmas will be the Christmas we get finally a gift? God knows we deserve it."
when are they going to change the symbol? I can't find it yet.
"From WMIH Corp. website Investor Relations tab:WMIH Corp. is a publicly-traded company focused on identifying and consummating an accretive acquisition transaction across a broad array of industries, with a primary focus on the financial institutions sector. In addition to certain legacy reinsurance assets and non-recourse run-off liabilities, WMIH has approximately $600 million in cash and cash equivalents and federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $6.0 billion that are not subject to any annual use limitation and will not begin to expire until 2032. WMIH’s shareholders include a number of institutional investors, the largest of which is KKR."
Two law firms are looking into why this deal was passed up in favor of NationStar and Softbank deal:https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trillionaire-talks-wmih-banner-corp-umpqua-triple-merger-gabor/
"Been here forever, .. went through all the gyrations and manipulations. But am perfectly comfortable to wait a few more years as WMIH becomes a monster in their industry. Roll-ups backed by deep pockets will rock WMIH for the next few years...My bet is, next acquisition maybe 9 months to a year away to double the size of the company unless it's just a ""strategic move""..Those NOL's will become ""Merger Bait"". To the stars !"
Randall you must be obsessed with toys are us as that is all you seem to know. If IF WMIH is in such trouble how can the get approval for a 2.7 BILLION loan which already has several backers including CITI
COOP $21+ in two weeks
Anyone who knows anything about the financial world would recognize the two HEAVY HITTERS now in WMIH==Steve Cohen & Larry Fink
I told you so...merger campaign now in yearly plans going forward. Second acquisition:Every acquisition will wind up revenue and profit positive..via NOL's and reducing redundant operational costs..

"Wow,another impressive day:only 5% down.??Jay deserves a raise.Let's give him 40 million a year:he is worth it:SP down 50% in 6 months.lol"
.60s by end of week. Throw all the theories out the window. Wmih is a Nol play. Nol will have less value at 21% plus there are other tid bits about the NOL in the tax plan. Look it up. Management drug there feet for yrs now the thing there selling isn’t as valuable hence the stock price at .70. Many Uber bullish have blinders on because they’re in love with wmih.
"Let me get this straight. Lower mortgage rates should result in more mortgage origniation volume and revenue in the next quarter, but should cause a negative Mark to Market on the servicing contracts. From year end the ten year treasury rate has decreased from 1.88% to 1,15% and the thirty year mortgage rate is down from 3.65 to 3.23%. That decline suggests a Mark to Market of between $250 - $300 million if interest rates do not recover by the end of the first quarter. It is highly unlikely origination revenue and profit could surpass the upcoming negative mark. If the Federal Reserve lowers the discount rate in response to the virus, interest rates fall further."
"I was looking at COOP in IBD on Aug 03. - COOP hit 16 $ that day. We are still in September, and it is over $21. Wow...."
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT JUST LOW VOL COOP HAS BV OF $33.70NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME COOP WILL BE AT $50 AND BV AT $40
"M= If you got escrow you have to hold because you cannot sell, & if you do any future distributions you will lose. If you go to NASDAQ/COOP you will find there are 211 Institutional holders up 70 from WMIH"
"The only thing that Mr. Cooper has going for it is the refinance boom, which is seriously slowing right now. I own a small mortgage company, and the banks are absolutely tightening lending standards. It's no joke. Also the #$%$ Fannie/Freddie adverse market fee of 50 basis points is being implemented by all lenders now, and that has had a major effect on pricing and rates. WAY too much risk in this company right now with the share price at this level."
"Major opportunity...yes, things going forward may be difficult, but when you have a huge amount of NOL's and have competitors that don't, one can smell mergers in the air with other mortgage companies that need to preserve their capital and sow a profit, no matter how meager and that's where COOP is perfectly positioned to do ""roll ups"" of competitors..Using their back room facilities they can save on the redundant operations and personnel, squeeze out some additional profit and stay afloat. Those NOL's can sure come in handy during an upturn as well as a downturn. COOP can become a monster biz in short order."

Some movement on Wamu escrow with cash payout. Anyone know what is going on?
"Happy Holidays to all, Health & family BLESSINGS!"
"They said the price would drop before Nov 6 court hearing, No news to prop up. All COOP needs is more exposure, especially when GOOGLE refers to it as a tire Co. Now if you Google WMIH/Coop it is a different story. I will not worry as long as the 214 Institutional holders are on board along with KKR & Fortress who own 68 Million sharesg"
R= Has the merger settled yet & WMIH get to service NSM's large pro folio of mortgages? Looks like to me someone likes the merger as price is up 3.
Why does this stock stink so much? Just seems to slowly drift down every day. Seems like it has nowhere to go.

"The zombie WMIH (WAMU) escrow shares are still there! What a sham by WAMU Equity Committee, board and litigation trust members who touted potential payments from JPM-FDIC."
I’ve noticed since I️ was right above the NOLs still on the books and escrow meaning nothing to wmih common and many other things that z man contradicts me on. Now z man will not answer the tough questions.
OT. Has anyone renewed or reviewed the Vegas party plan? Just who is in charge now?
Earnings should be out in a couple of days. I'm expecting mostly good news.
What do WMIH shareholders receive in the merger?
