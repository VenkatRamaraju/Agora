"Skylight Health Group dipping down 5.36% providing a solid buying opportunity here at the low $1.00 range. They continue to acquire clinics that will help generate more revenues for $SHG and will further increase the network of clinics they are creating across the US. When $SHG closes all of the acquisitions in the $100M pipeline they forecast annual revenues to reach $56M+. With a client roster of over 155,000 patients and operations spanning 16 states with dozens of clinics, $SHG has greatly benefited over the past year with the share price rising over 1400%. The short-term consolidation is natural for a stock that has had a massive run-up in a short amount of time, $SHG is a long-term hold as they continue to strategically acquire many more medical clinics across the US. I’ll be adding more shares at these levels."
