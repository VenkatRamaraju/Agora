"the reason for drop in price may have to do with the hepc drug was left out of one insurance company formulary. In conference call company brushed off that concern indicating that 60% of revenes were from outside US, and revenue would be increasing regardless. I am relying on my memory of conference call, so look it up for yourself as my memory isn't the greatest. the transcript of conference call are here on yahoo site."

"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"

I have been loading up on ENTA during this drop. The HBV data for EDP-514 was quite impressive and was far better than the data from VIR's HBV drugs. ENTA's HBV RNA destabilizer is finally entering EDP-721 phase I safety trials but the pre-clinical data was also quite impressive.

What’s the news here? Why the 17% price drop?
This stock should be at $30-$35 per share.
"$ENTA Investors are showing interest in the company because of its strong product pipeline. On the other hand, few bearish investors feel that the stock is overvalued now. Last quarter’s revenue rose 392% to $44.05 million and earnings per share came at $0.97 compared to -$0.44 for the same period last year. https://www.finstead.com/bite/Enanta-ENTA-earnings-forecast-prediction-November-24-2018"

"Make sure to grab some nflx puts, Trump says market will crash if he's impeached, it's true.Netflix has to drop a lot. Don't be fooled by the games at first.52 week low for grub almost uber lyft also, one on the way for nflxADVM biotech price mismatch, Sector rotation back into biotech small and mid cap is real, so grabbed ADVM SRNEADVM is experiencing a price mismatch, Editas would not partner with just any biotech but did ADVERUM.moved into SRNE more and ADVM, and added to my NFLX puts, the market sure looks ugly while being so close to all-time highs. One thing is real and certain though. Value in biotech and the rotation into it. And bynd will cross 200 as will ZM cross 100uber and grub seeing door dash come on strong as of late. Even oil and retail are no match for the inflows going back into biotech everyday. It's true."

Incompetent can't manage a conference call that can be audible. Speak to the microphone
The NASH effort at ENTA ought to be worth something more to the current market cap given the purchase price of TBRA.
"There appears to be a glass ceiling at around 40 $/sh for ENTA. When it breaks, and it will, look out above!"
