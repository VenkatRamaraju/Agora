One thing is real and certain though. Value in biotech and the rotation into it. And bynd will cross 200 as will ZM cross 100uber and grub seeing door dash come on strong as of late. Even oil and retail are no match for the inflows going back into biotech everyday. It's true."

"the reason for drop in price may have to do with the hepc drug was left out of one insurance company formulary. In conference call company brushed off that concern indicating that 60% of revenes were from outside US, and revenue would be increasing regardless.

I have been loading up on ENTA during this drop. The HBV data for EDP-514 was quite impressive and was far better than the data from VIR's HBV drugs. ENTA's HBV RNA destabilizer is finally entering EDP-721 phase I safety trials but the pre-clinical data was also quite impressive.

"$tbph 35% drop yest was def overdone & is clear buying opportunity. So one drug failed, but its royalties from two COPD drugs alone value its stock at $11. Plus add ampreloxetine potential. Price target was cut by 21% which is accurate so the 35% drop puts it at 14% undervalued. After the 21% cut, price target now $29 which is still a 213% upside. https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-theravance-crashes-after-ulcerative-colitis-drug-flops/?src=A00220 $rvnc $inva $enta $xlrn"
