"$HLBZ Wow partnerships with $FOX now $AMZN. Who is going to be next. Their leadership group is A1. This will touch $60 maybe $70 in the short term and stay above that for the long. Do not listen to the shorts, they are trying to steal your shares. This is fire "
"For the last two years, Fox News is bending over to the WOKE side. It’s certainly a shame.Now their new weather channel will be the same.I very rarely watch Fox News anymore and I use to watch it all the time.Chris Wallace is a perfect example of Wokeism along with Neil Cavuto. They should both leave the station.When I do watch Fox, the only shows I watch are Tucker Carlson, Shan Hannity, and Laura Ingraham. I have switched sides to the NewsMax channel."
Great day for this stock.
"Does anyone have insight as to what may be spirring on FOX share price? I know FOX is now past the 2 year point of the Disney deal (time flies!) so they are free for mergers/divestitures, etc....Perhaps the Disney deal was Part 1 of a 2-act play? Thoughts appreciated."
Can't say anything positive here Censored.
now im stock with this one
"So much emotion in the comments. Which will equate to poor investment choices. A very simplistic view, Fox has the highest viewer base of any competitor, and has historically and consistently outperformed ratings of its competitors over the years. In terms of ratings and ad revenue generated from viewership, Fox is the winner in its industry. In terms of investment, these are some questions I have :-will Fox be able to beat revenues and produce strong EPS each quarter ?-what’s the outlook on how the public consume their news? What is the trend and how will this affect ad revenues-how would the death of Murdoch impact stock price/future of the business"
I BOUGHT THE WRONG STOCK
This stock goes nowhere.
