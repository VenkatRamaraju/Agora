"While it appears as ""one person reacting"" keeps coming up, anyone notice it odd there are no comments for several days on this board? Why is that??"
"FOX the most decent stock in media. We are demanding the FBI tell us if all of the children on the Hunter Biden laptop have been accounted for. We must know this. The FBI has had this laptop ""FOR OVER A YEAR"" In the Jeffrey Epstein case we repeatedly warn the FBI that once they arrested Epstein it was imperative that they guard his jail cell, we explicitly told them Epstein will kill himself and the chance at rescuing some children would be lost. Well, we know what happened. The FBI held a conference after he killed himself and children likely disappeared forever. This not some political game, has the FBI accounted for all the children they have found on Hunter Biden's laptop! Has the FBI even made effort to account for the children on Hunter Biden's laptop.People, the FBI is a farce and a 6 billion dollar waste of money. If you audit them you will find out how little they accomplish for the mind numbing amount of money we spend on them. They cared more about protecting Joe Biden then accounting for the children on the laptop. Hunter should have been arrested immediately and the accounting of the children should have been the highest priority.FOX is the only decent people in this cesspool of media."

Voting technology company Smartmatic files $2.7-billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News
"Strong FOX stock. Bret Baier has just made the case for the Class Action Lawsuit against the democratic pollsters. Baier did an incredible job asking the questions of his well sourced guests - why were the democratic polls so wrong. His well sourced guests mumbled about this being Trump/GOP voters. Huh? These guests know it was fraud and they could not admit it, from fear of reprisal. These guests know that the dem pollsters were running the same polls we were running and GETTING the same result - BLM Rioters and Defund Police was having a dramatic affect. Which is why the Democratic pollsters cooked the polls and engaged in election fraud. They were wokring to ""sell America"" that the Country was behind the radical left. These rotten marther farkers abused the American people to disguise the truth and to create the phony narrative. The dem pollsters knew that with a 50/50 race democrats would have to go on Sunday News Shows and everywhere else and defend what was happening with the fire bomb/riot/murders. Democrats would have to TALK about the BLM Rioters and Defund Police before the election, not after it, as they are now doing. The dem pollsters KNEW their polls were junk, which the msmedia used to abuse GOP candidates and spokespersons by saying to them...look polls are showing you guys down 9 POINTS what do you say to that. My security is engaged in a Cartagena knife fight inside China, we cannot bring the Class Action Lawsuit. The law firm that does bring this C.A.L. will receive from Fed Ex mind numbing anonymous support for the case. God Bless Bret Baier...great job."

"FOX is family wholesome, stock should display that. The FBI is about to learn a harsh lesson, you DO NOT get to frame Mike Flynn. Tony Bobulinksi has spoken, maybe the great agents that saved Michigan from being overthrown by some kids in a garage will pick up Tony's phones and proceed to put the Bidens in prison. The FBI is mostly bravado in their world of make believe, they are in over their head - welcome to the real world we operate in. I have a picture of Comey in Westport, har har har... in fact my career started in Westport with a Tax Shelter Company, go figure.FOX is family of Patriots, stock will go higher.FOX is best in class."
"If the lawsuits by Dominion and Smartmatic succeed... Fox is worth less than half from before. Shareholders will get wiped out and since CNN lost a lawsuit to some kid for less, I doubt Fox has much of a chance."
Goodbye fox hello newsmax
Sad!
"FOX stock. The FBI deliberately fought against the Tucker Carlson/Tony Bobulinski interview for the FBI leadership knew it would prove to the line agents that the leadership is corrupt. And an arm of the democratic party. Everyone thinks it is sooo unconceivable the FBI could be corrupt - the reality for most private security around the world is that we know how easily it can be done. Who monitors the leadership of the FBI? No one, they are free to take money from big democratic donors and join right into the election fraud. There is NOT one FBI whistle blower that will come forward when they know that the msmedia is bought and paid for by the same people paying off the leadership. Comey was well paid for the FBI ""russian collusion farce."" People DO NOT realize that the FBI leadership has NO OVERSIGHT which has corrupted them, allowing them to slow walk the Biden investigation to give Biden time to frame Bobulinski. Bobulinski came forward and NOT one peep from the msmedia. Line agents know the election was full of ballot fraud and that the msmedia is a dem operative organization. One that will protect a corrupt FBI leadership. Tell Romney to shut his mouth and let this play out, an FBI insider might come forward and tell the truth about what happened to the Biden ""victorious"" count. We are telling you, the FBI IGNORED serious ballot irregularities."

"It's interesting that the class A shares (non voting shares, lower dividend) are worth more than the B shares. My only guess is that people are used to the A shares usually being worth more for other stocks."
Bought in today. Analysts optimistic across the board.. not sure why this is at/near 52 week lows.
Fox is down 5.44% to 36.33
Still awaiting cost bases. I did receive both New Fox shares and Disney shares. The number of shares received for both securities was about equal in # of shares. Not concerned with either FOXA or FOXAV no longer issues juan.

"FOX stock is best. We are hearing from one of our informants deep inside the FBI that ""leadership"" deliberately slow walked the investigation into the Bidens. The Delaware laptop may be a mish mash of data and ""leadership"" wanted to make it ""russian interference"" and the line agents were suggesting it was Joe Biden himself. Line agents are telling us there are all these (hunter) laptops because Joe told a democratic operative to put them out there. Also, was Jim Biden going to foreign country's with phony security who were pretending to be secret service with Jim acting as if Vice President Joe Biden. These were small wealthy business gathering where the person holding the meeting needed American cache' - and for a cash payment Jim Biden would show up and give a talk as VP Biden. Did Jim Biden ever tell a foreign intelligence person he could get data for a price? This is so outrageous. The so called russian disinformation was a Joe Biden democratic operative hiding behind the russian vote thief hysteria. All of these Hunter laptops out there? and blame it on Russia."

Can't say anything positive here Censored.
"FOX stock. This is where the ""constitutional"" argument and the rubber meets the road. Dominion TOLD swing states, and we have Eric Croomer on tape stating it as FACT - the only mitigation to an illegal ballot and improper count is to aggressively AUDIT the ""mail in"" ballot BEFORE you put that vote into the machine. Swing state big city's did NOT do that, they blocked off observers and never audited - they simply stuffed them into the Dominion. Dominion knows their machines are UNSTABLE. My security firm bought these Dominion machines last year on EBAY and hacked them, we also purchased new ones black market in a foreign country. We are asking DHS why you can buy these machines on Ebay, and did DHS ever try to hack these machines. The masterminds at DHS must know, and what are they hiding. The AUDIT is required per Dominion to take place before the count and that NEVER happened. Swing state accomplice knew that without audit, and without an observer the count for Biden would jump substantially. That is unconstitutional!"

"Terrible, horrific, beyond repair... It looks like consensus here that FOX either is not going to survive this lawsuit or at least it will be seriously damaged -- to the tune of 40%-60%. Should I short it?"
Advertising $$$ is down by at least 20-25% - Tucker Carlson and Ingraham programs are bleeding money by over 50%...short this...
So we had pretty solid earnings and beat expectations.... why arent we moving after hours? Is this thing going to tank tomorrow after an earnings beat??

Tucker the best news on TV.
CNN ABC CBS NBC should NOT get any money from the REPUBLICAN PARTY spend any money on FOX
well they may be selling soap but I and many others will boycott their products .
"FOXA is the ""new"" FOX with the Disney acquired assets removed. FOXA is worth about 1/3 what it was before. the 2/3 you lost should now be in your account as DIS shares. FOXA is non voting stock. FOXB is the voting shares controlled by the Murdoch family. FOXA includes FOX cable news, business news, local FOX stations, FOX sports network and the land in Century City that was the movie studio property. What will FOX do with that valuable land? I'm holding on to my FOXA, may buy some more."
Well former Speaker Boehner sure has some great things to say about the management of FOX News. He's completely correct. FOX is destroying itself. Destroying the marketplace of ideas. Destroying the Republican Party. And even destroying what once was a cash cow for investors. And that is why it is a lousy investment. I might need to buy more Nexstar when the markets open on Monday. They are doing real news over there.

"Even though with good peer review data, there is no movement in the stock price today  This will be much focused only if they announce the $$$ amount for P2 and P3 funding from DOD. Ones done they need to act quick with P2 and start P3 immediately crossing all the hurdles. Also we are lack of publicity here, no news on national TV’s CNBC, CBS, FOX, CNN. See how much hype they created for PFE, NVAX, MODERNA and AZA with Peer review data. One more thing is, people are thinking that we are behind, but the answer is NO. Best example is SNF, they didn’t even start P1 with TBIO partnership and CEO said on Madmoney that this is not a race to run and deliver the best, SNF is the world leader for vaccines with 100+ years of experience. They know that this virus will live forever and moreover a new strains will be coming every now and then which needs to be taken care. Bottom line, world should know about INO #CNBC, #CBS, #FOX, #CNN."
"So much emotion in the comments. Which will equate to poor investment choices. A very simplistic view, Fox has the highest viewer base of any competitor, and has historically and consistently outperformed ratings of its competitors over the years. In terms of ratings and ad revenue generated from viewership, Fox is the winner in its industry. In terms of investment, these are some questions I have :-will Fox be able to beat revenues and produce strong EPS each quarter ?-what’s the outlook on how the public consume their news? What is the trend and how will this affect ad revenues-how would the death of Murdoch impact stock price/future of the business"
"Since 3:45 yesterday FOXA has over 880,000 shares of buys and only 143,000 shares of sells. Momentum building towards the conventions, NFL, and elections."

Why did this stock tank today
There is no floor to this thing.
"FOX has strongest balance sheet. Pay close attention to the recent FBI arrests of the 5 people charged with Chinese threatening/intimidation. The Showboat just might have a lower deck of brilliant agents. These arrest are HUGE, and a great victory for the US. These arrests are what we call ""tail of the tiger"" arrests, the FBI broke up a Chinese Cell and likely learned important information. I encourage FOX to make hay of it. I encourage Americans to twitter up thank you FBI. Please, do not let this go without applause; applause helps our agents to have informants come forward which has a damaging effect on Chinese spying operations. Three cheers for FBI lower deck..."
Trying to be logical how can anyone be President who ran on higher taxes defunding our fine police going after big oil stopping fracking not campaigning and still win? could it be because the other media outside of Fox news gave him a pass?

"Just got me 15,000 shares of FOXA at $24.80 thank you thank you !! Folks they did very well despite the lower ad revenues due to the Coronavirus. They beat in the bottom line and practically match on gross sales. You need to think that these two coming quarters will be very good, they will have added as revenues from traditional companies, presidential ads & debates will increase the cost of the ads. Also sports will be back, college football  and the NFL. “Mr. Murdoch said that he remains confident that the coming quarters will be very strong”. Folks what more can we ask for and they are not affected by the China trade deal nor many other economic factors !! This has to be the safest stock in the market now. Fox News is the source where both parties tune in to get a fair and balanced news without a spin. They also have the highest ratings of all the news channels. I am predicting that FOXA is going back to $35 by the end of the year due to a strong showing in the next two quarters. One more thing... they have the prettiest news women in the business.  Good luck to all the longs... you will make money  with this company. !!"

"FOX stock strong. It is disturbing, DHS has become an enabling scam artist just like the Dem pollsters that had Biden up 7,8,9 points in swing states. We want DHS to walk to the mic and tell America that they are 100% certain that a hack of Dominion did not take place, and that they know exactly how many illegal votes have been cast. Texas has told us that Dominion is UNSTABLE, they have gone on the record. There is no doubt that hackers and illegal ballots look for ""accomplice zones,"" and these accomplice zones were in Philly, Detroit, Atlanta, Phoenix, and Nevada. Dominion themselves has stated that the only security to a hack and illegal ballots was for the ""election commissioner"" to run an aggressive AUDIT... Here is Dr. Eric Coomer from Dominion, who is an Antifa supporter, stating that the only security MITIGATION strategy is a ROBUST AUDIT of the votes and the machines. Go to the 7:30 mark of the included youtube video and watch Coomer talk. The ""accomplice zones"" have no interest in an aggressive audit, the race is way too close. We demand that DHS step to the mic and tell us if Dominion's Coomer is right, that a robust AUDIT is the only way to fairly determine an election.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbCmq0jPUxY"
"Wednesday cable ratings: Tucker down to #3, Hannity to #9 and Laura to #18. Only 3 in the top 20.This downward trend will continue."
I think the tax returns once released will show who he was in bed with … after all he did promise to release his taxes during the race… more than 4 years later still not returns … should be fun
Tucker Carlson the best thing on T.V.
I don’t get why this stock keeps going down as much or more than the market. Am I missing something? I would think more people would be watching fox when their not going out because of coronavirus.
Going to 39.
I’m no expert but that seems like a good earnings report and outlook. Maybe I’m missing something but it seems better than recent speculations.
Fox the only news i follow. Just curious i noticed today that your reporters are saying that there is no proof of fraud. Than why is Lou Dobbs Tucker Hannity ingrams producing evidence to the contrary? examples you have shown are testimony by Sidney Powell of widespread voter fraud with the Dominion software which is outside of the United states software and its owners rigged elections outside of the U.S.A. Again Fox has shown observers not being allowed to watch the ballots being counted and being kicked out in some places like Detroit who also boarded up their windows. Fox showed key swing states closing down at the same time and when they reopened trump big leads were gone. Fox has shown on Lou Dobbs how 100's of people have signed affidavits claiming voter fraud in many key swing states. Fox has shown how that software was rejected by Texas as being easy to hack and to change vote. So my questions to Fox are how much evidence do you need?? and why are you backing off now and saying no evidence. i hope that i am wrong but it seems as if you are intimidated by the Democratic party. Lets hope not. Pelosi said in 2005 that all legal votes should be counted. So why not now?
Nice segment by Tucker. He simply asked Sidney Powell where's the proof (repeatedly) of electronic voter fraud. None has been provided.
Short all you can at the open. This is heading towards the pink sheets !!!!!!
Why is the stock down 5%?
FOX won’t survive the Dominion suit. Amazing to see fortunes lost and reputations permanently scarred all for some orange non-billionaire has-been.
Now the Florida self proclaimed demigod desantis is telling school boards what they can teach and can’t teach. When will he order book burning?

"I have no position on FOX but I was just told by a trader friend that he is heavy into Fox that with the Fox Sports, NFL and College football , presidential adds & debates, increase in adds is a certain that next quarter and 4th Quarter will be very strong. Murdoch is very confident that this coming quarter will be strong. Folks this looks like a great entry point to buy and hold Fox Corp. After reading the commentaries from Murdoch and the CEO I feel very confident this is a great opportunity to buy. This is a $40 stock anyway you put it “PERIOD”"

They need to pay us a dividend again. FOX wake up.

"$HLBZ Wow partnerships with $FOX now $AMZN. Who is going to be next. Their leadership group is A1. This will touch $60 maybe $70 in the short term and stay above that for the long. Do not listen to the shorts, they are trying to steal your shares. This is fire "
i e-mailed the White House voicing my support for President Trump. I hope that many others do the same. We must stand united. The freedom imo of America is at stake.
"Does anyone have insight as to what may be spirring on FOX share price? I know FOX is now past the 2 year point of the Disney deal (time flies!) so they are free for mergers/divestitures, etc....Perhaps the Disney deal was Part 1 of a 2-act play? Thoughts appreciated."
Great day for this stock.
"FOX has premium balance sheet to match its news. The Nation should be concerned...Regarding the Hunter Biden pictures what our team finds most disturbing is the picture of Hunter with a crack pipe. Not so much for the drug addict Hunter Biden, which is terrifying enough, but for the symbolism of that picture. We will state with certainty that Joe Biden has a Ukrainian grandson and the Biden's will pay well over 100k a month to keep that fact from the American people. And there is a good chance that the US is at risk from the Hunter/Joe Biden escapade. The nation needs to know does Joe Biden have a Ukrainian grandson.We have been international operators for years, the crack pipe is international extortion symbolism. Joe Biden has ""family"" in Ukraine. We hope it is only one grandson that Joe Biden has. Now we know why Kamala Venezuela Harris is meeting with very high ranking California FBI. It will take nothing to bounce Slow Joe from office and make her President. Does Kamala Harris know that Joe Biden has a Ukrainian grandson. Did she receive a cryptic letter ""Welcome to the Ukrainian family vice president Biden."" Doe she know Joe Biden is being extorted?Finally, if the FBI master manipulators can save Michigan from being overthrown, surely they can tell us if this is Hunter Biden's lap top hard drive. We do not care where it came from and whether it is a copy or not. This is a simple yes or no for the FBI political operators, is this Hunter Biden's hard drive. If it is, extortion of Joe Biden has begun. The FBI is despicable, they know this information is authentic..."

"FOX stock strong. Readers and everyone should be aware that Yahoo/Verizon have begun to CENSOR posts regarding the fraud during this election cycle. They are removing my post that prove voter fraud. And reading terms of service, these post have everything to do with FOX stock price since FOX is the only network covering the fraud allegations."
now im stock with this one
I would like to buy into fox but it seems like the stock is continually on a down trend even with strong financial reports. Maybe it was overvalued at the start or maybe I am missing something. This could be one to watch. You can’t go wrong making money as my accounting professor would say. So why is fox doing poorly?
"Wow, even a stock buyback can't prop up this dog."

"J & J (& anyone else): 1. Why do you think they took all the conversation threads down?2. Does anyone know who to research corp stock buybacks (ie. day by day)?Share price behavior before, during, and after the 15 days where the avg was apparently taken, seems peculiar (being generous with my terminology). This should be an easy thing to verify, once we know where to go."
"FOX stock strong. Looks like the vote ""cheater"" in Detroit just got ""woke"" we are hearing the next 7 days until state tries to certify gives lawyers time to go over the fraud in Detroit. Detroit just got WOKE."
"Many seem to make the claim that a recount, while finding ballots that weren't filled out correctly by DNC staffers might get tossed, they still won't close the gap that Biden supposedly has over Trump. That might be true.But the real test isn't that. These thousands of claims of voter fraud are being reviewed at this time. If systemic is proven but no remedy is given by the SCOTUS, it goes back to the House to determine the winner. The SCOTUS has already chimed in on Pennsylvania so they are going to get involved.Here's where it get fun.Each state gets one vote per state.And the GOP has more state legislators and governors in the House. I believe the number is 34.Guess what happens then?"
how does this still trade if Disney owns? would love some clarification.
"Have you noticed the massive drop in viewership at Fox?Tucker barely made the top 20.It's a holiday weekend and the new numbers don't drop until Monday, but I'd be willing to bet they aren't good.The takedown of Fox will continue.Maybe some of the MSNBC or CNN crowd can start watching it?I know I won't."
"Fox has best management team. We are inside China. Joe Biden with onset dementia is no joke, Kamala Harris is a pawn of the radical left. We know for a fact that China has another bioweapon virus and they will force Venezuela to do as they want. Biden standing at Gettysburg with no mention of the FBI framing the Russian Collusion and then framing Mike Flynn displayed Biden as a Gettysburg stunt. No one and I mean no one from Gettysburg would have tolerated an egregious act of espionage. Ask Biden if Union soldier families get ""reparations."" China has another Bioweapon virus, Biden has onset dementia, nobody wanted to vote for Harris because they don't trust her. And one thing is abundantly clear - China fears Donald Trump...Vote your conscience. Covid19 was a Gymnasium virus. China did not make the virus, they discovered the right virus after years and years of intense research. The Gymnasium's virus participants are treated as National Heroes. Covid19 was released by the Chinese Military behind Xi's back...FOX is having a great year."
"Pro football + gambling = higher ratings & revenue, stock value"
"FOX stock has a base building. FOR A WHOLE YEAR Tony Bobulinski was the only person that could tell the FBI if Hunter was working Joe Biden - and THE FBI NEVER TALKED TO HIM. Tony Bobulinski realized the FBI was about to frame him the same way they framed Mike Flynn. Why did Bobulinski have to come forward, why did the FBI not contact him????Ask the FBI if all the children on Hunter Bidens laptop are accounted for. Why has Hunter Biden not been arrested."
"FOX stock strong. The democratic party has used the Chinese Military pandemic to instill hatred and fraud into American politics - to please China tech China and to grab the Presidency in rescue of China. People need to realize how close Donald Trump was to altering the Capitalistic Communists. Just think about that ""Capitalistic Communists."" Once China knew the FBI had done the unthinkable and the impeachment was a farce they realized Donald Trump had a quite strong economy and the wherewithal to take tariffs and move them to sanctions with a second term; sanctioning corrupt Chinese capitalists. What China feared most was from within, China feared their own tech company's. Hong Kong was unravelling, Taiwan was about to buy weapons, China has major pollution issues, lack of stable energy, swine flu as a regular occurrence alongside the human organ harvesting and slave labor that was about to be exposed. Here is the most IMPORTANT facet, Chinese tech was starting to stray from Communist control. We are deep inside China from a 4 decade operation. The CIA/FBI are clueless - China realized that Hong Kong protests were coming from a military faction and from some of the leaders of Chinese Tech. Hong Kong was a lynch pin and Donald Trump had to go. The most treasonous event in American History was Joe Biden whispering to China that the Mueller Investigation was ""his team."" Chinese Military released the Virus behind Xi Jinpings back. CIA/FBI have no idea what really happened inside China during China's lockdown, and how important that China lock down was to them.Grandpa Biden is owned by Xi Jinping. Democrats stole an election."
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN and VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS are the best since OBAMA/BIDEN
so fox you deleted my post ok I won't turn on any fox networks again .
Outside of a few FOX commentators the network has turned radically left. No longer does it hold the number 1 spot and it will crater even further since many conservatives are turning elsewhere for commentaries.

"If Fox was going to begin trading so soon, it should have begun at a higher price. The company's overall valuation indicates this. Analysts low-ball a company after making such a move as Fox. The company obviously has a greater detail."
Is Sean Hannity bragging about all the guns he owns again? Happens every time there is a mass murder event.
"Disney: Playing The Game To Win https://seekingalpha.com/article/4184796?source=ansh $DIS, $CMCSA, $FOX, $FOXA"
"Everyone, say it together......BIDEN WINS!"
Now in regards to proof of any fraud on a possible scale as large as this it takes time does it not to gather the evidence and interview many witnesses of fraud to make a strong case does it not? i thank God for Fox news.
Yahoo finance where i have been on for over 20yrs what you are doing is so wrong! i see people on other boards wishing Trump dead without being censored! and i get censored for trying to be honest.
The best network out there.
"Have you looked at the ratings for the prior week?Tucker still on top, but everyone else at Fox has taken a tumble.Good news, everyone!"
Why the disparity between FOXA & FOX? It is usually only a very small delta reflecting voting rights & relative liquidity ?
Excellent balance sheet and earnings power. If you want to talk about a brand that has loyal users look no further. All the posts talking politics are letting their emotions guide their investment decisions.
"Will they actually attempt to protect their asset? Tucker Carlson just hinted, maybe, but the Squealers in the news division act otherwise."
"Disney, Fox shareholders approve $71B asset deal https://seekingalpha.com/news/3374992?source=ansh $FOX, $FOXA, $DIS"
"Bloomberg: Concession makes Disney/Fox deal ready for Brazil OK https://seekingalpha.com/news/3437332?source=ansh $FOX, $FOXA, $DIS"
"Tucker down to #5 in overnight ratings. Hannity was #10 and Laura was #17.Going down, going down, down!"
Whole market is booming and were down 5% on a double beat
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"When the results of the 2020 election audits are released and were they to reveal massive voter fraud which would change the results of the 2020 election, how do you think $FOX stock price will be effected if at all...???"
Fox has started the purge. and it is just the start. The network is toast

"@juan. Things have reverted back to how they were prior to the merger (ie. the more things change, the more they stay the same : ). ie. OLD FOX had FOX and FOXA shares. NEW FOX also has FOX and FOXA shares. The difference between the two has already been discussed (A shares vs B shares.....voting rights, etc). So just think of things as having gone back to how they were. FOXAV as just a placeholder ticker during the transition. Hope that helps."
Dear Leader thanks you for your assistance with State Run Television.

For company that makes a ton of money its amazing how all it does is tank every day
Happy to take the Disney stock option instead of cash.

Trump is gonna have a hard time paying off that “$400 million “ debt he’s in.. I guess he can become a ... he can pay he debt by next year...
I just saw Juan Williams is leaving the five. I couldn't stand him and stopped watching the five. Now maybe I can watch it again.
"We never watch FoxNews because of the lies that they spread every day, every year supporting Dictator Trump!Democracy prevailed and Joe Biden has won to be our next president. There were no fraudulent actions during the voting and counting of the ballots. (Single voter irregularities in small numbers can occur in all states, but get corrected). We should be very grateful for the election workers and volunteers for having allowed our Democracy to make the voice of the American People heard.We need Republicans and Democrats to unite and make sure Trump will concede to Biden and work with Biden for a productive transition of power for the sake of our country's well being and safety."
Liberal bias Shepard Smith go find a job at MSNBC or CNN fake news you’ll fit in perfect.
Chris Wallace should not be on fox network he is a Democrat never watch his show
"FOX stock strong. Quite shocking how confused DHS truly is. Texas has told us that Dominion is unsecure, hackable, and an UNSTABLE platform to cast and count votes. Yet our heroes from DHS are saying there is no evidence? of the UNSTABLE platform performing to imperfect status. DHS has absolutely no way of knowing if these machines have suffered a massive hack as some/many are suggesting. We have been inside China for 4 decades within the realm of ""code."" The election system during this election had more EXPOSURE than ever before in our history. Furthermore a ""code line"" looks for situations of willing accomplice. Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, Phoenix, Nevada are all what we call corruption zones of willing accomplice. These area of voters would pride themselves to assist in electing Biden. We take Texas word for it, and for good reason. The Country has an UNSTABLE platform with ballots mailed out like pizza coupons, so much so Courts have rule the mailing and changes violated the law, all these ballots going into ""accomplice"" zones where they brag about helping to defeat Trump. And the heroes at DHS are saying nothing happened, when the DHS has NO IDEA if a hack took place. We certainly know scores of illegal ballots were counted. Can the master minds of DHS tell us how may illegal ballots are counted every election. That is the point, they have NO IDEA how many illegal ballots are counted during an election, yet everyone screams out - its not enough to change the results. Think about it, they have no idea but it is not enough. Sounds like China talk. Got news for you, and this comes from some of the best code inside CHINA. DHS should shut up and start pulling Dominion machines and checking them...3 elements just discussed, good chance a massive hack occurred. An UNSTABE platform with massive exposure through a ballot tsunami sent into accomplice zones!"
Kamala 1st African Asian women to be elected Vice President of the United States of America

So how can we be tanking padt 52wk lows and not even having a news article giving an explanation? Is it normal for a stock to tank 10% for no reason?
"CEO of FOX L. Murdoch bought 102,000 shares ($2,873,000) at $28.29 on June 15. It is $28.11 now so it must be a good value and it is down 23.6% YTD. Today at the close the 3 biggest buys of the session totaled $327.21K shares at an average price of $28.09."
why did this drop 15 points?
What is the difference Btwn FOX & FOXA
FOX news coverage on the Coronavirus has proven to be much better than the competitors. Truly balanced. I suspect viewership has increased SHARPLY.
"Denver-based technology company Dominion Voting Systems has filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, arguing that the network falsely claimed that the company had rigged the 2020 presidential election in order to boost its ratings."
