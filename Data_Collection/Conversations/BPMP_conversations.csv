Assume everyone saw the 8k filing last week regarding financial impact of Hurricane Ida..
"On Aug 06, JPM downgraded BPMP to ‘sell’ with a price target of $14; can someone who has access to the research please post the gist of the analyst’s logicBecause if there is a BP buyout announced based on which the price target is reset to $14, it is still a decent return in the near term, so I am curious how the analyst is supporting a ‘sell’ rating"
"BP received 17.58 four years ago when it went public, why should it be worth less now?"
More info by next friday including Dist.declaration imo.
"Getting back in under 12.90. With dividend to capture this quarter and limited IMO downside risk with some upside, remains to be seen how much, will 13.01 deal hold or increase? Not a bad option in the current market."
No news on this company forever!
Distribution declaration Friday.Hope we get one more before the buyout closes..
Volume has been very low the last couple sessions.. I guess people are holding and waiting to see if we get a better offer?
"Distribution of $.3475 declared, no mention of BP offer."
Investors paying $0.40 for the May 15 calls are certainly looking for a better offer or the current offer going away..
Expect $14.25 plus distribution.Close by year end.
"Thanks, all. I am very familiar and hold shares in BPMP and EPD. Not selling for now. Agree BP may terminate the mlp. Also agree with Johm, EPD is a buy, especially with the upcoming Houston Index, with MMP and possibly others."
I would be looking for $14 plus 1 more Distribution at a minimum..I think $14.50 total is in the cards...Hoping for a 2022 close. But that may be asking for too plenty..
Would not expect the conflicts committee to complete their Due Diligence until near the end of the quarter. No hurry. Hoping the final offer doesn't close until 2022
big moves on low volume.. someone knows something
"Because BP holds a majority of the units, and from the outset (of the IPO filing) has reserved the right to cause the general partner to dilute (or abdicate even) it’s fiduciary duties to minority shareholders, they seem to hold all the cards in this situationThey can try to buy out the unaffiliated partnership units cheaply, which caps the upside holders, and if it turns out that a deal is not in BP’s interest for whatever reason, they could even withdraw their ‘non binding’ offer at any time, thus opening up the downside again in the marketNow BP is a professionally run and well regarded global enterprise that has a lot to lose reputation wise, so I would expect them to do the minimum necessary to create at least the appearance of fairness, and that is all that minority investors have going for them"
X dist. Today
"Not a ""done deal"" until BP gets to an 80% ownership position or the conflicts committee agree on price...Still a possibility of a minority shareholder Vote to approve as i understand...BP has most of the leverage...but not all..!!"
does it make sense to accumulate shares as long as they are under 13.01?? that's the floor here right?
Large Thunderhorse expansion onstream..Will it make a difference to purchase price ? Will certainly increase Eps and Dcf..
"Distribution for 2021 Q2 is unchanged:BP Midstream Partners LP (“BPMP” or the “Partnership”) today announced that the Board of Directors of BP Midstream Partners GP LLC,the general partner of the Partnership, declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3475 per unit for the second quarter of 2021, consistent with the level of distribution for the first quarter 2021.The second quarter 2021 distribution will be payable on August 12, 2021, to unitholders of record as of July 29, 2021, with an ex-distribution date of July 28, 2021."
"BPMP declared another distribution increase on July 17 to .3237. Yield is 8.2% Seven quarters in a row of increases, with more to come."
"I got out at $13.16 and bought EPD at $22.23, lost about .59 cents on 3000 shares but I expect EPD to make it up and keep performing long term. Got out of SHLX at $13.56 also went to EPD. May move some more things while EPD still under $23.00. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide what to do, who knows what will happen but I already bet the ranch on EPD anyway.Best to AllJohn"
Seems like our options contracts are frozen by 13.00 stock price as BP Holdco has upper hand on holding price at 13.00 since they announced their majority interest in BPMP at time of proposal. Contracts will expire long before a reasonable offer comes on the table. This stock should trade for over 16.00 and the current situation by BP Holdco is damaging to Options Contract holders. Does anyone know what will happen to the Options contracts that are now in a lame duck situation caused by BP Holdco for likely their benefit. Am I the only one uncertain about this and frustrated? Am I missing something in my analysis?
"It would seem appropriate for there to be some news, scheduling, anticipated deadlines, etc, issues by management or simply discussed. Keeping quiet will appear more of an “inside job” in the shareholder lawsuits."
When BP offered $13.01 in BP shares stock price was $26.03basically 1/2 share.I still expect 1/2 share.Bp now much higher
"Fair value would be 18.5, anything less there will be lawsuits"
Investors at current price are receiving 10%..It is best interest of shareholders too decline any offer.I am more than happy with 10%
Almost 9 times average volume today maybe parent buying up as many shares as possible on open market
When will the company announce if they are accepting BP's offer and negotiating for a better offer. There is almost no news about this company! Too small a company for anyone to pay attention to.
Bought alot at !12.96..!1.39 distribution.10% plus.Great arbitrage.on buy out
"Reading various research pieces and commentaries, there are two paths for BP to get this done without resorting to its ‘limited call’ right— submit the final negotiated terms to the conflicts committee of BPMP and have it rule on whether BP can vote its units (which already constitute a majority)— if the conflicts committee rules in favor, then the vote becomes a formality and the deal is basically done as submitted (this is not to be confused with the $13.01 initial offer)— if the conflicts committee determines that BP cannot vote its shares (this is a low likelihood event but can happen when the CC regards the terms of the BP offer to be patently unfair to minority unit holders), then a vote will be held where only the non BP unit holders will be asked to vote, which is a longer process and will obviously involve various public communications— an altogether separate process for BP to buy out the minority unit holders is to acquire enough units, one way or another, to overcome the threshold (80%) for it to exercise its limited call right, and then call the remaining units"
"Hi all, would like to seek some opinions here.I have bought BPMP in recent months, enticed by the big dividends and attractive SP.However, recently, at Telsa battery day, I learnt that they have plans to introduce US$25k EV to compete in the market. I understand there are still multiple issues with EV, from the cost, charging time, range, lack of charging infrastructure etc.Still, as I research further, many automakers are pouring their money into EV research and more EV models are coming. Future EV models and infrastructure will improve going forward. In addition, many countries will start to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles from 2030.Also, recently, BP Energy Outlook 2020 indicated that oil demand has reached its peak.As BPMP transports curde oil, so it will be impacted severely by the decreasing oil demand. Land transportation comprises of 66% oil demand. What do you all think about BPMP's prospect in 20 years time, in 2040?Can we hold long-term which is my plan?Thanks"
Conflicts Committee should be close to a decision.Its been over a month.Perhaps negotiating. I have been involved in many Valuation analysis and Fairness opinions.It's not rocket science...Much of the Background is often done pre offer.
Any updates on the buyout offer.? If it gets accepted I’m selling most and keeping a few hundred BP shares. If not accepted I’m holding. I would like to know so I can plan ahead.
At this price it’s a guarantee profit even if the buyout is a lowball $13.01..Safest place to park money anywhere is here.
So the buyout is $14.25 or $15.50?? Can we get a final clarification?Either way I’m buying as much as I can at current price.
"This is the rough calculation for BP:— at around $3/ADR of earnings, expected for FY2021, they have an earnings yield of 12% currently— the current earnings yield on the BPMP units is around 12% as well— but the existence of the BPMP public partnership is a costly nuisance for BP as BPMP places a lot of obligations and related expense (separate arms length governance and org structure, outside auditors, lawyers, tax accountants, etc)— and finally there is information pertaining to their operations that leaks out via the BPMP disclosures (you can make educated guesses as to what one of their biggest refineries in the US is doing based on the published throughput numbers in the BPMP onshore pipelines)So when you combine all of the above, at some low unit price (say $14-15), it makes sense to terminate the public partnership, which in any case is being consolidated into BP’s financial results based on their majority ownershipSaves money, simplifies everything and keeps operational flow information confidential; what’s not to like?My guess is that they will come out with a tender price in the range of $14-15, and perhaps pay that in the form of BP ADRs (this part I don’t get, as BP just announced an ongoing share repurchase program, so why add to outstanding shares? Why not just take the BPMP units out for cash?)"
"$15.50 plus two dividend distributions, as the take under is completed in 1st Qtr 2022."
Big day today; enter the 14's.
