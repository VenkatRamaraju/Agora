"Not a ""done deal"" until BP gets to an 80% ownership position or the conflicts committee agree on price...Still a possibility of a minority shareholder Vote to approve as i understand...BP has most of the leverage...but not all..!!"
"$15.50 plus two dividend distributions, as the take under is completed in 1st Qtr 2022."
Expect $14.25 plus distribution.Close by year end.
Investors at current price are receiving 10%..It is best interest of shareholders too decline any offer.I am more than happy with 10%
So the buyout is $14.25 or $15.50?? Can we get a final clarification?Either way I’m buying as much as I can at current price.
When BP offered $13.01 in BP shares stock price was $26.03basically 1/2 share.I still expect 1/2 share.Bp now much higher
"Distribution of $.3475 declared, no mention of BP offer."
Investors paying $0.40 for the May 15 calls are certainly looking for a better offer or the current offer going away..
big moves on low volume.. someone knows something
Any updates on the buyout offer.? If it gets accepted I’m selling most and keeping a few hundred BP shares. If not accepted I’m holding. I would like to know so I can plan ahead.
No news on this company forever!
Large Thunderhorse expansion onstream..Will it make a difference to purchase price ? Will certainly increase Eps and Dcf..
Distribution declaration Friday.Hope we get one more before the buyout closes..
More info by next friday including Dist.declaration imo.
Bought alot at !12.96..!1.39 distribution.10% plus.Great arbitrage.on buy out
Conflicts Committee should be close to a decision.Its been over a month.Perhaps negotiating. I have been involved in many Valuation analysis and Fairness opinions.It's not rocket science...Much of the Background is often done pre offer.
Assume everyone saw the 8k filing last week regarding financial impact of Hurricane Ida..
"BP received 17.58 four years ago when it went public, why should it be worth less now?"
Big day today; enter the 14's.
