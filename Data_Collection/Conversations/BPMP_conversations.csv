About a million shares short out to dry...funny!
Why did BP sell $700m in pipeline assets connected to its Whiting refinery to Sixth Street and not to BPMP?! Does anyone have any insight?
I'm really considering exiting MLP's altogether as the whole group trades very poorly......yeah BPMP steady distribution increases and yet steadily down....another example would be MPLX... every quarter list. up a 1 cents but unit basically stuck in the low 30's for 3 years yet every analyst has buy.....look at HEP yielding 10% yeah I know basically no more dropdwowns from the parent.....every company seems to have issues and yet oil production and movement of product is way up....
if this ever stops falling its a steal holdingschannel
This has been a very good short term investment for me. Looking ahead the future looks good and green.
Kayne Anderson filed a 13g reporting 10+%Ownership..
W0W AN0THER Dividend Raise! H0w many does that make 0be the last 2 years?
no arbitration ..Below offer.not.great.Lets hope price spikes up..
Keeping 3q Distribution unchanged..Building cash.Maybe a raise next quarter if DCF continues to build. X date is 10/28
What a POS.........everything BP touches is a POS........ this thing has to be headed to under $10. Why did BP even bother? Lot of debt and minimal growth
BP Midstream Partners is up 5.33% to 11.47
sold 1/3 at 15.09. then another 1/3 at 15.68. Maybe it was investors fleeing from ET. Will buy back at 14...or so
"Because BP holds a majority of the units, and from the outset (of the IPO filing) has reserved the right to cause the general partner to dilute (or abdicate even) it’s fiduciary duties to minority shareholders, they seem to hold all the cards in this situationThey can try to buy out the unaffiliated partnership units cheaply, which caps the upside holders, and if it turns out that a deal is not in BP’s interest for whatever reason, they could even withdraw their ‘non binding’ offer at any time, thus opening up the downside again in the marketNow BP is a professionally run and well regarded global enterprise that has a lot to lose reputation wise, so I would expect them to do the minimum necessary to create at least the appearance of fairness, and that is all that minority investors have going for them"
Hot D Am n another dividend increase & currently under 16 a share SOMETHING NOT Adding 
Thank you weak hand sellers for opportunity to enter at this SP
BP Midstream Partners is up 10.66% to 10.38
BPMP is up 5.75% to 20.77
"issue w oil pipeline business is that the demand for oil wasn't as high as what we all thoughtalso, higher oil price doesn't mean anything for midstream co as there is no incentive on itwe expect midstream stocks to be staying 10% div yield price range for next 24 months"
"Let me understand this. $1.39 Distribution,which according to Management will be increased by at least 10% this year (implies $1.54) .Well covered. And the units are below $10..How long before BP rolls this up ? IPO was $18.Certainly hasn't reduced cost-of-capital to finance Dropdowns."
Anyone looking to exit based on the buy out proposal (at the tentative price of $13.01) would do well to carefully look into the governing documentation before you exit in the marketI believe the $13.01 price mentioned in the offer is tentative (also non binding) and the final terms of the buy out are subject to negotiations that likely got kicked off last night
Keeping distribution flat for 4th quarter..ill bet they raise in April..
BPMP is up 71.66% to 21.44
BPMP is down -5.06% to 18.40
Great day for the group but this one down 6%...perhaps the rumors of no more distribution increases will be validated....a 10% yield like the shell mlp suggests a $12 unit price..
"$16 price target, then $19. PLUS, upgrade. PLUS dividend. PLUS Shell midstream has good guidance for rest of this year."
"No news I can find to drive that kind of decline. Most recent news is good - increased dividend to $.30, target stock price from analysts at $21+. This MLP hasn’t received much attention, especially given it’s an offshoot of BP. That should change as more analysts initiate coverage."
this thing is looking pretty good at ~$17?
Where are the earnings ?Supposed to be out before market open today
Well now what...unfortunately..Money Flow has turned down.....which indicates lower....9.38 is a tad of support
THIS STOCK PAYS A HUGE DIVIDEND.
BPMP reached an all time low at $14.57
"sold BP at 39.94, bought bpmp at 17.96."
"Doesn't BP Pipelines own BP Holdco? ...and BP Holdco owns 54% of BPMP meaning BP Pipelines can offer whatever low price they want and they ""own"" the votes for the deal to go thru?"
Need to announce share buy back at these prices..
why is this stock so volatile?
Distribution increase in April imo.
is this the bottom...added at 17.Its a 6% yield at 17.
"""Quiet time over"" 6 analysts now covering with range of 20-24.00 ! Time to but some more.If they run this as well as other ventures, come 1st earnings call, should make a nice up-tick. Especially if yield comes in higher than predicated 5-6%. Always a chance of things going South, but my bet is this one could be a 10 bagger in years to come. That refinery [Whiting] is major supplier of midwest consumption."
Dist. declared tomorrow..Expect flat with Q 1..
Picked up some more @ 14…70 ready to see growth and nice divi
BPMP reached a new All Time High at 21.93
"Immaterial impact to Earnings,EBITDA or DCF from oil prices up or down..Gave guidance for 2019 and 2020 on the 3q Earnings call...Mid -teens Distribution increases both years..Guidance suggests $1.35 and $1.55 in 2019 and 2020 respectively ...Its all about Volumes and they will be delivered regardless..Oil price affects the Unit price,but not Company fundamentals.. Collect the Distributions and think happy thoughts !!"
Same old manipulation by market makers driving down the price after ex-dividend. wall street is rigged and crooked and NOT a free and fair market place.
Wonder if this will be added to AMLP? Good yield...also looks secure.?.
"This is an outstanding purchase, surprised there's not a lot more action!"
Distribution to be announced the latter part of January. Looking Good.
"Right now MLPs are radioactive right now but I touched this one anyway and bought small amount today at $11.06. MLPs can really inflict some cyclical pain. I never learn, sigh."
BPMP is up 10.06% to 9.08
Will this happen to other midstreams?
BPMP reached a new All Time High at 22.55
"BP received 17.58 four years ago when it went public, why should it be worth less now?"
I certainly would not sell here as the downside has been fixed...What is the risk of buying except sterile $$ ??
"Honestly, if you are long on all these midstream companies, just buy it every week whether it is up or down.Right now, it's creating an investment opportunity for the following reason:1) index fund/ETF put these companies as oil stocks which is not correct - no impact on oil price whatsoever. midstream companies are merely transportation companies.2) 10% yield seems to be low given people are chasing after growth/meme stocks and cryto.3) catalyst being tax free has not been realized as the government has not been increasing tax rates yet4) inflation + higher interest rate will be another catalysts as people will turn into conservative stocks like this one.Good luck,"
Why is BIG Money avoiding this stock?
"price can not even get to the lowest price target, much less the highest PT."
Easiest 20%growth in the space..
BP probably figures why not keep the dividends.
"Looks great. Bought a bunch today. Thanks for the heads-up, Motley Fool, as i'd never heard about this company before today."
Divy hunters have arrived. Nice little run up happening
Started buying in the low $16. keeping my BP
"This one is hard to figure.Was trading near $17,raised Distribution by about 15%, again, and its back to near a 10% yield..I guess no interest in small cap MLP'S...BP should roll it up, but until then i like Tax advantaged income at a heavily discounted price.."
ON track to be paying $1.40 a year from now...10% yield on current price....I like it !!
"Analysts, per whisper, predict 100% beat on earnings and 100% on price to rise. Earnings Consensus: $0.40 Revenue: $31.24 Mil"
Oil demand way up. BPMP paying close to 10% dividend yield and with demand surging. What is not to like?
largest volume yesterday and today that I can remember. Looks like a large holder took a tax loss. Stock should trade up when he's done
Traded over 12...huge volume..
"loves BPMP...with this recent acquisition & large dip due to market correction, time to buy."
What is the offer? $13.01 a share and 1/2 share of BP
I expect an increase in the distribution to $1.25 Annualized very soon...would not be inconsistent with guidance.
Trying to decide weather to buy more at this low price or just hang in where with what I have. Decisions!
The price dropped late yesterday on no news and no announced insider trading.
Days away from another nice distribution increase..
why down 5% in three days in an up market?
"It's like everything after May 5th was smoke and mirrors. PAA is not alone here, many other MLPS track this same trajectory. $PAA, $PSXP, $MPLX, $BPMP, $PBFX, $WES... Don't know when it's coming, but it will. We are ALL due..."
"13 shares, THIRTEEN SHARES, sold in pre-market to drive the stock price down 12 points. Wow, shorts are sure desperate to get everyone to sell, sell, sell, sell their shares"
"Fair value would be 18.5, anything less there will be lawsuits"
Demand keeps going up. Price of oil really does not matter here. Demand flowing is what is going to continue to make BPMP SP go .
"I""m not a Zacks fan but they have raised their Rating and consensus EPS estimate.Distribution will be announced mid July and there is some reason to believe it will be increased...Imo."
"Steve might be correct. The midstream companies will be in place and earning pretty much the same revenue and paying the same dividends whether the dow, naz, crude, pandemic, or economy is up or down. BPMP is a revenue stream type of company rather than a flash in the pan meme stock. And there should be growth with accompanying rise in stock price to price targets of $16 and then to $19 as BPMP's revenue allows purchase of more midstream assets."
Good quarter especially in view of Storm related impact on volumes./3 year MVC contract with BP for onshore pipelines is a BIG deal in protecting the stability of Financial results. ..Overall impressive performance..
Looks like a very good quarter....most gas utilities can't keep up with demand due to heat wave....very bullish for pipe infrastructure.
When will the company announce if they are accepting BP's offer and negotiating for a better offer. There is almost no news about this company! Too small a company for anyone to pay attention to.
$0.3475 quarterly dividend announced - 7/28 ex-date
EPS 0.38 vs 0.35 estimate. Higher than divvy. Everything humming along just great. Good long term hold if you don't mind boring.https://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-midstream-partners/press-office/press-releases/bp-midstream-partners-reports-second-quarter-2020-results.html
reasonable possibility Distribution is raised on Thursday..imo
"price target $16, here we go."
Drop due to maintenance shutdown or other...? I added to position & took advantage.
Important decision for BPMP shareholders: https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5420615-challenging-future-for-oil-plus-recent-world-changing-fusion-energy-breakthrough-point
Can BPMP reject the offer of BP Pipelines? To make an offer below market price is almost an insult!
As Joe pointed out they did in fact increase the Dist. by about 15% annualized..in line with previous guidance..over 8% yield and 15% growth deserves more attention imo !!
Distribution increase tomorrow in my opinion
Sponsor. BP made another nice discovery with cvx in the deep water GOM..Near the Mad Dog 2 develoment...So near bpmp pipeline and the Argos platform which will produce 140kb/d by mid 2022...
BPMP is down -5.09% to 20.69
Another ~15% annualized Dist. increase..@ this rate will be paying ~$1.60 12 months from now....
Would not expect the conflicts committee to complete their Due Diligence until near the end of the quarter. No hurry. Hoping the final offer doesn't close until 2022
Results looked awesomehttps://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-midstream-partners/press-office/press-releases/bp-midstream-partners-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results.html
"Follow upIf you want more yield, try ENBL, set to be acquired by ET for .85 shares of ET stock later this year I own ENBL, I like it, do your own DD, it’s not a recommendation, just FYI"
"Keep an eye out for FERC rate adjustments in 2021, refinery maintenance shutdowns (or lack thereof), and the Cushing MLP Index. This could very well be the year where the midstream value proposition is rediscovered. With its assured revenue level from BP, BPMP is in a good position to capitalize. IMHO the 20's are near the horizon."
BPMP is down 5.14% to $14.76
"On Aug 06, JPM downgraded BPMP to ‘sell’ with a price target of $14; can someone who has access to the research please post the gist of the analyst’s logicBecause if there is a BP buyout announced based on which the price target is reset to $14, it is still a decent return in the near term, so I am curious how the analyst is supporting a ‘sell’ rating"
"Hi all, would like to seek some opinions here.I have bought BPMP in recent months, enticed by the big dividends and attractive SP.However, recently, at Telsa battery day, I learnt that they have plans to introduce US$25k EV to compete in the market. I understand there are still multiple issues with EV, from the cost, charging time, range, lack of charging infrastructure etc.Still, as I research further, many automakers are pouring their money into EV research and more EV models are coming. Future EV models and infrastructure will improve going forward. In addition, many countries will start to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles from 2030.Also, recently, BP Energy Outlook 2020 indicated that oil demand has reached its peak.As BPMP transports curde oil, so it will be impacted severely by the decreasing oil demand. Land transportation comprises of 66% oil demand. What do you all think about BPMP's prospect in 20 years time, in 2040?Can we hold long-term which is my plan?Thanks"
A beacon of green light in a sea of red
Seems extremely oversold but I am not the crooks getting the lowest prices by manipulating it.
What the heck happened? Down to $14.00 bucks.
Good earnings call.Solid results despite a tough environment.Strong outlook in spite of a minor storm impact on 4q volumes..Distribution flat thru 2020 but higher going forward..Great Balance Sheet and solid coverage ..
FERC typically allows Rate increases for Regulated Pipes in July..I assume that includes all Interstate lines and most certainly those transporting from Federal Leases like Offshore..Bpmp and Shlx among others are in the sweet spot in that regard..
"Did they mention a timeline? Will we get more dividends? Is this a good deal? Why, in your opinions, is this being done?"
"With this non binding proposal (sent to the board of BPMP) that contains a placeholder price (yesterday’s close), BP just signified it’s intent to buy out the minority unit holdersOf course the board of BPMP has a fiduciary duty to minority unit holders, so they will hire counsel and promptly enter into negotiations with BP to ensure a ‘fair’ transaction (to some degree everyone understands that this is a sham negotiation as BP will be on both sides of it, but form and defensibility are important to preserve their reputation)At the end of the negotiations, they will likely enter into an agreement accepting what is seen to be a fair offer price by BP; this agreement will conform with the preexisting mechanisms that govern the repurchase rights that BP has (which have been disclosed in the offering memorandum at the time of the public issuance of the units).The BPMP board will then recommend the proposed offer to the unit holders, and launch a public tender outlining the terms and procedure for tendering in the units (including the exchange mechanism for BP ADRs, if that is the consideration to be used by BP in the tender)Since this is a publicly traded SEC registered security, all of the above will be done in a formal manner with appropriate SEC filings, which will disclose the terms publicly and clearlyUntil that happens, nothing is final, so hold your horses and don’t take any hasty actions that might hurt you"
Without a pickup in buying s00n will fall into single digits
Why is the volume so high here?
"BPMP declared another distribution increase on July 17 to .3237. Yield is 8.2% Seven quarters in a row of increases, with more to come."
NEVER love a stock I l0ve this st0ck
"JamesI have a position in BKEP, this is not a recommendation, but rather an unusual situation It’s a former midstream that divested all oil/pipeline, now largest private asphalt terminal company, with presence in 26 statesStill MP, but I figure, if infrastructure gets passed, going to need to pave those roadsDo your own due diligence, and I have a position in, and like like BPMP"
We're stopped out at $13.01...cool..!!
"It will take a day before big bucks jump in, especially with consistent dividends and revenue stream."
Distribution up next week imo..
I got more order filled!BPMP let’s go!Oil is ready to recover
when is ex-dividend date for bpmp?
beat on earnings and revenue for the quarter.
pops3 minutes agoReplied to a reaction$BPMP conversationIt hasn’t been too long since annoucemt of buyout.The original offer is too low.Probably intentional.What would make you guys happy.?$14.50?$13.50?Or no buyout and we keep our chunky dividend !!
Finally found the ownership structure of BPMP and BP owns around 54% of BPMP which means they can sell the company without unitholders voting on the sale. https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/b/NYSE_BPMP_2017.pdf See page 10 for the chart.
BPMP is down 5.15% to $14.91
Any idea when the dividend declaration date is. Seems a bit late based on past history?
"""Fully Vaccinated U.S., EU Citizens Will Be Allowed Quarantine-Free Travel To England."" This means that ship and air travel and vacation travel will increase and so will demand for fuel from BPMP this quarter."
"Well, I guess the earnings report is about to start. Anyone tuned into that want to share the comments, financials, or guidance they perceive?"
"When does the company announce for dividend? Last year, it announced it on 4/15."
Been a good week
what. down 50 cents?
52 wk high Friday....
Another discount buying opportunity today!!!
the 10% dividend is legit?
Earnings release on Dec 6. Seems like they know something.
Better volume today and price up. Happy I bought in the other day.
awesome low price today I missed it.
"Expect this to gravitate back towards $15 , especially with dividend capture date approaching."
"I have no idea, No related news I can find. 50% higher than average volume. The AMLP is up 2,45%. Earnings scheduled for Nov 14. Hope that's not bad news. This is now down $1 from IPO price. Very irritating."
Today is distribution declaration day....Will they raise?
"Getting back in under 12.90. With dividend to capture this quarter and limited IMO downside risk with some upside, remains to be seen how much, will 13.01 deal hold or increase? Not a bad option in the current market."
Wow... thoughts about the offer??? Never seen an offer that actually drove the SP down...
"I expect that BPMP will announce their quarterly distribution next Thursday (7/15); I think that an increase is in the cards, but not quite sure how much. Anyone have any educated guess?"
This is a good stock to ride out a market correction in. No matter how low things go you’ll still get over 10% yield here.
I would be looking for $14 plus 1 more Distribution at a minimum..I think $14.50 total is in the cards...Hoping for a 2022 close. But that may be asking for too plenty..
read the CC transcripts.....my takeaway1) BP would like to do a dropdown this year but low BPMP unit price is a hindrance 2) BPMP IR tired of fielding calls and BP looking to do something.....to get the dropdown done....my guess is maybe a private placement to get the dropdown done this year......nothing mentioned about BP even thinking about rolling this back up.....meanwhile sit back and collect the distribution growing each quarter and don't stare at the unit price because it will only cause stress
Volume so somebody is buying!
"This is the rough calculation for BP:— at around $3/ADR of earnings, expected for FY2021, they have an earnings yield of 12% currently— the current earnings yield on the BPMP units is around 12% as well— but the existence of the BPMP public partnership is a costly nuisance for BP as BPMP places a lot of obligations and related expense (separate arms length governance and org structure, outside auditors, lawyers, tax accountants, etc)— and finally there is information pertaining to their operations that leaks out via the BPMP disclosures (you can make educated guesses as to what one of their biggest refineries in the US is doing based on the published throughput numbers in the BPMP onshore pipelines)So when you combine all of the above, at some low unit price (say $14-15), it makes sense to terminate the public partnership, which in any case is being consolidated into BP’s financial results based on their majority ownershipSaves money, simplifies everything and keeps operational flow information confidential; what’s not to like?My guess is that they will come out with a tender price in the range of $14-15, and perhaps pay that in the form of BP ADRs (this part I don’t get, as BP just announced an ongoing share repurchase program, so why add to outstanding shares? Why not just take the BPMP units out for cash?)"
"This price has me wanting to buy more, I love a good sale. But I'm also wondering what is dropping this price so much...is there something I'm missing?"
BPMP reached an all time low at $14.29
Volume has been very low the last couple sessions.. I guess people are holding and waiting to see if we get a better offer?
"For some reason, shorts and hedge funds are trying to crash this stock and company by manipulation and insider trading. BPMP is going to have a good ER according to the analysts. And shorts know this, so by forcing the price down through manipulation, buyers will buy into BP midstream and give the rats and roaches a free ride up cause there sure is not any news to warrant today's drop. They can not make money honestly. So, they use insider trading on insider knowledge of when the price is going up to force the price down. And the SEC just watches as it did when bernie madoff bilked investors for decades."
Conflicts Committee should have a response soon..At least by eom.
Now c'mon baby get into your slide............................seriously when this stock bottoms i will buy it but until then just watching and waitingwhat would GANN say?
2Q Dist. increase 14.4% annualized...continues to impress.
"Reading various research pieces and commentaries, there are two paths for BP to get this done without resorting to its ‘limited call’ right— submit the final negotiated terms to the conflicts committee of BPMP and have it rule on whether BP can vote its units (which already constitute a majority)— if the conflicts committee rules in favor, then the vote becomes a formality and the deal is basically done as submitted (this is not to be confused with the $13.01 initial offer)— if the conflicts committee determines that BP cannot vote its shares (this is a low likelihood event but can happen when the CC regards the terms of the BP offer to be patently unfair to minority unit holders), then a vote will be held where only the non BP unit holders will be asked to vote, which is a longer process and will obviously involve various public communications— an altogether separate process for BP to buy out the minority unit holders is to acquire enough units, one way or another, to overcome the threshold (80%) for it to exercise its limited call right, and then call the remaining units"
PROFITABLE COMPANY PAYING AN AWESOME DIVIDEND. You would think the price would be at around 15 times earnings which is normal.
"$BPMP announced its cash dividend of $0.3475, a slight increase from $0.347.My guess is that $PSXP, $SHLX may follow..."
Conflicts Committee should be close to a decision.Its been over a month.Perhaps negotiating. I have been involved in many Valuation analysis and Fairness opinions.It's not rocket science...Much of the Background is often done pre offer.
"I bought some at ~$11 and some ~$8 and I sold it all ~$9. So I lost money. If it goes to ~$6 I'd probably just buy some more. Some people never learn, sigh."
"This is the most boring stock on the planet, but I'll take the 9% and ever growing dividend"
"I came across a Shell news release regarding the Mars LOOP interests for upgrades to storage capacities! I understand BP has partial ownership in these storage caverns and is upping capacity along with Shell, this is an accumulate!https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-midstream-results/shell-midstream-offers-mars-sour-crude-storage-as-offshore-producers-keep-pumping-idUSKBN22J2XS"
Shlx has been trading well partly due to its Sponsor (rds)start up of a new Transportation system in the gulf of Mexico to feed the proteus and endymion pipelines..Bpmp owns 42.25 % of each.. BP doesn't seem to want anyone to know..kinda explains why it's MLP remains invisible and has a 9%+ distribution yield despite 15% distribution growth...
here we go!
does it make sense to accumulate shares as long as they are under 13.01?? that's the floor here right?
"Distribution for 2021 Q2 is unchanged:BP Midstream Partners LP (“BPMP” or the “Partnership”) today announced that the Board of Directors of BP Midstream Partners GP LLC,the general partner of the Partnership, declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3475 per unit for the second quarter of 2021, consistent with the level of distribution for the first quarter 2021.The second quarter 2021 distribution will be payable on August 12, 2021, to unitholders of record as of July 29, 2021, with an ex-distribution date of July 28, 2021."
"Off topic question: Is it possible to cash out of my Roth ira before the 5 year time? I am 74 and have only had the Roth for abouit 5 years. what are the Fines, etc for early withdrawal? Thank You,"
BPMP is down -5.00% to 17.85
Strong q4.Guiding 10% Distribution increase in 2020 assuming no dropdown. Will self fund organic growth in 2020 while maintaining 1.1x to 1.2x coverage..
Any chance BP will buy in BPMP like others parents are doing to their MLP's.
"Thanks, all. I am very familiar and hold shares in BPMP and EPD. Not selling for now. Agree BP may terminate the mlp. Also agree with Johm, EPD is a buy, especially with the upcoming Houston Index, with MMP and possibly others."
BPMP reached an all time low at $15.27
BPMP is down 4.98% to $15.97
"BPMP declared another distribution increase on January 16 to .3475. Yield is 7.8% Eight quarters in a row of increases, with more to come. The press releases never get posted. Need to show them a little love!"
BP offers $13.01 for BPMP. https://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-midstream-partners/press-office/press-releases/bp-pipelines-makes-offer-to-acquire-bp-midstream-partners-and-bp-midstream-partners-reports-second-quarter-2021-results.htmlSeems a little low and needs to be sweetened some.
BPMP is down 4.90% to $16.30
Are call options affected by the offer if it is accepted?
Seems like our options contracts are frozen by 13.00 stock price as BP Holdco has upper hand on holding price at 13.00 since they announced their majority interest in BPMP at time of proposal. Contracts will expire long before a reasonable offer comes on the table. This stock should trade for over 16.00 and the current situation by BP Holdco is damaging to Options Contract holders. Does anyone know what will happen to the Options contracts that are now in a lame duck situation caused by BP Holdco for likely their benefit. Am I the only one uncertain about this and frustrated? Am I missing something in my analysis?
BPMP is up 5.47% to 20.63
"With an initial and minimum distribution of $1.05 p.a., BP Midstream now yields 6.0% p.a. at $17.40. As General Partner, BP is committed and incentivized to grow the MLP with dropdown acquisitions by 15% plus every year. Yes, this will go higher as its 6.0% yield is well above Shell Midstream's 4.8% (IPO'd in 2014 and has continued to grow the distribution)."
you can see Bp and Shell top of the list of Bidens Approved Permits for oil... The market will swing back around. We are all going to be ok....
BP Midstream Partners is up 5.13% to 12.90
"Continues to climb, earnings due out soon..."
Wahoo another dividend increase but minute
BPMP is up 5.00% to $16.81
This should be up to 15 at the least by now what’s happening
So here we sit at $14.36!
Earnings will be good and SP will continue to rise while we get paid fat dividend
"Heading for that $20 level, once above we should have a new floor.Oil on way back up!"
BP Midstream Partners is down 5.00% to 10.44
Earnings release and call tomorrow..fyi
"Crude up, indices up, bpmp languishes."

About a month away from another distribution increase to about $1.40 annually...almost a 10%yield...
BPMP is down 5.25% to $15.51
52 week high today..
Declared distribution on the 15th of October and about if not the same day in July ..So Friday??.
"Immediate Price target $16, longer term: $19 according to yahoo summary page (but for market maker manipulators, hedge funds and sellers of tens of thousands naked short shares.)"
This stock should be $17 or better now.
"Well Gene you are right, I guess people are just busy celebrating. I own lots of pipelines shares spread across 9 companies. I have been out buying stuff and eating way too much. I bought into BPMP bigger than SHLX the same day both have gone up but I had a better initial cost on BPMP. I doubted myself last week buying even more ET, but darn I am buying more even today. I stopped buying WES and EPD way to early.The profit that’s coming especially in the third quarter is going to be simply amazing.RegardsJohn"
Ex div date Jan 27. I would expect to see a nice run up in the next 2 weeks
Bp and Shell started Manuel development with the first 2 wells each producing about 10kb/d as wells are added Bpmp. And shlx will benefit Gulf of Mexico is a major source of production growth for BP and Shell....and therefore Bpmp and Shlx..
BPMP is up 5.12% to 18.48
all the buying is due to inclusion into the cushing indexCushing Asset Management and Swank Capital Announce Rebalancing of the Cushing MLP High Income Index
pre market down .34....distribution is also. 34. it will be interesting to see what it closes at.
X div next Wed the 28th. FYI
BPMP is down -5.71% to 19.97
Can someone who has access to a Bloomberg terminal post the following:— the average closing price of BPMP for the 90-days prior ending with Aug 04— the average of the VWAP for the same period
"Continued volume as investors buy for earnings release tomorrow,"
RAISED distribution to $1.34 ....up 14.4% annualized..Will probably do the same next quarter...
"I really feel like I must be missing something. BPMPs income (I think) comes mostly from transporting domestic oil and gas production. The drop in oil price should not affect the domestic volume being transported, at least in the short term (maybe very long term if we stop drilling due to low oil prices). The transportation fees are contacted very long term, Why such a low multiple? Seriously, where is the risk I'm missing?"
This stock sure seems like a great value right now. Just hovers around the 52L and has a nice distribution that is very well covered. Adding to my position here for income. BP will likely buy it back at 20 someday soon.
"BTW, the shorts are going to have to pomy up $260,00+ or - on the 15th for the div pmt."
if I buy tomorrow Will I receive dividend ? Please let me know
BP Midstream Partners reached an all time low at 12.04
.39/.40 estimated. .37 reported
Probably Tortioise or Kayne Anderson....2 largest holdings besides the Sponsore BP...BTW got a kick out of the comment about the distribution being safe..Since the GP is one of the financially strongest companies in the world backstopping
"Cost basis 22k, gains $9k.If I had a time machine I would go back and put everything on BPMP when it was $9 a share."
BPMP is up 5.00% to 21.63
"Economy is still improving (dow, naz up, gold is down). BPMP declared dividends and will have a very good ER this week and outlook for the rest of the year and this quarter. But articles say hedge funds have invaded the company's stock which is negative. Stock market (and the USA) is going to crash when market maker insiders are manipulating stocks."
Had a great time made some money. time for me to deleverage.
this is a weird stock. not anything like what I expected. sure seems like some one has figured out how to manipulate it.theoretically...and timing was perfect for my objective. But these 10 % daily swings. what causes those??
"I thought a buyout had to be the average of the last 3 months stock price?Also, my understanding is that BP would have to own 80% of BPMP; otherwise, it has to be voted on by stock holders?"
Over 10% distribution yield on January Increase Annualized...Bullet proof Sponsor. Good coverage..What's not to like..
Have to hand it to the shorts selling thousands of naked short shares and hedgies and option traders using market maker manipulators to hold the price down using computer algorithms. It must be nice to trade on insider knowledge of when price will be allowed to go up or down.
any update regards to the distribution?
What happened today ? anyone ..
BP Midstream Partners is up 5.14% to 10.03
"This became dead money. Was good while it lasted. Check our Ring Energy-REI. Earnings next week, smaller oil company benefiting from strengthening financial and market conditions. Also like GTE- however this is the time to accumulate for good returns later in year/2022 for GTE, their story is just starting to take beneficial shape."
Almost 9 times average volume today maybe parent buying up as many shares as possible on open market
Sweet ! BP easily beats earnings and revenue expectations ! UP we go ! The price of oil has increased significantly over the last few weeks so 2nd quarter results should be much higher. The July dividend increase could put a smile on all our faces !
To much deregulation and manipulation of energy markets Mr President will back fire and end up being a job killer. Millions of US oil and gas jobs are hanging in the balance in this low price environment.
Another m l p that lost its support and didn't rise over 20 despite dividend increases and a rising price of oil. WHAT NOW? back to the financial calculators
5 and 6 shares traded at a time by computer algorithms. What a scam wall street is.
"$0.005 over minimum distribution , what is the story with that 1/2 cent?"
"Well, all indicators and I think bpmp should go up with its success. But ONLY 11 shares bought pre market, so that indicates hedge funds and shorts are going to pile in to sell their naked short shares in the market to drive the share price down."
BPMP is up 5.18% to $15.63
With a 12.3% dividend this could go to $8 and I’ll be green. How on earth are people not buying. ?Maybe the midstream partners need some PR?
Well now at $16.46 How many still think its thumbs down not to have added more at $14. If you were one of those Please don't give any one advice.
BPMP is up 5.02% to $16.75
About a month away from another 15% distribution increase..
I can’t believe people are selling off a stock that pays a 12+% dividend.What do they plan on doing with the money when the world ends.?Cause that’s what will happen if the oil and gas stops flowing.
Where is everyone? I bought BPMP again today and all my pipelines went up. All month it has been great to own a lot of pipeline shares.RegardsJohn
When is the Next Ex-Dividend Date?
Another new 52wk high. Distribution increase in the cards ??
"I got out at $13.16 and bought EPD at $22.23, lost about .59 cents on 3000 shares but I expect EPD to make it up and keep performing long term. Got out of SHLX at $13.56 also went to EPD. May move some more things while EPD still under $23.00. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide what to do, who knows what will happen but I already bet the ranch on EPD anyway.Best to AllJohn"
First deal for BPMP. Accretive to the dividends...https://seekingalpha.com/news/3394393-bp-midstream-acquires-bp-assets-468m-dropdown-deal
BPMP is up 5.09% to 18.17
KEYSTONE PL canceled a big plus for GOM and Permian Player s..Bpmp and Shlx are particularly benefited...
Nice bump!
The analysis do not know how to evaluate BPMP they treat like it is common stock instead of a MLP the yield is wonderful and their assets are premium.I am adding more for the yield since this thing is trading below its actual value.
BPMP reached a new All Time Low at $16.25
"Crude is up, shell midstream is up, bpmp languishes."
Distribution declaration is usually on the 17th.. so a month from today...Here's hoping we get a raise..
28% annualized Dist. increase..
Since BP owns more than 50% of BPMP their offer of $13.01 may not be increased since they can control the vote.
A drop to add $20mm to 4q DCF and assures 15% Dist.growth in 2019 ...And the units trade down ?? Help me here !!!!
"There is a ‘limited call’ mechanism that the general partner has that allows them to purchase the partnership units they don’t already own; it is triggered by the sponsor ((BP) having at least 80% of the outstanding units; the GP can issue enough new units to BP to satisfy this requirement and trigger the call; this new unit issuance does not require a vote of the unit holdersFrom memory, the repurchase price in that event is based on the average unit price over the prior 90 days (?), I believe, so it is basically a smoothed market priceThis is the only way BP can take out the minority partnership unit holders (probably why the proposal from this morning characterized the offer as ‘non binding’), and it is where this is transaction is headed, most likelyThis is a professional British enterprise; they will do the ‘fair thing’; the potential for reputational damage is too great otherwise"
Should I buy a $5000 % cd and get 1.5 percent interest eventually or buy $5000 of bpmp stock and get 9% dividends plus possible spikes in stock price........seems easy to me
Distribution. Going up this week..Paying out $1.35 this year..
"It would seem appropriate for there to be some news, scheduling, anticipated deadlines, etc, issues by management or simply discussed. Keeping quiet will appear more of an “inside job” in the shareholder lawsuits."
Declared Distribution unchanged from previous Quarter..
