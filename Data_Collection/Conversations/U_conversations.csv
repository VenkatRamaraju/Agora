"@Jester, Bull, Bear, or just a swing trade here? Small position @125. Looking for more. Insider selling, 5.45% - short, and lack of profit are concerning. Quality of product and asset growth look tremendous. Pullback under $100 looks like a reach. What price target do you like to add? Thanks"
Stock just made a golden cross end of last week.
What a great investment. Regret not having bought more
How many times do I have to tell you that betting against me is VERY bad for your portfolio?!?
I’m back at 690% gain on my $170 leaps I took my profit and keeping some to see if I get 10x on those that would be amazing 
Today will see 90
tesla ai really points to how early we are in particle simulation and ar. happy long holder!
I wish I have had added shares while it was 90ish. I believe U is going to be a fantastic company in the future
Unity has to fill gap $147. News will be coming on partnership soon
It’s a 2 horse race: Unreal (owned by Epic Games which is largely owned by Tencent) or Unity. I like both engines. But I like investing directly in Unity as opposed to roundabout investing in Unreal via Tencent.
Time to add $200 by year end!
"All we need is a green day, there is no resistance at the current levels!"
$150 by Friday?
"134$ I called it, I'm the beeeessssstttttt!!"
No OnE CoMEs CloSE! Mmmkay!
I muted Jester a long time ago: Please pass him my best regards 
Senior VP's dumping shares in this range. No confidence.
"Great earnings, 55% of loss revenue is actually amazing as they’re using to expand their business and they’re acquiring more companies and they’re not just a gaming platform, they’re starting to be in every sector.Congratulations to all the shareholders"
SP would be 300 in next 3 years.
"I do not know the future, but I can tell you that U is one of the latest IPO's that will go down in history like Shopify and better. I am praying that U can quickly seizes upon payment solution as part of its own offering and not a collaboration. Collaboration is OK with a eye to eventually integrate it within U. U will be among top 10 companies in US."
"If it means anything: short position went up again by 0.1 days. Meaning 3.4 days as of yesterday to 3.5 days as of this evening. Essentially, over the last few days as U is going up shorts are taking position I expectation that U will go down, and I think ig is not going down unless market tanks. So do not be surprised to see short crowd showing up soon to bash U!!!"
I see $160 is coming!!!
Why Unity Software Inc. Is Dropped? Source: http://clickinstantt.qlitrk.com/r/xzad
I like the future of this company but the stock is to high right now. I will start purchasing under $125
I apologize for it taking 2 days for me to be correct once again. NO ONE comes close.
"As a developer, Unity is one of the best platforms to work with. It's UX is one of the best. As the platform starts to spread to other industries outside of gaming, it will grow and scale well because of its usability. Unity reminds me of Adobe in the early 2000s."
"Need some vote of confidence , Will unity ever reach 170 again? Otherwise Im selling and not looking back"
"Look at the latest Benzinga article. MASSIVE insider selling of Unity. As usual, I was ahead of the curve, I told you this YESTERDAY! NO ONE comes close!"
"Why insider selling everything, going to crash ?"
Can we see a 120 close? 
Warning this board contains emotional vampire named Jester  if such a being contacts you and try to feed of your energy the best course of action is to ignore the thing.
Stay tuned for the paper bagger to predict something big in a couple of days!!
"Nothing as changed with the fundamentals of Unity but only getting better. Yesterday we had several bad things. Facebook outage,interest rates speck going higher,and CEO selling his planned years every month.Unity will bounce to fill the gap and with earnings coming soon it will prove that the market cap will get justified.Metaverse is not early but gaining mono. UNITY will be $250 by end of 2022."
"Yesterday, U was the stock of the day at Investors Business Daily. Nice write up."
"Well done PAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF and MVST and NIOMONEY right there guys!"
Unity is golden this is all because of the biggest Chinese real-estate developer being on a path to declare bankruptcy and It all leads to what J Pow will say this Wednesday regarding tapering. I would expect this all to clear out soon and we might have some good opportunities to buy the dip this week.

"For all those who think that I'm dishonest, 5 moths Ago I wrote ""Loaded up plenty of calls today while on discount, I couldn’t resist :)"" the price of U at the time was around 85 and I bought calls/leaps with expiration Jul2022 with a strike spread from 90 to 170, I closed around half of them and I bough shares and I still have these.Unity Software Jul2022 90 C, Open Price: 13.70, % Change 286.13%Unity Software Jul2022 170 C, Open Price: 2, % Change 560%At a later point I also bought Unity Software Jul2022 115 C, Open Price: 15.09, % Change 135.92%"
Welp tomorrow could be the break out :)
"A so-called ""golden cross"" has formed on Unity chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bullish for the stock.WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used.The golden cross occurs when the 50-day crosses above the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing."

"This stock makes my mouth water. Amazing company, placed well at cusp of a new dawn towards the meta verse, and more or less the shopify of gaming and VR/AR."
"Mr Unity Doom predictor, Jestor, FYI: short position in U dropped from 3.3 days to 3.1 days. I guess they end up covering their position through option market. U closed $136.76. I bet they end up paying $1.76 plus the premium they paid to bug options for strike price of $135. Well that was smart, it is better to cover through option market then in open market. But still lost a lot in covering their shorts. No wonder Jester is talking about shorting around $140. Basically, yesterday short covering end up costing them $140 or so. Jester you and your cronies need to short U man, longs will buy from you and then sell back much higher prices."
"NICE we broke the 150 residence, congrats longs"
"If you're lucky, I might give you my next range, but I think I've made enough people rich for now. Time to enjoy the fruits of my labor for a bit."
"Jester, Dr. Unity Doom for aster. To my shock, Jim Cramer thinks u is even better than RBLX. He was nog even going to consider looking at it till it is below $50. Have you also changed your mind or you you investment expertise till call for Unity belonging in your burning dumpster. I feel sorry for you misleading any good investor away from U. Jestor, bad Karma for you brother!"
$150+ coming around the corner
"My dip buys yesterday all single letter stocks, that's wierd. U, S, Z"
Will Chinese not be able to afford app games now? U is down more than most.
"Insiders are selling, too. Clive Downie 33,333 shares on Sept 7th form filing, and Ruth Ann Keene, 7,000 shares on Form 4 Sept 13th filing."
Will be near shopify prices in 5-10 years
so glad I doubled my position yesterday at 11am.
"Jester, mentioned that he will short when it gets to 140. Get ready to buy from Jester. He called U Pig. Well, Pig is doing damn good."
I am comparing unity to many crypto projects and basically this is 30-40 billion give or take. ETH has a 400 billion MC...many projects on par with U MC. HOWEVER they have no where near the use case and level of engagement has U. Which means we are probably 5-10x undervalued. Thoughts? zuckerberg said this company in the wrong hands would ruin them
TIKTOK just bought VR headset company. really good news to Unity.
Apple decided to showcase the M1 Pro/Max by showing Unity instead of any other game engine. Unity is Apple approved

Welcome to September’s
41B cap.. less than 1B revenue and still losing money.. what?!
exciting company. !metaverse! GL to all longs here.
Possible head and shoulders forming on the 30 days. Look out.

Any thoughts for Unity to challenge Autodesk at some point in the future? I understand autodesk has a wide moat.

"Wednesday CPI report, the last obstacle between $U and the moon :D"
"Here is some analysis on U stock. Really basic but just some assumptions:Assumptions: Unity Revenue FY2021 = 1 BillionShares Outstanding increase by 93% to 550 Million by 2030. I believe this is fair because only about five million or approximately 7% of shares have been added since they went public. (According to YCharts)Bear Case:Unity Revenue Growth = 20% over 9 years to 2030 which is cumulative growth of 416% (1.2^9=5.16)Unity FY2030 = 5.16 BillionProfit Margin = 0.2; This takes into account that RnD expenses cut in half and SGA stay the same as a percentage of revenue.Unity Profit = 1.03 BillionUnity Earnings (After Tax of 20%) = 825 MillionUnity EPS = 1.5Unity PE = 60; Given the company will still have revenue growth in the high teens in this assumption and a major portion of their profit is being consumed by RnD that can be railed in, I believe this is fair.Unity Price Per Share = A measly 90 dollar pps in 10 years?!?! I don't know if I did something wrong. Revenue growth hitting this low would be absurd though.Base Case:Unity Revenue Growth = 30% over 9 years to 2030 which is cumulative growth of 960% (1.3^9=10.6). This is in line with management guidance.Unity FY2030 = 10.6 BillionProfit Margin = 0.2; This takes into account that RnD expenses cut in half and SGA stay the same as a percentage of revenue.Unity Profit = 2.12 BillionUnity Earnings (After Tax of 20%) = 1.7 BillionUnity EPS = 3.09Unity PE = 100; Given the company will still have revenue growth in the high twenties in this assumption and a major portion of their profit is being consumed by RnD that can be railed in, I believe this is fair.Unity Price Per Share = 309 dollars. Bull Case:Unity Revenue Growth = 40% over 9 years to 2030 which is cumulative growth of 1960% (1.4^9=20.66). Unity FY2030 = 20.66 BillionProfit Margin = 0.4; This takes into account that RnD decrease significantly to near zero and SGA decrease by as a percentage of revenue. This margin is similar to that of Autodesk.Unity Profit = 8.26 BillionUnity Earnings (After Tax of 20%) = 6.11 BillionUnity EPS = 12.02Unity PE = 100; Given the company will still have revenue growth in the high thirties, I believe this is fair.Unity Price Per Share = A 1202 dollars. Basically a 10x.The tricky part about valuing Unity is their RnD expenses which eat into their profits. Unity as of now is a profitable company but it appears that they must cut into their revenue to drive growth. Another thing is revenue growth which changes their FY2030 revenues significantly. Last year it was 43% and this year management is aiming for 31%. Also, I don't know what their SGA costs are being allocated to and therefore may not have properly gauged their profitability, but it has increased with revenue closely. I also may have been too conservative on PE ratios and the company may be valued as if they had higher profit margins as the RnD can be railed in.IMO I think the share price will be somewhere between my base and bull case.If you actually read this, what are your thoughts on how things could differ? Serious answers only please."
Unfortunately we will have to wait for the CPI report on 14th before we can make a leap.
"I just bought 130 calls, let’s see how it plays out :)"
Looks like some resistance at around $127ish. Might be good for a pop if it holds one or two tests.
It finally breaks thru the $140 wall. Congratulations to all patient fellow long friends! Sky is limit for U

"Poor Vijay, rode this down $22 bucks just like I said he would. This is what happens when you don't listen to me."
"$135 resistance, another perfect call. Low volume, if it doesn't break and hold today or Monday, likely a good short point. Of course, this isn't investment advice."

What a beautiful thing to find a Gem and stay with it during ups and down because no one know when great stock breaks through to upside. Learned to find great stock, keep it accumulating when others are dumping and doubting. Ignore the noise of short sellers and day traders. All longs and the one from IPO days deserve my hats off for holding U. WOW, what a day!"
Where is Jester . Did the nursing home cut off his internet access?
Is Jester a narcissist? Thumb's up = Yes. Thumbs Down = No
"Jester, based in your posts it seems you have made good money, and I am glad you made money. Well brother, now our time has come to make money and enjoy this premier company for many years to come.

Great company to own and keep for next 10 years.
what is happening? I am long here for almost a year don't pay attention to the news though.
will unity reach 90 again ?
Unity Metacast!!!
"THIS IS HUGE!!! Epic vs Apple trial, verdict “developers must be allowed to inform users of alternative ways to pay within app” which means that Unity can develop and use its own in games payment system and to generate extra profit from it. Apple vs. Epic ruling reveals 70% of App Store revenue (72 billions for 2020) comes from a small fraction of customers playing games and since almost 70% of the games in Apple store are built with Unity, Unity is a clear winner here! The future is very bright for Unity and its only getting better and better"

If it bounce back quick enough that will be good for your calls as well since the price of the options raises with increased volatility.

"Jester, BTW, CW has been selling TSLA lately. Would love to know your wisdom regarding this."
Please note that this is not a Unity weakness as its following the exact defined Beta of 3.2 in relation to Nasdaq. Please also be aware that most of the trades are done automatically by algorithms hence these measurements matters and macroeconomics DD should always come before the technical analysis of the stock movements. Good luck all
150 today
"Recovery spendings are not as expected and are slowing down, not so great for value and cyclicals however it should be great for growth stocks as it should bring the inflation down. Once we see the inflation inflection point U will skyrocket"
Does anyone know why unity’s share count went from 129 million to 280 million shares? That’s basically $20 billion on the current market cap but I don’t see where anything near that amount is on the balance sheet ? Was this money basically extracted by employees at the expense of shareholders? Did management just make some epically boneheaded decisions? Where exactly is the black hole and how long can unity trade 40 times sales and continue to lose money. We can all agree it’s probably not gonna be the next sales force or even peoplesoft for that matter
Mark my words this will hit 134-134.10$ soon! I'm the best!
Back to $ 150 real soon
Will unity continue to fall?
Well back to $140 hopefully this holds

Cathie probably reads my posts for advice. Wouldn't surprise me.
Cathie must feel terrible to have listened to Jester.

Expect Jester and other shorts to start showing up as over the last few weeks Short position has increased from 2.2 days to 4.4 days. Highest position I have ever seen is 4.8 days.
cramer just had ceo as guest..kiss of death? or a good buy?
"WOW, volume picking up as ot goes higher. I have not seen this for some time!"
Unity back to 90?
Just to be clear this is just a red day meaning the whole sector suffers and there so NO resistance near the current levels. Unity has a gap to fill up to $145 and will do that as soon as Macroeconomics trends will allow it.
Metaverse is 5 to 7 years away according to Facebook and analysts who cover the sector. This is not even remotely a near term catalyst to buy the stock. A lot of the froth will come out of the shares in the meantime
Wow 139… are we looking at 170 soon?
sold all my unity shares coz ARK has been unloading past few weeks & earnings call coming up.good luck to all....
Will it go to 115 so i can buy?
"CW has sold and bought small fraction of TSLA, SHOP and U etc, amd still those are her top 10 holdings. Underlying intent is to temporarily shift funds from an appreciated asset to another irrationally beaten down asset. Selling an asset mainly for profit is different than selling to use funds to buy something which is suddenly more than reasonably priced. That bis what astute investors do!"
"That Epic won the battle vs. Apple is epic for Unity! ??? not just that they can now pocket more money... they didn't #$%$ off Apple via legal battle but still have all the benefits and saved internal resources. Great long-term investment, great leadership, great products and services and future market (especially with the Metaverse)! PT $215 in a year from now, $550ish in 5 years. Stay long and strong folks and get rich"
I'm even richer!!! You're welcome.
And yes Unity is golden as soon as macroeconomics trends will allow it it will fill the gap to $145 in no time.
Needs to break $138 then heads to $200+
I just close my calls at 80% gain  will be adding to my shares now
