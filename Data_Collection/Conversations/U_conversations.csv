"Nothing as changed with the fundamentals of Unity but only getting better. Yesterday we had several bad things. Facebook outage,interest rates speck going higher,and CEO selling his planned years every month.Unity will bounce to fill the gap and with earnings coming soon it will prove that the market cap will get justified.Metaverse is not early but gaining mono. UNITY will be $250 by end of 2022."
"NICE we broke the 150 residence, congrats longs"
They had some interesting insights about U on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I’m back at 690% gain on my $170 leaps I took my profit and keeping some to see if I get 10x on those that would be amazing 
Jobs report coming today…
Shouldn't be any supply chain issues here. Safe Haven Stock with Huge Upside!
"who are they going to link up with for payments, Stripe?? Any thoughts?"
so glad I doubled my position yesterday at 11am.
"To those who listened, you're welcome once again."

"Jester, based in your posts it seems you have made good money, and I am glad you made money. Well brother, now our time has come to make money and enjoy this premier company for many years to come. Remember, SHOP, ANAZON, APPLE etc. U will join that league in making its investors rich beyond their imagination. It all has been a great entertainment among us. Good luck to all."

Huge opportunity right here today
Where is Jester . Did the nursing home cut off his internet access?
"Need some vote of confidence , Will unity ever reach 170 again? Otherwise Im selling and not looking back"
Snow Crash and the miraculous fictitious trades!

Welp tomorrow could be the break out :)
"As a developer, Unity is one of the best platforms to work with. It's UX is one of the best. As the platform starts to spread to other industries outside of gaming, it will grow and scale well because of its usability. Unity reminds me of Adobe in the early 2000s."
Today will see 90
I like the future of this company but the stock is to high right now. I will start purchasing under $125
Metaverse is 5 to 7 years away according to Facebook and analysts who cover the sector. This is not even remotely a near term catalyst to buy the stock. A lot of the froth will come out of the shares in the meantime
150 today
"What if they can develop a 3rd store? apple play, Google play....Unity Play?"
Well back to $140 hopefully this holds
"@Jester, Bull, Bear, or just a swing trade here? Small position @125. Looking for more. Insider selling, 5.45% - short, and lack of profit are concerning. Quality of product and asset growth look tremendous. Pullback under $100 looks like a reach. What price target do you like to add? Thanks"
what is happening? I am long here for almost a year don't pay attention to the news though.
Any thoughts for Unity to challenge Autodesk at some point in the future? I understand autodesk has a wide moat.
Does Unity benefit from new Apple MacBook Pro’s
Expect Jester and other shorts to start showing up as over the last few weeks Short position has increased from 2.2 days to 4.4 days. Highest position I have ever seen is 4.8 days.
