Am buying more
I think it's going now!
The conversion of fossil fuel to clean energy is the best possible answer now and into the future. Eventually FuelCell will be recognized as a leader to that goal. Patience is best for those so invested.
Should be $25 atleast.
"Latest short interest #'s... 56,162,162 shares short. LOL"
"another missed opportunity: ""SK E&S Co., the energy unit of South Korean conglomerate SK Group, said Wednesday it will team up with US fuel cell maker Plug Power Inc. to make a foray into the Asian hydrogen market."""
"Today's DD yielded some neat projects.. Found on the USPTO website are 2021 patent applications/updates for FCEL pertaining to efficiency upgrades via monitor and controls (APPLICATION# 17/198771), and advancement of CO2 capture from the Hydrogen producing steam-methane reforming process (APPLICATION# 17/194597). Both of these applications can extend unit life, increase ROI, and is the result of continuous R&D. I especially like the Pressure-Swing gas recovery as that is what my profession for the last 20 years has been. Also, they appear to be moving into a more modular approach which creates additional value for customer and company.From Energy.gov, ""Reforming low-cost natural gas can provide hydrogen today for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as well as other applications. Over the long term, DOE expects that hydrogen production from natural gas will be augmented with production from renewable, nuclear, coal (with carbon capture and storage), and other low-carbon, domestic energy resources.""They are still fueling the rocket, we have decades of advancement and competition ahead of us.I welcome any additional DD whether good or bad!!"
and now another push!
"Hm, to Chase or not to chase that is the question. The true bear would wait for their mark and if they didn't get it they wouldn't buy they would move on and wait for signals that it's pulling back after a substantial gain, still to only pull back to a higher low and lose out on substantial profit potential. Can't watch it go to 8 or $9 then decide to Chase. Hm, maybe should have made a move yesterday or this morning after signals were pointing to a probable bullish move with pretty strong signs of support in the $6 range. Awful nice to have confidence in what you're talking about with tons of facts to support it."
"Day 74 of the great fcel pump and dump negative cash flow sell off is in the books. It managed to get above the pivot nicely today but couldn't hold it and closed just above it , but its a long long way to 1st resistance at 7.95. I am betting on some downward action the next few days. Do your diligence like barry none is always pumping and you will see this thing is over priced by about 6.00$."
tick tock….almost time that they have to pay the South Korean piper…
"3 points, 1 massive volume out the gate and we broke $7 quickly I expect to hold support well over yesterday's support level of $6.70. 2) I've noticed at least one persistent bear expressing open-mindedness about a change in momentum or interest in the sector and or the company. That expression gives them more credibility when pushing their agenda. They can always reference back to it and say they were correct because it's blatantly obvious there's been a shift in interest. No one can deny it only the bulls have been pointing that out for over a week and it was denied. Just like the professional analysts late to the game.As I've been saying, tick tock. 3) I noted about a week ago we would be getting news updates and PR from all four of the big fuel cell companies in the coming weeks. I believe I referenced at least positive news update or PR per week is expected. At least three positive PR or updates from FCEL in less than 4 weeks."
"Volume/SP, both going up at the same time couldn't be a healthier picture. Up over 20% in the past week and rising while volume rises also. Yesterday we were up to 7.5 million shares one hour into the day and today volume is substantially higher over 11.5M 1 hour into the day. And bulls were pounding the table last week about buying at/under $6 while bears were in deep denial. I referenced at least 1 PR per week coming from the big 4 fuel cell companies and we've exceeded that over the past 2 weeks. Now the 3 PR from FuelCell Energy coming within the next 3.5 weeks. $8 opens the flood gates to test 200 day MA, 1st good PR should push past it. Tick tock!"
"Fcel is accumulated the shares, hold tight longs."

Let the games begin people
"Good news bagholders..The fcel negative cash flow pump and dump sell off came to an end today but just barely. I guess after 75 days of hard selling by the company they got tired of my daily reporting on their nasty ATM habit. As for a Rotation momentum into the sector as some are calling this latest DCB ,time will tell. It will be interesting if they can manage to keep pumping it to suckers and conning them into buying this one dollar stock at such inflated prices. Ofcorse with paid pumpers managing the message boards and defective products and other games they play...They might have a chance , But I for one will never hold this bag, just day trade it."
"Senates passed the votes, the default on oct 18th will not likely to happen. The negotiations of bills will be agreed, hydrogens will be replaced by oils, Fcel may have positive net income in a few quarters. The loss is so small compared to the cash to grow in 10 years. Make your own research. Do not let shorts scare you by old stories. Good luck to longs."
$fcel holding $7 strong. Looks like a future support level. If we can hold this soon we might see $8-9
"From previous linkAnd FuelCell Energy is commercializing its molten carbonate fuel cell, which can capture flue gas carbon while generating additional electricity from natural gas.It’s an exciting time for technology development, the ITC’s Morris says. “Decarbonization is going to be very, very difficult, and it’s probably not going to be possible without technologies that are currently in the development stage.”STATE OF PLAYCarbon capture is in its early days, especially for combustion flue gas, such as the emissions of a coal-fired power plant. Researchers are working on each of the technologies below to make them cheaper and more efficient and to get them to work on a wider variety of gas streams. A single commercial-scale installation could let a new technology pass its competitors or even take the lead."
"Well boys had to take a little profit today at $7.75 and move over to Gevo for the next run! I can see $10,00 in the near term over there."
2.5M shares at 9.35 I'd say heavy and likely higher than yesterday. Increased volume with increased SP 2 days in a row should be a sign of bull push in my humble opinion. Add Friday and it's definite.Might actually be at least one analyst that catches that and raises their share price Target. Should anyway shouldn't they? And as I was typing and checked the volume and share price to refer to the beginning of the week I noticed the day traders were starting to take profit. In the volume spiked to over 3 million in less than 3 minutes. Quick drop to $6.72 now moving back up. And over 3.5M 10 minutes after I began my post. Lol
"Volume I believe was around 29m yesterday, almost hit 30M and as volume rose the 3rd day in a row, so the Share price rose. Stock only goes down when volume goes down. Largely related to momentum and day-traders. Correlates with # of watchers also. Watchers rising now, and were steady for a while, then began dropping about a week ago, then began increasing again a couple days ago. Volume should average 30+M over the next 4 weeks, which should bode well for the SO."
Short interest last year was 45M shares.... current is 56M. Last year took the pps to 29... what happens to shorts this time?
Dont panic and help the shorts. Hold it. We will end the day in green. Shorts are done.
Groton news?

"Rosneft, ExxonMobil to explore low carbon technologies such as hydrogenRussian oil company Rosneft has teamed up with ExxonMobil to explore low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen as a means to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.This has been made official through the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU).Through this agreement, the two companies will consider the prospect of new projects focused on carbon capture, utilisation and storage as well as the development of fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia.In doing so, the companies are exploring various different avenues in regard to zero emission technologies and, with hydrogen listed, it could benefit from this agreement.It is also believed that the MoU serves as a signal of intent from both companies to reduce their carbon footprint."
Skyrocketing uncontrolled operational costs..with oil/natural gas on the rise…it cuts deeper into FCEL because of all of their MCFC platforms’ dependence on a supply of NG..
"Hydrogen is about to start a bull run, seat belt, do not the price shaking you down, keep some for your future, this is the 10 years investments. The price is bottom out. Down side 1$, the upside is so huge to who to be patient."
"FCEL Today Great News: DANBURY, Conn., Sept. 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FuelCell Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL), a global leader in fuel cell technology — with a purpose of utilizing its proprietary, state-of-the-art fuel cell platforms to enable a world empowered by clean energy — applauds California Governor Gavin Newsom on the signing of Senate Bill 155, which includes a two-year extension of the Fuel Cell Net Energy Metering program, known as Fuel Cell NEM. This bill represents an enormous investment in alleviating the effects of climate change in California through environmental protection, extreme heat mitigation, coastal restoration, and wildfire prevention. Governor Newsom’s July emergency proclamation signaled that California needs all available tools at the ready to ensure that California’s electrical grid remains resilient in the face of extreme demand, heat and supply constraints. The clean, always-on power that fuel cells provide will deliver much needed energy, environmental, and public health benefits. Extending the Fuel Cell NEM program will provide California customers certainty that investing in and deploying clean baseload alternative energy sources is in the best interest of the state as a whole and consistent with the state’s environmental objectives.“Fuel Cell NEM allows businesses to invest their own private capital in clean, firm technology that reduces their energy consumption and lowers their environmental footprint by reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, while the State benefits from maintaining and creating new jobs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, criteria air pollutants and water use without any direct incentives,” said Jason Few, President and Chief Executive Officer, FuelCell Energy, Inc. “Again, we thank Governor Newsom and the California Legislature for supporting energy and climate policy that furthers the State’s ambition for reliable baseload power, clean energy investments, job creation and environmental protection.”The Fuel Cell NEM program allows customers that install fuel cell systems up to five megawatts onsite to be relieved from paying standby and departing load charges imposed by California’s investor-owned utilities. The relief from these charges and the use of onsite generation through this program allows California customers to stabilize their energy costs, neutralize the instability that at times plagues the California grid and negatively impacts their business operations, and invest in clean, firm energy technology."

"How does a company with no profits, delayed projects, questionable financings, no real news, continue to gain? It make no sense. None what so ever."

"Protonic Ceramics for Ammonia Transportation Fuels ARPA-E ProjectProgram: REFUELAward: $4,600,000Location: Danbury, ConnecticutStatus: ACTIVEProject Term: 05/22/2017 - 09/30/2021Critical Need: ""Most liquid fuels used in transportation today are derived from petroleum and burned in internal combustion engines. This combination is attractive because of the high energy density of the fuels and current economics, but it remains partially reliant on imported petroleum and is highly carbon intensive. Alternatives to internal combustion engines, such as fuel cells that convert chemical energy to electricity, have shown promise in vehicle powertrains, but are hindered by inefficiencies in fuel transport and storage. Carbon-neutral liquid fuels (CNLFs), such as ammonia, used in conjunction with fuel cells, offer an alternative transportation system that addresses these challenges. These fuels can be produced by converting water and air using chemical or electrochemical processes powered by renewable electricity. The resulting CNLFs can be stored and transported using existing liquid fuels infrastructure to the point-of-use. However, there are technical challenges associated with converting CNLFs to hydrogen for use in conventional fuel cells or directly to electricity. Advanced materials such as membranes and catalysts and new electrochemical processes are required to efficiently generate hydrogen or electricity from energy-dense CNLFs at higher conversion rates and lower costs.""Project Innovation + Advantages: ""FuelCell Energy will develop an advanced solid oxide fuel cell system capable of generating ammonia from nitrogen and water, and renewable electricity. The unique design will also allow the system to operate in reverse, by converting ammonia and oxygen from air into electricity. A key innovation in this project is the integration of proton-conducting ceramic membranes with new electride catalyst supports to enable an increase in the rate of ammonia production. Combining their catalyst with a calcium-aluminate electride support increases the rate of ammonia formation by reducing coverage of the catalyst surface by hydrogen and allowing the nitrogen to use all of the catalyst area for reactions. The modular nature of this system allows for its deployment closer to the point of use at agricultural and industrial sites, working to both produce ammonia for immediate or delayed use and to use the ammonia to generate electricity after it has been transported to population centers.""Potential Impact:If successful, developments from REFUEL projects will enable energy generated from domestic, renewable resources to increase fuel diversity in the transportation sector in a cost-effective and efficient way.FuelCell Energy | arpa-e.energy.govhttp://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/protonic-ceramics-ammonia"

"I'm absolutely certain that over the next several months let's say no later than March several things happen. 1) the bears end up with absolutely zero valid reasons for the share price to go lower and we see a lot of different names of bears start popping up on the message boards, changed names!! 2) the share price ends up significantly higher than the previous 52 week high. 3) backlog is increased substantially I would say by at least 100%. 4) we have achieved EBIDTA + and will sustain that moving forward. 5) Derby will be added to Generation revenue totaling 65.9MW approximately $70 million recurring Revenue. 6) We will have officially announced at least one new project in Canada and in Europe. 7) Few will be on CNBC and have Kramer's backing! 8) we will have at least 2 separate CC projects under contract! 9) At least 1 big surprise no one saw coming. 10) I will be retired, doing whatever the hell I want and loving the fact that people expressing skepticism about me and Fuel Cell Energy were dead wrong."

He says thank you to all of the long - past, present and future."
"Volume ReferenceI refer to volume often because it's important. Volume patterns are just as important as share price patterns if not more so. Volume was averaging about 300,000 pre-market by 9:30 a.m. throughout the last month of the downturn. We are at 440,000 at 7:30 a.m. and we are up substantially. That's a huge difference in volume after already being up over 20% in the past six days. Volume is off to a good start yesterday and slowed down not even hitting 20 million. Although 20 million is a substantially increase over the less than 15 million average in the last month of the downturn. Tick tock"
"Actually, it is very encouraging that it showed strength in today's market.

"Market Cap recap! As of closingBE $3.8B $22.08BLDP. $4.8B $16.12FCEL. $2.7B $7.25PLUG. $19.3B $33.59FuelCell Energy is clearly the lowest Share price and Market cap. This will change. Currently 71% of Bloom, 56% Ballard and less than 14% Plug. IMO, we breeze past BE and BLDP by sometime next n November."
"FCEL's 5th split took place on May 09, 2019. This was a 1 for 12 reverse split, meaning for each 12 shares of FCEL owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 1 share. For example, a 500 share position pre-split, became a 41.6666666666667 share position following the split.

"Trading volumes are higher than average and the price trend has been rising, in general, since the publication of the financial statements.Totally encouraging, not for the faint of heart ...."
Read Nones’ posts back in July.. he speculates that FCEL would be in the 25.00 price point…huh?
Interesting that all of the other green energy stocks are up 4 to 7 % today and this one fcel the cheapest one is only up 2%.. That should tell you something.
Shorts are hurting so my guess is they start posting overtime.

Andy is going to be on mad money tonight pumping. That combined with options activity we should close over $7.50 at some point this week easily. If we happen to get good news from the federal government could even close over $9 this week. My $9 options are looking pretty good for November 12th right now.

"Some people monitor stocks very close. The only way to see and understand what I'm talking about is if you have done this with FuelCell Energy. The trading pattern today is very different than the down days. On the down days you can see a number of large sell orders trying to drive the share price down. How hard they work at manipulation varies some days they can have up to 20 large sell orders. Today's pattern on a strong day of similar volume or greater, the trading is much more consistent. Volume is typical for this time of day but my opinion is that it will continue at these levels throughout the day and not slack off as in the down days. Will certainly find out soon enough in the next couple of hours"

Can someone tell me what the proprietary technology that FCEL has and how it will harness an actual profit margin ?
Plug Power news lifting all hydrogen plays. Short squeeze.
"Peace of mind comes from rational saying thought process and acceptance of things beyond your control. Fortunately I'm confident that I have those qualities and I wish that for everyone. Which is related to my sharing on the boards. That said, the markets look stable, the other fuel cell stocks are down a fraction of what we are. Nothing has changed for the worse and many things have gotten better just look at the quarterly report. No reason at all for fcel and bloom ballard or plug today and in fact they are probably only down because fuel cell is down over 4%. Tick tock. Look at November 2019 and 2020 compared to September of 2019 and 2020. Expect something similar or even better I do."

"FuelCell Energy Went From Two Dollars To Twenty Dollars Before.Now We're Going From Six Dollars To Sixty Dollars, This Run-Up To Higher.This is simply ""How Stocks Move"" Folks!Enjoy my knowledge!"
The fundamentals say that FuelCell could be worth $600 million in a decade not $2 billion today.FCEL stock is worth just over a buck.
Against all the bashing I kept my few FCEL stocks. Glad I did that they are smashing it today.
I know on many occasions people have referenced our need to separate ourselves from the other fuel cell stocks and trade independently of Plug power. And I know yesterday my reply to somebody was that we would do that by the end of the year. End of the year came today. Done. That interview separated us. No one else does what we do. Few made that crystal clear and benzinga backed it.
"Never BS anyone, life's too short and my motto is treat others as you would want to be treated so I try. Everyone has a cap though. Lol. Anyway, I have now bought my beautiful new home and my Harley with ""profits"" from FuelCell Energy. I have my boat and trailer to go, then retirement. Tick tock. Sold a total of 12,000 shares on the run to $29. But bought 8 thousand for short term gains I knew were coming the 2 months leading up to it. Just as I warned. I specified ""by the beginning of November"". And since it went higher than expected, I sold 4,000 extra. Got back those 4,000 and now I'm back to 4,500 extra for this November. Tick tock!"

There's reference to that on the Canadian natural website. They are using new technologies to achieve net zero, which have been proven in the Netherlands. They also obviously work with Exxon Mobil. They also reference from an article in May, using the technology they are most comfortable with and familiar with, a 1.4MW MCFC. Happy hunting.https://www.oilsandspathways.ca/"
Takeoff
"just added to average down, hope she got time to climb today"
"We basically have the answer we just don't know exactly how much it will benefit fuel cell. On an updated note looks like we have a shot at breaking 30 million shares again today on a significant update. All indicators point to go. Heavy volume new 30 day high, substantially past the 50-day moving average one week after an excellent quarterly report and a positive piece on the internet from a third party. $10 call options activity for January is definitely a bonus, I expect they will be in the money shortly with the 200-day moving average around $11. Just in time for me to sell some shares for the closing on my house which I bought at an average price of about $6.50. got to love it when a plan comes together"
Watching this closely for the last 20 minutes thinking there's no way this is going to trade between 680 and 685 for the rest of the day it's got a break below or over. Slowly we hit 86 then 87. I get the impression she's ready to burst through $7. Especially given people know fog is going on a rant tonight. Either way 680 is showing support right now. If we hold that support level through tomorrow then we definitely close over $7 today or tomorrow. Our real test is not #$%$ $7.60 or thereabouts.
Time for FCEL to bounce back to the $30.'s.
I am hold because too many people come here to advice selling.
What is the reason for the rise yesterday at the end of trading and today before trading?
"Shorts, this is your best attempt? 56M shorts should be pressing harder."
"Imagine. Knowing that hydrogen is the future and it's already a reality, but not buying the stock and watching how it goes to the moon with time. I will not be surprised if this stock hits $100-$200 in 2022 or 2023."
Okay so I ended up being wrong yet again. But in reality was I really. We were down about 25 cents when I suggested if we did hit 30 million we would end up green. Did turn green right as we hit 30. And really the idea is that the heavy volume is showing to be a positive thing. After being up substantially over the past 1 to 2 weeks and plug in the other fuel cell stocks dropping much more than we did today to end up down fractionally is a very positive thing.
Will be above 8$ today

300 % down from the old high why is it negative on here
"I have the utmost confidence the share price pop this morning is related to the California bill. Much more to come without Fuel Cell Energy even releasing any positive company updates. But that will come also. The timing could end up being perfect. We get momentum rolling from local government like California, then more momentum from the federal government, then boom! Groton and Yaphank follows before the dust settles. And I will reiterate my opinion about Toyota. I do believe Toyota is running slightly behind what I previously expected. I'm thinking COD more like January or possibly even February. However, I'm optimistic about Derby in February or March. Although Toyota is extremely high profile, Derby is the most immediate Big money Maker. $15+M per yr RECURRING REVENUE!"
Is there a reason for the rise in the share price in recent days?
Looks like it's about ready to run. Big boys jumping on ship. Humble opinion: Short Term Target price: $10.
Sooooooooooo Saps what do you think will happen to the share price when Pew has to writeoff Groton?????????????????????? My guess is that it is on the books for $30 MILLION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good thing Pew raised $450 MILLION by Diluting you Saps last quarter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chill and love life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep Stuffing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Can't quite pinpoint it. Is that fear I smell or news? We'll find out by 5:00 if it's news. Won't you look at that, we topped 30M shares in the green, as I stated confidently around $7 under 20M shares over a couple hours ago! There was a farmer had a dog, tick tock!"
pipeline bust under ocean - massive oil spill- major danger -yet environmentalist kept blind eye- FCEL PLUG IS THE ANSWER - move over fast save the planet

"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"Price predictions & comments. Ever come to think people talking about buying back in at $6 or $5 are wishing they did that 2 weeks ago? Or even $6.50 a week ago. $7.30 at 4am. Up over 10 from a week ago and 20% from 2 weeks ago. Told ya so. Still not too late. Remember $29.44, the old high in 7 weeks."
"FCEL revenue is increasing (and recurring), Expected milestone to increase revenue by year end is still pending... get your seats now kids!Higher cost from inflation; name a similar company that has not experienced delays and increased cost this year. FuelCell is adjusting and still beat Q3 estimates. Now that Groton has had their official promotion ceremony we should have people on site to finalize commissioning. A great finish to FY 2021 or start to FY 2022, the revenue will get yet another boost on project completion and service down the road. If they fail to deliver in October I will buy the dip and hold. add a $1B+ backlog and a bank full of cash... Yes please!"
"guys stop talking non-sens. FCEL is a great mid long term. in 5 years will trade over 100, short term around 25-30 between end year and january. Green energy is the future and FCEL is just starting"
Carbon capture storage is one of Fuelcells strong business segments but they do have many more.
$10.00 is coming
Tomorrow opening above $7 would be nice. If we can destroy some sell walls $8 is not a surprise.
Soon back to $10!
"Shorts, you are making a big mistake to bet against big guys, the more you short, the more money they will take from you. Following the trend."
"First off I’m long FCEL but I worry about getting to excited about their near term success to young investors. Their past annual revenue is 26 million. The average American auto dealership generated 60 million. Almost all of their revenue is generated over seas. I have to believe Covid related travel will be a challenge to their increase of revenues. I believe With 300 employees a measurable increase will be extremely difficult. It’s a great concept and with Nat.Gas reaching $30 per thousand BTU in Europe it could be part of their solution. But I’ve wondered why didn’t Exxon buy then when they were $2. They had to be close to them with their carbon collection partnership.Buyer beware on this one I’ve been there for twenty years, progress has been difficult."
Is this going to be another typical short attack moment? $7.85 and now $7.56. Even with this high volume it just can't seem to stay up for long. Although I admit fcel is on a uphill climb. Here's to forcing shorts to start covering and forcing fcel upward.
beautiful....

"Volume/SP hypothesis! We broke 7.5 million shares in the first hour and have traded less than that over the next 4 hours. We have a much higher support level today than we did yesterday. We also broke $7 quickly this morning after the market opened. Those indicators combined with news that's been coming in and the interest in the sector, it's my opinion that volume will pick up near the end of the day and we will rise likely closing close to $7 or over $7. To be more specific over $6.90. more importantly, we should have a higher high and a higher low tomorrow. Just my opinion. I never give investing advice. Do your own diligence blah blah blah."
is she making a V shape
12:06 EST..it looks to me it might have difficulty staying in the Irish today… but I should defer to the roofing analyst with the MBA degree from Home Depot..
"Now, we just wait for a press release from Fuel Cell applauding the JP Morgan report. Big news!!"
Above 8$ anytime
Toyota Mirai has set an official Guinness World Record for the longest distance by a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle without refuelling. The 2021 Mirai achieved 845 miles on a single tank.
The latest news is bigger than most people think. FCEL is headed back to $20. Clean energy will continue to remain a top priority and other states will follow with similar initiatives.
"Lol, bid $6.64 ask $6.66 did the math and figured it's not worth waiting I need the money to be available on Monday and I only needed to cash 300 shares. I figured the only way it was worth waiting was if I waited for a dollar and that's probably not likely to happen by tomorrow which is when I need to cash by anyway. Rather than push time I decided to place a sell order on 300 shares at $6.65, which generally does not feel very quickly, especially since I was at $6.65 (over current bid). Trade filled as soon as I click the button. People are waiting or trying to scoff up shares as quickly as possible at these levels. Should be rebounding tomorrow and unless we go to $7.50 quickly I won't be disappointed about selling my 300 shares. Unless someone can explain to me how my order filled immediately during extended hours selling over bid. I've got all my cash for closing now."
"...of course FuelCell Energy is going to have to bottom-out and then rally up to new 52-week highs real soon again.this is because ALL TIME new highs are coming here.(i do not make these ""calls"" very often but when i see it it is 100% inevitable)"
It is flying high.
I respect Dewey’s analysis of FCEL SP..but I think he misses the dollar target by .25…my math has it about .75-.77..He’s probably trying to be nice to those who’ve taken a beating…
bull run..back to 30 the future is here.
"FCel is 8$ without any catalyst, with physical infrastructure, it will be above 10$ and going up. I will not sell a single share until 8$, and will never sell all my fcel holding."
This company is been running on PLUG coat tails for the last 2 years
Same event happening!!!! Up over $.40 and slowly deteriorating. This happens every time. I personally think this is maniplation at the worst.
"Kids will be kids, this is kids with a lot of money playing around right now. Volume is higher this morning than normal and higher than recently in the first hour. However my opinion is that if we hit 30 million shares today we close in the green. They're just taking profit and trying to shake things up so they can trade it."
"This was 8/12, almost 7 weeks ago. Siting/construction & tie ins are complete.

$8 we go now!
"As of July 31, 2021, FCEL’s total order backlog declined 2.2% from its year-ago value to $1.30 billion. Its Advanced Technologies backlog fell 23% from $51.89 million on July 31, 2020, to $40.03 million as of July 31, 2021. This can be attributed primarily to a decrease in fuel pricing, which has reduced its estimated fuel revenue. A declining backlog suggests that the company is not gaining new contracts. Bleak Financials"
Hopefully Closing @ 8 today
On its way back to 25$! 
39 days in my ideal situation of the stock going up between 3:00 and 5% a day. At an average of 4% a day that's how many days it would take to break the 52-week high. That's how many days from yesterday's close. Which actually makes sense TimeWise with the incoming news expected. Although I will make another guarantee there's no way it goes up between 3:00 and 5% every day. Just look at today for example. We already blew that theory.
I wonder if this uptick will stick?
Shorts are losing momentum.
Is there a better way to manage methane and add to revenue than by putting it through fuel cells to make power?
Upgrade coming
FCEL: Looking for strong close and opening tomorrow. $7.50 is coming. This is way under valued.
"FCEL is a company ahead of the times,very much like the Wright Brothers! We have had the tech and others didn't know. We have been perfecting it (CC, and electrolysis).XOM & FCEL have been perfecting CCUS with fuel cells since at least 2014.

Beautiful cup N handle 
"Like I said bears are going to have a very difficult time trying to keep beating this down. Government incentives already kicked in with more coming soon. And there's no way each one of these companies isn't going to come out with good news over the coming weeks. If one comes out with good news the other stocks are not going to go down, that's not really an opinion it's a fact. That one won't go down while the other ones go up substantially. Doesn't happen that way. Bloom had good news today. I'm sure one of the other three is going to come out with Good News by next week. And fuel cell energy has at least three significant positive updates coming in the next 5 weeks."

Now we all know professional analyst don't know any more than we do, but we also know some people listen to them and know there will be a market reaction to what they say just based on the fact that they're making a press release many people will read. Ironically they upgraded bloom from Market perform to Strong by while at the same time lowering their price Target from 33 to 29.
