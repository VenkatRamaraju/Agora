$FCEL has a $12.00 upgrade. The current consensus among 10 polled investment analysts is to hold stock in Fuelcell Energy Inc.
Dewey and Turtle let me know when you need help with Margin Call. FCEL goes higher from here. Time to move on.
bloom has the best balance sheet among fuel cells companies.

"Everfuel will establish 19 new hydrogen filling stations in DenmarkThe Danish hydrogen company will establish 19 new hydrogen filling stations in Denmark, the company states.Christian Grunert Rantorp, @grunert_rantorp26 May 2021 11:15. Note: The article is more than 30 days old.There are very few of them, they are relatively expensive and there are very few places they can refuel. Compared to electric cars, the hydrogen cars are therefore still very exotic for the Danish consumer.But now it seems that hydrogen cars are getting a little easier to live with. Thus, the Danish company Everfuel states that the company will establish 19 new, strategically located hydrogen filling stations in Denmark.Until now, hydrogen drivers have only had a handful of locations to choose from throughout Denmark, including Esbjerg, Kolding, Aarhus and Korsør. Everfuel also plans to open a station on Amager in July.In March, we wrote that Everfuel would also launch 15 new stations in Norway, and Jacob Krogsgaard, director and founder of Everfuel, also says in a press release that Everfuel aims to “sell hydrogen on a large scale to ensure a green transition. of transport in Scandinavia ”.Hydrogen from Hamburg to OsloEverfuel will invest a total of one and a half billion euros in developing a network of hydrogen filling stations in Europe by 2030. The Scandinavian part of the network will initially have to cover Norway south of Trondheim, Sweden south of Stockholm and thus also Denmark.The network is part of an initiative in which the political corridor collaboration 'String' is involved. Among the members are Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Region Zealand, the Capital Region, Copenhagen, Malmö, Region Skåne and Oslo, which are working to establish and utilize a traffic corridor between Oslo and Hamburg, including via the upcoming Fehmarn connection.And here, therefore, enough infrastructure must be established for hydrogen vehicles, so that the need can be covered from Hamburg in the south to Oslo in the north.Typically, it is electric cars that we refer to when we talk about zero-emission cars, but hydrogen is thus also officially counted when Denmark sets a target of one million low- and zero-emission cars by 2030.So far, however, the market for hydrogen cars has not been large. Among the exceptions are models like the Honda Clarity, Hyundai Nexo and Toyota Mirai. The latter costs half a million kroner on Danish number plates.Hydrogen cars in CopenhagenAlmost 10 years ago, the City of Copenhagen signed a contract with Hyundai to supply 15 hydrogen cars of the type ix35 FCEV, which can still be spotted in the Copenhagen cityscape. Here, most hydrogen cars of the Toyota brand will probably also belong to the taxi company Drivr, which has several hydrogen cars in its fleet.But the fact that it is difficult to get ordinary motorists to choose hydrogen cars may change a bit now if there are more places to fill them up. Because even though hydrogen cars are expensive to buy, they are still exempt from registration tax in Denmark, and the filling of hydrogen is equivalent to refueling a conventional car, while the range of a tank full is long: 650 kilometers in a Toyota Mirai. How the hydrogen is then produced, and whether it is worth investing in a world with more and more electric cars, is a different story.Toyota is highlighted in the press release from Everfuel, where the company's director Alar Metsson welcomes investments in infrastructure for Japanese cars.Where the first new stations will be located, Everfuel will not unveil until later in the year."

"A meager 15.2M more needed to meet FY2020 revenue. we invoiced more than that Q4 2020 (during Covid)revenue increasing, technology developing, gas & oil price skyrocketing, coal power polluting, my money says this is a long term win that will feed my family through retirement"
"FCEL is a Friday stock, let's run up after hour today"
"FCEL, HYSR, PLUG way undervalued share price! Bright green future on the horizon for those companies business and their shares price! LONG FCEL, HYSR, PLUG!"
Eventually when this stock reaches 10 please do not say I told you so!!! People and their charts and graphs

"From early bird.....FuelCell Energy Stock is Rising from the Ashes""Hydrogen fuel cell technology provider FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ: FCEL) stock put in a bottom after falling more than (-75%) off its yearly highs of $20.97 made in February 2021. The pandemic winner was lifted on the clean and renewable energy hype and momentum driven momentum from the global decarbonization initiatives. As reality hit, shares collapsed to a low of $5.34 on Sept. 13, 2021. Shares have begun their climb back as the recent Q3 2021 earnings underscored a return to growth in its power generation segment. The Company also raised nearly $369 million in net proceeds from the sale of stock to bolster its cash to nearly half a billion in the quarter."""
PLUG has amazing growth avenues with projected +60% 2022. Bloom will play a bit of catch up as the deals come in a with the deserved recognition. The 4.5 billion SK over the next three years alone will bring in 1.5 billion in yearly Bloom revenues. All fuel cell stocks are in for huge appreciation but I have my money on BE getting to a share price of 100 first fairly valued still behind the market cap behind the Wall Street favorite PLUG. This could happen sooner than you think possibly in the current squeeze.The reason for BEs outperformance is startling when looking at revenues compared to huge growth for all the fuel cell players2022 revenue projections vs market cap$BE 1.2 billion w/ 5.7 billion market cap$PLUG 0.8 billion w/ 21 billion market cap$BLDP 0.145 billion w/ 4.6 billion market cap$FCEL 0.12 billion w/ 2.93 billion market cap
ExxonMobil ramps up 4X spending on low carbon business. Looks like their all switching. It's just a matter of time before FCEL is back into the 20's. My target price: $15 per share in the near future.

FCEL has less than a $3B market cap. Compare to Plug's $22B. Which one is relatively cheaper to buy? I think a $10B market cap is both reasonable and attainable for FCEL within the next year.
Sector rotation has begun. Expect FCEL and all hydrogen and green energy plays to make a significant run through the remainder of the year. Good luck to all

"Exxon Mobil keen to build carbon storage hubs in SE Asia, similar to Houston projectBy Florence TanSINGAPORE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp wants to build carbon capture storage (CCS) hubs in Southeast Asia, similar to its project in Houston, Texas, and has started talks with some countries with potential storage options for carbon dioxide, the company's head of low carbon solutions said.Last month, the U.S. energy major said 11 companies have agreed to begin discussing plans that could lead to capturing and storing up to 50 million tonnes per year (tpy) of CO2 in the Gulf of Mexico by 2030 ""Unlike in Houston, the storage capacity here is not close to the areas with the highest emissions,"" ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions President Joe Blommaert said at the Singapore International Energy Week.""That's why we've been studying the concept of placing CO2 capture hubs in some of Asia's heavy industrial areas such as here in Singapore and then connecting them to CO2 storage locations elsewhere in the region."""
