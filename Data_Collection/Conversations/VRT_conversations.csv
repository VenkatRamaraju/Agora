I love what's going on with this company. But the market doesn't care what I think. It appears they won't be issuing any shares to buy E&I. Management said orders remain strong during the most recent presentation. This acquisition also puts Vertiv into critical power management in hospitals and warehouses. Biggest concern and I'm sure the bulk of the questions during the upcoming earnings call q&a will be towards supply chain issues. When supply chain issues clear up I believe this is going to new highs in a hurry. October 27th should be interesting.
buy the dip.
Seems this acquisition expands VRT beyond just data center into power distribution systems for industrial and health care facilities.
Hoping to buy back in around $22..when do you think this stock will pop off? I’m thinking this is a hold and wait for years
"VRT isn't the only company warning about margins. The market is gigantically overvalued, and expectations that profits and margins will keep improving are unrealistic at this point. A correction for the market is needed, big time. Many are predicting late fall. Eitherway, VRT is providing warning like many other companies currently are. A good healthy correction to remove the froth would be beneficial over the long run. Buy the dips."
Nice follow through on yesterday's earnings move. Up a little over 4% with good volume.
are the hedge funds selling? 
Wow.. this went south real quick.3 days of huge volumes of selling.. charts damaged.
The merger makes it easier to get to $2 EPS in the next 3 years.
manipulation
@Mason I am not buying. Earnings are too close and I need to hear what they have to say about supply chain issues. I'm in at a great price and have a great profit. Patience is best for me right now.
Nice to see a bounce today on a mostly red market day. Volume slightly above average.
"Earnings is tomorrow, any predictions?"
E&I acquisition complete a month ahead of expectations.
"Wish I bought when you did Dennis way back sub $10. Haven’t checked in on this stock for awhile. Seems like 22 is a pretty fair price for me to buy in at, what do you think? Are you buying more at these levels?"
I see no indication VRT will be issuing shares for the purchase of E&I. So when the supply chain issues clear up and acquisition is complete this should be way undervalued. Still wondering if a share buyback is possible. Earnings on 10/27 according to Schwab.
Dave Cote is not an IT guru. Honeywell could run itself
"technical wise, whats the support line?"
How long will chain of supply be affected? There is always information missing when companies comment.
Five percent off all time highs and green on a terrible market day. This has that beach ball under water feeling. Just need the market to improve.
Analyst commented Rob Johnson's commentary was meaningfully more positive than just a month ago. I agree with this . Seems the whole teams comments are focused on working thru short term issues while staying focused on long term goals.
VRT to acquire E&I Engineering group for about $2 billion. Dave Cote calls it a 1+1=3 transaction. But they also lowered 2021 guidance because of supply chain issues. They called this supply issue temporary. Stock is down 5%.
what value add is this acquisition??
this just does not want to go past $28.
"Niceeee we reached a new ATH, looking forward to 30s soon."
Relentless selling. Wow!
Solid earnings report. 2022 looks like it will continue the growth pattern. A great core holding
its going to be fine!
Frustrating price action given the great earnings report but only about 6% off all time highs. My largest position and I'm sitting. I believe in Dave Cote. His track record speaks for itself.
Excellent opportunity.
been consoldating around 27 for past few weeks....what will be the catalyst?
Blackrock now a 5% owner in VRT.
I'll let the stock price settle for a few more days or even weeks then will consider buying a few shares on a weekly or bi weekly basis just to average in.
I'm wondering if management will consider a share buyback given the drop in price. There was $700 mil in cash at the last quarterly but some of that was used on the E&I acquisition.
Vertiv is up 4.90% to 25.90
Seems like this is destined for a test of the 200 day. Selling has been non stop. I'm guessing we need to get some improvement in supply chain issues to change the trend.
"Doesn't look like any additional stock will be issued for the acquisition. Plus I don't remember Powerbar being part of the original PR but may have missed it. ""Vertiv Holdings (VRT) said Wednesday that its unit Vertiv Group plans to commence a $850 million private placement of senior secured notes due 2028.Vertiv Group plans to use the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of Vertiv's proposed purchase of E&I Engineering Ireland and its affiliate, Powerbar Gulf LLC, and to pay fees and expenses related to the deal and the offering.""This going to be big when supply chain issues are cleared up."
Wait 2 weeks for this to hit $15
