This stock had a 5 handle recently. Anyone have any thoughts on odds it'll pullback and test that with an overall market retest as well?

I'm looking forward to that first merger/acquisition news.
"yes its a boring stock, price movement is like watching paint dry...but inching upwards...what a gem!solid company & market leader in each business segment they are in.i will hold this long term."
Three days of increasing volume at/near all time highs. Feels like we are getting ready for a substantial move higher. Looking forward to tomorrow.
Earnings November 4th. Morning after election....that should be fun.
Guidance for next quarter is .32-.35. I'm wondering if next year's guidance will increase but probably won't know until next quarter.
"JPMorgan Starts Vertiv Holdings at Overweight With $25 Price TargetVertiv Holdings (VRT) has an average rating of buy and price targets ranging from $24 to $30, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ."
Cramer lit the fuse in my opinion. His buy recommendation in the Lightning Round is just the start. Not trying to pump the stock but I was looking for something that would spark the stock price. Love him or hate him he has influence.
VRT earnings date May 5th. Conference call May 6th.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertiv-announces-date-first-quarter-123000010.html
Listened to one of the presentations Vertiv had over the last two weeks. It was interesting to learn how Dave Cote finally settled on Vertiv. After they put together the spac they started with around 300 companies. Whittled that down to ten then three and finally settled on Vertiv. Dave Cote said he was concerned with his legacy because of his success at Honeywell. He was ready to disband the spac and give the money back to investors if they couldn't find the right company.
8k filed.
what value add is this acquisition??
"technical charts wise, how is it looking for VRT?"
VRT is down 5.10% to 11.16
VRT closed the earnings gap. Hoping for some upside action from here.
such a fantastic sleeper pick not well known yet. in time this will take off. they're on the verge of becoming profitable. they'll get more analyst coverage soon.

Pretty impressive VRT is up today. Buyers stepped in aggressively on the initial drop today.
"I’m buying VRT today, hopefully I can get close to 20$ so all of you holding with 80% gains or 50% or 10% Are holding because you have a good feeling it’s going higher."
The merger makes it easier to get to $2 EPS in the next 3 years.
I always enjoy Dave Cote's conference call introductions. They are always positive and make you glad to be a shareholder.
VERT-UN reached an all time high at 16.50
Earnings release on 4/28. A little quicker than usual. I would not have expected it before May.
so what typically happens on day of earnings call? this will be my first experience.
This stock seems to often move opposite most of the market. Not sure why?
Two strong days right before earnings. Looking forward to tomorrow morning.
last ER missed a little bit because VRT workers literally could not gain access to sites due to the pandemic. this is going to get good attention when they flip to being a profitable company and a fantastic reopening play now that vaccines are being widely rolled out. they may provide bullish guidance next ER coming up.
Another all time closing high with earnings in two weeks. Let's make the run to $30.
Pre-mkt is juicy af.... 19.75.Welcome to all the new investors! This is probably one of the safest places to park your money.Cheers longs!
"I'm feeling really good about the prospects for VRT over the next five years. With Disney announcing a large number of Star Wars and Marvel spin off shows on their streaming platform, the need for Vertiv's products just grew significantly. The growing demand for data centers over the next decade puts all VRT holders in a position to win big time. As more and more investors are pouring money into volatile IPO's like DoorDash and Air B N B, I'm watching my money grow safely and steadily."
Vertiv management has the confidence to use over $3 million on a dividend. I'm really looking forward to the quarterly report.
I have a feeling this is going to take off next week
All time closing high. This has really sprang back with the markets.

Debt refinancing news announced today. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertiv-announces-completion-debt-refinancing-140200182.html
"So Platinum will get around $340M for their time and money into it, and still keeping most shares. The only downside is temporary selling pressure while the position is liquidated, unless they happen to have a prearranged buyer for their shares￼. My take is that those shares will be available for trading increasing the float. Which is probably something we could use (along with some PR). Has anyone else noticed how this thing behaves PM and AH? Constantly pegging hard to round dollars and the .50 marks(or well close enough). Odd af.Also, I think we can all agree that platinum‘s equity position is pretty outsized. I don’t mind seeing their stake reduced as they’re basically investors just looking for some ROI. I don’t know if they have a history of being activist investors or not, that would be something to look into.￼"
Love VRT. This sleeper is going to make me wealthy on the long hold.
strong Q4 results?
"With regards to possible acquisitions/growth, I have a few thoughts.I pored over their 10-K filings thoroughly when I first did my DD. It was identified that they have very favorable borrowing conditions, also called ""restrictive covenants."" Interestingly enough, they have a unique feature not commonly seen known as ""fallaways."" As it was explained to me, as they perform better in terms of their business - mainly EPS, free cash flow, etc. - they have greater latitude to use the funds as they see fit, and as earnings increase, their borrowing capacity increases. I don't have the time to find the specifics again but I invite all investors to read it.VRT is just breaking into positive EPS territory. The trajectory is up - we've got a huge backlog of orders, no cancellations. They are taking their time to improve cash flow (increased their free cash flow to $62M this past Q) and there seems to be an emphasis on keeping fixed costs constant. So I'm not looking for any major moves until mid-2021 at the earliest. More restructuring to come in Q3. It seems like its a lot of financial housekeeping tbh."
"its a steal, current price if compared to others in this sector...market leader in critical infrastructure space."
I keep buying the dips :)
Jim is about talking about VRT right now!
Nice to see a bounce today on a mostly red market day. Volume slightly above average.

Found this. Ever cool :)https://www.total-croatia-news.com/business/47007-vertiv
Very positive earnings call. Everyone should listen. Basically what I'm hearing is orders are very strong but completing these orders has been challenging because of supply chain and access to facilities. Customers haven't been cancelling orders and they don't expect that to happen. Dave Cote had a very positive message to begin the call.
It could be that VRT went public in order to find fair value for company . HON very well may have approached before went public . Clearly they are a good fit .
VRT reached a 52 Week high at 16.83
Vertiv has three conferences coming up before the end of the month.https://investors.vertiv.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx
"People thinking guidance was overly conservative, to try to set a low bar?"
Still can't believe there have been no acquisitions. I thought it would be a key growth strategy. It was with Dave Cote at Honeywell.
"This was from Micron's earnings report.“In China, lower consumer demand was offset by stronger data-center demand due to increased gaming, e-commerce and remote work activity,” Mehrotra said. “Looking to the third quarter, as these trends also take shape worldwide, data-center demand in all regions look strong and is leading to supply shortages.”"
Held up well on Friday. VRT starting to get some attention for its potential.
Dave Cote is not an IT guru. Honeywell could run itself

Watched the latest conference from the 26th last night. Nothing new but I gotta say I am super impressed with Gary Niederpruem Chief Strategy and Development Officer. He was so articulate and well spoken. Knew the business inside and out. Never hesitated once when answering any question.
"VRT is ready to go shopping. I would expect an acquisition sometime in the next 12 months, their borrowing terms are very favourable. Something in the 5G space would be exciting."
I'm surprised there has been no acquisitions in the last year.
"Slow and steady, I feel like there could be a pop any day with this volume"
"The new, NEW 52wk is going to start with a 5, followed by some numbers"
Slow steady move up. Hope we can break above the old high soon to really get the momentum going.
We might close that earnings gap. Got real close today.
"CEO Dave Cote did a stellar job at Honeywell and got bored after he retired from Honeywell International.The result is that he banded together with investors to address this market via Vertiv.Currently stock is trading around P/E of $26, BUT with lots of upside growth to come.This stock should continue to climb and climb steadily, based on actual performance.Keep Buying."
"Here's a note Greenwood Investors.https://www.gwinvestors.com/second-quarter-2020-letter/Vertiv, which makes cooling and power solutions for data centers, reported a 9% drop in second quarter organicrevenue. Due to both supply and customer logistical issues, the company had trouble completing customer orders,which are accelerating at a record rate with the widespread increase in data consumption around the world (endingthe second quarter with a record high backlog of $1.8 billion). Chris recently detailed Executive Chairman David Cote’sbook, Winning Now, Winning Later, in an article which you can read by clicking here. Of course it didn’t take a geniusto understand data center capacity was going to have to accelerate around the world just as Vertiv’s stock was cut inhalf earlier this year. We are excited to own Vertiv for the long-term, as Cote turns it into the Danaher of data-centers.With Cote, we are getting a seasoned manager from Honeywell, but in a much smaller company in an equally largeaddressable market. We are excited for him to exceed his Honeywell performance given a better and smallercollection of assets with stronger industry tailwinds."
have you noticed the stock market is kind of stalled in one range . I call it the Biden effect
"Operating leverage is interesting with this one. If the economy keeps heating up, they will do well. That cuts both ways of course, but still, you have to recognize the potential upside."
positive write-up in Barron's
VRT volume picking up. All time high tomorrow? Is building momentum.
"So if I'm reading this right, they're just dumping more shares, but PE is still going to have a significant chunk. It's going to be done in 4 more days. At least they're not tanking the share price by doing so. VRT is the easiest, safest money I can think of in the market today. Not the hottest, (chinese ev anyone?) but man its nice not stressing about this one."
Interesting discussion on VRT from this group posted on Twitter. Can't vouch for them but had some good things to say. VRT discussion starts at 15:20https://twitter.com/JaguarAnalytics/status/1305855400512811008
"VRT didn't discuss much about the Honeywell partnership during their conference call but Honeywell did. This is from their conference call.""We also announced a partnership with Vertiv, a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, to improve sustainability, resiliency, and operational performance for data center operations across the globe. We look forward to collaborating with Vertiv to offer integrated solutions to make it easier for data center operators to distill the mountains of data they pull from their equipment into actions that create more efficient and environmentally friendly operations."""
"VRT isn't the only company warning about margins. The market is gigantically overvalued, and expectations that profits and margins will keep improving are unrealistic at this point. A correction for the market is needed, big time. Many are predicting late fall. Eitherway, VRT is providing warning like many other companies currently are. A good healthy correction to remove the froth would be beneficial over the long run. Buy the dips."
VRT to acquire E&I Engineering group for about $2 billion. Dave Cote calls it a 1+1=3 transaction. But they also lowered 2021 guidance because of supply chain issues. They called this supply issue temporary. Stock is down 5%.

"Sleeper stock . . . If market / economy does well, so will this - of course, the reverse is also true . . . JPM thinks the market is under-appreciating the post-pandemic boom that's coming, which they say will reflect pent-up demand like in the aftermath of a natural disaster (rather than reduced demand, like in the slow-recovery aftermath of a financial crisis / deleveraging) . . . Time will tell, but if JPM is correct, then that would be good macro news for VRT and most everything else . . ."
They missed big time this quarter and guided slightly lower for 2021. Will listen to the conference call to see what they have to say.
VRT reached an all time high at 18.64
"damn, the acquisition news + the supply chain challenges literally killed all the gains from the past three months. i'm still optimistic and think they're on a good path, but i'm surprised this lead to literally dropping more than 10% in two days."
Why the big drop??
Wait 2 weeks for this to hit $15
I expected them to announce an acquisition by now. Johnson and Cote alluded to that in the December CNBC interview. Perhaps they want to hold a higher cash position because of the covid uncertainties.

"Jim Cramer had a question about VRT on his Lightning Round today. He said bank on Dave Cote. Buy, buy, buy!"

"This came out this morning. I guess I'd take $19 for now. I know nothing about Cowen and Company.Vertiv Holdings: Cowen and Company initiates with outperform, $19 price target"
"Watched a video interview a while ago with Dave Cote about Vertiv. A couple points stood out to me. First, he researched over 200 companies continually narrowing down until settling on Vertiv. Second, he was very focused on the success of this venture because he was concerned about his legacy. He didn't want failure being the last thing to remember in his career. Remember, his success at Honeywell is widely regarded as one of the greatest turnarounds success stories in business."
VRT is down 4.92% to 18.93
How long will chain of supply be affected? There is always information missing when companies comment.
Lots of selling pressure . . . Maybe someone knows something ahead of earnings?
"Niceeee we reached a new ATH, looking forward to 30s soon."
"Here's an article on VRT. I was wrong when I stated they were losing money. My apologies.https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/vertiv/going-public-vertiv-expects-pay-down-debt-eyes-acquisitions""Its 2018 revenue was about $4.3 billion, and its estimated 2020 EBITDA will be about $595 million, the company said in a statement."""
Buyers stepped in the last few minutes again. Like clockwork the last two weeks. Looks like someone is accumulating shares.
Hoping for a new all time high tomorrow.
Looking forward to the earnings report. They have a LOT to talk about. I'm most interested in the earnings effect of the Honeywell partnership.

Will happen sooner rather than later imo.https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/12/10/dave-cote-and-vertiv-ceo-rob-johnson-gs-acquisition-holdings-squawk-street.html
I expect a buyout from Honeywell but I don't think it will happen soon. Why? Because I don't think Dave Cote came out of retirement and made such an effort to identify VRT merger for his spac to do a quick hit and run. I believe they'll build the company then sell to Honeywell.Dave Cote took two years and researched hundreds of companies before settling on Vertiv.
Long term hold. Hardly pay attention to day to day price but am looking forward to the earnings call.
"Take aways from the conference call.Many questions about the change in how they report earnings. Without the changes they hit their numbers.Top priority is getting finances in order. Paying down debt, increasing margins, holding fixed cost constant.Still some drag from covid.M&A not a priority right now but if the right opportunity comes along they'll act on it."

"All time high after hours today, nothing to see here folks, move along. /s5G was an important part of AAPL's presentation today. A lot of online commentary I saw derided the fact that 5G isn't widely available yet. Basically, we've got a loooooong way to go here people. We should have an earnings release in a couple of weeks I'd expect. November 5 is my guess based off previous dates. I haven't seen any press releases announcing it."

VRT has a long term trend line that got touched yesterday and today. If you look at a weekly chart. Go back to the first week of August 2020. You can draw a perfect line across the tops of the highs to this week. I'm expecting a pullback or consolidation here.
Really nice Numbers Today!
"Due diligence suggests Veritas Pharma Inc $VRT on the CSE is the Canadian company for the joint venture. They recently held a shareholder meeting on 4/29 with details that align perfectly with the description $GPFT put out in it's PR yesterday.

Wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback to the 50 day around $20.60.
Hoping for the end of the day jump!
Saw a Vertiv banner in the background while watching CNBC today.

More institutions buying the pull back than selling. Check the Fintel website for Institutional buys and sells.
Seems like this is destined for a test of the 200 day. Selling has been non stop. I'm guessing we need to get some improvement in supply chain issues to change the trend.
so exceeded expectations? 30 this week?
Great reversal and nearly green with earnings tomorrow morning. That's a positive in my book.
Schwab has Vertiv earnings estimates at $1.02 for 2021. A pe ratio of 20 gives a price of $20.40. A ratio of 30 gives a price of $30.60. I expect some acquisition news at some point which should increase those numbers. They're also working on new products to ramp up organic sales growth. Future looks bright.

"good industry, report sounds excusey, seems they dont know how to handle growth strategy."
Mr Cote knows what he is doing when it comes to building a major company.....and he is teaching these employees as well.....longtime holder of HON and I have appreciated huge gains over the years....I dont expect VRT will be any different.
"Picking up shares, what does data have to do with the Wuhan flu?"
VRT starting to gain some traction. Up 7 out of the last 8 days. It feels like they have the financial house cleaning done and are now focused on growth. I expect good things for the rest of the year.
Any big news from the conference?
"Even with the Nasdaq down over 1.5% for 2 days VRT won’t drop, I’m actually hoping for 20$ so I can add before it takes off"
Big move today on twice average daily. Also had a 15% move in the last week or so. I don't see any news or catalyst for it.
I strongly believe the covid situation will accelerate data center innovation. Which should be good for Vertiv.
VRT is down 4.98% to 19.04
NVDA had record data center revenue. Bodes well for VRT.
Vertiv upgraded this morning probably accounted for the good day and stronger volume. * Vertiv Holdings Co : Deutsche Bank raises target price to $11 from $9 * Vertiv Holdings Co : Deutsche Bank raises to buy from hold

Looks like real good numbers.https://investors.vertiv.com/financial-news/news-details/2020/Vertiv-Delivers-Strong-Third-Quarter-Operating-Performance/default.aspx
I’ve spent way too much time doing my DD on vertiv for them to simply get bought out anytime soon.￼ but ultimately if they don’t have any plans for significant growth then I would be OK with a buyout.
I watched an interview some time again with Dave Cote. He explained it took him nearly two years and analyzed hundreds of companies until finally settling on VRT. He was also concerned about his legacy. He doesn't want everyone to give him a pass on Vertiv. He wants VRT to be another success to cement his legacy.
Would RF Industries be a potential takeover target of Vertiv?

a week ago
VRT green on a very bad day. Earnings tomorrow. Last quarter's sales growth felt like a change in character. We'll see if that trend continues. Really looking forward to this one.
VRT is going to be one of those companies like GNRC. Won't have triple digit earnings or sales growth but will show solid growth for years to come.
Solid conference call. Earnings should continue to show strong growth due to increasing margins and sales growth.
Should run like SPCE and DEAC same IPO process.
will this ever become a dividend producer ?
two days till earnings report and we seem to be going the wrong way
VRT earnings est for next year have improved to $1.20. With a PE ratio of 30 you'll get a price $36. I can live with that but honestly believe estimates will continue to improve.
Every day for the last week and a half volume has jumped in the last few minutes. Working from home and applications like zoom video conferencing will require more computing power and that means bigger and better data centers.
Dave Cote filed a Form SC13G as a 4.8% stakeholder in Vertiv. That's confidence.
this stock im holding for a long long time....min 30 by year end
"Sell off this morning(I wouldn't really call it that), is on light volume. I added some shares at $26.66. This earnings report speaks for itself."
solid ER. this is just selling the news. never sell your winners that continue to grow. long-term gains will be big here.

Anyone have a breakdown of what shape (financially) their competition is in? My brief research so far seems to indicate Vertiv has lots of debt? Is that correct?
Hoping to buy back in around $22..when do you think this stock will pop off? I’m thinking this is a hold and wait for years
VRT reached an all time high at 18.00
VRT holding the 21 day so far. Tough day but that's a key level to watch.
Cowan and company added to their position in VRT. They also own DEAC for anyone riding that boat as well.
are the hedge funds selling? 
Sorry what drove the price down today?
There is now an options chain
"Another insider, Edward Monser, bought 44,000 shares for almost half million dollars reported yesterday. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1674101.htm"
"More importantly, we got the revised forward guidance. This is going up, up, up!"
It will pop one day soon
VRT has become dead money. The one good thing is it is holding up good in a bad market!
Seems this acquisition expands VRT beyond just data center into power distribution systems for industrial and health care facilities.
What I want to hear on the earnings call.1. How does the Honeywell deal effect future earnings?2. How are they going to deal with the current order backlog?3. Why a dividend now?4. Are they looking at acquisitions?
I'll let the stock price settle for a few more days or even weeks then will consider buying a few shares on a weekly or bi weekly basis just to average in.
VRT green today. VRT makes data center equipment. MSFT announced they'll build 50-100 data centers every year for the foreseeable future. MSFT is a VRT customer.
"looks like investors are lowering the price to buy in real low before this thing takes off, imo."
That chart is a thing of beauty. Two recent touches and support at the 50 day moving average and now break out to new highs. Love it. Let's have a cigar!!
Would like to see quiet sideways movement if this market continues to sell off.
New all time highs and new all time closing high. Just keeps grinding higher. Dave Cote was known for acquisitions so I'm a little surprised we haven't seen any in almost two years.
"Brokers are all showing this as a #1, ""Strong Buy."""
VRT announced plans to redeem all public warrants. You can find the article on their website.
"I've been reading much about Data Storage Centers after one of my subscription services just recommended a Data Storage Reit. they referred to data storage as Critical Infrastructure that's needed for 5G, AI, Cloud, etc... VRT is in a very sweet spot for years to come. Long VRT!"

Anyone have an idea of what to expect from the earnings report?
Wow.. this went south real quick.3 days of huge volumes of selling.. charts damaged.
This is by far the safest and most secure growth stock I own. This thing grows like a blue chip.
Excellent opportunity.
New all time highs. Believe in Dave Cote.
smart investors buying this huge dip. wish I had some extra cash right now.
I'm wondering if management will consider a share buyback given the drop in price. There was $700 mil in cash at the last quarterly but some of that was used on the E&I acquisition.
How exactly do the warrants work. What risk is there of major dilution to the current prices due to those warrants. My robinhood doesn't support them. Kind of hard to know how low this common stack can go with such a short stock price history.

"Upgraded on 5/7 --Analyst Actions: Deutsche Bank Lifts Price Target on Vertiv Holdings to $17 From $11, Reiterates Buy Rating"
"During the December CNBC interview Dave Cote and Rob Johnson hinted at the potential of mergers and acquisitions. I'd really love to see them build the company bigger.But, with the announced partnership with Honeywell this morning I can't help but think a buy out from Honeywell is possible. I'm here for a long time unless a buy out is announced."
VRT is down 7.59% to 6.70
I'm a one year shareholder as of today. Up 78% on the total position.
"This is a confusing secondary offering. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Platinum Equity is selling 20 million of THEIR shares, will still have 95 million shares and is Vertiv's largest shareholder. Vertiv itself is not selling any shares - none of this goes to Vertiv. So this sale doesn't give Vertiv new money to buy things (cumON, Cote!) it's just their largest shareholder cashing in at a high price. So this will add to the outstanding share count (I think) with nothing to show for it for VRT shareholders. Go team."
Dave Coates and other execs are smiling and accumulating shares in droves. This is a 5 plus year hold in which you'll be greatly rewarded. Buy and forget - return later and you'll see. Warren Buffet said:. Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.

VRT is the Rodney Dangerfield of spacs. Just doesn't get any respect compared to others. Maybe that's a good thing.
Going to short VRT
VRT is down 10.09% to 19.51
any reason why volume has decreased past couple days??
Call options about to hit $30 real soon.
"""This really is a great company in a really good industry with multiple ways to continue improving the top and bottom line.""""The first quarter results sure are something to be proud of.""Dave Cote from the first quarter earnings call."
I see Q2 estimates were a little on the light side .22-.24 when analysts were expecting .27.
Two gap up days in a row feels like it may need a rest. Volume has really kicked in since the low January 8th and still don't see any catalyst. Maybe something is up. Either way I have 100% confidence in Dave Cote.
VRT green with the market deeply red shows lots of strength.

From yesterday's Reuters summary of research reports.* Vertiv Holdings Co : Melius Research starts with buy rating; price target $16
I'm wondering if it's possible that this was a sale at a predetermined price or date written into the spac agreement. I have doubts Dave Cote wanted a single shareholder holding one third of the company. It was almost exactly eight months after the merger agreement was announced.
Vertiv and Honeywell announced a partnership to work on new data center products available in 2020.Now I'm wondering about a potential buy out.
"What a boomer stock. Boring af over here. Hard to argue with it though; boring is good sometimes. Can’t wait for eps to improve, that’s what’s really going to drive sp.Institutions continue to absolutely gobble up VRT. Still long and strong."
Gawd would like to see this break $20 sometime soon. I’m falling asleep over here!￼
"Volume spikes evenly spaced about 10 minutes before the hour today. Hallmark of the institutional trader. Smallest one has been 59k. Two others were 62k and 77k. That's not your Aunt Millie. Well, it's not my Aunt Millie."
Interesting volume spikes of 100k to 150k on the one minute chart. That ain't your aunt Sue or cousin Fred.
$15 by Friday? I think so.

cornerstone stock
Vertiv management rang the opening bell on the NYSE today.
VRT has been under the radar. I believe Jim Cramer has woke it up with his buy recommendation during the Lightning Round yesterday.
record quarter. record backlog of work. msft wants to build 50-100 new centers per year. just about to turn the corner to becoming a mature company making profits. very good partnership with Honeywell and excellent Management. so much to love here.
Strong price action a week before earnings. This will be six up weeks in a row if it can hold above $21.44.
VRT is down 5.07% to 15.92
Beautiful retest of the prior high and upside reversal. I added a few shares at $20.22.
"What people don't understand is VRT is the picks and shovels of all the technology we have today. Zoom, Netflix, etc. all relies on data centers. And the covid pandemic has accelerated this trend. I'm excited about the next quarterly report."
Frustrating price action given the great earnings report but only about 6% off all time highs. My largest position and I'm sitting. I believe in Dave Cote. His track record speaks for itself.
A whole bunch of institutions bought shares on Thursday and Friday.https://fintel.io/sob/us/vrt
VRT is up 4.91% to 18.16
Dividend this quarter?
this just does not want to go past $28.
"when is earnings? since the share price seems stuck in the $18 range, I'm trying to figure any catalysts for it going higher.. any guesses?"
sellers will regret
Climbing!!
Couple of upgrades this morning. This is from a Schwab summary released every morning. : Cowen and Company raises target price to $20 from $18 : Deutsche Bank raises target price to $20 from $18
Looks like the third largest volume day since the merger was announced.
In the fourth week of a consolidation with only an 8% pull back so far. That's solid price action.
This chart has the look of a chart that wants to blow up. How about some merger/acquisition news.
looking for reentry below $20
"This is the type of company/stock you want to own. Essential to the future of AI, 5+G, and whatever technology is rolled out. Critical Infrastructure. And regardless of what's going on in the world, it will be needed. Enjoy the ride."
Last earnings report was a major change in my opinion. The estimates for the Wednesday report are for flat eps vs last year and 1.2 vs 1.0 in revenue. This has the potential to be a blow out.
"technical wise, whats the support line?"
Vertiv has changed the way the are stating EPS which is causing some confusion. They are going over the changes in the conference call.
"a dividend? really? ummm... okay, thanks! Please buy companies and make the share price go up!"

How much of VRT business is 5G related?
Cramer finally mentioned VRT last night in the Lightening Round. Of course Cramer and Cote are friends. Cote was on a the show two months ago and all they talked about was Cote's new book. I figured that Cramer would not mention VRT because it was too small. But now that people are calling in asking about it and as it grows Cramer will probably start pushing it more and more. It is not the next Amazon but it looks like it could be a double over the next 2 years. Any thoughts?
slow and steady wins the race
The one key for me is the strategy of acquisition has not started yet. That will be a key growth strategy imo.
VRT is down 5.20% to 20.22
VRT is up 4.93% to 20.99
