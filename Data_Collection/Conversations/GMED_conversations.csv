Bank of America downgrades Globus to underperform. I guess that 3000 screws implanted milestone wasn't very impressive
"The Key here is The growth in MJ sales! 116% y o y, this is high margin business. Near 49% gross margin. The distribution business cc pharma had a drop albeit 4.5% q over q as this is a low margin business. I would think institutional investors would like the growth number in the high margin business. Overall report seems decent to good. Stock price may bounce but overall this was good. Remember the reason share price of APHA never went higher was the complaint that most of the money came from distribution business and now it’s actually MJ business. Wait for conference call, if MJ sales surpass distribution sales in couple quarters or 3 q’s, we have a double digit stock!"
why is this up so sharply?
Why are revenues flat? Has this company already reached the TAM??
"Volumn way up today, 200K by 11:00. Price did not budge. Odd."
Who else found about this stock and came to this board after seeing the Reddit post? 
Good to see this stock gaining momentum again.
Every little bump gets dumped huge and re-shorted. Very entertaining to watch. The street knows what is coming and it is not good. MZOR about to destroy this foreign one trick pony. See you at $35.

Another rock solid earnings report today. I certainly don't regret that I invested in this company. Will keep my stocks for years. Very large potential.
ah when did gamestop start selling medical devices?
might be the 2020 guidance but this is a competitive space with Stryker and others-I think gmed is over sold all-over reaction to announcement-given time it willbe a winner

David Gardner has never steered me wrong. Looking forward to next earnings!!!
"I believe stock sold off after last earnings, but quickly bounced back. Hopefully will see same this time."
"This dumpster fire goes down every day, no matter what the market does. There's never any news either. The management team should at least put out some positive PR every once in a while to stop the bleeding."
Creeping upward towards earnings. Encouraging for the longs.
n16m15 must be out shopping for Vaseline now! Best to all MZOR longs.

Running out of gas here?
"What was so negative today, 1/9/20. Preliminary earnings numbers and 2020 seem good. Was the market looking for stellar instead of very good? More companies should underpromise/over deliver so these expectation games are kept in check."
GMED GMED GMED!? what is the news?

This has not been at all time highs for a while. Its a welcome development
