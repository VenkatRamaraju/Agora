"Dentist’s office closed - no sales , shares tankBut great long term buy !"
Envista had shutdown for 6 weeks and continued reduce and furlough employees. The 2nd quarter gonna get huge loss also in the 3rd quarter. It should start recover at the end of the year or next year.
NVST will rise after earning out tomorrow morning. Buying it by today is the last chances.

Why would anyone tender their DHR shares for NVST???? Even at a 7% discount it doesnt make sense. Look at the NVST P&L and guidance from the last earnings call. I see why they were spun off. They were a financial detractor to DHR .
Envista has strong fundamentals and excellent management teams. Ormco is a part of Envista moved to new building and very busy. SP will double in next year like Danaher. (Envista was spin off from Danaher for expand bussiness)
"This won’t end well, lots of competition already"
Still happy you exchanged your DHR for ENV?????
Nice going
