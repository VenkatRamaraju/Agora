i see this dropping back down to under 80s. Ran up to fast and now overpriced. company still doesn't make a profit and are spending on expansion which till 2025 probably won't see a profit and already hinted at capital raise.
"Had a huge run up and is now trading sideways, im wondering if tmrw will bring a huge sell off or more support. Thoughts?"
Wolfspeed is up 19.95% to 109.00
bought at $80sold $122
"I don't have any position in this stock, but I don't see anything special about it. Is it only up because of a short squeeze? It's been around since 1987, but won't even be profitable for another three years?"
"I don't follow this stock closely. Why did it change it's name to Wolfspeed? I've owned CREE for about 10 years. It's a long-term holding for me, but I don't religiously check the news about it."
Seems it’s finally starting to run
"Many years ago I used to attend the shareholder meetings. Each year we got the song and dance about something just over the horizon .. LED backlighting… LED channel lighting, the blue laser, incandescent lighting replacement… In the discussions among shareholders after the presentation I remember a shareholder saying that he thought eventually power chips would become the company business and the commodity LED business would probably be sold off. At the time such a prediction was considered NUTS.. and here we are. A common shareholder had the vision that the CEO did not. At that time CREE was a much smaller company. Over time the marketcap has grown a lot. Many shares have been birthed into existence for executive compensation, to buy Neil’s fixture business and a lot of other dead ends.. while all along it was the power chip that was the future of CREE. I still expect this to be a good investment from this point forward but it’s not going to be the life changer it could have been. Former CEO’s have been too interested in creating more shares and not shareholder value. I watched the share price stagnate for a long time as the marketcap continued to grow. At one shareholder meeting I personally asked Chuck how I, a common shareholder of modest means could own more shares than he did as CEO? His response was “how man options do you have?”. I’d love to know if Chuck owns any shares of WOLF? I kinda doubt it."
12 million short shares have to be covered. Go WOLF!
"This company is ideally positioned to benefit both from a tech strategic geo-political environment, and the actual industry they in. Long long-dated calls"
"WOLF will be easily double , triple soon if you believe in EV evolution and TSLA."
"Cash from ops was negative even excluding R&D costs. Watch for an upcoming equity raise. Same sheep now in wolf clothing.@@@Cash generated from operations was negative 63 million and capital expenditures for 200. 9 million resulting in negative free cash flow of 272 million. We believe we are in solid position with approximately 850 million of cash and liquidity on hand to support our growth. However, we will be opportunistic from a capital market standpoint to ensure we can have the flexibility to invest as we see fit, to continue to underpin our position in the market and fuel future growth"

"WOLF inks a new agreement with GM to supply SiC devices for their EVs. Its appears everyone wants to to use WOLF's SiC. Of course EV manufacturers don't have many choices for their SiC needs. In the meantime Institutions continue to accumulate WOLF shares. A few months ago institutions owned 108% of the outstanding shares. Last month this increased to 110%, and now it is up to 111.2 %. It appears the shorts continue to create more shares with their shorting in their presumed effort to control the pricehttps://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/news/article?c_name=invest_VENDOR&docKey=1952-3e324cca77c550b852a2ac79283c08ae-04%20Oct%202021"
How come no mention of Wolf on CNBC? Why does this not cross the CNBC ticker tape?
Top stock gainer excluding microcap today. Ooh LA LA
"If you believe in TSLA, it is time to long WOLF. There are many short shares. A short squeeze will happen. Be patient!"
"we already have a signs of a slow down with AAPL and AMZN earnings reports today. too little too late for this company, probably have companies stocking up cause they were caught short with the shortage which will eat in to WOLF future sales"
100 options are picking up
Love days like these. Absolute disaster for the 12% shorting it
