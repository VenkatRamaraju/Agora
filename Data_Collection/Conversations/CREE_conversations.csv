"Gonna Sell Short a lot of shares of CREE in just a few minutes, as a Pure Earnings play. I expect yet another losing quarter from CREE, and the stock is still significantly over-valued. CREE should sink down in direct response to her earnings release. I think there is a very good chance of a 5-12% decline in stock price tomorrow for CREE."
"Ramaz welcome to the board. All opinions are appreciated. seeing as Wolspeed and other SiC manufacturers are sold out for at least the next five years. In addition Cree has announced plans to quadruple manufacture of SiC and devices, why in the world would you forecast a drastic decline in the stock price"
Can Cree make enough chips to meet VW demand?
"Cree: Don't PanicJun. 26, 2019 9:00 AM ET|2 comments | About: Cree, Inc. (CREE)Business Quant Business QuantLong/short equity, event-driven, research analyst, techBusiness Quant(7,128 followers)SummaryCree's management lowered their Q4 revenue guidance earlier this month to factor in the impact of Huawei's blacklisting by US regulators.The development may temporarily hold back Cree's revenues for a quarter or two but the company is making all the right moves to resume its growth momentum.This is a good time to be bullish on Cree.Shares of Cree (CREE) have remained distressed ever since US regulators blacklisted one of its customers, Huawei, back in May. Granted that some of Cree’s revenues would dry up following this notification, I don’t think that there’s any reason for investors to start panicking and exiting their positions as of yet. In fact, there’s reason to believe that Cree can make up for the lost revenue stream and the company as a whole might as well continue on with its growth trajectory in the coming months. Let’s take a closer look at it all.(Source: Bigstockphoto, Image license purchased by author)Evaluating the ImpactThe escalating trade-related tensions between the US and China calls for a re-evaluation of impacted firms but it doesn’t always call for exiting long positions in exposed companies. I believe that’s the case with Cree. Huawei may be one of its customers but it wasn’t a major revenue driver for the company as a whole.In fact, Cree disclosed in a press release earlier this month that its revenues from Huawei’s wireless infrastructure buildouts were estimated to be $15 million in Q4 FY19. It also noted that it “does not expect to ship any additional products in the fourth quarter for the Huawei build-out and cannot predict when it will be able to resume such shipments”.Prior to this blacklisting, Cree was expecting its Q4 revenues to come in between $263 million and $271 million, equating to a mid-point revenue forecast of $267 million. This essentially meant that its sales to Huawei would have amounted to about 5.6% of its overall revenue. Granted the percentage figure isn’t exactly small, but it’s not big enough to cripple the materials manufacturer either.Cree’s management lowered their guidance post-Huawei’s blacklisting. They now expect Q4 revenues to be between $245 million and $252 million, implying a mid-point guidance of $248.5 million. This is about a 6% revenue decline on a year on year basis – after excluding the revenue contribution of its lighting division in Q4 FY18 since it was sold earlier this year – so it’s not exactly terrible guidance and it shouldn’t induce panic among investors.(Revenue By Segment, Source: BusinessQuant.com)But apart from a temporary loss of 5-6% of its revenues, Cree doesn’t face any long-lasting financial or operational headwinds as a result of this blacklisting. I say this because some other affected companies:Have lost more than half of their revenues, and/or;Their global supply chains need a shakeup to remain operationally viable, and/or;They’ve permanently lost market share.Fortunately, for long-side investors at least, Cree doesn’t seem to be materially affected in any of the above ways.The Bigger PictureNote that Huawei isn’t the only networking company out there that’s providing hardware for 5G wireless deployments. Nokia and Ericsson were the second and third largest wireless equipment providers last year respectively, and they’ve gained sales momentum at Huawei’s expense since the latter got blacklisted.(Wireless Equipment Market Share, Source)So, how does this concern Cree?Well, the company has two reporting segments, LED Products and Wolfspeed. The former is irrelevant to this discussion as it doesn’t involve networking applications and rather finds its way into video screens, automotive lighting and specialty lighting. On the other hand, its Wolfspeed division is very relevant to this discussion as it includes the sale of Silicon Carbide and Gallium Nitride materials, RF devices and power devices, and has applications in military communications, satellite, telecommunications equipment etc.(Gross Profit by Segment, Source: BusinessQuant.com)So, needless to say, its rapidly growing Wolfspeed segment would take a sales hit in the coming few quarters due to Huawei’s blacklisting. But I suspect it’ll be a temporary dip for Cree over the longer run. Note that Cree is the leading manufacturer of Silicon Carbide and Gallium Nitride materials. Networking equipment manufacturers are starting to use these materials in their new gear as these materials offer lower operational costs and improve efficiency over conventional silicon nodes. It was discussed during the company’s Q2 FY19 earnings call that Cree had about 50% share of this market.(Source: Cree's Investor Presentation)This means that if Nokia and Ericsson are gaining market share at Huawei’s expense, then the industry-wi"
"So I've been long on this since October 17th (looks like the day after that volume spike that probably caught my screener. I don't know much about the company at all beyond consumer lighting, flashlights, and industrial stuff for places like the YMCA with high ceilings and big electricity bills. I can't find much news beyond what is in the feed here. When I spent like 3 hours looking into Wolfspeed the other day, I literally can't even understand what they actually do. Somewhere Wolfspeed's product (magic box that makes electricity or power more efficient?) is just a new thing. It is its own market and that there were only 2 players for a LONG time until 2 more came on a few years ago. So I don't even understand the market. Will they be in all 5G towers and electric cars? Is it just the same thing as is being used already but instead of using silicon it is using silicon carbide? If that is the case, how can other companies be in the market if they have a patent on the process? Do they license and, therefore, control their competitors? Does anyone know when I can learn more about this company beyond this newsfeed and filings? I don't think I've ever been in a company with so little written about it. If it's goign to be in all 5G towers and electric cars, why isn't the CEO acting like Elon Musk would? That news would send this equity through the roof. I'm just looking for information and conversation. People in real life don't know anything about stocks let alone this one. Although, I'm an environmental consultant, they are actually known by my friends for their flashlights and those bars the 'manly' men colleagues have on their trucks. That would be it though. Please use this message board, guys."

"The following is the summary from a Seeking Alpha article. More fuel for the fire.SummaryCree will be biggest benefactor of the EV/5G trends.But steep valuation and perfect execution necessary for long-term investors to profit.Too many uncertainties regarding capacity expansion and adoption of EVs and 5G.Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) is a company riding two huge trends, the adaptation of electrical vehicles (EVs) and 5G. This can be seen in the revenue multiple expansion from 5x to 10x over the last 52 weeks. We view Cree as the biggest benefactor of the industry trends, but there are too many uncertainties surrounding capacity expansion at the current valuation."

"Yesterday there was 1.5 million shares sold short. This followed a day of 354,301 short sales. in addition there has been an extraordinary large number of short sales for the last two weeks. Very likely these short sales were probably covered when a number of stop loss orders were taken out yesterday. We live in interesting times"
I wouldn't be surprised to briefly see $ 60 after earning.
Maybe the name will be changed to Wolfspeed. Wolfspeed provides decades of growth. Probably big growth in Rf in 2019 and 2020 s 5g is put in place by telecom. Company forecasts 30% of cars will be electric in 14 years. Not good for oil investments??
"Yes SiC has a great future but CREE is facing at least a dozen companies many larger in SiC and many are larger companies with connection to the auto industry with great resources. For example Tesla buys their SiC devices from STM not CREE.CREE record is abysmal, they were one of the first with LEDs and after about 25 year they sell it for a lousy $300 million. CREE's record of promises and delivery does not give one much confidence in their ability to make money."
A hidden gem...This will make a lot of people really rich. Planning on moving 40% of my portfolio here.
"The recent downward movement for Cree may be due to lowering of incentives for electric vehicles (EV) in China. Due to the lower incentives, the expectation is for EV market to slow slightly in China. However, the uptake of SiC-based inverters (see Delphi-Cree announcement) will more than compensate for the slightly (temporary) softness in the EV market in China. EV growth will be lead by EU, so I see Cree being very busy for the next several years. Buy, buy, buy!!"

Good article on why Cree sold the lighting divisionhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/0d0026f4-bb1c-3a26-8c3e-3695537aab45/cree-ceo%3A-why-divesting.html
"Nope, I was right! New LOD right here...."
CREE reached a new 52 Week High at 48.81
Wake up all you CREE investors and followers- what is going on here? 12.75% share price jump today (May 18) and no comments? can anyone tell us what is going on there?
"Still Short all my shares of CREE. Could we get another sell-off to the $75 level?? Of course. Will we?? I dunno. :-) Anyone who says they can find the bottom on any trade is a liar. If they do find the bottom it is just a lucky guess. Watching L2 helps a seasoned trader to gauge how things LOOK like they MIGHT play out over the next few minutes in real-time. That's about it. So...we do the best we can to make educated, well-researched, and reasonable guesses on when it is best to Cover a Short, or to Sell a Long play. The LOD here is just over $75, and in hindsight a very good Cover would have been around $76 as she was climbing up from her LOD. But that is hindsight, useless in any real-time moment of Now. :-) Still have great paper profit on this play, and still staying Short because I think odds favor a downside move over an upside move."
"Seeing a quick higher-volume runup on no news anda single analyst upgrade is curious. Is there chatterof a takeover, say from the likes of a Texas Instruments,since foreign corporations are shut out here?With recent events like Nvidia/ARM and AMD/Xilinx,perhaps that is the driver."
Is CREE's stock held up by short squeeze(s)?
You know why Cree is not affected by the silicon shortage.. They produce their own SiC. Keep watching as their stock just keeps going higher. I'm all in.

"$3-buck Chuck Tried to sell Wolf Speed and never gave a damn about shareholders. His ridiculous options compensation package insured he did well while the rest of held the bag. His left leaning political views were more than obvious to anyone who attended shareholder meetings. He was on a mission to save the world with sold state lighting and maybe the rest of us would get to go along for the ride. Its interesting that this CEO is taking the exact opposite approaching dumping the low margin LED business to leverage CREE's advantages in RF and Power. Thinking back 15 years or more I wonder how much more successful this company could have been with good management and without all the family drama and personal #$%$ A fellow shareholder said many years ago at one of the annual meetings that eventually power chips would be the company and LEDs would probably be sold off.... then the meeting started Chuck went on one of his annual rants about the blue laser, LED backlighting, or some other dead end business where the competition might not have been as bright but, but bright enough and profitable below CREE's cost of production. Its amazing the some lowly shareholders had more vision than the overpaid CEO.What trinket will shareholders get at meetings now though ?"
"Gonna ride CREE for at least one more hour. Looks like a huge trading win is pretty much ensured. Whether I cover at $80 or at $75, the profit is huge, by my standards, considering the number of shares I hold and my entry price of $86.17. You have to try to ride your winners, maximize profits, in order to succeed as a Pure Earnings Short Seller. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. But pulling the trigger too fast will end up, in the long run, costing you more money than pulling the trigger too slowly..."
"Some interesting facts about CREE stock ownership. In the last 6 months the stock short position has increased from 6.9 million shares to 13.3 million shares on`10/15/20. At the same time the institutional ownership of the float has increased from 98% to a little over 111%. This possibly suggests that some entity, probably a hedge fund, may be in a pile of hurt, in the future. Of course one could also be accumulating and shorting at the same time. In any case it looks to me like someone may be in a very risky position."
"Remember when the analysts downgraded the stock, It is the time to buy. There is a lot of potential for CREE. It is also a take over target."

Here comes the lunch time lows
"Sold at $74.50, but I am looking to get back in if stock goes down to low 60s. I think Cree is a long term buy, but short term electric cars and China 5G are headwinds."
I think the drop is a reaction to the news that Cree will invest $1B in 200 mm(8 inch) wafer fabrication and in larger SiC production capacity. It certainly seems reasonable and logical after the last conference call discussed capacity limitations. Moving to 200 mm wafers will result in more efficient use of the wafer geometry and should reduce cost. Cost reduction to become more competitive with Si semiconductors was stated as an important way of gaining market share.
what is the target for this week ? any ideas ?
Looks like the market is ignoring the law suit. Maybe this suggests that the suit is trivial
It will never cease to amaze me how hedge funds will keep pumping money into companies that keep losing money quarter after quarter after quarter
"On call, ramp in 2024 even faster. Mohawk plant will have much higher margins. Costs 50% lower in Mohawk Valley. Yields will be higher. Pilot line supports these claims."
"Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer raised the firm's price target on Cree to $132 from $126 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after his recent visit to the company's 200mm facility in Mohawk Valley, New York left him ""convinced that Cree represents the potential to transform the electrification trend much like what Intel did to digitization in the 1980/90s."" He compares the way that wide band gap semis ""fundamentally change"" the design landscape for electrifying multiple markets to the way ""steel was to concrete,"" Dorsheimer added in his note published earlier."

"I'm out. Had to take my profits on this one. Up 50%. I couldn't take a chance on May 1st. They probably will go to 100, but I just had to take the money and run. GE has vicious lawyers and trying to sell the lighting division weighed on my decision. Good luck to those that hold."
"Reaction today is in sympathy with drop in INTC . I like to compare with XLNX (tanked yesterday on ER) and KEYS. Both are 5G stocks.Also, CREE has been on a RIP up 35% over last 3 months, so was due for a pullback."
Short squeeze? Shorts worried about Monday?
My take is that Cree is in talks to sell their Lighting biz to AYI which is falling. This makes sense with Gregg Lowe in charge and indicated by the last cc when he said they were increasing their investment in Wolfspeed. That division has twice the margins of their LED chip and lighting biz and addresses power/electric vehicles a rapidly growing and expanding market.
9-11. Any detail on today's UPGRADE by Roth Capital?
WOW! Great move by Lowe that is getting rid of the lighting div. I have to admit that I was disappointing when they bought into the lighting market several years ago. Now that they are out they can focus on their on their real expertise that is semiconductors and semiconductor materials. Lowe has been a real god send as CEO.
"Earnings are already priced in to perfection and still with a projected $1.27 it puts them at a PE of 38. This doesn't exactly scream value and on top of that I think everyone knows this year for the markets could get a little rocky. Imho, we haven't see the bottom yet. I'm looking at somewhere around 18,000-18,500 on the dow."
"Bubble is about to pop. It looks like no meaningful earnings for the next 2 to 4 years. Co acknowledge the new plant is a year away and will take another year or two to break in and bring cost down, also the possible orders are up to 4 years away as it can take that long for design in to translate into production run.It hard to justify this price so many many years away from maybe making money."
good to see cree beef up SiC
"Sinbadger- This is very bad news for CREE. STM has given CREE their biggest orders for SiC wafers("" long-term silicon carbide wafer supply agreement to more than $500 million"") and now that they can make their own, I doubt CREE will see any repeat orders. Also STM is way ahead of CREE in application, they are already supplying Tesla and other EV companies and that is were the big money will be made."

"Sorry folks but I think CREE has had it's run for a while. It jumped too far, too fast and now it's leveled off with low volume. To me that indicates a topping and probably a slow descent back to where it belongs.....around $38. Long term this will be a winner, but even the analysts are saying wait for a drop to get in. I've been in since around $24 and took my profits the past week, now waiting for a good re-entry point. If it takes off, I did fine. GLTA."

Covering my short in the mid thirties tomorrow like I said I would last year.
"Cree CEO Greg Lowe did a presentation this morning. Points I found interesting:-on GaN, several quarters of ""fast swimming"" trying to catch up with demand-VW FAST program-- Cree is one of 67 VW suppliers in FAST program (out of 50,000 VW suppliers)-one-half of SiC people in world work for Cree-two sales models for SiC (1) for sales one to two quarters out, no price negotiations; (2) for long term supply agreements, around five years, customer gets guaranteed access to some capacity and gets access to cost reductions going forward. Apparently cost reductions over upcoming years are pre-determined (set now), rather than being most favored customer type price commitments. High 40's to low 50's margin for Cree; take or pay commitments, with some variability. Up-fron capacity reservation deposits.-Cap Ex-- less than 200 this FY; over 200 next two FY; then tailing off. 150 mm for now; new 200 mm initial production run FY 2022. New giant ""mega-factory"" for materials; second new factory two miles away in different power grid. No new brok and mortar'""really good line of sight"" on further mfging cost reductions"

There are many companies much larger and successful than CREE that are involved in SiC developments.

"The selloff was probably due to two factors, a weak market yesterday and the President's action of putting Huawei on a trade blacklist. Obviously Huawei needs SiC for their 5G products. This morning The President provided relief for Huawei suppliers. When one is in a sold out position, such as Cree is in at the moment, with plans to quadruple production, it's hard to imagine that a single customer will have much impact on Cree future sales. My guess is that the sp will drift in the range of $60 to $65 for the quarter until the next quarterly results and then continue to climb. Sofya I think you missed a digit in your price forecast. In 2020, I suspect the price will escalate to the range of $135 to $140."

Might we enjoy the pleasure of watching CREE open the trading session at -$80.00?? I think we just might!
At this rate of appreciation we may be back to triple digits in a few weeks. The Canaccord target may be achieved by early next year. That is assuming devices for EV and 5G begin to escalate in early 2022

Anyone have any thoughts on this that is not someone shorting the stock or a troll?

This equity bothers me with the lack of news and it's impossible to try to get some insight into what is going on at the company."
Some interesting numbers. In the month of June the shares short increased from 12.05 M shares to 12.85 M shares. In the meantime the institutional ownership increased from 108.5 % to to 112.53 %.

CREE is where I am putting my money right now. I have a close family member who works at the Durham facility and he is currently involved in purchasing and setting up new fab equipment for silicon carbide wafer processing.

I think we will see this run again today.
IIVI will not have significant manufacturing for 200mm SIC wafers until 2014 at the earliest. They are only spending $1 billion over 10 years currently. They see SiC in a super cycle.

This stock will continue to rise. The direction that has been taken by the new Management is the right path and it will pay off soon.
"Good luck with your short trades, but I suspect you are just blowing smoke. The last 20 after hour trades amounted to a total of 77 shares and 15 of those trades were single share trades. It appears that someone was using the lack of late volume to keep the price down, with single share trades. I suspect we will see a real pop by tomorrow afternoon because it was a pretty strong quarterly report"

I had a Buy Cover order in at $79.00 around 3:40 ET, but I could see she was trending down so I lowered it to $78.90, then $78.80, then $78.70, then $78.60, before finally allowing the Cover to hit at $78.50. Every penny counts, folks! I'm outta here, it's been a pleasure doing business with you. Maybe I see you again in three months time, if this Bloated Baby gets even more bloated...Good Luck! :-)"
Electric car is a reality. Key to Cree stock is electric car goes beyond 5% market share. New cars will be much safer. Less costs over the life of the vehicle.
Peter you forgot to mention one important fact. STM hopes to build a new SiC plant which they hope to bring onstream in 2024. It will only supply 40% of their Sic needs. They will be buying from CREE for a long time
Not long ago this stock was left for dead.. So many people confidently shorting.. Now it hits new highs...
CREE keeps dropping. Is this because of trade tensions with China?
Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer maintains Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) with a Buy and raises the price target from $126 to $132.
"Why isn't this board active? I would think day traders and momentum people would be in here like crazy. I don't want to jinx anything with my analysis, but... It's just weird to me that it's tumbleweeds in here at the moment."
"Without being explicit, CREE has essentially signaled that they do not expect to be profitable until 2024. 2024! It is 2021 now. 3 years is a LIFETIME in terms of the technology sector. Everything could and most likely WILL change before 2024. For anyone to even consider paying even $80/share today, for a company that has not been profitable since the middle of 2019 and essentially admits it won't be profitable until 2024, is absurd and proves the market bubble of Irrational Exuberance that we are currently in. So happy to be Short on this one and looking for a much bigger drop of 10-15% from yesterday's close, during the regular session. I see a 50/50 chance CREE goes as low as $75 at some point today."

"CREE is collapsing fast here in the pre-market. Looks like a Perfect Storm of the market waking up and realizing it is CRAZY to even THINK of paying more than $65-$70 for a company with such weak financials and uncertain future, as CREE has. Well, I am NOT covering this one anytime soon! Looking for a 15-20% downside collapse now..."
"Here in the early pre-market, CREE is trading at $80.71! Pre-market does NOT accurately predict how a stock will open or trade during the regular session, but the simple fact is that CREE delivered a very weak earnings release with absolutely no visible path to profitability. It sold off immediately upon earnings release and has remained down 3-6% from yesterday's close, throughout the AH and now the PM session. There is no reason to think CREE can generate any sustained upside rally at any point today. I expect CREE to lose $80 at some point during the regular session. It could easily open below $80, and then I expect the stock to spend much of the day around the $80 level, likely selling off even more as the day goes on. So happy to be Short a lot of shares, and have no plans to try to Cover this Short Sell before 2 PM ET at the earliest, unless this collapses all the way into the lower $70's, first. For my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, I am looking at: BJ, EL, BBWI, and KEYS. Right now I am favoring BJ as my next play. BJ is over-valued and it should sell off upon earnings release, I'm thinking at lest 4-8%, even if there is a modest beat of EPS and Revenue consensus estimates."
"Gonna lose $75 here, still no buyers!"
"here's what Real Money had to say in their recent article about Cree""s future""Bottom line strategy: Traders and investors could go long CREE at current levels and add to longs above $74. Risk a close below $65 for now. $97-$100 is our first upside price target with the $225 area longer-term"""
THE worst is behind for CREE. The trend is up. Hold for next 3-5 years and you will be rewarded beautifully.
I think we should wait a few days to see how the market is really going to react. The Wolfspeed sales increase is profound. I expect that the share price increase will continue once we get past this momentary gyration.
"Well, would you look at that! CREE is already collapsing here in the pre-market. All the way down to $79! Last chance to get out of this sinking boat...."
what i think we saw today was an effort to take out all of the stop loss order. When it's over we will gravitate back to the mid $50 by week end. I took the opportunity to buy a few more shares cheap
"This stock is so overpriced it’s crazy. $103 and some change. Not sure what is going on, but anyone jumping in long at this price point is crazy."
P. S. The growth rate cited will quadruple the business in five years.
Just got back into cree on this recent drop. Will add if it continues to fall into the $30s. Wolfspeed is going to rock.
"Okay, a few bargain hunters finally showed up. Not Covering here, let them push it up a little, I think she will still drop down more over the next few hours."
"Institution must be dumping,must feel ea. are to far off to be invested now and so bad things may happen before this co has earnings. They could not make money in LEDs by even being first to market and now many others are ahead of CREE in EV, ie.Tesla uses STM SiC devices. Cree will have to show they can make meaningful money before they invest in Cree-tmo"
"Couldn't hold $79 here in the pre-market. This does not look good for the regular session at all. Could bargain-hunters come in and pick this back up a bit?? Sure, as long as Irrational Exuberance rules the markets. But who in their right mind wants to hold this until 2024 with the ""promise"" of profitability. Is Rip Van Winkle in the house??"
CREE is up 6.11% to 37.16
What share price would it take to buy CREE out? Realistically what could we expect?
New statistics show that institutional ownership has increased from 108% to a little over 112%. In addition a recent article states that hedge fund ownership has increased from 25 to 30. I guess the smart money knows where to invest
"Cree price target raised to $132 from $126 at Canaccord CREE Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer raised the firm's price target on Cree to $132 from $126 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after his recent visit to the company's 200mm facility in Mohawk Valley, New York left him ""convinced that Cree represents the potential to transform the electrification trend much like what Intel did to digitization in the 1980/90s.""

Going UP! Biz is increasing at Wolfspeed and the company is being transformed. There's a reason the US Government wouldn't allow the sale of Wolfspeed to Germany's Infineon. The future is bright for innovative CREE.
I used to attend all the annual meetings. Used to talk to other investors and came across a few that thought CREE’s future was not in lighting but in power chips. At the time it seemed far fetched. “3 buck Chuck’s” focus was on lighting ...and filling his own pockets with cheap options while shareholders held the bag. CREE was once by far my largest holding and I made money on it. It’s still probably 3rd with IIVI being #1. But with Chuck’s direction I couldn’t afford to take the risk. He tried to sell the future of the company and luckily the government stepped in and stopped the sale. How can stockholders have a more clear vision of where this company needs to focus than its former CEO? I think Chucks liberal politics and green agenda played a large part too. Finally we have a CEO who is running the company for shareholders.

"Not bad rally at Cree recently. Probably and arguably Wolfspeed is what really adds value to Cree. Chips prices per car will be much higher the higher their electrification level, based on some studies originating from Chip makers like Infineon. Seeing a small portion of it as wide band gap (WBG) material is the real potential and chance for Cree/Wolfspeed. At least power switches have in many applications many benefits when they are from WBG materials, like SiC, especially in higher Voltage ranges, in which device type can be FET instead of IGBT for faster switching. Only real issue that prevents me from investing now is the fact that with current numbers Cree is overvalued imo. And it will take some years until we see how SiC sales will affect their growth. I understand that they still have potential with GaN and 5G market, but being supplier for some Chinese companies is a risk currently."
