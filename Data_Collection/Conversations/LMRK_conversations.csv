"""Dear Members of the Board of Directors: Verde Investments, Inc.

We write to inform you of our proposal to acquire, through one or a series of all-cash transactions, substantially all of the assets of the Company. If our proposal is consummated, holders of Landmark’s common units not already owned by Verde and its affiliates would receive $13.50 per common unit in cash. In light of our substantial equity stake in Landmark, we are required to make the existence and contents of this letter public.""""Although our proposed per common unit consideration already represents a meaningful premium to the Colony Proposal, we expect we could make our price even higher depending on the findings of our confirmatory due diligence. Though we have not yet had occasion to examine Landmark’s non-public information, we have reviewed extensive publicly available information regarding the Company and are encouraged by what we have learned to date. As a result of the fact that we have already undertaken this “outside-in” due diligence investigation, we anticipate that we will be able to swiftly conduct our confirmatory due diligence in support of the transaction we propose. We have also analyzed the relevant regulatory approval considerations in connection with our proposal and are confident that all necessary approvals can be obtained in a timely fashion."" https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1615346/000119312521217419/d139956dex991.htm"

When there have been multiple competing bids from multiple bidders and then a press release states that LMRK will be sold to the GP of LMRK and NO THIRD PARTY BIDS WILL BE CONSIDERED you have a CLEAR Breach of Fiduciary Duty liability.Melody recently bid $16.25 and the GP of LMRK ups their bid to just .25 cents higher at $16.50 and LMRK states that no third party bids will be considered?The Breach of Fiduciary Duty class action lawsuits are going to fly.Open up the bidding to all interested parties and be fair and transparent with all bidders and bidding and obtain the highest price for OUR LMRK assets.

"Grande Verde; Receives Topping Offer of $13.50 per Share in CashFriday afternoon, it was disclosed in an SEC filing (linked HERE) that Landmark InfrastructurePartners (LMRK) had received an offer of $13.50 per common unit in cash for substantially all theassets of the company from Verde Investments (an ~8.2% owner of LMRK common units). Thistops the initial offer of $13.00 per share that DigitalBridge proposed on May 17 and made officialon June 2. In addition, Verde (Ernest C. Garcia II President) submitted a Letter to the LandmarkBoard of Directors requesting the Conflicts Committee and/or Board immediately enter intodiscussions with Verde, as Verde is willing to engage with the company, its investors, its advisors,and/or any other relevant parties. Verde made its offer based on an “outside-in” due diligence,and expects it could offer an even higher price depending on the findings of confirmatory duediligence.But LMRK’s relationship status is complicated, since on June 2 DigitalBridge (formerly knownas Digital Colony) closed on the acquisition of Landmark Dividend (LD) that owns, among otheritems, 100% of the General Partner (GP) interests in Landmark Infrastructure Partners (LMRK) aswell as ~13.2% of the Limited Partner (LP) common units. See our note HERE. In conjunction withthe acquisition of LD, DigitalBridge made the $13/share offer for LMRK, a 9% premium to the preannouncement closing price of $11.97. So, with a topping offer on the table, we will maintain aclose watch and continue to provide updates on any new developmentRaym9nd James TP $16"
LMRK is undervalued. $17 is in sight.
The market is sniffing out that the $16.50 cozy buyout offer will not go through. LMRK unit price now above that $16.50 offer price.
...in bad faith has been in this LMRK situation. There WILL be a class action lawsuit over this if the LMRK board goes forward in accepting a lowball $16.50 bid for LMRK.

"Curious if anyone has any direct experience with any of the four law firms who have so far announced investigations and possible actions against LMRK and its board. Unitholders clearly getting the short end of the stick with how this has been handled. This is a small position for me, but just on principle this deal stinks - I'm on a couple of private company boards and would absolutely expect to get sued if we sold to a related party without a full auction process for price discovery."
Why did Yahoo destroy their own website? Where are all of the prior posts?If they want us to use other websites then that is easy enough.
Landmark Dividend LLC only own 13.2% of the units of LMRK so far greater than 50% is in the hands of unitholders who can vote this lousy $13.00 offer price down. Watch your mail/email for your proxy voting material and Vote NO!

Not a single mention of the two offers above Colony’s but instead he mentions that the so called “independent” directors of the board are reviewing Colony’s offer? What a joke. This is the biggest news for this company in years, and there’s not even a mention of the competing offers? Also, interesting that their grand plan with the digital kiosks isn’t turning out as well as they had hoped. No surprise there. Brazy, continues to waste shareholder money on schemes that don’t work out. Get these assets out of Brazy and Colony’s hands ASAP."

In addition to the generally bad faith to all the unit holders in not at least engaging with the other bidders, these misleading statements seem like an easy case for anyone who sold after that quarterly report and before the subsequent agreement to sell at $16.50."
