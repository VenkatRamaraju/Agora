"Currently trading above 16.50 (16.55 as I type this). Wondering if someone has caught wind about news on a proper sale process, or if it's just a technical artifact."
"LMRK and Brazy’s lack of disclosure and misdirection is incredible. Even their last quarterly report and call said that they were “reviewing” Colony’s offer with absolutely no mention that they were also negotiating exclusively with Colony to sell the assets to Colony despite having multiple competing offers. In addition to the generally bad faith to all the unit holders in not at least engaging with the other bidders, these misleading statements seem like an easy case for anyone who sold after that quarterly report and before the subsequent agreement to sell at $16.50."
"Curious if anyone has any direct experience with any of the four law firms who have so far announced investigations and possible actions against LMRK and its board. Unitholders clearly getting the short end of the stick with how this has been handled. This is a small position for me, but just on principle this deal stinks - I'm on a couple of private company boards and would absolutely expect to get sued if we sold to a related party without a full auction process for price discovery."
"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3738749-landmark-infrastructures-gp-rejects-sweetened-melody-investment-offer The conflicts committee seems to have some conflicts. ""Landmark Infrastructure Partners' (LMRK) general partner and DigitalBridge (NYSE:DBRG) rejected a request by LMRK's conflicts committee to engage with Melody Investment Advisors on a revised $22 per common unit offer received on Sept. 3, the company disclosed in a filing.During a Sept. 8 meeting, ""DigitalBridge explained that Landmark Dividend believed Melody was a direct competitor whose proposal was not actionable for a variety of reasons including because such proposal fails to value Landmark Dividend’s controlling general partner interest and incentive distribution rights and because Landmark Dividend is not evaluating third party offers,"" according to the filing. DigitalBridge and the Partnership GP also rejected the committee's request that the Partnership GP ask for valuation materials and other information from Melody.""DigitalBridge confirmed that if the Transactions were not successful, Landmark Dividend intended for the Partnership to continue as a publicly traded limited partnership,"" the company said in the filing."""
"Couple people here said LMRK is worth 25.00 yet it hasn't been over 19.00 in 5 yrs. A knowledgeable writer over on SA Trapping Value said this That gets to an annual $1.52 rate and even the highest bid is just under 11X AFFO. But the equity portion does ignore the leverage in this stock and here LMRK's valuation moves from extremely cheap, to not so cheap. The adjusted EBITDA here is on schedule to hit $70 million in 2021. That adjusted EBITDA has to service $528 million of liabilities.This doesn't count the 150 million of preferred shares outstanding.The first whiff of a lawsuit people will bail and this stock will drop back under 14.00"
The market is sniffing out that the $16.50 cozy buyout offer will not go through. LMRK unit price now above that $16.50 offer price.
"What just happened??? LMRK spiked to $18.30 this morning, then immediately dropped back in the $16.60-ish range."
...in bad faith has been in this LMRK situation. There WILL be a class action lawsuit over this if the LMRK board goes forward in accepting a lowball $16.50 bid for LMRK.
"Landmark Dividend accumulated 852,748 LMRK units between 10/7 and 10/11 on the open market. Don't sell low. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1615346/000089924321039894/xslF345X03/doc4.xml"
I had missed this article and thought it might be interesting to post here.https://dgtlinfra.com/landmark-infrastructure-1bn-digitalbridge-take-private/
"""On September 17, 2021, Melody sent to the Board a letter addressed to the Conflicts Committee (the “Melody Confirmation Letter”) informing the Conflicts Committee that the Revised Melody Proposal would no longer be time limited and confirmed that the Revised Melody Proposal would continue to remain outstanding. In any event, Landmark Dividend is not considering third party offers. If a vote of the Unitholders on the Transactions that would result in Unitholders receiving $16.50 per Common Unit is not successful, Landmark Dividend intends for the Partnership to continue as a publicly traded limited partnership."" https://seekingalpha.com/filing/5736169"
"Interesting fact: Feb 20, 2020 (pre-Covid) the share price was $17.70 and here we are getting offered %16.50."
"This is it or not?Could Melody raise their offer? The statement says ""....LD is not considering third party offers for Landmark or its assets. ....""I feel that the value is still below where it should/could be."
I'd normally be out by now - considering the imo unethical stuff that is going on. It now appears - if I understand correctly - they are trying to gobble up shares so the vote can be in favor of the 16.50 offer and it can go through. Conflicts committee saved...How low!!.
"OK we are being taken to the cleaners on valuation. As LP owners we get no say so live with it. I doubt anyone from DBRG will generously decide to pay more.How do we buy our assets back a discount? I think DBRG is a very inexpensive stock. It has sharpened its focus to a particular sector, seems undervalued relative to the peer group (and is much smaller) and is generally un followed by investors. I am probably rolling my proceeds into DBRG. Not an income play but an interesting situation.Am I nuts to think this?"
"""On August 13, 2021, a company that provides communications infrastructure services (“Party A”) submitted a letter addressed to the Conflicts Committee proposing the purchase by Party A of 100% of the wireless communications assets currently owned by the Partnership for a purchase price of $550 million in cash (the “Party A Proposal”). On August 16, 2021, Gibson Dunn had a call with Simpson. Simpson stated, on behalf of DigitalBridge, that DigitalBridge had not changed its prior position and would not consider any third party’s offer to purchase the Partnership or its assets. Simpson reiterated, on behalf of DigitalBridge and the Partnership GP, that the Board would not grant the Conflicts Committee authority to consider third-party offers or engage with any such offerors on behalf of the Partnership, including with respect to the Party A Proposal. Gibson Dunn requested that the Partnership GP provide the Conflicts Committee with any valuation materials that might be provided by Party A. No valuation materials were provided by Party A. Later in the afternoon on August 16, 2021, the Conflicts Committee met with representatives of Gibson Dunn, Evercore and Potter Anderson to discuss status updates on the transaction process, the initial draft of the Transaction Agreement, and Gibson Dunn’s call with Simpson regarding the Party A Proposal. Evercore provided certain financial observations regarding the Party A Proposal."" https://dgtlinfra.com/landmark-digitalbridge-1bn-merger-process/"
"And the justification for a 20 cent distribution will be ? ""Crown Castle expects site rental revenue growth contributions of ~5.5% from towers, ~5% from small cells, and ~3% from fiber.In 2022, Crown Castle will continue supporting customer upgrades at existing cell sites for the first phase of the U.S. 5G build-out. Indeed, this view is driven by record tower application volumes in 2021, which Crown Castle expects will translate into a 20% increase in core leasing activity for the company’s towers segment for full-year 2022, as compared to 2021."" https://dgtlinfra.com/crown-castle-q3-2021-tower-outlook-2022/"
Has there been a date set for Proxy voting in regard to the GP $16.50 lowball buyout offer for LMRK so that we can ALL be on alert to look for Proxy voting materials in our mail or email to vote NO on the Less Than Fair Value and LESS THAN THE EXISTING HIGHER OFFER OF $22.00 FROM Melody TO BUY OUT LMRK?
When there have been multiple competing bids from multiple bidders and then a press release states that LMRK will be sold to the GP of LMRK and NO THIRD PARTY BIDS WILL BE CONSIDERED you have a CLEAR Breach of Fiduciary Duty liability.Melody recently bid $16.25 and the GP of LMRK ups their bid to just .25 cents higher at $16.50 and LMRK states that no third party bids will be considered?The Breach of Fiduciary Duty class action lawsuits are going to fly.Open up the bidding to all interested parties and be fair and transparent with all bidders and bidding and obtain the highest price for OUR LMRK assets.
"Lamar Advertising (LAMR), one of the largest billboard operators in North America, just boosted its dividend 33%.This tells you there is PLENTY of room for LMRK to boost its dividend distribution back up.The recession is over LMRK management.Time to put the distribution back up to the pre-recession level.The cash flow is available even if the GP starts taking the incentive distribution and your peers in billboard advertising are signaling through their Substantial dividend increase that business is back to normal and growing again."
