Anyone else noticing a beautiful chart setting up a bull flag?
After Market rocket 
Last article yahoo news 13 days ago. With such huge news why would they not post it?
oh no! got tempted... bought more. sorry shorties
"Something very strange about the trading in this stock. Huge pop a few weeks ago on the $28M purchase order, which is about 90% of typical annual revenue. Then tanking. Big pop two days ago on some sort of FDA approval, although this news seems to be a secret, now dropping before what should be a huge revenue pipeline announced during Earnings report after the market closes today. Also the trading volume is huge compared to the published float. Very strange."
"I've searched but can't find any reason, anyone know why this is taking off?"
$3 soon
Going to $3 let’s go bought more
finnaly. got on the train in right time. lets get this train moving people

My target price is still $25
"$ CEMI Chembio Diagnostics shares are trading higher after the company announced its launch of commercial distribution of SCOV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Test, a third party COVID-19 antigen assay."
"What i don't understand is what is up with that FDA approval letter from a couple of days ago vs what they did or didn't speak about on the CC, anyone got a serious and informed take on this?"
I see …they dropped the price to collect all shares from us… hold hold hold winter is coming
Unfortunately this stock will have no chance to bounce back until the ATM offering is completed because the company will be selling stock even though the price is low.
I'm a bit confused about the behavior of the stock.1- Why CEO announcement was postponed?2- Volume not that much on earning day?3-the price is almost in hold not moving?4- All the positive news but not impacting the share?Went above $4 then bounced back?Is there some thing missing?
Green pre market 
"Announced its launch of commercial distribution of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized, patent pending, rapid point-of-care COVID-19 antigen test for use in decentralized and traditional testing settings. Product inventory is on-hand and immediately available for shipment to Chembio customers across the United States."

"CHEMBIO DIAGNOSTICS INC(NASDAQ:CEMI) shares are trading higher by 41% in Monday's pre-market session after the company announced the commercial launch of a test to differentiate between COVID-19 and the Flu.Chembio develops, manufactures, and commercializes point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests that are used to detect or diagnose diseases. The company offers tests for COVID-19, HIV and Syphilis and Zika virus."
"msn newstext: BinaxNOW, a rapid antigen test made by Abbott, can provide results in 15 minutes. Ted S. Warren/Associated Press BinaxNOW, a rapid antigen test made by Abbott, can provide results in 15 minutes.For weeks in June and July, workers at a Maine factory making one of America’s most popular rapid tests for Covid-19 were given a task that shocked them: take apart millions of the products they had worked so hard to create and stuff them into garbage bags.Soon afterward, Andy Wilkinson, a site manager for Abbott Laboratories, the manufacturer, stood before rows of employees to announce layoffs. The company canceled contracts with suppliers and shuttered the only other plant making the test, in Illinois, dismissing a work force of 2,000. “The numbers are going down,” he told the workers of the demand for testing, saying it wasn’t their fault. “This is all about money.”BinaxNOW, a rapid antigen test made by Abbott, can provide results in 15 minutes. Abbott, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images BinaxNOW, a rapid antigen test made by Abbott, can provide results in 15 minutes.As virus cases in the U.S. plummeted this spring, so did Abbott’s Covid-testing sales. But now, amid a new surge in infections, steps the company took to eliminate stock and wind down manufacturing are proving untimely — hobbling efforts to expand screening as the highly contagious Delta variant rages across the country.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from The New York TimesDemand for the 15-minute antigen test, BinaxNOW, is soaring again as people return to schools and offices. Yet Abbott has reportedly told thousands of newly interested companies that it cannot equip their testing programs in the near future. CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens locations have been selling out of the at-home version, and Amazon shows shipping delays of up to three weeks. Abbott is scrambling to hire back hundreds of workers......“Businesses crave certainty, and pandemics don’t lend certainty to demand,” said Stephen S. Tang, chief executive of OraSure Technologies, which in the midst of the testing slump in June received emergency F.D.A. authorization for its own rapid test, InteliSwab, long in development. But the company is not yet supplying retail stores.Meanwhile, Dr. Sean Parsons, chief executive of Ellume, the Australian manufacturer of a competitor rapid test, said this week that demand was 1,000 times what it had forecast and that it was racing to set up a U.S. plant.Hopefully Chembio can step up quickly. The harvest is ripe. Opportunity is knocking."

"For confirmed orders of $28M and $4M, the market cap is just $69M. Probably deserves better valuation. But then, my opinion is biased as I own shares and sold Puts."
"35 million shares did not just trade for no reason, something big will be announced again real soon, most likely tomorrow."
Is this good or verry good news?
Benzinga was not lying…https://www.fda.gov/media/151249/download
When is the earning date?CNBC says 05 AugYahoo says 06 Augwhich is correct?
"For all those confused but what is going on, they have an FDA EUA approved kit primed to deal with the blatant DELTA rise, here’s a link if you are confused, the er was actually great b/c the big pint was 28million contract yet to be shipped,  https://chembio.com/products/status-covid-19-flu-usa/"
"Better than Moderna? Vaccinations are needed once a year perhaps? But for testing we are talking few times a year, worldwide ! Just imagine!!"
Give people some time to digest the news.
"So why is it now exploding after hours? Not complaining as I loaded 60K shares today, but just wondering why 10 minutes changed?"
"Remember the company is still diluting, thus they will be selling heavily into today's spike which will greatly surpress it from rising."

Net of the placement fee and other transaction costs, the Company realized estimated net proceeds of approximately $34.7 million4.43/stock "
With only 20.3 million sharesThis company would make a great buyout. They have approved products and their covid test also test for flu. I think the only test out. Along with the other test kits. For $30-35 a share someone would be getting a bargain for 600-700 million. Just my opinion not financial advice.
"So... who's going to apologize first to me for just warning you guys nicely with real data, real math and real facts? Be a man, step up to the plate. They may be a good company one day, IF they can sell their products and lower their expenses."

SEC investigating the news release of the large order (which DIDN’T SHIP) right before the did their stock offering???!
Well what else can I do except holding?Bought at $5. :(
Shortis in best case can make a 100% which is almost impossible. We investors can make 1000% and more depends how smart and patient we are. Obviously who is on the right side.
This will be going above $ 10 by the end of the year...a bit patience and your investmnt will be tripled. Great potential in the company.
What really concerns me is the cash burn. Been through that too many times and in this case I just feel like dilution is around the corner. This company is for real but it's going to take money and time to reap the rewards.

Well as expected they took all available shares to be shorted. All I can say in one day they will regret their actions. Lets make em pay
"Looks like we're at the bottom or close to it.So, they raised $36.9 million in July, in 8 trading days by selling 8.3 million shares with average price over $4 per share? So, now, they must be almost done with the ATM and started shipping the $28 million purchase order to Brazil? Anyway, Covid and variants like Delta are not going away anytime soon. So, I'm taking a small position. I will be looking for next PRs, such as ATM is complete, EUA announcement, purchase orders etc. GL!"
"Will CEMI show that they will be a big winner, with future earnings? Also, Is ATM complete? Not sure yet, so will check on ER today."
it can cross 6 today
I heard about CEMI the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
shall I buy at 3.3?
"hold your hand, we have huge orders that can be filled with a FDA emergency blessing. Its going to lead to a permanent if the results are as good as they say."
No matter what finacials are coming and the purchase orders for 32mil where already announced and this company valued at 70 mil hmm any else sees the problem with this low stock price?
All small or bigs medical companies are going more than 500 % up since Covid -19 started .. only this company going down.. I have shares here and I’m questioning the performance of the company management … :(

"From the CDC today 27 July...""Additionally, CDC encouraged the labs to choose a multiplexed test that can be used to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from influenza viruses. Such tests began hitting the market last fall but had limited use because of a flu season that was almost non-existent. With much of the global economy reopened and more lax social distancing practices, however, some experts are expecting a busier upcoming flu season, potentially making such multiplexed tests valuable tools."""
looks just like geovax pre run
This has the perfect recipe for explosion - covid cases rising tremendously -they have enough cash to run without any order for a year (but they already have orders) - a few EUA testing kitsDo your own DD
That Er report was mumbo jumbo liability cover more than anything. There preliminary report was great. Check it out. Holding  for the next spike.
"fundamentals won't matter until ATM shorts cover their big short positions.. They may let CEMI run at some point later > Company raised $36.9 million of gross proceeds thru ATM in July. As of now, they have plenty of cash on hand to easily pay off ALL the debt & liabilities, if they want. (Long term Debt is only $18 mil).> Covid testing will be needed more and more, as infections arr rising even among vaccinated people.> Company can issue positive PR anytime.. it may not happen today or not even this week though..> Many bag holders bought in $4 thru $7 during the last 10 days (not me, thank God)! But, they could make $$ if they buy low to lower cost basis. > ATM almost done ; ATM shorts will cover soon.. Until then buy low if you can and press snooze button.

Do you think that investors which just pump in 36.9 millions want to lose their money? They know what is coming!!!

Lets to be fair:the BS management is still doing a good job shipping product.The production is still in it early stage...less than two week after order confirmed.It requires more cap spending during this extraordinary time to get production running.Supply chain issues are everywhere...ask any manufacturer who does not have one!B/S management will not tell you the reality...but this one did
sprt took all the attention more news coming load up n sell high burn shorts n stack cash
I am holding
Chembio Diagnostics upside said related to FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for LumiraDx UK Ltd.'s LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ab Test. CEMI is a partner.

Looking forward to the 2nd quarter report today. Even with all the manipulation and deception by market makers CEMI has the goods that couldn't be more timely with COVID 19 test kits.

Can someone please explain why with so much good news this stock could not maintain the price and fell to these values? thanks

"hold shares the next six months will be interesting for cemi, delta is playing big roll , testing picking up big time as carriers for hospitals extremely busy and testing sights opening up again. the drop today comes from daytraders looking for big pop after earnings . it did not happen so they sell their shares and go on"
Please sell even lower so I can buy more
CEMI has an incredible growth in the future with the COVID-19 tests the market is growing rapidly I see the stock $8 soon
cemi up big today a penny
"Hello, everyone...just checking. After CEMI E/R numbers were released, I decided to sell almost all of my shares... I heard a buch of excuses, lack of enthusiam and lack of confidence. Well, I am glad I did so, I was able to stop my cash bleeding and recoup myself and my loses. I still believed that CEMI is a great company to own but I don't feel confident for the upper management commitment and yes, they should be removed. Moving forward, I will comeback and make an impact and as soon we can vote for a new management for the board of directors, we should all jump in a make our voice be heard, as of this post we are 4223 strong and we can make a significant change."
this is still dirt cheap might grab more cus its all going to be good news from here shout out the delta variant our sales will be huge this quarter
"EUA, great!!! Upgrade, Great! New test, great! You need sales orders to drive this baby up. Credibility is in the numbers. Sales of tests, or company to a larger entity. Sold all my shares at 3, buying slowly. Since this thing tends to drift down."
"CEMI is in quiet period, they cant say nothing until earnings are reported. But that doesnt mean someone way up there found out something and bought millions of shares before Friday. So hold on."
I just saw they are advertising for a slew of job openings. My guess would be they have the orders to justify the hiring . I hope
"Today is the day for CEMI, company is expecting very good fiscal year 20-21, in lot of research regarding testing kit company got success. The best thing is that they got FDA approval for all of those testing kit for Covid, HIV and Zika virus. As FDA approved testing kit, they won the confidence of retail as well as wholesale market. Also delta variant has been spiked again in the world, WHO announced that now delta variant is affecting more thn 90 countries in the world, the demand for CEMI equipment will be increasing. Company has spent lot in R&D, but all that R&D efforts were converted into product, so they must have high R&D expense, but earnings will be way more thn expense. So as of now lot of positive factors are in favour of CEMI… Future is bright for this company. Also it held the support level of $3.30 yesterday as I said earlier in my post. Today it will breakout $4 easily. If some positive announcement comes in earning report, we may expect $6-$7 tomorrow. If we see the history during last 6 months, CEMI touched above $5 level couple of times. All the best to all holders."
"Massive news and major milestone for the company. Revenue will flow in big time now. Very undervalued with a small market cap of only $70 million. This could easily trade 5-10x current valuation and still be cheap. Other test companies are trading in the BILLIONS and this is $70 Million....haha. See you at the top folks, todays news is a game changer! $10-$20 near term!"
Folks- what is the spike about ? Anybody ?
"$CEMI After this upgrade, Chembio Diagnostics' three analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$54m in 2021. This would be a substantial 56% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Before the latest update, the analysts were foreseeing US$36m of revenue in 2021. It looks like there's been a clear increase in optimism around Chembio Diagnostics, given the great increase in revenue forecasts."

$CEMI HIV Diagnostics Market Revenue to Cross USD 760 Mn by 2027: Global Market Insights Inc.
Good morning everyone.. I wish great day.. my advice to you hold hold hold hold
100 dollar incoming
Buying $CEMI at 2.8-3 is a low risk high reward play considering its recent orders worth millions. Think about it 
2 bucks is the support now
"The more they short, the more they have to cover…retailers are not going to sell. They will only hold."
I have a gut feeling another big PR will be released tomorrow morning.
"CEMI has published on its website home page that they are going to launch 4 different rapid kits approved by FDA...one is COVID 19/FLU A & B, another one DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil and Europe. Third launching is DPP HIV-Syphilis The First & Only FDA Approved HIV-Syphilis Rapid Test in USA and Europe. Fourth one is First Rapid Zika IGM with FDA 510(K) clearance. ...In tomorrow's conference call they must announce this. It wasn't there on home page promo. It was recently added. So, company has bright future and will grow."
"Added 50,000 LPTX for Monday - gastric cancer abstract Sunday night It will pop huge Monday premarket $CEI $SPRT $CEMI"
"$8 guys $CEMI 12-month price forecasts for Chembio Diagnostics Inc have a median target of 8.00, with a high estimate of 8.00 and a low estimate of 8.00. The median estimate represents a +199.63% increase from the last price of 2.67."
"Anyone think the company is still selling shares via their announced ATM program into this rally? Thus why its drifted lower since the spike after the market opened, I see it all the time. I would like to buy back into this company, but I will not until they announce dilution is over."
"I got wind of this from a buddy a few days ago who himself got the ticker from the rumor mill. After looking at the financials leading up to the multiple promos this year, I stayed clear of the company and now the ER shows the company is in even worse shape than they had been letting on. Negative margins and not enough capital for the next 12 months after diluting shareholders with equity financing to the tune of $30,000,000...TWICE in the past year. Wow!""Without giving effect to the prospect of raising additional capital pursuant to the ATM Agreement, increasing product revenue in the near future or executing other mitigating plans, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its required financial obligations, including its rent, debt service and other obligations due to third parties. The existence of these conditions raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve-month period following the date the second quarter financial statements are to be issued."""
I wonder why the company has not released a formal PR stating what is said in the Benzinga article released yesterday regarding FDA emergency use authorization? Maybe they are waiting to announce it with earnings tomorrow for some reason?
$28 Million COVID Diagnostic Test Order $CEMI was nice
"$CEMI Covid19 Chembio Diagnostics shares are trading higher after the company announced its launch of commercial distribution of SCOV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Test, a third party COVID-19 antigenassay."
give us 1 good news....and this one will go to the moooooooooon.
"This is a typical Short Squeeze Scenario, the shorts try to keep price down and once it begins running up they cannot cover in time before they start losing money. Those prices can become astronomical, but first the fight for the SP to make movement in either direction. Today we fight to stay and hold the $3 line or at worst $2.75"

As people digest the report and we have a CC that will give better visibility on guidance we should be moving higher in the coming days...
Why it doesn’t rise up ?
Still baffled that CEO did not highlight the EUA approval. What am i missing? Thats huge news for now and future.
"$CEMI The 1 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Chembio Diagnostics Inc have a median target of 8.00, with a high estimate of 8.00 and a low estimate of 8.00. The median estimate represents a +166.67% increase from the last price of 3.00."
Bought more this will hit $3 soon
"-- Achieved second quarter 2021 total revenue of $6.5 million and product revenue of $3.9 million, representing growth of 26% and 4%, respectively, compared to the prior year period -- Initiated shipments under a $28.3 million purchase order for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Tests received from Bio-Manguinhos to support the urgent needs of Brazil's Ministry of Health for delivery during 2021 -- Received a $4.0 Million HIV Test purchase order supported by The Global Fund for shipment to Ethiopia into early 2022 -- Continued clinical trials for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System, intended for use in applications for a new EUA and a 510(k) -- Launched an at the market (""ATM"") offering of common stock and raised $36.9 million of gross proceeds in July SO IN SHORT a 28 million dollar shipment alone will literally quadruple profits before end of 2021 LMAO!!! OH and EUA confirmation (source E*TRADE)!!"

@ Diamond Hands - I know their sales channel well - very well (employment with anither firm).Abbott is cleaning their clock…. Check the large orders…. None are firm and paid for with traditional funding. I am very negative on CEMI (my optimism of 15 months ago evaporated)
trust the proccess believe me guys....
Over 50 percent of yesterday's volume was short sales. Let's squeeze this up.

The whole stock exchange is sick infected by HF.
"As I told earlier, it maintains the level, it won’t break down below $3.30…around 2 PM or in power hour , chances that it will touch $4.00 easily and tomorrow before result. Result is expecting much better this time as lot of testings done in last quarter and they got couple of big orders of millions. Future is bright for this company."
$3 tomorrow
I feel it will rocket soon
Callmelisab muted...
They’ve already capitalized almost $40m of the 60m offer?
Why are they not issuing any PR? Should we assume that ATM is still not complete?
"The report is better than I had expected and there is a pile of revenue from recent contracts in the pipeline to be booked going forward, so more than happy with where we are going here..."
Would you accept $15 taking over offer?
"FYI so far there is zero squeeze going on but it will happen. An upgrade, some huge orders and forward looking positive news from the CEO. Yup things are looking much better."
"I believe in this so much short term, that i have many options call at $10 and $15 strikeout price. Been slowly adding more and more everyday last two weeks"
I am in for the long run!!! This testing will be in every school n the world very soon!!! And many other places!!!
Now is time to earn money. With capital rase and big orders we are going to bright future. Target price 15$.

Who in their right mind announces they not sure of being a going concern after getting a contract and in middle of global pandemic. Fire the $&)(;*.
"I bought this because, I see the huge revenue increase in their financials."
"Tomorrow and AH will be CRAZY, they will most likely announce the FDA approval after ER. Er won’t be amazing but that’s why it’s valued at $70mil but that FDA approval and another good order will take it to $25+ a share short term"
"CEMI looks semi-conscious only.. The ER checkup at 4:30 could revive it back to life or put it in life support!This could be a keeper like SAVA, but not sure yet."
a great stock so dont sell it otherwise you will regret it

This is interesting; right after I mentioned that they were having a job fair on LI
"Market selloff expected, we probably need to go cash"
Shorts will get burned monday MARK IT $CEMI - Holding short over the weekend is like your ex holding your gold bars while she / he has a mate and they are nearly homeless.
HF’s wanted to get in low - hence price after hours is so low. Tomorrow we go back up above $3.50
"This news is a game changer, no need to additional instruments to do tests."
This will fly in pm... once the word is spread the game will begin
The FDA at one point granted Emergency Use Authorization to (NASDAQ: $CEMI ) #COVID19 #antibody test. Chembio Diagnostics also received $28.3 Million Purchase Order from Bio-Manguinhos for DPP #SARSCoV2 Antigen Tests in Brazil
"Covid tide is rising again, governments and institutions are gonna wake up soon and put orders. think to how it reduces the healthcare labor force having a fast response gadget like that. No logistics and lab analysis. No waiting at home! More efficiency overall. it's a matter of time."
The volume is over 28 million shares and the outstanding shares is around 20 million limit Sharis up to $100 per share and you’ll see the stock $10 very soon￼
