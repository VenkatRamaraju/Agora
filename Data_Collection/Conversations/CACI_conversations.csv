"This quarters stock earnings will be negatively impacted by the Afghanistan withdrawal. Going forward from this quarters earnings, each subquential quarters earnings should be much better. Overall, CACI's PE, PEG, and PB are all very low for stocks in this group. For myself, this stock is a long term hold and buy on any weakness. Storing up acorns now while analysts debate how much the Afghanistan withdrawal will effect the stock. The future looks great."

"I was working 10 years for this company and left just 1 year ago.all my 401K was in CACI stock and I made good money from it.The company and the management are solid and CACI stock never disappointed me. It may go down and up but eventually deliver what was expected. Company is doing acquisitions on the regular basis.The only big drop in the stock may happen if Biden will be elected, other then that I continue to keep this stock."
Government opportunities are stalling with Trump. Executives are not in place to make the larger purchases. Most government contractors will see revenue reductions for the next two years. May last longer as many Administrative officials have not been announced. Market is reacting. Plus CACI is high for this sector at the current multiple. Could be up to a 10% adjustment until next quarter. Then lower if budget cuts hold and business is not released by the Trump team.
This is the most unpopular stock I've ever come across. No media attention or clout while profitable and growing.

What is going on with this stock?
New to stock. I'm wondering if at around 215 this is a good entry point. Most of the brokerages have targets of 250. Any information of forecasted earnings and revenues appreciated.

Been looking into investing in the cyber security space and found CACI to be one of the better companies based on its PE ratio and finances but does it have a definite edge over its rivals in the field ? Any insights will be much appreciated. If I’m not able to decide on a single company then will just invest in either CIBR or HACK
another great quarter.....another beat and raise.....another down day post earnings lol....this will be 300 within 6 months
Why Andrew Lyft of Citron thinks this is bankruptcy in few years. Looking to short or Buy puts. https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-Acceptance-Corp-The-Black-Swan-Event.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3hGsgV2cGwLRzf13A3qhB7-68HZwl18QkJVX5JwByqJGpnpVx2xEfC7G0

"I'm not sure how this trades at such low valuations while companies like Palantir, which aren't profitable, are 10 times the market cap. Unreal this isn't in the media or getting any part of spotlight. I guess ppl don't like massive free cashflows and stock buybacks?"
