CACI International (CACI) 2020 Guidance Tops Consensus at Mid-Point
Great Quarter. This company will definitely be a buyout target. GLTA
Big announcement on stock repurchase. This will fly in 2021.
Getting ready for the earnings report after the close. The earnings forecast is 3.89 EPS on revenue of 1.50 billion this quarter. Last year earnings came in at 3.67. Most of the aerospace and defense contractors who have reported thus far are missing on revenue estimates. Hoping that CACI can surprise.
"Russian hack attack is a big deal. US was caught flat footed - the Russians have been roaming through IT files since March. Not sure how CACI is impacted, but news sources say that Russians were particularly focused on cyber security firms."
This is the most unpopular stock I've ever come across. No media attention or clout while profitable and growing.
New to stock. I'm wondering if at around 215 this is a good entry point. Most of the brokerages have targets of 250. Any information of forecasted earnings and revenues appreciated.
CACI reached an all time high at 277.20

Looks like this company is one of many where funds are kickbacked to political buddies of congress. With inside info they rake in billions on options with 0 risk.
Another great quarter. This company is prime for a buyout. GLTA
Been looking into investing in the cyber security space and found CACI to be one of the better companies based on its PE ratio and finances but does it have a definite edge over its rivals in the field ? Any insights will be much appreciated. If I’m not able to decide on a single company then will just invest in either CIBR or HACK

"This quarters stock earnings will be negatively impacted by the Afghanistan withdrawal. Going forward from this quarters earnings, each subquential quarters earnings should be much better. Overall, CACI's PE, PEG, and PB are all very low for stocks in this group. For myself, this stock is a long term hold and buy on any weakness. Storing up acorns now while analysts debate how much the Afghanistan withdrawal will effect the stock. The future looks great."
"I'm not sure how this trades at such low valuations while companies like Palantir, which aren't profitable, are 10 times the market cap. Unreal this isn't in the media or getting any part of spotlight. I guess ppl don't like massive free cashflows and stock buybacks?"
"At current valuation and 88% institutional ownership this stock is a solid bet, but it seems SO manipulated. Should be breaking through, not grinding sideways."
CACI is up 5.15% to 172.45
Great quarter and guidance raised!
Management convinced me that they are on the path to expanding revenues and earnings. The backlog grew to 23.9 billion even with clearing the 1.1 billion reduction due to the Afghanistan withdrawal. Also in the questions and answers it was stated that here in first quarter the balance sheet had the fullest impact on the Afghanistan withdrawal. Meaning that future quarters balance sheets will have much lesser effects. I really like their forecasted free cash flow of at least 720 billion.

Nice beat on Earnings and small miss on Rev. I think we still go higher from this level. GLTA
"A recognized leader, CACI under Mengucci’s direction has developed products and solutions that allow defense and intelligence customers to transform how they approach the convergence of signals intelligence, electronic warfare and cyber with a product called ARES. Mengucci was instrumental in the creation of CACI’s SkyTracker Technology Suite to detect and defeat rogue drones, which was named “Best-in-Class” among Industry Innovators at Washington Technology’s Government Innovation Awards."
"I was offered a job with this company long ago but went to Deloitte instead. However, I did buy CACI stock and have no regrets."
"I was working 10 years for this company and left just 1 year ago.all my 401K was in CACI stock and I made good money from it.The company and the management are solid and CACI stock never disappointed me. It may go down and up but eventually deliver what was expected. Company is doing acquisitions on the regular basis.The only big drop in the stock may happen if Biden will be elected, other then that I continue to keep this stock."
