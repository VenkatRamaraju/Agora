"Warning to Investors & Employees!Looking at the members of the Board of Directors I would never invest OR work at this company. Kenneth C. Bockhorst holds three titles? Chairman, CEO & President? One individual holding three positions is not good corporate governance. Then again it is hardly surprising looking at the other board members. Todd Teske is also a member of the Board and sits on the corporate governance committee & compensation committee. Teske is the same man who like Bockhorst, also held (past tense as he was fired) the positions of CEO, President & Chairman of the board at the now bankrupt Briggs and Stratton corporation. In Teske’s case he managed to single handedly run that once very profitable company into the ground resulting in bankruptcy. In the process of destroying a once profitable company he managed to line his own pockets with millions of shareholder dollars. He paid himself and his pals $5.1 million dollars in bonuses rather than pay the interest owed to bond holders just before filing for chapter 11. He awarded himself bonuses instead of funding the company’s pension plan, handing it over to the government so taxpayers are now left to fund it. He left shareholders with nothing, and other creditors expected to get at best $0.10 on the dollar. He took away retiree health and wellness benefits. Benefits which they earned. He stole from everyone to line his own pockets with millions. So this is the man selected to sit on the Board of Badger Meter and provide guidance as to corporate governance and compensation? It would be laughable if it were not so shameful. I would steer clear of this company if I were an investor. If I were a supplier I would make sure to get payment in advance. If I were an employee, I would be looking for work elsewhere. Clearly they have very poor judgment and not much in the way of ethics."
