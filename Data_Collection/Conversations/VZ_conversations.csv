"sup folks! im jumping on board this delicious beauty 1st thing this morning, it looks like nothing to gain dont it, but uhhh, i beg to differ, in fact, i predict VZ begins a multi-pulsr cycle within 2-3 weeks MAX thatll add a bundle of joy to this sleeping dragon...till then, do enjoy and party forth!!!"
"This is the bottom, BUY!"
What can make VZ go up?
"Usually, even after good earnings VZ lags since all analysts care about is subscriber growth.This time is different. Great job VZ!""Verizon said it added 275,000 postpaid wireless phone subscribers vs. analyst estimates for a 165,000 gain. In the year earlier period, Verizon added 173,000 postpaid wireless phone customers""""In the consumer business, Verizon recorded retail postpaid phone churn of 0.65%, one of its lowest rates yet as a limited number of consumers switched wireless providers"""
Will it be Thursday sept 2 or sept 9 ?I'll go with .64 as my guess
Bleeding so much
VZ = the new 10 year bond.
"Give this dog time to react and free itself from the heavy option trading activity placed before it released its earnings. Since most investors knew earnings would be relatively good, big money was made trading this bird with both calls early in the day and then puts to finish the day with a golden seal. That's why long term investors are better off when earnings are not so easily figured out and there is an element of surprise. Still most likely, this bird will fly above $56.75 within a few days. No so shabby all things considered and yes, time to move back to defensive stocks"
Good safe stock at a good safe price. I’m parking some cash here now that market is super bubbly. Low risk low reward. But 4.5 percent ain’t bad.
Just keep buying this under 55. This is a 5 percent Cd and will be fine if/when market pulls back
$WIMI $MNMD $VZ Hold long and strong. Never sell and become wealthy
I love this stock's fundamentals and opportunity but wow it won't ever move.
Why does one own Verizon? Only reason I can see is the dividend. The stock has been flat for 5 years…
Yahoo deletes anything which may be critical of Hans or the employees
"Some support @ 55.5, buying opportunities, safe investment."
Debt is fine when you use it to buy assets. Assets that hold value and deliver cash flow. Enterprise Value!
Told you yesterday all gains would be gone at close.Good earnings report do nothing.Someone manipulates this stock
I have been loading UP under 55. This will be a port in the storm whenever a market pullback happens.
Does this thing EVER do anything else besides go down on a daily basis?
What a bunch of B S the market at all time highs and this dog lags
Where is the bottom? When will it go back to $56?
"I own too much of this dog, but the dividend pays my rent.Like to see some cap gains so I can have a bett lunch."
"Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, this too shall one day reach 60 again."
2 weeks to go up .50 and 2 minutes to drop.50
VZ is on sale at these prices. Tripled my position today. And did the same for T. Quick easy money this week.
"all of you complaining about the stock not going up, please sell your shares so it will climb and then complain. All stocks go up after you sell, I know, been there, done that...lol"
Record Earnings and stock price does nothing. CEO needs to go. Upper management needs to go. Need to clean house. Stock been in the 50's for years
Wonder how much more money Verizon would have if they stopped advertising fios in areas that can't get fios?
"At this level, VZ has more up risk than down risk."
Just bought 600 shares was it a mistake we will soon see
Seems like this stock should be double what it is…..
VZ stock has a mean target price of 61.64. This means analysts expect the stock to rise 11.5% over the next 12 months.
"vz very good earnings report, vz worth $80 per share, vz will be history high. inflation was good news for vz, prices war have been end, because all wireless carriers raised prices, compared vz t and tmus almost same prices."
Why Verizon is still a buy? 1) It has a Dividend yield of 4.61%2) A reasonable P/E ratio.3) Strong demand for 5G smartphones
I am predicting a bust upwards upon announcement of earnings---say 10%--within 10 days
Looks like new 52 week low coming. I’ll be adding. This is where I’m going to park a decent chunk of cash for when market pullback happens.
Verizon expands 5G Business Internet - now available in 42 cities with speeds up to 400 Mbps.
VZ CEO Hans presented a positive outlook & high momentum for the second half. JD Power and RootMetrics named VZ the best network. The biggest upgrade to 5G is in full swing. Won a DoD defense contract. Innovating the first 4G connected drone in the U.S. market. Expands Innovative Learning platform to schools.
Relax Att will go up in September when the market drops as it always does They will pile in for safety
Pretty amazing that VZ market cap is the same as it was a year ago. Is there no growth left? Buy for the yield with a payout ratio at 50%. Better than money market
Hans is a lightweight running a heavyweight company.
Figures
"$WIMI $VZ $AMD remember peeps, focus in the long term."
VZ - Smoking Hot Stock? …… NOT 
"VZ is the leader of all carriers and will remain so . Yes ! Stock price fluxuates and any one with half a brain would realize why it is down now . Because of all the spectrum investment made . Have no doubt bout their leadership . They are the best in the business . Once 5G get's into full swing with residential , mobile and ll the companies and government contracts . Everyone else will be lost in their dust . One other thing is that this crazy meme movement will be crushed and they know to stay away from a high powered company like VZ ."
Buy under $55!
"For those of you complaining and |3i+ching about the current price of the stock, keep this in mind: Over 75% (yes, that is correct) of the stock is owned by INSTITUTIONS. That doesn't even count some of the larger individual shareholders who also own this stock. Bottom line ... I'm willing to bet 90%+ of this stock is in strong, stable hands and isn't going anywhere. So what you're seeing traded is the 10% (400 million shares = 10%) that's out there being actively traded. So it's not going to move much. And if it really starts to drop, you'll see some of the 90%+ crowd step in and add to their positions. That is what is going on here. You're welcome."
Will the dividend increase at all???
"Not sure whether or not to pick up more at this price point. Getting to feel like 1987, and if so, the end of September and October would be prime time to pick up more. I thought we might be hearing of a dividend increase but maybe not this year."
"It's a much better idea (and safer) to buy a dividend mutual fund or ETF, than buying a single stock like VZ."
"It's unfortunate that your opinion of customer service is less then perfect. My darling wife is on the phone with VZ customer service sometimes for an hour of more and they are patient, friendly, and determined to solve an issue. The stock is safer then and pays more then our US T bills."
"Maybe in the next 3.5 trillion dollar,deficit spending bill,VZ can pick-up some government contract money?Its only money that taxpayers employed by for-profit companies work for.The beauty of the system is that the government can always spend more!Drunken Democrats,re-making the USA!"
Schwab hasn’t paid the VZ dividend that was supposed to be paid yesterday. 
Does the insane amount of debt on the balance sheet worry anyone... $160B... to me this limits the stock price and any dividend increase... Is the Dividend safe... It's the only reason I own it..thoughts?
this has been going sideways for months. only reason to hold is decent dividend.

"Verizon – Goldman Sachs upgraded Verizon to “buy” from “neutral,” noting underperformance due to a number of different concerns but ultimately concluding that key success factors for Verizon remain unchanged."
Why is this always dead in the water?
"Bought option lot at close, we should go up tomorrow, easy 55.5"
"The move back up will continue as we approach the x-dividend date. Nothing new or unexpected. Same old stock pattern repeating itself. Just buy, hold and watch it go up."
Dividend watch: Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is forecast to boost its quarterly dividend payout to $0.64 per share from a prior level of $0.6275. The new yield of around 4.68% would be above the five-year average VZ yield of 4.47%.
OK VZ time to turn this up and into the 60’s. Itsa no-brainer! Where are the buyers?
Bought two truck loads right at closing today.
The amount of Debt put on the Balance Sheet in the last 18 months.... sadly this stock is going no where but down. The stock is trending down at a rate higher than the dividend. Sure we get a 4.5% div... but the stock looses 7%.... definitely not getting ahead.... I've held my shares 10yrs... should have just been in the QQQ.
It's on fire! I'm now down just $2 per share!
"Diamond in the rough. Your downside risk is maximum 7%. Predictable earning power, that's even growing. Buffet see's value. Collect 4.5% via bond-utility proxy. Or go buy a 60 P/E growth stock that has potential to run 50% higher but can also tank 50%. Can U afford to lose 50%?"
Why are we stuck at $56?
Will the 1 Trillion infrastructure bill help VZ?
"Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is often considered an evergreen defensive stock. It owns the largest wireless network in America, it pays a high forward dividend yield of 4.4%, and the stock trades at just 11 times forward earnings. It's also raised its dividend annually for 14 straight years."
The DOW is up 200 and this stock is only up .06???
"At this price range,you know it is a very safe stock. $VENA $QS $VZ"
"Does anyone know the exact date Verizon will jettison Media? If you read the dribble on W@h0O these days it's sad. Now they're capitalizing the word ""Black"" but keeping ""white"" in lower case. Also constantly highlighting white on black crime (less than 10% of serious crime per recent FBI statistics), but zero mention of black on other races (35%) and black on black (50%). Why is that? Trying to paint a picture that isn't true? I have to admit, I'm rooting more and more for viruses...it may be time for the human race to check out on this planet and let nature evolve the next generation of being for this planet. We're just messing it up."
Will Verizon provide deep state surveillance capability?
"VZ common stock has been a pretty reliable 20 year bond. The price now is where it was in 2000 and has paid a reliable dividend, currently over 4%.I will be very happy if VZ can maintain its current stock price for another 20 years while paying a nice dividend( aka interest payment)"
News: Air National Guard (U.S. Dept of Defence) awards Verizon $78.8M contract.
Sure would of liked to of seen a 20% drop in share price today and then rebound on Tuesday. Oh well
"20%of the workforce is out ""sick"" on a daily basis 1 THE CULTURE WITHIN THAT COMPANY MUST BE CHANGED. Mass layoffs of the workforce and upper management are necessary to start steering the ship in the right direction. I'm sure that those employees on this site that are part of that culture will disagree but drastic times require drastic measures. Remember General Electric and General Motors ?

This stock price is what happens when you hire as VZ's CEO someone who failed miserably at Ericsson. Why did VZ have to import a leftist loser from Europe? ... and give him a $40 million golden parachute as part of his package too?
VZ your in it for that Dividend look at the swings in the chart plenty of opportunities to get in and add on to your paycheck every quarter let’s face it we’re Lucky to have one of these in are portfolio you definitely know there not going anywhere keep buying those dips and enjoy your paychecks
I am thinking of buying shares soon. waiting for a little lower price and will hold to collect dividends. Used to own it 20 years ago. Any helpful input would be greatly appreciated.
"The Russians or a rightwing extremist cyber infiltrator has taken over the DJI conversation board. Only rightwing views are allowed,. all others are deleted. They especially like bashing our president. I suspect Russians."
I’ve owned VZ for a long time. I’ll be the first to admit that it is a boring stock. TMUS has taken away many customers and many of my own friends have switched because of the cheaper price. I keep VZ because of the dividend but I am disappointed in it’s lack of growth. TMUS even has better commercials.
"Personally, in these uncertain times with the market going all over the place at any given time, I really don't mind VZ going up and down a little. Sure beats big swings, plus a nice 4.5% dividend. I look at it as a CD or a Bond..Not to many places were you can recieve that kind of interest and being able to rest at night. Any buy in the 55 range IMO is a keeper and if it goes significantly lower, buy the dip...like I did today..."

"Sold this yesterday for a small profit. I do believe in Verizon stock long term, but in the short term there was a better opportunity for this money. I will re-enter VZ at the right price. The price has been consistent yet stagnant in this crazy market so this has felt like a higher-yield savings account. Long-term winner as they continue to pay down their large debt amount."
This will go up after every thing else crashes Thursday after the feds speak
"American households are continuing to convert to streaming, so people have had to upgrade their download speeds and buy new routers. That money will fall directly to VZ's bottom line. 58-60 is coming."
Enough already!!! Time to reverse.
"Bye VZ, got my money back, it's not going up for a reason, still figuring out..."
Thoughts at getting in at current price?
VZ needs to reverse the trend and go up a few days.
"Inflation is coming and that's a bad thing. VZ has seen headcount go from 240k in 2006 to 132k last year. Because salary expense is going to go up per capita, the improvements VZ has made in revenue per employee from wireless growth will cushion the blow. Thank you Fairpoint and FTR old shareholders wherever you are. Stay the course, lash yourself to the deck and ride this double-hull tanker thru the storm."

This company makes more money than they know what to do with
Is it manipulation or value trap? Need to go back to $56.
"Dow up 600+, VZ down?????"
"The issue is debt, debt, debt!!"
"VZ is safe, verified by the earnings and guidance. It's about 5G, extra low PE/ value, plus 4.5% yield, with the high inflation, VZ is much better than cash in the bank."
"low pe, huge future based on wireless for driverless cars and passengers plus moat (spectrum)= takeover target for Berkshire hathaway"
"...and so it begins.VZ blew it out this morning, surprising analysts with net gains in subscribers. I don't find this surprising. I did something that most investors have not done. I went and subscribed to all three major cell companies, using the same phone (iPhone 12). I chose similar plans. Then as I traveled, I used all 3 phones in a number of markets throughout the US (16 at my last count). I kept a journal on call drops, quality, availability of signal (more on this later), and so on. The winner? VZ by a large margin. T was second, and a distant third was TMUS. TMUS, when it worked, had solid 5G, but it was spotty. T really isn't a legitimate 5G player (yet). VZ, when it was 5G, had flames shooting out of the phone, especially in downtown areas. That's why I use VZ now as my home internet provider with 5G. It kills it over Spectrum and Wow. Just kills it.Warren Buffett knows what he's doing on this one. VZ will be a darling for years to come, once Ericcson and the tower companies get all of their 5G upgrades in place for VZ. Give it 1-2 years, then watch out."
Buy now. 56+ coming when market pulls back. Plus a 4.6 percent yield.
Verizon has a golden opportunity for a commercial.A TMUS customer opens a letter from TMUS that notifies him/her or the data breach exposing his phone to being hijacked.The customer looks terrified and then the kicker. When Cheap goes Wrong! Verizon a company you can trust.

9% over two years in just dividends. recession proof stock with plenty of upside. one of the best deals out there if you want a stable rock in this sea of an overvalued market.

"And I thought KO was a boring stock. Holy cow. HOWEVER with a trailing P/E of about 11, a book value of 17.8 a P/B of 3.13 and a 4.5% Div. this is a good defensive play when the market corrects. I just hope I can stay awake that long zzz"

I added 500 shares of VZ to my portfolio today.
use the dip to buy don't cry
VZ is a utility company now.Buy for the dividends in your IRA.
"The SP should be above $60. Strong earnings, upgraded guidance and most importantly nice revenue growth should move this to above 52 week highs towards $65. Let’s see if VZ gets the love it deserves. And thank you for dividends landing soon."
The stock doesn't move and the divy can't keep up with inflation
So 4.5% dividend is good with inflation at 5% excluding food and energy ?
Verizon 5G Internet is expanding rapidly to 42 US cities and is proving an excellent alternative to cable internet for US businesses.
"Verizon stock was 55.47 on this day a year ago. Today, after a year it is still at the same exact price 55.47 !"
Hans has to go. Bought VZ in May 2019 and he's returned a whopping 2.99%

"Just another hack dividend stock, does nothing for three years. What a pointless investment."
"Verizon dividends are late for at least some shareholders today. Anyone else experience this?According to my brokerage, they were due to be paid yesterday, but the brokerage had not yet received them. But the fault may not be with Verizon, given there are two entities between the corporation and brokerages: the paying agent and the clearing house."
"Time to buy, not to sell and feed the big fish."
"You don't buy VZ for appreciation. You buy it for the dividend. For appreciation, look elsewhere. As to its current low price, remember we are almost exactly half way between dividends, which is when VZ is always at its lowest. As it approaches the next x-dividend date it will move back above 56. Nothing dramatic, of course, but a couple of percent higher than it is now."
Normal dip between dividends. Will be making its way back above 56 as next x-dividend date approaches. This is a nice boring stock for those that want a safe dividend. Nothing really to see here. Just hold it and collect the dividend. End of story.
Hans pay went up from $18 million in 2020 to $19 million this year. What did he do except lose money for the shareholders?

Why would anyone buy VZ other then the dividend? Flat line growth just park your money and wait for dividend huh

"I have traded in and out of VX for the past couple of years. As a fairly cautious swing trader, I keep a list of quality stocks that I have tracked for years and wait until they get down into what I consider the safe zone before I consider buying. For VZ, that has meant dropping under $56, and better yet under $55.VZ has strong, consistent earnings and a great dividend, but is periodically overshadowed by the competition with T and TMUS and the amount of debt needed to keep growing out the 5G network.As with all stocks, when the price to real long term value gets beaten down we can start reaching silly low prices relative to history and the trend over the years. Take a look at the 5-year chart. As you can see, while there is room to go lower, in the current environment, I see the risk as about 1-down to 5-up. With the next dividend payout in 5 weeks, I can take that risk and see now as a good time to start accumulating VZ for the next run up towards the ex-dividend around October 8.Hope this makes sense and is of value."

"Revenue was $33.8 billion last quarter, up 11% year over year and about $1 billion ahead of consensus."
"Somethings wrong here, this is more than interest rates. Is there a problem with spin off of Yahoo?"
"American multinational telecommunications giant Verizon has been pushing Critical Race Theory (CRT) on its employees by teaching the United States is a deeply racist nation fueled by the equally racist economic system of capitalism, according to a report in City Journal."
This is when you buy more Verizon. Guaranteed to go up. Always buy more at 55.
vz will not go up till next dividend date.
Will never invest in VZ again now that they are Social Justice Warriors
"Insiders have sold 443,324 shares in the last 12 months. They have not bought even one share. In addition to all the free or cheap shares, the top 5 execs make between 2-5.8 million a year just in salary (excluding benefits) and the stock is lower than it was on November 1 2018 ( 60.3). Considering the 8% inflation since 2018, investors have lost 15% of their investment (minus dividends). The Dow is up 28% since November 1, 2018."
"If Apple adds satellite communications to next IPhone, Why would one need VZ or T anymore?"
T following VZ down. Is this all about the debt because business is good. Still want to buy 1k shares but don't want to catch a falling knife!
Everyday market goes up I feel more nervous about most of my holdings except VZ.
"VZ is a buy now when people are running to safety, better than GOLD!"
"For Verizon to get above $60+, the general market conditions need to deteriorate first since this dog tends to move inverse to risk assets. As market fear grows, buyers for the dividend step in."
"VZ should be up at least 3-6%, according to this earnings report..."
You can buy CVX with a Forward Dividend & Yield $5.36 (5.68%) BUT are you ready for a PE Ratio (TTM) $50.05? Nothing is cheap!
$VZ $QS $WIMI Low risk High reward=waiting for the real darkpool price to show up and we rich
"Wife and I have Verizon since Noah landed the Ark. He also had Verizon, just a different phone! First thing people do when their eyes open in the morning, grab the phone on the night table. The stock is like a utility and a railroad. What is a few cents either way in stock price. Note: 1y Target Est 60.51"
Do dividends offset the years decline in sp?Future?
Just added a few shares
VZ and T both should be climbing here. Pay great dividend both of them. Whole system broken here. WE are so over priced period.
