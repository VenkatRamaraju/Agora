Have been holding this stock for years while showing very little gain. Anyone on this board have any other stocks they could recommend? Thanks and GLTA
Verizon has a golden opportunity for a commercial.A TMUS customer opens a letter from TMUS that notifies him/her or the data breach exposing his phone to being hijacked.The customer looks terrified and then the kicker. When Cheap goes Wrong! Verizon a company you can trust.
Debt is fine when you use it to buy assets. Assets that hold value and deliver cash flow. Enterprise Value!
VZ CEO Hans presented a positive outlook & high momentum for the second half. JD Power and RootMetrics named VZ the best network. The biggest upgrade to 5G is in full swing. Won a DoD defense contract. Innovating the first 4G connected drone in the U.S. market. Expands Innovative Learning platform to schools.
What can make VZ go up?
"VZ is a proxy for cash, unlikely to go anywhere for another 6 months. Long term play on 5G. Try covered calls to boost short term yields"
Bought two truck loads right at closing today.
Thoughts at getting in at current price?
"Nothing makes this stock go up. Market up 275pts, Verizon flat."
55-56 price range....4.5% dividend.......better than a CD...so what's the problem??
"Verizon – Goldman Sachs upgraded Verizon to “buy” from “neutral,” noting underperformance due to a number of different concerns but ultimately concluding that key success factors for Verizon remain unchanged."
The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy
Looks like new 52 week low coming. I’ll be adding. This is where I’m going to park a decent chunk of cash for when market pullback happens.
"The move back up will continue as we approach the x-dividend date. Nothing new or unexpected. Same old stock pattern repeating itself. Just buy, hold and watch it go up."
This stock never goes up but it also doesn't crash. Best place to put money for 4.5% divs while the markets are crashing
"It's unfortunate that your opinion of customer service is less then perfect. My darling wife is on the phone with VZ customer service sometimes for an hour of more and they are patient, friendly, and determined to solve an issue. The stock is safer then and pays more then our US T bills."
"Inflation is coming and that's a bad thing. VZ has seen headcount go from 240k in 2006 to 132k last year. Because salary expense is going to go up per capita, the improvements VZ has made in revenue per employee from wireless growth will cushion the blow. Thank you Fairpoint and FTR old shareholders wherever you are. Stay the course, lash yourself to the deck and ride this double-hull tanker thru the storm."
Pretty amazing that VZ market cap is the same as it was a year ago. Is there no growth left? Buy for the yield with a payout ratio at 50%. Better than money market
"Sold this yesterday for a small profit. I do believe in Verizon stock long term, but in the short term there was a better opportunity for this money. I will re-enter VZ at the right price. The price has been consistent yet stagnant in this crazy market so this has felt like a higher-yield savings account. Long-term winner as they continue to pay down their large debt amount."
I'm sure buffett will be buying many more.
The amount of Debt put on the Balance Sheet in the last 18 months.... sadly this stock is going no where but down. The stock is trending down at a rate higher than the dividend. Sure we get a 4.5% div... but the stock looses 7%.... definitely not getting ahead.... I've held my shares 10yrs... should have just been in the QQQ.
"VZ performance has lagged the past few years, no doubt about it. Forward divy will likely rise > 4.6% next Q (assuming a qtrly DIV bump up to .64). One recent positive is that Verizon's share price seems to go up during very negative Market sessions, as traders flock to the safety and value of VZ.Its a stock you have to stash, not watch. And it should outperform if/when the markets finally correct."
VZ stock has a mean target price of 61.64. This means analysts expect the stock to rise 11.5% over the next 12 months.
Verizon recalling retirees due to Amazon & Google hiring away employees.
Good safe stock at a good safe price. I’m parking some cash here now that market is super bubbly. Low risk low reward. But 4.5 percent ain’t bad.

Does this thing EVER do anything else besides go down on a daily basis?
Enough already!!! Time to reverse.
"Time to buy, not to sell and feed the big fish."
Where is the bottom? When will it go back to $56?
"For those of you complaining and |3i+ching about the current price of the stock, keep this in mind: Over 75% (yes, that is correct) of the stock is owned by INSTITUTIONS. That doesn't even count some of the larger individual shareholders who also own this stock. Bottom line ... I'm willing to bet 90%+ of this stock is in strong, stable hands and isn't going anywhere. So what you're seeing traded is the 10% (400 million shares = 10%) that's out there being actively traded. So it's not going to move much. And if it really starts to drop, you'll see some of the 90%+ crowd step in and add to their positions. That is what is going on here. You're welcome."
"sup folks! im jumping on board this delicious beauty 1st thing this morning, it looks like nothing to gain dont it, but uhhh, i beg to differ, in fact, i predict VZ begins a multi-pulsr cycle within 2-3 weeks MAX thatll add a bundle of joy to this sleeping dragon...till then, do enjoy and party forth!!!"
biggest mistake of my life buying this dog
Steve Weiss picked VZ on halftime show today on cnbc
is it ever going to go up over 56.00
Will never invest in VZ again now that they are Social Justice Warriors
"Wife and I have Verizon since Noah landed the Ark. He also had Verizon, just a different phone! First thing people do when their eyes open in the morning, grab the phone on the night table. The stock is like a utility and a railroad. What is a few cents either way in stock price. Note: 1y Target Est 60.51"
"VZ common stock has been a pretty reliable 20 year bond. The price now is where it was in 2000 and has paid a reliable dividend, currently over 4%.I will be very happy if VZ can maintain its current stock price for another 20 years while paying a nice dividend( aka interest payment)"
Why is this always dead in the water?
9% over two years in just dividends. recession proof stock with plenty of upside. one of the best deals out there if you want a stable rock in this sea of an overvalued market.
"You don't buy VZ for appreciation. You buy it for the dividend. For appreciation, look elsewhere. As to its current low price, remember we are almost exactly half way between dividends, which is when VZ is always at its lowest. As it approaches the next x-dividend date it will move back above 56. Nothing dramatic, of course, but a couple of percent higher than it is now."
Just keep buying this under 55. This is a 5 percent Cd and will be fine if/when market pulls back
"American households are continuing to convert to streaming, so people have had to upgrade their download speeds and buy new routers. That money will fall directly to VZ's bottom line. 58-60 is coming."
Do dividends offset the years decline in sp?Future?
"2% from 52 week lows, reverse from here?"
"Somethings wrong here, this is more than interest rates. Is there a problem with spin off of Yahoo?"
The stock doesn't move and the divy can't keep up with inflation
"I have traded in and out of VX for the past couple of years. As a fairly cautious swing trader, I keep a list of quality stocks that I have tracked for years and wait until they get down into what I consider the safe zone before I consider buying. For VZ, that has meant dropping under $56, and better yet under $55.VZ has strong, consistent earnings and a great dividend, but is periodically overshadowed by the competition with T and TMUS and the amount of debt needed to keep growing out the 5G network.As with all stocks, when the price to real long term value gets beaten down we can start reaching silly low prices relative to history and the trend over the years. Take a look at the 5-year chart. As you can see, while there is room to go lower, in the current environment, I see the risk as about 1-down to 5-up. With the next dividend payout in 5 weeks, I can take that risk and see now as a good time to start accumulating VZ for the next run up towards the ex-dividend around October 8.Hope this makes sense and is of value."
"VZ like a savings bond, buy and hold and recieve 4.5% dividend every quarter, no big swings, no surprises, steady income...$55-56 perfect entry point, small risk."
I added 500 shares of VZ to my portfolio today.
"The issue is debt, debt, debt!!"
Was thinking about buying in the last few days but there appears to be no Botton here. Monitoring.
Everyday market goes up I feel more nervous about most of my holdings except VZ.
"Pretty high volume today, big guys are grabbing some cheap shares..."
This will be back to 56+ in 1-2 weeks. Really good opportunity to lock in low price and high yield.
Dividend watch: Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is forecast to boost its quarterly dividend payout to $0.64 per share from a prior level of $0.6275. The new yield of around 4.68% would be above the five-year average VZ yield of 4.47%.
VZ your in it for that Dividend look at the swings in the chart plenty of opportunities to get in and add on to your paycheck every quarter let’s face it we’re Lucky to have one of these in are portfolio you definitely know there not going anywhere keep buying those dips and enjoy your paychecks
"VZ is dropping much less than T & TMUS, hope it can go up tomorrow."
Does this ever move?
Just bought 600 shares was it a mistake we will soon see
