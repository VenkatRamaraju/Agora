"2nd rate store at best. Been in 3 of them, no reason to ever go back. Bass Pro, Scheel's and Cabelas are way better stores."
Should I stay or should I go

Today I sold my DKS at 131. I got in at 50! My best score in a long time. Thank you DKS.
How can Credit Suisse have a price target of 123 when the stock sits at 129. Most other upgrades are 150 to 175. Doesn't say much for Credit Suisse.
DKS is down -5.22% to 30.50
"just opened huge store. Great time to buy in this dip., "
"Also very pump and dump , down for the count @ -21% / should have shorted it"
Companies See Negative Responses to Cutting Business Ties With NRAPoll shows unfavorable ratings rose for firms that severed ties with the NRA-See Morning Consult Survey
Despite what what they say most of the posters are shorts.
Earnings 0730 ET Wednesday
"DKS has been cut off by many of the gun mfgs. It has been boycotted by an ever growing number of Patriotic Americans who believe in the Constitution. Look at the NFL, down year over year. People who were purchasing guns and gun supplies at DKS were also purchasing from their entire line. The long term outlook for growth among existing units is negative. You add Amazon into the picture and your investment is skating on thin ICE."
The role of a corporate CEO is to maximize profits and stock price not implement social change that at least half of his clientele (more at F&S) disagree with. Smart money is outta here.
"it's the next gander mtn, out of business soon...."
OK I just joined the NRA
Thank You for the great dividends
Just SSSHHHHORTED AT $144.09
"Here's the trick hold the stock after a big pop up.. Add options strike at every dollars to attrack as many puts buyers as you can. Those feed MMs and makes it easy for them to hold the stock and push it even higher... those were added at every dollar up to $145, that exactly the strike I've written...Be sure cboe is going to add strike at every dollar above $145(instead of $5), naturally its going to help MMs to pop AND hold the stock higher... MMs are now in a squeeze mode as the short position is high on this stock, some buyback but new shorts are adding.... Could easily hit $150+ ,(as long as the market doesn't pull back)... waiting another +$5,$10 fast before thinkng of going short, probably writing call spread..."
Why does this keep going up?
"Not a great trade stock with the low volune but a good long play. Also kind of singled out in its sector, many other similar retail stores are privately owned(Cabela, Bass Pro, REI). Also, very small debt…"
Never owned this stock but the special dividend Is very enticing! Should you buy just for dividend?
Thanks to all you longs for your financing my call girls and blow regiment 
Over bought
DKS will implode just like KSS and NIKE.
"buy low, or lower. Sell high. This sell off is about over regardless of dividends, they are baked in. .... last chance to get in below $136"
Over 17% of the float is shorts in DKS. This should be a fun day
$140 here we come !
Shorted this 10 times today for + $2300.
"Anyone remember the days when this was a sporting goods stock, trading in the 60's (dec 2016), and not in the social justice business? This stock has lost 1/2 it's value in 30 months in one of the greatest bull market runs ever. Wonder how it will do when we have a real bear market. JS."
Current PE ratio is 8.9. There are articles being published using the old PE ratio of 19 before earnings. Yahoo needs to be quicker with updating financial ratios after earnings.
Short squeeze taking place with DKS?
Anyone short will have to pay the dividend.
Hey Jeff...hows that again about telling the NRA they're wrong......ba ha ha ha ha
"The urban stores will endure the loss of the hunt line. However the rural locations and the stores in small cities will have a difficult time. Country folk don't buy fan gear like city people, instead they buy things that contribute to their existence. The things that help feed you and keep you warm are the priority not the Labron James jersey. It's not just guns, it's the whole hunt line including camo, deer lure, ammo, tree stands, safes, bows, arrows, duck calls, decoys, scopes and mounts, binoculars, gun slings, solvents and cleaning kits... The list could go on. Look at where the stores are located then eliminate any that are outside the fan gear markets. I was a customer when their were only 2 stores, it will be sad to see them go."
DKS behaved almost exactly as it did Friday except for the weakness in the afternoon before the close . My feeling was it would top out ( for now ) at 140 something which it did . I’ll be watching this tomorrow but I expect it to sell off a bit - normal profit taking plus some vulture short sellers ( sorry short sellers I’m just not a big fan of the process ).
what's this about fraud I have a feeling something bad is about to come out
"Maybe not very soon, but this, along with may other stocks will plunge, like a peregrine falcon. NO DOUBT. I am trying to earn more money outside the markets, so I can add to my shorts."
Hope you followed my advises for months on DKS. Investing is a real job and that’s my job. Patience and quality always pay off.
"E. Stack wanted to be a hero to the liberal press. He made appearances on many talk shows displaying his moral superiority.The media loved him for his bravery. Unfortunately, many of his customers did not like his political grandstanding and shopped elsewhere."
"The management of this company leaves me shaking my head. Headlines like this one will keep popping up as long as the company continues to disrespect firearms owners in America, whether that's those interested in self defense, general marksmanship, or hunting.https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/01/28/lawsuit-against-dicks-sporting-goods-over.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
"Best in class retailer, evolved leadership (position on guns, human resources and pricing) and potential acquisition target.... I've never seen DKS management team let a controllable variable go sideways. Full disclosure - There is none longer than me on this equity bought it at the IPO strike price. 4600% increase later I'm expecting DKS to continue to serve the share holders and I will continue to critically own this stock."

Too bad they got political.
Glad this fell today. I don’t have skin in the game here. I told myself I would never buy stock of this company after they entered the political scheme and took a hard left turn about a year ago.
Shareholders paying the price for liberal CEOs political views ?
take profits this wont last.....
You just have to hold until open tomorrow to get $5.93 div. As I understand it'll drop $5.93 at least and I fear big profit taking after open given big run since earnings
"Jackson Hole event tomorrow, be careful guys"
Remember buying this at $135 longs? Hahahahahahaha!
Man. It’s the name of the store. You’re not supposed to take one 
"I'd sell while you still have $135 on this. Be grateful, not greedy, for the kind of gains this has handed you this week. I'm not so sure that tomorrow, Fed speak & Friday, is going to continue the upward price movement you're hoping for. $125 was reasonable, $135 was a gift."
What time is earnings tomorrow so I can sell close my call after spike
Allllllllllllll aboard!
"Dropped -12.6%, WOW !"
"My concern is this has surged on earnings but no Sellers yet, holding for div. But on Thurs I wonder if this sells off hard. Only have to hold until after it opens Thurs then you sell and still get the 5.93 div. Shares will drop the amount of div at open and it seems like a lot of profit selling that day."
Hobby and recreational products are not so important if you don’t have a job. This sector of retail could be down for quite some time.
shorted a thousand shares at 54.18 this is one short I'm not worried about
Wow stores loaded with people . Heard no discounts inventory low which means more money
$34 fosho 
So much for all the Debbie downers bad mouthing the company when they got rid of the firearms …
"I don't know why there are those that want to short a company doing as well as DKS. Is it because you are short it now and wanting to talk it down and add to your position, so you don't get killed as badly? It really makes no sense. Take your losses and find a better (worse) company to short. It is true that there is a disparity in Retail right now where some have figured it out and others have not. DKS is killing it. The short squeeze is on right now! DKS management understands shareholder value better than most companies. If you short a company that just absolutely smashed earnings, raised their regular dividend and announced a special dividend of $5.50 per share, doubled their stock buyback program and raised their forecast for the rest of the year (BTW, they will beat that too and raise again next quarter!), then you really don't know what you are doing and must like losing money. Seriously."
"Today looks like a blow-off top from the euphoria of a dividend increase, not thinking about the fact that stores are being closed nationwide due to DKS hatred of its own largest customer base—firearms owners. Here comes the reckoning."
"Was Friday a bull trap? Stocks sure did rally despite world troubles (Afghanistan). Market may have a delayed reaction to it tomorrow. Add to it the situation unfolding in the gulf from Ida (gas supply and price concerns going forward), could have a bit of a bloody Monday to correct last week's upward movements. Might see a decent correction on this stock and others that rallied last week. DKS to $130? I would secure profits in premarket before that happens!"
The store's name says it all.
"This is outstanding! If you’ve been on this a while, check out ASO. academy sports has ER June 8. Very similar story and still has a high short float too."
Is this safe to hold 130 til fri?
$33 this week 
Fraudulent companies don't pay out special dividends at $5.50.... actually this company seems shareholder friendly... glad they didn't sell guns low profit a lot of paper work and liabilities.... 
"This stock is overvalued at 110. However, the company is doing well to increase to this level; buyback or dividend."
I think my favorite thing about Yahoo boards is reading pessimistic shorts crying about successful businesses.

"Destroying merchandise to make a political statement....? Time to short, this is the next Gander Mountain."
Nice move up today !
Never shopping here again
"Hunters will boycott the stores even more now, leaving a bunch of overpriced sports team stuff that fewer and fewer people are buying. The rest can be bought online or at Walmart. Cabellas/Bass Pro will eat their lunch in the outdoor/hunting space which accounted for about 1/4 of the floor space last store I was in (which was about a year ago). The store was nearly empty on a Sat afternoon."
"Some of you folks here are super hung up on DKS being a retailer . I mean why should a retailer get any love these days ?Well DKS has adapted to the changing market and is thriving - it’s got great cash flow , a splendid growth rate and manageable debt at around 19% . I agree - retailing is a scary business but SOME folks do it well in their niche ( WMT & M to name a couple ). Will DKS be thriving in 10 years ? I dunno . I’d probably be more likely to bet on WalMart that far out , but for now they’ve got it going on !"

Another company that did not understand who their customer base is. Starbucks or gone bucks is another
Not only would I not buy this stock I would not set foot in there stores !!!
Where the bottom hmmmm
17% of the float shorted - that was covering today - not sure why the media can’t call out a play
BTW the $5 dollar special dividend comes off the stock price the day of payout. So if it closes the prior day 131 it opens at 125 and those who didn't time it right and did not get the dividend get screwed $5 off their stock.
$$140. at close... somehow this economy is looking good.... 
"Amazing report, just incredible....Adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.01 in the latest quarter, crushing the FactSet-survey-derived analyst consensus of $1.08.Sales soared 23% to $2.41 billion from $1.96 billion. The latest figure beat the FactSet analyst consensus of $2.24 billion.Same-store sales jumped 23.2% in the latest quarter, besting the analyst consensus of 13%. Digital sales skyrocketed 95%, constituting 21% of total sales."
"DKS dividened reinstated, business is clearly booming...also keep an eye on BGFV (Big 5 Sporting Goods)...small cap sporting goods store on west coast, mkt cap only $45M, $1B in sales...big secular tailwind in sporting goods, and they also sell firearms and ammunition. One to watch."
"Good to see so many new shorts on board. Today's bloodbath is just the beginning of DKS's decline and ultimate fall. I've made a lot of money shorting DKS since they came out swinging against their own customers, but today was epic. Way better than any long positions!"
a terrible store compared to Academy I'm surprised they're still in business

down but on low volume. cp up on big volume.

"Getting expelled from the NSSF which is the largest outdoor trade group is not a good sign... Having several of your larger vendors drop you is also not good..

Shorted yesterday. Got out this morning. Git 'er done!!!!
Shorts have to cover by Wednesday 9/8/ that's when you will see 150.
"Now would be a good time for the co. to start buying shares, they could save on the dividend."
can't wait to buy at $60
Regret DKS became overtly political. Forced me to stop buying there once they took a position hostile to my views. I had bought ammo there regularly. No more. Same store sales are down. Maybe having an effect. Principles matter and have consequences.
They won’t have merchandises to sell .Lock down plus power crunch and chain supplies snafu.
Sinking like a rock damn down 15 point by Tommorrow end day trading never expected sell off before ex dividend
DKS is down -4.92% to 33.82
I'll find somewhere else to shop thank you! Stay away from Political compares. The majority of people in the USA support the 2nd
"DKS is history. Pandering to the left who are the minority and not the majority when it comes to law abiding citizens. Obviously the majority of us law abiding citizens, otherwise who is paying the income taxes for the roads and funding the bloated guvt'? The genius' on the left are rapidly destroying our country."
"Gotta say I'm surprised to see there was more upside to DKS today. Congrats to those who have squeezed even more out of this stock this past week. Still think it's greedy to keep expecting more and not take profits but hey - so far it's been working. One day it'll have a really good pullback. Monday? The following week? Who knows. Anyways, considering much of the market went on a pretty good bullish run today, through to close, I'm not so sure it's anything particularly special about DKS's extended upside direction. It seems it was just alot of bullish type buying in general. As for the special dividend coming, it may not work out as well as you might think. Check out RKT after they attempted to push out the short positions by special dividend. Didn't phase things one bit. In fact the share price ended up dropping pretty bad despite a raging+ home/mortgage situation we've had this year. DKS is now in the analyst new ranges and one bad market day + profit-taking could send this back 5-10% fairly easy."
Bass Pro Shop is so much better than this place. They better not try to write off all that inventory they are willingly destroying.
Shorting this to the low $120’s. You’ve been warned.
Am I reading this correctly? Instead of an expected loss of .09 a share they reported a 1.71 loss per share?
Buffett warned CEOs to leave their liberal politics to home-now the CONSEQUENCES !
Where’s Jesse ? I’ll take all the $135 bags you’ve got lol
I sold at $131
Cashed out $137 calls . Nothing wrong with taking some profits . My opinion on DKS has not changed .
they will show in your position acct and that's where you can sell them from
Not much to complain about with the special whopping dividend payout today!!
Again and again dks has proven to be a reliable stock
wait until their next 10-Q when all the gun sales are not showing up on the sheet... this stock will be 15 before year end...
covering some shares shorted many points higher.... and writing some puts différents strike to partly hedge my profit...

"Longs, be VERY careful here, $132 and cboe halted options trading o the stock..... It has something really bad going on..."
I should have sold my weekly puts on GME rather than this but I did not due to the earning call on GME yesterday. Who would have thought a stock with a PE ratio of 11 would go down like this in a couple of days. Now I have to sell covered calls until I recover.
I’m new and entered at 116. Is it fine to keep it long ?
The Shorts are getting killed and anyone still short DKS is responsible for the Dividends and cash will be taken out of their accounts to cover the dividend for the legal owner. It will be interesting to see what transpires leading up to the special dividend being paid out. I think this stock is headed higher. Leadership at DKS understands shareholder value.

Poor company to invest in. Poor customer service and anti-gun. I'll use anyone but what the name implies
There’s too much expectation any blip will crush this baby . I have a short position at 135.2
I remember the original #$%$ store that my dad would always shop in. What a weird path this company has taken from small to large.Eventually it will be no more.Remember the focus for all businesses - customers.
"After their anti-gun policies, I have bought nothing from them. I know many others who feel the same. All of our kids sport clothes and gear is now purchased elsewhere..."
I have two stores within 15 minutes of me and they are both always empty how can they maintain the high rent in the Mall of Georgia with five people in the store
This is really overpriced for what it is but okay lol
"Is DKS even going to be profitable in 2023? :) I have never seen a sporting goods chain or electronics store not go out of business let along one that has to compete with Amazon. History always repeats itself so for new buyers on all this volume today, be very careful.Great quarter for DKS but very leary of this price point. This is the accountant in me speaking."
"Another price upgrade, this time by Morgan Stanley, let’s go!! 135 today!"
Bought at $57 and I think it’s time to take some off the top
The way I see it a couple of our holders got together and each sold a few million shares but not before buying 1000's of buts. That is why our exec sold shares before the dividend. mho
"After 2000 Dow cut today, let's see if a bit rebound tomorrow, what if DKS delivers good results with rebounding Dow ?"

"Bought DKS at the strike prices almost 20 years ago.... Split adjusted $3. per share. It's been, and will continue to be a wonderful ride. One of the more knowledgeable cadre's of retail leadership in the business. Keep it up and Thank you, Investor"

$140... tomorrow
I sold half my shares in the 70's 
Over extended.....consolidation imminent.
"All this is going to do is make most hunters fisherman and outdoorsman in general who are pro 2A look else where for their supplies. Liberals may be happy but I doubt they will be flocking in to buy golf clubs and footballs just because the store wont be selling ""assault rifles""."
Out of my position for now I will get back in one week or so .
"Nike cuts forecast will impact DKS , there’s too much expectation here any snafu we could see 20% hair cut . IMO"
Run away!
Hard to believe they're even still around with their high prices.
As an investor not in this lifetime will I buy this stock nor a fund that invests in this stock. Additionally no one in my family will ever step in a store. This company is anti constitution therefore anti America. Love this country? Then don't shop there.
"I still buy Under Armor, I still buy guns. But after they politicized themselves over gun control, I buy nothing from them. This company will he gone, sold, or greatly reduced in size before long."
Sorry I am a new buyer of DKS. Not sure how this special dividend affects's today's price and see no news on it. I am losing big as I bought past week. Should I sell as this price drop is extreme unless a good reason for it like a special dividend. Thank you for any advise.
My thoughts should hit 150 Tommorrow or Wednesday . Brisk sales and ex dividend Thursday
Was the recent special dividend previously announced?
Anyone short? Thinking of putting on a short position or buying some puts. They've worked hard to alienate their base. Thoughts?
Gotta say I was ready at 9:30 AM to go all in . I hesitated when I saw it go up then down then up then way down then back up then way up then way down . I can’t reliably do short term trades with that kind of volatility as I’d end up buying too high . But I’m seriously bullish on DKS and will be taking a position next week .
If had money buy it today end of the day and ride it back to 145
No gun sales... Now no Hunting gear. My favorite store gone to the Snow Flakes!! I have a credit card from them. Not any longer. I am out. Not shopping there again. I wil go to Cabelas or Bass Pro.... I also will tell a lot of friend about it!! they are going to loose a lot of business. hence the stock down 5% today!!
were they considered essential? How come DKS couldnt catch a bid before epidemic and now with their stores mostly shutdown trhey become a powerhouse
yeah baby
It’s way overbought. I will short this baby today .
Great quarter again for retail!!!!! Now i persoanlly think DKS is worth $75 per share. Stimulus will run out eventually and be spent on the new increase in real estate property of the consummers.
Thinking of a run to 35
"If the management is fraud, what can we do? they pumped the price by a special div, then dumped."
"After hours running well, I think we will see +10% tomorrow"
Now that CBOE Halted ALL options trading... U better expect a Big rop soon....
Time to short this POS
People should pick this stock its gonna rise because of sport season.
The shorts turned Tuesday into Thursday.
So I guess the selloff will continue till tomorrow? XD day?

"I wouldn't be surprised to see a nice gap down coming in the coming days.... well, not that I need it.... but usually, cboe do NOT halt stock options trading like this....."
we not sure of what we have no proof of. but if people short or sell that's legal and part of the game If the suits secretly bought thousands of shares and we benefited we wouldn't complain. Bottom line this stock will be huge in the next few weeks. I've seen this same sell off many times with huge companies and they all came back and surpassed the losses. really no worries. 
"Used to shop here all the time and get tons of coupons, never buying from them again!"
"@OptionTrader8- so, did you find anything out? You said you were going to talk to the CBOE? I don't trade options and curious about your claim that there will be lawsuits. Lawsuits against who? I'll tell you this. Short interest was just reported for period ending 8/31 on Dick's. Blew me away that short interest actually went up 5 days after earnings. While a temporary pull back is expected after such a strong run, if the shorts don't get out, they are going to get killed again. The average EPS for this current quarter is $1.81. Dick's will blow that away again and raise their forecast again just like they keep doing. This company is too well run and making too much money to short it. Maybe short it next year when it gets over $175 and they are up against tough comps."
this premarket$6.00 drop is because of ex dividend date today.
Why are people shorting this stock?
"nice short squeeze today, still losing my a---- on this thing"
"Insiders selling, read the filings"
"Wow I said 10% was my expectation yesterday, it did that before the opening. Those were fantastic earnings!! Let’s see 20%+ today"
Almost no upside resistance now . Short sellers are closing positions in an orderly fashion - for now .
Be sure.... lawsuits are already on the go........
I once was a frequent customer but after the CEO turned political I have not returned.
I’m going to buy some put options before the market closes. I know there’s a lot of articles being optimistic but I feel like specialty stores like DKS will suffer from coronavirus. Hoping the price keeps going up so put options are cheaper. Feed back anyone
"Can someone please explain why this stock has gone up since earnings were announced yesterday? Not that I’m complaining as I own few shares, but I just don’t see it."
"Shattered all records, buy the dip if you can. Great company sharing the profits with a dividend increase. "
Love how a boycott proves the power is in the peoples hands and not their political stance.
Dks is a strong company that will no doubt double its market cap in the next year
Short squeeze it could run multiple days with 15 % float shorted.
"Let me see, these guys are destroying perfectly good inventory to make a political statement which will drive away MORE of their customers. Yup, seems like a great business plan."

Going to short the stock big time tomorrow morning.
"Good Q10 28 cents .15 divident BGFV over 8% divident In November 1997, Miller led a management effort to control the destiny of the company, raising $250 million to acquire a controlling interest in Big 5 from Leonard Green. As a result, Leonard Green's ownership position fell from 67 percent to 36.2 percent. 2001 Big 5 with a market capitalization of little more than $280 millionIn 2001, Big 5 entered a new market, Colorado, opening two stores. For the year, sales grew to nearly $622.5 million, with net income totaled almost $15 million. Management also made plans to take the company public, in the summer of 2001 filing for an initial public offering (IPO), hoping to raise as much as $115 million despite a difficult market for IPO's in recent months. Not only would Big 5 be able to relieve its debt burden, freeing up cash flow dedicated to servicing its debt and making the company less vulnerable to downturns in the economy, Leonard Green and its affiliate, Green Equity Investors, was looking to reduce its ownership position and further profit from its investment in the sporting goods chain. Big 5 enlisted Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. to underwrite the stock sale in association with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., Jefferies & Co., and Stephens Inc. With the stock market adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the offering was postponed. It was finally held in June 2002 but proved somewhat disappointing. The company had established an expected price range of $14 to $16 per share but in the end had to settle for $13, resulting in $104.65 million raised. Moreover, when the stock began trading on the NASDAQ, the price showed almost no movement on the first day. It reached a high of $13.84 before closing at $13.17, leaving Big 5 with a market capitalization of little more than $280 million What's Big Five worth today? With sales are now over a billion dollars a year"
The shorts will never be in control of this stock for long!!!
Sell before too late
Yes it’s down today - perhaps in sympathy with a big Dow drop we’ll over 200 points - but it DID hit a new all time high today at one point despite the tepid close .
"As predicted, weekly option strikes were added at every $1, up to $150.."
$3 stock
"Cracked $32 resistance. Time for a run to all time highs next week. Fair value $40 when compared to $DKS and $HIBB.Huge re-opening trade. Lots of sporting equipment will be needed, not only retail but for schools and businesses. Still waaaaaaay too many shorts in this and heavily underwater. Let me know when they cover."
150 could be today.
"Options NO more trading by now on DSK.... this ain't good..... I,m short on call 140 and 145 but just added some short on the stock to $132+...."
"Interesting spot, going to pick some up. Great company, fantastic earnings, price targets of $145+"
This price level will be history ?
