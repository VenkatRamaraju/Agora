I’m new and entered at 116. Is it fine to keep it long ?
Thinking of a run to 35
Over 17% of the float is shorts in DKS. This should be a fun day
Over bought
It’s way overbought. I will short this baby today .
"Some of you folks here are super hung up on DKS being a retailer . I mean why should a retailer get any love these days ?Well DKS has adapted to the changing market and is thriving - it’s got great cash flow , a splendid growth rate and manageable debt at around 19% . I agree - retailing is a scary business but SOME folks do it well in their niche ( WMT & M to name a couple ). Will DKS be thriving in 10 years ? I dunno . I’d probably be more likely to bet on WalMart that far out , but for now they’ve got it going on !"
"After hours running well, I think we will see +10% tomorrow"
"Shorts have been feeding shares to buyers all morning, especially in high 120's."
"Is DKS even going to be profitable in 2023? :) I have never seen a sporting goods chain or electronics store not go out of business let along one that has to compete with Amazon. History always repeats itself so for new buyers on all this volume today, be very careful.Great quarter for DKS but very leary of this price point. This is the accountant in me speaking."
"In other news, NVDA, a gigantic and significant player, is up only 200% since pre-pandemic high, and 320% since pandemic low. You do the math and deductive reasoning. PS. I just picked a random stock, without overthinking it."
"Gotta say I'm surprised to see there was more upside to DKS today. Congrats to those who have squeezed even more out of this stock this past week. Still think it's greedy to keep expecting more and not take profits but hey - so far it's been working. One day it'll have a really good pullback. Monday? The following week? Who knows. Anyways, considering much of the market went on a pretty good bullish run today, through to close, I'm not so sure it's anything particularly special about DKS's extended upside direction. It seems it was just alot of bullish type buying in general. As for the special dividend coming, it may not work out as well as you might think. Check out RKT after they attempted to push out the short positions by special dividend. Didn't phase things one bit. In fact the share price ended up dropping pretty bad despite a raging+ home/mortgage situation we've had this year. DKS is now in the analyst new ranges and one bad market day + profit-taking could send this back 5-10% fairly easy."
My ====D keeps going up!
"Get this: this stock is 115% higher than pre-pandemic high, and 850% higher than pandemic low....for a RETAILER. Does that make sense? Yes, I am shorting it."
What time is earnings tomorrow so I can sell close my call after spike
"This stock is overvalued at 110. However, the company is doing well to increase to this level; buyback or dividend."
Never owned this stock but the special dividend Is very enticing! Should you buy just for dividend?
Today I sold my DKS at 131. I got in at 50! My best score in a long time. Thank you DKS.
$135 bags for sale!
Special dividend of 5.50
Wow.!! Single trade of 800k shares at $135 at 2:30 today
"I'd sell while you still have $135 on this. Be grateful, not greedy, for the kind of gains this has handed you this week. I'm not so sure that tomorrow, Fed speak & Friday, is going to continue the upward price movement you're hoping for. $125 was reasonable, $135 was a gift."
"Another price upgrade, this time by Morgan Stanley, let’s go!! 135 today!"
"Maybe not very soon, but this, along with may other stocks will plunge, like a peregrine falcon. NO DOUBT. I am trying to earn more money outside the markets, so I can add to my shorts."
Bought at $57 and I think it’s time to take some off the top
How can Credit Suisse have a price target of 123 when the stock sits at 129. Most other upgrades are 150 to 175. Doesn't say much for Credit Suisse.
$DKS Target Raised by Cowen Outperform USD 147 » USD 150 Maintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 115 » USD 120 Maintains Telsey Advisory Group Outperform USD 113 » USD 125
This price level will be history ?
The Shorts are getting killed and anyone still short DKS is responsible for the Dividends and cash will be taken out of their accounts to cover the dividend for the legal owner. It will be interesting to see what transpires leading up to the special dividend being paid out. I think this stock is headed higher. Leadership at DKS understands shareholder value.
Great quarter again for retail!!!!! Now i persoanlly think DKS is worth $75 per share. Stimulus will run out eventually and be spent on the new increase in real estate property of the consummers.
Just SSSHHHHORTED AT $144.09
Cashed out $137 calls . Nothing wrong with taking some profits . My opinion on DKS has not changed .
Gotta say I was ready at 9:30 AM to go all in . I hesitated when I saw it go up then down then up then way down then back up then way up then way down . I can’t reliably do short term trades with that kind of volatility as I’d end up buying too high . But I’m seriously bullish on DKS and will be taking a position next week .
Should I stay or should I go
"Was Friday a bull trap? Stocks sure did rally despite world troubles (Afghanistan). Market may have a delayed reaction to it tomorrow. Add to it the situation unfolding in the gulf from Ida (gas supply and price concerns going forward), could have a bit of a bloody Monday to correct last week's upward movements. Might see a decent correction on this stock and others that rallied last week. DKS to $130? I would secure profits in premarket before that happens!"
"Best in class retailer, evolved leadership (position on guns, human resources and pricing) and potential acquisition target.... I've never seen DKS management team let a controllable variable go sideways. Full disclosure - There is none longer than me on this equity bought it at the IPO strike price. 4600% increase later I'm expecting DKS to continue to serve the share holders and I will continue to critically own this stock."
"Wow I said 10% was my expectation yesterday, it did that before the opening. Those were fantastic earnings!! Let’s see 20%+ today"
I sold half my shares in the 70's 
Out of my position for now I will get back in one week or so .
Stephens & Co. PRICE TARGET 129. Actual DKS stock price 135. What's wrong with this picture?
Where’s Jesse ? I’ll take all the $135 bags you’ve got lol
