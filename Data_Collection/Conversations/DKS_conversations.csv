Bought at $57 and I think it’s time to take some off the top
Warren Buffet warned business 3 days ago to keep your political views out of your business.
Should I stay or should I go
Academy will put them out of business.
Short squeeze taking place with DKS?
This price level will be history ?
"Let me see, these guys are destroying perfectly good inventory to make a political statement which will drive away MORE of their customers. Yup, seems like a great business plan."
"Good to see so many new shorts on board. Today's bloodbath is just the beginning of DKS's decline and ultimate fall. I've made a lot of money shorting DKS since they came out swinging against their own customers, but today was epic. Way better than any long positions!"
Why the low volume
DKS behaved almost exactly as it did Friday except for the weakness in the afternoon before the close . My feeling was it would top out ( for now ) at 140 something which it did . I’ll be watching this tomorrow but I expect it to sell off a bit - normal profit taking plus some vulture short sellers ( sorry short sellers I’m just not a big fan of the process ).
"I don't know why there are those that want to short a company doing as well as DKS. Is it because you are short it now and wanting to talk it down and add to your position, so you don't get killed as badly? It really makes no sense. Take your losses and find a better (worse) company to short. It is true that there is a disparity in Retail right now where some have figured it out and others have not. DKS is killing it. The short squeeze is on right now! DKS management understands shareholder value better than most companies. If you short a company that just absolutely smashed earnings, raised their regular dividend and announced a special dividend of $5.50 per share, doubled their stock buyback program and raised their forecast for the rest of the year (BTW, they will beat that too and raise again next quarter!), then you really don't know what you are doing and must like losing money. Seriously."
"Great earnings and great guide forward! I feel that this stock will continue to head higher. I think like 15-20% of the stock is short and they will feel more and more uncomfortable as it continues to rise. I feel that they will be continually covering some by their uneasiness and others by forced margin calls. If the WSB Reddit crowd gets involved, then the stock will soar even more."
After hours this will flourish to 138-140
Cashed out $137 calls . Nothing wrong with taking some profits . My opinion on DKS has not changed .
Not a good idea to invest in a company that has declared war on its own customers. SJWs now run the company and they have made it clear that they hate gun owners and are actively working to reduce the rights of those Americans.
CEO lives in a gated community with armed guards.
Today I sold my DKS at 131. I got in at 50! My best score in a long time. Thank you DKS.
"Good Q10 28 cents .15 divident BGFV over 8% divident In November 1997, Miller led a management effort to control the destiny of the company, raising $250 million to acquire a controlling interest in Big 5 from Leonard Green. As a result, Leonard Green's ownership position fell from 67 percent to 36.2 percent. 2001 Big 5 with a market capitalization of little more than $280 millionIn 2001, Big 5 entered a new market, Colorado, opening two stores. For the year, sales grew to nearly $622.5 million, with net income totaled almost $15 million. Management also made plans to take the company public, in the summer of 2001 filing for an initial public offering (IPO), hoping to raise as much as $115 million despite a difficult market for IPO's in recent months. Not only would Big 5 be able to relieve its debt burden, freeing up cash flow dedicated to servicing its debt and making the company less vulnerable to downturns in the economy, Leonard Green and its affiliate, Green Equity Investors, was looking to reduce its ownership position and further profit from its investment in the sporting goods chain. Big 5 enlisted Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. to underwrite the stock sale in association with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., Jefferies & Co., and Stephens Inc. With the stock market adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the offering was postponed. It was finally held in June 2002 but proved somewhat disappointing. The company had established an expected price range of $14 to $16 per share but in the end had to settle for $13, resulting in $104.65 million raised. Moreover, when the stock began trading on the NASDAQ, the price showed almost no movement on the first day. It reached a high of $13.84 before closing at $13.17, leaving Big 5 with a market capitalization of little more than $280 million What's Big Five worth today? With sales are now over a billion dollars a year"
"I'd sell while you still have $135 on this. Be grateful, not greedy, for the kind of gains this has handed you this week. I'm not so sure that tomorrow, Fed speak & Friday, is going to continue the upward price movement you're hoping for. $125 was reasonable, $135 was a gift."
"After their anti-gun policies, I have bought nothing from them. I know many others who feel the same. All of our kids sport clothes and gear is now purchased elsewhere..."
The role of a corporate CEO is to maximize profits and stock price not implement social change that at least half of his clientele (more at F&S) disagree with. Smart money is outta here.
"Those who approve of the company's decision should put out a lawn sign stating ""This is a gun free home"" . Let us know how that works out ."
Over extended.....consolidation imminent.
How does a moderate earnings beat justify a >25% boost?
dog with fleas
"I am downgrading it to SELL, don't see any reason it should be trading above $2"
Hope you followed my advises for months on DKS. Investing is a real job and that’s my job. Patience and quality always pay off.
This is in a slide.
"6-Analysts Rated This basically Neutral (Neutral =Sell), why's it going up? lol"
"Amazing report, just incredible....Adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.01 in the latest quarter, crushing the FactSet-survey-derived analyst consensus of $1.08.Sales soared 23% to $2.41 billion from $1.96 billion. The latest figure beat the FactSet analyst consensus of $2.24 billion.Same-store sales jumped 23.2% in the latest quarter, besting the analyst consensus of 13%. Digital sales skyrocketed 95%, constituting 21% of total sales."
Special dividend of 5.50
Earnings 0730 ET Wednesday
Dropping guns from 125 stores. Well drop one CEO and they would be better off.
DKS sell sell sell !
What time is earnings tomorrow so I can sell close my call after spike
"Getting expelled from the NSSF which is the largest outdoor trade group is not a good sign... Having several of your larger vendors drop you is also not good.. Local to me the (DKS) sporting goods is like a ghost town, academy is fairly busy.. But Academy is selling what the people want and at a lower price from what I could tell."
Gotta say I was ready at 9:30 AM to go all in . I hesitated when I saw it go up then down then up then way down then back up then way up then way down . I can’t reliably do short term trades with that kind of volatility as I’d end up buying too high . But I’m seriously bullish on DKS and will be taking a position next week .
will never shop here
Who and why are investors buying this with meager earnings and unremarkable outlook?
People went there to buy guns?
$135 for a retail chain. quite laughable. good luck. you'll need lots of it.

How can Credit Suisse have a price target of 123 when the stock sits at 129. Most other upgrades are 150 to 175. Doesn't say much for Credit Suisse.
I'll find somewhere else to shop thank you! Stay away from Political compares. The majority of people in the USA support the 2nd

"E. Stack wanted to be a hero to the liberal press. He made appearances on many talk shows displaying his moral superiority.The media loved him for his bravery. Unfortunately, many of his customers did not like his political grandstanding and shopped elsewhere."
Why does this keep going up?
Regret DKS became overtly political. Forced me to stop buying there once they took a position hostile to my views. I had bought ammo there regularly. No more. Same store sales are down. Maybe having an effect. Principles matter and have consequences.
were they considered essential? How come DKS couldnt catch a bid before epidemic and now with their stores mostly shutdown trhey become a powerhouse
I’m new and entered at 116. Is it fine to keep it long ?
My ====D keeps going up!
"Another price upgrade, this time by Morgan Stanley, let’s go!! 135 today!"
"I still buy Under Armor, I still buy guns. But after they politicized themselves over gun control, I buy nothing from them. This company will he gone, sold, or greatly reduced in size before long."
$3 stock
Time to short this POS
Short.
"Jackson Hole event tomorrow, be careful guys"
"Shattered all records, buy the dip if you can. Great company sharing the profits with a dividend increase. "
"Good news - - DKS is still selling guns and ammo at most of their stores. And, DKS trading ex-dividend today, but still up almost 1% as I post. I feel bad for the scared sellers who bailed 2 days ago."
wellcome to 100$ stock clubhouse
Not only would I not buy this stock I would not set foot in there stores !!!
This is really overpriced for what it is but okay lol
This pullback will not last long
wait until their next 10-Q when all the gun sales are not showing up on the sheet... this stock will be 15 before year end...
Sell before too late
"This is a dip, the earning report is higher than predicted, throughout the day it will explode"
"Maybe not very soon, but this, along with may other stocks will plunge, like a peregrine falcon. NO DOUBT. I am trying to earn more money outside the markets, so I can add to my shorts."
Is this safe to hold 130 til fri?
"Get out while you can, upset the hunting community watch the stock drop"
Bass Pro Shop is so much better than this place. They better not try to write off all that inventory they are willingly destroying.
ceo must go.
They are opening a new store in East Texas with NO GUNS or AMMO!!! Talk bout bad business decision. East Texas IS guns!!! If they think East Texans are going to buy $85.00 golf shirts they're out of their minds.
DKS ~ blow-out earnings with 20% of the float short. Look out above!
Got a job there yesterday. Go teammates!
Almost no upside resistance now . Short sellers are closing positions in an orderly fashion - for now .
shorted a thousand shares at 54.18 this is one short I'm not worried about
Current PE ratio is 8.9. There are articles being published using the old PE ratio of 19 before earnings. Yahoo needs to be quicker with updating financial ratios after earnings.
$135 bags for sale!
lol...over inflated company
"Used to shop here all the time and get tons of coupons, never buying from them again!"
Why are people shorting this stock?
"I’m sorry but the comments here are very confusing. People are talking about bankruptcy, high debt, losses, or even suggesting I read the balance sheet. The Company made $120 million in profits, has little or no debt, almost $2 billion in equity, what am I missing? What balance sheet are you looking at?"
"This stock is overvalued at 110. However, the company is doing well to increase to this level; buyback or dividend."
$DKS Target Raised by Cowen Outperform USD 147 » USD 150 Maintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 115 » USD 120 Maintains Telsey Advisory Group Outperform USD 113 » USD 125
"Get this: this stock is 115% higher than pre-pandemic high, and 850% higher than pandemic low....for a RETAILER. Does that make sense? Yes, I am shorting it."
Anyone short? Thinking of putting on a short position or buying some puts. They've worked hard to alienate their base. Thoughts?
The Shorts are getting killed and anyone still short DKS is responsible for the Dividends and cash will be taken out of their accounts to cover the dividend for the legal owner. It will be interesting to see what transpires leading up to the special dividend being paid out. I think this stock is headed higher. Leadership at DKS understands shareholder value.
"Seems like a pullback is coming, will buy in the high 80s but enjoy the slide till then"
"After 2000 Dow cut today, let's see if a bit rebound tomorrow, what if DKS delivers good results with rebounding Dow ?"

do not mix politics in with your business. buffet just warned business on this. glad I'm not invested in this...
"Can someone please explain why this stock has gone up since earnings were announced yesterday? Not that I’m complaining as I own few shares, but I just don’t see it."
$33 this week 
"This is not going to end well. Brick and mortar retail is already having problems, but when you attack half of the country, things are going to get rough.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/05/04/springfield-armory-abandons-dicks-sporting-goods-gun-control-lobbying/"
"DKS dividened reinstated, business is clearly booming...also keep an eye on BGFV (Big 5 Sporting Goods)...small cap sporting goods store on west coast, mkt cap only $45M, $1B in sales...big secular tailwind in sporting goods, and they also sell firearms and ammunition. One to watch."
I have two stores within 15 minutes of me and they are both always empty how can they maintain the high rent in the Mall of Georgia with five people in the store
"Today looks like a blow-off top from the euphoria of a dividend increase, not thinking about the fact that stores are being closed nationwide due to DKS hatred of its own largest customer base—firearms owners. Here comes the reckoning."
"I bailed out @ $35.95 this afternoon, after gift comeback."
Stephens & Co. PRICE TARGET 129. Actual DKS stock price 135. What's wrong with this picture?
I remember the original #$%$ store that my dad would always shop in. What a weird path this company has taken from small to large.Eventually it will be no more.Remember the focus for all businesses - customers.
"2nd rate store at best. Been in 3 of them, no reason to ever go back. Bass Pro, Scheel's and Cabelas are way better stores."
a terrible store compared to Academy I'm surprised they're still in business
Run away!
"Best in class retailer, evolved leadership (position on guns, human resources and pricing) and potential acquisition target.... I've never seen DKS management team let a controllable variable go sideways. Full disclosure - There is none longer than me on this equity bought it at the IPO strike price. 4600% increase later I'm expecting DKS to continue to serve the share holders and I will continue to critically own this stock."
Yes it is the perfect mix of Value and Rising Earnings…
Short squeeze looks like coming.
Shorted this 10 times today for + $2300.
"OLD RESISTANCE WILL BECOME NEW SUPPORT , COMPETITION FOR DKS IS SCARCE , THANK YOU COVID . THIS IS BOUNCING RIGHT BACK TO 100$"
DKS is down -5.04% to 30.92
yeah baby
Thank you #$%$ for giving the small gun shops more business. Corporations should not get involved in politics. There will be another leg down for this stock.
"Cracked $32 resistance. Time for a run to all time highs next week. Fair value $40 when compared to $DKS and $HIBB.Huge re-opening trade. Lots of sporting equipment will be needed, not only retail but for schools and businesses. Still waaaaaaay too many shorts in this and heavily underwater. Let me know when they cover."
Yeah the real problem is that DKS products are sooooo much more expensive than WMT or TGT. The stores in my area were empty even before Covid-19.
"Gotta say I'm surprised to see there was more upside to DKS today. Congrats to those who have squeezed even more out of this stock this past week. Still think it's greedy to keep expecting more and not take profits but hey - so far it's been working. One day it'll have a really good pullback. Monday? The following week? Who knows. Anyways, considering much of the market went on a pretty good bullish run today, through to close, I'm not so sure it's anything particularly special about DKS's extended upside direction. It seems it was just alot of bullish type buying in general. As for the special dividend coming, it may not work out as well as you might think. Check out RKT after they attempted to push out the short positions by special dividend. Didn't phase things one bit. In fact the share price ended up dropping pretty bad despite a raging+ home/mortgage situation we've had this year. DKS is now in the analyst new ranges and one bad market day + profit-taking could send this back 5-10% fairly easy."
"$37.10 close....hm, could it be ah manipulation to short pre market or actual bullish movement. Either way as long it opens RED I'm happy lol ........"
Stack needs to be sued for breach of fiduciary duty. He is knowingly harming investors.
"All this is going to do is make most hunters fisherman and outdoorsman in general who are pro 2A look else where for their supplies. Liberals may be happy but I doubt they will be flocking in to buy golf clubs and footballs just because the store wont be selling ""assault rifles""."
"The urban stores will endure the loss of the hunt line. However the rural locations and the stores in small cities will have a difficult time. Country folk don't buy fan gear like city people, instead they buy things that contribute to their existence. The things that help feed you and keep you warm are the priority not the Labron James jersey. It's not just guns, it's the whole hunt line including camo, deer lure, ammo, tree stands, safes, bows, arrows, duck calls, decoys, scopes and mounts, binoculars, gun slings, solvents and cleaning kits... The list could go on. Look at where the stores are located then eliminate any that are outside the fan gear markets. I was a customer when their were only 2 stores, it will be sad to see them go."
"Stock may be climbing again, but I'll never buy from them again.."
Am I reading this correctly? Instead of an expected loss of .09 a share they reported a 1.71 loss per share?
"it's the next gander mtn, out of business soon...."
take profits this wont last.....
Shareholders paying the price for liberal CEOs political views ?
"It's official. When the firearms industry is a little weak and they refuse to sell to a retailer, that should speak volumes about the retailer!Many gun owners happen to be finicky as it is. They would usually prefer to support a small local gun store as opposed to a big multi-national chain.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/05/10/mossberg-joins-springfield-armory-nssf-cutting-ties-dicks-sporting-goods/"
Good time to short this.
Freedom of speech is getting wiped out by big tech companies. Yahoo has deleted my last two post
Let's see I notice a 59.08 stock price a couple years ago. Gosh I wonder what could have happened to this stock
So much for all the Debbie downers bad mouthing the company when they got rid of the firearms …
I think my favorite thing about Yahoo boards is reading pessimistic shorts crying about successful businesses.
Love how a boycott proves the power is in the peoples hands and not their political stance.
Should I buy this dip???
Will never shop there and certainly will never invest there. CEO thinks it's a good idea to take millions of $ worth of perfectly sellable inventory and shred it into scrap metal due to flip flopping personal beliefs. how does that feel as a shareholder?
Too bad they got political.
Where’s Jesse ? I’ll take all the $135 bags you’ve got lol
"already facing negative earnings growth, the board should replace the ceo.... yesterday."
Why is this down?
Not shopping there after Stack's publicity stunt at expense of 2A
Glad this fell today. I don’t have skin in the game here. I told myself I would never buy stock of this company after they entered the political scheme and took a hard left turn about a year ago.
Nothing but a publicity stunt...they were going down the crapper anyhow.
Another company that did not understand who their customer base is. Starbucks or gone bucks is another
buying puts
"DKS ripped me off on their Score card.Did you know that if you purchase anything using Score card reward and return the item purchased,you lose your reward.So I returned a pair of shoes and lost the $10 reward.After spending hundreds of Dollars,never spent there again.Way to lose customers.Would be better if they didn't have the program,than to rip customers off,through the program.Good to see their same store sales falling."
"Anyone remember the days when this was a sporting goods stock, trading in the 60's (dec 2016), and not in the social justice business? This stock has lost 1/2 it's value in 30 months in one of the greatest bull market runs ever. Wonder how it will do when we have a real bear market. JS."
$BJ $CSCO $DKS i should have bullish with these stocks..
The store's name says it all.
"Hunters will boycott the stores even more now, leaving a bunch of overpriced sports team stuff that fewer and fewer people are buying. The rest can be bought online or at Walmart. Cabellas/Bass Pro will eat their lunch in the outdoor/hunting space which accounted for about 1/4 of the floor space last store I was in (which was about a year ago). The store was nearly empty on a Sat afternoon."
"Wow I said 10% was my expectation yesterday, it did that before the opening. Those were fantastic earnings!! Let’s see 20%+ today"
They blamed on UA for bad ER then try to revamp underperforming brand . DKS should be under 30 already .
"Is DKS even going to be profitable in 2023? :) I have never seen a sporting goods chain or electronics store not go out of business let along one that has to compete with Amazon. History always repeats itself so for new buyers on all this volume today, be very careful.Great quarter for DKS but very leary of this price point. This is the accountant in me speaking."
Academy is a hundred times better than this store
Going to short the stock big time tomorrow morning.
$140 here we come !
Love watching this company go bankrupt. Karma
"Destroying merchandise to make a political statement....? Time to short, this is the next Gander Mountain."
Out of my position for now I will get back in one week or so .

17% of the float shorted - that was covering today - not sure why the media can’t call out a play
Hey Jeff...hows that again about telling the NRA they're wrong......ba ha ha ha ha
"Obviously most people complaining doesn't own much to no stock in company, removing guns from stores doesn't hurt them and they are improving overall financially."
Sell for crash tomorrow
Over bought
Disappointing as a stockholder to see them take this position on gun sales. Sales on everything else is down so why get rid of staple proven product lines with decent margin. Mossberg just released press release stating they will stop all sales to #$%$. I anticipate other manufacturers will follow. Maybe this CEO should go to work for Kmart or Sears. That's where this company is headed. I'm dumping this stock.
"It’s going to fall another 10-15% after tomorrow, ex-div date. Come to $30. Great for my put options."
Serious correction today. Look for a pop back to new high and beyond before next earnings
OK I just joined the NRA
Never owned this stock but the special dividend Is very enticing! Should you buy just for dividend?
Sports authority 2.0
"Stack said in an interview that if halting the sale certain rifles prevents one death it's worth it. Couldn't the same be said about kayak sales or selling pool toys. There are many children killed in activities like swimming and boating but you don't see them destroying kayaks. Also note the ages of some of the young people behind the gun counter selling guns. Many are not 21, why? Because they are cheap labor. Serious consistency issues with Stack."
Eventually will go out of business. All big box stores will unless they have their own brand
DKS is down -4.92% to 33.82
Shorted yesterday. Got out this morning. Git 'er done!!!!
"Go against the 2nd Amendment, go against your customers, go against your suppliers, and you go against profit. Go against profiit and you go against the share price. Eventually, any sporting goods business run in such a fashion will FAIL."
"Shorts have been feeding shares to buyers all morning, especially in high 120's."
Time to short
Over 17% of the float is shorts in DKS. This should be a fun day
"No worries, this is good to $40 in short time"
"In other news, NVDA, a gigantic and significant player, is up only 200% since pre-pandemic high, and 320% since pandemic low. You do the math and deductive reasoning. PS. I just picked a random stock, without overthinking it."
Just SSSHHHHORTED AT $144.09
this is a 40 stock at best.
"Some of you folks here are super hung up on DKS being a retailer . I mean why should a retailer get any love these days ?Well DKS has adapted to the changing market and is thriving - it’s got great cash flow , a splendid growth rate and manageable debt at around 19% . I agree - retailing is a scary business but SOME folks do it well in their niche ( WMT & M to name a couple ). Will DKS be thriving in 10 years ? I dunno . I’d probably be more likely to bet on WalMart that far out , but for now they’ve got it going on !"
"DKS is history. Pandering to the left who are the minority and not the majority when it comes to law abiding citizens. Obviously the majority of us law abiding citizens, otherwise who is paying the income taxes for the roads and funding the bloated guvt'? The genius' on the left are rapidly destroying our country."
"After hours running well, I think we will see +10% tomorrow"
I sold half my shares in the 70's 
BTW the $5 dollar special dividend comes off the stock price the day of payout. So if it closes the prior day 131 it opens at 125 and those who didn't time it right and did not get the dividend get screwed $5 off their stock.
"This is a sure-fire, gangbusters short. The CEO of the company has destroyed the company and the stock."
They lost their niche market. DKSQhttps://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2018/11/30/gun-sales-low-dicks-may-yank-hunting-gear/
Hard to believe they're even still around with their high prices.
As an investor not in this lifetime will I buy this stock nor a fund that invests in this stock. Additionally no one in my family will ever step in a store. This company is anti constitution therefore anti America. Love this country? Then don't shop there.
how come i am not allowed to spell the full name of the company? my post gets deleted. but if i say i love DKS that is not a problem. there is some weird things going on here.
Short squeeze it could run multiple days with 15 % float shorted.
I hope they go out of business
Never shopping here again
I’m going to buy some put options before the market closes. I know there’s a lot of articles being optimistic but I feel like specialty stores like DKS will suffer from coronavirus. Hoping the price keeps going up so put options are cheaper. Feed back anyone
Plenty of parking in front of DKS.
I'm out. Dumping shares this am. Politics and retail don't mix for me.
Alienating a large percentage of customers is very bad business practice. I'll never shop there again.
"Bought DKS at the strike prices almost 20 years ago.... Split adjusted $3. per share. It's been, and will continue to be a wonderful ride. One of the more knowledgeable cadre's of retail leadership in the business. Keep it up and Thank you, Investor"
Buffett warned CEOs to leave their liberal politics to home-now the CONSEQUENCES !
"DKS has been cut off by many of the gun mfgs. It has been boycotted by an ever growing number of Patriotic Americans who believe in the Constitution. Look at the NFL, down year over year. People who were purchasing guns and gun supplies at DKS were also purchasing from their entire line. The long term outlook for growth among existing units is negative. You add Amazon into the picture and your investment is skating on thin ICE."
Wow.!! Single trade of 800k shares at $135 at 2:30 today
$34 fosho 
Nice Dividend Thanks
DKS is down -5.22% to 30.50
It’s way overbought. I will short this baby today .
I once was a frequent customer but after the CEO turned political I have not returned.
"REALLY.... sells at 97 times earnings, book value about $3.00 has 1.5 billion cash and almost $4 billion in debt,is in malls with high rents..TOTAL #$%$"
"Was Friday a bull trap? Stocks sure did rally despite world troubles (Afghanistan). Market may have a delayed reaction to it tomorrow. Add to it the situation unfolding in the gulf from Ida (gas supply and price concerns going forward), could have a bit of a bloody Monday to correct last week's upward movements. Might see a decent correction on this stock and others that rallied last week. DKS to $130? I would secure profits in premarket before that happens!"
"This is outstanding! If you’ve been on this a while, check out ASO. academy sports has ER June 8. Very similar story and still has a high short float too."
Great quarter again for retail!!!!! Now i persoanlly think DKS is worth $75 per share. Stimulus will run out eventually and be spent on the new increase in real estate property of the consummers.
"Not short, But I did sell my 1,000 of Delta, I will not shop in any store or support anything company or person that uses influence push a political agenda........ when will they learn?"
Relief rally it will tank again.Most of what they sell came from China.The tariffs will trim their margin. IMO
No gun sales... Now no Hunting gear. My favorite store gone to the Snow Flakes!! I have a credit card from them. Not any longer. I am out. Not shopping there again. I wil go to Cabelas or Bass Pro.... I also will tell a lot of friend about it!! they are going to loose a lot of business. hence the stock down 5% today!!
Hobby and recreational products are not so important if you don’t have a job. This sector of retail could be down for quite some time.
