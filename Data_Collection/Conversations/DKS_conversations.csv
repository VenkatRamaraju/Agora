"Interesting spot, going to pick some up. Great company, fantastic earnings, price targets of $145+"
DKS behaved almost exactly as it did Friday except for the weakness in the afternoon before the close . My feeling was it would top out ( for now ) at 140 something which it did . I’ll be watching this tomorrow but I expect it to sell off a bit - normal profit taking plus some vulture short sellers ( sorry short sellers I’m just not a big fan of the process ).
"Not a great trade stock with the low volune but a good long play. Also kind of singled out in its sector, many other similar retail stores are privately owned(Cabela, Bass Pro, REI). Also, very small debt…"
wait until their next 10-Q when all the gun sales are not showing up on the sheet... this stock will be 15 before year end...
Almost no upside resistance now . Short sellers are closing positions in an orderly fashion - for now .
Sinking like a rock damn down 15 point by Tommorrow end day trading never expected sell off before ex dividend
This will be a wise investment
What time is earnings tomorrow so I can sell close my call after spike
If had money buy it today end of the day and ride it back to 145
Going to short the stock big time tomorrow morning.
Love how a boycott proves the power is in the peoples hands and not their political stance.
Today I sold my DKS at 131. I got in at 50! My best score in a long time. Thank you DKS.
Hard to believe they're even still around with their high prices.
Shorted yesterday. Got out this morning. Git 'er done!!!!
Over 17% of the float is shorts in DKS. This should be a fun day
"Getting expelled from the NSSF which is the largest outdoor trade group is not a good sign... Having several of your larger vendors drop you is also not good.. Local to me the (DKS) sporting goods is like a ghost town, academy is fairly busy.. But Academy is selling what the people want and at a lower price from what I could tell."
"Dropped -12.6%, WOW !"
Cashed out $137 calls . Nothing wrong with taking some profits . My opinion on DKS has not changed .
Great quarter again for retail!!!!! Now i persoanlly think DKS is worth $75 per share. Stimulus will run out eventually and be spent on the new increase in real estate property of the consummers.
"DKS is history. Pandering to the left who are the minority and not the majority when it comes to law abiding citizens. Obviously the majority of us law abiding citizens, otherwise who is paying the income taxes for the roads and funding the bloated guvt'? The genius' on the left are rapidly destroying our country."
I’m going to buy some put options before the market closes. I know there’s a lot of articles being optimistic but I feel like specialty stores like DKS will suffer from coronavirus. Hoping the price keeps going up so put options are cheaper. Feed back anyone
"Maybe not very soon, but this, along with may other stocks will plunge, like a peregrine falcon. NO DOUBT. I am trying to earn more money outside the markets, so I can add to my shorts."
"Options NO more trading by now on DSK.... this ain't good..... I,m short on call 140 and 145 but just added some short on the stock to $132+...."

Never shopping here again
"Insiders selling, read the filings"
Warren Buffet warned business 3 days ago to keep your political views out of your business.
"Shattered all records, buy the dip if you can. Great company sharing the profits with a dividend increase. "
Hope you followed my advises for months on DKS. Investing is a real job and that’s my job. Patience and quality always pay off.
OK I just joined the NRA
"Today looks like a blow-off top from the euphoria of a dividend increase, not thinking about the fact that stores are being closed nationwide due to DKS hatred of its own largest customer base—firearms owners. Here comes the reckoning."
Why are people shorting this stock?
Regret DKS became overtly political. Forced me to stop buying there once they took a position hostile to my views. I had bought ammo there regularly. No more. Same store sales are down. Maybe having an effect. Principles matter and have consequences.
Alienating a large percentage of customers is very bad business practice. I'll never shop there again.
can't wait to buy at $60
$3 stock
Who’s buying puts now homies ? I wish I had jumped back in this morning . Wowza !
How can Credit Suisse have a price target of 123 when the stock sits at 129. Most other upgrades are 150 to 175. Doesn't say much for Credit Suisse.
$140... tomorrow
Hobby and recreational products are not so important if you don’t have a job. This sector of retail could be down for quite some time.
I'll find somewhere else to shop thank you! Stay away from Political compares. The majority of people in the USA support the 2nd

"This is outstanding! If you’ve been on this a while, check out ASO. academy sports has ER June 8. Very similar story and still has a high short float too."
this premarket$6.00 drop is because of ex dividend date today.
"After 2000 Dow cut today, let's see if a bit rebound tomorrow, what if DKS delivers good results with rebounding Dow ?"
Remember buying this at $135 longs? Hahahahahahaha!
My ====D keeps going up!
Yup writing on wall 150 December
Is this safe to hold 130 til fri?
"buying more dks with the dividends . looking good for Christmas sales, dip in price. Seems like dks is super shareholder friendly. "
"just opened huge store. Great time to buy in this dip., "
The store's name says it all.
I remember the original #$%$ store that my dad would always shop in. What a weird path this company has taken from small to large.Eventually it will be no more.Remember the focus for all businesses - customers.
They won’t have merchandises to sell .Lock down plus power crunch and chain supplies snafu.
Buffett warned CEOs to leave their liberal politics to home-now the CONSEQUENCES !
shorted a thousand shares at 54.18 this is one short I'm not worried about
Poor company to invest in. Poor customer service and anti-gun. I'll use anyone but what the name implies
what's this about fraud I have a feeling something bad is about to come out
Shorted this 10 times today for + $2300.
Freedom of speech is getting wiped out by big tech companies. Yahoo has deleted my last two post
I sold half my shares in the 70's 
"Amazing report, just incredible....Adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.01 in the latest quarter, crushing the FactSet-survey-derived analyst consensus of $1.08.Sales soared 23% to $2.41 billion from $1.96 billion. The latest figure beat the FactSet analyst consensus of $2.24 billion.Same-store sales jumped 23.2% in the latest quarter, besting the analyst consensus of 13%. Digital sales skyrocketed 95%, constituting 21% of total sales."
Buy buy dividends time . By Xmas time we be at 200
Hey Jeff...hows that again about telling the NRA they're wrong......ba ha ha ha ha
"Destroying merchandise to make a political statement....? Time to short, this is the next Gander Mountain."
"Stock may be climbing again, but I'll never buy from them again.."
"@OptionTrader8- so, did you find anything out? You said you were going to talk to the CBOE? I don't trade options and curious about your claim that there will be lawsuits. Lawsuits against who? I'll tell you this. Short interest was just reported for period ending 8/31 on #$%$ Blew me away that short interest actually went up 5 days after earnings. While a temporary pull back is expected after such a strong run, if the shorts don't get out, they are going to get killed again. The average EPS for this current quarter is $1.81. #$%$ will blow that away again and raise their forecast again just like they keep doing. This company is too well run and making too much money to short it. Maybe short it next year when it gets over $175 and they are up against tough comps."
Wow stores loaded with people . Heard no discounts inventory low which means more money
Over extended.....consolidation imminent.
Bass Pro Shop is so much better than this place. They better not try to write off all that inventory they are willingly destroying.
Never owned this stock but the special dividend Is very enticing! Should you buy just for dividend?
"Let me see, these guys are destroying perfectly good inventory to make a political statement which will drive away MORE of their customers. Yup, seems like a great business plan."
Again and again dks has proven to be a reliable stock

"I wouldn't be surprised to see a nice gap down coming in the coming days.... well, not that I need it.... but usually, cboe do NOT halt stock options trading like this....."
Shorts have to cover by Wednesday 9/8/ that's when you will see 150.
Fraudulent companies don't pay out special dividends at $5.50.... actually this company seems shareholder friendly... glad they didn't sell guns low profit a lot of paper work and liabilities.... 
Not much to complain about with the special whopping dividend payout today!!
Should I stay or should I go
"Is DKS even going to be profitable in 2023? :) I have never seen a sporting goods chain or electronics store not go out of business let along one that has to compete with Amazon. History always repeats itself so for new buyers on all this volume today, be very careful.Great quarter for DKS but very leary of this price point. This is the accountant in me speaking."
"Best in class retailer, evolved leadership (position on guns, human resources and pricing) and potential acquisition target.... I've never seen DKS management team let a controllable variable go sideways. Full disclosure - There is none longer than me on this equity bought it at the IPO strike price. 4600% increase later I'm expecting DKS to continue to serve the share holders and I will continue to critically own this stock."
The shorts turned Tuesday into Thursday.
Gotta say I was ready at 9:30 AM to go all in . I hesitated when I saw it go up then down then up then way down then back up then way up then way down . I can’t reliably do short term trades with that kind of volatility as I’d end up buying too high . But I’m seriously bullish on DKS and will be taking a position next week .
I’m new and entered at 116. Is it fine to keep it long ?
People should pick this stock its gonna rise because of sport season.
This price level will be history ?
down but on low volume. cp up on big volume.
Current PE ratio is 8.9. There are articles being published using the old PE ratio of 19 before earnings. Yahoo needs to be quicker with updating financial ratios after earnings.
Sell before too late
$$140. at close... somehow this economy is looking good.... 
17% of the float shorted - that was covering today - not sure why the media can’t call out a play
Run away!
"The management of this company leaves me shaking my head. Headlines like this one will keep popping up as long as the company continues to disrespect firearms owners in America, whether that's those interested in self defense, general marksmanship, or hunting.https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/01/28/lawsuit-against-dicks-sporting-goods-over.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
Bought at $57 and I think it’s time to take some off the top
So much for all the Debbie downers bad mouthing the company when they got rid of the firearms …
No gun sales... Now no Hunting gear. My favorite store gone to the Snow Flakes!! I have a credit card from them. Not any longer. I am out. Not shopping there again. I wil go to Cabelas or Bass Pro.... I also will tell a lot of friend about it!! they are going to loose a lot of business. hence the stock down 5% today!!
Sports authority 2.0
You just have to hold until open tomorrow to get $5.93 div. As I understand it'll drop $5.93 at least and I fear big profit taking after open given big run since earnings
Allllllllllllll aboard!
DKS is down -5.22% to 30.50
DKS will implode just like KSS and NIKE.
"As predicted, weekly option strikes were added at every $1, up to $150.."
"My concern is this has surged on earnings but no Sellers yet, holding for div. But on Thurs I wonder if this sells off hard. Only have to hold until after it opens Thurs then you sell and still get the 5.93 div. Shares will drop the amount of div at open and it seems like a lot of profit selling that day."
Over bought
"Another price upgrade, this time by Morgan Stanley, let’s go!! 135 today!"
were they considered essential? How come DKS couldnt catch a bid before epidemic and now with their stores mostly shutdown trhey become a powerhouse
Dks is a strong company that will no doubt double its market cap in the next year
"Here's the trick hold the stock after a big pop up.. Add options strike at every dollars to attrack as many puts buyers as you can. Those feed MMs and makes it easy for them to hold the stock and push it even higher... those were added at every dollar up to $145, that exactly the strike I've written...Be sure cboe is going to add strike at every dollar above $145(instead of $5), naturally its going to help MMs to pop AND hold the stock higher... MMs are now in a squeeze mode as the short position is high on this stock, some buyback but new shorts are adding.... Could easily hit $150+ ,(as long as the market doesn't pull back)... waiting another +$5,$10 fast before thinkng of going short, probably writing call spread..."
we not sure of what we have no proof of. but if people short or sell that's legal and part of the game If the suits secretly bought thousands of shares and we benefited we wouldn't complain. Bottom line this stock will be huge in the next few weeks. I've seen this same sell off many times with huge companies and they all came back and surpassed the losses. really no worries. 
"My Puts aren't showing up in my account ??? But my long positions with big deduct ? When do puts ""reappear"" and what's the damage to them?"
BTW the $5 dollar special dividend comes off the stock price the day of payout. So if it closes the prior day 131 it opens at 125 and those who didn't time it right and did not get the dividend get screwed $5 off their stock.
"Wow I said 10% was my expectation yesterday, it did that before the opening. Those were fantastic earnings!! Let’s see 20%+ today"
"Some of you folks here are super hung up on DKS being a retailer . I mean why should a retailer get any love these days ?Well DKS has adapted to the changing market and is thriving - it’s got great cash flow , a splendid growth rate and manageable debt at around 19% . I agree - retailing is a scary business but SOME folks do it well in their niche ( WMT & M to name a couple ). Will DKS be thriving in 10 years ? I dunno . I’d probably be more likely to bet on WalMart that far out , but for now they’ve got it going on !"
"Also very pump and dump , down for the count @ -21% / should have shorted it"
So I guess the selloff will continue till tomorrow? XD day?
Look like options could be back for trading this morning.... let see.....
Wow.!! Single trade of 800k shares at $135 at 2:30 today
The shorts will never be in control of this stock for long!!!
"I'd sell while you still have $135 on this. Be grateful, not greedy, for the kind of gains this has handed you this week. I'm not so sure that tomorrow, Fed speak & Friday, is going to continue the upward price movement you're hoping for. $125 was reasonable, $135 was a gift."
"Now would be a good time for the co. to start buying shares, they could save on the dividend."
Was the recent special dividend previously announced?
Why is this down?
"DKS has been cut off by many of the gun mfgs. It has been boycotted by an ever growing number of Patriotic Americans who believe in the Constitution. Look at the NFL, down year over year. People who were purchasing guns and gun supplies at DKS were also purchasing from their entire line. The long term outlook for growth among existing units is negative. You add Amazon into the picture and your investment is skating on thin ICE."
I'm out. Dumping shares this am. Politics and retail don't mix for me.
Anyone short? Thinking of putting on a short position or buying some puts. They've worked hard to alienate their base. Thoughts?
"I still buy Under Armor, I still buy guns. But after they politicized themselves over gun control, I buy nothing from them. This company will he gone, sold, or greatly reduced in size before long."
"I don't know why there are those that want to short a company doing as well as DKS. Is it because you are short it now and wanting to talk it down and add to your position, so you don't get killed as badly? It really makes no sense. Take your losses and find a better (worse) company to short. It is true that there is a disparity in Retail right now where some have figured it out and others have not. DKS is killing it. The short squeeze is on right now! DKS management understands shareholder value better than most companies. If you short a company that just absolutely smashed earnings, raised their regular dividend and announced a special dividend of $5.50 per share, doubled their stock buyback program and raised their forecast for the rest of the year (BTW, they will beat that too and raise again next quarter!), then you really don't know what you are doing and must like losing money. Seriously."
yeah baby
$BJ $CSCO $DKS i should have bullish with these stocks..
CEO lives in a gated community with armed guards.
DKS is down -4.92% to 33.82
"Longs, be VERY careful here, $132 and cboe halted options trading o the stock..... It has something really bad going on..."
"This stock is overvalued at 110. However, the company is doing well to increase to this level; buyback or dividend."
Short squeeze it could run multiple days with 15 % float shorted.
"Nike cuts forecast will impact DKS , there’s too much expectation here any snafu we could see 20% hair cut . IMO"
After hours this will flourish to 138-140
"Jackson Hole event tomorrow, be careful guys"
"Cracked $32 resistance. Time for a run to all time highs next week. Fair value $40 when compared to $DKS and $HIBB.Huge re-opening trade. Lots of sporting equipment will be needed, not only retail but for schools and businesses. Still waaaaaaay too many shorts in this and heavily underwater. Let me know when they cover."
"Gotta say I'm surprised to see there was more upside to DKS today. Congrats to those who have squeezed even more out of this stock this past week. Still think it's greedy to keep expecting more and not take profits but hey - so far it's been working. One day it'll have a really good pullback. Monday? The following week? Who knows. Anyways, considering much of the market went on a pretty good bullish run today, through to close, I'm not so sure it's anything particularly special about DKS's extended upside direction. It seems it was just alot of bullish type buying in general. As for the special dividend coming, it may not work out as well as you might think. Check out RKT after they attempted to push out the short positions by special dividend. Didn't phase things one bit. In fact the share price ended up dropping pretty bad despite a raging+ home/mortgage situation we've had this year. DKS is now in the analyst new ranges and one bad market day + profit-taking could send this back 5-10% fairly easy."

"it's the next gander mtn, out of business soon...."
Now that CBOE Halted ALL options trading... U better expect a Big rop soon....
The role of a corporate CEO is to maximize profits and stock price not implement social change that at least half of his clientele (more at F&S) disagree with. Smart money is outta here.

"Shorts have been feeding shares to buyers all morning, especially in high 120's."
take profits this wont last.....
"Bought DKS at the strike prices almost 20 years ago.... Split adjusted $3. per share. It's been, and will continue to be a wonderful ride. One of the more knowledgeable cadre's of retail leadership in the business. Keep it up and Thank you, Investor"
"nice short squeeze today, still losing my a---- on this thing"
Why does this keep going up?
Yes it’s down today - perhaps in sympathy with a big Dow drop we’ll over 200 points - but it DID hit a new all time high today at one point despite the tepid close .
It’s way overbought. I will short this baby today .
"The urban stores will endure the loss of the hunt line. However the rural locations and the stores in small cities will have a difficult time. Country folk don't buy fan gear like city people, instead they buy things that contribute to their existence. The things that help feed you and keep you warm are the priority not the Labron James jersey. It's not just guns, it's the whole hunt line including camo, deer lure, ammo, tree stands, safes, bows, arrows, duck calls, decoys, scopes and mounts, binoculars, gun slings, solvents and cleaning kits... The list could go on. Look at where the stores are located then eliminate any that are outside the fan gear markets. I was a customer when their were only 2 stores, it will be sad to see them go."
"DKS dividened reinstated, business is clearly booming...also keep an eye on BGFV (Big 5 Sporting Goods)...small cap sporting goods store on west coast, mkt cap only $45M, $1B in sales...big secular tailwind in sporting goods, and they also sell firearms and ammunition. One to watch."
Stephens & Co. PRICE TARGET 129. Actual DKS stock price 135. What's wrong with this picture?
"If the management is fraud, what can we do? they pumped the price by a special div, then dumped."
150 could be today.
they will show in your position acct and that's where you can sell them from
"Used to shop here all the time and get tons of coupons, never buying from them again!"
Be sure.... lawsuits are already on the go........
Not only would I not buy this stock I would not set foot in there stores !!!
covering some shares shorted many points higher.... and writing some puts différents strike to partly hedge my profit...
"Anyone remember the days when this was a sporting goods stock, trading in the 60's (dec 2016), and not in the social justice business? This stock has lost 1/2 it's value in 30 months in one of the greatest bull market runs ever. Wonder how it will do when we have a real bear market. JS."
Dividend related drop?
Thinking of a run to 35
Thanks to all you longs for your financing my call girls and blow regiment 
I should have sold my weekly puts on GME rather than this but I did not due to the earning call on GME yesterday. Who would have thought a stock with a PE ratio of 11 would go down like this in a couple of days. Now I have to sell covered calls until I recover.
Got a job there yesterday. Go teammates!
"After hours running well, I think we will see +10% tomorrow"
This is really overpriced for what it is but okay lol
$140 here we come !
Glad this fell today. I don’t have skin in the game here. I told myself I would never buy stock of this company after they entered the political scheme and took a hard left turn about a year ago.
Another company that did not understand who their customer base is. Starbucks or gone bucks is another
The Shorts are getting killed and anyone still short DKS is responsible for the Dividends and cash will be taken out of their accounts to cover the dividend for the legal owner. It will be interesting to see what transpires leading up to the special dividend being paid out. I think this stock is headed higher. Leadership at DKS understands shareholder value.
New 52 week high congrats longs ! It’s still flying !
My thoughts should hit 150 Tommorrow or Wednesday . Brisk sales and ex dividend Thursday

"Was Friday a bull trap? Stocks sure did rally despite world troubles (Afghanistan). Market may have a delayed reaction to it tomorrow. Add to it the situation unfolding in the gulf from Ida (gas supply and price concerns going forward), could have a bit of a bloody Monday to correct last week's upward movements. Might see a decent correction on this stock and others that rallied last week. DKS to $130? I would secure profits in premarket before that happens!"
I sold at $131
The way I see it a couple of our holders got together and each sold a few million shares but not before buying 1000's of buts. That is why our exec sold shares before the dividend. mho
Where’s Jesse ? I’ll take all the $135 bags you’ve got lol
I think my favorite thing about Yahoo boards is reading pessimistic shorts crying about successful businesses.
ceo must go.
"buy low, or lower. Sell high. This sell off is about over regardless of dividends, they are baked in. .... last chance to get in below $136"
Clothing prices so expensive no matter what store you buy . This stock going hit 160 by Xmas
Out of my position for now I will get back in one week or so .
Thank You for the great dividends
Despite what what they say most of the posters are shorts.
Short squeeze taking place with DKS?
Sorry I am a new buyer of DKS. Not sure how this special dividend affects's today's price and see no news on it. I am losing big as I bought past week. Should I sell as this price drop is extreme unless a good reason for it like a special dividend. Thank you for any advise.
Shorting this to the low $120’s. You’ve been warned.
Too bad they got political.
"After their anti-gun policies, I have bought nothing from them. I know many others who feel the same. All of our kids sport clothes and gear is now purchased elsewhere..."
