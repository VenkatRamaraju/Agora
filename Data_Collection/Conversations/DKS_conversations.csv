Thanks to all you longs for your financing my call girls and blow regiment 
"DKS is history. Pandering to the left who are the minority and not the majority when it comes to law abiding citizens. Obviously the majority of us law abiding citizens, otherwise who is paying the income taxes for the roads and funding the bloated guvt'? The genius' on the left are rapidly destroying our country."
"Anyone remember the days when this was a sporting goods stock, trading in the 60's (dec 2016), and not in the social justice business? This stock has lost 1/2 it's value in 30 months in one of the greatest bull market runs ever. Wonder how it will do when we have a real bear market. JS."
Cashed out $137 calls . Nothing wrong with taking some profits . My opinion on DKS has not changed .
Sorry I am a new buyer of DKS. Not sure how this special dividend affects's today's price and see no news on it. I am losing big as I bought past week. Should I sell as this price drop is extreme unless a good reason for it like a special dividend. Thank you for any advise.
Despite what what they say most of the posters are shorts.
Yup writing on wall 150 December
Allllllllllllll aboard!
Dividend related drop?
If had money buy it today end of the day and ride it back to 145
Why the low volume
"Wow I said 10% was my expectation yesterday, it did that before the opening. Those were fantastic earnings!! Let’s see 20%+ today"
Academy is a hundred times better than this store
"If the management is fraud, what can we do? they pumped the price by a special div, then dumped."
"$ASO squeeze still on even after hours, $33.2040% of the float short after a solid earnings report.Not going to be surprised if it rips shorts faces off again tomorrow...$40 Strike Calls for May active today. Shorties offsides and still haven't panicked yet.$DKS $HIBB $BGFV"
Who’s buying puts now homies ? I wish I had jumped back in this morning . Wowza !
Shareholders paying the price for liberal CEOs political views ?

Stack needs to be sued for breach of fiduciary duty. He is knowingly harming investors.
"This is a dip, the earning report is higher than predicted, throughout the day it will explode"
Yes it’s down today - perhaps in sympathy with a big Dow drop we’ll over 200 points - but it DID hit a new all time high today at one point despite the tepid close .
Nothing but a publicity stunt...they were going down the crapper anyhow.
Be sure.... lawsuits are already on the go........
"Not short, But I did sell my 1,000 of Delta, I will not shop in any store or support anything company or person that uses influence push a political agenda........ when will they learn?"
"I'd sell while you still have $135 on this. Be grateful, not greedy, for the kind of gains this has handed you this week. I'm not so sure that tomorrow, Fed speak & Friday, is going to continue the upward price movement you're hoping for. $125 was reasonable, $135 was a gift."
"Stock may be climbing again, but I'll never buy from them again.."
$33 this week 
I’m going to buy some put options before the market closes. I know there’s a lot of articles being optimistic but I feel like specialty stores like DKS will suffer from coronavirus. Hoping the price keeps going up so put options are cheaper. Feed back anyone
"In other news, NVDA, a gigantic and significant player, is up only 200% since pre-pandemic high, and 320% since pandemic low. You do the math and deductive reasoning. PS. I just picked a random stock, without overthinking it."
$140... tomorrow
Not a good idea to invest in a company that has declared war on its own customers. SJWs now run the company and they have made it clear that they hate gun owners and are actively working to reduce the rights of those Americans.
150 could be today.
Short squeeze it could run multiple days with 15 % float shorted.
No gun sales... Now no Hunting gear. My favorite store gone to the Snow Flakes!! I have a credit card from them. Not any longer. I am out. Not shopping there again. I wil go to Cabelas or Bass Pro.... I also will tell a lot of friend about it!! they are going to loose a lot of business. hence the stock down 5% today!!
"Bought DKS at the strike prices almost 20 years ago.... Split adjusted $3. per share. It's been, and will continue to be a wonderful ride. One of the more knowledgeable cadre's of retail leadership in the business. Keep it up and Thank you, Investor"
OK I just joined the NRA
"already facing negative earnings growth, the board should replace the ceo.... yesterday."
"I wouldn't be surprised to see a nice gap down coming in the coming days.... well, not that I need it.... but usually, cboe do NOT halt stock options trading like this....."
wait until their next 10-Q when all the gun sales are not showing up on the sheet... this stock will be 15 before year end...
Should I stay or should I go
$34 fosho 
Over 17% of the float is shorts in DKS. This should be a fun day
Not shopping there after Stack's publicity stunt at expense of 2A
Stephens & Co. PRICE TARGET 129. Actual DKS stock price 135. What's wrong with this picture?

"Seems like a pullback is coming, will buy in the high 80s but enjoy the slide till then"
My ====D keeps going up!
"After 2000 Dow cut today, let's see if a bit rebound tomorrow, what if DKS delivers good results with rebounding Dow ?"
"nice short squeeze today, still losing my a---- on this thing"
People went there to buy guns?
This is really overpriced for what it is but okay lol
The shorts will never be in control of this stock for long!!!
DKS what a great globalist company. Distb. of goods made by child slave labor from countries that hate the USA. Goodluck all longs going to 0. LUV YALL
"Insiders selling, read the filings"
I sold half my shares in the 70's 
So I guess the selloff will continue till tomorrow? XD day?

"This is outstanding! If you’ve been on this a while, check out ASO. academy sports has ER June 8. Very similar story and still has a high short float too."
Another new 52 week high ! Congrats longs !!
DKS behaved almost exactly as it did Friday except for the weakness in the afternoon before the close . My feeling was it would top out ( for now ) at 140 something which it did . I’ll be watching this tomorrow but I expect it to sell off a bit - normal profit taking plus some vulture short sellers ( sorry short sellers I’m just not a big fan of the process ).
buying puts
$$140. at close... somehow this economy is looking good.... 
Thinking of a run to 35
"Was Friday a bull trap? Stocks sure did rally despite world troubles (Afghanistan). Market may have a delayed reaction to it tomorrow. Add to it the situation unfolding in the gulf from Ida (gas supply and price concerns going forward), could have a bit of a bloody Monday to correct last week's upward movements. Might see a decent correction on this stock and others that rallied last week. DKS to $130? I would secure profits in premarket before that happens!"
Good time to short this.
$135 bags for sale!
DKS is down -5.22% to 30.50
Over bought
Another company that did not understand who their customer base is. Starbucks or gone bucks is another
How does a moderate earnings beat justify a >25% boost?
were they considered essential? How come DKS couldnt catch a bid before epidemic and now with their stores mostly shutdown trhey become a powerhouse
I think my favorite thing about Yahoo boards is reading pessimistic shorts crying about successful businesses.
Anyone short? Thinking of putting on a short position or buying some puts. They've worked hard to alienate their base. Thoughts?
Hard to believe they're even still around with their high prices.
Thank you #$%$ for giving the small gun shops more business. Corporations should not get involved in politics. There will be another leg down for this stock.
Man. It’s the name of the store. You’re not supposed to take one 
Never owned this stock but the special dividend Is very enticing! Should you buy just for dividend?
Bass Pro Shop is so much better than this place. They better not try to write off all that inventory they are willingly destroying.
This price level will be history ?
Gotta say I was ready at 9:30 AM to go all in . I hesitated when I saw it go up then down then up then way down then back up then way up then way down . I can’t reliably do short term trades with that kind of volatility as I’d end up buying too high . But I’m seriously bullish on DKS and will be taking a position next week .
The store's name says it all.
we not sure of what we have no proof of. but if people short or sell that's legal and part of the game If the suits secretly bought thousands of shares and we benefited we wouldn't complain. Bottom line this stock will be huge in the next few weeks. I've seen this same sell off many times with huge companies and they all came back and surpassed the losses. really no worries. 
Love watching this company go bankrupt. Karma
"Longs, be VERY careful here, $132 and cboe halted options trading o the stock..... It has something really bad going on..."
"Options NO more trading by now on DSK.... this ain't good..... I,m short on call 140 and 145 but just added some short on the stock to $132+...."
"Get out while you can, upset the hunting community watch the stock drop"
"The urban stores will endure the loss of the hunt line. However the rural locations and the stores in small cities will have a difficult time. Country folk don't buy fan gear like city people, instead they buy things that contribute to their existence. The things that help feed you and keep you warm are the priority not the Labron James jersey. It's not just guns, it's the whole hunt line including camo, deer lure, ammo, tree stands, safes, bows, arrows, duck calls, decoys, scopes and mounts, binoculars, gun slings, solvents and cleaning kits... The list could go on. Look at where the stores are located then eliminate any that are outside the fan gear markets. I was a customer when their were only 2 stores, it will be sad to see them go."
Look like options could be back for trading this morning.... let see.....
The Shorts are getting killed and anyone still short DKS is responsible for the Dividends and cash will be taken out of their accounts to cover the dividend for the legal owner. It will be interesting to see what transpires leading up to the special dividend being paid out. I think this stock is headed higher. Leadership at DKS understands shareholder value.
Is this safe to hold 130 til fri?
Not only would I not buy this stock I would not set foot in there stores !!!
Over priced anyway. Shop anywhere else and save money
So much for all the Debbie downers bad mouthing the company when they got rid of the firearms …
lol...over inflated company
$3 stock
"The management of this company leaves me shaking my head. Headlines like this one will keep popping up as long as the company continues to disrespect firearms owners in America, whether that's those interested in self defense, general marksmanship, or hunting.https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/01/28/lawsuit-against-dicks-sporting-goods-over.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"

Why are people shorting this stock?
Great quarter again for retail!!!!! Now i persoanlly think DKS is worth $75 per share. Stimulus will run out eventually and be spent on the new increase in real estate property of the consummers.
My thoughts should hit 150 Tommorrow or Wednesday . Brisk sales and ex dividend Thursday
Why is this down?
What time is earnings tomorrow so I can sell close my call after spike
I have two stores within 15 minutes of me and they are both always empty how can they maintain the high rent in the Mall of Georgia with five people in the store
Earnings 0730 ET Wednesday
"Good to see so many new shorts on board. Today's bloodbath is just the beginning of DKS's decline and ultimate fall. I've made a lot of money shorting DKS since they came out swinging against their own customers, but today was epic. Way better than any long positions!"
"Today looks like a blow-off top from the euphoria of a dividend increase, not thinking about the fact that stores are being closed nationwide due to DKS hatred of its own largest customer base—firearms owners. Here comes the reckoning."
Anyone short will have to pay the dividend.
Shorted this 10 times today for + $2300.
BTW the $5 dollar special dividend comes off the stock price the day of payout. So if it closes the prior day 131 it opens at 125 and those who didn't time it right and did not get the dividend get screwed $5 off their stock.
Hey Jeff...hows that again about telling the NRA they're wrong......ba ha ha ha ha
Sinking like a rock damn down 15 point by Tommorrow end day trading never expected sell off before ex dividend
Short squeeze taking place with DKS?
"DKS has been cut off by many of the gun mfgs. It has been boycotted by an ever growing number of Patriotic Americans who believe in the Constitution. Look at the NFL, down year over year. People who were purchasing guns and gun supplies at DKS were also purchasing from their entire line. The long term outlook for growth among existing units is negative. You add Amazon into the picture and your investment is skating on thin ICE."
Over extended.....consolidation imminent.
Freedom of speech is getting wiped out by big tech companies. Yahoo has deleted my last two post
this is a 40 stock at best.
"Good Q10 28 cents .15 divident BGFV over 8% divident In November 1997, Miller led a management effort to control the destiny of the company, raising $250 million to acquire a controlling interest in Big 5 from Leonard Green. As a result, Leonard Green's ownership position fell from 67 percent to 36.2 percent. 2001 Big 5 with a market capitalization of little more than $280 millionIn 2001, Big 5 entered a new market, Colorado, opening two stores. For the year, sales grew to nearly $622.5 million, with net income totaled almost $15 million. Management also made plans to take the company public, in the summer of 2001 filing for an initial public offering (IPO), hoping to raise as much as $115 million despite a difficult market for IPO's in recent months. Not only would Big 5 be able to relieve its debt burden, freeing up cash flow dedicated to servicing its debt and making the company less vulnerable to downturns in the economy, Leonard Green and its affiliate, Green Equity Investors, was looking to reduce its ownership position and further profit from its investment in the sporting goods chain. Big 5 enlisted Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. to underwrite the stock sale in association with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., Jefferies & Co., and Stephens Inc. With the stock market adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the offering was postponed. It was finally held in June 2002 but proved somewhat disappointing. The company had established an expected price range of $14 to $16 per share but in the end had to settle for $13, resulting in $104.65 million raised. Moreover, when the stock began trading on the NASDAQ, the price showed almost no movement on the first day. It reached a high of $13.84 before closing at $13.17, leaving Big 5 with a market capitalization of little more than $280 million What's Big Five worth today? With sales are now over a billion dollars a year"
"This is a sure-fire, gangbusters short. The CEO of the company has destroyed the company and the stock."
"After their anti-gun policies, I have bought nothing from them. I know many others who feel the same. All of our kids sport clothes and gear is now purchased elsewhere..."
down but on low volume. cp up on big volume.
yeah baby
Relief rally it will tank again.Most of what they sell came from China.The tariffs will trim their margin. IMO
take profits this wont last.....
"2nd rate store at best. Been in 3 of them, no reason to ever go back. Bass Pro, Scheel's and Cabelas are way better stores."
I should have sold my weekly puts on GME rather than this but I did not due to the earning call on GME yesterday. Who would have thought a stock with a PE ratio of 11 would go down like this in a couple of days. Now I have to sell covered calls until I recover.
"My concern is this has surged on earnings but no Sellers yet, holding for div. But on Thurs I wonder if this sells off hard. Only have to hold until after it opens Thurs then you sell and still get the 5.93 div. Shares will drop the amount of div at open and it seems like a lot of profit selling that day."
Buy buy dividends time . By Xmas time we be at 200
Am I reading this correctly? Instead of an expected loss of .09 a share they reported a 1.71 loss per share?
Hobby and recreational products are not so important if you don’t have a job. This sector of retail could be down for quite some time.
Hope you followed my advises for months on DKS. Investing is a real job and that’s my job. Patience and quality always pay off.
"Dropped -12.6%, WOW !"
Bought at $57 and I think it’s time to take some off the top
Regret DKS became overtly political. Forced me to stop buying there once they took a position hostile to my views. I had bought ammo there regularly. No more. Same store sales are down. Maybe having an effect. Principles matter and have consequences.
"Getting expelled from the NSSF which is the largest outdoor trade group is not a good sign... Having several of your larger vendors drop you is also not good.. Local to me the (DKS) sporting goods is like a ghost town, academy is fairly busy.. But Academy is selling what the people want and at a lower price from what I could tell."
After hours this will flourish to 138-140
"Sept 13 2021 #$%$s Sporting Goods is holding a National Signing Day Event! The retailer is looking to add 10,000 team members nationally. IMO, supply issues are not severe. Would they hire 10,000 workers if shelfs were empty ?"
It’s way overbought. I will short this baby today .
Time to short this POS
"Can someone please explain why this stock has gone up since earnings were announced yesterday? Not that I’m complaining as I own few shares, but I just don’t see it."
Run away!
Wow.!! Single trade of 800k shares at $135 at 2:30 today
"Is DKS even going to be profitable in 2023? :) I have never seen a sporting goods chain or electronics store not go out of business let along one that has to compete with Amazon. History always repeats itself so for new buyers on all this volume today, be very careful.Great quarter for DKS but very leary of this price point. This is the accountant in me speaking."
Fraudulent companies don't pay out special dividends at $5.50.... actually this company seems shareholder friendly... glad they didn't sell guns low profit a lot of paper work and liabilities.... 
"Used to shop here all the time and get tons of coupons, never buying from them again!"
17% of the float shorted - that was covering today - not sure why the media can’t call out a play
this premarket$6.00 drop is because of ex dividend date today.
The shorts turned Tuesday into Thursday.
How can Credit Suisse have a price target of 123 when the stock sits at 129. Most other upgrades are 150 to 175. Doesn't say much for Credit Suisse.
The role of a corporate CEO is to maximize profits and stock price not implement social change that at least half of his clientele (more at F&S) disagree with. Smart money is outta here.
"Maybe not very soon, but this, along with may other stocks will plunge, like a peregrine falcon. NO DOUBT. I am trying to earn more money outside the markets, so I can add to my shorts."
"Another price upgrade, this time by Morgan Stanley, let’s go!! 135 today!"
The way I see it a couple of our holders got together and each sold a few million shares but not before buying 1000's of buts. That is why our exec sold shares before the dividend. mho

"It's official. When the firearms industry is a little weak and they refuse to sell to a retailer, that should speak volumes about the retailer!Many gun owners happen to be finicky as it is. They would usually prefer to support a small local gun store as opposed to a big multi-national chain.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/05/10/mossberg-joins-springfield-armory-nssf-cutting-ties-dicks-sporting-goods/"
Wow stores loaded with people . Heard no discounts inventory low which means more money
"Amazing report, just incredible....Adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.01 in the latest quarter, crushing the FactSet-survey-derived analyst consensus of $1.08.Sales soared 23% to $2.41 billion from $1.96 billion. The latest figure beat the FactSet analyst consensus of $2.24 billion.Same-store sales jumped 23.2% in the latest quarter, besting the analyst consensus of 13%. Digital sales skyrocketed 95%, constituting 21% of total sales."

"@OptionTrader8- so, did you find anything out? You said you were going to talk to the CBOE? I don't trade options and curious about your claim that there will be lawsuits. Lawsuits against who? I'll tell you this. Short interest was just reported for period ending 8/31 on #$%$ Blew me away that short interest actually went up 5 days after earnings. While a temporary pull back is expected after such a strong run, if the shorts don't get out, they are going to get killed again. The average EPS for this current quarter is $1.81. #$%$ will blow that away again and raise their forecast again just like they keep doing. This company is too well run and making too much money to short it. Maybe short it next year when it gets over $175 and they are up against tough comps."
"Here's the trick hold the stock after a big pop up.. Add options strike at every dollars to attrack as many puts buyers as you can. Those feed MMs and makes it easy for them to hold the stock and push it even higher... those were added at every dollar up to $145, that exactly the strike I've written...Be sure cboe is going to add strike at every dollar above $145(instead of $5), naturally its going to help MMs to pop AND hold the stock higher... MMs are now in a squeeze mode as the short position is high on this stock, some buyback but new shorts are adding.... Could easily hit $150+ ,(as long as the market doesn't pull back)... waiting another +$5,$10 fast before thinkng of going short, probably writing call spread..."

Going to short the stock big time tomorrow morning.
shorted a thousand shares at 54.18 this is one short I'm not worried about
Love how a boycott proves the power is in the peoples hands and not their political stance.
Shorted yesterday. Got out this morning. Git 'er done!!!!
"Some of you folks here are super hung up on DKS being a retailer . I mean why should a retailer get any love these days ?Well DKS has adapted to the changing market and is thriving - it’s got great cash flow , a splendid growth rate and manageable debt at around 19% . I agree - retailing is a scary business but SOME folks do it well in their niche ( WMT & M to name a couple ). Will DKS be thriving in 10 years ? I dunno . I’d probably be more likely to bet on WalMart that far out , but for now they’ve got it going on !"

"I am downgrading it to SELL, don't see any reason it should be trading above $2"
Sell before too late
Poor company to invest in. Poor customer service and anti-gun. I'll use anyone but what the name implies
Almost no upside resistance now . Short sellers are closing positions in an orderly fashion - for now .

As an investor not in this lifetime will I buy this stock nor a fund that invests in this stock. Additionally no one in my family will ever step in a store. This company is anti constitution therefore anti America. Love this country? Then don't shop there.
"Stack said in an interview that if halting the sale certain rifles prevents one death it's worth it. Couldn't the same be said about kayak sales or selling pool toys. There are many children killed in activities like swimming and boating but you don't see them destroying kayaks. Also note the ages of some of the young people behind the gun counter selling guns. Many are not 21, why? Because they are cheap labor. Serious consistency issues with Stack."

Glad this fell today. I don’t have skin in the game here. I told myself I would never buy stock of this company after they entered the political scheme and took a hard left turn about a year ago.

Lots of sporting equipment will be needed, not only retail but for schools and businesses. Still waaaaaaay too many shorts in this and heavily underwater. Let me know when they cover."
"Best in class retailer, evolved leadership (position on guns, human resources and pricing) and potential acquisition target.... I've never seen DKS management team let a controllable variable go sideways. Full disclosure - There is none longer than me on this equity bought it at the IPO strike price. 4600% increase later I'm expecting DKS to continue to serve the share holders and I will continue to critically own this stock."
Shorting this to the low $120’s. You’ve been warned.
"My Puts aren't showing up in my account ??? But my long positions with big deduct ? When do puts ""reappear"" and what's the damage to them?"
"I don't know why there are those that want to short a company doing as well as DKS. Is it because you are short it now and wanting to talk it down and add to your position, so you don't get killed as badly? It really makes no sense. Take your losses and find a better (worse) company to short. It is true that there is a disparity in Retail right now where some have figured it out and others have not. DKS is killing it. The short squeeze is on right now! DKS management understands shareholder value better than most companies. If you short a company that just absolutely smashed earnings, raised their regular dividend and announced a special dividend of $5.50 per share, doubled their stock buyback program and raised their forecast for the rest of the year (BTW, they will beat that too and raise again next quarter!), then you really don't know what you are doing and must like losing money. Seriously."
"All this is going to do is make most hunters fisherman and outdoorsman in general who are pro 2A look else where for their supplies. Liberals may be happy but I doubt they will be flocking in to buy golf clubs and footballs just because the store wont be selling ""assault rifles""."
"Now would be a good time for the co. to start buying shares, they could save on the dividend."
Alienating a large percentage of customers is very bad business practice. I'll never shop there again.
They blamed on UA for bad ER then try to revamp underperforming brand . DKS should be under 30 already .
"No worries, this is good to $40 in short time"
Short.
Today I sold my DKS at 131. I got in at 50! My best score in a long time. Thank you DKS.
$140 here we come !
"buy low, or lower. Sell high. This sell off is about over regardless of dividends, they are baked in. .... last chance to get in below $136"
Where’s Jesse ? I’ll take all the $135 bags you’ve got lol
Never shopping here again
"I bailed out @ $35.95 this afternoon, after gift comeback."
"Gotta say I'm surprised to see there was more upside to DKS today. Congrats to those who have squeezed even more out of this stock this past week. Still think it's greedy to keep expecting more and not take profits but hey - so far it's been working. One day it'll have a really good pullback. Monday? The following week? Who knows. Anyways, considering much of the market went on a pretty good bullish run today, through to close, I'm not so sure it's anything particularly special about DKS's extended upside direction. It seems it was just alot of bullish type buying in general. As for the special dividend coming, it may not work out as well as you might think. Check out RKT after they attempted to push out the short positions by special dividend. Didn't phase things one bit. In fact the share price ended up dropping pretty bad despite a raging+ home/mortgage situation we've had this year. DKS is now in the analyst new ranges and one bad market day + profit-taking could send this back 5-10% fairly easy."
I'll find somewhere else to shop thank you! Stay away from Political compares. The majority of people in the USA support the 2nd
Plenty of parking in front of DKS.
