"Interesting spot, going to pick some up. Great company, fantastic earnings, price targets of $145+"
"Not a great trade stock with the low volune but a good long play. Also kind of singled out in its sector, many other similar retail stores are privately owned(Cabela, Bass Pro, REI). Also, very small debt…"
Was the recent special dividend previously announced?
If had money buy it today end of the day and ride it back to 145
People should pick this stock its gonna rise because of sport season.
"Best in class retailer, evolved leadership (position on guns, human resources and pricing) and potential acquisition target.... I've never seen DKS management team let a controllable variable go sideways. Full disclosure - There is none longer than me on this equity bought it at the IPO strike price. 4600% increase later I'm expecting DKS to continue to serve the share holders and I will continue to critically own this stock."
This will be a wise investment
I love when my dks keeps rising...
"Earnings summary: $1.0B in rev, 40% growth YOY, EPS of $2.57, 77.2% growth YOY. These are absolutely staggering numbers. I guess one could consider this growth temporary as the RV boom wanes, but I highly doubt that is the case for a couple reasons: A) there is a cohort of boomers who are retiring, some retiring early, to enjoy life and travel, but don't want to fly or cruise with Covid-19 still around, so are buying RVs to see the country (like my parents). B) young families (like mine) are camping and RVing as the new normal trip, vacation or long weekend C) people who live on lakes or on the coast are never going to stop buying boats, whether Chris Craft or Barletta. You could say the same about $BC as a cheap, wise investment right now.Furthermore, as I said earlier, Winnebago is eating Thor's lunch. Literally taking market share with better quality products, better business decisions and better finances. While $THO was issuing new notes to raise capital, $WGO was boosting dividend by 50% and approving $200M buyback. I mean, if that's not financial strength, I'm not sure what is.This takes our current PE to 8.46 and our future PE to 7.27 assuming 25% growth next quarter. Every quarter we set new records while the stock treads water because people are too busy chasing unprofitable technology to the moon.I've said this before. We've suffered various downgrades on the great outdoors and related products. I think these are way overdue for a huge rally when people realize these activities and sports are here to stay. $ASO $DKS $PII $HMC $VSTO $BC $WGO $THO $CWH $LCII"
"I wouldn't be surprised to see a nice gap down coming in the coming days.... well, not that I need it.... but usually, cboe do NOT halt stock options trading like this....."
Clothing prices so expensive no matter what store you buy . This stock going hit 160 by Xmas
Thank You for the great dividends
"Nike cuts forecast will impact DKS , there’s too much expectation here any snafu we could see 20% hair cut . IMO"
Not much to complain about with the special whopping dividend payout today!!
Yes it’s down today - perhaps in sympathy with a big Dow drop we’ll over 200 points - but it DID hit a new all time high today at one point despite the tepid close .
we not sure of what we have no proof of. but if people short or sell that's legal and part of the game If the suits secretly bought thousands of shares and we benefited we wouldn't complain. Bottom line this stock will be huge in the next few weeks. I've seen this same sell off many times with huge companies and they all came back and surpassed the losses. really no worries. 
Sorry I am a new buyer of DKS. Not sure how this special dividend affects's today's price and see no news on it. I am losing big as I bought past week. Should I sell as this price drop is extreme unless a good reason for it like a special dividend. Thank you for any advise.
"buying more dks with the dividends . looking good for Christmas sales, dip in price. Seems like dks is super shareholder friendly. "
Dks is a strong company that will no doubt double its market cap in the next year
"Longs, be VERY careful here, $132 and cboe halted options trading o the stock..... It has something really bad going on..."
