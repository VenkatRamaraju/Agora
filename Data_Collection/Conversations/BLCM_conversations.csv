Earnings Nov 3....if negative figures...over and out I presume.
"BLCM is perfect for the meme crowd at Reddit. New source of revenue, only 7m shares, no debt, cash and a potential short squeeze. Load up memes."
"I return since the pandemic first caused waves those years ago in feb and I see this stock has gotten worse. I remember the reverse stock split they used to artificially pump up the price to keep their listing on the NASDAQ and knew right then and there that this company is #$%$ Now I log on to see the price under $2(I remember when the paid shills were hyping this as a $10 stock) and de-listed. If I had the capital, I would short this company into oblivion. The fact that people still hold this stock and then are screeching quarter after quarter about its price decrease is sad. I tell you as someone who smelled the dung early on to get out. You are better off getting lotto tickets or burying your dollars in literal dirt than investing in this company."
Volume is all its going to take to light this fuse
"The real issue that I see here, other than the fact that this is still highly speculative, is that they are going to need to do another capital raise sometime in the first or second quarter of next year. Given that the shares are already so cheap, and that the market cap is so low; I think a lot of people are sitting on the sidelines to avoid getting burned. I really don't know though, and I am open to any different and/or opposing opinions. I am otherwise very curious about this company; but I remain cautious."
"I just researched Bellicum Pharma Europe on Bellicum's website and on LinkedIn. They hired their European GM (Thierry Darcis) in August 2018, an HR person in Sept 2018, an IT specialist in Oct, a Distribution and Customer Service person in Nov, a Projects and Launch Excellence person in Jan 2019, and a Medical Affairs expert in April 2019. They don't seem to have hired a sales team yet (at least based on LinkedIn profiles), but it would seem they remain on track for filing for EU regulatory approval in 2H 2019.And yes, this is me justifying my additional investment in BLCM over the last couple of days. Fingers crossed for ASCO and beyond."
"From the earnings call when the CEO said, ""The ASH presentation offered three important takeaways; first, the six months event free survival or EFS in Rivo-cel treated patients is trending ahead of EFS in patients undergoing matched unrelated donor or MUD transplantation. As a reminder, noninferiority on the EFS versus MUD transplant is our agreed-upon primary endpoint for European regulatory review.Second, the data provided further evidence of the durability of efficacy of rivo-cel, with high rates of relapse free and overall survival, with a median follow-up of almost 2 years.Lastly, the results demonstrated the efficacy of CaspaCIDe, as 70% of patients that developed advanced or steroid refractory GvHD, responded when retreated with rimiducid, a majority of which were complete responses. We expect topline results from this study in the second quarter and intend to submit European marketing authorization applications for rivo-cel and rimiducid in late 2019."""
"I believe the out-license to industry partners , as mentioned in the UNC and Mass General PR, will be soon, significant, and transformational for BLCM and CAR-T applications"
Down on no news...
"I feel as though there will be a capital raise at some point soon. The hope is that it will be after good news is released, causing a substantial rise in share price before dilutive financing commences; otherwise, we may see this go quite a bit lower before things get better. Alternatively, there is good news, followed by a buyout. I like this company; but the complete silence from investors and the company alike has me feeling a bit discouraged. Maybe this will be a sleeper that suddenly spikes on good news since it is so thinly traded as of late. Who knows. Wishing all shareholders good luck!"
"Before yesterday's trading started , I believed we could have a good up day because of the expected content of the poster presentation.IP on pancreatic cancer is potentially very valuable.My suspicion was confirmed with the high volume and up side move, 30 percent.However, the significant news to me was the positive market reaction to a BLCM PR.That shows a change in sentiment.Recent positive PRs did not help. Some word has gotten out. The Bakers nor the Boxers nor the other institutes would have invested many more millions if not for the lure of significant return. Their Due Diligence must have been very convincing.I am of the opinion that BLCM has great technology for a huge unmet application .I also believe like our analysts do that the potential for much higher PPS exists."
"it's torture!!! lolI hate it more when it loses ground before the weekend.And, Florida will probably kill LSU.My life temporarily sucks. ha ha haI wish BLCM would wake up from this deep sleep and give us some great news.I've given up on LSU this year."
"My view of BLCM is that it is extremely high risk until we see something different, like a move to the upside based on solid news.That may not happen, but, being an optimist and an avid reader of all I can read about this, I believe that turn will be any day.Nonetheless, I could be totally wrong.It seems to me that MDAnderson, Mass General, and UNC will be selling our technology ( out licensing ) to their very large networks .This unique technology seems to work in the field of cancer and CarT applications , which are extremely expensive areas and unmet needs.I'm sure I'm not expressing this in the best manner.These institutions would not have made deals with BLCM if they did not see significant use for the IP and related offerings.I have averaged down, am underwater to the tune of a whole lot of money , but still have high hopes as a shareholder from this point . Very high risk, potentially rewarding."
"Update on BPX-603 expected in Q4. If there's positive news, this could really run. If not, well, we've already seen what it can do in the other direction."
"I might be missing something, but this seems really oversold to me, so I added 30K to my position between 2.95 and 3. My average cost is still a touch above $5, so this was me averaging down. The supply agreement with Miltenyi Biotec earlier this month seemed like a clear positive signal to me. They wouldn't agree to pay 2 million euros upfront and minimum annual purchases if they weren't expecting regulatory approval. That's obviously not a guarantee, but it does signal that the company currently believes they'll get approval. I'm holding for the long term, so I view the current price as a buying opportunity. GLTA."
"Blcm should be on the up as I can’t see how it’s doing nothing more than nose diving day after day. I lost a bit when it diluted last time so it at the point of a difficult decision. A, Get rid and cut your loses. B, Buy on the low and hold in the hope of great expectations."
"I have no expertise in this field whatsoever. That being confessed, I did a search on Dr. Rezvani at MDA.I did this today after reading the Sept 1 PR from BLCM regarding the additional expansion with MDA.She is quite impressive in my view. The above mentioned PR is also impressive. I reread it a couple of times to understand it better.I will not be surprised, after reading about Dr Rezvani and Takeda Pharma, that BLCM may get involved with Takeda.I'm scared to death because I realize the high risk, but I am also excited about possibilities over the next few weeks and months and beyond. BLCM technology has huge potential for cancer patients. The current PPS is like buying shares substantially below venture capital input. It reflects current risk I guess. But, there may be incredible reward if BLCM survives and becomes more successful.I'm not making any recommendations to buy. I am nonetheless very hopeful.Good luck to all longs and patients."
"considering the recent license agreements with MDA, UNC, and Mass General, it seems to me there is apparently valuable IP agreed upon by multiple impressive cancer centers whose influence is a large audience of other cancer centers.Rivocel still may have value.With a clinical update due this quarter on BP603 ???, and the market cap being so tiny on BLCM, it seems tom"
I fold. This has been the most painful experience for me... :-(GL to remaining longs.
"You are hurting,!! I have over $50K in this stock, I have ridden it down from $20. a share to $2.51 a share after the Spit. I haven't looked at my financial statement, probably worth less than $1K."
