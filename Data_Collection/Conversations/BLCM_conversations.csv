"I think the most reasonable explanation for the price action boils down to their cash position. They'll probably have ~50m at the end of Q2, and that's only gonna last till EOY at this rate. I think a dilution at these prices would be disastrous, especially looking at the SP last year. Worries about this dilution might be causing a cycle of selling. Now, they said that they are looking for a partner for Rivocel, and a good upfront payment would really help, in addition to any milestone payments and royalties for the future. My worry is that because of their poor cash position, they aren't in a particularly good negotiating position since it's clear they are desperate for some sort of financial relief. They need the partner more than any partner needs them, since it seems that the survival of the company rests on finding a partner. So unless there are multiple potential partners currently vying for it (which might be possible given the more lucrative adult population currently in ph2/3 studies that would probably be tied into the agreement) it doesn't seem like they have much leverage in negotiations. So if they're stuck trying to raise cash another way, they are left with debt or dilution, both of which would be difficult at these levels. Debt is obviously more risky given their size, and I don't I doubt they will be able to find any sort of reasonable or attractive terms. So yeah, I think they're in a pretty big bind financially. As for the possibility of an acquisition, I'm not sure management would accept anything around the levels they are at right now. Like, even if someone offered then 4x their market cap, that would only be 300m, which is far smaller than what they projected potential revenues could be for Rivocel in pediatrics alone."
What kind of news are we expecting and on what day.... thanks... a little new to this stock!
"Normally I do not have much trust in pre market action.I hope today is going to be different.it would speak loudly to my optimism if we have a nice increase today .Premarket so far today we are bidding up some and seemingly steady.it makes me feel as if the recent increase in volume may also be a factor today.Therefore, it also makes me feel the presence of some big hedge or other institutes are quite optimistic about some positive event coming soon."
"here's my prediction for ships and gigglesIt is my opinion that extremely little stock is for sale. Most float is owned by Baker's, Boxers, and hedgies.none are selling.if the quarterly report points to survival, possibly some MDA revenue, some clinical encouraging comments, this stock is going to start a parabolic rise.This is my hope."
CAR-T cells clinical trail are all failing. Only last maybe 3 months with stable condition then the tumor starts to grow because the engineered cells die off. It's a big disappointment.
"This sale of stock was needed for operating expenses. It is a very good company, the future is strone, do not sell your stock. I see this at $16 a share by 08/2018. I hold 12,500 shares and options on 5,000 more."

The stock should be above $16.
"Definitely doesn't feel good that Rivocel data is coming out down to the wire. They said it would be out by Q2, so that only leaves until tomorrow. And Friday PRs are generally thought to be the time for negative news, but the CEO continued to be reassuring and confident in a positive readout in his presentation to Jefferies earlier this month."

"@Paddy lolthank youSome people have no idea I was kidding. Here's a true story.I have so much in BLCM that I have no cash available on my debit card and only $13 left on my credit card limit.I was in Tampa yesterday at my getaway cottage , very modest.Very little gas to make it home about 1,1/2 hours away.Thank God my job pays me tomorrow. lol"
"Today BLCM Announced Data Presentations on Lead Product Candidate Rivo-cel and Controllable CAR Program at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting Dec 1, 2 and 3. My opinion this is all good news or it would not be offered as a presentation. Time to buy a lot of it before the big guys drive it up. I see it in 2 years above $30"
People are worried about this reverse split but it is done to preserve the stocks value not harm the shareholder. A higher price is better in that it does not exclude entities that will not buy under certain cash values. The share price is adjusted in proportion to the increase in shares to maintain equal value. Nothing really changes other than the price appears higher.
"My buy order at $1.20 remains unfilled, but I did go ahead and add some shares at current levels, just because I think BLCM is holding up nicely despite a recent run-up as well as world/market turmoil, and I THINK/HOPE that bodes well for our prospects going forward. Here's hoping 2020 is a fantastic year for all Longs, particularly those of us who've been invested a couple of years, and have stuck with BLCM. I've been in this stock a while, so unfortunately my cost basis remains over $3 even with the recent buying. Fingers crossed that it will prove to be a good long-term investment."
This stock had momentum before the reverse split was enacted.In my opinionIncreasing the price of the shares by reducing the number of outstanding sharesMade BLCM look desperate. Reverse splits send a message thatManagement fears more of a drop in share price than a hope that more fundsWill buy it.I am hoping they did not shoot themselves in the foot on this one.
What in the world is going on here? Has to be some news coming right? Otherwise we never have this kind of volume in BLCM...
"BLCM is perfect for the meme crowd at Reddit. New source of revenue, only 7m shares, no debt, cash and a potential short squeeze. Load up memes."
here is what we demand todayan increase in volumea nice increase in PPSno significant retrace in the afternoonContinued bias towards positive news coming soon
@Quo You are not well informed. The first product - European pediatric opportunity clinically de-risked 249 patients enrolled in Phase 1 / 2 study Late interim results presented at ASH in Dec. 2018
possible leakToo much good stuff going on to hidePancreatic cancer progress simply too monumental to surpress
This past week we had the market all over the place and a middle east blow up. BLCM went up with all world events last week. My take on this is all the big traders know this isundervalued and they know there is good news forthcoming. short term price target is 5 in my book. I have been following this stock from day one. It is only a mater of time till we see double digits. My long term price projection is $27.50
I think some hedge fund is accumulating BLCM shares by making a surprise market order sweeps.
News - finally - great news .
I've owned this stock for over 6 years. a couple years ago they reported they were filing an NDA. Now there is no talk about that. It appears all their programs are in Stages 1/11. What happened?
"Why does this share only has selling pressure? What do these guys have to show to get momentum? Their cost structure is significantly improved, they have a healthy portfolio of investors, they have promising results from the trials, they have money till into 2021, when much more info is available from further trial results, By that time they have licensed out or sold Rivocel, they might become real target for one for he big boys strategic partners. What is going on?"
"Is this the stock with the lowest market cap owned by the Baker Brothers?The latest report as of 3-16-2021 shows no change in their BLCM holdings and shows them owning 249,123 shares which is about 4% ownership."
For those that think this has gone up too much to still get in they should realize that the MC is still minuscule relative to the potential here. I’m still buying mostly because of the valuation. The momentum isn’t bad either though.
"I might be missing something, but this seems really oversold to me, so I added 30K to my position between 2.95 and 3. My average cost is still a touch above $5, so this was me averaging down. The supply agreement with Miltenyi Biotec earlier this month seemed like a clear positive signal to me. They wouldn't agree to pay 2 million euros upfront and minimum annual purchases if they weren't expecting regulatory approval. That's obviously not a guarantee, but it does signal that the company currently believes they'll get approval. I'm holding for the long term, so I view the current price as a buying opportunity. GLTA."
"Not a bad grind higher today. Volume is pretty low, so it probably doesn't mean anything. But who knows, maybe perception of our potential is changing."
"Since Ive worked on Walstreet for years and know exactly how the game is played, let me enlighten you guys what happens. When a long-term chart has bottomed and retested & the set-up is right, the big trading houses know the direction of the stock will trend so to help it along, they place large buy/sell orders at specific prices in order to get the retail investor to jump in. The trick is to know where the resistance levels are set & place your orders."
nothing is happening. people are making money shorting the indexes as well as individual biotechs which is a double whammy. My price target is still 32.50!
Red or Green today we will see how it is going today........Suspect to see 1.30 today
Volume is all its going to take to light this fuse
"Here's what I think. Let us not be overly preoccupied with the short term. BLCM's technology has potential to lap over into many other CAR-T type solutions. Casp and Rimicuid are management solutions that ca alleviate the negative effects of CAR-T, then Stimulate T cells for a 'second' dosage so to speak. When I read the various biotechs out there, it is clear that there are many who are dealing CAR-T type treatments. The potential negative effect of the CAR-T is cutokine release which can be deadly, and neurological impairment."
"it seems to me we just closed two days in a row , up nicely,each day, and near the high,of each day.We have bounced quickly from an intraday low of $3.04 to Now $4.09Although there is speculation regarding ADAP , we have no real information nor a Press Release.Because of the increase volume and price, I believe there may be a partial,leak or rumor of something good coming.We may start to see momentum players and day traders come in,here.If we can go up near a dollar over the last few days with no PR, and in consideration of our OS and float , just think where we could go if cash comes in and or "" the right"" partner or collaboration.I'll do wild speculation. Over $10 is not impossible.Game changer for many of us.Domino effect for me, in a good way."
"I looked at Bellicum's European regulatory approval and commercialization team again, and it looks like they have 10 people in the UK that are on LinkedIn - 4 under the corporate profile and 6 under Bellicum Pharma Limited. They started in Sept 2018 with the HR person, and the other nine were hired 8-9 months ago. They certainly seem to have the basics in place, and none of them has jumped ship. Fingers crossed that they know what they're doing. I've been buying BLCM on the way down, and am far underwater at this time, but I added a bit more today at $1.35. I'm counting on them finding a strategic partner and rising from here. They certainly seem to have solid IP, and given all the pharma M&A activity, they SHOULD have suitors. GLTA."
5.50 tomorrow
This data could help tremendously to find a partner which would move the stock!
"I believe the out-license to industry partners , as mentioned in the UNC and Mass General PR, will be soon, significant, and transformational for BLCM and CAR-T applications"
"my thoughts and pure speculation1. we seem to have moved from .80 to bouncing above the dollar mark2. MDA press release is a positive3. hedge funds staying is a positive4 Baker Brothers, Boxer Investment are positive5. Possible partner on Rivocel, Mfg Facility , 6. Possible clinical progress7 . creeping up on higher lately volumeI believe very possible over the next week to 30 days or so to have a major move up.Even a buyout above $5 is not impossibleAt 5 our market cap is still pitifully low but I would have much to celebrate Good luck.all longs"
"I have no expertise in this field whatsoever. That being confessed, I did a search on Dr. Rezvani at MDA.I did this today after reading the Sept 1 PR from BLCM regarding the additional expansion with MDA.She is quite impressive in my view. The above mentioned PR is also impressive. I reread it a couple of times to understand it better.I will not be surprised, after reading about Dr Rezvani and Takeda Pharma, that BLCM may get involved with Takeda.I'm scared to death because I realize the high risk, but I am also excited about possibilities over the next few weeks and months and beyond. BLCM technology has huge potential for cancer patients. The current PPS is like buying shares substantially below venture capital input. It reflects current risk I guess. But, there may be incredible reward if BLCM survives and becomes more successful.I'm not making any recommendations to buy. I am nonetheless very hopeful.Good luck to all longs and patients."
"Not a whole lot of substance here or elsewhere on this company. Mostly people rehashing balance sheet ratios and earnings expectations, which matter less now than after approval, if they get it. Cash burn of course matters. Still, I haven't seen a publicly distributed model of the potential this company possesses given the clinical trial stats, market size of the target conditions in the potential markets and analysis of the competition. Novartis, Gilead and Celgene all have taken a leap on Car-T, but each of their respective products carry insane side effects with high likelihood of issues with efficacy potentially less than that of BLCM- who can actually modulate the treatment directly in case of potential issue. People can hate on BLCM all they want, but most of the people hating don't understand the complexities of these products to the point where they could differentiate a transformative product from a product likely to be unsuccessful. The price movement of this company has been driven by the secondary offering and technicals, but the fundamentals will drive this company over the long-term. I asked myself after reviewing the clinical trial data and information on similar Car-t products, if I had to put myself or my child on one of these treatments, which would I feel better with? The answer is I would feel much better with BLCM's bpx-501 than the other products currently on the market (search Novartis car-t and Gilead/Kite car-t) IMHO."
"I am taking this week off from business so I have free time to post again. So please forgive me on this quiet board.I think loyal longs should be very encouraged today.I follow about 60 stocks fairly closely. Mostly biotech.Every one was red today on what was a very bad day for the markets.I only own one stock. Zero market diversification. I have diversification away from the market.Despite very low volume today, with the backdrop of bad markets, there was extremely little selling.As I have speculated, it seems most want to hold on to the few shares of this low float company.I sense on speculation that some deal is coming soon. Possibly good data. Possibly FDA activity.Even possible buyout .I remain very optimistic but allow for being totally wrong.The trading says otherwise.The smart companies invested in BLCM say otherwise.Best of luck to all smart longs here.I'm just average."
We seem to be moving away from the average target price of $4.90I want to see $6.00 this year; can we get it done!
Trials going slower than anticipated and they are spending way too much. At this pace they need at least $120 million a years so they will need to raise more money after 6 months. I believe in their prospects but at the pace which they are moving they need a lot of time.
This remind me of a stock called Mederex back in 2007. The stock had a bunch of failures and the stock had gone from 20 range down to 4. Out of the blue Bristol bought them for 20 a share. The end happened overnight!
shorts playing with fire...not much downside from here rather the opposite.. could easily double or triple
"How soon are we looking at any kind of significant news on the companies drug development. Also, where do the Baker Bros. stand with this stock? Appreciate any responses."
anyone excited like me. I believe we are in an uptrend and will soon have excellent news.$3.80 will seem like a giveaway .
"From the earnings call when the CEO said, ""The ASH presentation offered three important takeaways; first, the six months event free survival or EFS in Rivo-cel treated patients is trending ahead of EFS in patients undergoing matched unrelated donor or MUD transplantation. As a reminder, noninferiority on the EFS versus MUD transplant is our agreed-upon primary endpoint for European regulatory review.Second, the data provided further evidence of the durability of efficacy of rivo-cel, with high rates of relapse free and overall survival, with a median follow-up of almost 2 years.Lastly, the results demonstrated the efficacy of CaspaCIDe, as 70% of patients that developed advanced or steroid refractory GvHD, responded when retreated with rimiducid, a majority of which were complete responses. We expect topline results from this study in the second quarter and intend to submit European marketing authorization applications for rivo-cel and rimiducid in late 2019."""
"I just researched Bellicum Pharma Europe on Bellicum's website and on LinkedIn. They hired their European GM (Thierry Darcis) in August 2018, an HR person in Sept 2018, an IT specialist in Oct, a Distribution and Customer Service person in Nov, a Projects and Launch Excellence person in Jan 2019, and a Medical Affairs expert in April 2019. They don't seem to have hired a sales team yet (at least based on LinkedIn profiles), but it would seem they remain on track for filing for EU regulatory approval in 2H 2019.And yes, this is me justifying my additional investment in BLCM over the last couple of days. Fingers crossed for ASCO and beyond."
"CC was good. Insightful questions from the analysts. Management with coherent responses to them all. I was not aware of the Zalmoxis product. They claim to have a better wheel, but the populations are similar and the product apparently has struggled. They seem to have a game plan for solid tumors. Just too soon to say if it will be successful. Cash burn wasn't mentioned on the call but end 2109 is around the corner and company will have to raise cash well in advance of need. I don't know what partnership potential there really is, so share offering seems pretty likely, pretty soon. But with biotechs that's not necessarily a kiss of death. Not good, either, obviously."
Baker Bros have a habit of buying into companies that eventually get bought out. Looking for $10.00 plus buyout. Partnership lingering with completed phase 3 and 112 million in the bank worth that all day long. Good time to get in on ground level here.imho
it would be better than sweet to see positive comments at the Conference today push this PPS over $6 today or tomorrow
"it's not just the $5 million upfront and the royaltiesit's also the vindication and confirmation of the product , the technology and BLC M as a viable and growing company"
one quarter million shares traded in first 12 minutesup .08 near 7 percentI suggest something positive is brewing
Now is the time to buy BLCM before the results in the presentation the latest results.
it is 1050 ambarely over an hour of trading on Christmas Eve and over 300k shares alreadyIs this a Santa Claus rally for BLCM?This is supposed to be a very dlow day.We are up 8 percent on very good volume considering the day..Will the manipulators who are loading their boats take the PPS down again?I hope not and think not.Something good is brewing.I'm excited and want to share that with longs.Keep the Faith.Merry Christmas.This is going to be great ( in my opinion but I have done my DD)
I held a small position- may or may not regret it- we'll see! I haven't seen a $1+ RS before.
"""Bellicum to participate in two upcoming virtual investor conferences""... and the stock tanks by almost 20%. Investors clearly love this stock... :(I'm a long-term holder - I like the differentiation of their technology, and the blue-chip healthcare institutions they're affiliated with - but I have to say that this has been really painful to see. Let's hope they get strong trial results in Q4 and this thing turns around."
"Don't forget ,1 year ago the share price 3,50$, 2yrs ago 9,42$, 3 yrs ago 14,50$, 4 yrs ago 20.0$...still a long way to go...but after the recent moves I am hopefull for the future of BLCM."
"What if...?The partnership talks reg. Rivo-Cel end up in a straight forward acquisition of the whole co.?Why is that possible?Because at this price we are talking about little money.To negotiate a partnership for Rivo-Cel it takes time, lawyers, talks about milestones/manufacturing/distribution/royalties/controlling etc. For an upfront payment of -lets say - 50M (little money for the likes of Roche, GILD, BMY, MRK...) thats little money for a lot of hazzle...Why not ask: ""Besides of rivo what else do you have? Show me what you have!""BPX-601 (vvery high unmet need very promising results, next readouts around the corner)603 (HER2 - hot topic)802 (ready to file IND)recently securred financing (puts co in a better neg.-pos.)...So we have rivo - a completely de-risked asset, ready to go to market - and as you can see above SO MUCH MORE.So while doing the due diligence for a rivo-partnership why not say ""Let´s scoop up the WHOLE company with ALL CANDIDATES for $X!""Is a deal IMMINENT?Somebody knows something..."
"With OTS Go-CAR-NK program using MHC-I, this company has cutting edge tech. If their NK program works at all, this will get bought by a big pharma wanting into the CAR space for solid tumor. Even before that, the 601 and 603 programs look like solid advances on CAR-T tech. They have cash to go for a long while, especially with reduction in opex from the sale and assets and people."
This stock has been dead money for so long it's easy to overlook the fact that the company is putting together a meaningful platform of therapies. Not that that's a guarantee of anything.
There are three companies that are interested. The price asked is about $60. The price they may get is about $45.
Bought another 13300 shares. Sad to say but cost basis only down to $3.54
"Administration of BPX-601 followed by single-dose rimiducid was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities- Frequent AEs were generally consistent with those experienced by advanced cancer patients undergoing cytotoxicchemotherapy or other cancer immunotherapies- The majority of AEs related to BPX-601/rimiducid were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved with or withoutsupportive care• Compared with a single dose of Cy alone, more intense lymphodepletion with Flu/Cy is associated with elevations ofIL-7 and IL-15 and significantly increased BPX-601 expansion and prolonged persistence in patients treated withsingle-dose rimiducid• Evidence of biological activity/stable disease has been observed in heavily pre-treated pancreatic cancer patients• Evaluation of safety and efficacy of BPX-601 followed by repeat-dose rimiducid is planned• Collection of pre- and on-treatment biopsies were added to the study in a recent protocol amendment; tissue analysisresults will be presented at a later date"
"Why is this going down so fast, especially since BLCM is working on an OTS Go-CAR-NK program using MHC-I. Recent literature on the MHC-I showed ""screening to establish that a T-cell receptor (TCR) recognized and killed most human cancer types via the monomorphic MHC class I-related protein..."""
The Baker Brothers own 6.6% of BLCM. Let that sink in for a moment. Don't sell.
I just dont get it with Bellicum. The company has some real gems in hand with Rivocel and BPX601. Does the market not believe it or are there funding worries? Rivicel is ready for EMAA application
I have a lot of faith in this stock. It should surpass 15 once they clear the fda hold .
A solid day to begin the year. Thank goodness.
"a small knee-jerk reaction is normal and understandable.This company is now better positioned for success going forward.I see better cash position, careful share management, better expense management, better targeted allocation of resources, superior technology for significant unmet needs, etc etc.There is no denial of many negatives but there is also no denial of many positives, and more now than shortly ago.Great potential risk/ reward scenario.Baker Bros, Boxer, and many others see exceptional opportunity."
sweet recovery today after getting zapped with a larger sale down to $3.24Nice close in my opinion.
I'm of the opinion that despite the fda's halt the unique position Belgium has over the rest of the marketplace is in fact it's switch to turn it off with any high risk therapy there are side effects and they have to address them accordingly. belsham Pharmaceuticals has a great opportunity to show that there switch does what it's supposed to do which is why it's Superior in the first place. The efficacy although the data is preliminary speaks for itself. it's not hard to be down on initial investment if you're in it today that said I believe long-term belcim will provide a wonderful return.
nice price target update today
Bluebird Bio results may renew focus on the space. Then new 501 data in 2 weeks. Stars may be aligned for a nice move in BLCM shares.
"I thought there was a positive change in language at the last investor presentation. CEO was saying they are in active partnership discussions vs. before I believe they limited their comments to ""seeking a commercial partner"". He also said they were looking for a global partner that would take over Rivocel commercialization and development in Eu and US (which would include the current ph.3 trial). I think this combined with current EU pediatric approvability should be an interesting and valuable package."
Rivo Cel Data in the next couple of weeks as stated in their presentation. This is key data that will either get them partnered or even bought out. Big accumulation today after presentation.$7 PT conservative price target too. Wells Fargo PT is $22
Tiny volume 624 shares. But you have to give it to the short sellers. Can't see how this this will recover.
Bloomberg billionaires bought BLCM stocks $2.5 million worth of share. Buy now before go to moon
Somebody knows something...
Reason for climb today 13 G filing showing Boxer Asset Management now owns 10% of BLCM.
Over sold
"anybody optimistic like me for the next week as well as beyond?Anemic volume lately but at least up,a little Last Thursday and Friday.It seems to me that some news is due soon.We just went above the 50 DMAI am optimistic news will,bump,us above the 200 DMAif so, I would be on cloud 9 feeling that was just a start to better days"
Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD:NASDAQ) should buy it ASAP (say $37 per share) for a good fit with its KITE division. BLCM price should be about $60 per share by November 2019..

"$400m prospectus filed with the SEC: $400,000,000Common StockPreferred StockDebt SecuritiesWarrants From time to time, we may offer up to $400,000,000 of any combination of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. We may also offer securities as may be issuable upon conversion, redemption, repurchase, exchange or exercise of any securities registered hereunder, including any applicable antidilution provisions.Hopefully, and I'm assuming, they are looking towards the non-dilutive methods for now, since with looming partnership/NDA filling/launch they are probably expecting the sp to go up from these dismal levels. I'd be interested to know, since I'm not entirely familiar with these sort of things, how they come up with the number of 400m. Are they allowed to just choose any number they want? Because they are only at ~70m MC with ~50m in cash, so they certainly couldn't raise close to 400m right now. So, I'm assuming they are just future-proofing themselves so they don't have to refile this type of thing later."
I feel like a few semi-deep pockets are manipulating this stock. If I never post again you'll know I was right.
I'm starting to think partnership or buyout is coming. Something is going to sling us back over $10 very soon and I think everyone can feel it
Still waiting for it to hit 3
Adding 5MM in cash and the market cap goes up 2MM. Crazy
"Bought 20,000 shares today. Easily going back to $12 on any positive clinical trial updates"
I thought the news was good.
I just found this stock. the chart looks like it can have some upside to upper $4 range short term. also looks like it could break the 200 SMA and start trending up longer term.
I'm so embarrassed here that no one knows to read stock charts. This stock is headed to the $4 range by this summer. Maybe sooner.
Make December to Remember What a day........
"Term of the dilution should have been told, otherwise the stock will be in a free fall..."
"Well, I decided to add 20% to my position yesterday and today. If the recent drop is due to leaked bad news, then I'm obviously in trouble. However, since I didn't see any change from my prior investment thesis, I decided to up my investment a bit. Here's hoping for good news at ASCO and beyond..."
"Insiders have scooped up 60,000+ shares within the last few months. They did it in well in advance of Nov CC so as not to raise any suspicion regarding the gain they will have once this thing bumps up in November. Get ready for the ride."
This should be trading much higher....market cap should be around $250million. For the products they have in pipeline . Just hold the stock until people figure it out.
I’m tempted to just keep adding each day while the market cap is so low.
"Wow,look at the options the company enrich its management. I will never invest in the company again"

"Seems to me that BLCM science is valued somewhat by an impressive list of organizations.Baker Brothers, Boxer Capital, 6 hedge funds in total???, MDAnderson, etc.The reverse split has a possibility of working now in my opinion if the company succeeds in the clinic and if they can finally partner somehow here or in Europe.I see this going to zero or being an incredible buy with only the low count of outstanding shares now.I have rebought all I can buy with every penny I have. I held off until.now.I think we will go up to $10 to $15 over the next few weeks or months.The sky could be the upper limit.Good luck to all longs here."
"I think their plan is to dilute after data comes out and the sp rises. They're definitely running out of cash, and I think it shows their confidence in a positive readout that they didn't dilute before the data came out. If they thought there was a reasonable chance for a negative readout, I think they would have diluted earlier, since they're making a pretty big gamble on being able to fund the company. Dilution at these levels or, worse, with a negative readout, would be pretty catastrophic."

Merry Xmas everyone Can't believe it closed at 1.14Normaly it goes up and end of day it goes down but not today..... .
"I don't understand what investors are expecting from BLCM. Its timeline hasn't changed, its technology is still rock solid, the potential remains, yet the share price is collapsing. Everybody knew that it wouldn't be the first or second CAR-T product approved but the indication for BLCM's will be unique, as is the technology. It's really disheartening to hold this and watch it continually sink."
"I really like our trading pattern today.I feared more selling as Awesome guessed, but so far, I do not see it.it seems the opposite.Possibly a reversal from the profit taking and consolidation from days of an uptrend.My believe is that clinical data will be good, clinicians have been warned as of yesterday with the SEC filing , and we could trend up slowly on expectancy, and then boom!!!my guess/ my hope"
"BLCM's recent 10-Q (filed August 5th) makes for sobering reading, as it details the liquidity risk facing the company. That said, there was one thing in it that was mildly intriguing, to those inclined to clutch at straws. ""The Company entered into a lease agreement for office space and equipment in South San Francisco, California commencing in April 2019 and expiring in2022."" If you look on their website, this office space is at 611 Gateway Blvd in South San Francisco. That address is smack-dab in the middle of Genentech's campus, and I'm almost certain that specific building has a Genentech presence as well. Pure coincidence? Maybe. But to long-suffering longs like myself, any little crumb can mean hope."
Just bought more today @2.04Waiting for the poster presentation 01/24/20Good luck all
"Well, I really like the price action here they tried to bring her down pre market, Then let the day trader/ momo overhang out at 1.03. Now good vol and we are green.We start to behave like a real Stock.It seems people finally get the amazing fundamentales this Co has..."
sky is definitely falling..... on bellicom
How many shares does Bakers Bros Own?
Baker brother moving up there lower tier stock early in the year
Trading is halted today.it is not because there is BLCM news.it's because there are so many buy orders that market makers are trying to use calculus to compute how much over
"lets talk about why we are invested in BLCM, what is the next milestone the world is awaiting from these guys and the timeframe. What new key piece of information are we awaiting - 3 months out, 6 months or less? Please advise"
Why did I buy at 9? ohhh why!
is anyone know the why it drop so much today? thanks
"I wonder what - if anything - is going on. The overall market is not up enough in the last two days to justify BLCM being up 30-35%. Granted that's off a ridiculously small base, but at a minimum, someone's accumulating. At this point, I'll take the slightest semblance of positive movement. Here's hoping Q3 is when the patience finally pays off in a big way for long-term holders like myself..."
"Who did they hire and give 15,000 stock options to? I wish they'd just hire an investment banker and try to sell the company for whatever they can get. Don't know why we're still burning through money at this point..."
I just unloaded my entire holdings. Lesson of a lifetime...
"i've lost so much, I'm in til the end"
"Buying here now very strong Data in Pancreatic cancer, Wells just Upgrades price target to $23"
"I really don't know what to make of this price action. It really seems like this has no support at all. I'm worried about what would happen if Rivocel data isn't perfect. The CEO is presenting at Jefferies tomorrow, so I'll wait to hear his comment before proceeding."
Baker Boys loading up
let it roll baby. in at 2$.. haven't sold hehe. waiting for the jump next friday. new highs
This looks really good today. Glad I bought in earlier in the week. GLTA
"Not sure what's driving the price up (8-K?) but all I know is this company's value is way more than 100M. I'm up 50% in just two weeks, took some profits today (sold 25%), will let the rest ride into double digits."
chart wise.....this doesn't look like a head fake this time.....looks like it started going up after the news broke 15 days ago...
with the amount of shares outstanding. I am thinking that in order to raise capital we are going to have a secondary offering soon once this is settled over 10. What you thinking folks?
today was a great day for BLCMNice bounce off if $6.55.Heading back toward $8Good news and we go parabolic to $15 as a mild start.Low low float will become our good friend.
"Going to fly Monday with this news !,Get in early."
Need to be patient... That said it could rapidly move higher quickly... with minimal downside... My opinion but really does look good!
"Today was a fantastic day for BLCM longs. Despite only 75000 shares traded, PPS up 43 cents and 9 percent.I believe it is a preview of many more great days to come for BLCMThe technology is unique and very effective, potentially extremely valuable in many applications with many drugs.With the scarcity of shares , if news creates demand, I see very significant increase in value as a reasonable possibility.Just as Mr Fair has negotiated very well with MD Anderson, and the Baker Brothers,and the Boxers, I think he will continue to be charming for great business reasons."
"I don't know much at all,about anything, but it seems like the many Form,4s that were filed, apparently. options for management, indicate management think,enough of BLCM to think the options will have value in the future ( possibly,years )I think it's no big deal, but a mild positive nonetheless. Am I right?please correct me if not.I may add some tomorrow."
"This latest move could be the reason why they have enough cash till inot 2021, they bring the burn-rate down significantly"
"Total cash $66M (I believe this is BEFORE the current $25M placement), total debt $28M, market cap $32M. Hah! Apparently their IP has negative value. Investors are rightly exiting though. The PE guys have cornered the stock (certainly most of the upside - given the warrants), and will now try to sell the company/IP over the next 6-12 months."
Hold can be a few days and then resumeFda will decide
"BLCM has been such a disappointment. I've held my long position, and I figure I'll ride this till the end (whether it's bankruptcy or a buyout at a steal of a price). Their IP clearly has SOME value given the partnerships they continue to ink with highly reputable health systems. But they made a hash of commercializing it. I hope they can recover at least some value by selling the company in the next few months."
"I'm worried about the reasons for the drop (that we may not be aware of), but am also REALLY tempted to buy more given what's in the offing this year, in terms of regulatory approval in Europe. What to do..."
I posted a long response Awesome.it was deleted by Yahoo.I think we resume trend up.
"Not quite sure why there was a run up with the 3 of us watching.. People must be now noticing this stock. I think we are going to see a lot of speculation and the outcomes are the same: We raise capital by selling more stocks(this has been going on alot these days with small cap companies.), we go thru with the study and get great results and they push forward or we get bought out. Either way we hold."
The math tells you the estimated dilution ratio...
"The stock is a gift.Look at the Macro pictureHeavy institutional ownershipHeavy Hedge Fund and increasingownershipBaker BrothersMD AndersonPancreatic Cancer progressImpressive presentation coming next weekGreat Q4 very likelyImproved cost control , more strategic focus, much better operating results.This is going to fly.I expect waves upward, not just small increases.The trading already shows increasing increases."
"opinion seeking . I am going to hold my 3,000 shares would you guys buy more on dip, wait till it shows a clear bottom ??"
Buyout for the switch?
"So EHA abstracts out tomorrow. Last year BLCM ran up to 10 during the conference...before dropping to 6, then 4, then current levels. Any bets on price action in the coming month?"
"Amazing. In Europe they have finished the trials and was ready for commercial development. but Bellicum did not want to proceed, but find a strategic partner that should take it over from them. Interesting to see they still continue in USA. Bellicum falls short on explaining the BPX 501 situation in the last few updates."
"it's 11 amvery light volume with PPS advance so far .On the positive side, it seems a very smart buyer is continuing to ever do slowly raise the bid.I think longs should be encouraged by what we are seeing thus far.I believe we will advance swiftly with positive news which I also intuitively believe we will have next week or soon sfterwards"
I fully expect a partner in the future. if not the European approval might provide ample revenue. Either way it's a winner in the making.
"Well this is interesting! I did NOT expect to come on here and see BLCM up 40% today. Surprising, but a welcome development. That said, do people think this will continue to go up in the next few weeks (as more people become interested in BLCM), or do we think it will lose some of this ground (as people take any gains, or people that are still down for the year take their tax losses)? I believe the latter, but maybe I've just become a pessimist after taking a beating on my BLCM position for the last couple of years. I just don't know how significant today's PR is, but let's see what happens."
"Before yesterday's trading started , I believed we could have a good up day because of the expected content of the poster presentation.IP on pancreatic cancer is potentially very valuable.My suspicion was confirmed with the high volume and up side move, 30 percent.However, the significant news to me was the positive market reaction to a BLCM PR.That shows a change in sentiment.Recent positive PRs did not help. Some word has gotten out. The Bakers nor the Boxers nor the other institutes would have invested many more millions if not for the lure of significant return. Their Due Diligence must have been very convincing.I am of the opinion that BLCM has great technology for a huge unmet application .I also believe like our analysts do that the potential for much higher PPS exists."
The whole idea of investing in contributing to the growth of a company. Where does SHORT SELLERS place in ths equation beside chaos?
First read out of pancreatic cancer data in December. That's big.
"Wow, if current trends hold...by the time the DOW breaks 35,000, this stock will be firmly below 0."
"CEO 2 days ago, ""Rivocel is our genetically modified T-cell add-back system cell transplantation. Largely clinically de-risked at this point in pediatric patients with a global trial underway. Randomized phase II/III trial in adult patients to extend our label there. With the expectation that we will file for approval by the end of this year...I mentioned this program is largely clinically de-risked. That is based on the results of BP-004, a basket study of pediatric patients undergoing T-Cell depleted haploidentical transplant followed by Rivocell and receiving rimiducid to activate the safety switch if they have visceral GVHD or GVHD refractory to standard treatments. This is a phase I/II study. It has enrolled almost 250 patients. We presented the interim analyses, that you'll see here, at ASH last year, what I would characterize as a very late interim analysis. We expect the final result this quarter and expect to file for European approval in pediatric patients by the end of this year."""
"I have kept my 3,000 shares that I paid 10 for . actually sold sold 1500 waited the 30 days and bought back the other 1,500 in the 7,s . I think the stock is IN PLAY now and am thinking of adding shares . opinions would be appreciated ."
This stock is going to 10 dollars soon. It was over 16 less than year ago. FDA approval soon.
"I think BLCM is still undervalued with a market cap of only $24M even after going up .81 to $4.65 on Friday after the FDA lifted a clinical hold on the BPX-601 cancer trial. Even though the stock may go down more short term, I think long term it could be a big winner if they get a positive result from either of the two phase 1/2 trials for BPX-601 and BPX-603. For me BLCM checks off all the boxes that I look for in a small biotech stock to invest in. I look for the following things: 1. Good Management (I'll explain below) 2. Low Marketcap ($23.5M) 3. No Long Term Debt (last October paid $27.4M to Oxford Capital to pay off loan) 4. Low Cash Burn (expects annual cash utilization of $25-$30M) 5. Sufficient Cash (BLCM expects cash resources sufficient to meet operating requirements into the second quarter of 2022) 6. Upcoming Catalysts (I'll expain below) Things that I have observed that makes me think management is doing a good job: 1. Jan 2020 sold their Huston facility for $15M to MD Anderson which will manufacture Bellicum’s GoCAR and other cellular therapy programs under a services agreement. 2. Oct 2020, raised $25M in secondary offering and paid off $27.4M long term loan. 3. Oct 2020, announced restructuring program, wherein it will focus on the clinical development of BPX-601 and BPX-603, pause the BCMA GoCAR-NK program, and discontinue discovery research and new product development. Staff will be reduced by 79%, from 68 to 14 employees by the end of this year. 4. Bellicum is actively pursuing a strategic partner for RIVO-CEL to lead future development and commercialization for this product candidate. They are smart not to try to develop RIVO-CEL by there own, too many underfunded small biotech companies have gone bankrupt borrowing large sums of money to try to commercialize a new approved product on their own. 5. They have done a good job in reducing their operating expenses. They had net income loss of $112.5M in 2019, TTM income loss of $55.5M, now they expect only a loss of $25-$30M in 2021.Upcoming Catalyst:1. Announcement of a partner for RIVO-CEL2. Data from BPX-603 phase 1/2 trial.3. Data from BPX-601 phase 1/2 trial. When BLCM reported phase 1 trial results for BPX-601 back on Jan 24, 2020 for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer it caused the stock to rise from $8.10 on Dec 2, 2019 to $22.90 on Jan 13, 2020, and to $12.20 on Jan 27, 2020. These prices are adjusted for a 1 for 10 stock split which occurred on Feb 5, 2020."
"The real issue that I see here, other than the fact that this is still highly speculative, is that they are going to need to do another capital raise sometime in the first or second quarter of next year. Given that the shares are already so cheap, and that the market cap is so low; I think a lot of people are sitting on the sidelines to avoid getting burned. I really don't know though, and I am open to any different and/or opposing opinions. I am otherwise very curious about this company; but I remain cautious."
"I suspect 2.67M shares (or 5.8%) is what Baker Bros currently holds, but they WOULD hold 175M shares (totalling up all the numbers on pg 10 of their filing) if they were to convert all their Preferred shares and Warrants to common stock. That means that if BLCM ever went up in price or were acquired for a higher price, that we'd end up with somewhere around 250M shares, of which Baker Bros would own 175M. And they got this position by spending an aggregate of $80M. In other words, the rest of us have gotten screwed.If BLCM does really well commercially and there is no further offering and the company gets bought for $500M, we'd get $2/share. If it were bought for $1B, that would be $4/share, and Baker Bros would get $700M.Someone please tell me if I'm wrong....."
"Update on BPX-603 expected in Q4. If there's positive news, this could really run. If not, well, we've already seen what it can do in the other direction."
Today Bellicum crossed above the 200 day moving average. The last time this happened was November 2015 I am feeling Bullish on this stock now.
Long term technical charts look amazing..
"BLCM recovery , NBRV just got approved for Pneumonia, very large market"
We will be over $1 soon. Still under 50MM market cap and over 100MM in cash.
"My opinion is we have a company here that is much,like they state, first in class, best in class, unmet needs, unique, and undervalued.I think we will soon look back and see what a great opportunity this is to acquire shares. My two cents."
"The Baker Brothers and Boxer Funds, etc and MD Anderson would not be heavily invested in BLCM if the technology of the switches and the science of the clinic was not exceptional. With the scarcity of outstanding shares, any good news can jump this well over $10 PPS."
"Can someone explain to me the terms of the private placement with Baker Brothers back in August? My understanding is that Bellicum sold warrants to acquire 57.5M shares at $1.30 per share, exercisable for up to 7 years. So we should assume that as the stock price rises, we could get dilution of another 57.5M shares for proceeds of $75M. In other words, our share count would more than double. Is that correct?"
Leak?
"An interesting short article on challenges in CAR-T and near-term opptys. (FWIW, BLCM's programs propose to address at least a few of these issues (tox, expansion, anaergy) http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/481/eaaw2127"
"What in the world is going on here? If the results on BP601 were bad, it seems they wouldn't have submitted an abstract for presentation at ASCO... What am I missing?"
Do they have secondary coming up?
"An analysis of the new ""right to try"" legislation bodes well for companies like BLCM because it provides an expedited pathway to demonstrating efficacy for their products, especially for a proven technology like CAR-T. Now we may see a glimpse sooner than expected on how well their patented safety switch functions..."
https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BLCM
"Full disclosure, I am not a shareholder but am watching intently for an entry point. I see a potentially very positive near-term catalyst in the December oral presentation at ASH, although that appears to not be a release of new data. I know they are also presenting at Jefferies in London today, but my experience in the past is that such investor presentations (as opposed to medical presentations) do not do much for the stock either way. Beyond ASH, the picture is a little fuzzier for me. I know we should be getting advancement of 501 in 2018 but I have not been able to nail down an expected time frame yet. I also am aware of the March 2017 follow on offering at $12 and it appears that BLCM ended Q3 with about $55 million in cash and has had a quarterly burn rate throughout the first 9 months of this year of about $22 million - which makes me think that another follow on is probably in the cards before the end of Q1. I am very attracted to the switching technology incorporated into 501, but the runway there is still a bit lengthy. I will keep up my DD, but would appreciate hearing if anyone thinks I am missing any material factors here. Thanks very much and good luck."

Seems like management is increasing their numbers of shares constantly.
"Many are excited about BP-501, but for me, BP-601 is the one I'm eyeing. Nonresectable pancreatic cancer is the Mount Everest of oncology. If they were to achieve success against that....it would be colossal feat."
I hit my price target. Oops I only have fraction of the shares.
"OMG, we will have a CC. 11/06 5pm. Since we havnt had one the last 2 quarters and after the secondary I bet there will be a lot of questions..."
What time is the presentation on Friday?
Guys do not sell your shares. Hold for a few months.
"Blcm is gonna fly once any news hit. There are hardly ant shares to buy. I placed a market order to buy 10,000 shares this morning and 3300 filled immediately then nothing. I waited 30 mins for the rest of my shares to fill & there were no sellers. So I cancelled my order & placed a limit order instead."
nice reversal!!!
"I presume the company will,do a Press Realease very soon, either the Q Report or something required to report, either positive or not so,much.I hope for a couple or more PR with encouraging information. This has been a tough company to hold for many since the time of double digits.I hope we will start an accent toward that again, but I know better than to be over confident.Good luck all longs. I think we will get indicators soon."
"I'm long BLCM (have been for over two years) so I like the recent uptrend, but I have to admit that I'm nervous about all the speculative ""piling on"" volume, that could go away just as easily as it's coming in. I'll feel a lot better if we can get very promising data in the presentation next week, as then the upside on this thing is a multiple of where we are today."
interesting so far this morning.Seems to be some volume with a bid.please please pleaseChristmas Present??
"is there any good news out of this stock, and any hope?thanks in advance"
"I bought more at 2.09. whatever, the stock is so cheap 400 more shares ain't nothing. I'll hold until 5....maybe more if positive results come end of month."
Finaly up to the 1 year target price 49 $ ??? Cross fingers 
Only facts:- financing recently done and now company has enough to last to at least 1st quarter 2021.- 4 strong pipeline candidates.- in talks to partner rivo-cell which had positive ph3 results.- ready to apply for rivo-cell for MAA in Europe in q4-q1 2020.- Baker Bros averaged down @ $1.00. heavy with 5.6% stake- other tutes did as well- CEO bought 60000+ shares in past 3 month.- share price near the bottom.- shares outstanding on fully diluted basis less than 200 mil.do ur own dd.
"These things usually last a couple of months. The hold, also, is usually lifted. Holds like this are generally considered a cautious move that sometimes will result in a change in protocol, often narrowing the subject inclusion criteria."
Study results are interesting. Shows they have a viable cell membrane target. Patients received limited dosing and candidate therapy achieved some response. Study will certainly need to be expanded. I'm curious as to why drug required cyclophosphamide conditioning prior to receiving activated t cells. Any thoughts?
closed at 6.66. what more do you need to know.
"Does anyone have any ideas to the cause of the drop? The lawsuit doesn't present any new information; it's related to the issues that lead to the clinical hold by the FDA on BPX-501, which were eventually lifted. I wonder if it's just technical/institutional shenanigans or if there's some other reason. The company has stated confidence in the Rivocel data remaining positive and there's additional 601 data being presented soon, so I'm curious as to why there seems to be such negative sentiment."
"If I look at Yahoo news, so many litigation- yet the stock is rising, this is positive sign, buying time!"
Does someone know where I can get info on who is buying or selling a stock before the publication of 13F forms? Basically I need to know if the Baker Brothers are buying back the shares they sold previously.
Strong Buy BLCM going Soars soon .81 easy money$$$$$
"In and out over the last couple of years. Never made money on BLCM, but avoided losing any. Bought back in today. Stock is acting well.I think they will have good news to report in mid June. Just my hunch"
"I don't understand why they wouldn't do a conference call. With their share price constantly being destroyed, it would be a good time to promote the value of the company. They just got their positive endpoint on what should be a major value driver for the company... and they don't even talk about it. Pretty frustrating"

Soaring today! Looking promising
"I cannot help myself.I am excited that BLCM may be at an inflection point.maybe these two upcoming conferences will stir up some additional interest.Mr. Fair stated he would provide greater flow of news.it is very unlikely that he was not referring to potentially good news.I hope so and think so.Last time I owned BLCM I made a whole bunch selling near $7.50.This time I expect to hold for a long time and feel the PPS can go far above $10 and maybe well above $20my intuitionand my DD Baker Brothers, MDAnderson and Mr Fair can bring us to the promise land in my opinion.I think big Pharma is about to get interested and invest in us."
Patience.......adding to my total here.......they have the science and intellectual property........should rebound.....before end of year......patience.....
the reason they sold the facility is to reduce the operation expense which is great. they will still have the supply aggrement there for GoCar. this is a very smart. this will all be explained during the presentation friday. im loading hard right now
Someone accumulated this week. They started on September 15th and possibly did again yesterday. Or it could be someone else but both of these days volume jumped considerably. Over the past two weeks close to 2 million shares moved the stock higher by over 60%. No doubt this stock is trying to move higher and we should see $10 next week.
"I am long here at a very low average but... I'm not happy about the RS, I'm hoping this will be a good way to lower volatility but normally after an RS, shorts come and attack"
https://traders-ideas.com/aiperformance
"I have an embarrassingly large position in BLCM, and remain optimistic long-term, but am disappointed by the latest earnings call. It seems highly unlikely that we'll get the partner announcement I was counting on. I suspect we'll drift downward through the end of the year due to tax loss selling, before hopefully going up in the new year. GLTA."
We have an analyst pounding the table on BCLM today finally getting some attention for some great work. 2 thumbs up!
anyone know an estimated timeline for EU results?
No news as to what is causing the sale. Fear selling added to fear selling. Nothing going on to justify the slide in price. Buy more ASAP.
"There's not really much information, so I don't think it's fair to assume this will be resolved very quickly. Hard to tell until more information comes out. However from what I understand meetings with the FDA take a while to obtain. So even if this is a small issue, it could take months for them to see the FDA in order to discuss it."
"The price action is worrying me, as I can't understand the reasons for the precipitous decline. I'm wondering if the Rivocell update is bad, and that news has leaked to someone. I don't intend to sell based on that fear, but am certainly waiting for news with bated breath."
Any comments of ER meeting? good or not? thanks.
Lets not forget the rivocel development with the strategic partner. Assume that this will give more funding to their core business of BPX 601 and subsequent products.
I feel like this is a buy and hold kinda stock.
"I’m not sure why I’m surprised. Shareholders aren’t the priority of these companies. Why execute the reverse split and provide nothing to help prop up the price? Nothing from Mgmt, at all. The price is headed right back to where my cost/average was pre-split"
"But how do we feel about the upcoming shareholders meeting on 15th Januari where there will be a vote on reverse split 5 to 10 against 1 share.Is there not the danger that they will do the reverse split of say 5, to push up the shareprice so that they can issue new shares at reasonable share price to get more capital. In this case we would see significant dilution of share value.How do people on this forum see this risk?"
"Why is this significant?T-cell cancer therapies already exist and the development of cancer immunotherapy has been one of the most exciting advances in the field.The most famous example is CAR-T - a living drug made by genetically engineering a patient's T-cells to seek out and destroy cancer.CAR-T can have dramatic results that transform some patients from being terminally ill to being in complete remission.However, the approach is highly specific and works in only a limited number of cancers where there is a clear target to train the T-cells to spot.And it has struggled to have any success in ""solid cancers"" - those that form tumours rather than blood cancers such as leukaemia.The researchers say their T-cell receptor could lead to a ""universal"" cancer treatment."
today was a great day.Us longs may be extremely happy we have BLCM this year.This year may be a great one for each of us who took a big risk.
"Extremely undervalued. OORates are exceptional and the longer CAR-T is on the market the longer they will see the benefit of safety switch. Recent results from Kymria and Yescarta show serious cytokine reactions, grade 3 S/E. Bellicum will prevail."
I am feeling suspect. I suspect the owing.I suspect the clinical data regarding the poster presentation will be quite positive.I also suspect the CC overall will also be positive.Therefore. I suspect we have a chance of moving upward.Am I brilliant or what? No need to answer.
"I'm long BLCM (a lot), and have no intention to sell, but as much as I hate to admit it, I think it's pretty clear we're headed back to $1 (and they will likely go through with the reverse split). I don't see any opportunities for positive news until Q3 (absent a surprise Rivocell sale/partnership), and in the absence of news, I think this will continue to meander down. That said, the reason I'm holding is because I think the most recent data were solid, and I think this should be a buyout candidate if their pipeline keeps progressing. I might even add some more if we go back to $1. Good luck to the longs. Hopefully our patience will be rewarded in the long run."
Great news. High was 16$ when they filed for FDA. FDA lifted hold finally. back to highs.
Daytraded this couple weeks back @3 now cut in half...in @ 1.66 will hold..not much to lose here but upside potential big when rivo data comes out soon
"This is from the Houston business journal:“We’re a little bit away from an answer on whether [Bellicum’s] technology is working in humans,” Fair told the HBJ. “And rather than fund ourselves for six, nine or 12 months at a time, I think the view we had was, ‘It would be great to secure capital to allow us to focus on execution of those programs and proof of concept and the [CAR T-cell therapy] technology for the next couple of years and to lock in the runway for that.”"
