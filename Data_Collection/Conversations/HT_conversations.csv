Smh have they started to lay ppl off yet?? Cv is doing this industry in!
"I finally took the time to run some models. The lowest floor price for HT that I got was $13.80. I believe that it may fall some more depending on the next Q numbers. At $14, this would scream ""BUY"". The div stream appears fairly safe but cannot be confident about a growth in the div. But at a 7% div yield without any price appreciation, some folks may be happy.. a safe return of 7% is not trivial. Clip the div and be happy..."

"Looking at the most recent financials, here is what I see:Lots of debt = close to $1.2B. Say melded interest rate of 4% (rather low to tell the truth), would mean interest expense of $48Mill annually. Say interest payment is spread over 4 quarters. Implies 12M each qtr. Company has 27Mill in cash. So, can last 2 quarters with zero customers in their hotels if they use cash to service debt ($24M) and have no employee expenses other than upkeep of hotels (3M). So, if customers come back to hotel in third quarter, HT should not have any problems being solvent and able to service debt. Management should ask lenders to reduce debt service payments just to make sure. In my opinion, the death of this REIT has been overstated. Will there be any dividends for three quarters? NO. Will the firm survive until at least Q3... YES. Does the firm need to liquidate properties to survive? NO...There ya go...."

"Feel good about the recovery they are seeing. As posted a few months back, I predicted the corporate level cashflow to keep improving. Demands for key markets and groups/events coming up. I like the recovery story in the industry and HT stock price is not reflecting that yet. Bought more today as this should be Getting back to $10-$14 very quickly."

I wouldn't be surprised if HT takes out Friday's low on Monday. It is written on the wall.

Wonder if these guys are solvent? The stock keeps falling despite higher reported occupancy rates? Any guidance on them?
"So let me get this straight. We are now at the same level as we were before MDD, Migraine and the deal with Pfizer was announced which added another asset to our portfolio. I'm sorry but this is beyond my comprehension at this point why people would sell. Oh well, I just wish I had the funds to be a $ht load now. Good luck."

I would be quite careful of this stock as I just sent a demand letter to Mr. Jay Shah. The pain and suffering damages in Indiana appear to be unlimited. I was treated poorly by this establishment. I am a fundamentalish in my approach to stock picking. When i go into an organization the way they operate is my first litmus test. This place obviously failed and i would render it a very strong sell. Good luck!

Just looked at previous 10Q. The earnings release on July 30 does not look promising. Probably looking at a $1(min) to $2(max) pullback in price post earnings.Data on hotel occupancy is alarming..http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/data-dashboard

Watch out. This thing will go down. Get out if you can. Even before COVID in Feb it was only 14. No revenues; hotels in big cities that are not open yet. Already laying off people. Read this https://www.theday.com/business/20200604/mystic-marriott-laying-off-162-employees

How about the HT Preferred stock...worth getting in if it continues to drop? Enough assets to cover preferred in liquidation?
HT reached a 52 Week low at 14.29
"As mentioned previously, $14 buy was good, huh?"
If the dividend is reinstated at some point to the level it was pre covid the stock would be yielding 13% at todays price.
Lots of insiders family member buying
Pretty resilient stock. Driving to city center hotels is going to be the new norm for a while... People will want to stay in these properties instead of the local Howard Johnson down by the interchange.
Beats and no one cares. Did you hear that HT is doing retreats for DWAC's social network and accepting DOGE coin? Stock will hit 300.... lol
Are these guys a bankruptcy risk?
"There were a couple Seeking Alpha articles written about HT and I tried asking whether HT's hotels are full or limited service, but they didn't respond. Does anyone know what the average expense ratios on these hotels are? I noticed that the price/ sales ratio is less than 1, which would be commensurate with a full-service hotel with a 90%+ expense ratio. That is, unless the market really hates HT and it is selling for much less than NAV, which it sounds like it is"

"Hotels are going to pot. I was in HT before the 1:4 reverse split, several years ago, when trading around $4, which became $16. It now is back down around $3.50, and the economy is much worse than it was before the split. I see hotels closing, or at least laying off most of the staff, resulting in greatly reduced levels of service."
"Corona Virus downturn in markets is justified. But not for all stocks. For HT, the downturn is not justified... While international travel will decline, travelers desiring vacations will then opt to stay local. HT hotels are mostly all domestic and can gain from this focus to domestic vacations. Just my two cents."

Revpar for the whole hotel sector is weak. This will affect HT also. I am waiting for earnings release before I invest

"The C-suite execs of this company should all take a massive cut in salary also to show their commitment to share the pain with the stockholders. Also, they should be making purchases of the stock if they are devoted to the company. Once travel resumes and hotel stays begin again, this stock should be fine. But the execs need to credibly express confidence in the business. NOW!!"

"Do readers realize how undervalued HT is currently? It is trading @ .59x Book value. I went through their recent earnings report: If ALL debt is subtracted from ALL assets, they are worth $17.65/share. If they sold all the properties tomorrow at market rates, and used the proceeds to pay-off all mortgages, term loans, and secured notes, that is how much would be left-over for shareholders (including all cash): $17.65/share.By investing in HT at $9, you are buying the assets at a 40% discount, and acquiring the REIT business for FREE.And this at the end of the Pandemic, when Hospitality is about to emerge from the crisis. Not at the beginning"

"I Realize Pro traders do so when the options markets are open yet yesterday's Bitcoin & ETH value or transaction was way below $700,000,000. Considering that Coinbase is 3rd largest exchage, do you realize how much of the BTC happens on Coinbase? Less than 4% I've invested/ traded all my life, stocks/Crypto and having used CBP and seeing they never publically speak of their disastrous customer service dept....let alone make meaningful inprovements....With Banks, Asian exchanges capturing mkt share away from CB....Cb's corporate behsavior...fined by the SEC...I cannot fathom why this company was allowed to go public. Exchange Volumes are so dismal, even high flying $ht coins are thinly traded and most if not all volitilty gone.

This stock is going to $16 in April. Dividends are quite safe
Rooms oversupply in all markets this and next year. HT available rooms count will be higher as more rooms come into operation. Revpar doesn’t look great Not only will there be competition on the sales side but new hotel developments will bid up hospitality labor price in all cities.Strong efforts are needed in marketing and HR while trimming operating costs. They may better monetize some properties by abandoning brands and operating indie. Also by growing dining/entertainment space.
It would be a nice Christmas if HT could hit $10 by the end of the year. A couple of properties are being sold at the first of the year to help with debt that could giv it another boost.

Anecdotally I know a lot of people travelling again to these major cities. My work is starting to travel again too. This seems like a good time to start accumulating shares.
