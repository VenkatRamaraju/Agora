Revpar for the whole hotel sector is weak. This will affect HT also. I am waiting for earnings release before I invest

I'm aiming to buy a $hT load of this junk pile down to around $19.58 before this weekend starts if I'm lucky.P.S. I don't want you idiots again replying to this post like you did when I said they wouldn't take it above $22.73 when it was above $22 before the report. Please!
If the dividend is reinstated at some point to the level it was pre covid the stock would be yielding 13% at todays price.
To anyone reading this MB.... I am NOT a full time basher if DVAX - unlike Zeve who is paid to throw $ht against the wall to bash and see what sticks——- I’m just calling levels as I saw them and using info I found on what Bain’s Playbook would be.... so far it appears I have been correct...... but it has to run afterwards for me to be right.

"There were a couple Seeking Alpha articles written about HT and I tried asking whether HT's hotels are full or limited service, but they didn't respond. Does anyone know what the average expense ratios on these hotels are? I noticed that the price/ sales ratio is less than 1, which would be commensurate with a full-service hotel with a 90%+ expense ratio. That is, unless the market really hates HT and it is selling for much less than NAV, which it sounds like it is"

It now is back down around $3.50, and the economy is much worse than it was before the split. I see hotels closing, or at least laying off most of the staff, resulting in greatly reduced levels of service."

"Looking at the most recent financials, here is what I see:Lots of debt = close to $1.2B. Say melded interest rate of 4% (rather low to tell the truth), would mean interest expense of $48Mill annually. Say interest payment is spread over 4 quarters. Implies 12M each qtr. Company has 27Mill in cash. So, can last 2 quarters with zero customers in their hotels if they use cash to service debt ($24M) and have no employee expenses other than upkeep of hotels (3M). So, if customers come back to hotel in third quarter, HT should not have any problems being solvent and able to service debt. Management should ask lenders to reduce debt service payments just to make sure. In my opinion, the death of this REIT has been overstated. Will there be any dividends for three quarters? NO. Will the firm survive until at least Q3... YES. Does the firm need to liquidate properties to survive? NO...There ya go...."

I would be quite careful of this stock as I just sent a demand letter to Mr. Jay Shah. The pain and suffering damages in Indiana appear to be unlimited. I was treated poorly by this establishment. I am a fundamentalish in my approach to stock picking. When i go into an organization the way they operate is my first litmus test. This place obviously failed and i would render it a very strong sell. Good luck!

I expect good news tin the earnings tomorrow. This quarter result will be good but most importantly how March/April performance is doing which based on industry data seems to be doing quite well. This might be above $14 before the end of the week.
"My comment 7 days ago was spot on, this guys are returning to positive hotel cashflow and they should be hotel and corporate cash flow positive in the next couple of months. This might be in the 20s by the summer!"
This company struggled even before pandemic. Needs lots of luck to survive.

"I finally took the time to run some models. The lowest floor price for HT that I got was $13.80. I believe that it may fall some more depending on the next Q numbers.

But at a 7% div yield without any price appreciation, some folks may be happy.. a safe return of 7% is not trivial. Clip the div and be happy..."

Rooms oversupply in all markets this and next year. HT available rooms count will be higher as more rooms come into operation. Revpar doesn’t look great Not only will there be competition on the sales side but new hotel developments will bid up hospitality labor price in all cities.Strong efforts are needed in marketing and HR while trimming operating costs. They may better monetize some properties by abandoning brands and operating indie. Also by growing dining/entertainment space.
