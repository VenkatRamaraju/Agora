"The C-suite execs of this company should all take a massive cut in salary also to show their commitment to share the pain with the stockholders. Also, they should be making purchases of the stock if they are devoted to the company. Once travel resumes and hotel stays begin again, this stock should be fine. But the execs need to credibly express confidence in the business. NOW!!"

Rooms oversupply in all markets this and next year. HT available rooms count will be higher as more rooms come into operation. Revpar doesn’t look great Not only will there be competition on the sales side but new hotel developments will bid up hospitality labor price in all cities.Strong efforts are needed in marketing and HR while trimming operating costs. They may better monetize some properties by abandoning brands and operating indie. Also by growing dining/entertainment space.

"Corona Virus downturn in markets is justified. But not for all stocks. For HT, the downturn is not justified... While international travel will decline, travelers desiring vacations will then opt to stay local. HT hotels are mostly all domestic and can gain from this focus to domestic vacations. Just my two cents."

"Hotels are going to pot. I was in HT before the 1:4 reverse split, several years ago, when trading around $4, which became $16. It now is back down around $3.50, and the economy is much worse than it was before the split. I see hotels closing, or at least laying off most of the staff, resulting in greatly reduced levels of service."
Listen... This is a shorts wet dream. I have 15 PUT options and they are doing amazing. Tomorrow will be down 10% easy then you can have it back.

"I Realize Pro traders do so when the options markets are open yet yesterday's Bitcoin & ETH value or transaction was way below $700,000,000. Considering that Coinbase is 3rd largest exchage, do you realize how much of the BTC happens on Coinbase? Less than 4% I've invested/ traded all my life, stocks/Crypto and having used CBP and seeing they never publically speak of their disastrous customer service dept....let alone make meaningful inprovements....With Banks, Asian exchanges capturing mkt share away from CB....Cb's corporate behsavior...fined by the SEC...I cannot fathom why this company was allowed to go public. Exchange Volumes are so dismal, even high flying $ht coins are thinly traded and most if not all volitilty gone. While this is not financial advice...at least protect yourself by buying some early July dated Puts as once crypto volumes are posted....people gonna fly for the exits."

I expect good news tin the earnings tomorrow. This quarter result will be good but most importantly how March/April performance is doing which based on industry data seems to be doing quite well. This might be above $14 before the end of the week.

"I finally took the time to run some models. The lowest floor price for HT that I got was $13.80. I believe that it may fall some more depending on the next Q numbers. At $14, this would scream ""BUY"". The div stream appears fairly safe but cannot be confident about a growth in the div. But at a 7% div yield without any price appreciation, some folks may be happy.. a safe return of 7% is not trivial. Clip the div and be happy..."

"There were a couple Seeking Alpha articles written about HT and I tried asking whether HT's hotels are full or limited service, but they didn't respond. Does anyone know what the average expense ratios on these hotels are? I noticed that the price/ sales ratio is less than 1, which would be commensurate with a full-service hotel with a 90%+ expense ratio. That is, unless the market really hates HT and it is selling for much less than NAV, which it sounds like it is"

I would be quite careful of this stock as I just sent a demand letter to Mr. Jay Shah. The pain and suffering damages in Indiana appear to be unlimited. I was treated poorly by this establishment. I am a fundamentalish in my approach to stock picking. When i go into an organization the way they operate is my first litmus test. This place obviously failed and i would render it a very strong sell. Good luck!

Just looked at previous 10Q. The earnings release on July 30 does not look promising. Probably looking at a $1(min) to $2(max) pullback in price post earnings.Data on hotel occupancy is alarming..http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/data-dashboard

If the dividend is reinstated at some point to the level it was pre covid the stock would be yielding 13% at todays price.
"Looking at the most recent financials, here is what I see:Lots of debt = close to $1.2B. Say melded interest rate of 4% (rather low to tell the truth), would mean interest expense of $48Mill annually. Say interest payment is spread over 4 quarters. Implies 12M each qtr. Company has 27Mill in cash. So, can last 2 quarters with zero customers in their hotels if they use cash to service debt ($24M) and have no employee expenses other than upkeep of hotels (3M). So, if customers come back to hotel in third quarter, HT should not have any problems being solvent and able to service debt. Management should ask lenders to reduce debt service payments just to make sure. In my opinion, the death of this REIT has been overstated. Will there be any dividends for three quarters? NO. Will the firm survive until at least Q3... YES. Does the firm need to liquidate properties to survive? NO...There ya go...."
