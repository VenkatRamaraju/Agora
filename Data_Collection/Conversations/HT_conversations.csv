Just looked at previous 10Q. The earnings release on July 30 does not look promising. Probably looking at a $1(min) to $2(max) pullback in price post earnings.Data on hotel occupancy is alarming..http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/data-dashboard
Pretty resilient stock. Driving to city center hotels is going to be the new norm for a while... People will want to stay in these properties instead of the local Howard Johnson down by the interchange.
earnings should surprise in the next week
Beats and no one cares. Did you hear that HT is doing retreats for DWAC's social network and accepting DOGE coin? Stock will hit 300.... lol
Rooms oversupply in all markets this and next year. HT available rooms count will be higher as more rooms come into operation. Revpar doesn’t look great Not only will there be competition on the sales side but new hotel developments will bid up hospitality labor price in all cities.Strong efforts are needed in marketing and HR while trimming operating costs. They may better monetize some properties by abandoning brands and operating indie. Also by growing dining/entertainment space.
"There were a couple Seeking Alpha articles written about HT and I tried asking whether HT's hotels are full or limited service, but they didn't respond. Does anyone know what the average expense ratios on these hotels are? I noticed that the price/ sales ratio is less than 1, which would be commensurate with a full-service hotel with a 90%+ expense ratio. That is, unless the market really hates HT and it is selling for much less than NAV, which it sounds like it is"
"$HT Shah Jay H, Chief Executive Officer of HERSHA HOSPITALITY TRUST bought 30000 shares on 2020-06-24. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=HT"
"My comment 7 days ago was spot on, this guys are returning to positive hotel cashflow and they should be hotel and corporate cash flow positive in the next couple of months. This might be in the 20s by the summer!"
To anyone reading this MB.... I am NOT a full time basher if DVAX - unlike Zeve who is paid to throw $ht against the wall to bash and see what sticks——- I’m just calling levels as I saw them and using info I found on what Bain’s Playbook would be.... so far it appears I have been correct...... but it has to run afterwards for me to be right.
"I finally took the time to run some models. The lowest floor price for HT that I got was $13.80. I believe that it may fall some more depending on the next Q numbers. At $14, this would scream ""BUY"". The div stream appears fairly safe but cannot be confident about a growth in the div. But at a 7% div yield without any price appreciation, some folks may be happy.. a safe return of 7% is not trivial. Clip the div and be happy..."
"This stock is vastly oversold. Based on stability of dividends alone, it should be at least at $13.50. In the meantime, those buying at such low prices will get a steady +8% yield on their money...."
"So let me get this straight. We are now at the same level as we were before MDD, Migraine and the deal with Pfizer was announced which added another asset to our portfolio. I'm sorry but this is beyond my comprehension at this point why people would sell. Oh well, I just wish I had the funds to be a $ht load now. Good luck."
HT is up 6.36% to 8.69
Are these guys a bankruptcy risk?
It would be a nice Christmas if HT could hit $10 by the end of the year. A couple of properties are being sold at the first of the year to help with debt that could giv it another boost.
"Feel good about the recovery they are seeing. As posted a few months back, I predicted the corporate level cashflow to keep improving. Demands for key markets and groups/events coming up. I like the recovery story in the industry and HT stock price is not reflecting that yet. Bought more today as this should be Getting back to $10-$14 very quickly."
Strange how this stock shot up a while back and has been steadily declining again. Then another big loss today. C'mon! :(
"I believe we have reached a floor at $14HNN reports flat REVPAR this qtrSo, most earnings are going to be as expected in hospitality There will be some upside to about $17 -$20 range in next 6 mths,"
$aht https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-provides-recent-234500485.html $18.32 cash per share sounds great. Even the naysayers value aht at $14-$23. FDA full vaccine approval means it will soar. $ht $mar $hlt $h
10% of USA population has been vaccinated. New covid cases are declining.Pent up travel demand. All good for revpar!
"Earnings was forecast to be -0.79 and came in at a penny, with forecasted earnings to improve! Watch this thing SOAR tomorrow!"
"Hersha Hospitality Trust will release its financial results for the third quarter 2021 after the market close on Tuesday, October 26, 2021. The Company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 9:00 AM Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 27, 2021."

"Corona Virus downturn in markets is justified. But not for all stocks. For HT, the downturn is not justified... While international travel will decline, travelers desiring vacations will then opt to stay local. HT hotels are mostly all domestic and can gain from this focus to domestic vacations. Just my two cents."
I expect good news tin the earnings tomorrow. This quarter result will be good but most importantly how March/April performance is doing which based on industry data seems to be doing quite well. This might be above $14 before the end of the week.
HT did not pay my dividend! Did they announce the cut??? I heard nothing!
"Well, its on its way! Looks like Vaccine news is good for HT!"
Anecdotally I know a lot of people travelling again to these major cities. My work is starting to travel again too. This seems like a good time to start accumulating shares.
"The C-suite execs of this company should all take a massive cut in salary also to show their commitment to share the pain with the stockholders. Also, they should be making purchases of the stock if they are devoted to the company. Once travel resumes and hotel stays begin again, this stock should be fine. But the execs need to credibly express confidence in the business. NOW!!"
How about the HT Preferred stock...worth getting in if it continues to drop? Enough assets to cover preferred in liquidation?
"Stock is fair value/slightly undervalued at this price. I’d recommend pickup at any price shy of $14. In Jan, this should be at $17 to $18"
"$aht great earnings report, next one will be stellar! Fully booked, ended parasitic deal with Ashford Hospitality Inc, many preferred shares converted, occupancy at all time highs so can charge highest prices. Up, up, up! Rated buy with price target $4 by both https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aht/analyst-research & https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aht/forecast AHT market cap 224m with 508m revenue, pk market cap 5B with 830m revenue. Aht screaming buy esp with vaccines.$pk $ht $drh $sho"
"Do readers realize how undervalued HT is currently? It is trading @ .59x Book value. I went through their recent earnings report: If ALL debt is subtracted from ALL assets, they are worth $17.65/share. If they sold all the properties tomorrow at market rates, and used the proceeds to pay-off all mortgages, term loans, and secured notes, that is how much would be left-over for shareholders (including all cash): $17.65/share.By investing in HT at $9, you are buying the assets at a 40% discount, and acquiring the REIT business for FREE.And this at the end of the Pandemic, when Hospitality is about to emerge from the crisis. Not at the beginning"
If the dividend is reinstated at some point to the level it was pre covid the stock would be yielding 13% at todays price.
"WISE----Is there something terribly wrong with ""G""???????? and ""OIL""??????? Never have seen $ht like what they go on and on about for nothing. Signed ""WORN OUT SILVER!!!!!!!!"""
HT is the only one on this list which is way above the price target of $6. All the others are still below their price target. I sold my full position yesterday but just wanted people to be cautious with HT.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3581451-lodging-stocks-viewed-favorably-wells-fargo
"Hospitality has bottomed in Q2’20. It’s all recovery from there specially once the vaccines start to take effect. The segment HT is in was hit the hardest, but current valuations seems low. They should back to cash flow positive once winter is over ."
"Looking at the most recent financials, here is what I see:Lots of debt = close to $1.2B. Say melded interest rate of 4% (rather low to tell the truth), would mean interest expense of $48Mill annually. Say interest payment is spread over 4 quarters. Implies 12M each qtr. Company has 27Mill in cash. So, can last 2 quarters with zero customers in their hotels if they use cash to service debt ($24M) and have no employee expenses other than upkeep of hotels (3M). So, if customers come back to hotel in third quarter, HT should not have any problems being solvent and able to service debt. Management should ask lenders to reduce debt service payments just to make sure. In my opinion, the death of this REIT has been overstated. Will there be any dividends for three quarters? NO. Will the firm survive until at least Q3... YES. Does the firm need to liquidate properties to survive? NO...There ya go...."
"This will go to $10 easily when the vaccine comes out... probably July 31st 2021Travel will resume, more effective treatment protocols, etc will make it safer for hotel stays."
