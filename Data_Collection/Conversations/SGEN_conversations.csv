"Morgan Stanley note:3Q was another strong quarter with product sales ~6% ahead of consensus. Mgt. raised topline guidance modestly, which we see as conservative heading into 4Q. Daiichi arbitration outcome and pipeline remains the key drivers of SGEN.WHAT'S CHANGED? From: To: Seagen Inc (SGEN.O) Price Target $167.00 $181.00Strong quarter should be rewarded: Mgt. has delivered two very good quarters in a row when investors were worried about long-term growth prospects. Given the solid results we would expect SGEN to move higher tomorrow and investors remain focused on the positive risk/reward into the arbitration results by YE. PT to $181."
"2022 growth coming from new launches + label expansionWe continue to like the Seagen growth profile after a strong 3Q21 print that was drivenby solid performance across the product portfolio and accompanied by raised 2021guidance – which we still see as potentially conservative (see our 3Q21 results report).Indeed, we think Seagen is positioned well to kick-off another year of beat/raises in2022 (revenues BofAe $2.2B vs. cons $2.2B) with: 1) the continued launch andexpansion into additional geographies for Tukysa (2022 BofAe $530M vs. $508M cons),2) Tivdak launch (see our approval report) in metastatic cervical cancer ($77M vs. $61M),and 3) stable Adcetris base (13% 2021-2025 CAGR). Looking beyond 2022, we like theupside opportunity from expansion of Tukysa into earlier lines of breast cancer and intocolorectal carcinoma (MOUNTAINEER completed enrollment) and from pushing Padcevinto earlier lines (see our Padcev ASCO report) of metastatic urothelial cancer (Cohort Kof 1L study is full enrolled). Long term, we see optionality from earlier programs such asthe recently in-licensed disitamab vedotin (DV, solid tumors), ladiratuzumab vedotin (seeour ESMO report) in metastatic breast cancer, SEA-CD40 in pancreatic cancer, and otherantibody drug conjugate (ADC) and non-ADC assets. Investors will also be happy to hearthat Seagen reiterated its intent to achieve profitability, and though no timeline wasprovided, we think the aforementioned commercial and pipeline developments shouldposition the company to make good on its intention. We continue to think the marketunderappreciates Seagen’s above average growth profile and see a strong risk/rewardprofile for SGEN in the coming years (see our NPV analysis). Reiterate Buy & $210 PO.Pipeline UpdatesWe see multiple opportunities for value creation in 2022 including potential data fromthe MOUNTAINEER study of Tukysa in colorectal carcinoma and from Cohort K oftheEV-103 study of Padcev + Keytruda in 1L metastatic urothelial cancer. In the meantime,Adcetris updates are expected at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting."

every drug beat rev estimates and were raised. THe headline that they missed EPS by 1.04 is wrong. That number included the one time 200 million payment to Remegen. One negative is they raised r and D expense around 20 percent. As a long term holder I am fine with that. But that is a huge increase. Also sm increase to S g and A. Very happy with the numbers as long as the additional R and D spend does not bring another secondary
FWIW--Yesterday marked the all time high for SGEN stock and here we are a year later 45 points lower despite an abundance of good news. Hopefully the good news continues and we will surpass that milestone high in the near future as the fundamentals are getting better every day. GLTL.
"If Seagen's enfortumab gets more positive data in combination with Merck's Keytruda in their multiple ongoing clinical trials, Merck is going to get really interested in Seagen. If I was big pharma, I would be very nervous if Merck buys Seagen, and then go to war to enforce ADC IP. Merck will seek injunctions and not just for settlements/royalties if they own the ADC linker IP."
"Think about this: One year ago this month, SGEN was at $215 and the S & P 500 was around 3400. This month, SGEN sits at $179 and the S & P 500 is at 4600.Quick math: SGEN down 20%, S & P 500 up 35%.WOW, SGEN continues to execute exceptionally well while investor interest lies elsewhere....and, yes, I also realize that SGEN has been doing much better the last few months....relative to where it bottomed out."
"ANOTHER Fantastic Quarter - EVERY DRUG beat even BofA (Highest on the Street) Estimates, as well as Royalty Beat AND GUIDANCE was RAISED for end of year Estimates (& MGMNT is ALWAYS CONSERVATIVE which I appreciate - Under Promise & Over Deliver). Without the $200 Million Upfront payment to Remegen (which wasn't included in Street Estimates) EPS Loss would have been roughly (0.51) which also beat even BofA's and The Street Estimates by 0.05 cents. I am perfectly fine with them plowing more money into R&D as the SCIENCE has been proven time and again to be effective. 4 Commercial Drugs and more in pipeline and further applications for those 4 drugs mean more Revenue going forward. Also doesn't hurt that Merck is up roughly 20% in the last month as I have always felt they were the most likely buyer of SGEN. Keytruda meshes well with us and of course they already made an investment in us at $200.00 last year. Congrats to management on continuing to help those dealing with this terrible disease and continued Best Of Luck To All My Fellow Longs Here - GREAT QUARTER!"
"b of a updateSGEN US – Rating: BUY (B-1-9) | PO: 210.00 USD | Price: 164.69 USDWe think Seagen'spipeline opportunities, new product launches, label expansionopportunities, and solid Adcetris base (13% 2021-2025 CAGR)positionthe company wellfor an above average growth profile, which we continue to see the marketunderappreciate. We still like the strong SGENrisk / reward (see our NPV analysis), with abull scenario additional valuation of >$100/sh. With this backdrop, we look to the 3Q21call for further details on Padcev label expansion (see our ASCO report), Tukysa launch inadditional geographies, and initial launch metrics for Tivdak in mCC (2021/2022:$22M/$76M vs. $12M/$64M cons; see our Tivdak approval report). For the quarter, weare slightly above consensus on Adcetris (+$1M), Padcev (+$2M), and Tukysa (+$4M),with our above consensus revenue expectations coming largely from a faster thanexpected OUS recovery (ex-US Adcetris royalties +$8M vs. cons). After a solid start to2021 (see our 1Q21 results and 2Q21 results reports) and potentially conservativetopline guidance, we are raising 2021 revenue and EPS from $1,508M and $(1.99) to$1,532M (vs. $1,501M cons) and -$1.94 (vs. -$2.15 cons) on a stronger than expectedTukysa launch ($333M from $314M). Maintain Buy and $210 PO.• We expect focus on the call will be on updated guidance expectations after a strong1H21 and improving COVID-19 outlook• We also look forward to discussion on the initial launch metrics for Tivdak in mCCafter the September 21st FDA approval• Pipeline updates will also be of interest including LV data presented at ESMO,enrollment in the Padcev/Keytruda 1L mUC EV-103 study, and Tukysa expansion intoearlier lines of breast cancer treatment (HER2CLIMB-02 study) and in additionaltumor settings (colorectal in MOUNTAINEER, gastric in MOUNTAINEER-02)"
Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson maintains Seagen with a Outperform and raises the price target from $196 to $198.
FWIW---I am looking forward with great anticipation to the 3rd quarter earnings report which I think will be very positive with respect to revenues across the board and continued progress in our large number of drug trials. What I am really looking for is some positive news on the CD-40 trial for Pancreatic cancer which could be a massive game changer as there has not been much progress in treating this disease.

Morgan Stanley maintains Seagen with a Equal-Weight and raises the price target from $167 to $181.
"The fact that PTAB refused to even listen to Daiichi's challenge to Seagen's IP validity, that is a very bad sign for Daiichi. Basically the patent office says that Daiichi has nothing new and their challenge does not have any merit, and don't waste our time.Now, the arbitration happened on 9/15/2021 with a 30 days follow-up window to reach an agreement between Seagen and Daiichi before 10/15/2021. If that doesn't happen, then I believe the arbitration will issue their ruling any time after that. With the PTAB decision, arbitration will most likely follow the PTAB and rule in favor of Seagen. Next, it will be up to both companies to either settle or head to court on the IP infringement case in 2022. However, if arbitration is ruled in favor of Seagen, then there is very little chance that the court will go against both PTAB and arbitration ruling. I hope if Daiichi is foolish enough to go to court, then Seagen should got to the maximum damage to Daiichi on border of injunction to sell any of their drugs within the IP coverage. If they want to settle after going to court, then they should pay for a very high double digit royalty, court fees, and huge settlement starting at billions. This will teach all other companies to partner with Seagen instead of using ADC. This is what all other big pharma is doing like Roche, Merck, etc. You partner with Seagen early, and just have to pay small royalty fees. But if you sue and lose, then they should come for your neck and business.Daiichi already has 1 strike against them with the PTAB ruling. Next will be arbitration ruling before end of year, anytime after 10/15/2021. If that is strike 2, then Daiichi and more importantly, Astrazeneca needs to think very carefully before going to battle in court and a very high percentage with strike 3. I foresee wiser heads will prevail, and a huge settlement will be met. Seagen needs to make it a very high price to pay to teach everyone else an example."
"Piper Sandler analyst Joseph Catanzaro raised the firm's price target on Seagen to $165 from $160 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results saw solid commercial performance and beats for the lead trio of products, but a neutral stance remains warranted in the absence of better visibility and conviction around what could drive the next inflection, the analyst tells investors in a research note."
FWIW--Lowest volume since 12-24-2020 pre Christmas eve.

@Anonymous & @atpl1959 - So the 15th has come and gone. Should we be hearing something from somebody next week? tia
"We all need to keep in mind that about one year ago (Oct 18, 2020 to be precise), Merck stepped up to buy 5 million SGEN shares at $200/ share. MRK may soon get a positive return on that investment beyond the drug development features of the deal.....and MRK is getting a thorough look at SGEN from the inside....so there remains the possibility of ""additional activity"" between the companies."
