"A new phase 3 trial for Tucatinib. If there was a gap, I think we closed it. Best case scenario imo is we consolidate around $80 for a couple of weeks and go up with Tucatinib pivotal trial results and/or good earnings report. Many stocks of good companies in biotech have been cut in half or worse (ALXN, BMRN, BGNE, INCY, etc., just to mention some of the other BB's large holdings) so I'm feeling pretty good about SGEN right now.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seattle-genetics-announces-initiation-phase-120000248.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/seattle-genetics-announces-initiation-phase-120000248.html"
Curious to see what the PT will be after this announcement. This was not factored in before the last CC. Have to see what the analysts come up with now?!
"$200 per share: SGEN and Merck partnership - Merck invests $1.6 billion in SGEN @ $200 per shareBOTHELL, Wash. & KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGEN) and Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced two new strategic oncology collaborations.The companies will globally develop and commercialize Seattle Genetics’ ladiratuzumab vedotin, an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting LIV-1, which is currently in phase 2 clinical trials for breast cancer and other solid tumors. The collaboration will pursue a broad joint development program evaluating ladiratuzumab vedotin as monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and other LIV-1-expressing solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, Seattle Genetics will receive a $600 million upfront payment and Merck will make a $1.0 billion equity investment in 5.0 million shares of Seattle Genetics common stock at a price of $200 per share. In addition, Seattle Genetics is eligible for progress-dependent milestone payments of up to $2.6 billion.Separately, Seattle Genetics has granted Merck an exclusive license to commercialize TUKYSA (tucatinib), a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers, in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Seattle Genetics will receive $125 million from Merck as an upfront payment and is eligible for progress-dependent milestones of up to $65 million.“Collaborating with Merck on ladiratuzumab vedotin will allow us to accelerate and broaden its development program in breast cancer and other solid tumors, including in combination with Merck’s KEYTRUDA, while also positioning us to leverage our U.S. and European commercial operations,” said Clay Siegall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Seattle Genetics. “The strategic collaboration for TUKYSA will help us reach more patients globally and benefit from the established commercial strength of one of the world’s premier pharmaceutical companies.”“These two strategic collaborations will enable us to further diversify Merck’s broad oncology portfolio and pipeline, and to continue our efforts to extend and improve the lives of as many patients with cancer as possible,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, President, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with the team at Seattle Genetics to advance the clinical program for ladiratuzumab vedotin, which has shown compelling signals of efficacy in early studies, and to bring TUKYSA to even more patients with cancer around the world.”"
"Maurizio I just reviewed the docket from the Texas patent litigation.They did have the Claim construction hearing.As of yesterday the parties were given 7 days to redact any portions of the hearing transcript before making it public.I did review both parties briefs on the claims at issue. Highly technical stuff on issue of definition of drug moeity, and whether the linker is self immolative or non self immolative. All beyond my level of comprehension.From my untrained perspective Seagen basic position was that anyone trained in the field would understand the plain meaning of the terms in SGs patent, while DS was arguing the terms of the patent were defined sufficiently therefore their adc falls outside the patent.SGs seemed better constructed while DS got a bit petty at one point and even somewhat comical at one point trying recreate a definition for when the drug separates from the linker spacer to get around the patents definition.Anyway, way beyond my knowledge for drug construction and patent law.The judge has his own technical advisor on the issues, an attorney in Houston.In short, nothing from the judge which is impacting what’s happening today. By the appearance of a slew of new posters it looks like the short term shorts are back."
"From Morgan Stanley:We expect SGEN higher off a broad revenue beat across key products Adcetris (+7%), Padcev (+7%) and Tukysa (+11%). Mgt. deferred raising guidance as it looks for the momentum to be confirmed in 3Q. Daiichi arbitration, CD40 data and revenue momentum are key 2H drivers.COMPANY DATASeagen Inc(SGEN.O, SGEN US)Biotechnology|United States of AmericaStock Rating Equal-weightIndustry View In-LinePrice target $167.00Shr price, close (Jul 29, 2021) $146.95Mkt cap, curr (mm) $26,62052-Week Range $213.94-133.20Total revenues beat by ~9%: 2Q21 total revenues beat expectations (~$388M vs. ~$357M cons). Sales of Adcetris and Padcev beat by ~7% while Tukysa beat by ~11%.2021 guidance maintained. Guidance remains unchanged from Apr. 29 consisting of Adcetris sales of $675–700M, Padcev $310–325M, Tukysa $300–315M, royalty revenues $125–135M, collaboration/license agreement revenues < $20M, COGS $270–300M, R&D $900–1,000M, SG&A $650–725M, and non-cash expenses $225–245M.Key takeaways: (1) On Adcetris, mgt. noted that the positive results of 5-year ECHELON-1 data may finally be driving increased front-line share. Mgt. remains focused on a potential combination with OPDIVO that could broaden the range of indications into solid tumors; (2) On Padcev, mgt. indicated that while the drug has achieved strong penetration, additional approvals likely drove incremental share; (3) On Tukysa, it is now the most used therapy in second and later line HER2+ patients with brain metastasis. Mgt. highlighted that global expansion, especially in Europe, could drive sales momentum into 2H; (4) With regard to label expansion, mgt. expects to complete enrollment for the PhII pivotal MOUNTAINEER trial in patients with metastatic CRC by YE21, and continues to enroll patients for metastatic gastric cancer; (5) On other programs, mgt. continues to enroll a basket trial for ladiratuzumab vedotin in patients with solid tumors. A PhI trial evaluating SEA-CD40 (in combination with anti-PD-1/chemo) in patients with pancreatic cancer has completed enrollment with initial data expected this year or next year. Mgt. also pointed out their continuing efforts in combining ADCs with immune therapies in the future; (6) On arbitration with Daiichi Sankyo, the arbitration was held in June, with final result expected this year. Mgt. reiterated its confidence in its position.Strong quarter, waiting for 3Q for clearer guidance: We see pipeline progress and continued sales momentum as the key drivers of SGEN into 2H."

FWIW--ESMO conference starts today. SGEN will have 16 presentations which should provide additional insight into future pipeline. The most important will be on Sunday regarding TV combos with Carbooplatin and or Pembro for treating Cervical cancer. The dance around $150 price continues. Hopefully good news will power stock through this barrier. GLTL.

Sold a little today. May buy it back under $150
I have been a shareholder in SGEN for many years. The presentation at JPM was the best presentation ever including all previous quarterly or annual conference calls.
"SGEN's business model is patterned after AMZN's model: do not concern yourself with earnings as long as you grow potential revenue streams. I came to that realization about a year ago when SGEN, on the cusp of ""finally about to being able to report earnings"" took a pass and chose instead to add new indications, new drugs and new business partners all of which served to push any reporting of earnings further into the future. By reporting earnings, drug discovery, R & D and other business building tactics would have to be put off as an expense control measure; by doing the opposite, the drug portfolio/ pipeline is allowed to grow faster and the company can gain ""first mover"" advantage across a wider spectrum of opportunities.....and that's what moves the stock.Clay has taken an important page from Jeff Bezos and should be complimented on seeing the bigger picture."
"Siegall's filing could be the reason for the drop and I am not terribly concerned about it. He did sell 50,000 shares, considerably more than the 29,353 shares he usually sells once a month. Hopefully, he is just buying a mansion somewhere. I would be much more concerned if BB were selling."
"Yeah Mobes, it’s a shame when the board gets polluted by those who can’t respect the rights of others trying to keep the board relevant."
I can't help but notice that DSNKY keeps making new lows while Sgen appears to be breaking out. There could be other reasons and Sgen had a very good quarter but perhaps Clay has good reasons to feel confident about the Arbitration case and something has leaked.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SGEN/chart?p=SGEN#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-
"Adcetris and HIV: Summary of SGEN’s presentation and Q&A during today’s J.P. Morgan conference in San Francisco:- Headline: SGEN is moving toward a clinical trial of Adcetris in HIV. - First, however: There was no mention whatsoever during the presentation or the Q&A of today’s 6 percent drop in share price or any possible cause. FWIW, others are saying that many biotechs slipped today due to the lack of big M&A deals during this conference - so far. If you were disturbed by today’s price action, listening to this presentation is the cure.- Overview 1: Once again, SGEN was given a prime-time slot during a major investor conference. No more early morning or late evening slots. SGEN presented today at 2:30 p.m. local time in San Francisco. It was difficult to tell through a webcast, but many analysts apparently were in attendance.- Overview 2: Not very much new…news, but CEO Clay Siegall’s presentation and the accompanying graphics combined to create very strong summaries of extraordinarily impressive data on all three products: Adcetris, PADCEV and Tucatinib.- Adcetris-HIV. The company has detected compelling evidence that Adcetris may be effective in HIV patients who DO NOT have cancer. Clinical trials in non-cancer HIV patients are being strongly considered.- Siegall on Adcetris in general: Adcetris is a workhorse across 73 countries, with more than 60,000 patients being treated thus far.- Siegall made a point of praising his company’s organizational structure and performance for repeatedly beating PDUFA dates.- During the Q&A, a good bit of detail emerged on marketing plans (separate sales force) for PADCEV and the commercial build-out for Tucatinib. Also, there was much discussion of FDA’s request that SGEN provide Tucatinib to patients under an EAP, even as the FDA rules on the NDA. This has to be a good leading indicator of approval, imo.- Siegall on the possibility of acquiring another company: “We do evaluate other companies regularly. We do a good job of diligence. I would expect at some point, we will acquire another company, but I wouldn’t say it’s imminent at this time. It could be soon or it could be later, but it has to be a first in class or a best in class. I can’t see us acquiring another company to buy the fourth of something unless we can see it becoming the best in class.”- Siegall on the possibility of SGEN being acquired: Who knows? As usual, none of the analysts asked the question foremost in the minds of many investors.As always, I may have missed something. I urge you to listen to the presentation and Q&A when SGEN or others post the replays."
"Padcev reception said to be ""rapid and robust."" From a Seeking Alpha biotech newsletter: ""Finally, we have Piper Sandler raising its price target on Seattle Genetics (SGEN) twenty bucks a share to $155 while maintaining its Overweight rating on the stock. Sandler's analyst 'checks with key opinion leaders indicates early Padcev adoption appears to have been ""rapid and robust and suggestive of a potentially strong top-line beat."" Physician experience at this early stage appears relatively consistent with the clinical trial experience and Seattle Genetics net pricing guidance.' """
"Everyone here is familiar with SG purchase of Cascadian and how it led to the rapid approval of tucatinib/ Tukysa. I was just reading some recent studies about another drug SG obtained in that Cascadian deal, PX-478.While tested as a cancer drug by Cascadian it didn’t prove to be overly efficacious. Basically it’s a drug that blocks HIF-1, which is a protein which is displayed on immune cells, T cells, functioning in a hypoxic environment such as the kidneys, which causes increased inflammation and damage.Recently some scientists at Yale have shown that this drug blocks and reverses the kidney damage of lupus in mice. They also showed that human lupus nephritis patients have the same HIF-1 increase.Lupus nephritis occurs in 50-60% of lupus patients. ( 5M worldwide).Who knows, that Cascadian purchase may prove even bigger than just Tukysa."

"Bank of America upgrades SGEN to Buy from Neutral ahead of 'catalyst-rich' 2021. Price target raised from $205 to $215. Sees significant growth driven by pipeline development and a move toward profitability in 2021. This is significant insofar as, historically, BOA analysts have not been particularly bullish about SGEN."
"If you either listened to the call or read the transcript, it is very obvious that SGEN is making excellent progress, has its collective act together and has several irons in the fire. I couldn't help but note that they acknowledged that they have several things ""in the lab"" that they're working on upon which they feel it is too premature to discuss at this time. Given their track record over the past decade, I think they're developing a few other meaningful compounds.At one time, I must confess that I was trying to look for an earnings pathway....but, over time, I have come to accept that drug development is the name of the game as long as they have the cash to continue on that path; if they reduced or halted their large R & D programs, they'd be able to drop a majority of their generated revenues to the earnings line but there's really little need to so so at the risk of compromising their excellent platform at the present time.The share price volatility we see is symptomatic of a high growth company so I've learned to live with it....and stay focused on the drug discovery, roll outs and revenue generation."
"ASCO/SGEN news alert. Following up on my analysis of a promising media-related comment last week by CEO Clay Siegall: SGEN's release of deep data related to enfortumad vedotin and urothelial cancer is listed as one of the five premier news events of Monday's ASCO session. The news embargo lifts at 7:30 a.m. EDT Monday and the press briefing runs from 9 a.m.-10 a.m. EDT Monday. There is an excellent chance that details of the EV report already have been shared with some reporters on the condition that their reports remain embargoed until Monday. So, if everyone plays by the rules, we very well may see significant media coverage of SGEN and EV before the market opens Monday. Here is how the report is described on the official ASCO media site: ""Results of enfortumab vedotin monotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer previously treated with platinum and immune checkpoint inhibitors."""

We are slightly above consensus on Adcetris at$169M (+$6M) and Tukysa at $72M (+$4M), while remaining in line on our Padcevforecast at $72M. We see total revenue above consensus at $338M (+$2M) and EPS at-$0.56 (+$0.03). With the fourth commercial product, tisotumab vedotin (TV), on trackfor approval this year (10/10/21 PDUFA) and coming label expansions to raise the ceilingfor current products, particularly Padcev, we remain bullish on the prospect for longerterm outperformance from Seagen.• Discussion of the impact of rare occurrences of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) onthe Padcev trajectory will likely be front and center. Our recent KOL discussionsuggested that physicians are likely to view the benefits of Padcev as outweighingthe risk of SJS given its rare nature and the ability to screen out patients who are athigher risk.• We would expect preparations for the recently filed TV launch to be a point ofdiscussion as well as ladiratuzumab vedotin (LV) and the potential impact of thesetwo programs on the overall revenue profile.COVID-19 impact on Adcetris should also be discussed, given the previously notedimpact on diagnosis and also the recent publication of 5-year follow up data in HL."
"Tucatinib data coming out tomorrow are pretty crucial imho. Expectations are very high but I think SGEN will not disappoint.https://www.pharmacytimes.com/conferences/san-antonio-breast-cancer-symposium/five-key-studies-at-the-san-antonio-breast-cancer-symposium-2019-conference5,4,3,2...1.

"In This week Barron’s, an analyst picked SGEN as not only for its vast products in its pipeline but also for a potential takeover target. Buy more on the dip."
Evercore ISI has set up its list of key catalysts for the rest of 2021 in the biotechnology sector - including early-stage data readouts as well as some important legal and regulatory updates ahead for particular companies.And Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) is awaiting a decision on its dispute with Daiichi over a terminated collaboration; royalties for Seagen on Daiichi's ADCs would mean boosts to the stock target price of $15-$30.
FWIW---I am looking forward with great anticipation to the 3rd quarter earnings report which I think will be very positive with respect to revenues across the board and continued progress in our large number of drug trials. What I am really looking for is some positive news on the CD-40 trial for Pancreatic cancer which could be a massive game changer as there has not been much progress in treating this disease.

We are now a multi-product company.”- Approval came only 26 months after the first patient was enrolled in a clinical trial.- The PADCEV sales force is in place and trained “and we are ready to turn PADCEV over to physicians and patients.”- The sale force has an average of 14 years in cancer-treatment experience- “Our next goal is to move PADCEV into frontline. A trial begins in the first half of 2020.”- Initial patient population could be (only) 2,000-4,000 per year, but that will grow. Siegall: “Give us a little latitude here. This is the first drug of its kind to treat bladder cancer. We came up with what we think is a fair population. It is possible for doctors to use this in different ways. It’s a very active drug. We will update you on the number as we learn more.” [He’s suggesting considerable off-label use.]- The projected wholesale cost is $110,000-$120,000 for a course of therapy - not per year, but for the entire course of therapy. Discounts will reduce the net price. “We are committed to assuring large patient access [with discounts and other allowances].”- An analyst implied that was lower than expected. Siegall: “We feel this is a right price. It’s a strong price, but we see it as appropriate.”- The combination of a modest initial patient population, the lower-than-expected “appropriate cost” and some verbal fumbling of the company’s explanations placed Siegall and his team on the defensive and likely contributed to or caused the diminished gain in the opening share price.- Net earnings could reach $90,000 per course of therapy.- SGEN also sees a major opportunity for PADCEV in lung cancer, with a possible reach of 100,000 new patients a year.- PADCEV likely will have many other applications. Trials in other solid tumors will come in 2020.- I had to leave the call around 9:35 a.m. EST and likely missed other news."
"Just listened to the CC from this morning.I know there are some of us that have been around here for many years. Until today, I must admit, I never looked at LV , or LIV1a program as we used to call it, very favorably. Of all of our long term pipeline drugs I never thought this one held much in the way of potential commercial success.I don’t know whether it’s tinkering with the dosing schedule, finding the right combo drug like Keytruda, or both, but this LV program obviously has great potential.Now I’ve listened to Clay enough to feel comfortable with reading between the ultra conservative lines and get a feel for what he is unable to say. It seems obvious to me that this very lucrative Merck deal is valued much more on what hasn’t yet been disclosed but is occurring within the current LV/ Keytruda trials and that with “ diligence “ both SG and Merck are aware. I’m expecting some very exciting data in the future."
"SGEN08:02 05/01/20Guggenheim upgrades Seattle Genetics to Buy on 40% sales growth potentialGuggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt upgraded Seattle Genetics to Buy from Neutral with a $175 price target. The analyst has increased conviction in the commercial potential of recently launched Tukysa in HER2+ cancers and Padcev in urothelial cancers. Despite a strong initial launch quarter for Padcev, the Street still underestimates the overall commercial potential of ""these clinically validated agent with clear visibility and pathway to address larger market opportunities,"" Schmidt tells investors in a research note. Seattle Genetics now markets three commercial products, says the analyst, who forecasts annual sales growth of 40% through 2025, which he believes makes it a ""uniquely positioned growth story in Biotech"
Yeah... the earnings was a downer but I’m more interested in the news of the drugs in their pipeline. That’s all future growth potential. Hope we some positive news in Q1.
"From Morgan Stanley:We like the deal as it gives mgt. a solid mid-stage asset at a reasonable price. Given that the ADC uses Seagen's linker technology, we see the execution risk as low. Despite competitive activity with HER2, combinations and mUC activity suggest reasonable commercial potential.COMPANY DATASeagen Inc(SGEN.O, SGEN US)Biotechnology|United States of AmericaStock Rating Equal-weightIndustry View In-LinePrice target $167.00Shr price, close (Aug 6, 2021) $160.99Mkt cap, curr (mm) $29,16352-Week Range $213.94-133.20Seagen to license HER2 ADC from RemeGen: Mgt. will pay $200M upfront, up to $2.4B in milestones and high single digit to mid-teens percentage royalties in exchange for global rights (excl. Asia, but including Japan and Singapore) for RemeGen's RC48 (disitamab vedotin). RC48 is a HER2 ADC that is quickly internalized using the same ADC platform as Seagen. In June 2021, Disitamab vedotin was approved by the China NMP for gastric cancer. Trials in other solid tumor types, including mUC and HER2 Breast Cancer (including HER2 low) are ongoing. RemeGen is covered by Sean Wu. See inside for existing data and on-going trials.Key potential differentiating factors: Mgt. believe that its high affinity and increased internalization rate may differentiate Disitamab vedotin from other HER2-targeted ADCs. Importantly, like other vedotin targeted ADCs, mgt. sees a clear potential to combine with PD-1 (which may be more challenging for other ADCs with different chemo payloads). Further, mgt. highlighted that it was previously contractually unable to pursue HER2 as a target, but now can and sees today's deal as a way to accelerate its HER2 ADC pipeline using an asset which shares its internal platform.Development plan and regulatory approach: Mgt. indicated that it would prioritize mUC and breast cancer given the overlap with its existing assets and the available data. Importantly, while there is an approval in China mgt. will need to generate additional data to file the agent in the US. We would expect another trial would be necessary even with the existing China data. We await further updates from mgt. on its full development plan.Solid deal that expands mid-stage pipeline: We think this is a good deal for mgt. Activity in HER2-low and mUC can drive a reasonable commercial profile, coupled with the fact that a PD-1 combination could prove to be a significant differentiator. Despite some investor fears that the deal signals a lack of progress in mgt.'s own internal pipeline, we see it as a reasonable way to expand the pipeline. Clarity on the regulatory plan and time to market should be the next key drivers."

"Seattle Genetics (SGEN) PT Raised to $135 at Needham & Company, Following Approval of Bladder Cancer DrugDecember 19, 2019 2:27 PM EST Send to a FriendNeedham & Company analyst Chad Messer raised the price target on Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ: SGEN) to $135.00 (from $130.00) while ... And according to yahoo finance, 802 Jan 17, 2020 $145 calls traded today @$1.05 (last price.), so whoever bought those calls thinks stock will be higher than $146 by then, though I guess it could be a hedge of some kind.Stock was at $52 on Dec 21, 2018 and SGEN's market cap is now $20B. I thought we would be even higher by now but I did not know the estimated initial patient population for EV was between 2,000 and 4,000. Unless you are a trader and love roller coaster rides, a little consolidation before the next catalyst, which should be the Tucatinib filing or perhaps some news regarding the Daiichi dispute, is to be expected and would a be a good thing imo.Happy Holidays!"
Any news ?????? Market is green and SGEN is going red ?????
"NEWS: Intriguing highlights of today’s SGEN analyst presentationHeadlines: “EV is the real deal…about to head to market” and there will be significant media coverage. Adcetris growth is stronger than generally believed. More acquisitions from SGEN are likely.CEO Clay Siegall spent 30 minutes speaking this morning at the RBC Capital Markets healthcare conference in New York City. The format was Q&A with a moderator. Siegall spoke reasonably well, though with the usual nervous tic of frequent, loud throat clearing. Here are the highlights:He was amazingly bullish on Enfortumab Vedotin (EV). Saying that SGEN is working hard on its FDA application and, rather…confidently…that EV is “just about to head to the market.”“We are changing from a single product company to a multi-product company with operations around the globe.”More direct quotes: “EV is the real deal, This is a drug that really, really helps patients. In bladder cancer, the standard of care has been a platinum regimen…. You get about a 45 to 50 percent response rate and half those patients relapse. We have a 44 percent response rate with a single agent, not a regimen. In phase 1, we had a 41 percent response rate; in pivotal, we had a 44 percent response rate.”“Bladder cancer is the fifth largest cancer. It’s an important market.”“We’re on the cusp of becoming a multi-product oncology company. Data are VERY Strong. We are working to assemble the approval for EV as our second product. We’re working on relapsed, frontline and many different settings for EV.”“At ASCO, we will have a feature presentation and there will be a lot of press on EV for sure, based on what I already know.”From me, redhot47fla: Media and media relations are my field, so let me explain that last comment. As SGEN veterans know, the company’s media outreach has been utterly pathetic in the past and present. But Siegall is suggesting here that the company has managed to attract significant media attention already for EV as a treatment for bladder cancer, and it likely has shared or plans to share embargoed data and interviews with major media outlets. Those stories likely will be released on the day that SGEN presents the data at ASCO. We could - could - be looking at major coverage in the NYTimes, Wall Street Journal or other wide-ranging media outlets.Next up will be a frontline application for EV. “We’re very excited about going into the frontline setting with this product. We are really hot on the case of frontline urothelial cancer. We think we have a real chance to set a new standard.”Adcetris: About 55,000 patients have been treated with Adcetris. “We are sitting back with Adcetris being a fantastic and growing product.”He reiterated guidance of $610-$640 million in U.S. sales this year. “There will be substantial growth this year.” He also said Adcetris very likely will pass $1 billion in sales on a global basis this year, clocking in at $1.1-$1.2 billion around the world.He talked more about the seasonality of Adcetris sales, which negatively impacts first-quarter sales. (A factor the company didn’t get around to mentioning in its earnings release, to our detriment.)“It’s a little hard with cancer products. There is some seasonality with cancer products. The first quarter is always difficult. You can delay your therapy until after the holidays and push it off.“if you look at it historically, our second quarters are always very strong. We feel very good about our growth rate with Adcetris.”“As our data keeps on aging and we’re putting out at ASCO some [new] data…, the data between our product and the standard of car is getting wider [showing greater advantage with Adcetris]. As our data is aging, it’s improving.”The RBC moderator said that his people have found that many doctors learned about Adcetris from a press release rather than from medical meetings. This goes to the sense here and elsewhere that SGEN’s sales force is not…vigorous.Siegall pushed back: “We felt that we were out there in force. We have increased our sales force by 50 percent [after getting frontline approval]…. We do not think our sales people were not out in force. It was just the seasonality of the year. Keep an eye on us. We feel that things very much are on track.“The moderator asked about new acquisitions. Siegall: “We’ve always been very careful at looking at opportunities to bring in promising products. We continue to look at other companies out there. I would be surprised if over the next two years we do not make other acquisitions.”That’s all I have. By my standard, it was an unusually newsy presentation, though perhaps not fully by design."
The news continues to be very good. I have been in this stock since late 2006 and will keep holding. The news with MRK is incredible as they are a very respectable firm and add a huge amount of validation with their large cash injection!
"Good setup for 2021 and pipeline progressIn our view, there was a lot to like about Seagen’s largely in-line quarter with a slightEPS miss (-$0.08 vs. cons.) on increased expenses. In the context of an earnings seasonthat has been characterized by weak results, we'd argue that Seagen held up remarkablywell for a quarter in which the COVID-19 surge pressured the healthcare system as awhole. Product sales guidance for the three commercial franchises was reiterated, whichwe think is beatable, particularly given the lack of negative impact to Padcev from rarederm adverse events disclosed during the quarter. The Seagen bull story remains intact,in our view, as the pipeline picks up steam with commercial product #4 on the way intisotumab vedotin (TV), under review for metastatic cervical cancer, a 5th (ladiratuzumabvedotin, LV) in phase 2 development, and label expansion studies under way for Padcevand Tukysa even as they continue their initial launches. We think these factors,combined with an emerging early pipeline, profitability on the horizon, and increasingcapacity to supplement the platform with business development combine to give Seagena compelling risk/reward profile. Reiterate Buy and $210 PO.Pipeline UpdatesFDA accepted the BLA for TV in cervical cancer with Priority Review, setting a PDUFAOct 10th. The agency also accepted (with Priority Review) two sBLAs for Padcev (PDUFAAug 17th), one which would convert the initial accelerated approval to regular and onethat would further expand the indication in mUC in the platinum-ineligible population.Two new studies for Tukysa have initiated: the phase 3 CompassHER2 RD trialevaluating drug in combo with Kadcyla in the HER2+ adjuvant breast cancer and a phase2 combination with Herceptin in metastatic solid tumors carrying HER2 alterations."
"From B of A this morningSeveral avenues to upside from hereIn the wake of our upgrade and conservative 2021 guidance, we wanted to evaluatescenarios that could drive the next re-rating for SGEN shares. Seagen’s pipeline offerssignificant value with TV and LV likely to be Seagen’s 4th and 5th approved products(2021e and 2022e) and the earlier pipeline showing promise, but here we evaluate thepotential impact of label expansions for the primary growth drivers, Padcev and Tukysa.While the current profiles are well appreciated, especially after the presentations atASCO GU, the upside from additional tumor types could be robust. Our base case implies33% upside from current levels and a bull case scenario for Tukysa and Padcev coulddrive even more meaningful upside, 67% in our analysis. In addition to robust growthfrom Tukysa and Padcev, we think Seagen’s stable Adcetris business and deep pipelinemake for an attractive risk/reward profile. Maintain Buy and $210 POLarger addressable populations could raise the ceilingWe model Tukysa in HER2+ breast cancer, though there is potential in other HER2+tumor types, with colorectal cancer data from the pivotal phase 2 MOUNTAINEER studyexpected by YE21. If colorectal cancer was added to the Tukysa label, we could see~4,000 incremental US patients on therapy, and >$1B in incremental peak revenues,which would be worth ~$25/sh. For Padcev, we model the approved 2L+ urothelialcarcinoma indication as well as in 1L therapy (pending data from EV-103 cohort K,enrollment complete by year end 2021). In a Padcev bull case, with higher 1L penetration(50% peak from 30%) and approval in other solid tumors adding another ~4,000 USpatients between the 6 indications in EV-202, we would expect >$900M in incrementalUS revenue, worth ~$30/sh. If both scenarios were to play out, we could see ~$55/sh ofupside, roughly 67% above the current price of $159. Conversely, a bear case with no 1LPadcev, 35% peak Padcev penetration, 25% peak Tukysa penetration (from 50%), and nopipeline value beyond TV/LV would be ~$60/sh downside from our base case."
"Although the recent decline doesn't exactly agree with this thought, I'll state it anyway. With regard to the near-mid term financial impacts on the various segments of the economy, and therefor on the investment segments as well, as a result of the Coronavirus, I would think that the biotech world would be somewhat of a safe harbor. After all, cancer will continue on unabated (unfortunately), trials will continue on unabated, success or failure will be unaffected, FDA approvals with success will be unaffected, and the resultant commercialization should be unaffected, all leading to an unaffected valuation. Now politics, that's something else altogether."
"IF....SGEN has been falling because the CO has sold his option shares then I would say he did what is allowed legally unless proven otherwise...It is better than AMERICA's ""SO-CALLED"" CEO who has been lying, breaking laws, aiding enemies for self gain, stealing election...and on and on...Have no fear there are some on this board who LOVE to focus on SGEN only would bring the stock back up once they start focusing again...LOL"
"SGEN ESMO901O - EV-103: Initial results of enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (ID 4844) Presentation Number901OLecture Time09:15 - 09:30SpeakersChristopher J. Hoimes (Cleveland, United States of America) Abstract BackgroundPlatinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients (pts) with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC). Despite the use of first-line (1L) PD-1/PD-1L inhibitors, 71–76% of pts who are cisplatin-ineligible do not respond. EV is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, which is highly expressed in mUC. EV monotherapy data are encouraging; combination therapy may provide additional benefit. Here, we report initial data on a cohort of cis-ineligible pts receiving 1L EV + pembrolizumab.MethodsThis phase 1b study (NCT03288545) evaluated the safety/activity of EV + pembrolizumab. In the dose-escalation cohort, 1L or 2L pts received 1.0 or 1.25?mg/kg EV?+?200?mg pembrolizumab. Cohort A pts received the recommended dose of 1.25?mg/kg EV + pembrolizumab as 1L therapy. In each 21-day cycle, EV was administered on Days 1 and 8 and pembrolizumab on Day 1. The primary endpoint was safety/tolerability; key secondary objectives: recommended EV dose, antitumor activity, DCR, DOR, PFS, and OS.ResultsAs of 20 Feb 2019, 29 la/mUC pts (median 68 [51–90] y; 31% liver metastasis, 17% ECOG 2) have been treated with EV (1.25?mg/kg) + pembrolizumab in the 1L setting and completed at least 2 post-baseline scans or discontinued treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) were fatigue (66%, 14% =Grade 3), decreased appetite (52%, 0% =Grade 3), alopecia (45%), and diarrhea (41%, 3% =Grade 3). Among AE of clinical interest, rash of any type occurred in 45% of pts (14% =Grade 3), peripheral neuropathy of any type in 52% (3% =Grade 3), and 17% experienced immune-mediated events that required systemic steroid treatment (10% =Grade 3). Overall, 2 pts (7%) discontinued treatment with EV + pembrolizumab due to AE (lipase increase,multi-organ failure). Preliminary confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 62% by investigators, including a 14% CR rate. The DCR was 90%.ConclusionsIn 1L cis-ineligible pts with la/mUC, EV + pembrolizumab demonstrates encouraging efficacy with a tolerable and manageable safety profile. Further evaluation of this combination is warranted. Updated data, including responses pending confirmation, will be available at the meeting.Clinical trial identificationNCT03288545.Editorial acknowledgementHeather Brignull, PhD of Seattle Genetics.Legal entity responsible for the studySeattle Genetics, Inc.FundingSeattle Genetics, Inc.

Golden cross. It may indicate a major rally is on the horizon.
I think you mean patience.
"from b of a this morning. Huge report here are some sgen highlightsSeagen (SGEN)With 1Q earnings season ramping up next week, we’ve taken a closer look at the latestcompetitive dynamics across the highest-impact oncology markets in Biopharma, rangingfrom solid tumors (including lung, RCC, bladder, melanoma, and breast cancers) tohematology (myeloma, CLL, cHL, DLBCL). Our analysis leverages proprietary IQVIABrandImpact market share data (U.S. only) through March, which highlights continueduptake of I/O agents and targeted therapies across all treatment landscapes. We wouldn’tsay there were any major surprises in the data, but from a new entry perspective, someagents are tracking above expectations early into their launches, which could promptupside both in 1Q but importantly to peak numbers: including 1) Bristol’s Opdivo/Yervoyin 1L lung (8% 1L share); 2) Seagen’s Padcev in 2L+ bladder (38% share); and 3) Gilead’sTrodelvy in 2L+ triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), with 35% 2L+ share despite onlybeing approved for 3L+ patients. Outside of new launches, most of the analyzed marketsremained largely stable throughout the quarter, with continued dominance from Pfizer’sIbrance in metastatic breast, Bristol’s Revlimid in myeloma, and AbbVie’s Imbruvica in CLL.Additionally, strong launches from Seagen’sPadcev (bladder) and Gilead’s Trodelvy (TNBC) in 2L+ settings bodes well for 1Q numbers.Our NPV sum of the parts valuation gives a price objective of $210 for SGEN, whichincludes $67/share for Adcetris, $47/sh for Padcev (enfortumab vedotin), $34/sh forTukysa (tucatinib), $13/sh for tisotumab vedotin, $9/sh for ladiratuzumab vedotin, $1/shfor collaborations, $14/sh in net cash, and $25/sh for the technology platform. Weassume a WACC of 10% and terminal growth rates for each asset ranging from 0% to2%.Upside risks are faster than expected launches for Padcev and Tukysa as well asincreased uptake in Adcetris in HL. Successful trials from the pipeline could leadinvestors to begin to assign further value to these programs.Downside risks are successful competitor trials and pricing pressure from less expensivealternatives. Disappointing uptake of new product launches could result in lower cashflows and reduced investor confidence in the ADC platform."
"Growth Story Intact with Good 2H UpsidePotential; Thoughts Post the 2Q CallReiterate Rating: BUY | PO: 210.00 USD | Price: 146.95 USDPortfolio to deliver growth from label/geo expansionWe were impressed by Seagen’s 2Q21 print (see our 2Q21 results report), highlighted bya strong and growing underlying base business; we think this should continue in 2H21and into 2022. Despite Seagen’s maintained revenue guidance, we expect that Padcevlabel expansion, Tukysa launch in additional geographies, and potential 4Q21 tisotumabvedotin (TV) approval and launch (2021/2022: $22M/$68M vs. $15M/$68M cons), coulddrive upside total revenue trends in 2021 (BofA: $1.51B; cons: $1.49B; guidance~$1.46B). The Seagen bull thesis was reinforced in our view, with the pipeline hitting itsmarks as Padcev and Tukysa (each 34% 2021-2025 revenue CAGRs) are positioned tomove upstream and into larger patient populations (see our Padcev ASCO report),including 1L metastatic urothelial cancer, bladder cancer, and earlier lines of breastcancer. Meanwhile Adcetris should cement a stable base (13% 2021-2025 CAGR). Withthis in mind, we think the market is underappreciating Seagen’s above average growthprofile, as shares are pricing in bear cases for Tukysa and Padcev. Indeed, we see astrong risk / reward profile in SGEN shares (see our NPV analysis), with a bull scenarioadditional valuation of >$100/sh. Reiterate Buy and $210 PO.Pipeline UpdatesIn addition to receiving full approval of Padcev and an additional indication in locallyadvanced or metastatic urothelial cancer patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-chemo,Seagen highlighted that a 1L combo study with Keytruda is expected to completeenrollment by YE2021. For Tukysa, earlier lines of breast cancer studies are underwayand a pivotal phase 2 colorectal carcinoma study is expected to complete enrollment byYE2021. The TV review remains on track for its October 10th PDUFA.Model ChangesWe have updated our model to reflect reiterated guidance and now forecast 2021 EPSof $(1.99) vs. $(1.95) prior due to increased COGS estimates"
Excellent results in the TV trials for SG. And Genmab.Also Enhertu blew away Kadcyla results in their 2nd line breast ca. Trial. Nice how AZ and DS always reference Enhertu’s strong linker when discussing the drugs efficacy.Should SG prevail in arbitration the valuation analysis should sure be interesting.
I see that someone comes on this board and question SGEN while promote other stocks...MY MESSAGE TO SUCH INDIVIDUAL(S):YOU DON'T BUY SGEN AND SELL IF YOU HAVE A POSITION...IF SGEN IS NOT MEETING YOUR SATISFACTION...I HAVE BEEN IN SGEN SINCE THE START AND ALL MY CURRENT STOCKS ARE FOR FREE...I GOT MY INVESTMENT OUT AND I BELIEVE IN THIS COMPANY 1000000%GO BUY NAUT - AND FOLLOW ANTI-AMERICAN AMAZON...
"from b of a this morningIn the wake of recent share underperformance (-20.1% YTD vs. NBI -6.3%), we thoughtit important to re-examine the fundamentals of Padcev, one of Seagen’s primary valuedrivers. Despite a fast start to its launch, concerns around dermatological AEs postapproval are giving ammunition to the bears, though in our view Padcev’s trajectory ison solid ground. We spoke with an academic medical oncologist to get his perspectiveon Padcev’s expansion potential and the implications of the derm AEs. In our KOL’s view,Padcev is very likely to be approved in earlier lines of therapy and become SoC, with 2Lapproval based on the EV-201 cohort 2, and 1L based on EV-103 cohort K. Our KOLstressed that cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in Padcev patients are extremelyrare events and that the risk can be mitigated by screening for pre-existing seriousautoimmune disease. These AEs will not affect our KOL’s Padcev use, though it couldtake time to educate community physicians to increase their comfort with Padcev. Wecontinue to believe that the combination of label expansions from Padcev and Tukysa aswell as the emerging pipeline should drive outperformance as described in our recentupgrade. Despite the recent downturn, we view the fundamentals as very solid and thinkSGEN shares are particularly attractive at this point. Reiterate Buy and $210 PO.Padcev to be standard of care in earlier lines of therapyOur KOL sees a high likelihood that Padcev will be approved in 2L based on recently filedEV-201 cohort 2 given the higher ORR (52%) than the already impressive 3L ORR incohort 1 (44%) and become standard of care. Similarly, he sees a high (80-85%)probability of positive 1L data (>50% ORR) from EV-103 cohort K (Padcev + Keytruda)."
"I was a little nervous about the Goldman analyst during the last CC and any future price targets. She questioned the modest 10% midst growth guidance for Adcetris, and followed up asking about initial Padcev uptake.The responses seemed to be that perhaps it was time to take a breather with Adcetris while future possible indications arise, after years of stellar growth.As to Padcev, Clay detailed they have identified 3200 centers, 2800 being the largest in dealing with urothelial ca. He stated their sales force has already called on 1500 of those centers. While too early to give any Padcev guidance he did state they have so far vastly exceeded their internal predictions.Bladder ca is a large population and that’s only one of the numerous Nectin 4 expressing cancers. I think this analyst from GS may believe that SG was purposely conservative in their guidance but that Padcev will more than make up for any lag in Adcetris growth."
"comments made yesterday by GS on 21 M and AWith an estimated ~$530B war chest in total, large biopharma companies will continue to drive M&A activity in 2021, the analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted in a new analysis of the sector.Noting a ~110% YoY rise in deal volumes in February including ~221% YoY growth in U.S. mid-cap deals, the analysts expect that given a favorable environment, the M&A activity could follow the trend set in 2H 2020.Merck, Pfizer Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sanofi, and GlaxoSmithKline are likely to be at the forefront of M&A activity, the analysts argue noting the losses of exclusivity hurting the valuations of potential acquirers.Arguing that therapeutic areas remain a priority for many acquirers, the analysts cite oncology and immunology as areas where many companies are exposed to, with a rising interest in neurology and compelling valuation of “late-stage gene therapy” stocks after recent underperformance.Arvinas, Blueprint Medicines, Incyte, Seagen, Mirati Therapeutics, and Turning Point Therapeutics are highlighted as attractive stocks within oncology space.Karuna Therapeutics and argenx SE are cited as highly compelling candidates in neurology and immunology, respectively."
"Should Roche take a look at SGEN? Has Pola now approved, with high chances of getting first-line by year-end. Then, with SGEN pipeline would have first-line cHL and T-cell, would dominate lymphoma treatment. Then, tucatinib would be complementary for HER2 portfolio and EV for bladder with atezo...mmm...more I think it makes more sense"
"From Morgan Stanley:Arbitration to Decide Ownership Dispute with DaiichiArbitration hearing on who owns certain Daiichi ADC patents is set to begin on June 14. We would expect a ruling within a few weeks from the hearing. If Seagen wins the dispute, we see the potential for 10-30% upside.Seagen and Daiichi Sankyo (covered by Shinichiro Muraoka) are engaged in an arbitration over who owns specific Daiichi patents related to ADC technology. This dispute is significant because Seagen claims that technology and patents concerning ADC products in Daiichi's pipeline, such as Enhertu, U3-1402, DS-1062, and DS-7300, belong to Seagen, not Daiichi. A hearing to decide the arbitration is scheduled to begin on June 14. The arbitrator may then take several weeks to issue a decision. Under one of our scenarios, Seagen wins ownership of these patents and is owed monetary damages for Daiichi's past use of this IP and a 10% running royalty on Enhertu sales for Daiichi's continued use. That outcome would represent ~$23 in equity value/share to Seagen—or ~15% upside to SGEN's most recent closing price. We believe this potential upside is not fully appreciated by the market. We present background on this dispute and identify some potential outcomes."
"Relax all, those of us here since the single digits know the reversal is coming as past performance is a great predicted of future behavior. There is so much on the plate that can turn the tide in an instant. Buyout, frontline for Padcev, TV accelerated approval, the pancreatic cancer efficacy of our early stage candidate, S&P, etc... any catalyst can spark a run and it will yet again. The Quang‘s will be gone, or posting under one of their alter aliases. Relax, take a deep breath, it’s all been seen many, many times before."

"Early Tivdak approval supports solid launchWe continue to like the growth potential from Seagen’s product portfolio (38% 2021-23revenue CAGR; see our 2Q21 results report) after the accelerated approval of tisotumabvedotin (TV; brand name Tivdak), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) partnered withGenmab for treatment of metastatic cervical cancer. The accelerated approval cameearlier than expected (October 10th PDUFA), supporting our above consensusexpectations for the launch of Tivdak (2021/2022: $22M/$76M vs. $12M/$64M cons).Seagen has been hitting all its marks lately, capitalizing on its pipeline and labelexpansion opportunities and positioning the company well to exceed revenueexpectations for 2021/2022 (BofA $1.5B/$2.1B vs. cons $1.5B/$2.2B). We look for thisto continue with the full approval of Padcev, and expansion of the Padcev (see our ASCOreport) and Tukysa labels, including into 1L metastatic urothelial cancer, bladder cancer,earlier lines of breast cancer, and colorectal. We also see the earlier pipeline hitting withsolid ladiratuzumab vedotin data (LV; partnered with Merck) presented in triple negativebreast cancer (TNBC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annualmeeting (see ESMO LV report). We think Seagen’s pipeline opportunities, new productlaunches, label expansion opportunities, and solid Adcetris base (13% 2021-2025 CAGR)position the company well for an above average growth profile, which we continue tosee the market underappreciate. We still like the strong SGEN risk / reward (see our NPVanalysis), with a bull scenario additional valuation of >$100/sh. Maintain Buy & $210 PO.Label and pricing are unlikely to hamper uptakeThe approved label for Tivdak was largely as expected, indicating for treatment ofpatients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on orafter chemotherapy. There is a boxed warning for ophthalmic events that calls for examsbefore every dose, which could be an initial gating factor for uptake. That said, theseevents had been well documented in clinical studies, and furthermore the label providesclear instructions for monitoring and eye care regimen that should make the processsomewhat easier. As for pricing, Tivdak’s estimated $90,000-120,000 list price and~$70,000-90,000 net price are roughly in-line with Seagen’s other ADCs and so shouldnot be a barrier for access. As a reminder, Tivdak is partnered with Genmab. Under thepartnership, Seagen and Genmab will co-promote the drug in the US, with Seagenrecording sales and an equal profit share. OUS, Seagen has commercialization rightseverywhere but Japan. In Europe, China, and Japan the two companies will share profits,and beyond those territories, Seagen will solely commercialize Tivdak and pay Genmab aroyalty in the mid-teens to mid-twenties.Tivdak expansion opportunities in earlier linesThe next step for Tivdak is expansion into earlier lines of metastatic cervical cancer,including in 1L in combination with chemotherapy and/or Keytruda. Data recentlypresented at ESMO, confirmed this opportunity, with Tivdak/chemo achieving ameaningful 55% objective response rate (ORR), 8.3 month duration of response (DoR),and 9.5 month progression free survival (PFS) in 1L and Tivdak/Keytruda achieving 38%,13.8 month DOR and 5.6 months PFS in the 2L/3L setting."

"As someone who has owned and followed this stock since the Mid Single Digits, I am a littlesurprised at how ""unexpected"" the share price volatility has been to some of our long term posters here.Not only our past history confirms this up/down trend, but almost ALL of the biotech sector shows these extremes over short to mid term time frames. And market cap has shown nothing to do with ""stabilization"" in Share Price.Many stocks in this sector have shown VERY similar action to SGEN with Market Cap's triple ours (or more).This is nothing NEW at all and frankly the whining that has taken place here lately ignores the LONG TERM trend that management has set for the company and hence the stock over the last 15 years or so. Could theyhave handled some things better, of course, but this notion that somehow we would have been better off justholding onto the S&P 500 ""SPDRS"" as long term holders is not only laughable, but completely ignores thefacts at hand. If you invest in this sector you should KNOW by now that you have to suffer the valleys inorder to enjoy the peaks that this technology has brought to the share price. Enjoy the weekend andcontinued good luck to my fellow long term longs in this stock!"
Looks like a GREAT Quarter to me and our pipeline is still fantastic.ADC Technology still the future and glad to see it continue to help so many people dealing with this terrible disease.Been here since 2004 and not going anywhere - Good Luck Fellow Longs!!
"Note from MS:And for Seagen, we are slightly ahead on revenues (~2%), but believe investors are more focused on future growth opportunities than the 2021 sales trajectory. We see a decision on arbitration, CD40 data and pipeline growth as the key drivers of SGEN."
"Overall, I thought it was a good earnings call. If SEA-CD30, which I believe is 100% owned, works for pancreatic cancer, it would of course be transformational even for a fairly large, well diversified company like Seagen. Below are comments from Morgan Stanley:Padcev and Adcetris missed marginally while Tukysa beat. Overall, we saw the quarter as uneventful and expect investors to focus on pipeline opportunities. We look to 2H21 for updates on key programs, in particular EV-103 Cohort K, the MOUNTAINEER trial and potential LIV-1.Revenues inline, Tukysa beat: 1Q21 total revenues were broadly inline (~$332M vs. ~$336M cons). Quarterly sales of Adcetris and Padcev both missed by ~4% while Tukysa beat ~15%. Mgt. reiterated 2021: Adcetris net product sales are expected to be between $675M-$700M, Padcev between $310M-$325M, and Tukysa between $300M-$315M. Royalty revenues, driven primarily by Takeda's sales of Adectris, are expected to be between $125M-$135M, and collaboration/licenses agreement revenues are expected to be <$20M.Key takeaways: (1) On Adcetris, mgt. noted that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the HL diagnosis rate, though Adcetris has managed to maintain share in the frontline setting. Mgt. noted that they have received positive feedback from physicians on the 5 year ECHELON data; (2) On Padcev, mgt. expects to present a variety of data at ASCO (see here for all presentations). Of note is an update on EV-103, with durability and long-term outcomes for 1L mUC cis-ineligible patients treated with Padcev plus Keytruda. This readout will be in Cohort A, on which the FDA's original breakthrough therapy designation was based; (3) Separately, mgt. continues to expect to complete enrollment for Cohort K of EV-103 by YE21, and believes filing an sBLA for the frontline mUC setting would be possible in 2022, assuming adequate follow-up; (4) Mgt noted that the update of Padcev's label to include warnings for Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (following cases being observed in the post-marketing observation period) has not been an impediment to adoption by physicians, and has not led to a change in use; (5) On Tukysa, during 1Q21, Tukysa was approved for use in the EU and UK in patients with HER2+ 3L locally advanced or metastatic BC; (6) With regard to label expansion, mgt. expects to complete enrollment for the PhII pivotal MOUNTAINEER trial in patients with metastatic CRC by YE21; (8) On other programs, mgt. continues to enroll a basket trial for ladiratuzumab vedotin in patients with solid tumors, including lung, head and neck, prostate, and esophageal cancers, among others. A PhI trial evaluating SEA-CD30 (in combination with anti-PD-1/chemo) in patients with pancreatic cancer has completed enrollment with initial data expected this year."
"Re Q4 Revenue expectations I see that Yahoo has it at High: $167.2, Avg: $163.7, Low: $155.3. And from the Q3 CC Rev. updates (calculating Royalty & Collaboration based on full year updates with Q3 YTD subtracted out) of $151.5 to $170.5. I recognize other events since may impact these numbers, but this is what I understand to be on the table going in to this CC. Anyone have different info on what's been stated in one form or another?Paladin"
"First, thanks to Redhot...Below is what the December 27, 2019 write up say...27 DEC 2019Seattle Genetics’ (NASDAQ:SGEN) tisotumab vedotin needs to show longer responses in metastatic cervical cancer patients in a Phase II study than those previously seen in Phase I/II data in order to prove clinical significance and potentially support approval, experts said.An analyst noted that early Phase I/II tisotumab efficacy results in cervical cancer patients from innovaTV 201 (NCT02001623) was strong enough to support further development since the objective response rate (ORR) with standard therapies is less than 20%. While experts agreed tisotumab’s ORR was better than available therapies, they emphasized the need for it to cause more durable responses in the ongoing Phase II innovaTV 204 than those seen in innovaTV 201. Even though duration of response (DOR) is not a primary endpoint, one expert said it will likely be considered during approval, given the low tisotumab ORR.The first analyst noted ocular toxicities seen with tisotumab are a key issue, but experts said they will likely be manageable with eye drops and other mitigating measures."
Seagen: The Phase I trial (NCT04254107) evaluating the safety study of SEA-TGT (SGN-TGT) in Advanced Cancer has increase its estimated patient enrollment from 111 to 231 patients.This is a good sign and I believe Clay said SEA-TGT is one of the drugs in the early pipeline he is particularly excited about.

"from b of a againWe continued our 2021 Biopharma CEO/CFO Call Series, with Seagen’s Clay Siegall, CEOand Roger Dansey, CMO (see our call takeaways). Below we’ve highlighted some keyquotes; the call transcript can be accessed in the body of this report.On Padcev opportunity for label expansions“The data that we're presenting at ASCO…is really a remarkable outcome. To think of apopulation where we can potentially generate a progression free survival that is over ayear where the traditional numbers are in the sort of middle-single digits is a remarkableimprovement”“There is a reasonable chance that we will find other tumors that may have a similar sortof sensitivity to PADCEV. So, the basket trial is focusing in on higher expressing Nectin4 tumors and it includes things like lung cancer, breast cancer and GI cancers, bigcancers that we can potentially address”On Padcev’s safety profile “Skin is an on target toxicity. And it's honestly not surprising when you get out into abigger world outside of clinical trials that you may see more events of skin tox. And justas Clay said, we think it's really important that physicians are aware. And so thatawareness going through the Dear Health Care Professional is updating the labelbecause safe use of PADCEV, it's so active and it has such a strong efficacy profile, weneed as safe use as possible.”On Tukysa potential in colorectal cancer“It's well known that HER2 is on a certain percentage of colorectal patients, it's wellknown that HER2 therapies can benefit colorectal patients. So, I don't think our initialdata was unexpected, I think it was surprising how good it was when you combine it withHerceptin.”“We believe that TUKYSA may well be able to help patients, all the way up to frontline.So, we have in place a trial and of course, this is now a trial that is exploringcombinations with chemotherapy, because that's where we think we would need to go.”On potential of the earlier pipeline“For the rest of the TV program, just because the ADC construct allows one to testmultiple tumors where the expression is high and we know TV is an active drug. I mean,we've demonstrated that in cervical cancer, so we're currently exploring other solidtumors.““as hasn't been lost on Merck, and certainly not lost on us is the amazing way that ourVedotin ADCs work with checkpoint inhibitors, and the innate activity of immunogeniccell death and how that sets up working with checkpoints really well.”“TIGIT uses the same technology as our SEA-CD40 or I call S-40. So the TIGIT uses theSEA technology. So once again, we have a unique technology that has at least twofunctions. So, it is different than the standard TIGIT that is being developed”"
"b of a love affair with sgen continuesFuture is bright for PadcevThe development path for additional Padcev indications was a primary focus of the call,particularly in light of the positive data included in yesterday’s ASCO abstracts. Thecombination with Keytruda is a central plank of the strategy, with the potential to moveto the front line as an accelerated approval with cohort K of EV-103 (enrollmentcompletion guided for year end 2021). Beyond the current metastatic urothelialcarcinoma indication, plans to treat earlier stage disease could expand the population,with muscle invasive disease having stable nectin-4 expression and management havinga high expectation for having a meaningful clinical profile. With potential to administerPadcev directly to the bladder in the future, safety could be improved with limitedsystemic exposure, setting up for even earlier stage non-muscle invasive disease.Commercially, Padcev is gaining momentum, with Seagen seeing no real impact in thereal world from rare instances of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, with most physicians notseeing any cases but aware of the potential for these on-target toxicities. Indeed, weanticipate a continued upward trajectory, with 2021 sales of $347M (vs. $322M cons)Tukysa EU launch measured, but making progressSeagen’s commercial organization in the EU is expected to have slower uptake than inthe US as individual reimbursement agreements are negotiated. While noting thatGermany and France offer fast access, the remaining countries in the EU will offeraccess over time. While not expecting EU to add a lot to the revenue profile this year, weremain above consensus on Tukysa at $334M (vs. $313M). The Tukysa commercialfootprint is also positioned to expand with the MOUNTAINEER study ongoing in othertumor types, with the colorectal arm expected to complete approval by year end.TV set to be 4th commercial productThe tisotumab vedotin (TV) launch is expected launch in cervical cancer this fall andbecome Seagen’s 4th product. With high unmet need in this patient population,management is optimistic about TV’s place in the market. In addition, managementbelieves that TV could offer a treatment option in other tissue factor-expressing tumors,with a basket study ongoing in addition to a study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.We think TV expectations remain beatable, with the 2025 revenue consensus at $354M.Early pipeline has promiseManagement touted the depth and potential differentiation of the earlier pipeline,particularly the sugar-engineered antibody (SEA) platform. Particular attention was givento the CD40 program in relapsed/refractory pancreatic cancer, where the SEA programcould impart a different profile compared to competing CD40 programs, potentiallymaking for limited read-through to the SEA-CD40 program. With new programs beingregularly introduced, the SEA platform is becoming an increasingly important part of theSeagen pipeline story, with potentially differentiation in targets like TIGIT and BCMA."
This is possibly why Clay was so excited. This is a great news. Going Global!!!! This deal puts all Big Pharma on alert that SGEN is not sitting around and waiting. Moving forward!!!!
"Re ASCO, biotechs like SGEN back in the spotlight, from BioPharma Dive: ""For the past several years, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology has provided a stage for cancer immunotherapy's rapid rise, documenting major clinical advances made in melanoma, lung cancer and other tumors. That's made the conference indispensable for investors in companies like Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, each a leader in immuno-oncology.This year, however, fewer blockbuster trial results are expected. And both Merck and Bristol-Myers are taking a lower-profile approach, with neither planning to hold investor events for the first time since 2013.Those two companies have been the focus of this conference for the last four or five years,"" said Brad Loncar, CEO of Loncar Investments and a regular attendee of the event, being held from May 31 to June 4. ""They're both quiet as a mouse this year."" Cancer research hasn't slowed down for either drugmaker. For Merck, an R&D event set for later in June made an investor showcase at ASCO unnecessary, while key data for Bristol-Myers' immunotherapy Opdivo won't be available in time. Yet their more subdued presence this year means the spotlight will shine brighter on a number of biotechs scheduled to present data on emerging targeted therapies. ""For the last three to five years, most of ASCO has been dominated by large pharma and it has displaced a lot of the biotechs,"" said SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens in an interview. ""This year the pendulum has swung back."" Drawing early interest this year are Amgen, Seattle Genetics, Blueprint Medicine, Macrogenics and Puma Biotechnology...."

(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., ""Astellas"") and Seagen Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) regular approval in the U.S., in addition to approving a new indication for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and have previously received one or more prior lines of therapy. Cisplatin-ineligible patients typically have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis.PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) 20 mg vial USPADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) 20 mg vial USIn 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval for PADCEV for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery, or in a locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer setting. The conversion from accelerated approval to regular approval and the label expansion were based on two supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program.""The FDA's decision to convert accelerated approval to regular approval was based on data from the Phase 3 EV-301 trial, which had a primary endpoint of overall survival for patients treated with PADCEV versus chemotherapy,"" said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head, Astellas. ""With PADCEV, for the first time, physicians can treat advanced urothelial cancer following treatment with a platinum-containing therapy and immunotherapy using an FDA-approved therapy that has demonstrated an overall survival benefit compared with chemotherapy."""

"The fact that PTAB refused to even listen to Daiichi's challenge to Seagen's IP validity, that is a very bad sign for Daiichi. Basically the patent office says that Daiichi has nothing new and their challenge does not have any merit, and don't waste our time.Now, the arbitration happened on 9/15/2021 with a 30 days follow-up window to reach an agreement between Seagen and Daiichi before 10/15/2021. If that doesn't happen, then I believe the arbitration will issue their ruling any time after that. With the PTAB decision, arbitration will most likely follow the PTAB and rule in favor of Seagen. Next, it will be up to both companies to either settle or head to court on the IP infringement case in 2022. However, if arbitration is ruled in favor of Seagen, then there is very little chance that the court will go against both PTAB and arbitration ruling. I hope if Daiichi is foolish enough to go to court, then Seagen should got to the maximum damage to Daiichi on border of injunction to sell any of their drugs within the IP coverage. If they want to settle after going to court, then they should pay for a very high double digit royalty, court fees, and huge settlement starting at billions. This will teach all other companies to partner with Seagen instead of using ADC. This is what all other big pharma is doing like Roche, Merck, etc. You partner with Seagen early, and just have to pay small royalty fees. But if you sue and lose, then they should come for your neck and business.Daiichi already has 1 strike against them with the PTAB ruling. Next will be arbitration ruling before end of year, anytime after 10/15/2021. If that is strike 2, then Daiichi and more importantly, Astrazeneca needs to think very carefully before going to battle in court and a very high percentage with strike 3. I foresee wiser heads will prevail, and a huge settlement will be met. Seagen needs to make it a very high price to pay to teach everyone else an example."
"Well, there were multiple Form 4's from sgen honchos posted yesterday, 9/2, for sales transactions that all occurred on 8/31. Including yet another one for Siegall. I could see how that might be concerning to those who are in a trade-with-the-news mode. But this is nothing new for sgen. More of the same-old, same-old of upper executives being prudent in their holdings. I don't think it's a portent of something otherwise negative."
My sell just filled after hrs. What's going on now?
"The only negative on the cc was probably the fact that they didn't narrow their guidance as to the filing of EV from ""sometime later in 2019"" to, say, ""first half of 2019."" This means that if they file in july, the drug won't be approved for at least another 12 months. That, perhaps together with the lack of detail on the trial results (no PFS, OS etc.), made some investors cautious and gave shorts an opportunity to jump in. My guess is the stock will consolidate between $70 and $75 until the filing or Tucatinib results."
"For the newbies who recently have arrived, 1. Welcome. 2. When CEO Clay Siegall says during a conference call or analyst presentation that he is ""excited"" about the prospects of a drug, you also should be excited about it. When he says he is ""very excited"" about a drug prospect and/or is ""looking forward"" to presenting the data...that is money in the bank. He said all of that numerous times during today's conference call."

SG ready to mediate pursuant to Courts 10/14/2021date, DS thinks mediation would be more beneficial if delayed until 1/2022 to conduct fact and expert discovery first.Guess whose attys bill by the hour ?Not sure discovery will help DS convince SG they didn’t steal their linker.No ruling by the judge but I wouldn’t be surprised if he extends deadline to allow some discovery.I guess DS is hoping an arbitration ruling in their favor can help in patent case.

During the first quarter and, until they sold an approximate 2% position in their SGEN holding, it had risen in value by 47% whereas most biotechs were about flat during that same time....which meant that SGEN had come to represent approximately 38% of the value of their entire fund....so taking what amounted to a less than 2% cut out of their position still left them with more than 35% of their fund in this one stock, still a huge relative position and also still substantially more than at year-end.I think they'll continue to hold their position but may sell ""a few more"" SGEN shares as long as its relative position exceeds 35% of their entire portfolio.Bottom line: no big deal, no concern....just an acknowledgement of their own success. Whether they sell the company or continue to ""go it alone"" is a wholly different question....but they do have several blockbuster drugs on the launch pad....they know what they have, they pretty well know the embedded value of the company as these drugs launch....and I'm certain they know what it'll take to get them to sell....which makes my decision to keep my shares also a good strategy knowing that the future is in very smart hands."
"Sgen is down about 1% for the 1-year period versus a gain of 26% for IBB, biotech ETF. Diane makes a good point about trading"
"Wow. More strong stock action today on fairly low volume. I'm guessing some investors liked the ASH abstracts released yesterday. I hope I'm not getting irrationally exuberant but, putting aside the many uncertainties and caveats (drug pricing concerns, elections, competition, etc.), and just for fun, here is my best case scenario if SGEN continues to execute flawlessly:$120 by Dec 11 after ASH and right before SABCS$150 by EOY if we get a Christmas rally$200 by end of 2020, assuming EV is approved in January, Tucatinib filing in February, TV results early Q2 and filing in Q3$300 by the middle of 2021 (I'm assuming a VRTX type of revenue growth acceleration (from 2015 to 2016 for them) in 2021 from $1B 2020 to $1.7B) and $2.5B and $3B estimates for 2022 and 2023.$350 buyout/merger with BP such as Roche, JNJ, etc. by the end of 2021 after a long bidding war."
Great article in endpoints…I’d give a link but can’t get it copied. Sounds like the RemeGen antibody has higher affinity and better internalization than the competition. Both are important.
Ugly price action. Back under $150?
"B of A has an update tonight LV data confirms Seagen’s strong growth potentialWe continue to like the strong risk / reward profile for SGEN (see our NPV scenarioanalysis report) after this morning’s presentation of compelling ladiratuzumab vedotindata (LV; partnered with Merck) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) presented at theongoing European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting. Indeed, the clinicalprofile of LV presented at ESMO was largely comparable to the 2L+ TNBC standard ofcare in Gilead’s Trodelvy, giving us further confidence in both the approvability andcommercial potential of the asset. Though LV currently represents a small part ($9/sh) ofour overall valuation ($210 PO), we think further de-risking of LV could be a value driverfor the stock. On that front, we look forward to initial data from the phase 2 solid tumorbasket study likely later this year. Outside of LV, we continue to like the growth profileof the commercial business with Padcev and Tukysa (each 34% 2021-2025 revenueCAGRs) positioned to move upstream and into larger patient populations (see our PadcevASCO report), including 1L urothelial, bladder, and earlier lines of breast. We could alsosee a potential 4Q21 tisotumab vedotin (TV) approval and launch (2021/2022:$22M/$68M vs. $15M/$68M cons), which could drive upside to total revenue trends in2021 (BofA: $1.51B; cons: $1.49B; guidance ~$1.46B). Meanwhile Adcetris shouldcement a stable base (13% 2021-2025 CAGR). Maintain Buy & $210 PO.TNBC clinical profile comparable to Trodelvy’sThe phase 1 ESMO data included a 28% objective response rate (ORR) achieved on the1.25mg/kg once weekly dose and an acceptable safety/tolerability profile. While thisphase 1 data is early and will need to be replicated in larger studies, we are encouragedby the clinical profile of the drug, especially as it compares to the approved Trodelvy(Gilead). Indeed, we think the commercial success of Trodelvy (see Stock Implicationsfrom the Latest 1Q21 Commercial Trends in Oncology/HemeOnc report) not just in the3L setting, but also in the off-label 2L setting should bode well for LV if and whenapproved. We note that treatment with the 1.25mg/kg dose of LV does appear to resultin a higher rate of low grade (1-2) sensory neuropathy than Trodelvy (54% vs. 24%), alower rate of high grade (3-4) neutropenia (21% vs. 52%), and a lower rate of low gradediarrhea (31% vs. 59%), however we’d caution against drawing strict lines of comparisongiven the different patient populations and smaller patient numbers in the LV study.Phase 2 in 2H21 will be first indication of program’s valueThe more important data from the ladiratuzumab vedotin (LV) program should come in thenext few months with first-time data from the ongoing phase 2 basket study in a numberof different solid tumors (lung, head & neck, esophageal, gastric, prostate, and melanoma;NCT04032704). Merck did pay pretty sizably for the program last year which does givesome external value to the program, but we don’t think investors have given it much (ifany) credit just yet given it’s still in pretty early stages—but the phase 2 data could changethat. It will depend on the magnitude of benefit seen in some of the more meaningfulindications, but positive response trends (& no major safety signals) could drive muchmore investor interest in the LV program going forward. We’d still like to see more derisking data from the phase 2 before we give it more credit both for Merck and Seagen,but there’s a lot more opportunity for upside vs. very little downside risk, in our view..Seagen (SGEN)Our NPV sum of the parts valuation gives a price objective of $210 for SGEN, whichincludes $67/share for Adcetris, $47/sh for Padcev (enfortumab vedotin), $34/sh forTukysa (tucatinib), $13/sh for tisotumab vedotin, $9/sh for ladiratuzumab vedotin, $1/shfor collaborations, $14/sh in net cash, and $25/sh for the technology platform. Weassume a WACC of 10% and terminal growth rates for each asset ranging from 0% to2%."
It's becoming clearer each day that Merck's very recent purchase of some SGEN shares at $200 will prove to have been a bargain buy. $200 likely to be in the rear view mirror by the end of October....of this year.
"Consequences of the present pandemic on overall general health are likely being vastly underestimated. My concern is that the overall morbidity and mortality from non-covid diseases will vastly exceed the eventual toll of covid itself.Inactivity, overeating, stress, depression, alcohol / addiction, decrease of routine health screenings and prevention, delay in reporting to medical practitioners and hospitals for symptom evaluation, etc. are the cause. Additionally, the rapid uptake and embracing of telemedicine as somehow an adequate substitute for addressing issues that truly may need a thorough physical review and evaluation seems, in my opinion, to be precarious.As pertains to this board, offered below is the following:https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20201001/sharp-declines-in-new-cancer-diagnoses-observed-during-covid19-pandemic?ecp%20=%20a79233f6-b413-461e-b4d8-1a3dd33869a3&M_BT=24919276849The above is offered for comment and discussion.""So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.""FDR"
"Oxymoron-SGEN reports Q2 loss but tops revenue estimates because they were expected to LOSE .61 a share but only lost .47. ""An earnings surprise"" is laughable. What would this stock look like without all those options, insider selling, bonus grants? Don't get me wrong but some things just don't add up. Hope this flies back to 200 some day because the buy out rumors for 15 years are getting old. Here comes the thumbs down and nasty comments. Chill-I'm just stating the obvious."
"Notes of SGEN JPM confab talk:I encourage anyone with the time to do so, to listen to the replay at the SGEN website.Clay did a great job presenting the material and the team did well in the Q&A.Standouts:1) EV201 (Bladder cancer) topline readouts in Q1 2019, BLA application in 20192) Tucatinib (HR2) topline readout in 20193) TV trial enrollment to be completed in second half of 20194) Two ongoing trials for Adcetris in frontline S1 and S2, one of Adcetris + AVD the other of Adcetris + AD (at least one being done by MSK) have produced results of 100% CRs (vs 85% typ with SOC)5) Roche about to submit application to EC6) GSK making good progress with BCMA trial (Clay said P2 I think) 7) ABBV achieving very promising results in P2 glioblastoma (not sure why ABBV is being shy about it)8) UNUM trials of MAB controlled CART trial are progressing well.To me hearing about the ABBV trial from Clay was a pleasant surprise for several good reasons. One of the lesser ones being that I already have a chunk of ABBV in my portfolio for their current very enticing dividend which they have been growing double digits and that will now grow larger because any GB drug will more than replace the revenue falloff of Humira.Kool"
This stock is hopelessly stuck at these levels as long as the insiders continue milking the cow...
"Regarding the Daiichi arbitration case, a decision is expected ""later this year,"" it will be promptly shared publicly, and SGEN feels good about its position. From Chip Romp, exec veep-commercial, during yesterday's conference call:""Thanks very much for the question on our litigation. I like to say, first of all, that over our history of 24 years, we are not a litigious company. We have only taken action that's appropriate to defend our IPO contractual rights. So, this is not something I hope you'll see from us on a routine basis. Now the arbitration hearing was conducted in June. And we expect a decision sometime later this year from the arbitrator. And things are proceeding according to the schedule that was set by the arbitrator.""So right now, we think everything is proceeding in an expected standard way. And nothing is unusual from what we've seen and we're going forward there. We will provide updates as soon as we have them and when we're permitted to, in the process. So, we're not going to hold something just for ourselves as soon as we could do stuff.""But I want you to know that we feel very confident in our position and we feel like it's a very important to defend our legal rights and protect the innovation that we work on so hard and deliver for patients. And so that's really where it is.""You asked a question on what's the next step? Well, it depends on what comes down with the arbitration. So, it's hard really to predict the next step. But we feel very good about our case.""You asked to also, I'm sorry, about the other litigation. There was also a patent infringement lawsuit that that's not going to court sometime next year. So that's a little different, that's not in front of an arbitrator, that's actually a court. And so that's ongoing as well. And we feel good about that one as well."""
"Oppenheimer Adjusts Seagen PT to $210 From $208 Following Strong Q2 Results, Maintains Outperform RatingBY MT Newswires— 12:34 PM ET 07/30/2021"
"Notes and details from this morning's conference call regarding EV results.Headlines: Universal kudos from analysts and no serious issues. BLA will be for accelerated approval. Already working on frontline strategy. A separate sales force already being assembled. DOR already sufficient and may be getting better. More data coming later this year.- Virtually all analysts expressed congratulations on the results, including the analyst from Bank of America, who historically have been SGEN skeptics and/or naysayers.- CEO Clay Siegall: The 44 percent OR result is “remarkable given the multiple prior therapies these patients already receive.” Comparable therapies, such as they are, have a 10 percent OR.- Siegall: “We believe these data are clinically meaningful and could establish a new standard of care. This has the potential to become our next marketed drug and expand our portfolio into solid tumors. We are incredibly excited about being able to turn the page and turn into a multi-product biotechnology company.”- The application to the FDA will be for accelerated approval, though it cannot be as accelerated as the recent 11-day approval for an expanded Adcetris label.- Siegall on the odds of FDA approval: “We together with Astellas have been working very hard on that, working with regulators on that, we have a joint committee…and I’m feeling very comfortable about where we are. We are on top of this. We have been supplying a drug conjugate for seven years to 72 countries without interruption, and we in combination with Astellas have this fully under control.”- The company feels so good about this that already is creating a separate sales team for EV and will create another sales team, if things go well, for tucatinib and breast cancer.- Siegall: “For sure, we are going to be building a separate commercial sales force [for EV]. We will not use the same sales force as Adcetris. We will press the pedal as hard as we can. As for solid tumors, we already have a leadership team in place. We have very strong commercial plans and you can be sure it will be a separate sales force.”- The duration of response, as revealed earlier, was about seven or eight months. Hints emerged that the new data will show longer DOR. Siegall: “This is a very fatal disease. Doctors try to do something for patients. This is a fantastic option for patients, to get a 44 percent response rate [regardless of DOR].”- But SGEN executives repeatedly said they had to withhold that and other data until later in the year.- Siegall: “We must preserve the opportunity to present and publish these date in peer-reviewed settings. We look forward to sharing the full description of the data later this year. We would like right now to outline all the data, for sure, but it is appropriate and correct for us to provide some topline date, enough for analysts and investors to make some informed decisions, and preserve some data for later presentation. We are very comfortable with the duration of response data. That’s all I can say now.”- SGEN and Astellas are moving quickly regarding potential frontline applications. Siegall: “We’re really excited about that…. Initial trials will inform us about going into frontline.” He said that some frontline data will be shared later this year during conferences.- They’re already looking at potential choices of other components of an EV frontline combination. Siegall: “It’s the same general approach that we had with Adcetris. First, try to get approval in a relapse setting or where patients have progressed. Then, we go to the frontline. That’s something that we’ll work on as fast as we can.”- The main side effect, neuropathy, can be controlled. Roger Dansey, SGEN chief medical officer: “Neuropathy is quite manageable. We see that it’s a manageable effect, with interruptions of therapy and other approaches.”-That’s what I have. As always, I probably missed something important, so you are advised to listen for yourselves."
"For two decades, this message board - unlike most on Yahoo - has remained above the political fray, a no-tread zone for trolls who swiftly have been muted by the vast number of responsible, knowledgeable investors who have gravitated here to discuss only one thing: SGEN. Let's keep it that way."
"In the news today, a Merck challenge to Adcetris, featuring one account with a provocative headline: ""Pembrolizumab Beats Brentuximab Vedotin in R/R Hodgkin Lymphoma."" Pembro's efficacy does appear impressive, but its safety profile does not:""Serious TRAEs were slightly higher with pembrolizumab (16.2% versus 10.5%) and led to patient discontinuations in 8.8% of patients versus 3.9% with BV; there was one treatment-related death in the pembrolizumab arm. The most common immune-mediated adverse events in the pembrolizumab and BV arms were hypothyroidism (18.9% versus 2.6%, respectively) and pneumonitis (10.8% versus 2.5%, respectively). Half of the pneumonitis cases were grade 3 or 4."""
The short beat goes on.--Of the first 100 trades today approximately 90pct were 100 share lots with highest being 747 shares. As you can see the the total volume is very light and until it picks up we will continue to drift lower. My gut feeling is we are close to the low and we will pick up on increasd volume shortly; VOLUME PRECEDES PRICE!!!
"Been following the board a LONG time and just used the mute button for the first time. Some regret, but outweighed by relief lol."
"some street analysts were disappointed in sgen 2021 guide. Others thought it was a lowball. THis is B of A latest commentsSeagen 2021 guidance: While COVID-19 is certainly impacting Adcetris uptake,we suspect the lower than expected Padcev and Tukysa guidance was more afunction of timing of label expansion opportunities, which are more likely late2021 / 2022 events as opposed to near-term weakness. Indeed, Padcev'saccelerated path to frontline urothelial (EV-301 cohort K, enrollment expected byyear end), can increase the population to ~20k, from 2-4k today. Concerns wereraised on the call around derm AEs in some Padcev patients, though our view isthat adoption is unlikely to be affected - adverse event language is common incancer drugs and particularly given the rare nature of this rash and the lack oftreatment options we don't foresee a significant commercial impact. We expectthe continued expansions into larger patient populations and the wealth of newproducts emerging from the pipeline to drive value for Seagen and longer-termoutperformance"
"For anyone interested here is the other non SGEN catalyst Evercore sees in 21And on upcoming Phase 2 and Phase 3 data releases, one significant binary standout is AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) Phase 3 duplicate trial data on Vraylar for adjunctive major depressive disorders, with primary completion coming as early as the coming week. The company has been touting that event as a value driver, but Evercore notes some intermediate risk in the event ""given that placebo-controlled MDD trials are unpredictable and it's not clear if ABBV has the right dose.""But AbbVie has said a positive result in just one of the two Phase 3 studies will be enough to push for global regulatory filings. Evercore figures $2 billion incremental peak sales means $8 billion in market cap; a 50/50 probability of success means a market cap swing in either direction of $4 billion, translating to a 3-5% move in the stock.Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX), one of Evercore's top large-cap picks, is set for Phase 3 data on Valbenazine for Huntington's disease by year-end, and investors are looking for good efficacy and a clean safety profile - in which case the stock could see 10%-plus upside. (Safety issues around depression/suicidality could sink the stock 10%.)Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX) could see a 20% stock move up or down depending on outcomes from its Phase 3 data from COVID-19 vaccine partners (using Dynavax's CpG 1018 adjuvant). The risk is low that either of its candidates would fall short of emergency use authorization standards, but ""the mRNA players and others have set the bar high."" Meanwhile, it's ""still a long ways before we're out of this pandemic, so lots of vaccine doses still to deploy.""For Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) - and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) - there's a significant binary catalyst ahead in Phase 3 data for Tofersen for SOD-1 ALS, which could come before the end of October. The company needs to show a meaningful clinical benefit/slowing of the disease progression, and Evercore assigns a better than 50% chance of success. It's expecting a 10% stock move up or down depending on results (""but if investors start to focus on the other ALS indications, the upside move could eventually be 20-35%""). Biogen has rights to the SOD-1 and C9Rx ALS programs as well as the ATXN2 program for non-hereditary ALS; IONS has full rights to the FUS1 genetic ALS program.COMPASS Pathways (NASDAQ:CMPS) is set for heavily watched Phase 2b data on its COMP360 for treatment-resistant depression, due in the fourth quarter. Prospects for success are good, though depression studies can be tricky. But potential stock move is harder to gauge: Downside from failure would be ""substantial"" (more than 60%); upside from success could be 50%-plus. Options are implying a +100% move.Krystal Biotech (NASDAQ:KRYS) has a significant binary catalyst in Phase 3 data for its B-VEC topical gene therapy for DEB. The study is powered for an absolute difference of 50% between control and treated wounds, Evercore notes, and there's low to moderate risk. Market expectations might ultimately determine a stock move (40-100% up with success, down 70% with failure).And with BELLUS Health (NASDAQ:BLU), Evercore says keep an eye on its Phase 2 data for BLU-5937 in atopic dermatitis, due in Q4, which could be ""one of the best 2H risk/reward setups."" Anything with a reasonably meaningful treatment effect will be exciting, the firm says, and risk is high (""No P2X3 antagonist has been evaluated in this setting and thus it is difficult to conclude with confidence that it will be effective"").But expectations are essentially none, as observers are focusing on the drug's other trial for chronic coughs (SOOTHE), and so this trial is a ""free call option"" where positive data could ""easily support 100% upside from current levels with very little to no downside.""As for regulatory updates, there are PDUFA dates coming for argenx (NASDAQ:ARGX), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:BMRN), BeyondSpring (NASDAQ:BYSI), and Mirum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MIRM).And in legal developments, Dynavax (DVAX) could get a boost if ACIP issues a recommendation for all adults to be vaccinated for Hepatitis B. And Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) is awaiting a decision on its dispute with Daiichi over a terminated collaboration; royalties for Seagen on Daiichi's ADCs would mean boosts to the stock target price of $15-30."
"Anybody here looking at jumping back in to the market any time soon in hopes of a turnaround, or watching any stocks in particular. I’m pretty much sticking to biotech and as a whole it’s held up pretty well.My personal belief is that while a vaccine may be a ways off I think they are learning enough about the virus to at least near term be able to prevent progression to ventilator dependence while letting the virus run its course. It seems to me that it’s an individuals immune response or overreaction of an immune response which results in cytokine storm and hyper inflammation which causes the major lung damage. There are quite a number of antibody treatments being investigated that suppress this cytokine surge. I did buy some more knsa the other day based on their very small sample size results. I already owned knsa for other reasons.I’m no scientist and not forecasting good news near term just hoping, but I am looking to take advantage of a sustained rebound should the daily news turn positive.Anyone watching any biotech of interest to help pass the time ?I did see BBs appear to be accumulating Zymeworks, which does interest me because of their ADC platform combining multiple abs and/or multiple toxins, although I usually like a lower entry price.I know there seems to be a prevailing doomsday thought process out there but I believe there are too many great biotechs and brilliant scientists out there that will provide hope and a solution.Hope everyone stays well most importantly, but I like researching biotech and respect the input on this board."
"Note from MS:Genmab and Seagen presented updated Tisotumab Vedotin data in recurrent/metastatic cancer at ESMO: The presented trial (innovaTV 205) data come from the cohorts wherein Tiso is being evaluated in combination with (i) Carboplatin as a 1st line treatment (Cohort D); and (ii) Pembrolizumab in patients who have already been treated with 1/2 lines of systemic therapy but relapsed (Cohort F) .Tiso+Carboplatin: On efficacy (median follow-up of 7.9 months), the combo treatment delivered an ORR of 55% (N=33), with ~12% CR and 43% PR. In addition, the median DOR was 8.3 months, while the mPFS was 9.5 months. On safety, ~79% of patients exhibited Gr3+ AEs (drug-related in 57.6%), with AESI including ocular events, bleeding, and peripheral neuropathy.Tiso+Pembrolizumab: On efficacy (median follow-up of 13 months), the combo treatment delivered an ORR of 38% (N=34), with ~6% CR and 32% PR. In addition, the median DOR was 13.8 months, while the mPFS was 5.6 months. On safety, ~74% of patients exhibited Gr3+ AEs (drug-related in 46%), with AESI including ocular events, bleeding, and peripheral neuropathy.Recall that in innovaTV 204 PhII trial Tiso demonstrated a 24% confirmed ORR with a median DOR of 8.3 months in late line disease. That said, we see the improved data vs. monotherapy as an incremental positive and supportive of the use of Tiso as a combo therapy with Carboplatin/Pembrolizumab. Importantly, we note that the potential use of Tiso as a 1st line therapy (with Carboplatin) would allow for sig expansion of the addressable cervical cancer population. Next key Tiso catalyst includes the PDUFA date (2+ line of therapy) on Oct 10th."

"more from b of a on PadcevPadcev positioned for first expansions after presentationsSeagen’s presentations of two Padcev trials this afternoon at ASCO GU furtherdemonstrated the patient benefit and applicability to a broader urothelial carcinoma (UC)patient population, in our view, and represent the latest step in the longer-range plan toexpand beyond the initial label which should more than outweigh any near-termconcerns with the 2021 product sales guidance. With EV-301, which serves as aconfirmatory study after the initial accelerated approval, showing an overall survivaladvantage over chemo (12.9 vs 9.0 months; HR: 0.70, p=0.001), we think full approval ishighly likely as are approvals internationally, which we assume will come in 2022, as thelarger opportunity nears with frontline UC data expected in 2022. Additionally, thepresentation of EV-201 cohort 2 (cisplatin ineligible) supports the likelihood of anexpansion of Padcev’s label, with 52% of patients having an objective response (95% CI:40.8, 62.4). Seagen’s expansion strategy is on track, with Padcev likely to makeincremental expansions in 2L UC while the ongoing frontline trial continues to accrueand Tukysa in a similar position with today’s EU approval in HER2+ breast cancer andthe MOUNTAINEER trial in other solid tumors expected to complete enrollment by theend of the year. As such, we remain bullish on Seagen and maintain Buy and $210 PO"
"Here come the mid-$60's very near-term....been a long wait but I suspect the BBs are getting closer to some sort of exit strategy....At this point, $100 would make me very happy....hope it's in the cards"
"The below is from fierce pharma:""Further, Seagen also touted “promising combination activity” of disitamab vedotin with a PD-1 inhibitor in bladder cancer. In a phase 1b/2 trial in China, the pairing of distamab vedotin and Junshi Biosciences and Coherus BioSciences’ PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab induced an overall response rate of 100% among 16 newly diagnosed metastatic bladder cancer patients with varying levels of HER2 expression, according to data unveiled at the ASCO 2021 meeting in June.Daiichi has previously paired Enhertu with Bristol Myers Squibb’s PD-1 drug Opdivo in HER2-expressing breast or bladder cancer, but that cocktail showed very similar efficacy to monotherapy Enhertu.""I found the fierce pharma article today quite informative and a bit of an eye opener. Wonder if any preclinical studies were performed in the lab with DV and Merck's PD-1 ?!?!"
"FWIW--Short position for SGEN as of 8-31-21 was 2.6 million shares. That translates to approximately 3.7 days to cover based on average daily sales volume of 700,000 shares. Last sale in the aftermarket was $163.90. Tomorrow should be an interesting day."
If you go to the Nasdaq trading site you will see that almost all of the trades today are 100 share lots. There were virtually no trades that exceeded that amount. My guess is that the selling is a concerted effort by short sellers--in the absence of buyers--can drive this stock down with very little risk. Ultimately the fundamentals will prevail. As always volume preceeds price and until we see that happen we could continue to drift down.

"1Q 2020 seems pretty solid. Big beat on revenues; modest miss on earnings, largely caused by mark-to-market but unrealized loss on IMMU shares. Reaffirms 2020 guidance, despite Covid."
"From MS:The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has denied institution of petitions for post-grant review that Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP jointly filed against Seagen's U.S. Patent 10,808,039. That patent covers a family of antibody drug conjugates. This patent is significant to Daiichi and AstraZeneca because Seagen is alleging that Enhertu infringes this patent. At bottom, the result of the PTAB's denial of institution will shift the focus of the dispute to the two pending district court litigations, particularly the Eastern District of Texas, which is a fast-moving and generally patent-owner-friendly venue, which could favor Seagen. Seagen could also benefit from the fact that district courts require a higher burden of proof than does the PTAB for demonstrating that patent claims are invalid. That is, it could be more difficult for Daiichi to demonstrate that Seagen's patent claims are invalid at the district court than at the PTAB....In short, we think that the PTAB's decision to deny institution increases Seagen's likelihood of success should the Eastern District of Texas lawsuit proceed to a jury trial currently scheduled for April 2022."
"Positive EV results; BLA in the works:BOTHELL, Wash. & TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 28, 2019-- Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) today announced positive topline results from the first cohort of patients in a pivotal phase 2 single-arm clinical trial known as EV-201. The cohort is evaluating enfortumab vedotin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have received previous treatment with both platinum-containing chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.

Immu was taken by GILD for 20 billion. SGEN now with 30 billion Market cap much better established than Immu so SGEN could be prime target for a big pharma like Merck. Bottom line it is worth more than its current market cap

"Tucatinib filing accepted by the FDA. There's an August PDUFA date, and an expectation now that the drug will be launching before the end of the year. As the primary option for Her2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastases, initial product uptake can be expected to be strong."
"My two cents, when you take calculated risks and help souls in underserved areas-- then pennies follow What caused me follow SGEN for decade +; is they have done and succeeeded in patients with very difficult oncological challenges-. using common sense science.It remains highly probable that they will remain on the same path with proper stewardship, resources, vision, and a tincture of luck Success should not be measured quarter by quarter but with a long term horizon.When you never forget why you're in business-- success follows."
"Tucatinib is likely to receive a rapid review from FDA, and win accelerated approval on the condition of additional phase IV study. As exciting and important as this opportunity in refractory Her2-positive breast cancer is, there are a small but significant number of other tumor types with very high Her2 expression that could respond to tucatinib:""Other malignancies including, but not limited to, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), ovarian, colon, and pancreatic cancer, overexpress HER2 protein and/or exhibit gene amplification in a variable percentage of cases."""
"from B of AFundamentals keep improving as shares become cheaperAhead of our call today with CEO Clay Siegall and CMO Roger Dansey as part of ourBiopharma CEO/CFO Conference Call Series, we wanted to take another look atSeagen’s valuation to see what assumptions are implied by the current share price.While SGEN shares have lagged YTD (-15.1% vs. NBI index -1.7%), in our view Seagenhas been hitting on all cylinders with respect to pipeline development and performingwell commercially in an environment where much of Biopharma saw weakness in 1Q.Indeed, pipeline momentum has continued since our last NPV scenario analysis, withBLAs accepted for Padcev to transition to full approval for the current label and anexpansion into platinum-ineligible urothelial cancer (PDUFA: Oct. 10) supported by datacoming at ASCO, and an accelerated approval for tisotumab vedotin (TV) in cervicalcancer (PDUFA: Aug. 17). We continue to like Seagen’s combination of expandingcommercial opportunities and a strong platform and we maintain our Buy and $210 PO.Shares appear to be trading with no pipeline valueWhile the upside in SGEN shares seems clear to us, with Tukysa and Padcev positionedto move upstream into larger patient populations while Adcetris forms a stable base andthe earlier pipeline develops, it is becoming more difficult for us to see meaningfuldownside to current levels. Our NPV analysis suggests that the market is assigning novalue to Seagen’s platform, as well as bear cases for Tukysa and Padcev discussedpreviously. To justify a valuation meaningfully below the current price, one also wouldhave to assume no value for TV and LV, which we would consider unlikely given thepositive data and likely fall TV approval. In fact, a bull scenario for Padcev/Tukysa couldresult in a valuation >$100/sh above the current market price."
"Thanks Red for the summary and others for the comments. I agree that the presentation was very upbeat. Clearly, they are still excited about Adcetris's future and very optimistic about Padcev and Tucatinib (""almost a pipeline in a drug""), which they suggested could be approved relatively soon not only in US but also abroad because they are participating in RTOR (Real time oncology review) and the Project Orbis pilot program.I was also pleased to hear that four INDs are planned for 2020 and they have several programs (slide 30) in phase 1, two in solid tumors, one in pancreatic cancer and one in MDS/AML that I don't think they've ever mentioned before."

"Research Alert: CFRA Keeps Buy Opinion On Shares Of Seagen, Inc.BY MT Newswires— 4:50 AM ET 07/30/202104:50 AM EDT, 07/30/2021 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We keep our target price at $179 based on our DCF analysis. Q2 EPS of ($0.47) vs. ($0.12) was $0.09 ahead of our estimate. We raise our 2021 EPS estimate to ($1.97) from ($2.06). Q2 product sales grew 44% Y/Y to $347 million, ahead of expectations due to outperformance from Adcetris, Padcev, and Tukysa. Despite the beat, SGEN maintained its full-year financial guidance, which seems like a conservative move to us. We look forward to a strong second half from SGEN given recent label expansions, additional country launches for Tukysa, and the potential approval of tisotumab vedotin (approval expected by October 10). In July, the FDA granted Padcev regular approval and a new indication (adults with urothelial cancer with limited treatment options). Meanwhile, SGEN continues to make solid progress on its pipeline as enrollment continues for the Phase III EV-302 trial evaluating Padcev with Keytruda and the phase II MOUNTAINEER trial is on track to complete enrollment by 2021 end."
"initial thoughts from B of A. will have more detail tomorrow morningCommercial momentum going into 2H21Second quarter results for Seagen were strong, with revenue ($388M, +$35M) exceedingexpectations, while guidance was maintained. Adcetris sales were impressive at $182M(+$12M); meanwhile Padcev ($82M, +$7M) resumed its growth trajectory and Tukysa($83M, +$8M) continued to perform well. OpEx was in line (SG&A -$2M; R&D -$2M),leading to an above-consensus loss per share $(0.47) vs. $(0.58). With solid commercialmomentum and impressive pipeline development set to deliver new approved productsover the short and medium term, we remain bullish on Seagen shares. Maintain Buy and$210 PO.

Indeed, Padcev should benefit from the recent labelexpansion, Tukysa uptake is expected to remain strong, and we could see some revenuecontribution from tisotumab vedotin in 4Q21. While the rest of 2021 appears strongcommercially, the pipeline is set to deliver a 4th approved drug in tisotumab vedotin (Oct10 PDUFA) and the EV-103 cohort K should be enrolled by year-end and potentially bringPadcev to the front line, creating new legs for growth to maintain Seagen’s momentumand progress towards sustainable profitability."
"Pieris Pharmaceuticals (PIRS) said it would receive a $13 million equity investment from the biotech firm Seagen (SGEN) Under the terms, Seagen bought 3.7 million Pieris shares at $3.51 each, the companies said in a statement.At last check Pieris shares were 2% higher at $2.55. Seagen shares were trading 2.5% lower at $136.73.In a collaboration, the companies will jointly evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pieris's cinrebafusp alfa (PRS-343) and Seagen's Tuksya (tucatinib) as a combined treatment for gastric cancer.The effort to combine cinrebafusp alfa with Tukysa in gastric cancer patients follows ""the generation of compelling preclinical data,"" Pieris President and Chief Executive Stephen S. Yoder said in a statement.""Preclinical data exploring the combination of cinrebafusp alfa and Tukysa are encouraging and support evaluating the combination"" in a planned Phase 2 clinical trial, said Marjorie Green, a physician who is senior vice president for late-stage development at Seagen. The companies have also amended their current immuno-oncology collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize the second of as many as three products, they added.Pieris, Boston, will have “an option to participate in co-promotion of that program in the U.S.” The company will also be “entitled to increased royalties from that program” if it chooses that option, the companies said.Seagen, Bothell, Wash., would be solely responsible for developing and commercializing that program."
"OK, Here's a bunch of historical stats. Don't know if they're meaningful but it's a rainy day.1) Year over Year Total Revenue growth for 2017, 2018, 2019 has been: 15%, 36%, 40%.2) Year over Year Net Product Sales for 2017, 2018, 2019 has been: 16%, 55%, 32%3) Interesting that for 2019 both ""Collaboration/License"" and ""Royalty"" Revenues had the biggest % increases at 59% and 66%Comparing the ACTUAL Total Revenue numbers to the initial GUIDANCE Total Revenue numbers for eachyear, 2017, 2018, 2019 the % variance for each of those years using the MID Point numbers from the ranges stated has been: +13.5%, +34.3%, +12.5%.When doing the same Guidance/Actual comparison for Net Product Sales alone again using the MID Point numbers for the ranges given the % differences have been: 6.1%, 36.3%, 0.5%.So it's clear that their annual guidance numbers have a history of being conservative with their ongoing business as they have exceeded projections for each year by nearly 20%. That percentage may be little high as a predictor as in 2018 they beat their initial projections by 34.3%.Their initial mid range guidance for Total Revenue for 2020 excluding PADCEV Revenues is $892.5 Mil. If they were to beat that by 20% that would put them in the area of $1.071 Mil plus whatever happens with PADCEV. Throw in $130 Mil or so for that (who knows?) and they're around $1.2B which would be about a 31% increase over 2019.Other takes would be appreciated."
"On 12/20/2019, FDA news release...FDA approves new treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have progressed on available therapiesThe FDA granted the approval of Enhertu to Daiichi Sankyo.Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) for the treatment of adults with unresectable (unable to be removed with surgery) or metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. Enhertu is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, meaning that the drug targets the changes in HER2 that help the cancer grow, divide and spread, and is linked to a topoisomerise inhibitor, which is a chemical compound that is toxic to cancer cells.Can someone respond if this is SGEN's competitor or using patent?Thanks"
"The BB's strategy in play here, as I still believe and as I posted last week, is to modestly reduce the representation of SGEN in their overall portfolio....as opposed to remaining severely overweighted in the stock. Furthermore, in looking at their Q 1 adds, they probably wanted to have some dry powder to add a few new names to their existing portfolio, taking advantage of the strong outperformance of SGEN relative to many other promising biotechs. My comment from last week appears immediately below.Let me explain Baker Brother's SGEN strategy. At the end of 2018, BB's holdings in SGEN represented 30% of their entire portfolio, clearly a very large percentage of their fund's assets. During the first quarter and, until they sold an approximate 2% position in their SGEN holding, it had risen in value by 47% whereas most biotechs were about flat during that same time....which meant that SGEN had come to represent approximately 38% of the value of their entire fund....so taking what amounted to a less than 2% cut out of their position still left them with more than 35% of their fund in this one stock, still a huge relative position and also still substantially more than at year-end.I think they'll continue to hold their position but may sell ""a few more"" SGEN shares as long as its relative position exceeds 35% of their entire portfolio.Bottom line: no big deal, no concern....just an acknowledgement of their own success. Whether they sell the company or continue to ""go it alone"" is a wholly different question....but they do have several blockbuster drugs on the launch pad....they know what they have, they pretty well know the embedded value of the company as these drugs launch....and I'm certain they know what it'll take to get them to sell....which makes my decision to keep my shares also a good strategy knowing that the future is in very smart hands."
"At least this Chinese biotechnology acknowledges the linker technology is SG's. unlike DS.Also these Her2 abs will be used in conjunction with PD 1s which kind of sets up a future battle against the 2 trastuzumab entrants from Roche and AZ/DS and so far the ab we just licensed shows better binding and granted breakthrough fda status.since PD1 combo is the way to go I think Mercck may be more interested despite what Paul the chat board analyst has to say.I like the proactive approach to jump on this new ab, which due to the linker, SG probably had access to some promising data.Now , with fingers crossed, we get royalties from Enhertu for stealing our linker, and develop the ads that may prove to be more efficacious in the long run."

"If Seagen's enfortumab gets more positive data in combination with Merck's Keytruda in their multiple ongoing clinical trials, Merck is going to get really interested in Seagen. If I was big pharma, I would be very nervous if Merck buys Seagen, and then go to war to enforce ADC IP. Merck will seek injunctions and not just for settlements/royalties if they own the ADC linker IP."
MY guess is Looks like major holder going to drop 100k shares this A.M.. My guess is Baker Bros.
"Exactly one year ago today--9-14-20--Merck announced their collaboration with and investment in Seagen. The stock closed that day at $171.79 up 14.61 pct It susequently peaked on 10-13-20 at $213.94. Here we are struggling to hold $150.. despite having $2.5 billion in cash, and 3 great drugs in the market and a 4th awaiting approval next month. It is hard to reconcile this price performance considering all the major indexes are near all time highs. Having to reiterate all of the disappointment of the last 365 days was painful but it is both my hope belief that future is bright and that we are on a journey to new all time highs within the next 365 day time frame. Continued good luck to all Longs."
"Overall, I thought the cc was positive. Guidance on Adcetris is probably a little conservative and they are clearly bullish on Padcev and Tucatinib. The stock should hit new highs if/when we get positive results from the TV trial. Below is what I think is a good summary:Slight 4Q19 Adcetris miss, but soft 2020 guidance: Mgt. reported a 6% miss on Adcetris sales of $166M vs. $177M cons. Total revenues, excluding one-time milestone payments of $72M, were roughly in-line with cons (~$218M vs. $222M cons). 4Q19 total revenues were ~$290M, with $32M in collaboration payments from GlaxoSmithKline and BeiGene, and a $40M milestone from Takeda associated with ex-US Adcetris sales. 2020 guidance included the following: $675M-$700M in Adcetris sales (vs. $778M cons), royalty revenue of $105M- $115M (vs. $129M cons), and $30M-$50M in collaboration revenue expectations (vs. $116M cons). Mgt. guided to $475M-$525M in SG&A expenses for 2020, or ~34% Y/Y growth at the midpoint, and R&D guidance of $860M-950M, or ~25% Y/Y growth at the midpoint. Mgt. did not guide to revenues associated with recently launched product Padcev. The company achieved positive net income during 4Q19 due to ~$60M in investment income associated with equity holdings. Net income is expected to be negative again in 1Q20.Key takeaways from the call: (1) Mgt. indicated that while Adcetris growth of ~10% Y/Y was well below prior years of 50% and 34%, it sees 2020 as an interim growth year for Adcetris. Five-year front line data in 2H20 could potentially impact sales growth; (2) Mgt. noted that initial uptake of Padcev has been encouraging. The Padcev salesforce was active in January, and 1.5k accounts (of 2.8k key accounts and 3.2k total in the US) have already been contacted. Mgt. expects to provide Padcev guidance at a later date; (3) On Tisotumab Vedotin, data from the potentially pivotal PhII trial will be available in 1H20. Mgt. indicated that it sees Keytruda, which had a ~14% response rate (and ~1 year PFS) in high PD-L1-expressing patients, as the bar to assess TV data. There remains a significant unmet need for innovative therapies in the late-stage cervical cancer setting; (4) On tucatinib, based on FDA feedback, the MOUNTAINEER study has been expanded to include 110 participants. This potentially registrational PhII trial is intended to evaluate tucatinib (plus trastuzumab) in metastatic HER2+ colorectal cancer (mCRC). We see the trial expansion as a positive which could accelerate the timeline associated with the label expansion; (5) Mgt. noted that additional data from a subgroup analysis of tucatinib in HER2+ BC patients with CNS involvement may be presented later this year. As a reminder, tucatinib demonstrated significant activity in BC patients with brain metastases.We expect some pressure on SGEN as investors absorb 2020 guidance: While 2020 is likely to be another transformational year for the company, the impact of guidance, which has lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs, is likely to cause some pressure on SGEN. Importantly, mgt. was upbeat about the launch of Padcev, which was not included in guidance (but is in consensus numbers) and we believe mgt. Adcetris estimates could prove conservative. That said, we expect clinical catalysts and the Padcev launch to be the key drivers of SGEN in 2020. Key upcoming catalysts include the innovaTV 204 readout of TV in 1H20 and the FDA/EMA acceptance of the tucatinib filing."
"Redhot hit it on the nose about the greed. Vaughn Himes bought 6000 seagen shares at $26.10 on Sept. 8th and paid $156,600. Sold these same shares in the same day in the open market for $150.00 for a total of $900,000. He still owns 178k shres for a total of around 27 million.

"FDA announces plans to remove barriers to unapproved cancer therapiesThe Washington Post (6/3, McGinley) reports the Food and Drug Administration intends to provide “concierge service” to physicians seeking access for unapproved drugs to treat cancer patients with no other treatment options. The agency’s Oncology Center for Excellence’s director Richard Pazdur said the goal was to remove “perceived hurdles” for doctors who wish to use the FDA’s “expanded access” program. The project “was announced at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.”The AP (6/3, Marchione) reports that the initiative is motivated by the thousands of cancer patients who seek “compassionate use” access to these treatments, which “are not yet on the market but have shown some promise in early testing and aren’t available to them through a study.”"
"This is what I wrote 11 months ago. If a buyout happens, I still think it is likely to be in 2021 with MRK now being the most likely buyer. If you think a buyout at below $400 ($70B market cap) would be too low today, I just feel it is not realistic. Consider that 2020 and 2021 average revenue estimates for SGEN are $1.47B and $1.77B, for REGN (MC $64B) they are $8.15B and $9.5B), for VRTX (Market cap $69B) $5.99B [sales growth 49.50%] and $6.8B.I've seen peak sales estimates for IMMU's Trodelvy as high as $4B. Clearly, GILD thinks it'll do even better. Maurizio11 months ago$SGEN conversationWow. More strong stock action today on fairly low volume. I'm guessing some investors liked the ASH abstracts released yesterday. I hope I'm not getting irrationally exuberant but, putting aside the many uncertainties and caveats (drug pricing concerns, elections, competition, etc.), and just for fun, here is my best case scenario if SGEN continues to execute flawlessly:$120 by Dec 11 after ASH and right before SABCS$150 by EOY if we get a Christmas rally$200 by end of 2020, assuming EV is approved in January, Tucatinib filing in February, TV results early Q2 and filing in Q3$300 by the middle of 2021 (I'm assuming a VRTX type of revenue growth acceleration (from 2015 to 2016 for them) in 2021 from $1B 2020 to $1.7B) and $2.5B and $3B estimates for 2022 and 2023.$350 buyout/merger with BP such as Roche, JNJ, etc. by the end of 2021 after a long bidding war."
Nice hike today. This is the only bio stock I have faith in today. ADAP-NLTX-KOD-ACAD-BLUE-etc. are total train wrecks this year.
"Theories: 1. The S&P 500 rebalance theory is bogus. That doesn't happen until the third week of March. The heavy hitters knew it was bogus, so they weren't piling in on that theory, and small timers don't have the kind of cash it would take to buy on rumors a $165 stock in the amounts that traded Friday afternoon. 2. The earnings theory doesn't pass historical muster. For one thing, SGEN is more prone to slight earnings disappointments than it is to beats of any nature, much less a beat so dramatic that it would add $4.5 billion in market cap during two hours of trading on triple the average volume. Also, despite what some may think, SGEN doesn't leak. Not about earnings, not about anything. Not ever. 4. There was no market-moving news or really any news. 3. So it has to be something else, something that was known or believed outside the company. A positive ruling in the DS dispute or, maybe for real this time, M&A action. Or something like that. Something that others on Wall Street - entities with VERY deep pockets - learned about or thought they learned about around 2 p.m. EST yesterday. Monday morning could be interesting. All of the above is imo."
Nice finish on increased volume in lousy market. Must be making favorable impression on first day at ESMO. Next couple of weeks should be very interesting as we get closer to PDUFA date for our 4th drug approval.

"I'll start by saying I've always appreciated the thoughts of many here on this board. It has not been a pump & dump type discussion board, like so many are, and I've benefited greatly over the last 15 or so years from you all taking the time to share your wisdom and insights. So - Thank You! That said, NO ONE here has the first idea why the Baker Bros may have sold what so far is a tiny fraction of their holdings in SGEN. It was just over TWO PERCENT of their holdings. 1 Million Shares Sold, but they still hold ~ 44 Million. I read MANY here who have have often advocated diversifying some of their OWN holdings at many levels FAR lower than this (80, 100, 120 ETC). You always explained that you were following your own stock discipline & could sleep better, retire easier or just plain made a profit and therefore trimmed your positions. And it was ALWAYS more than TWO PERCENT of what you had. Now if they keep selling a SIZABLE % (For me that would be 20% of Holdings) than I'd be concerned. But with the stock having just gone up $30 after earnings (in 3 trading days), in the middle of a pandemic and with election uncertainty on the horizon - I personally feel 2% is NOTHING. I am grateful to have stumbled upon this stock so long ago, largely because of the Bakers, and as long as the science continues to help the company and mankind prosper, I will continue holding on to it. Just my 2 cents - Continued good fortune to all longs! John"
"Brief summary of SGEN’s presentation - Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2019Bottom line: Very impressive. Upbeat. No worrisome issues identified by me.No huge news, imo, aside perhaps for this: CEO Clay Siegall signaled that SGEN is not currently shopping for other companies and is unlikely to do so in the near term. See the notes below. ((The analyst did not ask him about the likelihood of SGEN being the target of other shoppers because these analysts never ask a question as obvious and consequential as that.)A few initial points: SGEN is getting better placement, better visibility at these sessions. It used to present very early or very late in the day. This time, at the Credit Suisse 28th Annual Healthcare Conference, it presented in prime time at 10:20 a.m. local time in Scottsdale, Arizona.Siegall was focused, articulate, on point and extremely enthusiastic.SGEN’s share price, already on an upswing today, rose steadily during his presentation.A few of Siegall’s comments, none overly surprising to me but reassuring nonetheless:- “Our vision was always to do the best job we can for cancer patients with unmet medical needs and to have a deep pipeline with many progressing products.”- Adcetris will pass $1 billion in global sales in 73 countries this year. Siegall: “The growth of Adcetris will be steady. I don’t think it will be straight up like a market launch, but there will be growth. We see it growing from $1.1 billion globally to $1.5 billion and maybe $2 billion.”- Enfortumab vedotin (PDUFA date of March 15, 2020). Siegall: “We’re working very closely with the FDA and always our hope is to get approval ahead of PDUFA, as we have in the past.” Frontline coming next and is extremely promising because EV can be administered to virtually any patient with bladder cancer. “The data were called ‘phenomenal.’ We can come in and say every patient can have this new chemo-free regimen. We can simplify it, and that’s what we’re trying to do next.”- Tucatinab for breast cancer and likely colorectal, gastric and other solid cancers. He was exuberant about data that will be released for the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in mid-December. Siegall: “We hit all our end points. We hit PFS in patients with measurable brain metastases. This is the power of tucatinab. We are working with the FDA to get this out as soon as we can. We want to save lives.”- SGEN’s healthy cash hoard and the possibility of other acquiring other companies. “We have a very busy R&D lineup…. We’re developing over 11 drugs. Our money is set for that. We do look and see about other acquisitions, but I wouldn’t say there’s something pending tomorrow.”- More on this: “There are a lot of very clever, very small companies that could work with us. I think if we did that, we would go to Wall Street the next day [as they did once in the past] and say, ‘This is what we want to buy.’ But, at some point, our revenues could go up to the point where we don’t have to go to Wall Street, and we’re at the point where our revenues should be growing substantially. Right now, we have no debt and we’re in a really good position.”That’s all I have. I probably missed something important. As always, I recommend that you listen to the archived version of the event."
"BofA/Merrill Lynch analyst Geoff Meacham reinstates coverage on Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ: SGEN) with a Neutral rating and a price target of $125.00.The analyst comments ""...we think the YTD run up in share price (+107%; NBI index: +22%) reflects these nearer-term opportunities without a lot of visibility on the earlier stage pipeline. Hence, while we like fundamentals, we think valuation upside could be challenging and we would look to other SMid biotech names in our coverage universe such as BioMarin or Moderna that we believe have better risk/reward profiles.""This analyst's comments seem reasonable enough today. Analysts' comments after ASH and especially after Tucatinib data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on Dec 11 will obviously be much more important."
"Just had a chance to listen to CC. Unlike some of today's postings, and of course the sp drop today - down $9 or so as I post this(BTDT) - I liked the call. All of the pipeline developments are on track, the overall revenue shows strong growth and they say they are making headway with regard to entrenched practices, and its very early on in terms of PTCL impact. The only element that has roiled the market and some posters here is that their 2019 projections evidently seem to those folks to be on the weak growth side. Well, we've Been Here Done That before as well. In fact all of that was true a year ago. Then the year played out and SGEN beat their initial Adcetris projections for 2018 by 32%-40%, their Royalty projections by 4%-11%, their Collaboration projections by 45%-52%, for a total revenue projection beat of 30%-39%. Doesn't guarantee the same results for this year's projections, but we all know they almost always put out conservative numbers (with one Q exception).Paladin"
"I would prefer to see the BB keep buying (though they did buy a ton of shares all the way up to $59 per share) but the stock is acting strong anyway. It appears that renewed optimism about Adcetris, potential buyout, and a string of near term catalysts are keeping sellers away: acceptance of EV filing, GSK filing of Belantamab mafodotin, and the biggie -- Tucatinib pivotal trial results."
"The aftermarket doesn't seem to like that Adcetris sales were flat from 2Q to 3Q and ever so slightly missed guidance. But Padcev revenues were ahead of expectation, the first full quarter of Tukysa sales were excellent, and the company has about $2.7 billion in its war chest.If shares dip by a lot tomorrow morning, I think it's a good opportunity to pick up a few more and add to existing long positions."
"If anybody has access to records or information regarding the Texas district court lawsuit with Daiichi, please post. The claim construction hearing is supposed to begin today.""In the meantime, the Texas court has set a schedule for the case, including a jury trial to start in April 2022. The next key milestone is the claim construction hearing. Claim constructions are important because they can improve or weaken non-infringement and invalidity arguments. The claim construction hearing is set for 8/27/2021."""
"Formidable stock action bodes well for Sgen’s future in spite of the fact that our market cap is now $18B just like INCY, whose Q3 revenues were $534M v Sgen’s $213M. My guess is that the market is bullish on Seattle Genetics because they have good reasons to believe the following:1. Adcetris sales will continue to grow rather slowly but surely.2. EV will be approved early 2020, Tucatinib late 2020, TV early 2021, which will provide an excellent chance to have explosive revenue growth in 2021.3. LIV-1 also has a good chance to be a strong drug and may be approved in 2021. Siegal also emphasized on the last cc that they have several other potential drugs in early development, which will hopefully help provide continued growth.4. Management has shown they have a strong ability to spot under the radar assets (Immu, Cascadian)."
"general comments on the quarterReiterate Rating: BUY | PO: 210.00 USD | Price: 172.02 USDBuy thesis intact even with guidance volatilitySeagen’s 4Q call was highlighted by the below-consensus 2021 sales guidance,obscuring the underlying pipeline expansion, which continues apace and in our view ispicking up steam. While COVID-19 is certainly impacting Adcetris uptake, we suspect thelower than expected Padcev and Tukysa guidance was more a function of timing of labelexpansion opportunities, which are more likely late 2021 / 2022 events as opposed tonear-term weakness. Indeed, Padcev’s accelerated path to frontline urothelial (EV-301cohort K, enrollment expected by year end), can increase the population to ~20k, from 2-4k today. Concerns were raised on the call around derm AEs in some Padcev patients,though our view on the risk/benefit profile of the drug is unchanged, with the worst caselikely being additional language added to the label. Adoption is unlikely to be affected,we think, as adverse event language is common in cancer drugs and particularly giventhe rare nature of this rash and the lack of treatment options we don’t foresee asignificant commercial impact. In all, Seagen fundamentals are very much intact, and weexpect the continued expansions into larger patient populations and the wealth of newproducts emerging from the pipeline to drive value and longer-term outperformance, asdescribed in our recent upgrade. Reiterate Buy; new PO $210, still derived from ourSOTP NPV analysis.Pipeline UpdatesA BLA was filed for tisotumab vedotin (TV) in cervical cancer, with accelerated approvalrequested. The full data for the EV-301 trial in 2nd line urothelial carcinoma will bepresented tomorrow at ASCO GU, followed by international filings later this quarter. TheEV-201 Cohort 2 (cis-ineligible, post PD(L)-1) data will be submitted this quarter for USand international approval. Enrollment in the Tukysa MOUNTAINEER trial in colorectalcancer is expected to be completed by year end.Model ChangesWe have updated our model to reflect 4Q20 trends going into 2021. We now forecast2021 and 2022 revenue of $1.56B and $2.15B, respectively, from $1.83B and $2.49Bprior. Our new 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates are -$1.70 and $0.05, respectively, from$0.15 and $2.00 prior."
"This news from BCYC came out on Thursday and was the primary reason for SGEN's share weakness later in the week:BT8009, a Nectin-4 targeting BTC with a potentially differentiated profile as compared to a Nectin-4 targeting ADC has shown preliminary anti-tumor activity in the ongoing Phase I portion of its Phase I/II trial.It means that Padcev will likely face serious competition late in this decade. Obviously this isn't great news for SGEN, but the pullback from over 175 on Monday seems way overdone."
"Wonder, if at $30 bill market cap, anyone could buy Sgen?"
"Goldman Sachs: SGEN now a “conviction buy” with price target of $246. $SGEN upgraded to Conviction Buy at Goldman Sachs, $246 PT from $178 - Co. poised for both near- and long-term growth on the back of three approved drugs with multiple label expansion opportunities and a ""robust"" pipeline.“(First time I ever heard the phrase “conviction buy,” especially connected to a stock I own.”"
"Let’s play “Instant Buyout Price.” To be clear, this is not a pro-con, I do/do not favor a buyout at this time thread. Set that aside. Rather, if the Bakers accepted an offer tonight, what do you think the price would be? I’ll start with $136 per share, a 70 percent premium based on Adcetris growth but also mostly on the pipeline. Your price and rationale?"
FWIW--Yesterday marked the all time high for SGEN stock and here we are a year later 45 points lower despite an abundance of good news. Hopefully the good news continues and we will surpass that milestone high in the near future as the fundamentals are getting better every day. GLTL.
