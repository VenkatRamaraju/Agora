"Good Results. The street will like it. Meeting the estimates."" “We experienced encouraging trends during the June quarter, as we saw sequential revenue growth across industry verticals and technologies,” said Rami Rahim, chief executive officer, Juniper Networks. “We are making progress with our sales transformation efforts which, along with our strong pipeline of opportunities, is providing confidence in our ability to not only deliver sequential revenue growth through the remainder of the year, but also a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter.” """
JNPR is down 6.55% to 22.87
"Juniper either has to sale or buy Extreme Networks for $15/share..buying Extreme would add to portfolio with wireless and single pane networking and add 30k worth of customers if not they should try and sell company since they are competing against Cisco, Arista, HPE and Huawai"
"JNPR made to Zacks top 5 Strong Sell List, there we go down from here"

Or maybe someone else is buying and cnbc got the wrong name. After all JNPR has not denied yet.So buyout is in play hopefully. Someone MAKING tools for AWS CLOUD has to be values a lot more.
Going Up Up Up!!!
one of Dan Niles top picks. 
"NOKIA & JUNIPER NETWORKS: A Tales of 2 Losers in 2018Juniper Networks went on a wild ride, seeing their shares spike as much as 34% in after-hours trading on rumors Nokia was thinking about buying incompetent Juniper Networks.Juniper and Nokia speculation is a classic Pump and Dump: another worthless merger at huge premium in 2018 with impotent management, currently struggling to grow its revenues, massive erosion in profits and gross margin has fallen. Nokia shareholders still paying a painful price for Nokia and ALU (Alcatel Lucent) for $16.6 billion in 2014. Should a heavily indebted Nokia with a junk debt rating and too many shares out be buying useless Juniper Networks at huge premium price? Nokia should wait to pick up Juniper at bottom pricing very soon. Global Service Providers have reduced spending over the next 18 months, which has severely impacted revenue growth and profit margins. Meanwhile, we’re seeing growing competition from China’s (FXI) Huawei, Cisco, Ericsson, Arista Networks, which is gaining market share rapidly, and this penetration has negatively impacted Nokia and Juniper Networks. Juniper Networks laid off an unknown number of workers — but perhaps as many as 800 employees in 2017. Both Nokia and Juniper Network will be renegotiating and exiting several contracts and could eliminate ~10,000 jobs to reduce costs. High restructuring charges negatively impacted profit margins and diluted the companies’s gross and operating income.Tech and Semi sectors will swing hard during the next 30 days and projection for 2018 will be a challenge. It will be either profit taking after an excessive performance, fundamental breakdown or both. The risk is higher when big investors rotates out to protect their profits and re-balance their portfolios."
Higher highs and higher lows forming nicely. JNPR will pop up 
Classic Pump and Dump with speculation about Juniper. JNPR is zombie stock with decline revenue and no innovation

"In a weird situation like this, you tend to think ""shareholder lawsuit"", except it wasn't the company's action that led to the stock glitch, it was a news organization. However, what if the reporting was correct, that they are indeed in negotiation with Nokia. Would the company be allowed to deny it if it is indeed going on?"
go
Jnpr and extr are trading the same pattern !! Maybe something in the works for them
"Dead money for the past 2 decades. The entire stock market has risen to epic proportions, yet JNPR might be the worst performing mid cap stock of all time. Sorry to see so many were left holding the bag here."
Have shares for the longest since internet bubble! lol i guess i’ll die with it ...
"JNPR can't compete with Cisco, HPE, Arista since they under invested for years. Juniper needs to acquire EXTR and expand to the whole spectrum of networking. EXTR is that last networking companies left that is end to end networking including wireless, AI and Cloud..no brainer here"
It will go to $29's and then $30's...Just watch Level 2 and the hourly charts....

"Nice Opportunity to own this company. Interesting how the analysts all downgraded in the past 3 days and then we have a preannouncement. Hmmm very interesting and basically NOT LEGAL but of course no one will investigate. Anyway, all the institutional guys reacted already and this will become a nice buying opportunity. 2018 sets up well for JNPR and at 25 this is very cheap from a fundamental perspective. Good luck."

"JNPR's incompetent management blows another Q's beat with poor earnings guidance. One would think with a reduction of over 10% of shares they would be able to beat consistently moving forward. Need an activist to push for a total sell of the company in the 30s. Maybe ERIC, HPE or even a PE buy! Now's the time to buy it cheap while the management is floundering around."

"Got some JNPR yesterday. One thing I wonder- in their conf call they mention using silicon photonics. Wonder whether Cisco's purchase of Acacia has any impact on that. Why did I get some JNPR? It's cheap and they have a decent balance sheet. Business wise I have no idea how they are going to perform, but at their stock price I figure the risk/reward ought to be decent."
"I got so excited about buyout, I bought 12 YEARS ago at $22 and have been waiting for something to happen to make it go up, now this. Hope Nokia is just bluffing and intends to buy it for real."
"Excellent report, beat both revenue and EPS: 1.1798B vs 1.17B and 0.54 vs 0.44 estimates...It should go up to $30's...Thanks."
"Hands down one of the worst performing Naz stocks of the past decade. The entire stock market has exploded to insane heights, many stocks surging 20 fold yet JNPR has remained in a $4 range for years. Sad!"
I lost lot of money because irresponsible news and journalism from cnbc
"If Nokia were planning on buying JNPR and it leaked, they would have to deny to keep the price down. Nokia would not admit it even if they are interested acquiring JNPR. Nokia does not have to report on rumors. They can basically say what they want with regards to rumors of acquisition. Nokia may still be in negotiations and does not want to play their hand to the rest of the market."

Rami rahim for the last 4 quarters blaming the. loud customers with a standard statementWhile our Q4 outlook is being impacted by the pace of deployments at several cloud customers
"Nokia says not preparing offer for Juniper NetworksReuters ReutersNovember 29, 2017Comment(Reuters) - Finnish network equipment maker Nokia (NOKIA.HE) said on Wednesday that it was not in talks to buy U.S. network gear maker Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) despite earlier reports to the contrary.""Nokia is not currently in talks with, nor is it preparing an offer for, Juniper Networks related to an acquisition of that company,"" the company said in a statement.CNBC had earlier reported, citing sources, that Nokia was in talks to buy Juniper at an offer that would value the company at around $16 billion (£11.93 billion).Juniper had a market capitalisation of around $11.26 billion as of Wednesday's close, according to CNBC."
"Found this at Barron's=Juniper’s trading patterns have suggested investors suspected a transaction was possible. In today’s weak tape, Juniper shares rose 5%, and we fielded numerous calls from investors seeking a reason. We would have guessed that a private equity (PE) buyer would have been more likely than a strategic buyer. We believe Juniper has strong FCF at over $1 billion in 2018, and we could imagine a PE buyer valuing Juniper at 12-13x FCF, 15x Net Income or $12-13 billion, which corresponds to $35-37 a share."

This stock has been floating predictably between $24-30 for years now. Real easy to buy low and sell high on this stock as I have proven to myself. The predictability of this stock allows for $ to be made. and even a bit of a dividend. I hope it never goes above $32.
Apstra acquisition is a good move. Should see the stock at $25 in a few days.
wow! this stock did a whole lot of nothing for 20 years!

JNPR reached a 52 Week low at 20.99
"Ferocious sellingWhy the high volume dumping the last 2 days? Juniper received several upgrades after earnings, including “buys” with targets as high as $28 I believe. I guess that was why the day after earnings the stock price went up to over $25 before starting its big downtrend. Seems odd and again this stock never seems to go anywhere but down lately. Even with the impact of coronavirus on earnings, most stocks, unlike JNPR, are going up nicely. What a dog!"
"This was very nasty.I am aware the untill a deal is confirmed all is rumour so whomever burned themselves chasing the rumor has only themselves to blame, no discussion. That said, wouldn't it be 'decent' for CBNC to at least apologize and explain want went wrong in their reporting, now they act like nothing has happened.Ps for all those indicating what a losing company JNPR is; it has margins and income that 90% of all companies on this planet can only dream off while it trades at a discount compared to them. Soner or later we will see the 45$ again."

I find it amazing that these announcements just come out of the blue. There was a huge dump at the open today and the stock stayed crushed for the rest of the session. Are you going to tell me that somebody didn't get a heads up on this announcement and dump it before the herd headed for the exits? There isn't a fair market for those of us who aren't insiders and this shows that the game rolls on for those in the know.
Looking good today.

"I was planning to get back in if JNPR got back to around 25. But it sounds like they had a dismal quarter. I need to take a closer look and see if they are just mired in a temporary recession in their neck of the woods, or if they are just a company that is not competitive in today's economy."
