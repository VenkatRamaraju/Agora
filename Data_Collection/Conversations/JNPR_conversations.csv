Who in their right mind would buy stock/invest into this mess of a company? -20 return investment 
"NOKIA & JUNIPER NETWORKS: A Tales of 2 Losers in 2018Juniper Networks went on a wild ride, seeing their shares spike as much as 34% in after-hours trading on rumors Nokia was thinking about buying incompetent Juniper Networks.Juniper and Nokia speculation is a classic Pump and Dump: another worthless merger at huge premium in 2018 with impotent management, currently struggling to grow its revenues, massive erosion in profits and gross margin has fallen. Nokia shareholders still paying a painful price for Nokia and ALU (Alcatel Lucent) for $16.6 billion in 2014. Should a heavily indebted Nokia with a junk debt rating and too many shares out be buying useless Juniper Networks at huge premium price? Nokia should wait to pick up Juniper at bottom pricing very soon. Global Service Providers have reduced spending over the next 18 months, which has severely impacted revenue growth and profit margins. Meanwhile, we’re seeing growing competition from China’s (FXI) Huawei, Cisco, Ericsson, Arista Networks, which is gaining market share rapidly, and this penetration has negatively impacted Nokia and Juniper Networks. Juniper Networks laid off an unknown number of workers — but perhaps as many as 800 employees in 2017. Both Nokia and Juniper Network will be renegotiating and exiting several contracts and could eliminate ~10,000 jobs to reduce costs. High restructuring charges negatively impacted profit margins and diluted the companies’s gross and operating income.Tech and Semi sectors will swing hard during the next 30 days and projection for 2018 will be a challenge. It will be either profit taking after an excessive performance, fundamental breakdown or both. The risk is higher when big investors rotates out to protect their profits and re-balance their portfolios."
Rumors of activists getting involved with JNPR is driving price up this week.
"Juniper either has to sale or buy Extreme Networks for $15/share..buying Extreme would add to portfolio with wireless and single pane networking and add 30k worth of customers if not they should try and sell company since they are competing against Cisco, Arista, HPE and Huawai"
"If Nokia were planning on buying JNPR and it leaked, they would have to deny to keep the price down. Nokia would not admit it even if they are interested acquiring JNPR. Nokia does not have to report on rumors. They can basically say what they want with regards to rumors of acquisition. Nokia may still be in negotiations and does not want to play their hand to the rest of the market."

"Good Results. The street will like it. Meeting the estimates."" “We experienced encouraging trends during the June quarter, as we saw sequential revenue growth across industry verticals and technologies,” said Rami Rahim, chief executive officer, Juniper Networks. “We are making progress with our sales transformation efforts which, along with our strong pipeline of opportunities, is providing confidence in our ability to not only deliver sequential revenue growth through the remainder of the year, but also a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter.” """
