CDAY is the only payroll company that enables continuous calculation of payroll and tax in real-time. Its aggressive growth strategy combined with the recent drop in share price makes a good entry point for long term investors.

"Like $LSPD and $SHOP, Ceridian offers a value-adding service that pretty much pays for itself. Although the HCM market is getting crowded, switching costs have grown to a level that makes Ceridian’s product offerings look pretty sticky. Over the long haul, I see Ceridian growing by double digits while doing so profitably — something that few cloud-harnessing firms can do these days.In the meantime, Ceridian, like Lightspeed, is facing disruption to its business as a result of COVID-19. An unprecedented surge in unemployment will hit Ceridian over the intermediate term, given it charges on a per-employee basis. Unlike Lightspeed, however, Ceridian is more exposed to larger firms that are better able to survive this crisis.With shares trading at 9.6 times sales, I’d say Ceridian is a bargain for growth investors hungry for high returns."
Ceridan Dayforce is used by my wife’s payroll dept- they hate it.

Cday is trading at 7 times over its book value AND 18 times greater than its sales AND has a negative EPS. Ummmmm it has 2.23% revenue growth. Okay this stock is fat and I’m going to short it. Nooooo way should it be at $93. More like $65. Time to take this pig to market people.
