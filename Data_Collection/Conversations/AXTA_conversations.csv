Time to buy.good stuff coming up.
Give me one compelling reason to own this stock?
Acquisition today. It looks positive. Any thoughts???
2 positive days in a row after earnings is a positive way to end the week. Any predictions on next week?
Any perspective on 3Q earnings results????
"Net leverage ratio of 3.3x at December 31, 2020 versus 3.7x at September 30, 2020; ~$200 million debt pay-down as part of November refinancing; over $1.7 billion in total liquidity available at December 31, 2020!!! CVS will drop below a Net Leverage ratio of 3 this year...pays a 2 dollar dividend (2.8% yield) and trades for less than 10 times EPS. Not sure what Buffett's Todd and Ted are doing here other than chasing a story like so many in the stock market today, not weight bags of cash for a given level of risk."
Whats going on with the sale? Going at a snails pace.....better be high 30’s.......lol
Now she will climb.
Loving this stock!
Looking for good earnings today!!!!
Citi raised the price target to $31.........kinda playing catch-up?
AXTA reached a 52 Week low at 20.35
Hoping Buffet is wrong on Axalta.
"It’s like watching paint dry. According to a Bloomberg article, both the CDR/PPG bid and the Koch/Platinum equity offers are still active but the bids are coming in at $30-$32 only. This price is much lower than the Nippon offer of $37 from 2017. Finally I saw a ton of dark pool transactions just prior to the earnings call and one large on for 538,000 shares on Monday 10/11 at a price of $30.10. While the price now is lower than the price of that dark pool transaction (it is the largest one I have seen on this stock), my view is that the big boys have placed their bets on the long side."
heavy call volume i believe the bidder is coming back to buy this company someone always knows
Berkshire and Soros like it. I don't like them but staying put.
Delay in results is really weird...surprised Berkshire in still invested in this company. No smoke without fire
"The major risk here is that if the offers come in at $37 (previous offer from Nippon) the market will punish the stock. At 15x EBITDA (previous industry deal valuations), AXTA should be valued at $45. Anything less will be viewed negatively. However market conditions are not great either."
Earning are not good along with deceptive BOD and Management that refuses to update their investors regarding the possible sale.

Starting to fall in love with AXTA!
I’ve seen other companies that were going thru buyouts that they made announcements day before or just before earnings. Hoping that happens here also.
Now back to the trip to $50.
Grabbed the $28 SEP Calls on that dip today...Looking good!
Axalta continues to sell off each day.Why doesn't AXTA say something to their shareholders?
"There is some dark pool stuff happening here. TIME AND SALES shows 181,000 share lot ON THE ASK AT 2:26:15, but does not show on volume chart. Any opinions?"
2.1 million shares traded already and it’s not mid day yet. Average daily volume: 2.5 million. This will get exciting when the news breaks.
"Charlie Shaver gone (working next project with Carlyle), Investment Banker now running the company. This company is for sale $7bn price"
Citi reports Axta is primed for a takeover.......that might be helping to move things today.
Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA) PT Raised to $36 at Jefferies
Nice path we are seeing. Maybe we start to see the $37 to $40 range in May.
I think the interest in AXTA is still there expecting a bid for this company at some point would not be surprised if first buyer comes back
An absolute gem of a stock. Love the recent growth. 2021 will be a good year for AXTA!
"It’s two weeks! Let’s get it on.....I need to do my Christmas shopping still. I know I’m getting a car, but not sure if it’s a matchbox or the real thing! Lol"

"Wow, 20% of the value gone in less than a month.....who would have thought. :("
"Nice Mover here. Also want to get in before the rest of the crowd?Want VIP Trade Alerts from a Wall Street Superstar veteran ? Text the word "" VIP "" to 1-833-847-7376 to get these reports for FREE.$SNAP $SPY"
"What I find amazing with this company is that the stock is trading 4 to 5 years ahead of itself. Lidar will happen, and the car paint will change....but the real large scale adoption is years in the future."
Looks like price hasn't budged in 6 years. No dividend. What's the appeal here?
