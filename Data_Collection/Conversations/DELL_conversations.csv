"TAX FREE! The last statement is an important one. ROUND ROCK, Texas, Oct. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) board of directors has approved distribution of a special stock dividend to Dell Technologies stockholders of all its shares of Class A and Class B common stock of VMware, Inc. This represents approximately 81% of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock. Each share of VMware Class B common stock will be converted into one share of VMware Class A common stock in connection with the distribution and prior to the receipt by Dell Technologies stockholders of such shares.The distribution of shares will be made to all Dell Technologies shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. ET on October 29, 2021 (the ""record date""). The distribution will take place in the form of a pro rata common stock dividend to each Dell Technologies shareholder as of the record date. Dell Technologies' spin-off of VMware is expected to be completed on November 1, 2021 (the ""distribution date""), subject to certain conditions.The final distribution ratio will be determined and announced on the record date. It will be calculated by dividing the shares of VMware common stock (or basic shares outstanding) to be distributed by the number of shares of Dell Technologies common stock (or basic shares) outstanding on the record date. Dell Technologies shareholders would receive approximately 0.44 shares of VMware for each share of Dell Technologies that they hold, based on shares outstanding today. No fractional shares of VMware common stock will be distributed. Instead, Dell Technologies shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of VMware common stock that they otherwise would have received. The distribution is generally intended to qualify as tax free to Dell Technologies stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes."

Nice job on earnings Dell! Dell and VMware continue to impress me! I'm hoping I can hold long on both these stocks. Dell has been one of my best Tech Investments yet!
$124 soon
"Hey, they have been walking us down to steal our shares...:("
BUY BUY BUY
"Things are rocking along for those of us DVMT holders who too the stock swap. I did it by accident, but I at least I have something that is on the rise. Cramer just touted DELL on CMBC. He seems to think that it is not properly understood by the market and has a pretty future. I hope so.."
I would start watching how low VMW shares go. If it continues to go lower I expect the spin-off to be impacted because VMW's investor grade rating will suffer dramatically. VMW is down quite a bit again today.
"Wendy: For what it's worth, not selling. Said it before, this is like $DELL at 2 bucks. When ""M's"" $12 range comes along, will take original green out and let it ride - don't chase all the money in the world, catch what you can"
Does this stock ever move

The last day to own this stock to be eligible for the spinoff will be September 30th.I expect the share price to go to $120 by September 30 and spin off to close second week in October
"New SEC filing:1. new $2B stock repurchase2. date of special dividend is (probably) Nov 1st3. special dividend is fixed at $11.5B (that's the lower end of the range given on Apr 14th)Hopefully, (1) drives $VMW higher short term, similar to the effect of stock repurchase announcement on $DELL a couple of weeks back (Sep 23rd IIRC?).Also, the early date in (2) should put pressure on shorts. I believe they will have to pay a huge dividend for the stocks borrowed. (Can someone confirm?).Yahoo indicates there was a big jump in shorts: shorts are now 20.21% of float, which is up 18.5% (from Aug 13 to Sep 15). That's probably related to the unusual higher amount of sells in early Sep.Clearly, paying less dividend is good for $VMW, hence (3) is better than the $12B estimate from April.Obviously, none of this is any official financial advice. Do your own research. Etc etc. But IMHO, short term looks great. Hold your fingers crossed. Ref: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001124610/000112461021000056/vmw-20211007.htm"
So we will still get shares of VMW as long as we purchase shares of Dell before the spin off happens? Will we also receive the dividend for the Dell shares?
"From my math, Dell appears to be drastically undervaluing the VMW tracking stock (ie. DVMT) to his/their benefit for our cash option (ie. $109/share), and overvaluing the resultant DHI corp (so our share ratio of 1.36....is on the low side). Dell appears to be literally getting their cake and eating it too, benefiting on both sides. Again, my opinion....but I encourage every DVMT holder to read today's BLOOMBERG article ""Dell's Buyout Math Doesn't quite compute"". Dell appears to have valued their own shares in the $30 range only recently, and now they're trying to pawn it off fo 4 X that value. I guess it's a good gig if you can get away with it. Needless to say, I am going to vote against the deal on these premises. They need to offer cash far closer to VMW's share price, &/or a far higher DHI-to-DVMT share ratio, to even be remotely fair. DVMT was issued as part of EMC deal so that shareholders could benefit by VMW's success as an independent company. DVMT value was held down for fear that Dell would do something like this, and thus the 29% 'premium' is against an artificially low price to begin with. Don't vote to sell your shares at $0.69 on the dollar just because of an offer based on an artificially low price."
Why are people selling? That was a great report.
hearing/reading a lot of information about the upcoming spin-off. Currently own 400 shares of DELL from EMC days. rumor is .44 shares of VMW to 100 DELL. Am I correct to say that I would receive 176 shares of VMW? sounds way too good.
$140 by Fri 10/29.
Let us not forget that owners will have to deal with the proper allocation of some of your basis in Dell to the VMware shares allocated to you.
I smile everytime this stock goes down. Personal reasons. I'll tell you from the inside....it is not what it seems. Short.
What happened??
Horrendous

"I would take a look at the Netap and AWS deal pertaining to storage just recently. Pure Storage ,Netap, and the Hyper-scalers are squezing out Dell EMC each year. Once Dell loses Vmware's revenue Dell will show itself as a declining low margin company, despite acquiring more of VMW cash to pay down debt. There will be no cash cow in the future to help Dell EMC out."
#dell$110
$120 in 30 days....
"So there is a lot of talk on the spinoff for Dell holders...I've read the SEC filing and read the posts on here and my question is surrounding the special dividend that says it will be paid to dell holders too...then the .44 shares of VMW upon closing. Understand the posts thinking it's a double dip, getting both the shares and the special cash dividend...but that seems too good to be true. Without public shaming can anyone shed light on this for me. TIA."
The countdown starts! .44 of vmw is on the way.
Dell reached an all time high at 113.09
"Using current prices, in two days, you receive $57.20/share of VMW. That is a 52% gain. And, it is TAX FREE!"
well i bought another 500 shares at 95.85. Wish me luck
"With Dell selling 80% of it VMware shares, will it share value go to $38 post spin off. If you know the answer, please reply"
Really Dell?
"After a comprehensive review of potential strategic options, both parties determined that this transaction will simplify capital structures and create additional long-term enterprise value. At the transaction closing, VMware will distribute a special cash dividend of $11.5 - $12 billion to all VMware shareholders, including Dell Technologies. Based on Dell Technologies' current 80.6% ownership in VMware, Dell Technologies would receive approximately $9.3 - $9.7 billion and intends to use the net proceeds to pay down debt, positioning the company well for Investment Grade ratings.At the transaction closing, Dell Technologies shareholders would receive approximately 0.44 shares of VMware for each share of Dell Technologies that they hold, based on shares outstanding today. The final ratio is subject to incremental dilution prior to the transaction close. VMware will shift from a multiclass to a single class share structure while Dell Technologies' share structure remains the same."
"How much will DELL's stock price drop , when the spin off of the .44 shares of VMW are are distributed? Thanks for a reply."
"According to Barrons today in order to get the VMWare dividend you needed to own the shares as of March 16. They did not give a date for Dell shareholder of record for receiving the VMWare shares (.44?). According to Dell website it says April 14th (""At the transaction closing, Dell Technologies shareholders would receive approximately 0.44 shares of VMware for each share of Dell Technologies that they hold, based on shares outstanding today.""). Does anyone have different insight?"
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/dell/
"Here is the straight inside scoop from the top of the totem pole:Whether you get VMware shares from your ownership in Dell will be determined by the record date. The record and close dates have yet to be announced. The record date should be relatively close to the timing of the close, and the close timing should be early November.Easy peasy..."
Bleeding…
What is wrong with Dell today? 
"News forthcoming:1. There will be two dates announced. One is the date of record; the second is the close date.2. The two dates will be close together.3. If you own 100 Dell shares on the 'Date of Record', you will receive 44 VMW shares. 4. Using today's VMX price, each Dell share will be worth an additional $65. The ballpark math on that is $148ish x .44 = $65ish.5. Using today's Dell price of $103ish, you stand to make a 60% gain.6. The date of record is expected to be Nov 2nd with a close date of Nov 5th. 7. Starting November 8, VMWare will be on it's own. It is a fantastic product."

"Dell’s technical support is awful, it use to be so good, really sad that almost every area of their technical support has been outsourced to other countries."
Does anyone who chose the option conversion have your DVMT shares with Vanguard? Are you seeing the conversion yet? In general do we have any idea how long it will take for Dell to send the information to our brokers?
C’mon man!

"OK guys, any thoughts as to how best to play this.....I imagine we will have a choice between cash ($109) or DHI shares (1.33....). The key has always been trying to decipher as to what is best for shareholder Michael Dell. I don't think this is any different. With that in mind, and in the spirit of 'Let's Make a Deal"", do we take the cash in hand r what's behind curatin #2 (ie. new DHI shares). Thx!"

"Just to ensure that I'm understanding this deal. If I own 100 shares of Dell in early November....on the magic day, I will then own 100 shares of Dell, plus 44ish shares of VMX?"
I expect the VMW majority stakeholder deal to be extended longer because I personally think the majority stakeholders forced the deal on VMW and thought the stocks would go up for both companies. VMW has gone down quite a bit and I think VMW is afraid they will lose their Investment grade ratings if they are not very careful. The reason for VMW recent decline is next years forecast is lower than expected in regards to parts of the business model is not paying off based off investment expectations. The initial forecast for the deal to close was for September and most recently it is now November after VMW next year forecasts but is not affirmative. I expect another delay because VMW stock is continually declining. I forgot to mention there was an extra 6 Billion bond offering to help out that I was not aware of pushed through because of the free cash flow for the next three or more years paying for the deal appears to be a concern for cash flow alone. Stagnation for VMW for possibly up to five years after the deal is finalized because of free cash flow not a versatile option any more. The way the stock price for VMW plays out could impact the Dell deal mainly because VMW doesnt want to lose its Investment Grade Status. Dell EMC wants to achieve investment grade status but it is looking like it might be at the expense of VMW. Just my own thoughts. Good Luck Everyone!
Never buy peak! Bag holders
"after this report, I am spending my rent money to buy dell. $130 in one month"
Come on! Buy more shares!
Looks like Oct 29th is the VMware distribution date for all Dell Class C shareholders
Nice comeback from this morning. 
anyone knows when VMW shares will be distributed?

Sxit talking heads are playing down.
"As a new holder of Dell. from the conversion from DVMT,. I get little hopeful every time Dell seems to be hearing up. The premarket has it pointed up today, so I am hopeful. once again.O the more loglical side, I should probably sell out and get into some better item.So,. anyone got any thoughts of what to nimbly jump to? Other than to the QQQ's?A jump would result in cap gains, so I need to be thoughtful.js"
They are shorting it to get it cheap.
"8K of 10-7 and connected filings. As best as I can determine they were going to say something but forgot to. I think this is correct. Read them yourself, the link is on Dell's site under sec filings. Read them until your stomach turns the third time. That will be enough. Lawyers are really strange folks."
"Has anyone figured out how many shares of new DELL we will get? For those of us who elected cash, I think I know how much cash we will get (multiply your # of DVMT shares by 0.6414and then multiply that by $120). But I'm not entirely clear about the other side of the equation....ie. how many shares of DELL we will end up with (which is nicely plummeting in price (from $46) as we speak). If anyone has thoughts, feel free to share."
how can you go wrong....currently Below Fair Value: DELL ($108.65) is trading below our estimate fair value ($185.39)....and Below Fair Value: VMW ($157.38) is trading below our estimate of fair value ($277.56)...
Dell reached an all time high at 114.66

really interested to see this price monday - i really have no idea what to expect!
"I no longer will be purchasing any Dell products. I have been trying to buy a Dell Vostro for my company directly from them (online) for the past 6 days. I have never seen a worse ordering/inventory system and customer support service in my life. (Except maybe AT&T but at least I got the AT&T product in the end).I was just informed that my order was canceled inexplicably by Dell. I only learned this by proactively contact them AFTER my delivery date came and went and nothing arrived. I probably spent 6 hours on hold, on the phone, or on chat over the past 3 days. End result - order canceled with no explanation.I know this is a stock message board but if this is any indication of how the company operates, I'd recommend selling the stock."
Easy green day tomorrow. AH volume only 70k. Average daily volume is 1.9 million.
I know we get .44 shares of VMW. Do we also get a cash dividend?Thanks
C’mon man!! 
Dell is down 4.94% to 96.53

Dell is broken?

New opportunities opening up. Dell is a winner.
"why somebody from dell selling almost 700,000k shares ???"
"I still am not getting it. DVMT going away, and the deal expected to close on 12/28. The value should be closing on that price, no? It's 13 trading days away. If DVMT holders and buyers thought it would worth anywhere near this, it should be over $115 by now. Clearly, the market thinks even this deal isn't quite worth anywhere near $120."
If I purchased the 43 shares of DVMT on Wednesday(12/26 around $80 per share). Are they going to give me back the same amounts (43 shares of) DELL ($45 per share)? I just open my investment account and it shows the money I invested in DVMT dropped by half. Is the conversion ratio of 1.8 only applied to shares that were purchased earlier? Thanks
$DELL cuts revenue forecast due to $INTC chip shortage. That can’t be sitting well with Dell and their investors. A switch to AMD coming???
Really Dell? 
"Has anyone noticed with the Dell common now nearing $67.00 that those who last December selected the stock option rather than the cash option now have pretty much closed that massive gap that existed when the deal closed. Those of us that took cash plus pro rated stock wound up with around $77.00,share in cash and another $29.00/share in Dell stock for our VWare tracking stock. Those who took the cash wound up with $81.00 in Dell stock. With the almost 50% rise in the common since the closing their at the time all stock deal has pretty much brought them even BTW-There are two Philips posting here. I am the one who goes all the way back to EMC just after the epic early 2000's crash and was not at all happy with how Michael Dell grabbed EMC.I held until the very end and now have Dell Common. Can only wonder what a stand alone EMC would go for now. Dell paid $29.05 for it when he bought them out"
Looks like the big secret has leaked out.
Presumably there are some Dell Shareholders selling covered calls ? Forward on the no of VMware they expect to receive to protect their value on the expected VM . VM would presumably fall after the special dividend is paid out by as much as USD 25 ? Who has thoughts / a strategy on this ?
Ummm...down $21 at the open? What happened?
I don’t understand why the stock is down but imagine is has more to do with VMWare’s earnings report than Dell itself.
When do we get the new stocks?

Over the years I own several Dell computers still using a dell desktop with window 7. Still using dell lap top. I will not in invest in this company. I just don’t trust Michael Dell.
"Question: As DELL shareholders. Will we be directly getting any of the special dividend $s that VMW is paying out? or is that only going to VMW shareholders, and of course, good ol Michael Dell / Silver Lake? If we are, do you interpret that as approx. $27 per DELL share, or per converted VMW shares you will be receiving (ie. .44 x your number of DELL shares). Thanks."
If i buy dell stock now. May i get the 0.44 shares vmw later ?

Shares of Dell Technologies (DELL) - Get Dell Technologies Inc Class C Report were higher after the tech giant's stock was added to Goldman Sachs's Americas Conviction List with a $137 price target.
"The folks buying into DELL now are getting it on the cheap. Those of us who were DVMT holders, have the dual misfortune of (1) incurring capital gains from our low starting point, and (2) in REALITY, being still underwater due to the funny math that was used to convert DVMT into DELL. ie. $80 / sh.....and of course that $80 is nowhere close to the $120 that was the headline grabber for what the media was fed. And that $120 was woefully inadequate for a VWM tracker....ie. If you'd really like to get your blood pressure up, look at VMW's price now of $170, and that is AFTER throwing out a $9 billion divy. If you are a new DELL buyer, congrats.....but for us ex-DVMT holders, we had our pockets emptied by subversive/share-holder UN-friendly corporate governance, and we have a while to go to even 'break even' with the value we had taken out of our pockets and into the pockets of those whom DVMT had been entrusted to for their stewardship........don't forget that."
Very nice full page story in Barron's yesterday
why are they selling? market is FORWARD looking
Have till tomorrow COB to get on board.
"Some analysts seem to be doing their research but the market and commentators are struggling to understand this company structure and the broad market it plays in. Financially strong and getting stronger. Dell delivered an EPS beat, revenue is up in a number of multi-billion dollar markets, 7% in storage, 5% in Client Solutions, 11% in VMWare. Aggressive pay down of debt, near 18 billion paid down to date, whilst still managing 500million+ in income in Q3. And gaining market share in an evolving IT,storage,cloud, etc market predicted independantly to grow 5% CAGR. Whats not to like."
