really interested to see this price monday - i really have no idea what to expect!
Looks like Oct 29th is the VMware distribution date for all Dell Class C shareholders
how can you go wrong....currently Below Fair Value: DELL ($108.65) is trading below our estimate fair value ($185.39)....and Below Fair Value: VMW ($157.38) is trading below our estimate of fair value ($277.56)...
"News forthcoming:1. There will be two dates announced. One is the date of record; the second is the close date.2. The two dates will be close together.3. If you own 100 Dell shares on the 'Date of Record', you will receive 44 VMW shares. 4. Using today's VMX price, each Dell share will be worth an additional $65. The ballpark math on that is $148ish x .44 = $65ish.5. Using today's Dell price of $103ish, you stand to make a 60% gain.6. The date of record is expected to be Nov 2nd with a close date of Nov 5th. 7. Starting November 8, VMWare will be on it's own. It is a fantastic product."
"Why would anyone sell today, when you'll receive a $50/share door prize next Friday?"
"Using current prices, in two days, you receive $57.20/share of VMW. That is a 52% gain. And, it is TAX FREE!"
"TAX FREE! Last call. Within 8 hours, we're going to stacking the bills."
"New SEC filing:1. new $2B stock repurchase2. date of special dividend is (probably) Nov 1st3. special dividend is fixed at $11.5B (that's the lower end of the range given on Apr 14th)Hopefully, (1) drives $VMW higher short term, similar to the effect of stock repurchase announcement on $DELL a couple of weeks back (Sep 23rd IIRC?).Also, the early date in (2) should put pressure on shorts. I believe they will have to pay a huge dividend for the stocks borrowed. (Can someone confirm?).Yahoo indicates there was a big jump in shorts: shorts are now 20.21% of float, which is up 18.5% (from Aug 13 to Sep 15). That's probably related to the unusual higher amount of sells in early Sep.Clearly, paying less dividend is good for $VMW, hence (3) is better than the $12B estimate from April.Obviously, none of this is any official financial advice. Do your own research. Etc etc. But IMHO, short term looks great. Hold your fingers crossed. Ref: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001124610/000112461021000056/vmw-20211007.htm"

"You have 75 minutes Nikki. Buy now, and get the WMWare...all 100% tax free.Mortgage the house,take the money you've been saving for the heart transplant, empty the kid's college funds. Buy Buy Buy!"
The countdown starts! .44 of vmw is on the way.

I have Dell 100 call options expiration Jan 22.How will that be handled after the disbursement of the dividend and the 0.44 share WM software per Dell share?Anybody have any ideas?
Are VMW shares distributed based on open or close of market on Friday?

Very nice full page story in Barron's yesterday
"How much will DELL's stock price drop , when the spin off of the .44 shares of VMW are are distributed? Thanks for a reply."
