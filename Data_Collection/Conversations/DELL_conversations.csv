I will be more than happy even if it drops to 50. Good chance to accumulate more before the VMWare spin-off.
I don’t understand why the stock is down but imagine is has more to do with VMWare’s earnings report than Dell itself.
shall i buy dell or vmw?
why are they selling? market is FORWARD looking
C’mon Dell!! 
"There is something going on with this stock. Lately such low volume and price is being pushed down on low volume!! Is there a buyer's strike? OR is it some kind of conspiracy by big money trying to buy DELL stock cheap from retail investors? Or is it arbitrage hangover? This name is NOT tracking VMW stock price even remotely!! For every Single percentage increase of VMW price, DELL price should go up approximately 0.5% because DELL shareholders own about 50% of VMW shares. Why is it not doing that? It smells fishy."
"see what vmware gave out tax free return of connecte investment 3 years ago...same? but this time dell is giving dell shareholders .44 vmw shares/dell share......the prime beneficiary is micheal dell.......as i understand. once out of dells moat, vmware can surpass it's hi.....no more free money to please mdell....and it can go make other deals.....buy now pay later is big and paypal is a longtime associate of vmware. apple and paidy; paypal buying paidy........wags.......apple needs a pay option to show the regulators.wags."
Im surprised that Dells 2.5 billion dollar(yes thats a B) contract didnt even tickle that stock value.
"After parsing through the results, I'm encouraged, mostly because of commentary around it's $1billion buyback. People, this is trading at 0.3X sales and 6X future earnings. Company, now has a positive book value, paid down over $5bb in debt and continues to generate large amounts of Leveraged Free Cash Flow. The servers business wasn't as bad as it's industry peers-- they continue to take share-- and expect a rebound in the coming quarters. Great PC sales which are expected to temper with the exhaustion of the Windows upgrade cycle. And, continued growth in it VMW unit."
"Be careful with Micheal Dell, It was a 20 yr holding for me when he decided to go private and paid me out a rather poor price for my shares. He could do it again anytime."
If I purchased the 43 shares of DVMT on Wednesday(12/26 around $80 per share). Are they going to give me back the same amounts (43 shares of) DELL ($45 per share)? I just open my investment account and it shows the money I invested in DVMT dropped by half. Is the conversion ratio of 1.8 only applied to shares that were purchased earlier? Thanks
Dell net debt is $36 billion. VMWare stake is worth $53 billion. Dell is essentially trading at negative 17 billion enterprise value ex VMWare stake.And negative 17 billion EV business generates 80 billion in revenue and 3-4 billion of cash flow. Just imagine that!
"I think VMW's jump up today, which dwarf's DVMT's, says it all. Remember, DVMT was sold to EMC shareholders as the greatest tracker ever, to allow for participation in VMW's success....and even to the bitter end, we've been played. Hopefully Icahn will offer a better deal to DVMT holders and force Dell's hand. I'm voting 'No'. We deserved, and still deserve, better."
"DELL announced two new VxRails systems that it says extend the benefits of hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), like automation and simplified operations, to remote and space-constrained edge locations. Also, this business could possibly meet the demand of electric vehicles for cobalt. Lear more: http://psce.pw/NextMajorUSIndustry"
Why it is so hard for this to go beyond 45 ..
"As a new holder of Dell. from the conversion from DVMT,. I get little hopeful every time Dell seems to be hearing up. The premarket has it pointed up today, so I am hopeful. once again.O the more loglical side, I should probably sell out and get into some better item.So,. anyone got any thoughts of what to nimbly jump to? Other than to the QQQ's?A jump would result in cap gains, so I need to be thoughtful.js"
"I apologize in advance for the dumb question, but, I'm trying to get a handle for what the trading relationship should be between DVMT and VMW.As I understand it, DVMT represents 53% of the value of VMW. So, at VMW $120, shouldn't DVMT be $63.60? ($120 * .53)If DVMT is currently trading at a discount, as I keep reading that it is, then, I clearly am missing something.If anyone knows how to calculate what should be fair value for DVMT based on the VMW price, I'd be grateful for a response.Thanks,"
"if they role Dell into DVMT , one,would hope that current owners get something to sweeten the pot, otherwise we go from being a tracking stock of a growing company to a stockholder of a company with 40 billion in debt..."
"From my math, Dell appears to be drastically undervaluing the VMW tracking stock (ie. DVMT) to his/their benefit for our cash option (ie. $109/share), and overvaluing the resultant DHI corp (so our share ratio of 1.36....is on the low side). Dell appears to be literally getting their cake and eating it too, benefiting on both sides. Again, my opinion....but I encourage every DVMT holder to read today's BLOOMBERG article ""Dell's Buyout Math Doesn't quite compute"". Dell appears to have valued their own shares in the $30 range only recently, and now they're trying to pawn it off fo 4 X that value. I guess it's a good gig if you can get away with it. Needless to say, I am going to vote against the deal on these premises. They need to offer cash far closer to VMW's share price, &/or a far higher DHI-to-DVMT share ratio, to even be remotely fair. DVMT was issued as part of EMC deal so that shareholders could benefit by VMW's success as an independent company. DVMT value was held down for fear that Dell would do something like this, and thus the 29% 'premium' is against an artificially low price to begin with. Don't vote to sell your shares at $0.69 on the dollar just because of an offer based on an artificially low price."
Dell is down 4.94% to 96.53
Presumably there are some Dell Shareholders selling covered calls ? Forward on the no of VMware they expect to receive to protect their value on the expected VM . VM would presumably fall after the special dividend is paid out by as much as USD 25 ? Who has thoughts / a strategy on this ?
why is this bearish ?!
Load and relax!
Dell must take market shares from HPE. look at HPE AH.
Great ER and VMW also did well.
hearing/reading a lot of information about the upcoming spin-off. Currently own 400 shares of DELL from EMC days. rumor is .44 shares of VMW to 100 DELL. Am I correct to say that I would receive 176 shares of VMW? sounds way too good.
Bought more
The last day to own this stock to be eligible for the spinoff will be September 30th.I expect the share price to go to $120 by September 30 and spin off to close second week in October
Who is buying into ER?
I own both Dell and HP. It's amazing how the two stocks reacted. HP wasn't that bad and got crushed. Dell's was ok and soared. Not sure why they had to cut their 401k contributions. Looks like they could afford it. Kinda mean really.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-demand-remained-strong-second-123000218.html
Am I the only one who finds it odd that such a huge arbitrage opportunity is just left to sit for so long?
"after this report, I am spending my rent money to buy dell. $130 in one month"
"long term buy...great opportunity to get in which I just took...forward PE under 7 and solid earnings. the debt seems to be the concern but it's because they own 82% of WMware. in theory if they were worried about their debt, they could easily cut loose some VMW stock. the Intel issue is just a short term blip."
Would someone explain to me why you would want to invest in Dell ?
"why is DELL, VMW not participating in tech rally? any clue?"
"I still am not getting it. DVMT going away, and the deal expected to close on 12/28. The value should be closing on that price, no? It's 13 trading days away. If DVMT holders and buyers thought it would worth anywhere near this, it should be over $115 by now. Clearly, the market thinks even this deal isn't quite worth anywhere near $120."
"under Pat G. VMW revenue tripled in 8 years. if this is not growth then, what exactly you are looking?"
"Seriously the worst computer manufacturer that ever existed in the United States. The problem is - they virtually have a monopoly and as a result without real competition - will continue to deliver lousy service, with incomplete manufacturing techniques that let consumers fend for themselves to fix. Long for the days in the past where companies like Big Blue or HP could produce products to compete with the likes of Dell. Sad."
"Wendy: For what it's worth, not selling. Said it before, this is like $DELL at 2 bucks. When ""M's"" $12 range comes along, will take original green out and let it ride - don't chase all the money in the world, catch what you can"
"Goldman Sachs increased its price target on the stock to $96 from $68. Dell has an average rating of outperform and price targets ranging from $65 to $96, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ. The stock was up 3.30% in Tuesday's premarket trading."
Dell’s debt seems to hold the stock price down but EMC and VMW were well worth it. Earnings reports should be strong. They are an essential cog in the new world.
"II noticed this was a #1 Zacks selection so I signed on to my Merrill Edge account and pulled it up and saw they had/have a $63 price target on it. Whether by chance or whether he monitors Zacks rankings himself, Cramer happened to mention it on his show that night saying something like ""Dell is just way too cheap at this level...."" So, between the three I jumped in and bought 1,000 shares at $44.75 on 1/23. It's up 20% and I'm comfortable sticking in to about $60 but I may take my money and go home then - just wish I'd bought more! Why sell rather than hold on? From the posts below it seems like there's potentially too much monkey business/inside baloney happening and since I'm on the outside I don't want any part of it. As a side note it's now fallen a notch and is carries a Zacks #2 rating."
"The problem with owning Dell after the VMWare spin-off is Dell is a very low margin company. Michael Dell & Silver Lake continually had the option for VMWare to bail out Dell by continually monopolizing on VMWare as the piggy bank. Well, The piggy bank goes away in September for Dell. Michael Dell & Silver Lake make out like bandits. VMWare's cash is pretty much gone for the next three years so all companies can leave VMWare in the dust in regards VMware stuck in stagnation. If you go back and look at the history of how Michael Dell and Silver Lake treat shareholders Dell and VMware stock will be like Kodak as someone mentioned below. If things start to go south you cannot trust the majority stakeholders."
Bleeding…
"OK guys, any thoughts as to how best to play this.....I imagine we will have a choice between cash ($109) or DHI shares (1.33....). The key has always been trying to decipher as to what is best for shareholder Michael Dell. I don't think this is any different. With that in mind, and in the spirit of 'Let's Make a Deal"", do we take the cash in hand r what's behind curatin #2 (ie. new DHI shares). Thx!"
May i ask if i buy 100 shares Dell today and will receive 0.44 x 100 shares VMware in end of this year or no? Thanks so much
Buy now since earning report is coming in 2 days??
"So far all I've found on the tax implication is: Per the election information booklet, ""Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences to US Holders of Class V Common Stock"" beginning on Page 218 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (Dated 10/19/2018). There is a discussion on page 220 for exchange of the Class V common shares to combination of cash and Class C Common Stock. Unfortunately it is in lawyerize. Hopefully at some point Dell will issue an IRS Form 8937."
"Has anyone noticed with the Dell common now nearing $67.00 that those who last December selected the stock option rather than the cash option now have pretty much closed that massive gap that existed when the deal closed. Those of us that took cash plus pro rated stock wound up with around $77.00,share in cash and another $29.00/share in Dell stock for our VWare tracking stock. Those who took the cash wound up with $81.00 in Dell stock. With the almost 50% rise in the common since the closing their at the time all stock deal has pretty much brought them even BTW-There are two Philips posting here. I am the one who goes all the way back to EMC just after the epic early 2000's crash and was not at all happy with how Michael Dell grabbed EMC.I held until the very end and now have Dell Common. Can only wonder what a stand alone EMC would go for now. Dell paid $29.05 for it when he bought them out"
"Got my proxy today.....voted to NOT throw my hard-earned money away to entities who do not appear to have DVMT tracking holders' best interests in mind (not to mention completely disregarding the intent and assurances of being a VMW tracker), per the critical, and quite astute link below. Here's hoping us 'little guys' can make our voices heard.....just a shame we have to feel like we're being robbed by our supposed advocates to have to do it. So, look at VMW's share price.....envision that as rightly being DVMT's, and don't forget to vote! https://finance.yahoo.com/m/78cec04a-7249-39d9-8cb2-c5f318fea0ab/carl-icahn-is-right-about.html"
is this dell stock any good?
"Has anyone given much thought as to what they plan on doing with the DELL shares they are issued 12/28? Would be interesting for everyone to tally below their intent......Buy, Sell, or Hold. I'm undecided at this point.....I'm currently somewhere in that purgatory between immediate unloading vs a tentative Hold. We will be benefiting by a higher (perhaps highest) share ratio (1.8 DELL per DVMT)....so that's a potential plus on the Hold side. Will be interesting to listen in on the call tomorrow. I encourage everyone to do so.....so we can share our takes on it. Good luck, everyone.....esp. those of us sold the proverbial bill of good from the EMC merger."
"""The Dell Technologies tracking stock for VMware is rallying Wednesday amid reports that the company is near a deal to sweeten its current $21.7 billion offer for the tracking stock to a range of $120 to $130 a share."" All I need is a closing price on Jan 18 of $110 or higher, for my option spread to pay off on Dell a second time."
"Apparently consumer sales went up but enterprise went down. Quite interesting. I'm going long on this one, enterprise sales will go up as more businesses start issuing laptops (equipped with VMWARE for remote work...yes i'm bullish on VMW too! haha)"
"As software eats hardware phenomena continues to take hold, next 10 years will be very interesting to watch. The need for beefy and custom hardware for specific workloads doesn't arise as software becomes more capable and intelligent. Dell, HPE and other server vendors shrink going forward and their margins shrinking much faster. What HPE and Dell are doing right now is to move into subscription model and convert their existing customers into monthly subscribers based on beefy and expensive hardware. Eventually, they will use software and replace expensive hardware beneath with cheap commodity servers. But they will still get paid higher for their hardware. Smart move, if they actually do it. In this next 10 years journey Dell, HPE, VMware and Nutanix will have bright future assuming they can put brakes to big 5 AWS, azure, Google, Oracle and Alibaba.In this journey HPE and Nutanix seems far ahead and Dell/VMware has few hurdles to cross. This is a very simplistic take, but I am positive that every enterprise will take advantage of innovation already at play with AWS, google, Facebook etc.What $csco will do here, I have no idea. $dell, $hpe, $vmw"
Does this stock ever move
Dell just got put on blast for legitimately scamming the most influential tech reviewer worldwide.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go5tLO6ipxw
Beats by .66 on a 1.49 basis=2.15. Rev's also beat expectations 23.37B vs 23.32B.
Why are people selling? That was a great report.
well i bought another 500 shares at 95.85. Wish me luck
If they time the spin-off announcement properly (like right about now) this stock would go up another 15-20% in a single day based on momentum from the news alone...
"about 90 days ago Dell APPROVED and made a $1 BILLION dollar buyback of stock!NOW - that can't match retirement pay, freeze hiring and much more!This is the REAL Michael Dell!!!Not even adding in the MASSIVE amount he made bring DELL public for the 2nd TIME!"
"hearing brokerages are not allowing shorting of VMW and Dell""No shares left to Short""- What does that mean??"
Ummm...down $21 at the open? What happened?
"I am still waiting to get this conversion business done.I had 200 shs of DVMT Foolishly will be getting just the share conversion option, So How many shares should I be getting? 200 x 1.8066 = 361 (more or less) ? My calculation.But I have had my 200 DVMT shares swaped for only 110 new DELL's.That is not anywhere close to right is it?"

"My school board meeting yesterday said they were in negotiations with Dell and HP trying to order 50,000 laptops. They said both were backed up and that they would continue to work on it. Now just extrapolate that number across the country and add in parents that are buying new laptops too. Can only imagine there are massive numbers of laptops moving. Ancillary side benefit of being able to move older models and or slightly less desirable hardware/models. When you have volume and some measure of price control results should be good."
BUY BUY BUY
So spin off record date? Anyone have an idea?
Dell stocks have a Black Friday price
Always gaps up to analyst targets in few weeks .. now October and September slow months in stock market ... Buying more
$120 in 30 days....
"Has anyone figured out how many shares of new DELL we will get? For those of us who elected cash, I think I know how much cash we will get (multiply your # of DVMT shares by 0.6414and then multiply that by $120). But I'm not entirely clear about the other side of the equation....ie. how many shares of DELL we will end up with (which is nicely plummeting in price (from $46) as we speak). If anyone has thoughts, feel free to share."
C’mon man! 
"After a comprehensive review of potential strategic options, both parties determined that this transaction will simplify capital structures and create additional long-term enterprise value. At the transaction closing, VMware will distribute a special cash dividend of $11.5 - $12 billion to all VMware shareholders, including Dell Technologies. Based on Dell Technologies' current 80.6% ownership in VMware, Dell Technologies would receive approximately $9.3 - $9.7 billion and intends to use the net proceeds to pay down debt, positioning the company well for Investment Grade ratings.At the transaction closing, Dell Technologies shareholders would receive approximately 0.44 shares of VMware for each share of Dell Technologies that they hold, based on shares outstanding today. The final ratio is subject to incremental dilution prior to the transaction close. VMware will shift from a multiclass to a single class share structure while Dell Technologies' share structure remains the same."
#$%$ stock this is
Good earnings call.
"Exact quote during call: ""We are in the early stages of a technology-led investment cycle. IT spending remains healthy and our business drivers remain strong,"" said Jeff Clarke, vice chairman, Dell Technologies. ""We are innovating and integrating across the Dell Technologies portfolio, from the edge to the core to the cloud, with a diverse business designed to succeed in any macro environment.

"I would have thought all the working from home and shopping online would be good for Dell or at least better than most, guess not"
Really Dell?
Very positive article in Barron's pM5. Calls DVMT a cheap way to own VMware.
"At the transaction closing, Dell Technologies shareholders would receive approximately 0.44 shares of VMware for each share of Dell Technologies that they hold, based on shares outstanding today. The final ratio is subject to incremental dilution prior to the transaction close. VMware will shift from a multiclass to a single class share structure while Dell Technologies' share structure remains the same."
Not worried but HP reported and there PC sales were flat causing concern whether PC sales have peaked. Dell is gaining market share most likely at HP's expense
Should I sell? Or hold?
I think this has the ability to continue an upward trend. With earnings coming up a runup is possible especially with Dell owning VMWare and with the switch to home computing. Any opinions on this?
"Dell owns 81% of VMW. VMW's market cap is $69.5B; thus, Dell's share is worth $56B. Meanwhile, Dell's market cap is $39.5B. Buying Dell at its current valuation is a no brainer. If Dell were valued based ONLY on the value of its share of VMW, Dell would be selling for something like $80/share."
I elected all cash. Received cash and Dell stock combined value average of $105.00 per share of DVMT. Far short of $120.00 as was voted. DVMT holders got jacked!
Why? Insider dumping?
"The Jan $110 call closed at 80 cents bid. The market is either saying the deal will fall through, or at least won't be closed by January."
"If there is a class action lawsuit against Dell for robbing DVMT shareholders, I want to be a part of it. Even though I have elected cash in one of my brokerage, I know it will be a combination of cash and DELL stocks since they only have $14B which does not meet all cash only elections. Check out http://www.investors.delltechnologies.com website for information on Dell's valuation and estimated price of a DELL stock. The ratio they have come up with is 1.8 which strips 25% value from DVMT shares upon closure of this transaction. Like that retail investors like us will lose at least 25% on this deal. The odds of DELL going down right after public trading starts is quite high considering the market sentiment and DVMT holders wanting to sell the new stocks for tax-loss harvesting. I have no idea why the institutional investors agreed to this proposal in the first place! I hope Dell doesn't give any preferential treatment to Carl Icahn and other large investors wherein they get $120 for each DVMT but smaller investors get 1.8x DELL stock at a much less value compared to the original investment."
Dell is headed to $90 by the end of this year and $120-$140 one year from now. Mark this post.
"Dell enterprise value is $101 billion. VMW enterprise value is $60 billion. Dell owns 81% of Vmware. Vmware has almost no debt. If Michael Dell spins off Vmware to Dell shareholders, then VMW stock will lose its discount to other software stocks which arises from Dell's controlling interest, and Dell shareholders will reap a windfall. Dell stock still trades at a big discount to the broader market, so the potential value creation isn't yet fully reflected in Dell's stock price. I'm betting that Michael Dell will ultimately succeed in getting VMW stock spun off from Dell so that the discount will abate. Why wouldn't he want to spin out Vmware shares to Dell stockholders? Michael Dell owns 5.6 million DELL common shares."
Cloud business is going to help Dell.
Nice.. first stop: 51.. breaking the resistance and then hopefully further to 53... waiting to long for this
it may still close green today. Not worried yet.
Really Dell? 
"The market just figured out JPM and Tamasek schemed to make money off Temasek pulling out of US. Tamesek consults JPM overseas so when Tamasek wanted out of US, they shorted and JPM analysts downgraded the stocks pointing out petty flaws in business plans. They did this to just about 51 stock in US including Dell. The news came out yesterday they sold their positions and now everyone JPM and Tamaesek joined forces to push the stocks down. This total BS. JPM is the fake news of analysts."

"Don't sell any Dell Share. Buying Dell stock is the best thing to do now. You will never loose with the spinoff in Sep 2021.When you buy 1 Dell Stock you get 0.44 of VM Ware stock + $27 Dividend 1 Share Dell - at current Price $930.44 Share of VM - $66Dividend - $27Total is $93So even if Dell Stock goes down to $1 in September you will not loose money. If Dell stock stays at $93 in September. You will get a profit of $93 What happens if you buy 1000 Shares of Dell at $93This will be big money for you in September after the spin off.You will get 440 shares of VM for free - $66,000 + 27000 DividendBig Hedge funds know all of this and trying to buy your shares."
"If they announce the spin-off tomorrow, the implied value of the spin-off is about +$65 / share in upside for Dell Shareholders. That’s assuming Michael Dell doesn’t financially engineer the deal so that we get nothing and he gets everything like with the old EMC tracking stock."
why it falls?
Is this stock going to dip further?
"Things are rocking along for those of us DVMT holders who too the stock swap. I did it by accident, but I at least I have something that is on the rise. Cramer just touted DELL on CMBC. He seems to think that it is not properly understood by the market and has a pretty future. I hope so.."
I expect the VMW majority stakeholder deal to be extended longer because I personally think the majority stakeholders forced the deal on VMW and thought the stocks would go up for both companies. VMW has gone down quite a bit and I think VMW is afraid they will lose their Investment grade ratings if they are not very careful. The reason for VMW recent decline is next years forecast is lower than expected in regards to parts of the business model is not paying off based off investment expectations. The initial forecast for the deal to close was for September and most recently it is now November after VMW next year forecasts but is not affirmative. I expect another delay because VMW stock is continually declining. I forgot to mention there was an extra 6 Billion bond offering to help out that I was not aware of pushed through because of the free cash flow for the next three or more years paying for the deal appears to be a concern for cash flow alone. Stagnation for VMW for possibly up to five years after the deal is finalized because of free cash flow not a versatile option any more. The way the stock price for VMW plays out could impact the Dell deal mainly because VMW doesnt want to lose its Investment Grade Status. Dell EMC wants to achieve investment grade status but it is looking like it might be at the expense of VMW. Just my own thoughts. Good Luck Everyone!

I was one of the original DVMT holders that took cash and was ready to unload the shares right after the deal, but im not selling at this price. Even with Michael Dell this seems like a no brainer"
hey spark do you know what 13D filings are have you looked at them for DVMT lots of big hedge funds holding and bought shares above current price as of right now. Why arent they buggin out Dodge cox has 15 million shares of dvmt
What happened??
Does anyone know what the tax consequences or cost basis considerations will be for the conversion of DVMT (Class V) to the new DELL Stock (Class C). Is it a simple pass through? For example the cost basis for the DVMT shares that are converted are transferred to the new Class C Dell shares.
$INTC top architect resigned last month and now the chief engineer is out. what is next with $DELL?

"To keep market share, DELL need to go 90% AMD modern superior products at 7nm and 10% Intel antique inferior products with more than 100 patches?"
"Carl says: Over the last six months, a number of large DVMT stockholders contacted us to try to enlist our support in fighting Dell’s unfair and undervalued proposed buyout. After analyzing the situation, it was obvious to us that Michael Dell and Silver Lake were trying to capture an unprecedented $11 billion in value from DVMT stockholders. The situation was a “no-brainer” and we decided to get involved. In fact, with 18.5 million shares, we became Dell’s largest public stockholder. Largely due to our opposition, today Dell enhanced the deal by reducing the value being diverted from DVMT stockholders from over $11 billion to $8 billion. Although we believe a far better deal could have been obtained, unfortunately, and as you might imagine, we were not invited to the negotiations by either Dell or Goldman. In connection with the revised deal, it appears that stockholders representing 17% of the stock have decided to switch over and support Dell. As a result of this, as well as the support Dell already had, we have determined that a proxy fight would be unwinnable and have decided to withdraw our Delaware litigation and terminate our proxy contest. We want to thank all DVMT stockholders who supported us and would also like to thank the Delaware courts for acting so promptly. We believe we have greatly enhanced value for all DVMT stockholders, which includes my favorite DVMT stockholder, Icahn Enterprises (Nasdaq: IE"

Anyone buy today
"The window for determining the DVMT/DELL CLASS C exchange rate is over. According to the price dynamics of the DVMT shares , it looks like the exchange ratio will be lot closer to 1.8 shares/DVMT share. This is a positive development."
It’s a joke!
"This is pretty telling...""Intel Corp. may become the Grinch who stole Christmas from large PC makers. HP Inc. (HPQ) and Dell Technologies Inc. $DELL both admitted Tuesday that they expect a negative impact on their future results as a result of chip shortages for which Intel apologized last week. Dell laid bare that the chip giant's shortages have gotten worse, an issue that was not clear in the apology, since Intel $INTC reiterated its stronger-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter."""
does anyone know what is happening regarding merger etc - want to get out of holding this stock but need it to return to 80$ to break even ?
DELL has been advertising quite a lot on television ads and also print ads lately. Hopefully it pays off and becomes evident with strong sales revenue and improved share price.
surprise surprise
They had some interesting insights about DELL on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Dell is the epitome of corporate greed and skrewing the small shareholder. The shareholders get $80 in stock versus $120 for the hedge funds. How is that “fair”?
125 next week150 next month
Can you fall any faster? OMG! 
"Hey Michael, you are making good money if you sell when you do, but remember one thing! This is Computer stock that you bought real cheap. I would ride it out for a few years my friend and see what Dell can do. You could be making a mistake getting out so early."
Note that Dell's losses more than doubled in the 4th quarter. On another note - VMware crushed it!! moved up OVER $6 after hours.Maybe we'll see some movement in Dell's price tomorrow.......
"If Dell ""guarantees"" to buy DVMT for $109.00 p/s............why is this at $95.00 ??"
does anybody know how the options of dell and vmw will be handled after the spinoff.?
Easy green day tomorrow. AH volume only 70k. Average daily volume is 1.9 million.

"Great quarter for Dell!!! Going to rise quite a bit over the next couple months. Coming into earnings it was beat up way too much and down way too much. Dell is alive and well. On the call, they said we are in the early innings of IT investment cycle. Time to buy."

"It will be very interesting as to the value that IPO investors will ascribe to the new Dell shares. Presumably, it will be below Dell's thoughts of $77+/per share. If so, it shows that he was trying to cram down a poor deal on DVMT holders. I think it's best to hold my DVMT and wait and see. Even if I am forced out later ... it probably will be at a better price than what currently is offered. Correct ?"
"DELL should count their lucky stars they own a big chunk of VMW.@@@Tucked near the elevators on the 22nd floor of a 520-foot tower at Amazon.com Inc.’s headquarters in downtown Seattle, Anthony Liguori’s lab is a work in progress. His team moved in this summer, but during a visit last month, tables pushed up against the wall were covered in keyboards and computer accessories still in their packaging. A metal frame hanging from the ceiling awaited to route plugs and fiber connections to 10 experimental server racks that have yet to arrive. This is where Liguori’s team is putting the finishing touches on Outposts, Amazon’s big new move against the likes of IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Dell Technologies as well as cloud rival Microsoft Corp.

The tracking stock issued as part of the deal was meant to reflect VMware’s value. But the security, known by its ticker DVMT, persistently traded at a discount to VMware. That gap effectively accrued to Dell’s owners, dismaying some investors in the tracking stock. It meant investors balked at Dell’s initial offer to buy out shareholders of DVMT and forced it to sweeten the bid to get the deal done.

"why hasn't the stock reacted more favorably .... like closer to 109 ? presumably, if approved, I get $109 of ""value"" from this. sure, not everybody will be able to accept the cash option and maybe some pro-rata formula is applied. but even so, some of my shares could receive 109 cash and some 109 ""value"" of new dell stock. unless the dell stock drops immediately from 109 to 91.91 (today's after hours price), i could sell it quick and make whatever difference is left."
Does anyone who chose the option conversion have your DVMT shares with Vanguard? Are you seeing the conversion yet? In general do we have any idea how long it will take for Dell to send the information to our brokers?

Dell is pitiful today. 
"Dell Scam: Dell's so called Spin-off of VMware deal is not what mainstream thinks.Dell will distribute its 81% stake of Vmware to Dell shareholders. Problem, Michael Dell now owns 65% of Dell and because of this he is the largest shareholder of Dell. Michael Dell will end up owning over 51% of VMWare with the distribution of Vmware shares transferring to Dell shareholders. Before the deal Dell was valued at a negative -24 Billion (Liquidity Hangover with so much debt) and after the VMware deal Dell is now valued at negative -4 Billion. Dell sold it stake in its Boomi Cloud business recently for 4 Billion cash so now Dell has a clean slate in regards to tilting to positive valuation trying to get investor grade rating by continuing to capitalize off other Vmware sharholders that are or non-Dell shareholders from past history manipulations. VMWare is still Dell's piggy bank by taking on more debt. Dell doesn’t have investor grade rating so it is going to shift the debt over to VMWare so now VMware may lose its investor grade rating soon. Michael Dell historically has dipped into the piggy bank with its DVMT tracking stock nightmare for VMWare which was supposed to track VMWare value which it didn’t and allowed Vmware value to evaporate into Dell’s piggy bank again. Dell floated Pivotal and monetized its value to pay down debt to deleverage and then Michael Dell used the piggy bank of Vmware again to buy Pivotal back after it realized how important Pivotal was to Dell eco-system.VMWare stock is controlled by Dell is a major concern because of Dell’s debt hangover so this is the reason most investors will not touch Vmware’s stock. The story continues to playout to pay down Dell’s debt with a salesmen like approach that Wall Street and mainstream investors do not understand what is going on in regards to lost Vmware value to sharholders.When Dell bought VMware initially, they had a gap between the amount of cash they could raise and the amount of debt they could take on. Dell and Silver Lake and a few other investors were only able to raise 4 Billion but they supposedly got 67 billion for the over deal. The way they covered the gap was they created a tracking stock called DVMT because Dell wanted to go public again to pay down their debt. DMVT was supposed track Vmware’s value but this never worked out for Vmware shareholders in their favor. DVMT was a public company but Dell was private and wanted to go public again so they were going to do this through the DVMT deal by issuing shares of Dell by going public again. Dell then was able to go public but with a lot of debt. Dell floated pivotal and monetized that specific companies value to pay down its large debt. Then Dell went back to Vmware as the piggy bank again and said now we want to buy Pivotal back by using Vmware’s cash and issuing some Vmware shares (Dillusion of VMware stock)My take on this is Michael Dell says he is unlocking value for Vmware and Dell both with the recent deal because Vmware has benefited off Dell’s eco-system by as much as 35% growth. The problem with this thinking is if all of this value (Vmware’s Cash) continually goes back to Dell over and over again then VMWare shareholders continually lose. The next losing step for Vmware because of the piggy bank drama unfolding again is on the horizon it appears Vmware is going to lose their investor grade rating. The large debt they are taking paying down Dell’s debt it is that simple. I wish mainstream investors could understand how many times Michael Dell has dipped into Vmware as the piggy bank with so many clever excuses that mainstream doesn’t understand the finanicial impact."
"Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her overweight, or buy, rating on Dell stock after the company's earnings report.

"I would take a look at the Netap and AWS deal pertaining to storage just recently. Pure Storage ,Netap, and the Hyper-scalers are squezing out Dell EMC each year. Once Dell loses Vmware's revenue Dell will show itself as a declining low margin company, despite acquiring more of VMW cash to pay down debt. There will be no cash cow in the future to help Dell EMC out."
"Interestingly, my brokerage account (where I selected the cash option) isn't showing the drop in the price of the shares"
Horrendous
The perfect short for 2019.. look for this stock to trade down to $15 level...
Watch the AH gap up after close. This should have been green today from all the positive news.
$DELL breaking out! It's time. $INTC $MU $QCOM
Over the years I own several Dell computers still using a dell desktop with window 7. Still using dell lap top. I will not in invest in this company. I just don’t trust Michael Dell.
"Every time I think of selling I check Vmware stock and realize it has gone up another 15% and just cant get myself to sell. Even after this year long move Dell shares still look really cheap, that stake in Vmware is worth near 70 billion now and will likely keep going up over time"
@davis - explain? I see it's up to 100 anybody know why?
"Just to ensure that I'm understanding this deal. If I own 100 shares of Dell in early November....on the magic day, I will then own 100 shares of Dell, plus 44ish shares of VMX?"
"Amazing this stock doesn't get more love. Been riding this train since the 60s. Have a friend who works at Dell, tells me how great the company is run, some really bright management at the top in place. Judt a solid profitable company that's undervalued because of its mamageable debt load. Think this will hit $120 within the year."
"I owned Dell stock last time it was public and was forced to sell at a loss by Michael Dell, who continues to be a millionaire while investors lose their shirts."
well this is nice!!!!!!!!!!!! here we go boys. to 100
"So there is a lot of talk on the spinoff for Dell holders...I've read the SEC filing and read the posts on here and my question is surrounding the special dividend that says it will be paid to dell holders too...then the .44 shares of VMW upon closing. Understand the posts thinking it's a double dip, getting both the shares and the special cash dividend...but that seems too good to be true. Without public shaming can anyone shed light on this for me. TIA."
"About Dell>>> The sneaky president named Dell,,stole the company private at a nasty low price with shareholders so angry. Now he wants to relist with his added debt on the new Dell with less assets! Now you understand why this new dell is the old dell at more debt! Run away"
Is Dell offering a flat $120 or upto a max of $120.?
"Now that the deal is DONE, with Icahn pretty much walking away, why is it $15 below the offer price? IT can't all be Arb discount. I know the market thinks that the Estimated DELL stock price is over inflated. Now is the market waiting to show during the calibration window phase (From Nov 28th or so for 11 trading days, so that more of the mythical DELL shares are allocated to the DVMT buyout? What does the smart people on this board think?"
Wasn’t the tracking stock supposed to be equal to the VMW share?
"Cutting 401K matching benefits. Did not even know that was legal. Surely, the C-Suite likewise will not take any stock and options bonuses this year in their retirement accounts in a show of solidarity."
it is the time to fly.
"Question: As DELL shareholders. Will we be directly getting any of the special dividend $s that VMW is paying out? or is that only going to VMW shareholders, and of course, good ol Michael Dell / Silver Lake? If we are, do you interpret that as approx. $27 per DELL share, or per converted VMW shares you will be receiving (ie. .44 x your number of DELL shares). Thanks."
Really?
no worries we will back on track tomorrow

I just bought 40 options wish me luck
"The folks buying into DELL now are getting it on the cheap. Those of us who were DVMT holders, have the dual misfortune of (1) incurring capital gains from our low starting point, and (2) in REALITY, being still underwater due to the funny math that was used to convert DVMT into DELL. ie. $80 / sh.....and of course that $80 is nowhere close to the $120 that was the headline grabber for what the media was fed. And that $120 was woefully inadequate for a VWM tracker....ie. If you'd really like to get your blood pressure up, look at VMW's price now of $170, and that is AFTER throwing out a $9 billion divy. If you are a new DELL buyer, congrats.....but for us ex-DVMT holders, we had our pockets emptied by subversive/share-holder UN-friendly corporate governance, and we have a while to go to even 'break even' with the value we had taken out of our pockets and into the pockets of those whom DVMT had been entrusted to for their stewardship........don't forget that."
Vmware spinoff is a lock ! that alone doubles dell !
I smile everytime this stock goes down. Personal reasons. I'll tell you from the inside....it is not what it seems. Short.
still waiting for Dell to blow to 55..
75 b market cap against 110 b revenue The price shall be 200 at least Great company

They had some interesting insights about DELL on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
$DELL cuts revenue forecast due to $INTC chip shortage. That can’t be sitting well with Dell and their investors. A switch to AMD coming???
Has major support at the 59.90 mark . One it breaks soon it will be smooth sailing to 57$.
"Confucius say ""When [thow] shows itself, believe. I would look elsewhere you cannot trust majority shareholders."
Dell needs to compete.Dell needs to use more AMD chips.Dell will win with AMD.
"Take the bait on the pump and dump, and you will lose!"
What is wrong with Dell today? 
"Dell removes premium features from AMD Ryzen computers and laptops. That put Dell last in line for supplies of premium AMD chips behind Lenovo, HP, and all the others. What goes around comes round.$INTC $AMD"
So we will still get shares of VMW as long as we purchase shares of Dell before the spin off happens? Will we also receive the dividend for the Dell shares?
"I've been holding this stock for a year and it seems like it hits a ceiling at about 70 and just goes down from there. They have beat earnings expectations twice in a row, and instead of it going up on that it just goes down. Defies my understanding of how a stock should move. what's your take?"
After hours up pretty high.. hmm
I would start watching how low VMW shares go. If it continues to go lower I expect the spin-off to be impacted because VMW's investor grade rating will suffer dramatically. VMW is down quite a bit again today.
"I no longer will be purchasing any Dell products. I have been trying to buy a Dell Vostro for my company directly from them (online) for the past 6 days. I have never seen a worse ordering/inventory system and customer support service in my life. (Except maybe AT&T but at least I got the AT&T product in the end).I was just informed that my order was canceled inexplicably by Dell. I only learned this by proactively contact them AFTER my delivery date came and went and nothing arrived. I probably spent 6 hours on hold, on the phone, or on chat over the past 3 days. End result - order canceled with no explanation.I know this is a stock message board but if this is any indication of how the company operates, I'd recommend selling the stock."
"Some analysts seem to be doing their research but the market and commentators are struggling to understand this company structure and the broad market it plays in. Financially strong and getting stronger. Dell delivered an EPS beat, revenue is up in a number of multi-billion dollar markets, 7% in storage, 5% in Client Solutions, 11% in VMWare. Aggressive pay down of debt, near 18 billion paid down to date, whilst still managing 500million+ in income in Q3. And gaining market share in an evolving IT,storage,cloud, etc market predicted independantly to grow 5% CAGR. Whats not to like."
"Guys, it's not about how well DVMT has done....it's not about a premium over DVMT's depressed stock price....it's about DVMT having been issued as a tracker for VMW so that DVMT holders could benefit from VMW's performance and future. The delta between VMW's share price and DFVMT's share price needs to go to DVMT holders (ie. us), and not be easy money for the inside entities to arbitrage from us. That is not what entities with a fiduciary duty to minority stockholders should be advocating. I'm voting 'No'."
"So - when exactly does the new Dell stock start trading? I had shares of DVMT through E-Trade. I elected to take cash. That position is frozen in my portfolio now. I don't have access to the cash nor any shares of Dell stock. I called E-Trade and they say it hasn't been delivered to them yet - so they can't give it to me. I see a new ""DELL"" stock listed at 44.60 now on Yahoo, but no activity yet."
"M Dell is the ultimate stock market grifter After listening to how it was impossible to manage Dell on a quarter to quarter basis, he cheats Dell shareholders by taking the company private and now here we are a few years latter and he is talking about going public again. Al benefits to himself. Incredible!"
VMware spinoff should be completed in November!
