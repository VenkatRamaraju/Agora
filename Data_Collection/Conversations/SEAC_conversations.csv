351 million shares today! New 52 week high tomorrow!
contract details ?
it seems to me that the video streaming business is going against YouTube which is free for most users. Company needs to explain the differentiation to the investors. A little advantage here or there and disadvantages here and there may not be enough for platform to succeed.
Nice of them to wait until 8:00

Not good when a quarterly earnings report title line and bullet points talk about every topic imaginable except sales and earnings. LMAO I thought this was a biotech stock when I read the first page of ER.
"A few things about SEAC needs clarification:1) Their fiscal year ends in Jan. Thus, ""FY 2020"" ends next month. This is unconventional and can cause confusion as when people look up the eps estimate they may think it will only make 0.15 ""next year"". 0.15 is for this FY year ending Jan. 2020!2) I looked up Barron's for earnings estimate: the low is from Lake Street who just changed their estimate for the next yr. from 010 to 0.33, and upgraded the stock from hold to buy with a target price of 4.50. The 4Q this yr. from 0.07 to 0.18. Thus, next q ending Jan. 2020 the avg. eps is 0.185; next year ending Jan. 2021 eps is 0.40. This is a huge upward revision of eps!"

I am betting this contract is with comcast...just saying.
"There you go, right on script. Let is rise above 1.00 every so often, to keep hopes of bagholders alive so they will continue to hold existing position, maybe buy more, bring in those on the fence that have a bad case of FOMO (LOL), and of course juice the call premium to keep a bid for you to sell into. Just like clockwork, rinse and repeat. A proverbial pulse machine while the bagholders stare at the screen in amazement hanging on every penny of movement. LMAO"
Why do the $2.50 call options continue to increase?
Inverted hammer friday with decent volume. Should test a buck this week
see you in the morning

@WISECLOWNwith his weak arguments and dated letters.....
Last chance to buy the dips at opening. Gonna add some more.
I told You 2$ very soon!
Sold half this morning at $1.30Probably should have sold it all?
"There is a huge July 7.5 call buyer and I have been watching him all day: he is still bidding at 0.20, 2292 contracts, which is 220,000 shares. The 7.5 call traded 4,410 contracts, representing more than 440,000 shares. He thinks seac will trade much higher than 7.5 by July. I think a buyout is coming before July, based on this option activity and the fact that the company sold its headquarters and lease back for ONLY 6 months. I think this buyer is thinking the same way. I have been adding to my shares. I am expecting >10 by July via a buyout!"
GOOD MORNING SEAC FAMILY!!! 
"Wow TWO great days in a row for SEAC. Not sure why the sudden buying volume after we were languishing for weeks, but will take it! If we can make it three in a row tomorrow, might challenge that 52-week high of $4.56."
"Anything over 30 million in revenue will b great, and margins near 8% and $5.50 should come fast. Of course it’s guidance that’s the big variable"
The fact that this is hanging around $1.40 range is a good sign. They try to run it up various times to force last minute holders out. Next week should be a good week.
"Assuming that big deal,Verizon similar., was in the $6 to $8 MILLIONS per year., ($18 M-$24 M total amount) for next three years............from next monday morning,I am allowed to write that we are pretty close to BREAKEVEN from operations. That guess of the amount ,comes from reading when they had a BIG guy in USA in past years.3 and 4 years ago.BTW,low end asumption by me. When they were making $20 MILLIONS revenues per QTR against $5 MILL now. $34 MILLIONS in CASH FREE,to persue projected growth,assuming they won""t NEVER will need to raise more capital.99% sure. Cable companies around the world ,will be FORCE to use our services. Hundreds of small ones as in my place will need us to boost revenues,the cherry on top ......"
"Why does SEAC has 3 quarters worth of revenue in unbilled receivables? This is an alarm bell for me, maybe the sales they are recognizing in earning reports are of a type that if they billed the customer for the customer would laugh them out of the door?, why would you not bill your receivable, can anyone with knowledge explain?"
Did they halt the stock for the big news?
If the contract was T-mobile or Verizon then how much does everyone believe this stock would be worth.?
"SeaChange is said to have hosted a conference call discussing their financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. This could be their another achievement! Awesome!

Not a lot of volume on this news which is fine. Probably won’t see this on an earnings report until December. In my opinion one more deal like this could push the company into cash flow positive territory. At which point they will be ready to sell.
"Not to forget SEAC went from 1.25 to 4$ in one year that’s 325%. And so far it kept it and we’re still in uptrend. Just need patience with all the forecasts on our side so far. Revenu is increasing, debt is less and cash flow is better. If it increase half of this in 2020 I’m a very happy man."
Come on Seac!!! Show us something good either Monday or Tuesday morning...

This is a pattern with stocks they make an offering the price goes down but not always I've seen prices go up to but usually down and then back up!!!
AFTER HOURS HOLDING $1.60’s STRONG 
We should climb up to 1.85 today. JMHO
Ed has some explaining to do. There is a serious disconnect between the last earnings call and this pre-release. Are we to believe current revenue bookings and new deals were simply pushed into the 3rd quarter? There was no mention of an adjustment to full year revenue guidance and that's a problem. Difficult to trust these guys at this point.
Investors in Europe recommend SEA!! Price to reach to the end of August 2$ !
"Insider buy, 100,000 shares on 4-19"
Next stop $5.50 area. Overall the chart looks like will breach $10 on a good report in April . Wouldn’t be surprised to see $15. The optimism will be based on only slightly better than expected beat on revenue. Seems margins will also b a potential upside surprise. Then it would seem new management will definitely be trusted and guidance for fiscal 2021 may be taken as conservative estimates and a $500 million cap will be justified. Translation = $12 area
"Just listened to the webcast at Needham. They iterated the guidance of 70 to 80 m for the year or 22 to 32m for q4 which ends in 2 weeks. Mentioned a couple of times that the medium guidance is 27m. I feel they will be able to beat the street estimate which is set around 23m. The cfo also said a few time the company is undervalued at less than 2 times revenue and it normally trades at 4x. In other words, he thinks the stock should double."
Is this going to recover???
It’s 5:55 eat and some 100k shares have already traded pre market and last was $1.40. Something up
if the contract is not in process they will get the lawsuit from investors they can not lie about it zero debt is a plus for the seac i believe it will go up
in my opinion the drop under 3$ opens up a good buying opportunity. Their report states that some projects have been pushed past the 4th qtr which results in a lower revenue so that means the future rev will be amplified.
I understand we have a new CEO.........How he could have sold those shares by then?...aah Bella.....???
bullish 6
Looks like tomorrow 2/10 is going to be a good day. I could be wrong but this will b over $2 soon
"$SEAC- This stock in this period last year was already @ 5 $, multi million $ contract now, doesnt matter of offering in future period, this will go @10 $ for sure within 1-2 months max. So its already a dip, yesterday AH 2.7 now 1.9, it cant go much lower, its a 1-2 $ stock now with great future. holdin' long 6000 shares average 1.7$, plan to add more. small public float, price can easily go 5x -10× higher in short period. For example, AMC shares are in January worth few $ , i was bought 5000 shares at 2.90, 1 week.after it was already @ 20 $. Dont listen this shorts, buy and hold"
This baby wants to go!!!!
"I'm sure that with that President they will open new era, some coop is more then welcome"
"They had a great year no doubt, and there adding more options to a great product, have to love software as margins r fantastic. Framework had not hit the market till June 2019. I like the question on the call that asked how many existing customers, 120 , how many have made the framework upgrade , zero. So all new clients and a solid base of facts to show those other 120 they already have done business with, ( some do have a bad taste in there mouth from previous management) and many left them , competitors were selling for next to nothing, but not a one stop product like framework. Yossi said 2-3 years last year and even though I did throw some smack at them yesterday for having missed guidance, they r doing a great job. He also keeps feeling some big deals coming, and the backlog of 23 million is high as ever before. It’s just when u miss a mark wall st makes u pay. Traders only remember making money on the short side and love when a company has that reputation. Seemed they were ready to loose that reputation until yesterday. $2.62 held. 200mda on the weekly"

1.25 and sky!
Its gonna be a boring ride until there is new news...
when new SEAC president buy shares?? that would be a trigger to rise for 3$

great work lads- reversal will continue momentum into this coming week- we make our own luck
"@WISELAMAI'm going to take a guess here:SEAC was hurting....there's no doubt about that. They entered into an agreement to ""shelf"" shares for a raining day. As they were doing this, a company came to them and said we want to use their platform. With the ""share dilution"" the company planned to use for extra cash, it would be a double win for them. I don't see how there is anything cooked about this but just timing for SEAC."
Lot of bag holders here

"BTW....the platform as an intangible an depreciated,and producing ,from last IV QTR,2021.............$5 MILLIONS,the value was write -off,due to the current small stream of revenues.NOTHING to worry. We at $1 PPS.,aprox,we are trading at cash ,thou the rest and the future ,is FREE for us.............no value at this $1 PPS. This is a FACT...........based on my rough numbers......!!!"
"Still to much shorties ... Guys, what you think for today AH ?"
where is this news?
i want know contract. why they didnt announce about contract??
"Almost 50% of the shares are owned by insiders and institutions.. and the float was already low.. so with that 1.85$ offering, 30% drop, this should go way back up in no time..!"
"An exciting ""story"" but incredibly vague and unspecific. Definite improvement, however. Some big insider buys would help me believe in a $3 to $5 intermediate target. Hard to blame those that have a ""wait and see"" attitude, but patience is wearing thin."

"today we have 48.14 MILLIONS outstanding sh.....still not much,if they exercise their over allotment at $1.85,will go 49.68 MILL,still not much. We should be trading in the $2 area and close at $2.20 on our way to $3 PPS;to reach at least the $150 MILLIONS which has been invested in platform., no one has.EXCELLENT CC.Buen dia to all."
.....$1.05 to SKY
Company ownership changed hands in after hours alone. Headed higher.
So there is a new CEO on the heels of an SEC revenue recognition investigation...That would lead one to conclude that there are in fact revenue recognition issues and financial statement may need to be re-filed and revised downward...
"""IF"" their product is really good....shareholders should be safe... and if they asked government for money to reimburse salaries because of COVID, then something like this would be expected. That would mean the impact on revenues is big...but costs might be partially offset by kurzarbeit policy... and if product is demanded, the SEAC should recover soon...maybe next quarter. On good news it may jump back over $3.00...interesting stock to watch now"

Buy Buy or just hold and shut up dont sell repeat dont sell. After hour and pre market tomorrow will be special. definitely $5 and over.
"If an, yet, unknown investor is willing to pay 1,85 dollar pr share compared to the current price then they have been informed about something the rest of us has not. I´m pretty sure nobody would make such an investment based of their DD without knowing the full details of the recent muliti million dollar deal and finacial information that´s about to be presented the coming week. I´m not saying this could´t go down but based on the offering and the fact that investors where willing to pay what they did does make me believe that good news are on their way."
"I’ve been in and out of this one for a while. In my opinion the company is primed to sell in the next 6-24 months. We will see low volume, little published media, and a steady move towards profitability. The share price will probably remain stable but may decline slightly. I may keep buying as much as I can for $1 or less and trim at $1.20 between now and then. But in my opinion that is the next major catalyst."
we might see $2+ today

The offering was $1.85 so why is this going down after going up 20% yesterday and now down 15% today not a good indication of sentiment!!!
Shorted shares 22% of low float. Let’s get that number over 40% and volume to a trickle at where it was before March in the 300k range. 10m short shares for a quick cover and this stock could catch fire.

Make your own decision.At .50-.75 BK could be priced in, but I think the process of pricing that possibility hascertainly begun, thus the move from 1.50 to 1.00. Simply don't think they can competewith the big boys in this space like Fastly, etc."
today SEAC is starting new Age better one!
"My hunch................one of these days the company will announce another BIG deal as the one already in USA..........maybe a BIG guy in Europe. Thou to $3 in a heart beat................wait and learn.., in CC they spoke of a deal in Mexico with Tele Cable.........and the CEO mentioned they will announce new deals."
"""announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 10,323,484 shares of common stock of the Company, at a price of $1.85 per share for total gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $19.1 million.""How is this trading under the offering price?"
-No debt and positive liquidity situation-EPS up 30% Y/Y-Potential with AWS to have a strong Q2
"WE have over $22 MILLIONS CASH and only total DEBT of $2.41 MILL(incuding current maturities).................allow me to say we have an ideal situation,with the BIG deal (Comcast,et al),allows me to think we are close to BREAKEVEN........... With plenty of CASH,$22 MILLIONS divided by 48 .14MIL. new OUTSTANDING share count----$0.45 cash per full diluted shares. Plus we own a platform that has cost $150 MILLIONS........!!!!.........plus 150 software guys in POLAND. We must trade at least at $3 per sh......to match the $150 MIL invested.,in platform."
"sure, it will be 3 tomorrow"
"Shorts are TOAST,very low volume at the close.....!!!......in final 15 minutes,means no one is selling.They are exchanging shares between them........as simple as that.,. a FACT. Common guys aren""t jumping in as well., at final minutes."
when some big Investor will take rest of Free Float? 2$ schould be ASAP
"Very active premarket, 300k shares traded. The good thing it’s up about 6%"
"Amazon deal ( I don’t know the details of the deal) should put any framework thoughts of being inferior product aside. Seems it may be setting thoughts of the recent sell off was overblown, volume is picked up. As I already stated, pps was kept under $2 intentionally to get margin shares. Seems logical. Or we got news come Thursday cc"
Nice follow through from the last earnings call and good PR. Looking forward to the call.

"RESUME........collecting those $9 MILLIONS of UNBILLED for this year,means $ 9333 per month per actual customers ,thou $746000 per month of UNBILLED...........and losing $1.130 000 per month,with new Verizon similar deal on $8 M per year.........or $666 000 per month,we are now $300000 per month in green,above BREAKEVEN operations. ONE or two BIG deals more,and to the moon we go....."
"Volume slowed, but that big seller is still there, selling big blocks. Have to wait till he finishes. Range bound for now, but I expect a pop at the time of Needham conference if the company is consistent with what it said during last q's conference call."
"You should be very concerned about Julian singer, Robert Pons and Karen Singers involvement with this company. They will try to sell this companies assets and then do a reverse split and delist this company if they are able to get a controlling interest in it. They just did this with CCUR Holding Ticker CCUR. They took control of the company, sold the assests for $70M, then have now announced they are going to do a reverse split of 3000 to 1, anyone with less than 3000 shares will be cashed out at a $24M valuation. This is not the first time, they also did this with Live Microsystems. My advise if you want this company to turn around and grow is get the Singers away from it, call your board and tell them to take action now."
I just bought 500 shares?? Should I buy more at it looks ready to take off again??!!! Any idea how high?? $5??
"Actually, VOD market is so much competitive. How this company can succeed??"

I am a bit underwater....................but shorts are WAY ,WAY under and losing their shirt,with a simple news of a BIG deal., maybe Europe. HOLD ,cause nothing to lose and much to gain."
Still no comment from SEAC on the SEC revenue recognition investigation or the multiple delist letters from the NASDAQ...
Heavy call option contracts opened today for this month strike prices $2.50 and decent volume for a $5 strike. Very odd for 10 days away. Some sort of news coming Thursday
They need to release more information - Common Man ! As sleepy Joe would say ...

"For what it’s worth, the weekly chart has a massive 2 year perfect cup andHandle formation, oneMore month to add, then we will never see $4 again"
"Someone who actually knows this company, can you explain how both product and service revenue decline so quickly? Is it a one time hit due to covid so therefore the revenue will be recoverable ? I just don’t understand what happened over the past twelve months. They still have employees, they still go to work, they still have customers, they have talented employees from what it looks like, it’s not like they were in the hospitality industry, so again how does their revenue during covid fall that much and would it naturally bounce back in the vaccine era."
"""Total revenue decreased 19% to $6.9 million from $8.5 million in the same period last year. Product revenue increased 163% to $3.1 million (or 45% of total revenue) from $1.2 million (or 14% of revenue) in the same period last year. Service revenue decreased 48% to $3.8 million (or 55% of total revenue) from $7.3 million (or 86% of total revenue) in the same period last year.Revenue backlog at quarter end increased 97% to $21.7 million from $11.0 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020.Gross profit decreased by 14% to $2.5 million (or 36% of total revenue) from $2.9 million (or 34% of total revenue) in the same period last year.Total operating expenses decreased by 24% to $8.8 million from $11.6 million in the same period last year.GAAP loss from operations totaled $6.3 million, an improvement from a loss of $8.7 million in the same period last year.Non-GAAP loss from operations totaled $5.2 million, or $(0.14) per basic share, an improvement from a loss of $7.5 million, or $(0.20) per basic share, in the same period last year.GAAP net loss totaled $6.5 million, or $(0.17) per basic share, an improvement from a loss of $10.8 million, or $(0.30) per basic share, in the same period last year.Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $9.8 million at quarter-end. Also, the Company had no debt at quarter-end. Management currently believes the Company's liquidity position coupled with the recent cost-reduction measures enable the company to execute its growth strategy."""
"Offering is closed as we speak. Demand is very high, This will close in green."
The 10 million share offering would bring the market cap to 70million based on today’s close its 58 million. Still very very cheap and they will have 20milion more cash. Need money to make money
10$ TARGET
"Thinking this may be quickly starting back up to $1.85 based on the recent offering at that price, andinsider buying."
CEO keeps buying shares... something is cooking and about to explode!
"This is done consolidating, big buys r trying to shake us retail out, going to b a good ride. Volume has never been like this, ever. And the 10 million shares was already bought for higher than market price. I wish the pole and pullback looked better. The offering can b an excuse"

"Harry...the 8k is basically saying its hard to get around right now and they might have delays. it's not a BK or a zillion shares of dilution. Their debt was virtually nonexistent and in fact was stated as ""zero cents per share "" of debt. I have larger investments in a few other companies but I'm sticking with seac."

"Being that SEAC is so unpredictable as far as revenue goes, most stocks where up today, because common sense says the last 2 q’s of the year will b good. Market doesn’t know what SEAC will do, constantly inconsistent"
"IN rough numbers with the cash of $22 MILLIONS plus the new Comcasts deal,plus the $15 MILLIONS of UNBILLED receivables.,WE MUST BE TRADINDG at $1 today ,below CASH WORKING CAPITAL..........just amazing. They close ,Netherlands and Ireland centers,last year,with almost a 54 % reduction on OPERATING EXPENSES......................just a small increase in revenues will make us BREAKEVEN...........................with $22M plus $15 M of receivables to be in business and turnaround the ship ,under present scenario for more than THREE years to FOUR years ,without the need to raise one more cent,but expecting a huge INCRESE of revenues with coming new clients."

"Any theories as to what we are going to see/hear tomorrow after the close? Personally, I think we have about a 33% chance of each of the following:1. Lot of talk - no real progress or results [ - ]2. Off and running, with decent short term progress and increasing pipeline [ = ]3. Firing on all cylinders with impressive short term results and a large, monetized pipeline [ + ]"
Nice!! Glad I didn’t listen to the person on here who told me not buy this today.! Wrong! Lol
"NO DEBTS basiclly.........meager $2.41 MILLIONS ,with OVER $22 MILLLIONS cash,with just announced GREAT deal with the COMCASTS et al., we must be pretty close to BREAKEVEN in operations.

One more BIG deal ,maybe from Europe ,will send us plus $1.85,allowing me to still hold,but inly much happy than today,cause it has been a shaky ride,up o date. 10-K;file on time and as they said in CC,is a great relief for me. Nothing about the SEC,letter ,still not relevant unbilled collectables.,are showing,with no significance at all."
2$ to the end of September 
"Thank you Gullermo and IDK, also wiselama. At least you guys keep the conversation alive! I think if we hold long we will be fine ;)"
Earnings weren't that important! We still have alot of companies who are going to work with SeaChange only this hasn't been comfirmed nor has it been disclosed wich companies they're talking about.
"ok, today sell off...and tomorrow what? More customers, higher winning ratio, higher margin, more revenues, more customers, unique product wiping out competition... so..tomorrow what? :-)"

Company has received those funds............Has ONLY $2.41 MILLIONS of TOTAL DEBT.........and with new deal with COMCASTS et al,we must be pretty close to BREAKEVEN in operations. A few more deals down the road........and going back to PRE pandemic,will send easy over $3.Buen dia."

green after hours...weird
"POLL: Guys, FYI my trade data service is now flashing a strong technical “Buy Signal” for $seac, both short-term and long-term!! Do you think it is a worthy investment at the current PPS? Press  for Yes        , press  for No. Thanks in advance for your poll participation, and please feel free to give your best reasoning for your vote.   SNORT!!!!         "
"People that said it will hit $3, $5, and some even said $16. Where you at?"
People's the Real date for Earnings report is the 4/13 so dont believe these bashers just buy or hold have patience this will takeoff.
when SEAC will stand up from knees????
"Quarter ends today, news may have leaked of a good q"
"These guys to breakeven in this short attack,they must send us ,still way lower and expect capitulation by some ,to sell them cheap., with a HUGE VOLUME............... WON""T happen,based in the $1.20 level and LOW volume,considering their computer free trades.Nothing new to watch them. I will double down below $1.........so will wait.if they can make me happy.,happy."
after hour will be huge tomorrow is the day. $$
Latest filing on Vanguard.......I take it that Vanguard's various funds want to accumulate more than 5% of the company total? From what I understand it appears the company is allowing it as long as no individual fund (in the whole umbrella of Vanguard) will own more than 5% itself. Currently the total Vanguard group owns about 1.51M shares (as of 9/30. Next update on Nasdaq will be before Feb 15th). I'd think they'd need to as it appears SEAC will make the Russell 2000 reindexing this year.
What predictions everyone's thinking this coming week will be.?
sorry dudes.. whats mean 'AH'?? I'm korean. so i can speak english a little.. please let me know.
@WISELAMALooking at all the SEC filings......why would employees exercise buying stock options at the $1.60 range knowing they were going to tank their own stock a couple months later?
These guys can work form home office and their product will be in demand when people stay home...perfect coronavirus stock imo

SEAC presenting at the Needham conference in a couple weeks. The added exposure can't hurt. SEAC is a software company in the midst of a major turnaround. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings improved to .14/share vs. a loss last year. And sounds like Q4 will be even stronger. Yet SEAC continues to languish around $4 despite some exciting upside potential in a stock market that's been on fire lately. I'll keep accumulating ahead of that Q4 report.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seachange-international-participate-22nd-annual-134500740.html
When are they reporting earnings ?
"Maybe , I do know now ,who ,with his proclaimed group of millionaires is shorting this baby......!!!...........GUYS load as much as possible,take advantage of these BIG BOYS fooling weak hands.They have more patince that a lot of daytraders,so they count on that.........and if not is naked short selling,the company must be aware now.Hold tight and load."
"Filled the gap, quite normal action.Biz looks good: new product taking off. Video on demand is huge: check your cox cable: you can watch movies and tv shows any time you like when you missed an episode. Verizon is coming back as a customer. Read the earnings call transcript. The high estimate for the coming year is eps 0.47, low 0.33, avg. 0.40. Thus trading at less than 10 pe. The stock should go up to min 6.00 if use a market multiple of 15. The biz is clearly turning around."
2$ soon watch 
Yesterday after hour SEAC was $2.79 don’t panic. They are going to announce the Deal Worth and Multi-Million Dollar Broadband Provider shortly. Hold and buy more ride the wave. 
This stock will rise relatively quickly to $200M market cap where it belongs now...and then it will keep on rising slowly...but steadily. Maybe somebody else will come with better software platform than Framework...but not sooner than in 3-5 years... till then they will push the company´s stock to double digits.
"Today was a tough day to hold, but prefer to see it as a discount!"
which company dealt with ?? i wonder it. why they haven't announced yet?? i'm confused
HOLD ........nothing to lose and MUCH to gain....Not selling one share below $1.85.
Tomorrow going to 3$ watch and see news coming tomorrow
High volume on the august $2 call options yesterday
"Once the contract details are revealed, this will be much higher (atleast $5.00 )."
It was up to over 2.7 premarket. People being scared when it goes down 25 cent amazes me. Itll bounce back
good start
Why isn?t there any specifics as to 1: How much the Multi Million Contract is worth and 2: Who the provider is ? I?m invested but frustrated as to the lack of transparency #$%$ starting to regret it man . Give the shareholders some information.
lama is digging for his grave. R.I.P
