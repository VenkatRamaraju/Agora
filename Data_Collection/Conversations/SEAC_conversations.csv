From yesterday's yahoo! article in the Safe Harbor Disclosure :...the expected growth of the OTT market; the outcome of the Company’s active discussions with approximately 50 content owners; the Company’s aggregate potential revenue over the next THREE years as a result of its contract WIN with one of the LARGEST mobile network providers...
SEAC presenting at the Needham conference in a couple weeks. The added exposure can't hurt. SEAC is a software company in the midst of a major turnaround. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings improved to .14/share vs. a loss last year. And sounds like Q4 will be even stronger. Yet SEAC continues to languish around $4 despite some exciting upside potential in a stock market that's been on fire lately. I'll keep accumulating ahead of that Q4 report.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seachange-international-participate-22nd-annual-134500740.html

"Litlle understanding of SEAC has caused the market to make this nice mistake, which gives excellent opportunity to buy cheap great company with great product and make money :-)"

"Earnings are tomorrow 4/13 @ 5PM ET. Lots of interest early this morning, options volume for $2.50 has picked up with a lot of interest in at $5.....No risk-it no biscuit, today is the day to make a move on this stock"

"""announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 10,323,484 shares of common stock of the Company, at a price of $1.85 per share for total gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $19.1 million.""How is this trading under the offering price?"
when SEAC will stand up from knees????
Multimillion contract... this will hit $2 in a short time.
"we don't know the full extent of competition ie, what is the diference between SEAC's offering and Anyclip, YouTube and others."
it seems to me that the video streaming business is going against YouTube which is free for most users. Company needs to explain the differentiation to the investors. A little advantage here or there and disadvantages here and there may not be enough for platform to succeed.
"Thinking this may be quickly starting back up to $1.85 based on the recent offering at that price, andinsider buying."
if Mr. Aquino belive that future belongs to SEAC he needs to buy shares! waiting for his move

"There is a huge July 7.5 call buyer and I have been watching him all day: he is still bidding at 0.20, 2292 contracts, which is 220,000 shares. The 7.5 call traded 4,410 contracts, representing more than 440,000 shares. He thinks seac will trade much higher than 7.5 by July. I think a buyout is coming before July, based on this option activity and the fact that the company sold its headquarters and lease back for ONLY 6 months. I think this buyer is thinking the same way. I have been adding to my shares. I am expecting >10 by July via a buyout!"
-No debt and positive liquidity situation-EPS up 30% Y/Y-Potential with AWS to have a strong Q2
@WISELAMALooking at all the SEC filings......why would employees exercise buying stock options at the $1.60 range knowing they were going to tank their own stock a couple months later?

"Almost 50% of the shares are owned by insiders and institutions.. and the float was already low.. so with that 1.85$ offering, 30% drop, this should go way back up in no time..!"

"Comcast execs continue to drop hints that they might extend the reach of Flex, their free streaming/smart home platform for broadband-only customers, outside the cable operator's traditional service footprint.""Right now, it's working great within footprint, but we're building out plans beyond that,"" Dave Watson, CEO of Comcast Cable, said on today's Q4 2020 earnings call when asked about the out-of-foot potential for Flex."
Did they halt the stock for the big news?
Time for Rocket is comming 
"I’ve been in and out of this one for a while. In my opinion the company is primed to sell in the next 6-24 months. We will see low volume, little published media, and a steady move towards profitability. The share price will probably remain stable but may decline slightly. I may keep buying as much as I can for $1 or less and trim at $1.20 between now and then. But in my opinion that is the next major catalyst."
why they don't wont to free the price? 2$ may be very easy
when new SEAC president buy shares?? that would be a trigger to rise for 3$
Wouldn't shareholders receive over a $1 a share if they just liquidated the business?
"If an, yet, unknown investor is willing to pay 1,85 dollar pr share compared to the current price then they have been informed about something the rest of us has not. I´m pretty sure nobody would make such an investment based of their DD without knowing the full details of the recent muliti million dollar deal and finacial information that´s about to be presented the coming week. I´m not saying this could´t go down but based on the offering and the fact that investors where willing to pay what they did does make me believe that good news are on their way."
