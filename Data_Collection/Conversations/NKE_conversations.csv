$160 tomorrow????????
looks like a jackpot surprise tomorrow! It doesn't matter how much I could have made - I wouldn't buy a pair of sox from the company!
"This is great!When China takes over the world and turns it into a ginormous concentration camp, NKE share price will soar to $10,000!"
Remember to buy your shoes on Friday. New orders always come in on Friday's . You don't want to buy shoes that have been there 24 hours or longer.
You guys still have time to get out and take profits :)
NKE is the only stock you need to own.
added this morning too. Nice!!!
"Somebody once said ... ""I look at a 1yr chart, a 5yr chart, a 10yr chart, a 20yr chart and I think to myself ... what a wonderful investment. No wonder life is so good.However, to be fair, the ""never Nike"" faux-patriot racist tumptards deserve a lot of credit for helping to drive NKE from $50 to $161 ($166.53) with their (highly successful LMAO) boycott."""
Creeping to $170 next week
"China & US politic are getting worse. All Chinese stocks are down. NKE stock will be effective due to big market in China, time to buy PUTS!"
The market has been down but NKE will rise to $140 again this week. Really hoping to see $200 by Christmas.
Close below $145. Like I said.
NKE is extremely overbought right. Big price drop coming!!
"so free cash flow return to 2019 levels, yet now the stock is valued at 55% more since then? LOL so in the past 5 years Nike averaged less than 10% growth rate yet its priced at 40x FCF. I wonder where these analysts get their education to have a buy rating."
Broke 52 week high...this thing is runningggg tomorrow!!!
"NKE is turning into the Bitcoin of sneakers and both will soon suffer the same very bad fate.Woke tulips, anyone?"
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"A 200 dollar stock or a 500 dollar stock who knows, don't miss out!"
"With both stocks selling for the same price, AXP is the winner in this horse race. You can check out today's price action. There will be some rotation out of NKE which has already had a nice run, into stocks with more potential upside."
"The fact that today, August 10, NKE is one of only a handful of DJIA stocks trading down as the overall all markets are making new ATH's, tells me NKE is getting tired. The fabulous run that it's had may be taking a breather. I'm not a chartist, but some would argue that it needs to go down and fill the giant gap created back in June before another leg up."
At 75x what they earn for their CHEAP Chinese made gym shoes BWAAAHAHAHAahahahahah NIKE CRP
For the past 2 weeks there has been nearly 50 people constantly lined up outside the local Nike store. Should have bought in when I noticed it lol
Is this price sustainable?
How would you feel tomorrow knowing that you could have sold your NKE stake today at a decent profits?
"Nike would very much like to keep its slave labor, thank you.https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/nike-would-very-much-like-to-keep-its-slave-labor-thank-you/ar-BB1bvibD"
"EquityStatsDotCom07:25 PMBest 5-day returns in S&P 500 for week ending 6/25/2021: 1. Nike $NKE (20.2%), 2. Occidental Petroleum $OXY (17.58%), 3. L Brands $LB (15.12%), 4. CarMax $KMX (12.58%), 5. Marathon Oil $MRO (11.93%). Average 5-day return to all stocks in the index was 3.38% #WeeklyBest"
My best holding so far !!! Hold forever
I can't take it anymore. This stocks is green every day. Does this stock ever stop growing?
Insiders are selling like wildfire. Get ready shorts!
$165 here we come.
Nike is undervalued stock . Should go $200 . Only concern is sales in China . And the boycott that happened . Will be interesting quarter .
Nike shoes wear out fast when you stand for the pledge of allegiance.
Way over priced
Must have found a new supply of slave labor to build their cheap shoes.
I opened a short position at the end. Ready to add more and double down.Very overbought.
Back to $120 NKE is overvalued
The poster #$%$ certainly chose an ?apropo? username.
buy PUT(s)to make a lot of $$$ today.Institutions trying to hold up the stock but not for long. Do it before Chinese are dumping NKE
"Imagine how much it would have grown if the tea billies weren't boycotting it, LOLThe footwear giant reported record sales in North America for its fourth fiscal quarter. Sales surged 141% from last year, and 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 (aka pre-pandemic). Digital sales soared 147% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Even China sales — where Nike has been swept up into consumer protests over its stance on Xinjiang — increased in all product categories in the quarter (led by a 34% increase in equipment sales). Jordan brand sales rose an impressive 31% to $5 billion in Nike's just completed fiscal year."
"Nice look, per ET: ‘Nike Is a Brand That Is of China and for China’ Says the Company’s CEO““We’ve always taken a long term view. We’ve been in China for over 40 years,” Donahoe said, expressing his optimism that the brand will continue to grow quickly in the world’s most populous nation.Referring to the apparel brand’s co-founder and ex-CEO, he said: “Phil [Knight] invested significant time and energy in China in the early days and today we’re the largest sport brand there.”Nike was recently criticized by a U.S. senator for turning a blind eye to allegations of forced labor in China, arguing they are making American consumers complicit in Beijing’s repressive policies.Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on China’s repression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in its western Xinjiang region, Republican Senator Marco Rubio said many U.S. companies had not woken up to the fact that they were “profiting” from the Chinese government’s abuses.”"
"Love to see this so called ""woke"" company in the red."
It’s time to split the Nike stock 3 to 1.
Zee please tell us why you think Bidumb the kid sniffer is such a good president!!!?? Please. I bet you will ignore an adult conversation like usual.
$120 a week or two
earnings show where all the stimulus checks money is going. clothes. wait till people have to actually start working for a salary again if it ever happens. doubting hotsy totsy clothes will be at the top of the list.
Any less than $200 is a joke. Should get there by Halloween.
Boycott Nike
NKE will jump up 5-7 points next week.
Panty told me to sell at $129.
"NKE does appear slightly overvalued at the moment, but you can't help but admire the the 77% gain in over the past year. Since it's a great momentum stock, I certainly wouldn't be betting against it."
Get ready SHORTS. Nike is on it's way down!!!
"The only thing our two political parties can agree on is that the CCP is committing genocide, something this company cant even fathom to realize. I think the china party is over, enjoy the top..."
"I expect NKE to drift lower this week, but still trade over $165."
Invest 10k into this stock?
"Green days for notes coming. NKE is just too powerful, watch."
NKE revenue will be hampered by Tokyo Olympics restrictions. Japan says Olympics with no fans still possible as COVID cases keep skyrocketing in Japan.
"I expect NKE to fade towards the end of the day. It's had a nice run, including that nice $20 gap up back in June. I'm rolling out some 167.5 calls today to pick up a few extra bucks. If I get called at that price sometime, I'm not going to complain, it's been a nice ride, but I think there are some better values out there at the moment."
"As usual, get woke go broke."
"The sky is not the limit, we can go a lot higher with NKE, because sports is back, all upside potential, do not leave to get on the bus to late, or you might not get on in time, and you miss out on an opportunity!"

"By the way some of the NKE investors in here like BA are a disgrace. Keep the politics out of it. You have nothing to be proud of with this current administration. NKE is a solid investment, but for all of the wrong reasons. NKE will be $200 sooner than you think."
"Let the profit taking begin, good thing it is relatively an expensive stock"

"Wow, just wow Nike! You are simply an amazing stock!"
"Got the kick lower this morning I was expecting in NKE, now it should stabilize around this level."
I heard about NKE the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
15 firms give or take boosted price targets. reminds me of peloton back in february after they released earnings.
"IF joebama starts handing out reparations, im buying stock in $NKE immediately. maybe even 100%, all in. anyone recommend and publicly traded companies that sell gold chains?"

Nike is currently on track to beat their 1 year estimate of 178. Wouldn't be surprised if it cracked above 180. It's been exponentially growing over 35 years and it shows no patterns of slowing down anytime soon

Your chance today to do a buy/write on NKE for September 3 expiration on either 162.5 or 165 strike price. Own the stock on the August 27 X date and collect the $1.10 dividend and get assigned on September 3 and collect the $1.00 premium. Not bad for eight business day's work.

"Yeah, this makes sense."
Nike to $175!
"I know I have been warned, but exactly what is the timing of this? I've been warned since 2017 when NKE was $50 and Colin Kaepernick had the audacity to quietly and peacefully knell in protest of inequity. Is NKE headed all the way back to $150 or will fundamentals keep the stock higher than that. Since value investors overrule biased feeling, inquiring minds want to know. LOL..."
$200 in sight and before September!
BOOM! Nice little bump today! You can't go wrong with NKE.
Is supporting the lie of forced labor in Xinjiang more important than $70 billions one-day market cap from yesterday ?? It seems Nike chose the market cap.... LOL... How about H&M ??

"I see NKE has been holding in fairly strong, even as it has drifted a little lower from it's ATH of $174 on August 6th. Yahoo has a one year target of $183, but that seems a little optimistic to me. It's had a great run and based on data that we know now, has gotten ahead of itself. Nothing against NKE, but I would like to buy it at slightly lower prices. $130 sounds good, but we're unlikely to see that again. :-)"

"Whatever happened to those radicalized right-wing insurrectionists who claimed to have shorted NKE at $45? If I know those loud-mouths, they never shorted anything and they never had any stock. But their call was terrible. I love NKE and their products!"
NKE has some ways to fall. A huge gap in the charts from 135-150. Surprised that its stayed up here this long. The Fed is prolonging the fall of many stocks just like this.

why is nike racist?
No word on stock spilt? It last split at about $60/shr in Dec of 2015. It is way past that. Is this a new trend for stocks. They want to go to the $400-$600 or more to split?
Thanks shorties - have a great day and weekend
"It’s funny, most analysts predicted a earnings miss and now they are all on the Nike train. It just proves their opinion doesn’t mean do do."

"This will soon go the way of Didi, and quite deservedly so.Anyone with a scintilla of morality and common decency should buy their sneakers from another company and not hold NKE stock."
Although I am nike shareholder I barely ever comment on this stock. The reason being is that this is one of my core holding and I don't plan on ever selling. I am going to let these shares compound over the next few decades (D.R.I.P) and bask in the capital appreciation. This is a buy and never sell stock!!!
Should I buy 40k worth of Nike????
"The soaring stock price of NKE is a deeply sobering reminder that good doesn't always triumph over evil, unless we're talking about superhero movies."
nike is laying off staff and announced a $790 million loss
"Chief executive John Donahoe said “Nike is a brand that is of China and for China” Listen, I know you want to make money, but no amount of money is worth losing your soul. They use slave labor. They are fronting for the communist party. You are literally investing to ultimately get rid of yourself and your family. Do not do it. There are many other stocks to invest in."
Nike should have a pull back to the $140s
"This is outrageous! I would urge all my fellow ReTrumplicans to go out and buy some Nike products to burn in protest and in support of our Mango Mussolini. Retrumplicans Unite! All proceeds to the next peaceful Capitals Tour.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Making Accountability ""Go Away"""

"Best Overall Running Shoe1. Hoka One One Clifton 7 Since its launch a decade ago, Hoka One One has experienced a meteoric rise from polarizing “clown shoes” to a mainstream hit. And with the Clifton, they’ve put together one of the most well-rounded, versatile shoes on the market. Comfort is class-leading thanks to Hoka’s signature thick midsole, the Clifton’s 5-millimeter drop and rockered shape encourage a natural gait, and the well-designed heel (the “7” features a flared collar to ease pressure on the Achilles) and moderately roomy toe box keep your feet locked in place. All told, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better all-rounder for everything from short recovery days to marathon training.The recent growth in max-cushioned shoes means the Hoka’s tall stack height doesn’t stand out as much as it did in the past, but the unique design still has its fair share of detractors. That said, from a performance standpoint, the extra thickness hasn’t led to any stability issues for road use (although we wouldn’t take them on anything more serious than a gravel path). Our sole complaint is that the thick build takes away some of the responsiveness, so it’s not an ideal choice for those running short races (10K and under) with an eye on a personal best. But for just about every other application, the Clifton 7 is a winner. If you’re looking for even more cushion, check out the Bondi 7 below, and Hoka’s speedier Rincon 2 is a great option for race day.https://www.switchbacktravel.com/best-running-shoes"
$120 and down Check the puts and calls It’s clearly indicating the huge drop
There’s no way to minimize this quarter. Excellent on all fronts. You can argue for ethical reasons not to own this company but all that will do is cause you to miss out on enormous money making opportunities. The shorts are outmatched in this name and today they are getting destroyed. From an investment standpoint owning NKE is a no brainer.
22.5 for Chauvin
Isn't a shoe company?
Y'all OK with this?https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/560386-ceo-nike-is-a-brand-that-is-of-china-and-for-china

Fabulous long-term growth company lead by an excellent management team. 'Just do it' and Buy and hold forever!!

Short covering so stock is up now after hours. Stock price is up by almost 100% but profitabily is now. This stock price will stay around @ 160 rest of the year and good to book profit now.

"$NKE reports Subpar earnings, 30% lower than 2016, but already hyped stock gets PUMPED artificially again by the US Government!NKE 2016 P/E=20NKE 2021 P/E=120"
"I understand that NKE has performed very well for some of us over the years and is up 22% just this year alone, but it pays not to get married to a stock so you can see logically when it has stopped working for you. Yes, it has made a lot of people a lot of money, however, I believe it's gotten way ahead of itself. True, analysts have annualized five year earnings growth projections at 17%, but it also trades at a hefty 49 P/E. If analysts are right NKE will earn about 25 dollars in that five year period. For approximately the same price I like AXP much better. Trading at a 20 multiple and looking at a 22% earning growth rate, we're looking a $67 being earning over that same 5 year period. I'm buying AXP and writing calls on my NKE stock."
Edward Jones investments recommended this stock 2 weeks ago for my retired mothers portfolio. good lord were they ever right. wish I bought some lol
