NKE is extremely overbought right. Big price drop coming!!
"I expect NKE to drift lower this week, but still trade over $165."
"so free cash flow return to 2019 levels, yet now the stock is valued at 55% more since then? LOL so in the past 5 years Nike averaged less than 10% growth rate yet its priced at 40x FCF. I wonder where these analysts get their education to have a buy rating."
I can't take it anymore. This stocks is green every day. Does this stock ever stop growing?
"I've never bought or owned Nike shoes, or any big name shoe brand that throws away money to athletes on endorsement deals. The average middle class consumer who pays the astronomical high prices for these shoes are not smart!!"
130 closer than 1000 hahahahhahaha
NKE has some ways to fall. A huge gap in the charts from 135-150. Surprised that its stayed up here this long. The Fed is prolonging the fall of many stocks just like this.
"Wow, just wow. Nike you are one heck of an investment!"
I heard about NKE the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"NKE is turning into the Bitcoin of sneakers and both will soon suffer the same very bad fate.Woke tulips, anyone?"
"It’s funny, most analysts predicted a earnings miss and now they are all on the Nike train. It just proves their opinion doesn’t mean do do."
"The fact that today, August 10, NKE is one of only a handful of DJIA stocks trading down as the overall all markets are making new ATH's, tells me NKE is getting tired. The fabulous run that it's had may be taking a breather. I'm not a chartist, but some would argue that it needs to go down and fill the giant gap created back in June before another leg up."
Going to $200 by Labor Day!
Why are there so many insiders selling? OMG 
i'm planning to buy puts ahead of earnings. I think its too high right now.
"Wow, just wow Nike! You are simply an amazing stock!"
You guys still have time to get out and take profits :)
"NKE is Overvalued at $157. Its pre-earnings price was $133 (June 25), and was $126 on June 18."
why is this Chinese stock dropping?
Only two more sleeps (not scoops) until DJT is reinstated on Friday the 13th. So sayeth my QAnon newsletter.
NKE - Insiders are selling like crazy. Look at the shares sold recently. Get out why you can. Stock is wayyyy overbought.
"Love to see this so called ""woke"" company in the red."
NKE is the only stock you need to own.
"Is it the beginning of, the middle of or the end of August when 45 gets reinstated after the election turnover? Bigly?"
Zee please tell us why you think Bidumb the kid sniffer is such a good president!!!?? Please. I bet you will ignore an adult conversation like usual.
"This is a long term play, it could reach $300 eoy and have a price split! I'll buy more if it pulls back a little bit. Be a smart investor and you'll reap the rewards with a lot of patience!"
"maybe if nike let me win the raffle for the travis scoot aj1 lows, there stock would hit 200 today!!"
Get ready SHORTS. Nike is on it's way down!!!

The poster #$%$ certainly chose an ?apropo? username.
I opened a short position at the end. Ready to add more and double down.Very overbought.
"Seriously, this is getting swapped between big money buyers who keep the price where they want it. No retail buyers are looking at this thinking ""yeah, this looks like a low risk high reward investment"""
Any less than $200 is a joke. Should get there by Halloween.

Extremely low volume lol. Just big money trying to protect an overblown S/P. Toxic stock.
"NKE does appear slightly overvalued at the moment, but you can't help but admire the the 77% gain in over the past year. Since it's a great momentum stock, I certainly wouldn't be betting against it."
Insiders have been unloading and selling their shares for months now. Get out while you can. Big price drop coming. Dont say you weren't warned.
Invest 10k into this stock?
$130Down Down Down $120 $89Support $ value is $95NKE way overvalued
"just talk to a friend of mine in Vietnam that works for NKE, factory shut down for the last 2 weeks and they told him it will be closed until VN gets a handle on COVID-19, it's getting worse, shortages of food due to panic buying..."
"I know I have been warned, but exactly what is the timing of this? I've been warned since 2017 when NKE was $50 and Colin Kaepernick had the audacity to quietly and peacefully knell in protest of inequity. Is NKE headed all the way back to $150 or will fundamentals keep the stock higher than that. Since value investors overrule biased feeling, inquiring minds want to know. LOL..."
Your chance today to do a buy/write on NKE for September 3 expiration on either 162.5 or 165 strike price. Own the stock on the August 27 X date and collect the $1.10 dividend and get assigned on September 3 and collect the $1.00 premium. Not bad for eight business day's work.
"I understand that NKE has performed very well for some of us over the years and is up 22% just this year alone, but it pays not to get married to a stock so you can see logically when it has stopped working for you. Yes, it has made a lot of people a lot of money, however, I believe it's gotten way ahead of itself. True, analysts have annualized five year earnings growth projections at 17%, but it also trades at a hefty 49 P/E. If analysts are right NKE will earn about 25 dollars in that five year period. For approximately the same price I like AXP much better. Trading at a 20 multiple and looking at a 22% earning growth rate, we're looking a $67 being earning over that same 5 year period. I'm buying AXP and writing calls on my NKE stock."
The sky is falling. The sky I falling!!
$176 by tomorrow
China slowdown devastating news for nikeSearch china slowdown read it for yourself China largest market for nike Will you be snookered by wall st pros out of big gains ?
"China & US politic are getting worse. All Chinese stocks are down. NKE stock will be effective due to big market in China, time to buy PUTS!"
Nike CEO & CFO are selling shares as of August 5th
How would you feel tomorrow knowing that you could have sold your NKE stake today at a decent profits?
Should I buy 40k worth of Nike????
"I bought NKE way back when the insurrection party boycotted Nike. In fact, I have bought other companies that were boycotted by the insurrection party. In all cases, those stocks outperformed the market after being banned by the insurrection party! Thank you, NKE, for quadrupling my investment!"
"I see NKE has been holding in fairly strong, even as it has drifted a little lower from it's ATH of $174 on August 6th. Yahoo has a one year target of $183, but that seems a little optimistic to me. It's had a great run and based on data that we know now, has gotten ahead of itself. Nothing against NKE, but I would like to buy it at slightly lower prices. $130 sounds good, but we're unlikely to see that again. :-)"
Wait wait wait is that a hanging man candlestick forming today?
"I expect NKE to fade towards the end of the day. It's had a nice run, including that nice $20 gap up back in June. I'm rolling out some 167.5 calls today to pick up a few extra bucks. If I get called at that price sometime, I'm not going to complain, it's been a nice ride, but I think there are some better values out there at the moment."
Remember to buy your shoes on Friday. New orders always come in on Friday's . You don't want to buy shoes that have been there 24 hours or longer.
No word on stock spilt? It last split at about $60/shr in Dec of 2015. It is way past that. Is this a new trend for stocks. They want to go to the $400-$600 or more to split?
Stock is way overreacting... should really fall before hitting 168
"With both stocks selling for the same price, AXP is the winner in this horse race. You can check out today's price action. There will be some rotation out of NKE which has already had a nice run, into stocks with more potential upside."
It’s time to split the Nike stock 3 to 1.
