"an immediate 35% haircut over temporary supply chain issues seems a tad extreme. IMHO this is overdone to the downside. I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is and start a position today. I find myself shopping there a lot; got my nespresso machine there, got my magic bullet there, buy all my nespresso coffee there; kitchen stuff - oh yeah forgot; got my kitchen aid machine there as well. I'm always getting those 20% off any one item coupons in the mail and I use them. I got my nespresso vertuo there for 137.00. It was 159 at the target store next door so with that coupon BBBY does have very competitive prices. Time to buy some stock."
These guys just downgraded this company 2 weeks ago . Let them go find something else better to do beside downgrading BBBY!!

BBBY is one of the most janky small caps out there right now. Some volume will send it into pinball mode. There is virtually no float left on it and bears are in total control of it at the moment. It is a hedge fund battle field right now. It’s going over $100+ at some point in the next 6 months.
"Who is the next Sears? Bed Bath and Beyond or Kohls? I dont know, but i wouldnt want to own these lemons"
"I think they can realistically earn $200M in net income. With the current share price of $14.08 and repurchase plan of $425M shares, you are looking at around 30M shares repurchased (out of 101M outstanding). This leads to $2.85 EPS which is a PE of 5 at current price by the end of 2023.Bullish, hodl, strong buy."
The comments here seem to be missing the huge earnings miss. Earnings of .04 vs. .52 expected is enormous.
Down in premarket because of Morgan Stanley downgrade to underperform with 14 price target. Nice buying opportunity! It will close in green today
But seriously BBBY ain't going nowhere but down for at least next 6 months.It will be bad especially in December. Logistics issues are here to stay for a while. Not good for any retailer especially for a struggling one like BBBY.
"1.4 billion in cash… assets are of high value, decent operating cash….. & ton of money spent on share repurchases. Tells you extremely undervalued this company is, gg to all the shorts they’ll get squeezed once again"
"Save some bullets for the $10 range, theres no hurry to pile in now as the challenges will not go away anytime soon. Maybe 2023 sees a turnaround. I sure miss the late 90s when she split ever few years, but today is a far cry from that. The stock is an avoid for a while."
bbby rdy to explode soon small float we can take it to 300 with more volume and buyers
"Shorts are thirsty but this stock trading so cheap, they will be forced tf out at any point"
Nothing special about this company. Everything they sell I can buy on Amazon
After 6 day down there is usually a rebound - let’s see what happens tomorrow….and in addition it’s 52 week low
"Short covering on Friday, we have 2 days squeezing rally’s"
The 2 weeks Bad ER rule strikes again. Wait!! Don't rush BBBY will get only cheaper. Plenty of shares available folks.

"Stock is down 50% since august, they may as well go private at this pace. With all the share buybacks…. the float vs shorts is going to be a war, it’s not going to end well"
"Bullish Keynotes from Q2 conference delivering a strong holiday is our key focus.our operational transformation remains on trackOur digital channel represented 34% of total net salesNovember has historically represented nearly half of the sales for Q3 due to the fans gaming sales period, inclusive of the Black Friday selling periodSolidifying our capital availability further, we improved terms and increased our asset-based revolving credit facility to $1 billion in August, bringing our total liquidity to $2 billionwe opened our new Northeast regional distribution center. These developments are instrumental to our end-to-end transformational strategy and will help in the long-term control and protection from supply chain stresswe should benefit from our ongoing initiatives, including the increasing penetration and growth of our new owned brands, better market-based prices, more effective data-driven promotion and markdown strategy and supply chain and freight optimization.we are well-positioned to continue delivering on our transformation. We have the plan, the team and the capital to unlock our potential.Our in-stock rates are very solid. We're kind of at the same in stock rate in September pretty much that we were in June. So our teams have been working with their key national brand vendors remembering that while 20% of our penetration is owned brand, 80% is great national brands"
I think we can never find Bed Bath & Beyond once again at this level. Good time to jump in. $20 is very easy!
bbby will survive
"Went long BBBY at 16.16, downside is almost non-existent from this level, short-medium term upside - 100% (when the next short squeeze happen, and it definitely will happen). With so little debt and great asset value it is now also a buyout target. Shorts are about to go busted."
Some of you asked why I posted about BBBY not being an essential but only nice to have retailer. Well let me ask this. Do you think if Walmart was to close all of its stores today would that have a big impact on consumers? Heck yeah especially a low income consumers and that impact would last for a while. But if BBBY was to go out of business would anyone miss it. NOPE! I am not saying BBBY is going out of business but it is not an essential retailer.
Soon or maybe even today except a few down grades. It is not looking good and holidays are coming up fast. If they don't resolve their supply issues BBBY will see a single digits before Thanksgiving.
BBBY accelerated share repurchase program which is part of our authorized level for share repurchases up to $825 million until end of the year

"In Q1 2021, BBBY experienced 49.5% revenue growth while still increasing their gross margins to 32.4% through streamlining their operations. Additionally, their past 4 quarters of online sales have all had consecutive sales growth, breaking the seasonal trend and showing a great movement towards e-commerceQ2 should be even better for them as they have continued streamlining operations and expect to post over 2B in revenueBBBY has over 1.2 BILLION dollars of cash on-hand which they can use to continue moving towards e-commerce, create in-house products, and keep up growth. That cash alone is almost all of their ENTIRE market cap, not even including additional assets!!!Management has seen how undervalued their company is and has repurchased $130m shares to take advantage of this, with more share purchases to come. This shows how strong of a position they are in and how confident management is that their stock will increase in the future.r/wallstreetbets - BBBY: Undervalued and OvershortedEven though they are focusing on growth instead of profitability right now, BBBY’s P/E ratio is STILL in line with the S@P 500 averageOk... now that you understand how undervalued this company is, let me introduce to you the managementManagement:Management is one of, if not the most important factors for how well a company will do, and BBBY has some of the best management a company could hope forMark Tritton, the current CEO, has had over 30 years of experience in retail and oversaw Target’s streamlining and digital transformation as Executive VP. He has a clear vision for the company and has the industry connections and know-how to get it doneGustavo Arnal, the current CFO, has had experience turning around struggling companies before, most notably Avon. He has experience leading WBA’s global division and can help the company reach international marketsJohn Hartmann, the current COO, has had experience being the CEO of True Value Company which focused on hardwear. He also has experience working in Home Depot’s digital transformation program. He can help BBBY create some products of their own while guiding this digital pushThere are many more amazing people on the leadership team, but these 3 are the ones who stand out to me due to their unique abilities in certain fieldsManagement is what creates and directs a company’s visions and operations. With these 3 people on their team, BBBY covers all needed areas; Digital transformation, global supply-chains, hardwear production, and financial streamliningShorts:Despite being in such a good position, BBBY still has a 23% short interest left over from the whole meme stock surge in January(edited)"

"WOW !Taking A Real""BATH"" TODAY !"
Will BBBY bounce today? It's probably due after 40% sell off but it will not alter the downward trajectory until the next ER. Still too expensive IMO.

Bought BBBY. Insiders are buy at $25+ and $27+https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/886158.htm
"Since SNOW is the most expensive money losing company stock on the market with extremely pathetic tiny, tiny sales, we can actually compare SNOW stock valuation to any stock on the market and see that SNOW is extremely overvalued. Let me do one example comparison to show you how expensive SNOW stock is. SNOW stock market cap is gigantic $97 billion dollars. $BBBY stock market cap is only $1.5 billion dollars. SNOW quarterly revenues last quarter were extremely pathetic tiny, tiny $272 million dollars. BBBY quarterly revenues last quarter were $2 billion dollars. SNOW market cap is crazy 65 times larger than BBBY, but BBBY revenues were actually 7 times larger than SNOW. SNOW stock is so extremely expensive that SNOW stock price can fall 99% and its price-to-sales valuation will still be 4 times more expensive than BBBY valuation. It is foolish for anyone to still own this most expensive money losing company Snowflake (SNOW). This junk Snowflake company is just like its name. It is just a Snowflake with no substance at all."
It's way too cheap given the revenue and cash to market cap. Even with the stated supply chain challenges and reduction of estimates the drop is significantly overdone. Given the heavy short interest this has a very nice setup.
"Hmm i think shorts are just playing around, trying to cover cheap. But they already have lost long term. The new team brings this diversified business on track."
This stock is criminally cheap. If you think that in 3-6 months supply chain issues will ease this is a no brainer

"Sometimes logic doesn't work. Nor does anecdotal evidence. I lived near a Target store for decades. Prior to that it was a Gemco. I thought Gemco was fine, wasn't crazy about Target, but I shopped there. Was annoyed when they canceled the garden section. Never shopped at Walmart until recently, because where I live it's the only cheap alternative for groceries and certain other products. Neither Target nor Walmart impress me as a consumer, but they're making money. The stock market approves of Target and Walmart as if they are wonderful places to shop. No. They are boring and limited. Bed, Bath and Beyond always seemed like a better choice for certain products, but they screwed up somehow. It's a tricky world. BBBY might fight its way back by presenting the consumer with better choices than TGT and WMT, but the world doesn't always follow logic. Like I said, I thought Gemco was fine. They even had a gas station. Oh, wait. That was in the 1970s, Carter administration, oil embargo days..."

None.You might get an occasional bounce here and there but until BBBY can show to the big investors that turn around is for real BBBY won't get above $17-$18.Will probably test $10 and shorts will push it just to test its support.
"Back to $50 before end of the year, which it would be only 5B market cap, 50% of their revenue, Q4 is shopping sales quarter"
Big miss! Total Revenue: $1.99 billion vs. $2.06 billion expectedAdjusted EBITDA: $85 million vs. $156.2 million expectedAdjusted EPS: $0.04 vs. $0.52 expected
"Short interest info from Yahoo Statistics:% Held by Institutions 108.98%Shares Short (Sep 15, 2021) 22.04MShort % of Float (Sep 15, 2021) 48.43%With the Institutions holding nearly 109% of the float that means they own everything and have bought some more shares from investors that sold short. This stock could have a short squeeze like Volkswagen did a few years back. If the Institutions don't sell their shares, there simply isn't enough shares available to cover at any price!"
BBBY is not an essential retailer. If economy goes into recession why would you shop at overpriced store? You wouldn't and even without recession BBBY is in trouble. Customers are leaving Once gone they never come back. Again I am not shorting BBBY. I would say so if I did. BBBY won't go bankrupt right away if it ever does but I think it is a good short term trade. When it gets to below $12 I will start trading it (mostly day trading).
"RSI is 17, 30 is oversold. This will bounce hard, simply due to technicalities. We are playing the stock market not literally retail. GL to all"
"Sorry guys, I think this is going to 11. Good luck to all! I have no positions."
"This stock is highly manipulated & in the mud, valuation is broken rip"

"they only covered 130k shares today no worries they are betting it will go dow further, just hold and buy if u can to hurt them"

"This was near 30 few days ago. It miss sales in 10%, but that was also in the price of 22. Common sense this should be 25 now"
"Recent Insider buying with $XOS is in oversold with gape up , analyst rating of $15"

"Zacks Strong Sell means buy, a lot."
"As soon as the children of Reddit wake up from their parent's basement, pour themselves a bowl of Fruity Pebbles and after they play 2 hours of COD they will see this stock went down and take action. Arise Children of Reddit"
It doesn't look good. Sorry guys don't mean to sound like an ars but this could see $10 in a few days.
$20 on horizon
Stock at a 2 year low with out any problems and lots of cash flow... There is going to be a pop lets seeeeee. The stock should not be lower than 20.00....... So it will be back to that in a few days.

BBBY actually had a pretty good quarter. Considering supply chain issue the miss wasn’t much.
"Bed Bath & Beyond is furthering its partnership with DoorDash to provide on-demand delivery of homeware products from more than 700 Bed Bath & Beyond locations and 120 buybuy BABY stores nationwide.

The move is also in sync with the company’s digital-first transformation plan. It is likely to leverage on DoorDash’s platform to expand the customer base."
Acquisition Time
Consumers stopped buying random stuffs (since there is no more free money) - heading to a steep fall in retail sector.Cash will be King not stocks/cryto/real estate - we went through this in 2001 / 2007 / 2014 and it's about time.
Bed Bath & Bankrupt should be the new name for this stock next year
"With a forward PE of 9 & over $2 billion of liquidity available this company will weather any storm… the worst is already priced in & the RSI is 15!!!! Gl shorts, I’m holding a ton of shares"
"BEARS, the panic begins "

shorted 1k shares at $24.
I think it's about the time for BBBY to celebrate the anniversary of MEME frenzy and short squeeze tomorrow. Most stocks did so after a catalyst. Tomorrow there's a big catalyst (earnings report) to move the stock up to $30 then respectively to $40. Of course if the earnings are positive. If positive then you can go all in. Just wake up a bit early :) Good Luck!
Hey @BigO what happened son? I don't see $20-$22 bounce yet? As I've been saying folks not until $12. Even at $12 IMO BBBY is still too expensive.
"For every dip, retail bought them leaving no available shares for shorts to cover. Dangerous game for shorty"

Over reaction 1.99B miss the 2B wow
Stock acting as if company shutting down soon. I shop here. It's a good store with interesting stuff. No different that 100 other home staple stores - all of whose stocks are soaring despite modest earnings. I'm buying at these level and will check back a couple of months later.
big short squeeze coming.

BBBY has become a new favorite trade of mine. Great volatility and the last dead cat bounce was an easy short indicator.
"Shorts…. There is only one way out, to buy back the shares like the bums you all areEnjoy the easy money rally… I hope you guys lose everything"
"You got the ex-Target guy, you got a rebuild of stores and online, you got mounting short interest... This may take a while, but I like the odds. Been trading it for the last few years, will hold core position for long term. It's a Phoenix! (Born in Greece, apparently moved to Arizona.)"
No recovery for BBBY until at least mid 2022. Logistics will takes 6 months minimum to go back to somewhat normal level but then the economy might be in recession. Just not good.$12 in a few days.
"1.4B Cap, 1.4B Cash, 9B revenue Q4 revenue is always double do to Black Friday month, holidays and cyber holidays sales"
45% float shorted... thats huge $$$$
1.6 market cap vs 1.2 liquidation value. only positive about this stock
"Institutional ownership is nearly 109%. That means some Institutions have purchased shares from short sellers. Short interest is just under 50%. Reddit doesn't need to jump on this one. If the company used some of their funds allocated to buybacks to pick up a few million low priced shares, I predict the short squeeze would start. IMO."
When the stock jump to $90 it will be 1X the revenue
"This pumped with GME because they started seeing margin call reserves redline. Whatch GME this week and BBBY pump as well. Dominos, Dominos.."
$BBBY $30 coming everyone! you been warned!
BBBY will trade between $8-$12 IMO for the foreseeable future. And no I am not a short.
