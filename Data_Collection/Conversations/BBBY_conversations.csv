"They bought $100 million in share repurchases for approximately 3 million shares"" $100 million /3 million shares = 33$ per share. They paid 33$ when the average price was around 28$ and now....I guess they are sleeping. I Sold out with a 2% loss today...stop for me!"
Amazon missed ! And said it was because :.. in the third quarter people returned to 'store' shopping because of the population being vaccinated ..' [good for bbby]

"So, if Ill buy BBBY for 1.4B Cash, I’ll get 100% ownership plus 1.4B Cash? Free money at its best"
Down in premarket because of Morgan Stanley downgrade to underperform with 14 price target. Nice buying opportunity! It will close in green today
"In Q1 2021, BBBY experienced 49.5% revenue growth while still increasing their gross margins to 32.4% through streamlining their operations. Additionally, their past 4 quarters of online sales have all had consecutive sales growth, breaking the seasonal trend and showing a great movement towards e-commerceQ2 should be even better for them as they have continued streamlining operations and expect to post over 2B in revenueBBBY has over 1.2 BILLION dollars of cash on-hand which they can use to continue moving towards e-commerce, create in-house products, and keep up growth. That cash alone is almost all of their ENTIRE market cap, not even including additional assets!!!Management has seen how undervalued their company is and has repurchased $130m shares to take advantage of this, with more share purchases to come. This shows how strong of a position they are in and how confident management is that their stock will increase in the future.r/wallstreetbets - BBBY: Undervalued and OvershortedEven though they are focusing on growth instead of profitability right now, BBBY’s P/E ratio is STILL in line with the S@P 500 averageOk... now that you understand how undervalued this company is, let me introduce to you the managementManagement:Management is one of, if not the most important factors for how well a company will do, and BBBY has some of the best management a company could hope forMark Tritton, the current CEO, has had over 30 years of experience in retail and oversaw Target’s streamlining and digital transformation as Executive VP. He has a clear vision for the company and has the industry connections and know-how to get it doneGustavo Arnal, the current CFO, has had experience turning around struggling companies before, most notably Avon. He has experience leading WBA’s global division and can help the company reach international marketsJohn Hartmann, the current COO, has had experience being the CEO of True Value Company which focused on hardwear. He also has experience working in Home Depot’s digital transformation program. He can help BBBY create some products of their own while guiding this digital pushThere are many more amazing people on the leadership team, but these 3 are the ones who stand out to me due to their unique abilities in certain fieldsManagement is what creates and directs a company’s visions and operations. With these 3 people on their team, BBBY covers all needed areas; Digital transformation, global supply-chains, hardwear production, and financial streamliningShorts:Despite being in such a good position, BBBY still has a 23% short interest left over from the whole meme stock surge in January(edited)"
"Stock drop 40% (1.3B) because Q2 earning was 1.99B instead of 2B from some random analyst guess estimate, anyway this manipulation creates opportunity, BBBY strong transformation is on track, to be the best e-commerce in North America with their own brands create by top best designers at competitive prices"
Retail Federation forecasts a record holiday shopping seasonhttps://on.mktw.net/2ZqgjyH
"3 Month ago 2 price Targets $40 and $42, what change this quarter beside holidays shopping season?"
The latest report shows that Institutional ownership has increased to over 111%. Institutions continue to buy shares from short sellers. I do not see this ending well for the shorts.
Tomorrow is the last day of tax-loss selling by institutional investors. BBBY will fly in November and December. Time to load up! Easy 50% gain in a matter of months!
Cramer say buy BBBY https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-jim-cramer-stocks-130044951.html
"Online sells double in October, they going to start early Black Friday sales now and it’s going to be the all month in November"
"""During the quarter, we executed approximately $100 million in share repurchases for approximately 3 million shares"" management said during the last conference call. It looks that $100 million /3 million shares = 33$ per share. They OVERPAID the stocks by a lot!"
And this is red again because?????
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while BBBY barley does anything at all."
BBBY looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://alert-sounds.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
"Any day from now, BBBY will be acquired because its business is big, no debt, lots of real estate, good CEO but its market cap is only $1.4B vs. Five Below's $10B vs. Target $75B. Wow $1.4B is easy money for these other retailers. Any day now."
"Black Friday Sale on the stock, 1.3B Cap, they going to make 1.3B just in November"
