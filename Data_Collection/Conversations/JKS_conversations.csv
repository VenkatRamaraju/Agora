The 6 Best Up & Coming Stocks To Buy Right Now! For details https://youtu.be/UyYUmQW9WJU
"The most obvious reason to push this stock price down is to make a killing in China. Anyone who doesn't catch on to this, must be blind or naive. Daqo has proven that the Shanghai IPO's fetch a massive premium, and that in China, these companies get valued as their peers do (Trina, JA Solar, Tongwei, Xinte, etc.) By pushing the price as low as possible, any hedge fund (could be Morgan Stanley, too, since the STAR IPO is not only available to Chinese investors) that can get in on that IPO can buy up an ever larger percentage of Jinko for practically nothing, and make a fortune the first day this baby trades in STAR. As I already posted, if the Jinko price can be kept around $40-50, they'll have to sell 25% or more to get the $1B capital they are looking to get, leaving us US longs with less than 50% of the company, but without any gurantees that arbitraging will happen. (It's certainly not happening for DQ....) I'm ever more convinced of the fact that there are powerful hedge funds behind this to walk away with billions in a few months. A no brainer...."
Now...Oversold
I am not greedy. I sold 3000 shares average at 51. 6 and close my position. I made 8 per share. Good luck everyone!
Nice job everyone who bought and did not sell...they will probably try to bring it down again a bit....I am not selling mine....NOPE....60 minimum. This stock price should be triple digits.
JUNKo has 20 BILLION in DEBT... and rising 20-30% a year with interest expense to service that mountain of debt SKYROCKETING... Bankruptcy is 100% GUARANTEED!!!!!
Trina solar went private at 1.2 billion value few years ago. Today it is trading around 15 billions value in China. It's more than 12 times market cap.
Is that market cap on yahoo finance accurate?
Pre-market going UP!
been watching it for years. play ups and downs. can't lose
And another world record on solar cell efficiency - 25.4% - WOW Jinko!!! :)
"Days like these, one needs some good news. Blackrock, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley and other big players have been loading up on Jinko. That's probably what helped us longs get out of that hole at $29.... Enjoy the weekend!"
"$60 again will be nice!!! All Chinese stocks (BIDU BABA JD DQ JKS NIO XPEV, etc.) are up as well...GLTA!"
The insiders have told us that JKS will have good margins going down the road. They didn't buy up 26% of JKS so they could put up over a third of what JKS made by selling stock. JKS is going to be making so much money they never have to sell stock again. JKS is going to go up a lot.
My Price Target still 200$ for 2023 !!!
Doomplayer clearly a 
Good news! Going up in pre-market!
Just hold! Going up!
Haha. Put your seatbelts on! 
"crazy how it got bought up to $55.99 and then big sellers came in! Just hold your shares...you will be glad :). No reason why this is not >$70....i mean it is one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world, now has partnership for storing energy...and have you seen in how many countries JKS SELLS???? this is worth much more than a $2B market cap.....geesh there are companies with much higher valuations that do not have nearly as much potential and do not have nearly the revenue or profit (will be much more once jinko can get expenses down)!"
"Jinko is 70 usd Stock.China needs Solarenergy as you can actually see.Jinko will explode soon , the beginning with listing in Shanghai soon."
I couldn't believe my eyes today and have been waiting all day for a correction from 45GW to 35GW module capacity.... What an amazing change from last quarter if that number is really true!
"Is this true that JINKO will be removed from US market? I heard that, and now people selling this. Often Chinese news are not told in English."
"Hello Pat,It´s my pleasure to admit that the timing for your (re) - entry timing has been perfect - again!(Jinkosolar/Wacker deal). Furthermore,it will be interesting to hear the conference call of Daqo - i.e. whether they adress the huge discount of ADR to Daqo Xinjing valuation. As Jinkosolar ""always does ,what the market is doing"" any hint regarding a share swap/redemption of ADRs into China listed shares could stop risky shortselling and trigger appreciation of the share price instead.This would foremost impact Daqo but with a view on Jinkosolar´s STAR market listing raise the speculation of Jinko doing the same.Nevertheless as for this morning I´ll like to send my congratulations to you .Christian"
"tips for tomorrow, check $10B buyback from QCOM issued AH..."
I sold 3000 shares that bought at 43.4 to take $2 per share profits. I still have 3000 shares that bought at 44.7!
Bankruptcy fears are alive and well. No one can pay down $28 B debt.
"I honestly dont get this, it went to $60 after earning due to good growth and sales numbers. Then a day later it starts to sell off, down 35% in less than 2 weeks, with any real news other than some political bs that does not change their fundamentals. Really frustrating."
"When Evergrande fall down a few days ago jinko fall down a lot , but now Evengrande rise up and Jinko keeps go down . Someone can explain it to me ?"
this stock is about to make me another 50k east over the next month. I'll do you a favor. invest anywhere between 35 and 45 and sell anywhere between 55-65 . prepare to hold long term. average down when appropriate . done it 3 times already $JKS isn't going anywhere. and definitely isn't going bankrupt  LFG 
I’m looking forward to shorts getting absolutely fried when these earnings are great on the 15th
Jinko preliminary 9 month disclosure through Sept for revenues and net income for the subsidiary does not look like strong earnings. It might even suggest a loss based on the first 2 quarters results. No wonder it is tanking.
look a book value of 220 something strange what holds down this sp.

"Canadian Solar’s results have very positive implications for JKS…. Gross margins are likely to be much better than guidance AGAIN: pricing is moving up for modules, cost increases are stabilizing and these trends are going to be repeated in the third quarter.My guess is JKS will do better than 17% gross margin in q2 and q3 will be 18% to 20%! That’s much better than what perennially bearish (and wrong!) Wall Street analysts are saying right now."
"It sure didn’t want to, but We broke $51 for about 30 seconds, haha! Huge resistance at 51. Wait until that wall gets brought down….. when it does, see you at $60!"
Once more into the breach 
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
This is a good bankruptcy candidate like evergrande ! Too much debt and can't issue more shares ! Stay away !
"Yup, also confirmed in the PPT slide deck graphic. They had 31 GW capacity at end of June, and if they get close to the 30GW high-end prediction (I consider that unlikely, but would be very happy with 28 GW), it would be a fairly decent utilization rate compared to the industry average. Even if the added no further capacity in 2022, it would imply that Jinko could be selling close to about $10B worth of products by the end of 2022. For how much longer can the shorts keep them at around the ridiculous $2B market cap?"
"""What we might be seeing is the market reverse its thinking on solar import restrictions. Instead of a headwind, like it might seem to be for JinkoSolar, it could be a tailwind because of the company's U.S. presence."" Golf clap to this author for trying to apply logic to JKS. Daqo outshined everyone today with no ties to the US that I'm aware of."
"As I said, no big dream for Jinko! I bought some at 44.7!"
Today going up in pre-market.
Finally I sold all the shares above 50. Good luck everyone! As I said no big dream for me. Jinko is my ATM machine.
I don’t see how any company has revenue of nearly 5B and their market cap is 2.2B.
Fourth quarter shipments: the company is expecting to sell at least 10 GW of modules. Important to note that this number is higher than the company’s quarterly production capacity. The company has bought enough raw materials and has been building inventories in Q2 and Q3 to enable potential shipments to be as high as 14 GW - if the demand is there.
"I wrote this in 'Seeking Alpha' a week ago and no one read it'This could be a blessing in disguise for Jinko. Jinko is the only major Chinese solar company having manufacturing capabilities in US (Jacksonville, Florida). This could be Jinko's way to alleviate the tariff and WRO'It is the reason why Jinko went up todayhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3731704-jinkosolar-climbs-on-long-term-supply-deal-with-wacker-chemie"
Jks has energy today. All the bears hide away LOL. No more bankruptcy talk!
JKS and DQ are the best Chinese stocks !!!
"All quiet on the western front.... Chinese solar stocks close to record highs. The ones trading in US, variable valuations."
"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (JKS) stock skyrocketing in premarket, here’s why? https://goo.io/investorsobserver.com"
"forgive me, I don't have much experience reading earnings reports.. Did JKS turn profitable during a global pandemic AND sign multiple deals to hedge geopolitical targeting? This stock plays with my emotions daily, just looking for reassurance to keep holding."
Time to buy more ;)
I feel earnings will be awesome.People are loading up my on panels the world over. A big bump in stock price will help mr jinko fulfill his happy journey
Must love BABA JKS DQ NVAX DVAX guys!
Can anyone who knows tell me what’s driving this stock down everyday? I think it’s unrelated to the crackdown unless of course investors are just dumping all Chinese stocks.
Seems like someone is pushing a false narrative hard
What a newssss
"Careful when shorts take up almost 3X of average daily volume figure, especially at over bought area. This is JKS, not John Deere. Accumulated blocks at $41.88 this morning."
Jinkosolar is ahead of its competitors in diversifying the supply chain to avoid getting caught up in the ongoing trade dispute. Its future- forward approach includes signing polysilicon supply deals with Wacker and building up wafer plant in Vietnam.
Building the future
Someone knows when Jinko listing in Shanghai?????
"Thank Jinko, it's going up today! I unloaded the shares average at 44.4! I bought at 42.4 and 41.7 yesterday. Still hold the shares that bought at 44.55!"
"Serious question - anyone here considers de-listing a possibility?I personally don't as it would limit company from getting source of funding in case it needs it.Yes, short cnts are using US listing as shorting stock but nonetheless when STAR comes in it makes sense to keep both up as US side would inevitable arbitrage to local (or get quite close).THing is - I am long 2023 options on Jinko and if it gets delisted it turns NULL, if it stays on, then I am loading more. Just thinking out loud, would be good to hear your views gents."
"This is crazy, Dow, and Nasdaq are soaring and we are red again."
BIG SHORT SQUEEZE ON Chinese stocks like BABA BIDU JD JKS DQ DIDI NIO XPEV LI and BA!
"Today 48+, Monday 50+"
"This stock is so strange, it was over $60 only a few weeks ago after a great earning, then it dropped to $38 with no bad news at all, now its popping with no news either. But it deserves to be higher. Congratulations for those who bought in under $40 just less than 2 weeks ago while everyone else were panicking :)"
"MASSIVE DISASTER... Year over year revenues FELL 6.2%, while year over year EPS FELL 10.2%... JUNKO has NEGATIVE GROWTH... they produce more and sell LESS IN REVENUES & PROFITS... while the MASSIVE DEBT IS SKYROCKETING.... 20 BILLION IN DEBT NOW.... Interest expense is SKYROCKETING... Junko bankrupt in 2023..."
"Jinko’s listing on the STAR market is likely to happen in the next few months, earlier than the 2022 that was previously expected. The valuation is also likely to be 50% to 100% higher than the valuation in the US market. This will allow them to raise larger amounts of capital at much lower cost and even pay down some debt. This would be the mecahnism by which the price and valuation gap between US and Chonese markets will narrow."
JKS going to $60.
"JKS blows out earnings, it ups ups and only ups from here, buy all you can!"
Watch out for $30
Hold
"Xi initiative and international boycott will puch this to Single digit, if not bankruptcy !!"
Go jinko!!!
"How great it is to know what the fourth quarter is holding for this company. Module prices finally took a good move up around 4-5% (polysilicon 15% !!!). Inflation isn't just happening with coal, oil and gas boys and girls...."
"funny, every time jinko spikes we hear more unsubstantiated forced labour claims against jinko. No evidence connecting Hoshine, nevermind jinko's supplier Germany's Wacher Chemie. This seems like more of the Gordon Johnson mis-information bs."
I sold the shares that was bought yesterday. 45.7-43.1=2.6 per share profit. Still hold the share bought at 44.55!
"Down below 52! These big guys play games and think we are going to fall for it See you at 60, suckazzzz "
What is your feelings for tomorrow ?
Wowwwwwww
Nickel-Hydrogen Batteryhttps://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/nickel-hydrogen-battery-for-large-scale-renewables/
I like how shorts post FUD on Yahoo finance as if this is what will swing the price down. We're out here buying a few hundred shares lol.
"We just finished a HUGE 2 year project up in the Midwest. Consisting of OVER 750,000 Solar Panels. I might start a position in JKS."
One day the market cap of Jinko Solar will be $10B … you know what it means ….. Long and strong
"very choppy today, but hopefully we will end above $50 today."
SOL upgraded.
add more at 43.4!
WOW! The open interest of calls for sept 17 for 45 50 55 60 65 70 is in the THOUSANDS! The big money shorts will need to cover and load up on calls and shares.IMO this could easily go to beyond 65-70 with excellent earnings…Your thoughts???(Good morning )
"Some excellent news again with longterm agreement with Wacker. Just like Jinko did with Xinte (sourcing polysilicion in Mongolia instead of Xinjiang), they are now going to source a significant amount of polysilicon from US/German plants which will (theoretically) allow them to manufacture safely for US/European markets free of tariffs and supply chain woes."
"The volatility in JKS is mind boggling. I have caught the channel trade a few times and will continue, seems like it just bounces between 40-60 back and forth..."
pure manipulation!!!
When the shorts cover and this shoots up 13% in a day you'll wish you bought more.
Average 45
$60 this week baby!!!!!!!!
Jinko is a great company with even short squeeze potential
"Funny, instead of shorts getting progress on tariffs for imports from vietnam and malaysia they get IPO update... ouch. Will be interesting now that judge asked the anonymous requesters to name themselves."
I have seen it crashing before too and then it resurrects itself like a phoenix! Its fundamentals are solid. I sold juicy Puts today.
"Shorts have gone from 200k shares to 600k shares in the last day... and we still went up 3%! This is normally the most they'll sell short. If we hold, the stock will swing up 5-10% in the next four days as they cover."
Crazy jinko
Pulled the trigger at 44.97 this morning with my 1450 shares. had them for just about 2 years with a $15 average. I'll be keeping an eye out for this to bottom and get back in. good luck to everyone!
"Jinko is aiming to ship over 10 GW in modules in Q4, basically doubling revenues from third quarter to excess of $2.5 billion. Earnings could be well over $1.50 in Q4. Yes the company has disappointed in the first half of this year, but this is not the time to give up."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"With the CATL deal, JKS will now become one of the big players in the energy storage business. Nice!"
Ridicolous
Pre-market 52.47 :)
This is the future
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
profitable? check. So lets go...
@Phillip I didn't short Jks and I believe the Solar rally just begun. I learned the lesson not to hold Chinese Solar for long term. I wait the pull back then hit and run few points. I don't mind Jks goes up. I have no big dream for it.
"The volatility in JKS is just nuts! I have been in an out and in and out....honestly think holding for the long term is the way to go so I do not miss out on a 100%, 200% jump...when this goes.....this goes!"
Has anyone wondered whom Jinko sold the 792 MW cells & wafers to the first quarter and whom they continue to sell wafers and cells to? Jinko is now #4 vendor of modules for H1/21 after being number 1 for 2016-2019 and 2nd last year. So they are willing to forgo maintaining their output lead in order to reign in potential losses? Wouldn't it be ironic if Jinko sold some of those wafers/cells to Trina or JA Solar?

"As I said, this is a trading stock. No big dream!"
Last year this time it was $90.... a year later is at $45... next year will be at $22.5.... market it down...
Must own JKS DQ BABA BIDU for life guys!
JinkoSolar Holding is up 12.73% to 50.11
US shareholders own ZERO of the company. The ADS shares of Chinese companies are structured that way that they do NOT own any part of the company. So if Junko or Daqo decides to pull out of the US stock market they can do that with US shareholders getting ZERO. There is a great article about that on WSJ. I suggest you guys read it.
Great future
"Wow, JKS up 3 points today!"
I took my 3 points per share profits and walk away. It's $7500 profits in two hour. Thanks JKS!
what is all this bankruptcy talk anyway???
Rotation into solar has begun. Short shares also down under 6 million... enjoy.
Thanks to (http://trademarketview.tech) I have saved hours of research for stock picks. Their daily watchlists help me make the most of my trades each day!
"Special interest/Hedge fund henchman Gordon Johnson of GLJ research lowered the firm's price target on JinkoSolar to $10.70 from $12.94 and keeps a Sell rating on the shares following yesterday's Q2 results. Who is this guy?GLJ Research (Gordon Johnson):* A twisted mind with ulterior motives e.g. he pretends to cover 'Alt Energy' but ends up giving SELL rating top practically every company (72% Sells including calls for TSLA to go bankrupt since the demand for their cars is collapsing!)* A classic FUD proponent who is amongst the worst of the worst in terms of track record, Ranked #7,365 out of 7,641 Analysts on TipRanks (#15,268 out of 15,783 overall experts) with a average return of NEGATIVE 7% ... he is actually be a good contrarian play!* He is delusion about his own competence, which he only maintains by lying to himself. No big research firms would hire him - but infact he was fired from even smaller research firms that he used to work for e.g. Vertical and Axiom groups in 2018/2019. * Just google 'Gordon Johnson tesla' and watch tons of video clips on how this clown has made a fool of himself multiple times in front of media and investors. And also how many others have debunked this loser."
"$1.43B for CSIQ beating by a wide margin what Jinko had in revenue. Canadian used to be way behind Jinko in revenue. CSIQ more than doubled YoY quarterly revenue. Trina, LONGI, JA Solar the same. Jinko is just at the same levels as last year. Something is not going well with Jinko. I'm getting very nervous about my retirement baby..... Why are they not able to grow revenue like everyone else is when they were #1 module supplier just a year ago for a number of years???"
In my opinion in 2025 will be $200 company
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jinkosolar-awarded-top-brand-pv-014300136.html
Next year at this time $100
$46 today
$60 expected before good earnings (9/15 after hours) and $70 after!
"JinkoSolar shipment into U.S. stopped by customs, says GLJ Research GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson said in an email to clients that his checks have confirmed that one of JinkoSolar's (JKS) shipments into the U.S. was stopped by U.S. customs, requesting proof that the products were not using HeSheng's silicon metal material."
USA does not want product sourced in China!!!
Today rebound?
Picked up a boat load down here today! JKS market cap should be at LEAST 3x.
Manipulation at its best!!
"At $52, up 40% from Aug 19 low of 37.32. That's 40% in two weeks. And down 42% from 64.76 Jul 22 to 37.32. That's what we call volatility :) Whacky stock...."
Much too cheap…it is 70 usd Minimum worth.With a successful ipo it would be close to 100 usd.Green Energy is the great play in China and worldwide.
"Another thing that I didn't like at all about the Q1 report is the way they seemed to do an almost panic driven switch from just module production to selling wafers and cells without any explanation during the quarterly report. They were talking about gaining market share in module sales world-wide the past year, and all of a sudden, they're substantially reducing module production.... So much for gaining more market share in that space."
Sleep today. There will be a higher price tomorrow.
So did big money just bet on Jinko missing earnings and now they are pushing the price down? Odd how a company can beat earnings estimates by 655% and go down. Also odd that every headline attempts to turn such an earnings beat into a bad thing.
Ad at 42.10
"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (""JinkoSolar"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: JKS), one of the largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world, is in the process of applying for an initial public offering (""IPO"") of its principal operating subsidiary, Jinko Solar Co., Ltd. (""Jiangxi Jinko""), on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Sci-Tech innovation board."
A diamond in the rough!
Jinko moves so fast! Two days ago it was 48.18 and today it reach 41.58! Omg
China will be coming for your shares. They are in the process of consolidating everything that is China back under its control. The first step is the public listing of manufacturing that is going to dilute your shares. The next step is calling in their loans in essence bankrupting them and selling the assets to the new shareholders and debt holders.

Are you ready to buy? :)
"I bought in at 46 , what we all need to remember is time in market, NOT timing the market! no panic ...this will be back up , solar is needed."
DO not let these shorts scare you into bankruptcy talk. Look at how many calls have been traded for sept 17 alone....50 55 60 65......thousands. this is going one direction - UP.
I think today is short squeezed day!
"Who thinks we are going back to $60? When? This board is quiet, let's add some life!! JKS to triple digits, baby!"
EBITDA ValuationJune 2021 Value: $60June 2022 Value: $90

"In next few days, JKS will make a big move up. The catalyst is this: 晶科9/30上会"
when is the ipo for star? anyone please?
Shorts sure shut up today  this is going IBD direction….. UP.
I am lowering target from $19 to $9 with very strong sell rating.
May Allah make it 60$
Single digit is coming.
The Chinese stocks are being taken apart. just unbelievable!
"I sold 3000 shares (average 44.35) that bought at 41.75, about 2.6 per share profits. Still hold the shares that bought at 44.55! go JKS"
"All solar companies listed in China are rated on the stock exchange as follows:LONGI SOLAR $ 80 BILLIONTrina Solar $ 15 BillionJASolar $ 15 BillionJINKO Solar is valued only 2.1 billion. We have a lot of catching up to do! In terms of balance, however, they are better positioned. Because they got fresh capital in the Chinese stock exchange. Technologically, we are even better! There is a lot of catching up to do.We will be worth 10 billion in the coming years. So $ 200. We'll be there by the end of 2023 I think."
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/Philip Shen, a solar-industry analyst with Roth Capital Partners, said his discussions with power utilities and other panel buyers indicate that JinkoSolar, based in Shanghai, has been among the hardest-hit manufacturers, with CBP detaining panels capable of generating about 100 megawatts worth of electricity. That’s enough to power about 29,000 homes a year"
"As a US citizen I like the idea of being self sufficient when it comes to transitioning to renewable energy. However, won't this further delay our transition to solar? also, eith Jinko having ties to US already, why are we suffering the largest drop from this news? I'm still long, just asking why."
49 today
"Never know these days with earnings. But I did grab some before close, I do like this company short and long"
https://ir.jinkosolar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jinkosolars-new-7gw-ingotwafer-facility-vietnam-strengthen
I predict Jinko will get back to test around 48.6 to 46.8! That's the point to buy it again.
Back $60 if you look at DQ CSIQ SPWR FSLR....
Sell before bankruptcy !!
who is waiting to buy? :)
The price is reacting to the star market listing. But people don't seem to be talking about the massive energy shortages in China and the EU. That's going to have a positive effect on demand for alternatives.
"JKS short interest has actually been going down the past months, but it's still the second highest percentage of shares outstanding (about 14% just behind RUN) that is shorted. So the shorts are still not giving up on Jinko until they lose a lot more money playing this one up and down...."
by the end of August 50 $
"I don't expect big moves toward $100 anymore until the FY21 results are in (especially a roaring Q4). We may hit $70 before that, but the combination of bad news is just a lovely lever for shorters - imagine - NASDAQ 2% down, Jinko 10% down. NASDAQ 1% up, Jinko 5% up. The fact that with gas, coal, nuclear costs sky rocketing, solar investments are even more attractive than ever, and everything solar manufacturers can produce will be sold, and for more money as well. Their profits should start to rise soon enough to similar levels as LONGI has enjoyed the past couple of years."
"Going out of business, and then bankruptcy with $29 B debt ! Won't be able to pay like Everglade !"
i live on the big island of hawaii and just drove by a big pv operation they're building near me. i noticed boxes with jinko printed on them. decided to investigate for myself. i was thinking made in china panels but it appears the panels are made in florida?
Jks shots to the moon
"I do not know when the day will come, but all of you who have followed JKS for a significant amt of time know that it will go on some random day >$60. And when it goes, it GOES. lol! Long and strong."
I also took profits this morning. Sold a little early actually but a profit is a profit.
"I am guessing that because of the issues with US Customs and Border Patrol, JKS’s guidance for the third quarter does not include any US shipments….which in a normal quarter would be $300 million. That explains q3 revenue guidance not being as strong as expected. But these issues will be resolved in time…"
End of the week $65
This will be bankrupt !! Debt can't be paid off for years to come. $29 B debt is too much.
"AHAHAHAHHAHA How the f is possible? This is a 300$ stock, low market cap, what a barca in. JKS and CSIQ will make me rich in five years"
Let's go Jinko!
"haha, it reached my 50 target ! What should I do?"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/
Market is uneasy these days.Chinese owned JKS is no different. I expect a big beat but where will the stock go...is the big question. Can’t be a better time for Solar to fly
"Hello Benjo, this is the margin call from Robinhood!"
"If people want to know why this stock fluctuates so much just search ""JKS Short Interest"". Shorts opening and closing positions causes the swings. ."
Pick up some shares at 40.2! I am onboard again.
"Their sales-guidance is brutal!! For 2021 Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4: 5GW, 5GW, 5GW and 10-15GW! 45 GW for next year. Wow!!!"
"The Doom Player steal the show today because he made $57000 in an hour Haha if you believe it! Well, I don't have this kind of luck as he did. But I bought 2000 shares at 46 and sold at 48. I am happy enough. Because I just a normal humans."

"ok around you. The world is literally melting,. Calls for reduced carbon emissions. Whether you believe the bs or not the reaction of the people is real. Governments are going to push renewables hard. JKS has the most growth potential, the others often quoted as doing better have already reached their ceilings. It's the smaller players that will benefit from this the most."
The only time I have seen a severe free fall like this when company completely have missed their earnings.

"Jinko has set up this year's sales in such a way that the Q4 estimates will be out early December where they are going to significantly increase both module sales, revenue and hopefully profit margin. This is a critical chess move to maximize the valuation of Jinko shares in the US, so that the IPO price in Shanghai can be set as high as possible. If the timing between meeting requirements on STAR SSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange), registration process, IPO price setting by SSE and first day of trading is similar to Daqo’s, then for Jinko this would be late Sept 21, early January 22, late January 22, and mid-February 22, respectively. The key is that between Q4 estimates in December and price setting of IPO shares late January, the US investment big shots respond to their Q4 results and move this stock past $100. Otherwise, we longs are going to be diluted by a lot more than we should be if the market were even remotely logical with JKS stock. Jinko has done everything possible to make themselves and US shareholders get rich with their stock."
Now today looked like pure steady market manipulation all day long.

"I am currently long JKS, but I have a question for chartists or others that may have more experience than me. Does anyone believe the gap of $31.92 from May 19th will get filled? I understand gaps do fill about 90% of the time, but could this be one of the 10% of the times it does not. Sincere question. I love the company and have been long for quite some time. Just wanted others opinions."
