"Chart is looking explosive mates, broke through all resistances easily! Soon new all time highs and then leaving double digits forever!!"
Volume on up around 1.2 MM volume on down 0.2 MM at best. This thing screams breakout so badly
Looks like JKS is the victim of a Zack attack. Total BS.
I am all in guys and will sell near $62 at some pts!Filled Buy 3000 JKS Market 48.045 -- -- 10:58:51 07/27/21
"I honestly dont get this, it went to $60 after earning due to good growth and sales numbers. Then a day later it starts to sell off, down 35% in less than 2 weeks, with any real news other than some political bs that does not change their fundamentals. Really frustrating."

"1.5x average daily volume trade in 23 minutes. It will go way way higher. Also that stock would be primer on shorts hiding true numbers which is criminal liability by the way. But those funds are US and US gov (SEC) hates China so would go without jail time for fund managers, but will go with them losing millions, which is not bad as well."
"Let's JKS drop to $30, we are making amazing jump to $100 from $30.Let's sell together and buy the dip."
Pre-market going UP!
Pre-market 52.47 :)
"JKS short interest has actually been going down the past months, but it's still the second highest percentage of shares outstanding (about 14% just behind RUN) that is shorted. So the shorts are still not giving up on Jinko until they lose a lot more money playing this one up and down...."
"This stock is so strange, it was over $60 only a few weeks ago after a great earning, then it dropped to $38 with no bad news at all, now its popping with no news either. But it deserves to be higher. Congratulations for those who bought in under $40 just less than 2 weeks ago while everyone else were panicking :)"
"$1.43B for CSIQ beating by a wide margin what Jinko had in revenue. Canadian used to be way behind Jinko in revenue. CSIQ more than doubled YoY quarterly revenue. Trina, LONGI, JA Solar the same. Jinko is just at the same levels as last year. Something is not going well with Jinko. I'm getting very nervous about my retirement baby..... Why are they not able to grow revenue like everyone else is when they were #1 module supplier just a year ago for a number of years???"
"JinkoSolar shipment into U.S. stopped by customs, says GLJ Research GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson said in an email to clients that his checks have confirmed that one of JinkoSolar's (JKS) shipments into the U.S. was stopped by U.S. customs, requesting proof that the products were not using HeSheng's silicon metal material."
"FSR CSIQ and SPWR are all up, time to add JKS! IMO"
"Shorts are in panic covering mode now, do not sell your shares to them!"
look a book value of 220 something strange what holds down this sp.
"The Doom Player steal the show today because he made $57000 in an hour Haha if you believe it! Well, I don't have this kind of luck as he did. But I bought 2000 shares at 46 and sold at 48. I am happy enough. Because I just a normal humans."
"Incredibly strong rebound off the 200 dma today, in strong volume. This stock is going up - may exceed old high by the end of the year."
Once more into the breach 
US shareholders own ZERO of the company. The ADS shares of Chinese companies are structured that way that they do NOT own any part of the company. So if Junko or Daqo decides to pull out of the US stock market they can do that with US shareholders getting ZERO. There is a great article about that on WSJ. I suggest you guys read it.
"Athn just agreed to SPAC merger with solar company Heliogen. At a 2B valuation for a company just getting started with a mirror technology for generating electricity. ok.Here we have one of the largest battle tested solar panel companies in the world ramping and on the verge of hitting a huge sweet spot between endless demand and regulatory incentives globally.What is our MC again? This could go to 200 in a week and still be undervalued…. Yeah I know Chinese company, yadda yadda. Tell that to yourself when it hits 500 with plenty of room to grow in a few years."
Bankruptcy fears are rising again !! I would avoid this !!
Thanks for the drop and I am buying now!
GREEN is possible here guys!
Now...Oversold
There is a massive EXODUS of western money from Chinese stocks... JKS fair value is $25/sh... heading there...
"The shorts are at it again….having lost money in the last two months, they are now averaging up.Bad move because Jinko’s gross margin has bottomed and will start going up from here….earnings explosion to follow with 2022 earnings in excess of $6.00."
JKS shorts squeezed!
So happy That I hold my 6.000 Shares for the rebound. On Friday I Sold with the First Dip and Last two days i just hold and ein. Love Jinko
"The most obvious reason to push this stock price down is to make a killing in China. Anyone who doesn't catch on to this, must be blind or naive. Daqo has proven that the Shanghai IPO's fetch a massive premium, and that in China, these companies get valued as their peers do (Trina, JA Solar, Tongwei, Xinte, etc.) By pushing the price as low as possible, any hedge fund (could be Morgan Stanley, too, since the STAR IPO is not only available to Chinese investors) that can get in on that IPO can buy up an ever larger percentage of Jinko for practically nothing, and make a fortune the first day this baby trades in STAR. As I already posted, if the Jinko price can be kept around $40-50, they'll have to sell 25% or more to get the $1B capital they are looking to get, leaving us US longs with less than 50% of the company, but without any gurantees that arbitraging will happen. (It's certainly not happening for DQ....) I'm ever more convinced of the fact that there are powerful hedge funds behind this to walk away with billions in a few months. A no brainer...."
getting ready to buy !!!!! just has to dip a little more 
Buy buy buy
"The DQ subsidiary IPO is amazing - 180% up in one day. The US ADR's should closely follow suit, but will they? It'll be the most exciting day today for JKS long holders to see how the US investors react to this IPO. If they don't move the DQ price up to a similar level, the subsidiary could potentially buy out the parent company and say goodbye to the western markets forever."
"Company just announced details of the IPO filing….no surprises. They want to raise around $800 million to $1 billion and the number of shares they have to sell will obviously depend on the stock price.Currently, JKS trades at one-third the EBITDA multiple of its peers in China…. So if we equalize the EBITDA multiple, the stock should be at $120 and they will need to sell only the equivalent of 8 million ADSs to raise their target of a billion."
Shorts got squeeze
when is the ipo for star? anyone please?
JKS business is in a growing market. JKS is the market leader in it.Around 20 % market share.The growth rate for the next five years will be around 20-25 % yearly worldwide.JKS will participate at least on this level from sales point of view.JKS produce the solar panel with the highest efficiency in the market.There are several panels with a higher efficiency but only under laboratory conditions.Mass production of these panels is years away. Simply too expensive.JKS will be the market leader for many more years.Here in Germany the share of green electrical energy production is around 50 % in 2020.Mainly solar and wind energy. Other countries have to follow to reduce CO2 production.Expected 2021 EPS = around 6 $Expected 2022 EPS = around 7.5 - 8 $Fair P/E 2021 is 15-20. That means 90 - 120 $ share priceFair P/E 2022 is 15-20. That means 110 - 160 $ share price.Basically a still perfect buying oportunity.But there is only one thing to consider...It's a Chinese company...The daily action in stock volume is not normal.
WOW! The open interest of calls for sept 17 for 45 50 55 60 65 70 is in the THOUSANDS! The big money shorts will need to cover and load up on calls and shares.IMO this could easily go to beyond 65-70 with excellent earnings…Your thoughts???(Good morning )
JUNKo has 20 BILLION in DEBT... and rising 20-30% a year with interest expense to service that mountain of debt SKYROCKETING... Bankruptcy is 100% GUARANTEED!!!!!
"bought last year at 60, felt some pain. but hey im up now."
"Long hold , not selling single share till 90$"
"As a US citizen I like the idea of being self sufficient when it comes to transitioning to renewable energy. However, won't this further delay our transition to solar? also, eith Jinko having ties to US already, why are we suffering the largest drop from this news? I'm still long, just asking why."
just bought 2500 shares JKS since homebuilders' stocks are up nicely on good earnings: Check NAIL LEN DHI TOL NVR guys!
This is going to file bankruptcy in US.
JKS and DQ are the best Chinese stocks !!!
What is the reason for this UP move? What are the news?
Don't sell ! This is going higher
Crazy jinko
time to take those shorties for a little trip to the moon! :-p
JKS already manufactures in the USA so it appears there would be more scrutiny as to where they are getting their materials from. And all other USA solar companies as well…. What a mess!! I’m long solar but tired of the ups and downs!!
Go DQ! Hopefully JKS to follow like that soon!!!
I’m looking forward to shorts getting absolutely fried when these earnings are great on the 15th
"crazy how it got bought up to $55.99 and then big sellers came in! Just hold your shares...you will be glad :). No reason why this is not >$70....i mean it is one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world, now has partnership for storing energy...and have you seen in how many countries JKS SELLS???? this is worth much more than a $2B market cap.....geesh there are companies with much higher valuations that do not have nearly as much potential and do not have nearly the revenue or profit (will be much more once jinko can get expenses down)!"
3 days as a result red. it's time for a green day again.
Pick up some shares at 40.2! I am onboard again.
"MASSIVE DISASTER... Year over year revenues FELL 6.2%, while year over year EPS FELL 10.2%... JUNKO has NEGATIVE GROWTH... they produce more and sell LESS IN REVENUES & PROFITS... while the MASSIVE DEBT IS SKYROCKETING.... 20 BILLION IN DEBT NOW.... Interest expense is SKYROCKETING... Junko bankrupt in 2023..."
"We just finished a HUGE 2 year project up in the Midwest. Consisting of OVER 750,000 Solar Panels. I might start a position in JKS."
"this is one of those Yo-Yo stocks. Over the past year, it would have been profitable to buy in the 40s and sell at 60 and repeat."
"What silence in August. Has given me time to do more research, and I was surprised that I hadn't noticed that Jinko's growth rate YoY Q1 20 to 21 was zero while Trina, JA Solar, LONGI, and Risen have had outstanding growth rates. The same is true for quarter over quarter growths for the whole past year. I'm starting to get nervous about Jinko's ability to compete with the Chinese traded players that have much better access to capital due to their far higher market valuations than Jinko has in the US. The US has managed to really throttle Jinko to the brink of bankruptcy where I'm wondering if they will survive 5 years down the road.... The STAR listing may be coming too little too late.... Hopefully I'm not really seeing the next Yingli or Suntech Power in the making...."
Buy buy buy before it jumps next week!
be careful with solar stocks under Obama most all went bankrupt in site of push for renewables
Goldman and Sachs price target is a joke lmao. There reasoning….. they have high short positions. Not scaring me away. Holding long and strong
"Short volume yesterday again about 22% on about triple average overall volume. They're not giving up anytime soon. So it'll continue to be a rollercoaster ride unless big players start pushing (like Blackrock, etc.)"
The great news just keeps rolling in.... New module efficiency record 23.5%.... When will the market finally reward this outstanding company?
"Careful when shorts take up almost 3X of average daily volume figure, especially at over bought area. This is JKS, not John Deere. Accumulated blocks at $41.88 this morning."
"Jonko is a great leader company in solar technolgy and was rewarded very often for their technical leadership.The fair valu is at about 75 USD.Hope this #$%$ will be over soon.At this level a strong buy, so my personal opinion. Clima aspects will let the solar business massivly within next years."
"Their sales-guidance is brutal!! For 2021 Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4: 5GW, 5GW, 5GW and 10-15GW! 45 GW for next year. Wow!!!"
"""JinkoSolar's long-term commitment to R&D has enabled it to continue to launch industry leading products. We have also completed the construction of a high-efficiency laminated perovskite cell technology platform that is expected to reach a breakthrough cell conversion efficiency of over 30% within the year. We will continue to innovate and develop solar-plus solutions and promote technical and process improvements to further increase our product competitiveness."""
"Jinko’s listing on the STAR market is likely to happen in the next few months, earlier than the 2022 that was previously expected. The valuation is also likely to be 50% to 100% higher than the valuation in the US market. This will allow them to raise larger amounts of capital at much lower cost and even pay down some debt. This would be the mecahnism by which the price and valuation gap between US and Chonese markets will narrow."
Pre - market 52.50 ;)
What do you think there will be a short squeeze?And how long could it still take to get there?
I took my 3 points per share profits and walk away. It's $7500 profits in two hour. Thanks JKS!
Imagine teaching 69. Break even on this 
Jks ups ups and only ups!
"Zacks can't stop telling the world it's opinion on Jinko - Strong Sell, as if by repeating it often enough in a week, they can make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. I don't trust Zacks one bit in any of their analysis. Lots of smoke and mirrors, and no realistic look at fundamentals."
"$60 again will be nice!!! All Chinese stocks (BIDU BABA JD DQ JKS NIO XPEV, etc.) are up as well...GLTA!"
Have you seen it. Please like.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9o3lq/dd_jinkosolar_10x_giant_in_the_making/
Doomplayer clearly a 
I don’t see how any company has revenue of nearly 5B and their market cap is 2.2B.
Shorts got squeezed!
"Who thinks we are going back to $60? When? This board is quiet, let's add some life!! JKS to triple digits, baby!"
If you pull up the 1 yr chart a similar short squeeze happened and the pps went to $90.If nobody sells they will be forced to buy alot higher
"Jks is much too cheap, a bargain with Abigail leverage of pv business.And it is clear to everyone, that this business has a great future and Jinko is one the leader in this market.The leverage is huge with respect to jks revenues. A small up in margin will boost jks earnings MASSIVLY.Hence the pe is cheap.My opinion.I totally agree:Valuation: Recently the stock price of Chinese module makers - Longi Green, JA Solar and Trina Solar have rallied strongly by 50% to 75%. So Jinko Solar stock has not closed the valuation gap at all with the recent move from $30 to $52.Based on current peer valuations, Jinko’s stock price should be $125 to $150….There is a lot more upside in this story once it gets out of the control of the bearish analysts/investors who, IMHO, don’t understand how the module industry has changed forever!!!This is now an oligopoly! Module makers are restricting production to boost prices. Never happened before!!"
"Awesome news!!!! Based on their numbers, 2.67Billion STAR market shares to generate about $923M cash (using 6.5 RMB/$) implies a share price of only $0.35 - that is, they're going after retail investors who may storm into this stock like Mongolian hordes invading Europe. Short sellers - your days are numbered!"
"Yup, also confirmed in the PPT slide deck graphic. They had 31 GW capacity at end of June, and if they get close to the 30GW high-end prediction (I consider that unlikely, but would be very happy with 28 GW), it would be a fairly decent utilization rate compared to the industry average. Even if the added no further capacity in 2022, it would imply that Jinko could be selling close to about $10B worth of products by the end of 2022. For how much longer can the shorts keep them at around the ridiculous $2B market cap?"
Up please...!!!
Why then CSIQ does not go up?
"Xi initiative and international boycott will puch this to Single digit, if not bankruptcy !!"
Market cap is very low on this regardless of what Zacks thinks
"More than 3x average volume, will pass all times high of $90 this month!"
I feel earnings will be awesome.People are loading up my on panels the world over. A big bump in stock price will help mr jinko fulfill his happy journey
JKS going to $60.
JinkoSolar Holding is up 13.51% to 61.69
"Hello Pat,It´s my pleasure to admit that the timing for your (re) - entry timing has been perfect - again!(Jinkosolar/Wacker deal). Furthermore,it will be interesting to hear the conference call of Daqo - i.e. whether they adress the huge discount of ADR to Daqo Xinjing valuation. As Jinkosolar ""always does ,what the market is doing"" any hint regarding a share swap/redemption of ADRs into China listed shares could stop risky shortselling and trigger appreciation of the share price instead.This would foremost impact Daqo but with a view on Jinkosolar´s STAR market listing raise the speculation of Jinko doing the same.Nevertheless as for this morning I´ll like to send my congratulations to you .Christian"
"My target is 80 USD.This is jinko worth minimum,"
Jks has energy today. All the bears hide away LOL. No more bankruptcy talk!
JKS shots to the moon!
"forgive me, I don't have much experience reading earnings reports.. Did JKS turn profitable during a global pandemic AND sign multiple deals to hedge geopolitical targeting? This stock plays with my emotions daily, just looking for reassurance to keep holding."
Must own JKS DQ BABA BIDU for life guys!
SAVA is OVERSOLD - FYI
"I wrote this in 'Seeking Alpha' a week ago and no one read it'This could be a blessing in disguise for Jinko. Jinko is the only major Chinese solar company having manufacturing capabilities in US (Jacksonville, Florida). This could be Jinko's way to alleviate the tariff and WRO'It is the reason why Jinko went up todayhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3731704-jinkosolar-climbs-on-long-term-supply-deal-with-wacker-chemie"
Nice move. I never added more when it dropped but I am getting closer to break even (after being up like 20% and watching my gains disappear.... ).
"""What we might be seeing is the market reverse its thinking on solar import restrictions. Instead of a headwind, like it might seem to be for JinkoSolar, it could be a tailwind because of the company's U.S. presence."" Golf clap to this author for trying to apply logic to JKS. Daqo outshined everyone today with no ties to the US that I'm aware of."
Nice job everyone who bought and did not sell...they will probably try to bring it down again a bit....I am not selling mine....NOPE....60 minimum. This stock price should be triple digits.
"At $52, up 40% from Aug 19 low of 37.32. That's 40% in two weeks. And down 42% from 64.76 Jul 22 to 37.32. That's what we call volatility :) Whacky stock...."
USA does not want product sourced in China!!!

Squeezing time? To The Moon~~!!
So Zacks & Goldman aren't so powerful after all???
"Jinko has annouced that has started the application to be listed on the STAR (Shanghai) stock exchange by IPO. Does any one of you have any past experiences how this may result into the price action in the US? I know a priori it is not directly affected, they will just be listed separately and raised further capital, but how the stock price in the US will be affected in the mid term?"
This is gonna break out tomorrow morning 8% mark this call
this is 70 USD stock ..... you have to stay calm.The shorties have to buy and this will accelerate the up in the stock price to new hoghs.Fundamtentally a STRING BUY !
I like how shorts post FUD on Yahoo finance as if this is what will swing the price down. We're out here buying a few hundred shares lol.
"Is this true that JINKO will be removed from US market? I heard that, and now people selling this. Often Chinese news are not told in English."
$60 this week baby!!!!!!!!
Still way undervalued

"No any good news, it's short covering. I don't suggest short selling. It's kind of dangerous."
"It would be even more epic next time short squeeze happens, just be patient, have fun with short."
"The volatility in JKS is just nuts! I have been in an out and in and out....honestly think holding for the long term is the way to go so I do not miss out on a 100%, 200% jump...when this goes.....this goes!"
"If people want to know why this stock fluctuates so much just search ""JKS Short Interest"". Shorts opening and closing positions causes the swings. ."
"As I said, this is a trading stock. No big dream!"
"To prove my point, the average JKS daily volume has already been reached in a little over half an hour. The shorts are going frantic. Like last October, where short volumes partially reached 40% or more, we're going to see this again and again, until JKS finally gets the STAR boost."
$60 today???
Manipulation at its best!!
This kind of stupid trading for JKS were happening so many times. Wall Street doesn't care how good of the earning. They just attacked it. use any excuses to sell it. Because this is a Chinese Solar company.
every day ... we always go down ... why?
I couldn't believe my eyes today and have been waiting all day for a correction from 45GW to 35GW module capacity.... What an amazing change from last quarter if that number is really true!
"I bought in at 46 , what we all need to remember is time in market, NOT timing the market! no panic ...this will be back up , solar is needed."
"I do not know when the day will come, but all of you who have followed JKS for a significant amt of time know that it will go on some random day >$60. And when it goes, it GOES. lol! Long and strong."
"very choppy today, but hopefully we will end above $50 today."
I think it is exaggerated

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/
this stock is about to make me another 50k east over the next month. I'll do you a favor. invest anywhere between 35 and 45 and sell anywhere between 55-65 . prepare to hold long term. average down when appropriate . done it 3 times already $JKS isn't going anywhere. and definitely isn't going bankrupt  LFG 
Nope! Check value!!
5 points on 500 shares. Out
Last year this time it was $90.... a year later is at $45... next year will be at $22.5.... market it down...
"Canadian Solar’s results have very positive implications for JKS…. Gross margins are likely to be much better than guidance AGAIN: pricing is moving up for modules, cost increases are stabilizing and these trends are going to be repeated in the third quarter.My guess is JKS will do better than 17% gross margin in q2 and q3 will be 18% to 20%! That’s much better than what perennially bearish (and wrong!) Wall Street analysts are saying right now."
Today a Zacks article about the Maersk deal has JKS a HOLD. Isn't that funny how fast they went from Strong Sell to Hold?
Short volume yesterday and Friday have remained steady at about 21%. The shorts are not anywhere near from giving up with this stock. They have become way too addicted to being able to play Jinko up and down over the past many years. Only if they have to swallow massive losses will they finally give up on this one. The short volume for this kind of company in a normal world wouldn't be anywhere more than 3-5% given the massive growth prospects they have.
2nd wave. RSI has been rest. Watch volume candles.
Shorts got squeeze!
BIG SHORT SQUEEZE ON Chinese stocks like BABA BIDU JD JKS DQ DIDI NIO XPEV LI and BA!
Oh what's going on Zacks ... ? why this sector is falling down ?
Need to read my post from main to bottom of replies upwards :) (If parts don't get blocked again for the 6th time.... :(
Is that market cap on yahoo finance accurate?
"Sold mines at 63 premarket… 60s is pretty much the high end. Last 3 times it hit 60s, it fell back to mid 50s"

A diamond in the rough!
"Serious question - anyone here considers de-listing a possibility?I personally don't as it would limit company from getting source of funding in case it needs it.Yes, short cnts are using US listing as shorting stock but nonetheless when STAR comes in it makes sense to keep both up as US side would inevitable arbitrage to local (or get quite close).THing is - I am long 2023 options on Jinko and if it gets delisted it turns NULL, if it stays on, then I am loading more. Just thinking out loud, would be good to hear your views gents."
Picked up a boat load down here today! JKS market cap should be at LEAST 3x.
Jks ups ups and only ups from here!
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Manipulation of China stocks is going on
This is really HUGE! Avg. Volume nearly reached in the first trading hour!! Next is triple digits!!!
"Shorts have gone from 200k shares to 600k shares in the last day... and we still went up 3%! This is normally the most they'll sell short. If we hold, the stock will swing up 5-10% in the next four days as they cover."
Shorts sure shut up today  this is going IBD direction….. UP.
"Focusing on the fourth quarter results, relative to consensus expectations, shipments and revenues were better and gross margin was also higher. So why are the results disappointing if you remove all the one time write-offs of obsolescence in plant and equipment and impairment in value of a solar project (which added $50 million to operating costs), and you eliminate all the “mark to market” noise created by the change in value of derivatives surrounding the convertible debt, then the item that stocks out like a very sore thumb in costs is SHIPPING. Yes the cost of shipping has more than doubled in the last few months and they were not able to pass it to their customers, perhaps for contractual reasons.But again, this is a short to medium term phenomenon, a legacy of the disruption caused by the pandemic."
"ok around you. The world is literally melting,. Calls for reduced carbon emissions. Whether you believe the bs or not the reaction of the people is real. Governments are going to push renewables hard. JKS has the most growth potential, the others often quoted as doing better have already reached their ceilings. It's the smaller players that will benefit from this the most."
$60 expected before good earnings (9/15 after hours) and $70 after!
"EXPECT DOWNGRADES AHEAD: For the third quarter of 2021, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.24 billion to $1.37 billion vs. consensus of $1.60B. Gross margin for the third quarter is expected to be between 12% and 15% vs consensus 18%."
Lucky for me like NIO. I love this so much. Not going to sell in double digits.
$56-$58 before earings (9/15) - Earnings should be excellent!
Destroyed the stock price today!

"AHAHAHAHHAHA How the f is possible? This is a 300$ stock, low market cap, what a barca in. JKS and CSIQ will make me rich in five years"
DO not let these shorts scare you into bankruptcy talk. Look at how many calls have been traded for sept 17 alone....50 55 60 65......thousands. this is going one direction - UP.
"JKS blows out earnings, it ups ups and only ups from here, buy all you can!"
When the shorts cover and this shoots up 13% in a day you'll wish you bought more.
Why going down also today?
Has anyone wondered whom Jinko sold the 792 MW cells & wafers to the first quarter and whom they continue to sell wafers and cells to? Jinko is now #4 vendor of modules for H1/21 after being number 1 for 2016-2019 and 2nd last year. So they are willing to forgo maintaining their output lead in order to reign in potential losses? Wouldn't it be ironic if Jinko sold some of those wafers/cells to Trina or JA Solar?
Bankruptcy fears are alive and well. No one can pay down $28 B debt.
"wow +$7 and up, where is zacks?"
CSIQ is now GREEN!
Haha. Put your seatbelts on! 
"Special interest/Hedge fund henchman Gordon Johnson of GLJ research lowered the firm's price target on JinkoSolar to $10.70 from $12.94 and keeps a Sell rating on the shares following yesterday's Q2 results. Who is this guy?GLJ Research (Gordon Johnson):* A twisted mind with ulterior motives e.g. he pretends to cover 'Alt Energy' but ends up giving SELL rating top practically every company (72% Sells including calls for TSLA to go bankrupt since the demand for their cars is collapsing!)* A classic FUD proponent who is amongst the worst of the worst in terms of track record, Ranked #7,365 out of 7,641 Analysts on TipRanks (#15,268 out of 15,783 overall experts) with a average return of NEGATIVE 7% ... he is actually be a good contrarian play!* He is delusion about his own competence, which he only maintains by lying to himself. No big research firms would hire him - but infact he was fired from even smaller research firms that he used to work for e.g. Vertical and Axiom groups in 2018/2019. * Just google 'Gordon Johnson tesla' and watch tons of video clips on how this clown has made a fool of himself multiple times in front of media and investors. And also how many others have debunked this loser."
I bought 20 calls last week guys !JKS Sep 17 2021 55 CallGo JKS DQ BABA NVAX FUBO.....
So I hope to buy a few more at a lower price. I might have to hold for while until sanity returns.
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/Philip Shen, a solar-industry analyst with Roth Capital Partners, said his discussions with power utilities and other panel buyers indicate that JinkoSolar, based in Shanghai, has been among the hardest-hit manufacturers, with CBP detaining panels capable of generating about 100 megawatts worth of electricity. That’s enough to power about 29,000 homes a year"
Listing on STAR Market soon! Let´s go to new all time high´s and triple digits now!!
Glad I sold at 63. If this goes back up to low 60s… take profits
"I am guessing that because of the issues with US Customs and Border Patrol, JKS’s guidance for the third quarter does not include any US shipments….which in a normal quarter would be $300 million. That explains q3 revenue guidance not being as strong as expected. But these issues will be resolved in time…"
"It says there's a pretty massive amount of shorts (1.7mil shares or 36%) which could cause a potential further squeeze. Lots of good news out at the moment with the listing, infrastructure deal and I've heard easing up from USA administration. Squeeze territory."
"Jinkosolar is a totally undervalued stock!Here are the facts:Jinkosolar is the world leader (number one in China, Middle East, Australia and Europe and number 2/3 in the US) in the solar module business. Furthermore, this company is also technology leader for monocrysaline PV modules. It was the first vertical integrated PV module producer in the world, which covers the whole process (wafer, cells, modules). Adding to this, the company is massivley expanding its business into new areas (they are one of the biggest solar project companies, e.g. they finalized currently the 1 billion US$ project in VAE in conneciton with EDF, which will lead to the sale of 4 Million modules in 2021) and into the battery energy storage. They started to sell it in December!). As China, Europe etc. are moving to renewables as well as the situation that more and more countries reach grid parity, the company still invests massivley into the expansion of the production facilites to cover the demand, which will lead to massiv growth in the near future. Furthermore, the massiv push of countries into the hydrogen economy will also lead to growth of the solar sector. The only useful hydrogen production will be ""green hydrogen"" produced by solar or wind. Adding to this, the PV producer market has already gone through a major consolidation. While companies like Sunedision, Solarworld or Q-Cells went bancrupt, the five biggest PV producer of the world already have a marketshare of around 70%. They will dominate the ASPs in the near future, which will be beneficial for the margins.This company is only 15 years old, but will make already 5 billion revenues in 2020 and grows by around 20% at the moment. They earn money; Ebitda positiv by around 700-750 million in 2020 and 150 mill net (before currency valuations). Even as the margins came under pressure due to some raw material shortages....this will be over in the coming months, as new solar glass and polysilicon facilities come online (refer to CEO of Daqo and Trina Solar). The stock valuation of Jinkosolar is ridicolous compared to hydrogen companies or some solar companies, like Sunpower (which will miss the future, except TOTAL will fully buy it!) or First Solar. If you would compare it to a PLUG POWER, Jinko should be traded by around 1.500 US$, while if you would take First Solar (which is smaller than Jinkosolar) into account, the company should be valued by around 250 US$.The stock increase of 120% in 2020 was ok, but I really look forward to 2021, especially since the IPO of the project daughter will also lead to an increase of the valuation. This company is already valued in the ""road show"" process by around 4 billion US$, which would be more of the 3 billion, which Jinko is traded at the moment. Totally long and bullish!"
what is all this bankruptcy talk anyway???
"World marketleader in PV …the valuation should be much better, the future for PV is bright and margin will rise.With Jinko revenues the profits will explode in that moment.Fair value is about 75 usd."
Jks ups ups and only ups from here.
"I don't think JKS moved down based on Zacks. Looking at the FSLR chart, it looks almost identical to JKS. On the 233 both have price, stoch RSI, MACD, and ADX/DMI all crossing down at about the same time. Also both stocks hit the upper bollinger band, spread the band, then crossed down. Very bearish indicators. The daily looks like it may cross down tomorrow. I'd be a buyer of Puts at this time."
So did big money just bet on Jinko missing earnings and now they are pushing the price down? Odd how a company can beat earnings estimates by 655% and go down. Also odd that every headline attempts to turn such an earnings beat into a bad thing.
This is the future
Seems like someone is pushing a false narrative hard
JKS and DIDI are my best Chinese stocks beside NIO XPEV LI BLNK!
The 9 Best Drone Stocks To Buy Right Now - For details https://youtu.be/hOG8BADkv5U
No resistance till the low 60's. Nearly sold my position a short while ago. I guess management is pretty smart to hold the course steady during tough times. During the second half we should get back to the mid 80;s or 90's even.
"DQ is now trading in China and the stock was up a staggering 184% on the opening day of trading yesterday. Based on the 16% sold in the IPO, the company is now valued at $18 Billion in China. That compares with a valuation of $6.3 billion based on stock that trades in the US.In other words the US stock about one-third the value of the Chinese stock. This valuation disparity will end because arbitrageurs will find a way!"
Today rebound?
JinkoSolar Holding is up 12.73% to 50.11
Thanks to (http://trademarketview.tech) I have saved hours of research for stock picks. Their daily watchlists help me make the most of my trades each day!
profitable? check. So lets go...
"Short interest is over 9 million shares at the last record date of June 15, well above the 7.2 million reported for May 31. Chances are that short interest is even higher as of June 30."

"Jiangxi Jinko is the revenue generating part of JKS, and its listing in STAR market cost the Jinko shareholders an almost 50% dilution."
I have seen it crashing before too and then it resurrects itself like a phoenix! Its fundamentals are solid. I sold juicy Puts today.
Chinese stocks are green today only NIO XPEV LI BLNK while JKS BABA BIDU DIDI JD are red
"Valuation: Recently the stock price of Chinese module makers - Longi Green, JA Solar and Trina Solar have rallied strongly by 50% to 75%. So Jinko Solar stock has not closed the valuation gap at all with the recent move from $30 to $52.Based on current peer valuations, Jinko’s stock price should be $125 to $150….There is a lot more upside in this story once it gets out of the control of the bearish analysts/investors who, IMHO, don’t understand how the module industry has changed forever!!!This is now an oligopoly! Module makers are restricting production to boost prices. Never happened before!!"
I am lowering target from $19 to $9 with very strong sell rating.
I could not believe it that I bought JKS at awesome price today - 2K shares!
Should I sell bought it @ 52.90 (2 days ago)
OLIGOPOLY!!!! Jinko’s market share in modules is greater than Saudi Arabia’s in oil!
"It sure didn’t want to, but We broke $51 for about 30 seconds, haha! Huge resistance at 51. Wait until that wall gets brought down….. when it does, see you at $60!"
"JUST IN: JUNKo DOWNGRADED TO STRONG SELL, TARGET SLASHED TO $30"

Market is uneasy these days.Chinese owned JKS is no different. I expect a big beat but where will the stock go...is the big question. Can’t be a better time for Solar to fly

"Days like these, one needs some good news. Blackrock, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley and other big players have been loading up on Jinko. That's probably what helped us longs get out of that hole at $29.... Enjoy the weekend!"
i live on the big island of hawaii and just drove by a big pv operation they're building near me. i noticed boxes with jinko printed on them. decided to investigate for myself. i was thinking made in china panels but it appears the panels are made in florida?
The only time I have seen a severe free fall like this when company completely have missed their earnings.
shorts squeezed
I’ve owed jinko for awhile now . Jinko bells Jinko bells and all that. I have to admit with this stock being Chinese owned it’s alittle but suspect. I’m not a hundred percent satisfied with this stock. Someone is pulling the strings on the largest producer.....
Look at what's happening to DQ last day before IPO offering. I know Jinko's is pretty far down the road but good sign.
"Can anyone explain please, who is driving this ""saw"" (up/down)?"
Just joined in this today. Thanks for picking me up before moon.
time to load ! round 4  100k at 38
"Enph er looked good, I just don't know why it is tanking ah?"
"This strategic deal with Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company, is very important. Shipping costs are almost 6% of sales…. That is a very high number in any industry, more so for solar modules where gross margins have been pretty low to begin with….But the big story that is going to take the stock to $100 plus this year and over $500 in the next few years will be MARGIN improvement. Long term gross margins are heading up because industry is consolidating, technology transitions are more difficult and more capital intensive and the value proposition is already compelling versus fossil fuels.Reducing shipping costs as a percentage of sales is one more way to improve margins."
"Some excellent news again with longterm agreement with Wacker. Just like Jinko did with Xinte (sourcing polysilicion in Mongolia instead of Xinjiang), they are now going to source a significant amount of polysilicon from US/German plants which will (theoretically) allow them to manufacture safely for US/European markets free of tariffs and supply chain woes."
pre market manipulation!I'm not worried at all this will go alot higher. !!!
What do you think about when the second listing will take place?
10% down for what? This action is just disgusting.
"How to raise the share price?The problem:Market capitalisation in USD:Longi: 65bnTongwei: 25bnJaSolar: 12bnTrina Solar: 8bnJinkosolar: 2bn The fastest and most efficient solution is laid out in the mail below to JKS Investors Relation.If you want to move the stock upwards you should send an mail to JKS instead of writing here...Dear Sir or Madam, JinkoSolar has a persisting low market valuation compared to its china listed peer group. This makes the company potentially vulnerable and poses an unnecessary threat to success. JinkoSolar announced to list Jiangxi Jinko at China STAR market to get better access to capital markets after enduring the complex listing procedure. Not the missing China listing is what is standing in the way to raise the Mcap, it is more the fact to be listed on NASDAQ where Chinese solar stocks have traditionally a detrimental existence. As long as the US are responsible for the fate of the share price of JKS there won´t be a sustainable base. JinkoSolar is listed in Germany as well and has a very enthusiastic supportive community which provides a trade volume of several hundred thousand shares on good days, more than enough given the actual free float. The daily trading of JKS stock always follows the same pattern which shows a positive trend until the US market opens the gates to the casino. Unfortunately there seems to be a long road until a china listing of the daughter company could provide some support for the JKS stock on NASDAQ - possibly. JKS´s Capex guidance for this year raises the question of an overloaden debt burden which itself suppresses the stock price and would lead to a very dilutive stock placement if necessary. This is a risk which a highly valued company (i.e. Longi) doesn´t have at all. The lack of this risk alone works like a bulletproof backstop for a plunging share price. JKS is currently in the opposite situation and exposed to any kind of price speculation. A hypothetical raise of 500mn USD capital by equity would mean in case of Longi an indiscernible dilution of less than 1%. To get the same amount of money, JKS had to issue additional 30% of its outstanding stock! This is a misfortune which can´t be compensated elsewhere. Therefore I would like to give you the advice to simply delist JKS from NASDAQ trading. This is no detrimental point for the company´s image. There are no big hurdles which would take time to realize this move. Any ADRs can easily be traded in Germany as well as in the US. The German TRADEGATE exchange is opened until the usual US closing. There is no timely extensive procedure of requirements to overcome. There is no costly redemption or conversion in the forefront. Even US customers of JKS´s solar products will certainly prefer a sound, well financed company which can offer competitive priced products instead of a company that sacrifices its edge to the notorious mispriced valuation on NASDAQ. When the announcement of this liberating shift is communicated reasonably there will rather be a sigh of relief than a meaningful share price dip and the bounce back of the JKS stock which is trading then mainly on TRADEGATE / Germany will be stellar - and based on a far more solid and predictable footing. There are many European green energy companies with far higher valuation thanks to their main listing in Germany. The market is by far big enough for any capital-requiring measures. There are a lot of influential german analysts in the financial media promoting JKS day by day to investors but any up-move to the stock price suffocates when NASDAQ opens. Most JKS investors - even in the US - would highly welcome to get rid of NASDAQ´s continuously bearish impact on ""suspicious"" Chinese stocks. The US bias towards China seems to be far from a turnaround and will further suppress JKS stock price, its company value and its refinancing abilities as long as the US listing keeps to be market making - irrespective of any achievements JKS provides.The fact that a high market capitalization itself accounts for the possible success of a company in today´s markets could be crucial for JKS to stay in the solar worlds´ well financed top tier. With respect to recent market developments in the solar industry as well as in the political environment and especially with respect to the financial markets´ stance to JKS, I would highly appreciate if you consider this remark seriously. I would appreciate your feedback. Kind regards,"
"I am almost back to even on JKS. I have solar panels on my house. They are REC N-Peak panels. Total cost was about $27k for 27-panels installed. Fed gov't paid $8,000, power company paid $6,000. I paid the remaining off in 1-year. My power bills are $26/month vs $250/month average before them. When the power company when with digital meters that are now 99.5% accurate, peoples bills went to $400+/month. The power company required it because the old analog meters were very inaccurate. People are screaming and shifting to solar. They missed out on all the incentives I got, but they don't care now. HOA's in our area are trying to stop the flood. HOA's are not permitted to block installation of solar panels and you don't even need their approval."
"Ripping through 60 and to new highs this week.Was no-brainer all the way with ridiculous valuation.Oh ""muh small net earninings"" without considering 1 quarter revenue was almost comparable to market cap itself! And expenses were temporary in nature (new top notch automated factory build / polysillicon temporary prices up). Also thesis ""b-b-but US is everything and Biden would block REEE"" is wrong, cause world != US and imbeciles from Wall Street shorting this stock will learn hard way."
"The volatility in JKS is mind boggling. I have caught the channel trade a few times and will continue, seems like it just bounces between 40-60 back and forth..."
"If Goldman Sachs says sell, then buy. As simple as that."
pure manipulation!!!
The fundamental is great but short position is very high. This is a great buying opportunity for not only a long term but also for a short term.
Why going down?!?!?!?
"This stock has been so cheap for so long.... if true price discovery is forced by the additional listing 200 is not out of the question. A 10B MC for a premier company in the Solar Industry (yes, that solar industry, the one taking over the world...)? Not outrageous by any means. Practically guaranteed...."
"The short sellers always jump on bad news even if it only very remotely has to do with Jinko (e.g., China says parents should not become poor paying expensive after school hour tutoring companies, therefore Chinese companies suck.... LoL :) ) Like solar has a lot to do with tutoring companies or DIDI not protecting their data better.... But the US hedge funds are always looking for an excuse. In the end, the d0mb a$!es only help Chinese get richer when Jinko executes the secondary listing in Shanghai and then smart Chinese capitalists buy out the parent company for cheap."
"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (JKS) stock skyrocketing in premarket, here’s why? https://goo.io/investorsobserver.com"
"haha, it reached my 50 target ! What should I do?"
Let’s going to $60!
"Hahaha Jinko, my love, you are madness pure!"
Jinkosolar is ahead of its competitors in diversifying the supply chain to avoid getting caught up in the ongoing trade dispute. Its future- forward approach includes signing polysilicon supply deals with Wacker and building up wafer plant in Vietnam.
measiest stock to trade. 50-60 rince and repeat. 4th time now getting this
Now today looked like pure steady market manipulation all day long.
"China is a capitalist dictatorship. They have almost nothing in common with the other ""communist"" countries I've read and heard about. Total wealth in China is rising faster than in most parts of the world. Worldwide total wealth is estimated at about $418 trillion (that's about $418 million million or $60,000 for every man, woman and child in the world on average, which we all know has nothing to do with reality, but oh well. As statistics go.) China is estimated to have about 18% of that total WW wealth and the US about 30%, but China's wealth almost tripled in the past 10 years while the US's doubled. A lot of that wealth is in stocks which could evaporate in a flash theoretically, but that's highly doubtful - neither in the US nor China will people be happy to see a big percentage of their ""wealth"" disappear. $45 trillion of $126 trillion or 36% is the portion of US wealth in NYSE/NASDAQ, while in China, its about $18 trillion of $75 trillion total wealth, or 24%. The days where ""big boys"" in NY or any other place control the value of these internationally linked stock markets are probably history, although they can do some damage to individual companies for a temporary period of time. Weekend musings... Until Monday!"
Finally I sold all the shares above 50. Good luck everyone! As I said no big dream for me. Jinko is my ATM machine.
Sharks smelling blood again: short volume going up from 19 to 24 to 26%
Huge volume!
What is your feelings for tomorrow ?
"Doubled from the bottom, will hang around 60 for a while, then reach 100, 200 and 300"
All solar stocks drop today.
Good news from LEN DHI NAIL TO NVR guys so JKS will be over $60 shortly - IMO
I’d like to thank $CHEK for being my only holding other than $JKS that is significantly in the green today. Me and my aging colon believe in this company.
"Down below 52! These big guys play games and think we are going to fall for it See you at 60, suckazzzz "
This will be bankrupt !! Debt can't be paid off for years to come. $29 B debt is too much.
"Before the Chinese equity offering last year, the holding company owned around 85% of the operating subsidiary. That went down to 73% after the offering. Now, if they sell the maximum amount of shares to raise approximately $1 billion at around $50 per share, we the holders of parent company stock will end up owning around 55%.In that situation, the total enterprise value of the company will be about $4.5 billion of equity and debt net of cash of around $1.5 billion, so a total of $6 billion.For an enterprise value of $10 billion, the stock has to go up an additional $4 billion, ie., essentially double. Even doubling would put it at a price to EBITDA and price to revenues that is at a significant discount to its Chinese peers trading in the Chinese markets."
Experts saying you should get out of all Chinese stocks due to the Chinese regulations coming.
"CFRA is entitled to their opinion about the future no matter how ill-informed. My own analysis suggests the next two years are going to be a period of sustained growth of at least 30% in unit shipments of modules, relatively stable pricing because of limited poly silicon supply and growing concentration of market share, and therefore IMPROVING gross margins which could exceed 20% by 2022. Also JKS is now a vertically integrated module maker which means they capture internally all the margin that goes to the wafer makers.As a result $5.00 in 2021 earnings is conservative, $6.00 is likely and $7.00 is possible.Similarly in 2022, $7.00 is conservative, $8.00 is likely, and $9.00 is possible.As this improving margin and earnings picture unfolds, I think the P/E multiple will expand as well. Stocks like ENPH and DQ have demonstrated that when margins expand, out of favor stocks with low multiples can experience MASSIVE multiple expansion. So a 20X multiple is definitely in JKS’ future."
"Another thing that I didn't like at all about the Q1 report is the way they seemed to do an almost panic driven switch from just module production to selling wafers and cells without any explanation during the quarterly report. They were talking about gaining market share in module sales world-wide the past year, and all of a sudden, they're substantially reducing module production.... So much for gaining more market share in that space."
Can anyone who knows tell me what’s driving this stock down everyday? I think it’s unrelated to the crackdown unless of course investors are just dumping all Chinese stocks.
"funny, every time jinko spikes we hear more unsubstantiated forced labour claims against jinko. No evidence connecting Hoshine, nevermind jinko's supplier Germany's Wacher Chemie. This seems like more of the Gordon Johnson mis-information bs."
forward looking statements weren't so great huh?
