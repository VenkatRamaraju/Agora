"Jinko is aiming to ship over 10 GW in modules in Q4, basically doubling revenues from third quarter to excess of $2.5 billion. Earnings could be well over $1.50 in Q4. Yes the company has disappointed in the first half of this year, but this is not the time to give up."
Where are gurus predicting dip to 40s?
Jinkosolar is ahead of its competitors in diversifying the supply chain to avoid getting caught up in the ongoing trade dispute. Its future- forward approach includes signing polysilicon supply deals with Wacker and building up wafer plant in Vietnam.
"Oct 14 short % of shares outstanding at a record low of 10.4% since I've started seriously watching this stock. That doesn't mean the price will rise a lot fast, but it means that short sellers are getting cautious and prepared for a major price increase the coming months. At least, they're not as willing to bet against them anymore as they used to. This has shown up clearly in a lot lower volatility from what I can see."
The price is reacting to the star market listing. But people don't seem to be talking about the massive energy shortages in China and the EU. That's going to have a positive effect on demand for alternatives.
Yep so ENPH crushed their earnings which is a good sign for all solar companies going forward 
Co´s like JKS will solve China´s energy problem and make the whole world a better place! Bright future ahead for JKS which is on the way to be a disruptive global player in green energy!! Mark this post!!!
who is waiting to buy? :)
"Gap at $47.75 from Oct. 8/Oct. 11. I do not think I will be buying until that fills and I think we could see $44-$45 another time before we go higher. Of course, if there is STAR listing news or another major catalyst, then all bets are off. This is just what I am seeing from the charts. I am bullish long term."
One day the market cap of Jinko Solar will be $10B … you know what it means ….. Long and strong
Jinko preliminary 9 month disclosure through Sept for revenues and net income for the subsidiary does not look like strong earnings. It might even suggest a loss based on the first 2 quarters results. No wonder it is tanking.
I sold 3000 shares that bought at 43.4 to take $2 per share profits. I still have 3000 shares that bought at 44.7!
"Love this stock, and glad I kept buying when it was falling to $36, I hope we will break $60 soon!"
Rotation into solar has begun. Short shares also down under 6 million... enjoy.
$60 here I come!
The insiders have told us that JKS will have good margins going down the road. They didn't buy up 26% of JKS so they could put up over a third of what JKS made by selling stock. JKS is going to be making so much money they never have to sell stock again. JKS is going to go up a lot.
Fourth quarter shipments: the company is expecting to sell at least 10 GW of modules. Important to note that this number is higher than the company’s quarterly production capacity. The company has bought enough raw materials and has been building inventories in Q2 and Q3 to enable potential shipments to be as high as 14 GW - if the demand is there.
"So ""pat"" - Did you sell your $44.55 shares, yet? :)"
Much too cheap…it is 70 usd Minimum worth.With a successful ipo it would be close to 100 usd.Green Energy is the great play in China and worldwide.
Did anyone mention the Jeffries buy rating? On one analyst site I see an 80 dollar target. On another I see the first strong buy recently. We just need the market maker to wake up one day and let the run begin :)
"Today 48+, Monday 50+"
"Sector selling off ahead of US solar earnings, ENPH. People assume they're going to be bad. I think people will be surprised how well Chinese solar does vs US, given massive energy shortages in China and not US. But that's just my thoughts."
The infrastructure is close to going through. All solar stocks will take off like a rocket.
$80 we´re coming!
"Volume should pick up today. Yesterday was the market maker... there was no downside volume. Another plush indicator. Solar right now is cheaper than coal in China and getting cheaper. China has a huge carbon emissions problem and China is where solar happens. Put the 3 together and what does that mean? Also, nobody responded to my Elliot Wave buy indicator. It you don't follow it you should. On a macro perspective it is almost always right. And it forecasts the S&P going to 6000 and then back to 1000. Yes, that is correct... you might want to look at it."
"Volume increasing... this stock has a brighter short term future than any other stock. No negative press anymore, big shorts bailing, hedge funds buying, US climate change policy ramping up, a huge 4th quarter in the works, and the China IPO. As Jim Harbaugh tells his players.... who has it better than us?"
Good news from FSLR guys so JKDS & DQ will be doing well!
$70 is coming!
@Phillip I didn't short Jks and I believe the Solar rally just begun. I learned the lesson not to hold Chinese Solar for long term. I wait the pull back then hit and run few points. I don't mind Jks goes up. I have no big dream for it.
Sleep today. There will be a higher price tomorrow.
haha what manipulation. Let them play their games....the shorts will learn the hard way! Don't mess with JKS baby!
"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (""JinkoSolar"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: JKS), one of the largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world, is in the process of applying for an initial public offering (""IPO"") of its principal operating subsidiary, Jinko Solar Co., Ltd. (""Jiangxi Jinko""), on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Sci-Tech innovation board."
Buy. Buy. Buy.
Trina solar went private at 1.2 billion value few years ago. Today it is trading around 15 billions value in China. It's more than 12 times market cap.
We are a $200 Stock ! Till 2023 we go there. !!JKS $200 = 9 Billion $
"I don't expect big moves toward $100 anymore until the FY21 results are in (especially a roaring Q4). We may hit $70 before that, but the combination of bad news is just a lovely lever for shorters - imagine - NASDAQ 2% down, Jinko 10% down. NASDAQ 1% up, Jinko 5% up. The fact that with gas, coal, nuclear costs sky rocketing, solar investments are even more attractive than ever, and everything solar manufacturers can produce will be sold, and for more money as well. Their profits should start to rise soon enough to similar levels as LONGI has enjoyed the past couple of years."
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
And another world record on solar cell efficiency - 25.4% - WOW Jinko!!! :)
"All solar companies listed in China are rated on the stock exchange as follows:LONGI SOLAR $ 80 BILLIONTrina Solar $ 15 BillionJASolar $ 15 BillionJINKO Solar is valued only 2.1 billion. We have a lot of catching up to do! In terms of balance, however, they are better positioned. Because they got fresh capital in the Chinese stock exchange. Technologically, we are even better! There is a lot of catching up to do.We will be worth 10 billion in the coming years. So $ 200. We'll be there by the end of 2023 I think."
"Trina Solar goes up 4 times after IPO this year in China. When it left Wall Street, it was value at 1.1 billion. Now it is almost 20 billions market cap."
