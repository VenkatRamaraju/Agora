So did big money just bet on Jinko missing earnings and now they are pushing the price down? Odd how a company can beat earnings estimates by 655% and go down. Also odd that every headline attempts to turn such an earnings beat into a bad thing.
I’m looking forward to shorts getting absolutely fried when these earnings are great on the 15th
Are you ready to buy? :)
"It sure didn’t want to, but We broke $51 for about 30 seconds, haha! Huge resistance at 51. Wait until that wall gets brought down….. when it does, see you at $60!"
DO not let these shorts scare you into bankruptcy talk. Look at how many calls have been traded for sept 17 alone....50 55 60 65......thousands. this is going one direction - UP.
Great future
China will be coming for your shares. They are in the process of consolidating everything that is China back under its control. The first step is the public listing of manufacturing that is going to dilute your shares. The next step is calling in their loans in essence bankrupting them and selling the assets to the new shareholders and debt holders.
"Trina Solar goes up 4 times after IPO this year in China. When it left Wall Street, it was value at 1.1 billion. Now it is almost 20 billions market cap."
I took my 3 points per share profits and walk away. It's $7500 profits in two hour. Thanks JKS!
"This stock is so strange, it was over $60 only a few weeks ago after a great earning, then it dropped to $38 with no bad news at all, now its popping with no news either. But it deserves to be higher. Congratulations for those who bought in under $40 just less than 2 weeks ago while everyone else were panicking :)"

"Going out of business, and then bankruptcy with $29 B debt ! Won't be able to pay like Everglade !"
@Phillip I didn't short Jks and I believe the Solar rally just begun. I learned the lesson not to hold Chinese Solar for long term. I wait the pull back then hit and run few points. I don't mind Jks goes up. I have no big dream for it.
Buy. Buy. Buy.
I sold 3000 shares that bought at 43.4 to take $2 per share profits. I still have 3000 shares that bought at 44.7!
JKS shots to the moon!
The price is reacting to the star market listing. But people don't seem to be talking about the massive energy shortages in China and the EU. That's going to have a positive effect on demand for alternatives.
"MASSIVE DISASTER... Year over year revenues FELL 6.2%, while year over year EPS FELL 10.2%... JUNKO has NEGATIVE GROWTH... they produce more and sell LESS IN REVENUES & PROFITS... while the MASSIVE DEBT IS SKYROCKETING.... 20 BILLION IN DEBT NOW.... Interest expense is SKYROCKETING... Junko bankrupt in 2023..."
Pick up some shares at 40.2! I am onboard again.
Next year at this time $100
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"Shorts have gone from 200k shares to 600k shares in the last day... and we still went up 3%! This is normally the most they'll sell short. If we hold, the stock will swing up 5-10% in the next four days as they cover."
"Thank Jinko, it's going up today! I unloaded the shares average at 44.4! I bought at 42.4 and 41.7 yesterday. Still hold the shares that bought at 44.55!"
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

"I do not know when the day will come, but all of you who have followed JKS for a significant amt of time know that it will go on some random day >$60. And when it goes, it GOES. lol! Long and strong."
Nice job everyone who bought and did not sell...they will probably try to bring it down again a bit....I am not selling mine....NOPE....60 minimum. This stock price should be triple digits.
Sleep today. There will be a higher price tomorrow.
"Yup, also confirmed in the PPT slide deck graphic. They had 31 GW capacity at end of June, and if they get close to the 30GW high-end prediction (I consider that unlikely, but would be very happy with 28 GW), it would be a fairly decent utilization rate compared to the industry average. Even if the added no further capacity in 2022, it would imply that Jinko could be selling close to about $10B worth of products by the end of 2022. For how much longer can the shorts keep them at around the ridiculous $2B market cap?"
"Days like these, one needs some good news. Blackrock, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley and other big players have been loading up on Jinko. That's probably what helped us longs get out of that hole at $29.... Enjoy the weekend!"
$60 expected before good earnings (9/15 after hours) and $70 after!
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Volume increasing... this stock has a brighter short term future than any other stock. No negative press anymore, big shorts bailing, hedge funds buying, US climate change policy ramping up, a huge 4th quarter in the works, and the China IPO. As Jim Harbaugh tells his players.... who has it better than us?"
"At $52, up 40% from Aug 19 low of 37.32. That's 40% in two weeks. And down 42% from 64.76 Jul 22 to 37.32. That's what we call volatility :) Whacky stock...."
been watching it for years. play ups and downs. can't lose
Hold
Co´s like JKS will solve China´s energy problem and make the whole world a better place! Bright future ahead for JKS which is on the way to be a disruptive global player in green energy!! Mark this post!!!
And Pat just made another $9k in 2 days :)
JUNKo has 20 BILLION in DEBT... and rising 20-30% a year with interest expense to service that mountain of debt SKYROCKETING... Bankruptcy is 100% GUARANTEED!!!!!
I feel earnings will be awesome.People are loading up my on panels the world over. A big bump in stock price will help mr jinko fulfill his happy journey
Watch out for $30
by the end of August 50 $
"I don't expect big moves toward $100 anymore until the FY21 results are in (especially a roaring Q4). We may hit $70 before that, but the combination of bad news is just a lovely lever for shorters - imagine - NASDAQ 2% down, Jinko 10% down. NASDAQ 1% up, Jinko 5% up. The fact that with gas, coal, nuclear costs sky rocketing, solar investments are even more attractive than ever, and everything solar manufacturers can produce will be sold, and for more money as well. Their profits should start to rise soon enough to similar levels as LONGI has enjoyed the past couple of years."
$46 today
The insiders have told us that JKS will have good margins going down the road. They didn't buy up 26% of JKS so they could put up over a third of what JKS made by selling stock. JKS is going to be making so much money they never have to sell stock again. JKS is going to go up a lot.
pure manipulation!!!
Nickel-Hydrogen Batteryhttps://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/nickel-hydrogen-battery-for-large-scale-renewables/
$60 this week baby!!!!!!!!
Doomplayer clearly a 
And another world record on solar cell efficiency - 25.4% - WOW Jinko!!! :)
Much too cheap…it is 70 usd Minimum worth.With a successful ipo it would be close to 100 usd.Green Energy is the great play in China and worldwide.
What is your feelings for tomorrow ?
Trina solar went private at 1.2 billion value few years ago. Today it is trading around 15 billions value in China. It's more than 12 times market cap.
"Hello Benjo, this is the margin call from Robinhood!"
We are a $200 Stock ! Till 2023 we go there. !!JKS $200 = 9 Billion $
In my opinion in 2025 will be $200 company
"Jinko is aiming to ship over 10 GW in modules in Q4, basically doubling revenues from third quarter to excess of $2.5 billion. Earnings could be well over $1.50 in Q4. Yes the company has disappointed in the first half of this year, but this is not the time to give up."
I think today is short squeezed day!
$80 we´re coming!
"It was to risky at 50, now even moreso."
Ridicolous
"Xi initiative and international boycott will puch this to Single digit, if not bankruptcy !!"
"If people want to know why this stock fluctuates so much just search ""JKS Short Interest"". Shorts opening and closing positions causes the swings. ."
Today going up in pre-market.
"AHAHAHAHHAHA How the f is possible? This is a 300$ stock, low market cap, what a barca in. JKS and CSIQ will make me rich in five years"
Just hold! Going up!
JKS and DQ are the best Chinese stocks !!!
Jinko beat expected EPS by 650%...
May Allah make it 60$
Seems like someone is pushing a false narrative hard
Let’s go JKS!
"I wrote this in 'Seeking Alpha' a week ago and no one read it'This could be a blessing in disguise for Jinko. Jinko is the only major Chinese solar company having manufacturing capabilities in US (Jacksonville, Florida). This could be Jinko's way to alleviate the tariff and WRO'It is the reason why Jinko went up todayhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3731704-jinkosolar-climbs-on-long-term-supply-deal-with-wacker-chemie"
Building the future
What a newssss
"""What we might be seeing is the market reverse its thinking on solar import restrictions. Instead of a headwind, like it might seem to be for JinkoSolar, it could be a tailwind because of the company's U.S. presence."" Golf clap to this author for trying to apply logic to JKS. Daqo outshined everyone today with no ties to the US that I'm aware of."
haha what manipulation. Let them play their games....the shorts will learn the hard way! Don't mess with JKS baby!
49 today
Good news for JKS
Haha. Put your seatbelts on! 
$70 is coming!
Is that market cap on yahoo finance accurate?
"Who thinks we are going back to $60? When? This board is quiet, let's add some life!! JKS to triple digits, baby!"
"JKS blows out earnings, it ups ups and only ups from here, buy all you can!"
Did anyone mention the Jeffries buy rating? On one analyst site I see an 80 dollar target. On another I see the first strong buy recently. We just need the market maker to wake up one day and let the run begin :)
$56-$58 before earings (9/15) - Earnings should be excellent!
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"The volatility in JKS is mind boggling. I have caught the channel trade a few times and will continue, seems like it just bounces between 40-60 back and forth..."
"The Doom Player steal the show today because he made $57000 in an hour Haha if you believe it! Well, I don't have this kind of luck as he did. But I bought 2000 shares at 46 and sold at 48. I am happy enough. Because I just a normal humans."
WOW! The open interest of calls for sept 17 for 45 50 55 60 65 70 is in the THOUSANDS! The big money shorts will need to cover and load up on calls and shares.IMO this could easily go to beyond 65-70 with excellent earnings…Your thoughts???(Good morning )
Let’s going to $60!
"As I said, no big dream for Jinko! I bought some at 44.7!"
Where are gurus predicting dip to 40s?
"Volume should pick up today. Yesterday was the market maker... there was no downside volume. Another plush indicator. Solar right now is cheaper than coal in China and getting cheaper. China has a huge carbon emissions problem and China is where solar happens. Put the 3 together and what does that mean? Also, nobody responded to my Elliot Wave buy indicator. It you don't follow it you should. On a macro perspective it is almost always right. And it forecasts the S&P going to 6000 and then back to 1000. Yes, that is correct... you might want to look at it."
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/Philip Shen, a solar-industry analyst with Roth Capital Partners, said his discussions with power utilities and other panel buyers indicate that JinkoSolar, based in Shanghai, has been among the hardest-hit manufacturers, with CBP detaining panels capable of generating about 100 megawatts worth of electricity. That’s enough to power about 29,000 homes a year"
"very choppy today, but hopefully we will end above $50 today."
"Hello Pat,It´s my pleasure to admit that the timing for your (re) - entry timing has been perfect - again!(Jinkosolar/Wacker deal). Furthermore,it will be interesting to hear the conference call of Daqo - i.e. whether they adress the huge discount of ADR to Daqo Xinjing valuation. As Jinkosolar ""always does ,what the market is doing"" any hint regarding a share swap/redemption of ADRs into China listed shares could stop risky shortselling and trigger appreciation of the share price instead.This would foremost impact Daqo but with a view on Jinkosolar´s STAR market listing raise the speculation of Jinko doing the same.Nevertheless as for this morning I´ll like to send my congratulations to you .Christian"
"Never know these days with earnings. But I did grab some before close, I do like this company short and long"
The infrastructure is close to going through. All solar stocks will take off like a rocket.
Jinkosolar is ahead of its competitors in diversifying the supply chain to avoid getting caught up in the ongoing trade dispute. Its future- forward approach includes signing polysilicon supply deals with Wacker and building up wafer plant in Vietnam.
add some shares average at43.1
Picked up a boat load down here today! JKS market cap should be at LEAST 3x.
I don’t see how any company has revenue of nearly 5B and their market cap is 2.2B.
Rotation into solar has begun. Short shares also down under 6 million... enjoy.
"Love this stock, and glad I kept buying when it was falling to $36, I hope we will break $60 soon!"
"Jinko is 70 usd Stock.China needs Solarenergy as you can actually see.Jinko will explode soon , the beginning with listing in Shanghai soon."
The Chinese stocks are being taken apart. just unbelievable!
"tips for tomorrow, check $10B buyback from QCOM issued AH..."
"Some excellent news again with longterm agreement with Wacker. Just like Jinko did with Xinte (sourcing polysilicion in Mongolia instead of Xinjiang), they are now going to source a significant amount of polysilicon from US/German plants which will (theoretically) allow them to manufacture safely for US/European markets free of tariffs and supply chain woes."
"Jinko has set up this year's sales in such a way that the Q4 estimates will be out early December where they are going to significantly increase both module sales, revenue and hopefully profit margin. This is a critical chess move to maximize the valuation of Jinko shares in the US, so that the IPO price in Shanghai can be set as high as possible. If the timing between meeting requirements on STAR SSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange), registration process, IPO price setting by SSE and first day of trading is similar to Daqo’s, then for Jinko this would be late Sept 21, early January 22, late January 22, and mid-February 22, respectively. The key is that between Q4 estimates in December and price setting of IPO shares late January, the US investment big shots respond to their Q4 results and move this stock past $100. Otherwise, we longs are going to be diluted by a lot more than we should be if the market were even remotely logical with JKS stock. Jinko has done everything possible to make themselves and US shareholders get rich with their stock."
JKS on the way to $60.
"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (""JinkoSolar"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: JKS), one of the largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world, is in the process of applying for an initial public offering (""IPO"") of its principal operating subsidiary, Jinko Solar Co., Ltd. (""Jiangxi Jinko""), on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Sci-Tech innovation board."
Pulled the trigger at 44.97 this morning with my 1450 shares. had them for just about 2 years with a $15 average. I'll be keeping an eye out for this to bottom and get back in. good luck to everyone!
One day the market cap of Jinko Solar will be $10B … you know what it means ….. Long and strong
"funny, every time jinko spikes we hear more unsubstantiated forced labour claims against jinko. No evidence connecting Hoshine, nevermind jinko's supplier Germany's Wacher Chemie. This seems like more of the Gordon Johnson mis-information bs."
Go jinko!!!
"The volatility in JKS is just nuts! I have been in an out and in and out....honestly think holding for the long term is the way to go so I do not miss out on a 100%, 200% jump...when this goes.....this goes!"
"EXPECT DOWNGRADES AHEAD: For the third quarter of 2021, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.24 billion to $1.37 billion vs. consensus of $1.60B. Gross margin for the third quarter is expected to be between 12% and 15% vs consensus 18%."
Ad at 42.10
Gut says 45 today
Someone knows when Jinko listing in Shanghai?????
get ready to see some discount on this stock. Silicon price is up to the moon
Jinko preliminary 9 month disclosure through Sept for revenues and net income for the subsidiary does not look like strong earnings. It might even suggest a loss based on the first 2 quarters results. No wonder it is tanking.
Finally I sold all the shares above 50. Good luck everyone! As I said no big dream for me. Jinko is my ATM machine.
$60 here I come!
"Sector selling off ahead of US solar earnings, ENPH. People assume they're going to be bad. I think people will be surprised how well Chinese solar does vs US, given massive energy shortages in China and not US. But that's just my thoughts."

"I honestly dont get this, it went to $60 after earning due to good growth and sales numbers. Then a day later it starts to sell off, down 35% in less than 2 weeks, with any real news other than some political bs that does not change their fundamentals. Really frustrating."
"All quiet on the western front.... Chinese solar stocks close to record highs. The ones trading in US, variable valuations."
profitable? check. So lets go...
Yep so ENPH crushed their earnings which is a good sign for all solar companies going forward 
Crazy jinko
Average 45
I also took profits this morning. Sold a little early actually but a profit is a profit.
End of the week $65
"Funny, instead of shorts getting progress on tariffs for imports from vietnam and malaysia they get IPO update... ouch. Will be interesting now that judge asked the anonymous requesters to name themselves."
Time to buy more ;)
"With the CATL deal, JKS will now become one of the big players in the energy storage business. Nice!"
"I am guessing that because of the issues with US Customs and Border Patrol, JKS’s guidance for the third quarter does not include any US shipments….which in a normal quarter would be $300 million. That explains q3 revenue guidance not being as strong as expected. But these issues will be resolved in time…"
"crazy how it got bought up to $55.99 and then big sellers came in! Just hold your shares...you will be glad :). No reason why this is not >$70....i mean it is one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world, now has partnership for storing energy...and have you seen in how many countries JKS SELLS???? this is worth much more than a $2B market cap.....geesh there are companies with much higher valuations that do not have nearly as much potential and do not have nearly the revenue or profit (will be much more once jinko can get expenses down)!"
Sell Sell Sell
Shorts sure shut up today  this is going IBD direction….. UP.

"We just finished a HUGE 2 year project up in the Midwest. Consisting of OVER 750,000 Solar Panels. I might start a position in JKS."
Fourth quarter shipments: the company is expecting to sell at least 10 GW of modules. Important to note that this number is higher than the company’s quarterly production capacity. The company has bought enough raw materials and has been building inventories in Q2 and Q3 to enable potential shipments to be as high as 14 GW - if the demand is there.
Manipulation at its best!!
I think it is exaggerated
EBITDA ValuationJune 2021 Value: $60June 2022 Value: $90
Jks shots to the moon
I couldn't believe my eyes today and have been waiting all day for a correction from 45GW to 35GW module capacity.... What an amazing change from last quarter if that number is really true!
"forgive me, I don't have much experience reading earnings reports.. Did JKS turn profitable during a global pandemic AND sign multiple deals to hedge geopolitical targeting? This stock plays with my emotions daily, just looking for reassurance to keep holding."
"Stiesdalhttps://www.stiesdal.com/storage/the-gridscale-technology-explained/The GridScale range covers both the 12-18 h duration required for day-to-day smoothing of solar PV, and the 3 to 7 days duration required for smoothing of wind power over gaps caused by low wind periods."
"So ""pat"" - Did you sell your $44.55 shares, yet? :)"
"How great it is to know what the fourth quarter is holding for this company. Module prices finally took a good move up around 4-5% (polysilicon 15% !!!). Inflation isn't just happening with coal, oil and gas boys and girls...."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."

Wowwwwwww
"All solar companies listed in China are rated on the stock exchange as follows:LONGI SOLAR $ 80 BILLIONTrina Solar $ 15 BillionJASolar $ 15 BillionJINKO Solar is valued only 2.1 billion. We have a lot of catching up to do! In terms of balance, however, they are better positioned. Because they got fresh capital in the Chinese stock exchange. Technologically, we are even better! There is a lot of catching up to do.We will be worth 10 billion in the coming years. So $ 200. We'll be there by the end of 2023 I think."
Last year this time it was $90.... a year later is at $45... next year will be at $22.5.... market it down...
Has anyone wondered whom Jinko sold the 792 MW cells & wafers to the first quarter and whom they continue to sell wafers and cells to? Jinko is now #4 vendor of modules for H1/21 after being number 1 for 2016-2019 and 2nd last year. So they are willing to forgo maintaining their output lead in order to reign in potential losses? Wouldn't it be ironic if Jinko sold some of those wafers/cells to Trina or JA Solar?

Good news! Going up in pre-market!
"JKS short interest has actually been going down the past months, but it's still the second highest percentage of shares outstanding (about 14% just behind RUN) that is shorted. So the shorts are still not giving up on Jinko until they lose a lot more money playing this one up and down...."
Can anyone who knows tell me what’s driving this stock down everyday? I think it’s unrelated to the crackdown unless of course investors are just dumping all Chinese stocks.

"In next few days, JKS will make a big move up. The catalyst is this: 晶科9/30上会"
This is a good bankruptcy candidate like evergrande ! Too much debt and can't issue more shares ! Stay away !
"Gap at $47.75 from Oct. 8/Oct. 11. I do not think I will be buying until that fills and I think we could see $44-$45 another time before we go higher. Of course, if there is STAR listing news or another major catalyst, then all bets are off. This is just what I am seeing from the charts. I am bullish long term."
Going to $2-3. Let evergrande file bankruptcy. The Chinese companies r manipulating stock prices.
JKS going to $60.
"Special interest/Hedge fund henchman Gordon Johnson of GLJ research lowered the firm's price target on JinkoSolar to $10.70 from $12.94 and keeps a Sell rating on the shares following yesterday's Q2 results.

No big research firms would hire him - but infact he was fired from even smaller research firms that he used to work for e.g. Vertical and Axiom groups in 2018/2019. * Just google 'Gordon Johnson tesla' and watch tons of video clips on how this clown has made a fool of himself multiple times in front of media and investors. And also how many others have debunked this loser."
Pre-market 52.47 :)
Jinko is a great company with even short squeeze potential
"Serious question - anyone here considers de-listing a possibility?I personally don't as it would limit company from getting source of funding in case it needs it.Yes, short cnts are using US listing as shorting stock but nonetheless when STAR comes in it makes sense to keep both up as US side would inevitable arbitrage to local (or get quite close).THing is - I am long 2023 options on Jinko and if it gets delisted it turns NULL, if it stays on, then I am loading more. Just thinking out loud, would be good to hear your views gents."
"$60 again will be nice!!! All Chinese stocks (BIDU BABA JD DQ JKS NIO XPEV, etc.) are up as well...GLTA!"

"haha, it reached my 50 target ! What should I do?"
Jinko moves so fast! Two days ago it was 48.18 and today it reach 41.58! Omg
Good news from FSLR guys so JKDS & DQ will be doing well!
who is waiting to buy? :)
My Price Target still 200$ for 2023 !!!
"Oct 14 short % of shares outstanding at a record low of 10.4% since I've started seriously watching this stock. That doesn't mean the price will rise a lot fast, but it means that short sellers are getting cautious and prepared for a major price increase the coming months. At least, they're not as willing to bet against them anymore as they used to. This has shown up clearly in a lot lower volatility from what I can see."
Iron-Air Batteryhttps://youtu.be/UDjgSSO98VI
Jks has energy today. All the bears hide away LOL. No more bankruptcy talk!
Market is uneasy these days.Chinese owned JKS is no different. I expect a big beat but where will the stock go...is the big question. Can’t be a better time for Solar to fly
