A diamond in the rough!
"Hello Pat,It´s my pleasure to admit that the timing for your (re) - entry timing has been perfect - again!(Jinkosolar/Wacker deal). Furthermore,it will be interesting to hear the conference call of Daqo - i.e. whether they adress the huge discount of ADR to Daqo Xinjing valuation. As Jinkosolar ""always does ,what the market is doing"" any hint regarding a share swap/redemption of ADRs into China listed shares could stop risky shortselling and trigger appreciation of the share price instead.This would foremost impact Daqo but with a view on Jinkosolar´s STAR market listing raise the speculation of Jinko doing the same.Nevertheless as for this morning I´ll like to send my congratulations to you .Christian"

Just hold! Going up!
when is the ipo for star? anyone please?
Gut says 45 today
"Careful when shorts take up almost 3X of average daily volume figure, especially at over bought area. This is JKS, not John Deere. Accumulated blocks at $41.88 this morning."
"The volatility in JKS is mind boggling. I have caught the channel trade a few times and will continue, seems like it just bounces between 40-60 back and forth..."
EBITDA ValuationJune 2021 Value: $60June 2022 Value: $90
Last year this time it was $90.... a year later is at $45... next year will be at $22.5.... market it down...
JKS going to $60.
"Special interest/Hedge fund henchman Gordon Johnson of GLJ research lowered the firm's price target on JinkoSolar to $10.70 from $12.94 and keeps a Sell rating on the shares following yesterday's Q2 results. Who is this guy?GLJ Research (Gordon Johnson):* A twisted mind with ulterior motives e.g. he pretends to cover 'Alt Energy' but ends up giving SELL rating top practically every company (72% Sells including calls for TSLA to go bankrupt since the demand for their cars is collapsing!)* A classic FUD proponent who is amongst the worst of the worst in terms of track record, Ranked #7,365 out of 7,641 Analysts on TipRanks (#15,268 out of 15,783 overall experts) with a average return of NEGATIVE 7% ... he is actually be a good contrarian play!* He is delusion about his own competence, which he only maintains by lying to himself. No big research firms would hire him - but infact he was fired from even smaller research firms that he used to work for e.g. Vertical and Axiom groups in 2018/2019. * Just google 'Gordon Johnson tesla' and watch tons of video clips on how this clown has made a fool of himself multiple times in front of media and investors. And also how many others have debunked this loser."
"Let's JKS drop to $30, we are making amazing jump to $100 from $30.Let's sell together and buy the dip."
Did anyone mention the Jeffries buy rating? On one analyst site I see an 80 dollar target. On another I see the first strong buy recently. We just need the market maker to wake up one day and let the run begin :)
End of the week $65
"""What we might be seeing is the market reverse its thinking on solar import restrictions. Instead of a headwind, like it might seem to be for JinkoSolar, it could be a tailwind because of the company's U.S. presence."" Golf clap to this author for trying to apply logic to JKS. Daqo outshined everyone today with no ties to the US that I'm aware of."
Manipulation at its best!!
USA does not want product sourced in China!!!
I bought 20 calls last week guys !JKS Sep 17 2021 55 CallGo JKS DQ BABA NVAX FUBO.....
"CFRA is entitled to their opinion about the future no matter how ill-informed. My own analysis suggests the next two years are going to be a period of sustained growth of at least 30% in unit shipments of modules, relatively stable pricing because of limited poly silicon supply and growing concentration of market share, and therefore IMPROVING gross margins which could exceed 20% by 2022. Also JKS is now a vertically integrated module maker which means they capture internally all the margin that goes to the wafer makers.As a result $5.00 in 2021 earnings is conservative, $6.00 is likely and $7.00 is possible.Similarly in 2022, $7.00 is conservative, $8.00 is likely, and $9.00 is possible.As this improving margin and earnings picture unfolds, I think the P/E multiple will expand as well. Stocks like ENPH and DQ have demonstrated that when margins expand, out of favor stocks with low multiples can experience MASSIVE multiple expansion. So a 20X multiple is definitely in JKS’ future."
"Yup, also confirmed in the PPT slide deck graphic. They had 31 GW capacity at end of June, and if they get close to the 30GW high-end prediction (I consider that unlikely, but would be very happy with 28 GW), it would be a fairly decent utilization rate compared to the industry average. Even if the added no further capacity in 2022, it would imply that Jinko could be selling close to about $10B worth of products by the end of 2022. For how much longer can the shorts keep them at around the ridiculous $2B market cap?"
what is all this bankruptcy talk anyway???
Great future
been watching it for years. play ups and downs. can't lose
Oh what's going on Zacks ... ? why this sector is falling down ?
"Hello Benjo, this is the margin call from Robinhood!"
Let’s going to $60!
who is waiting to buy? :)
"Is this true that JINKO will be removed from US market? I heard that, and now people selling this. Often Chinese news are not told in English."
I also took profits this morning. Sold a little early actually but a profit is a profit.
Ad at 42.10
@Phillip I didn't short Jks and I believe the Solar rally just begun. I learned the lesson not to hold Chinese Solar for long term. I wait the pull back then hit and run few points. I don't mind Jks goes up. I have no big dream for it.
Ups and ups!
"tips for tomorrow, check $10B buyback from QCOM issued AH..."
pure manipulation!!!
Hold
Average 45
I think today is short squeezed day!
Nice job everyone who bought and did not sell...they will probably try to bring it down again a bit....I am not selling mine....NOPE....60 minimum. This stock price should be triple digits.
Jinko beat expected EPS by 650%...
When the shorts cover and this shoots up 13% in a day you'll wish you bought more.
In my opinion in 2025 will be $200 company
https://discord.com/invite/hNeJHaC4
$60 today???
Single digit is coming.
"this is one of those Yo-Yo stocks. Over the past year, it would have been profitable to buy in the 40s and sell at 60 and repeat."
Let's go Jinko!
"Going out of business, and then bankruptcy with $29 B debt ! Won't be able to pay like Everglade !"
US shareholders own ZERO of the company. The ADS shares of Chinese companies are structured that way that they do NOT own any part of the company. So if Junko or Daqo decides to pull out of the US stock market they can do that with US shareholders getting ZERO. There is a great article about that on WSJ. I suggest you guys read it.

This will be bankrupt !! Debt can't be paid off for years to come. $29 B debt is too much.
"This is crazy, Dow, and Nasdaq are soaring and we are red again."
Pick up some shares at 40.2! I am onboard again.
"As a US citizen I like the idea of being self sufficient when it comes to transitioning to renewable energy. However, won't this further delay our transition to solar? also, eith Jinko having ties to US already, why are we suffering the largest drop from this news? I'm still long, just asking why."
"Jinkosolar is a totally undervalued stock!Here are the facts:Jinkosolar is the world leader (number one in China, Middle East, Australia and Europe and number 2/3 in the US) in the solar module business. Furthermore, this company is also technology leader for monocrysaline PV modules. It was the first vertical integrated PV module producer in the world, which covers the whole process (wafer, cells, modules). Adding to this, the company is massivley expanding its business into new areas (they are one of the biggest solar project companies, e.g. they finalized currently the 1 billion US$ project in VAE in conneciton with EDF, which will lead to the sale of 4 Million modules in 2021) and into the battery energy storage. They started to sell it in December!). As China, Europe etc. are moving to renewables as well as the situation that more and more countries reach grid parity, the company still invests massivley into the expansion of the production facilites to cover the demand, which will lead to massiv growth in the near future. Furthermore, the massiv push of countries into the hydrogen economy will also lead to growth of the solar sector. The only useful hydrogen production will be ""green hydrogen"" produced by solar or wind. Adding to this, the PV producer market has already gone through a major consolidation. While companies like Sunedision, Solarworld or Q-Cells went bancrupt, the five biggest PV producer of the world already have a marketshare of around 70%. They will dominate the ASPs in the near future, which will be beneficial for the margins.This company is only 15 years old, but will make already 5 billion revenues in 2020 and grows by around 20% at the moment. They earn money; Ebitda positiv by around 700-750 million in 2020 and 150 mill net (before currency valuations). Even as the margins came under pressure due to some raw material shortages....this will be over in the coming months, as new solar glass and polysilicon facilities come online (refer to CEO of Daqo and Trina Solar). The stock valuation of Jinkosolar is ridicolous compared to hydrogen companies or some solar companies, like Sunpower (which will miss the future, except TOTAL will fully buy it!) or First Solar. If you would compare it to a PLUG POWER, Jinko should be traded by around 1.500 US$, while if you would take First Solar (which is smaller than Jinkosolar) into account, the company should be valued by around 250 US$.The stock increase of 120% in 2020 was ok, but I really look forward to 2021, especially since the IPO of the project daughter will also lead to an increase of the valuation. This company is already valued in the ""road show"" process by around 4 billion US$, which would be more of the 3 billion, which Jinko is traded at the moment. Totally long and bullish!"
WOW! The open interest of calls for sept 17 for 45 50 55 60 65 70 is in the THOUSANDS! The big money shorts will need to cover and load up on calls and shares.IMO this could easily go to beyond 65-70 with excellent earnings…Your thoughts???(Good morning )
"forgive me, I don't have much experience reading earnings reports.. Did JKS turn profitable during a global pandemic AND sign multiple deals to hedge geopolitical targeting? This stock plays with my emotions daily, just looking for reassurance to keep holding."
"Gap at $47.75 from Oct. 8/Oct. 11. I do not think I will be buying until that fills and I think we could see $44-$45 another time before we go higher. Of course, if there is STAR listing news or another major catalyst, then all bets are off. This is just what I am seeing from the charts. I am bullish long term. Good luck all."
"When Evergrande fall down a few days ago jinko fall down a lot , but now Evengrande rise up and Jinko keeps go down . Someone can explain it to me ?"
"Wow, JKS up 3 points today!"
"Serious question - anyone here considers de-listing a possibility?I personally don't as it would limit company from getting source of funding in case it needs it.Yes, short cnts are using US listing as shorting stock but nonetheless when STAR comes in it makes sense to keep both up as US side would inevitable arbitrage to local (or get quite close).THing is - I am long 2023 options on Jinko and if it gets delisted it turns NULL, if it stays on, then I am loading more. Just thinking out loud, would be good to hear your views gents."
"This stock is so strange, it was over $60 only a few weeks ago after a great earning, then it dropped to $38 with no bad news at all, now its popping with no news either. But it deserves to be higher. Congratulations for those who bought in under $40 just less than 2 weeks ago while everyone else were panicking :)"
"EXPECT DOWNGRADES AHEAD: For the third quarter of 2021, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.24 billion to $1.37 billion vs. consensus of $1.60B. Gross margin for the third quarter is expected to be between 12% and 15% vs consensus 18%."
$60 this week baby!!!!!!!!
Trina solar went private at 1.2 billion value few years ago. Today it is trading around 15 billions value in China. It's more than 12 times market cap.
"I do not know when the day will come, but all of you who have followed JKS for a significant amt of time know that it will go on some random day >$60. And when it goes, it GOES. lol! Long and strong."
"In next few days, JKS will make a big move up. The catalyst is this: 晶科9/30上会"
Ridicolous
China will be coming for your shares. They are in the process of consolidating everything that is China back under its control. The first step is the public listing of manufacturing that is going to dilute your shares. The next step is calling in their loans in essence bankrupting them and selling the assets to the new shareholders and debt holders.
DO not let these shorts scare you into bankruptcy talk. Look at how many calls have been traded for sept 17 alone....50 55 60 65......thousands. this is going one direction - UP.

JUNKo has 20 BILLION in DEBT... and rising 20-30% a year with interest expense to service that mountain of debt SKYROCKETING... Bankruptcy is 100% GUARANTEED!!!!!
Market is uneasy these days.Chinese owned JKS is no different. I expect a big beat but where will the stock go...is the big question. Can’t be a better time for Solar to fly

i live on the big island of hawaii and just drove by a big pv operation they're building near me. i noticed boxes with jinko printed on them. decided to investigate for myself. i was thinking made in china panels but it appears the panels are made in florida?
"Today 48+, Monday 50+"
JKS shots to the moon!
I’m looking forward to shorts getting absolutely fried when these earnings are great on the 15th
Must love BABA JKS DQ NVAX DVAX guys!
Can anyone who knows tell me what’s driving this stock down everyday? I think it’s unrelated to the crackdown unless of course investors are just dumping all Chinese stocks.
Sell before bankruptcy !!
get ready to see some discount on this stock. Silicon price is up to the moon
This is the future
"Down below 52! These big guys play games and think we are going to fall for it See you at 60, suckazzzz "
"Jinko has set up this year's sales in such a way that the Q4 estimates will be out early December where they are going to significantly increase both module sales, revenue and hopefully profit margin. This is a critical chess move to maximize the valuation of Jinko shares in the US, so that the IPO price in Shanghai can be set as high as possible. If the timing between meeting requirements on STAR SSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange), registration process, IPO price setting by SSE and first day of trading is similar to Daqo’s, then for Jinko this would be late Sept 21, early January 22, late January 22, and mid-February 22, respectively. The key is that between Q4 estimates in December and price setting of IPO shares late January, the US investment big shots respond to their Q4 results and move this stock past $100. Otherwise, we longs are going to be diluted by a lot more than we should be if the market were even remotely logical with JKS stock. Jinko has done everything possible to make themselves and US shareholders get rich with their stock."
My Price Target still 200$ for 2023 !!!
time to load ! round 4  100k at 38

Time to buy more ;)

"All solar companies listed in China are rated on the stock exchange as follows:LONGI SOLAR $ 80 BILLIONTrina Solar $ 15 BillionJASolar $ 15 BillionJINKO Solar is valued only 2.1 billion. We have a lot of catching up to do! In terms of balance, however, they are better positioned. Because they got fresh capital in the Chinese stock exchange. Technologically, we are even better! There is a lot of catching up to do.We will be worth 10 billion in the coming years. So $ 200. We'll be there by the end of 2023 I think."
I couldn't believe my eyes today and have been waiting all day for a correction from 45GW to 35GW module capacity.... What an amazing change from last quarter if that number is really true!
"$60 again will be nice!!! All Chinese stocks (BIDU BABA JD DQ JKS NIO XPEV, etc.) are up as well...GLTA!"

"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (""JinkoSolar"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: JKS), one of the largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world, is in the process of applying for an initial public offering (""IPO"") of its principal operating subsidiary, Jinko Solar Co., Ltd. (""Jiangxi Jinko""), on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Sci-Tech innovation board."
I like how shorts post FUD on Yahoo finance as if this is what will swing the price down. We're out here buying a few hundred shares lol.
Has anyone wondered whom Jinko sold the 792 MW cells & wafers to the first quarter and whom they continue to sell wafers and cells to? Jinko is now #4 vendor of modules for H1/21 after being number 1 for 2016-2019 and 2nd last year. So they are willing to forgo maintaining their output lead in order to reign in potential losses? Wouldn't it be ironic if Jinko sold some of those wafers/cells to Trina or JA Solar?
The only time I have seen a severe free fall like this when company completely have missed their earnings.
Jinko is a great company with even short squeeze potential
"I am currently long JKS, but I have a question for chartists or others that may have more experience than me. Does anyone believe the gap of $31.92 from May 19th will get filled? I understand gaps do fill about 90% of the time, but could this be one of the 10% of the times it does not. Sincere question. I love the company and have been long for quite some time. Just wanted others opinions."
Good news for JKS
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/Philip Shen, a solar-industry analyst with Roth Capital Partners, said his discussions with power utilities and other panel buyers indicate that JinkoSolar, based in Shanghai, has been among the hardest-hit manufacturers, with CBP detaining panels capable of generating about 100 megawatts worth of electricity. That’s enough to power about 29,000 homes a year"
Fourth quarter shipments: the company is expecting to sell at least 10 GW of modules. Important to note that this number is higher than the company’s quarterly production capacity. The company has bought enough raw materials and has been building inventories in Q2 and Q3 to enable potential shipments to be as high as 14 GW - if the demand is there.
Pulled the trigger at 44.97 this morning with my 1450 shares. had them for just about 2 years with a $15 average. I'll be keeping an eye out for this to bottom and get back in. good luck to everyone!
"Jonko is a great leader company in solar technolgy and was rewarded very often for their technical leadership.The fair valu is at about 75 USD.Hope this #$%$ will be over soon.At this level a strong buy, so my personal opinion. Clima aspects will let the solar business massivly within next years."
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
getting ready to buy !!!!! just has to dip a little more 
Watch out for $30
"ok around you. The world is literally melting,. Calls for reduced carbon emissions. Whether you believe the bs or not the reaction of the people is real. Governments are going to push renewables hard. JKS has the most growth potential, the others often quoted as doing better have already reached their ceilings. It's the smaller players that will benefit from this the most."
What is your feelings for tomorrow ?
Much too cheap…it is 70 usd Minimum worth.With a successful ipo it would be close to 100 usd.Green Energy is the great play in China and worldwide.
Jks ups and ups!
"very choppy today, but hopefully we will end above $50 today."
Next top is $70.
JKS business is in a growing market. JKS is the market leader in it.Around 20 % market share.The growth rate for the next five years will be around 20-25 % yearly worldwide.JKS will participate at least on this level from sales point of view.JKS produce the solar panel with the highest efficiency in the market.There are several panels with a higher efficiency but only under laboratory conditions.Mass production of these panels is years away. Simply too expensive.JKS will be the market leader for many more years.Here in Germany the share of green electrical energy production is around 50 % in 2020.Mainly solar and wind energy. Other countries have to follow to reduce CO2 production.Expected 2021 EPS = around 6 $Expected 2022 EPS = around 7.5 - 8 $Fair P/E 2021 is 15-20. That means 90 - 120 $ share priceFair P/E 2022 is 15-20. That means 110 - 160 $ share price.Basically a still perfect buying oportunity.But there is only one thing to consider...It's a Chinese company...The daily action in stock volume is not normal.
Destroyed the stock price today!
I could not believe it that I bought JKS at awesome price today - 2K shares!
"Gap at $47.75 from Oct. 8/Oct. 11. I do not think I will be buying until that fills and I think we could see $44-$45 another time before we go higher. Of course, if there is STAR listing news or another major catalyst, then all bets are off. This is just what I am seeing from the charts. I am bullish long term."
"Company just announced details of the IPO filing….no surprises. They want to raise around $800 million to $1 billion and the number of shares they have to sell will obviously depend on the stock price.Currently, JKS trades at one-third the EBITDA multiple of its peers in China…. So if we equalize the EBITDA multiple, the stock should be at $120 and they will need to sell only the equivalent of 8 million ADSs to raise their target of a billion."
Jinko preliminary 9 month disclosure through Sept for revenues and net income for the subsidiary does not look like strong earnings. It might even suggest a loss based on the first 2 quarters results. No wonder it is tanking.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/27/customs-detains-chinese-solar-panels/
And another world record on solar cell efficiency - 25.4% - WOW Jinko!!! :)
"I honestly dont get this, it went to $60 after earning due to good growth and sales numbers. Then a day later it starts to sell off, down 35% in less than 2 weeks, with any real news other than some political bs that does not change their fundamentals. Really frustrating."
Once more into the breach 
Crazy jinko
I don’t see how any company has revenue of nearly 5B and their market cap is 2.2B.
I took my 3 points per share profits and walk away. It's $7500 profits in two hour. Thanks JKS!
Going to $2-3. Let evergrande file bankruptcy. The Chinese companies r manipulating stock prices.
profitable? check. So lets go...
$60 expected before good earnings (9/15 after hours) and $70 after!

JKS and DQ are the best Chinese stocks !!!
Today going up in pre-market.
"How to raise the share price?The problem:Market capitalisation in USD:Longi: 65bnTongwei: 25bnJaSolar: 12bnTrina Solar: 8bnJinkosolar: 2bn The fastest and most efficient solution is laid out in the mail below to JKS Investors Relation.If you want to move the stock upwards you should send an mail to JKS instead of writing here...Dear Sir or Madam, JinkoSolar has a persisting low market valuation compared to its china listed peer group. This makes the company potentially vulnerable and poses an unnecessary threat to success. JinkoSolar announced to list Jiangxi Jinko at China STAR market to get better access to capital markets after enduring the complex listing procedure. Not the missing China listing is what is standing in the way to raise the Mcap, it is more the fact to be listed on NASDAQ where Chinese solar stocks have traditionally a detrimental existence. As long as the US are responsible for the fate of the share price of JKS there won´t be a sustainable base. JinkoSolar is listed in Germany as well and has a very enthusiastic supportive community which provides a trade volume of several hundred thousand shares on good days, more than enough given the actual free float. The daily trading of JKS stock always follows the same pattern which shows a positive trend until the US market opens the gates to the casino. Unfortunately there seems to be a long road until a china listing of the daughter company could provide some support for the JKS stock on NASDAQ - possibly. JKS´s Capex guidance for this year raises the question of an overloaden debt burden which itself suppresses the stock price and would lead to a very dilutive stock placement if necessary. This is a risk which a highly valued company (i.e. Longi) doesn´t have at all. The lack of this risk alone works like a bulletproof backstop for a plunging share price. JKS is currently in the opposite situation and exposed to any kind of price speculation. A hypothetical raise of 500mn USD capital by equity would mean in case of Longi an indiscernible dilution of less than 1%. To get the same amount of money, JKS had to issue additional 30% of its outstanding stock! This is a misfortune which can´t be compensated elsewhere. Therefore I would like to give you the advice to simply delist JKS from NASDAQ trading. This is no detrimental point for the company´s image. There are no big hurdles which would take time to realize this move. Any ADRs can easily be traded in Germany as well as in the US. The German TRADEGATE exchange is opened until the usual US closing. There is no timely extensive procedure of requirements to overcome. There is no costly redemption or conversion in the forefront. Even US customers of JKS´s solar products will certainly prefer a sound, well financed company which can offer competitive priced products instead of a company that sacrifices its edge to the notorious mispriced valuation on NASDAQ. When the announcement of this liberating shift is communicated reasonably there will rather be a sigh of relief than a meaningful share price dip and the bounce back of the JKS stock which is trading then mainly on TRADEGATE / Germany will be stellar - and based on a far more solid and predictable footing. There are many European green energy companies with far higher valuation thanks to their main listing in Germany. The market is by far big enough for any capital-requiring measures. There are a lot of influential german analysts in the financial media promoting JKS day by day to investors but any up-move to the stock price suffocates when NASDAQ opens. Most JKS investors - even in the US - would highly welcome to get rid of NASDAQ´s continuously bearish impact on ""suspicious"" Chinese stocks. The US bias towards China seems to be far from a turnaround and will further suppress JKS stock price, its company value and its refinancing abilities as long as the US listing keeps to be market making - irrespective of any achievements JKS provides.The fact that a high market capitalization itself accounts for the possible success of a company in today´s markets could be crucial for JKS to stay in the solar worlds´ well financed top tier. With respect to recent market developments in the solar industry as well as in the political environment and especially with respect to the financial markets´ stance to JKS, I would highly appreciate if you consider this remark seriously. I would appreciate your feedback. Kind regards,"

Jinko moves so fast! Two days ago it was 48.18 and today it reach 41.58! Omg
Picked up a boat load down here today! JKS market cap should be at LEAST 3x.
"I am guessing that because of the issues with US Customs and Border Patrol, JKS’s guidance for the third quarter does not include any US shipments….which in a normal quarter would be $300 million. That explains q3 revenue guidance not being as strong as expected. But these issues will be resolved in time…"
add more at 43.4!
"It sure didn’t want to, but We broke $51 for about 30 seconds, haha! Huge resistance at 51. Wait until that wall gets brought down….. when it does, see you at $60!"
Jks has energy today. All the bears hide away LOL. No more bankruptcy talk!
shorts squeezed
"Stiesdalhttps://www.stiesdal.com/storage/the-gridscale-technology-explained/The GridScale range covers both the 12-18 h duration required for day-to-day smoothing of solar PV, and the 3 to 7 days duration required for smoothing of wind power over gaps caused by low wind periods."
Unbelievable..
Finally I sold all the shares above 50. Good luck everyone! As I said no big dream for me. Jinko is my ATM machine.
"Jinko’s listing on the STAR market is likely to happen in the next few months, earlier than the 2022 that was previously expected. The valuation is also likely to be 50% to 100% higher than the valuation in the US market. This will allow them to raise larger amounts of capital at much lower cost and even pay down some debt. This would be the mecahnism by which the price and valuation gap between US and Chonese markets will narrow."
"Some excellent news again with longterm agreement with Wacker. Just like Jinko did with Xinte (sourcing polysilicion in Mongolia instead of Xinjiang), they are now going to source a significant amount of polysilicon from US/German plants which will (theoretically) allow them to manufacture safely for US/European markets free of tariffs and supply chain woes."
"FSR CSIQ and SPWR are all up, time to add JKS! IMO"
What a newssss
I feel earnings will be awesome.People are loading up my on panels the world over. A big bump in stock price will help mr jinko fulfill his happy journey
I am not greedy. I sold 3000 shares average at 51. 6 and close my position. I made 8 per share. Good luck everyone!
add some shares average at43.1
I sold 3000 shares that bought at 43.4 to take $2 per share profits. I still have 3000 shares that bought at 44.7!
"Thank Jinko, it's going up today! I unloaded the shares average at 44.4! I bought at 42.4 and 41.7 yesterday. Still hold the shares that bought at 44.55!"
"The most obvious reason to push this stock price down is to make a killing in China. Anyone who doesn't catch on to this, must be blind or naive. Daqo has proven that the Shanghai IPO's fetch a massive premium, and that in China, these companies get valued as their peers do (Trina, JA Solar, Tongwei, Xinte, etc.) By pushing the price as low as possible, any hedge fund (could be Morgan Stanley, too, since the STAR IPO is not only available to Chinese investors) that can get in on that IPO can buy up an ever larger percentage of Jinko for practically nothing, and make a fortune the first day this baby trades in STAR. As I already posted, if the Jinko price can be kept around $40-50, they'll have to sell 25% or more to get the $1B capital they are looking to get, leaving us US longs with less than 50% of the company, but without any gurantees that arbitraging will happen. (It's certainly not happening for DQ....) I'm ever more convinced of the fact that there are powerful hedge funds behind this to walk away with billions in a few months. A no brainer...."
Pre-market going UP!
Nickel-Hydrogen Batteryhttps://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/nickel-hydrogen-battery-for-large-scale-renewables/
Rotation into solar has begun. Short shares also down under 6 million... enjoy.
$46 today
This is a good bankruptcy candidate like evergrande ! Too much debt and can't issue more shares ! Stay away !
"Canadian Solar’s results have very positive implications for JKS…. Gross margins are likely to be much better than guidance AGAIN: pricing is moving up for modules, cost increases are stabilizing and these trends are going to be repeated in the third quarter.My guess is JKS will do better than 17% gross margin in q2 and q3 will be 18% to 20%! That’s much better than what perennially bearish (and wrong!) Wall Street analysts are saying right now."
"How great it is to know what the fourth quarter is holding for this company. Module prices finally took a good move up around 4-5% (polysilicon 15% !!!). Inflation isn't just happening with coal, oil and gas boys and girls...."
Jks shots to the moon
"I don't expect big moves toward $100 anymore until the FY21 results are in (especially a roaring Q4). We may hit $70 before that, but the combination of bad news is just a lovely lever for shorters - imagine - NASDAQ 2% down, Jinko 10% down. NASDAQ 1% up, Jinko 5% up. The fact that with gas, coal, nuclear costs sky rocketing, solar investments are even more attractive than ever, and everything solar manufacturers can produce will be sold, and for more money as well. Their profits should start to rise soon enough to similar levels as LONGI has enjoyed the past couple of years."
"Who thinks we are going back to $60? When? This board is quiet, let's add some life!! JKS to triple digits, baby!"
Shorts sure shut up today  this is going IBD direction….. UP.
Now today looked like pure steady market manipulation all day long.
"Another thing that I didn't like at all about the Q1 report is the way they seemed to do an almost panic driven switch from just module production to selling wafers and cells without any explanation during the quarterly report. They were talking about gaining market share in module sales world-wide the past year, and all of a sudden, they're substantially reducing module production.... So much for gaining more market share in that space."
One day the market cap of Jinko Solar will be $10B … you know what it means ….. Long and strong
Thanks to (http://trademarketview.tech) I have saved hours of research for stock picks. Their daily watchlists help me make the most of my trades each day!
Seems like someone is pushing a false narrative hard
"What silence in August. Has given me time to do more research, and I was surprised that I hadn't noticed that Jinko's growth rate YoY Q1 20 to 21 was zero while Trina, JA Solar, LONGI, and Risen have had outstanding growth rates. The same is true for quarter over quarter growths for the whole past year. I'm starting to get nervous about Jinko's ability to compete with the Chinese traded players that have much better access to capital due to their far higher market valuations than Jinko has in the US. The US has managed to really throttle Jinko to the brink of bankruptcy where I'm wondering if they will survive 5 years down the road.... The STAR listing may be coming too little too late.... Hopefully I'm not really seeing the next Yingli or Suntech Power in the making...."
"The volatility in JKS is just nuts! I have been in an out and in and out....honestly think holding for the long term is the way to go so I do not miss out on a 100%, 200% jump...when this goes.....this goes!"
$56-$58 before earings (9/15) - Earnings should be excellent!
49 today
this stock is about to make me another 50k east over the next month. I'll do you a favor. invest anywhere between 35 and 45 and sell anywhere between 55-65 . prepare to hold long term. average down when appropriate . done it 3 times already $JKS isn't going anywhere. and definitely isn't going bankrupt  LFG 
"JinkoSolar shipment into U.S. stopped by customs, says GLJ Research GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson said in an email to clients that his checks have confirmed that one of JinkoSolar's (JKS) shipments into the U.S. was stopped by U.S. customs, requesting proof that the products were not using HeSheng's silicon metal material."
"I sold 3000 shares (average 44.35) that bought at 41.75, about 2.6 per share profits. Still hold the shares that bought at 44.55! go JKS"
by the end of August 50 $
"Their sales-guidance is brutal!! For 2021 Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4: 5GW, 5GW, 5GW and 10-15GW! 45 GW for next year. Wow!!!"
"JKS blows out earnings, it ups ups and only ups from here, buy all you can!"
I am lowering target from $19 to $9 with very strong sell rating.
This kind of stupid trading for JKS were happening so many times. Wall Street doesn't care how good of the earning. They just attacked it. use any excuses to sell it. Because this is a Chinese Solar company.
All solar stocks drop today.
"We just finished a HUGE 2 year project up in the Midwest. Consisting of OVER 750,000 Solar Panels. I might start a position in JKS."
I heard about JKS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Are you ready to buy? :)
"Jinko is 70 usd Stock.China needs Solarenergy as you can actually see.Jinko will explode soon , the beginning with listing in Shanghai soon."
"JKS short interest has actually been going down the past months, but it's still the second highest percentage of shares outstanding (about 14% just behind RUN) that is shorted. So the shorts are still not giving up on Jinko until they lose a lot more money playing this one up and down...."
"I bought in at 46 , what we all need to remember is time in market, NOT timing the market! no panic ...this will be back up , solar is needed."
BIG SHORT SQUEEZE ON Chinese stocks like BABA BIDU JD JKS DQ DIDI NIO XPEV LI and BA!
So did big money just bet on Jinko missing earnings and now they are pushing the price down? Odd how a company can beat earnings estimates by 655% and go down. Also odd that every headline attempts to turn such an earnings beat into a bad thing.
"MASSIVE DISASTER... Year over year revenues FELL 6.2%, while year over year EPS FELL 10.2%... JUNKO has NEGATIVE GROWTH... they produce more and sell LESS IN REVENUES & PROFITS... while the MASSIVE DEBT IS SKYROCKETING.... 20 BILLION IN DEBT NOW.... Interest expense is SKYROCKETING... Junko bankrupt in 2023..."
now what to buy at @ 47.05 usd ? or not to buy to wait for lower price ?
Next year at this time $100
"All quiet on the western front.... Chinese solar stocks close to record highs. The ones trading in US, variable valuations."
Today rebound?
I predict Jinko will get back to test around 48.6 to 46.8! That's the point to buy it again.
Jinkosolar is ahead of its competitors in diversifying the supply chain to avoid getting caught up in the ongoing trade dispute. Its future- forward approach includes signing polysilicon supply deals with Wacker and building up wafer plant in Vietnam.
And Pat just made another $9k in 2 days :)
"funny, every time jinko spikes we hear more unsubstantiated forced labour claims against jinko. No evidence connecting Hoshine, nevermind jinko's supplier Germany's Wacher Chemie. This seems like more of the Gordon Johnson mis-information bs."
"As I said, this is a trading stock. No big dream!"
CSIQ is now GREEN!
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"

Someone knows when Jinko listing in Shanghai?????
"crazy how it got bought up to $55.99 and then big sellers came in! Just hold your shares...you will be glad :). No reason why this is not >$70....i mean it is one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world, now has partnership for storing energy...and have you seen in how many countries JKS SELLS???? this is worth much more than a $2B market cap.....geesh there are companies with much higher valuations that do not have nearly as much potential and do not have nearly the revenue or profit (will be much more once jinko can get expenses down)!"
"$1.43B for CSIQ beating by a wide margin what Jinko had in revenue. Canadian used to be way behind Jinko in revenue. CSIQ more than doubled YoY quarterly revenue. Trina, LONGI, JA Solar the same. Jinko is just at the same levels as last year. Something is not going well with Jinko. I'm getting very nervous about my retirement baby..... Why are they not able to grow revenue like everyone else is when they were #1 module supplier just a year ago for a number of years???"
I have seen it crashing before too and then it resurrects itself like a phoenix! Its fundamentals are solid. I sold juicy Puts today.
Doomplayer clearly a 
"At $52, up 40% from Aug 19 low of 37.32. That's 40% in two weeks. And down 42% from 64.76 Jul 22 to 37.32. That's what we call volatility :) Whacky stock...."
Now...Oversold
JinkoSolar Holding is up 12.73% to 50.11
"Funny, instead of shorts getting progress on tariffs for imports from vietnam and malaysia they get IPO update... ouch. Will be interesting now that judge asked the anonymous requesters to name themselves."

Back $60 if you look at DQ CSIQ SPWR FSLR....
Good news! Going up in pre-market!
Hold!
JKS on the way to $60.
The price is reacting to the star market listing. But people don't seem to be talking about the massive energy shortages in China and the EU. That's going to have a positive effect on demand for alternatives.
Is that market cap on yahoo finance accurate?
"Shorts have gone from 200k shares to 600k shares in the last day... and we still went up 3%! This is normally the most they'll sell short. If we hold, the stock will swing up 5-10% in the next four days as they cover."
they move that stock like a piece of furniture
The Chinese stocks are being taken apart. just unbelievable!
Sleep today. There will be a higher price tomorrow.
"Never know these days with earnings. But I did grab some before close, I do like this company short and long"
"Days like these, one needs some good news. Blackrock, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley and other big players have been loading up on Jinko. That's probably what helped us longs get out of that hole at $29.... Enjoy the weekend!"
"Focusing on the fourth quarter results, relative to consensus expectations, shipments and revenues were better and gross margin was also higher. So why are the results disappointing if you remove all the one time write-offs of obsolescence in plant and equipment and impairment in value of a solar project (which added $50 million to operating costs), and you eliminate all the “mark to market” noise created by the change in value of derivatives surrounding the convertible debt, then the item that stocks out like a very sore thumb in costs is SHIPPING. Yes the cost of shipping has more than doubled in the last few months and they were not able to pass it to their customers, perhaps for contractual reasons.But again, this is a short to medium term phenomenon, a legacy of the disruption caused by the pandemic."
The insiders have told us that JKS will have good margins going down the road. They didn't buy up 26% of JKS so they could put up over a third of what JKS made by selling stock. JKS is going to be making so much money they never have to sell stock again. JKS is going to go up a lot.
Bankruptcy fears are alive and well. No one can pay down $28 B debt.
SAVA is OVERSOLD - FYI
I think it is exaggerated
I’ve owed jinko for awhile now . Jinko bells Jinko bells and all that. I have to admit with this stock being Chinese owned it’s alittle but suspect. I’m not a hundred percent satisfied with this stock. Someone is pulling the strings on the largest producer.....
Must own JKS DQ BABA BIDU for life guys!
"Jinko is aiming to ship over 10 GW in modules in Q4, basically doubling revenues from third quarter to excess of $2.5 billion. Earnings could be well over $1.50 in Q4. Yes the company has disappointed in the first half of this year, but this is not the time to give up."
"With the CATL deal, JKS will now become one of the big players in the energy storage business. Nice!"
"Xi initiative and international boycott will puch this to Single digit, if not bankruptcy !!"
"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (JKS) stock skyrocketing in premarket, here’s why? https://goo.io/investorsobserver.com"
Pre - market 52.50 ;)
"AHAHAHAHHAHA How the f is possible? This is a 300$ stock, low market cap, what a barca in. JKS and CSIQ will make me rich in five years"
Haha. Put your seatbelts on! 
Wowwwwwww
Why going down also today?
look a book value of 220 something strange what holds down this sp.
