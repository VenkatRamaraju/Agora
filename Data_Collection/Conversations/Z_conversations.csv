Just Bought in at 104.90
Getting closer to my target range. :)
Did you buy @ $200 per share? Gee too bad
Wow. My active trader over shorted tracker just popped Zillow up on it's radar. Haven't looked at this one in a year or more and glad to see it's in the top 5% of over shorted stocks on a ecometric basis. Bought in and if my tracker is right will make 5% by tuesday!
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Rising rates. $50 is coming.
"October is the 4th quarter, hope for better fortune"
How the P/B went down to $4 ? are our stocks worth now $4 per company book value and would receive that price if the company were to be liquidated ?
Gotta admit the downward pressure on this is pretty impressive. I keep adding the more it drops. We'll see how dumb I look 5-10 years from now.
no joke this and $U trading at the same price the past few days. Algos tied to these both
"Been accumulating shares of Z today. Hoping that this is the bottom. Next leg down is $89, but I can’t imagine it will go that low. But I will load the truck if it does."
Look at the volume!
"Quite interesting. Anyway, finally got to a price I could start a long position."
New to zillow stock. When is a good time to buy? Will it go lower?
Don’t not sell. It’s a blowout earring and guidance is strong. It will be green tomorrow. Add more today
"Looking out a couple of years, Zillow is an absolute steal below 100.You will see Z above $ 250.Thank you God !"
im just curious. which one is better between Opendoor and Zillow??????
This stock is paper at the bottom of the bird cage. Down 56% YTD. Better off burning your cash to heat your home than buying this.
"Couldn’t wish for a better end for the week.Cheers, fellow shareholders."
The Everything Rally is coming!
Cathie is manipulating everything. Sell before her to $50.
soon we will get into snp 500
Bought 4000 shares of Z at close on Friday. $101.15. We shall see….
This dog lost 51% the last 6 months. Line the bottom of your birdcage with the stock certificates.
"Did a nice reversal today, considering the red market. I think it has completed its head and shoulders. Will prob consolidate for a while before another shake out before the next run."
Should I buy Z or ZG
Should I buy more of this?
"I luv Zillow for making money from the real estate business. But I'm not crazy about them buying and selling homes. Is this the problem with the stock? That when the real estate bobble pops, they'd be the last one holding the bag?"
"Zillow has come to prominence so quickly as a disruptive force because customers are looking for alternatives to the traditional residential transaction where 2 agents claiming to represent their clients merely pander to a closed transaction which in most cases leans towards the buyer's favor. So with fewexceptions the agents cave to the buyer. Now with the market being tight nationwide the traditional lazy #$%$ agents that still try to get 5-6% for just participating and going thru the motions of a listing and sale, are suddenly complaining about big bad Zillow and others ruining their gravy train. I have sold several homes and never liked the structure and manner of a traditional deal, whey the agents engage you in a game of cat and mouse for months and try to manipulate the price and fees to the benefit of the buyer. The market was screaming for a change, now the got one and a big one - and suddenly the agents and traditional brokers are fuming. If I am a seller, I don't give a damn who buys my home, just so I get good money, quick clean close and no rat race along the way - like all the BS feedback on centralized showings and other services that buyer try to use to negotiate with seller without having a contract on the table. Glad to see this sweeping change coming across the industry, and traditional agents/broker are going to have to lower their commissions and fees for the COMMODITY they offer - just like every other person and enterprise in the world. You have to find a way to do more for less, or you are gone.... period. When I hire an agent, I simply want to pay for quick sale of my home, that's all. Not looking for a 'lavish experience' or 'white glove treatment' or a 'rock star pal', no I just need the damn home sold and for a good price with low fees and commission - nothing else."
"too low to sell, but this could be tax loss for year against capital gains, then never come back again to this misery"
"sell Zillow and buy OPEN , the winner in the ibuy marketCompared to zillow Open is undervalued. with only 12B of market cap compared to 27 of zillow. but open sell double compared to zillow."
possible snp 500 inclusión?
zillow is underwater all over the place...price cutting like mad
I use Zillow to list my rental homes when one comes available. This use to be free for me but they now charge $9.99 per week I have the home listed. Really it only takes 1-3 days to get hundreds of applications so I’m completely fine with paying for this service. I’m also impressed Zillow does the background check and credit check and has the applicant upload current paystubs. It could not be a easier process. I give Zillow two thumbs up. I took a small position a few months ago but plan on making a much larger investment this week. Good luck longs!!!
"I hope Zillow turns real estate agents into things of the past....like the PC did to the typewriter, and the phone did to the Kodak camera."
Tough to watch this get beaten down week after week. I’m a long haul investor here but it tests your patience.
Z is poised to crush estimates with a blowout quarter and guide higher when they next report.Do not let this weakness in stock price shake you out. You’ll repent in a few weeks if you sell now.
Hoping by Friday will be 115 I know I am dreaming sometimes dream comes through
"Good profit, but EBIDA's forecast of $ 94 million in the third quarter fell from $ 183 million. It should continue to decline to $ 80-70."
Excited to see how their earnings match up vs. EXPI
"Buying more, it will rise to 150 next week"
All negative people on this board must be Real Estate Brokers that know they will no longer be needed anymore. Zillow has streamlined buying and selling homes. Big things are coming so load up while the shares are cheap. Zillow will bust thru and do over 2 billion this quarter. Long and Strong
Started a position today! 
Ok I’m starting a position in $Z soon the share price is looking tasty! Zillow will be a beast a market leader
"Buying little by little, nothing I can't afford to lose. We will see. Potential for this company to be transformative is significant and worth the risk. Made same bet with Tesla and that paid off. Could flame out this time, certainly wouldn't put my life savings into it, but massive returns over next decade is a definite possibility."
same old #$%$ 1 dollar up and 1 dollar down over and over
Just remeber it’s got to shake out the weaklings and margin holders first before it can slowly rise again
Methinks Zillow bottomed a few days ago...
Is it a miss? Looks like a slight beat. Still waiting for more info...
"I see that Zillow has a bad reputation and that makes me very skeptical:Why do Realtors hate Zillow?One of the main reasons that realtors hate Zillow, is the issue of inaccurate information. And this issue also affects buyers. ... The more listings they have on their site than their competitors, the more realtors that they will attract. And this means more advertising money for them."
Zillow $ZG $Z is insanely cheap folks. Trust me when I tell you that this stock will come roaring back by the end of the year. $130+
Zillow starting to look like a bag holder to me. Can’t help but to hold tight. I’m not selling a dime.
possible HUGE short squeeze at HEXO 12 percent short interest and at 52 week lows!!!
I though $105 was low. Because I bought a position at $105.45. But not planning to sell a single stock.
Dear Zen - Would it be possible to double check with God what he meant by a rapid rise to 120+? Did God mean continental drift fast like the time it takes to create a mountain or like in the next couple of weeks?!?
"I have seen growth companies rise 10% from weaker earnings reports and guidance than Zillow's, even with expected higher costs from reinvestment in the business factored in. This one's a keeper."
I see rock solid bottom @35 ! It's going down big time !
"Mamma Mia, today was a nice day "
the bottom still on the way $57 . don't be happy too early.
"5B revenue with 5B cash on hand this Munster also has 10B visitors per year, next step they do air b&b listings"
zillow is getting slaughtered in arizona...upside down on practically every home purchased in the last 2 mths
This is brutal
"Love seeing green. Cheers, fellow shareholders."
5M shares traded just to gain 2 bucks. Only 1M shares needed to lose 2 bucks.
The market always scare off the weaklings before earnings season.
+4% on no news with high volume. Looks like institutional buying to me. Maybe we’ve reached a bottom. Or at the very least institutions consider this to be a good entry price
"You know who's the biggest bag holder of Zillow? Auntie Cathie! When Arkk funds stops loading the bags, the stock price just drops like there's no tomorrow. Another Ponzi scheme in the making."
Sell to $50. Rising rates and housing crash is coming.
"they want to play games, we know the company makes money, ok lets start with wave 1 of 5 up first slow and steady and let the EWT play out, if you panic and sell then this is not for you"
Finally a bust a nut day.
I bought my first position at 97..am I doing the right thing?
"$Znog shares cheap, news due, Could be oil, Pr anytime! $Znog"
This is the time to buy
This is turning into a very poor investment for me.
waiting for 83-85 range to buy-in.
Bought big at $103
1.3b rev and 10m net profit
"Where are all the people talking about how all awesome it was that this seemed strong (for a little while) on Monday when the market dumped. More importantly, where are all the analysts who were falling over each other to upgrade and raise price targets when this was substantially higher? Crickets now. They LOVED it at $200 but don't have any opinion at $94.00. Haha. Sell side analysts are not your friend."
Such a fun ride
$MCFE. special cash dividend of $4.50 per share
"ZG share price has trickled down, but it’s volume has as well. The weak hands have sold out, and I expect ZG’s share price to climb after earnings. Just placed a limit order for more shares."
Was that the bottom today? Nice reversal!
Z Analysts price targets$215$185$175$153
Something is fishey about this stock.
"Zillow predicts its first $2 billion quarter and blows away earnings expectations, but stock sinkshttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/569636f5-adf3-369a-bf41-04fd62456d17/zillow-predicts-its-first-2.html"
Short squeezing today
Why doesn't this stock have any gas in the tank?
$65 before end of year.
Some other «finance” site was calling for a 50% more drop for Z in one article last week and “a great opportunity to buy” in another article a few days before. I wrote a comment that they were all over the place but they did not post it.
Zillow is making home unaffordable for working people. this company is enemy number for working americans hoping to buy a home one day . this is the amazon of realestate trying to monopolize homes. impovershment of america switched to new gear
i think it was just a misplaced sentiment..this was a great opportunity to buy..i added 300 more in the last 3 mins of trading
"These guys had a virtual MONOPOLY on the space for at least a decade and still couldn't ever make an profits. It is a bad business (hence the huge pivot to an even worse business), and no, Amazon is not going to buy them."
"It’s a long term hold stock. This is not a cyclic stock but a secular growth stock. Stick to it. Whenever it dips, add more. But you gotta hold it for at least a year though."
"I never thought we would break below 90. I’m sitting on 6000 shares with my last purchase at 110. I’m still up over 200k, but definitely don’t like this price action. I’m holding tight for now, but I’m not adding until the sentiment changes. I’m still a believer in this company long term."
Wow 
Zillow is having the path to becoming the #1 real estate company in the world. It should be a trillion dollar business. How it is 25B.
I repeat $50 is coming.
2 Billion dollar quarter but that will generate half the net revenue compared to the 600M revenue from the year ago period. That's why this stock has been a shipwreck. How do you make more money but profit less?
Why there are two symbols Z and ZG?
no joke zillow is buying homes fixing them up and listing them 2 weeks later for LESS than they bought them...its crazy
"low volume means nothing, it is not going down because it has hit bottom after a 50 % sell off !"
"This was ""free money"" to short at $200/share. Just wait until every sell side analyst on the planet is throwing one ridiculous price target after another and that is always the EXACT time to short. At $45/sh. this was expensive in a non-bubble market."
Below $85 next week .
Mortgage foreclosure moratorium is now expired. Thousands of foreclosed houses will soon be listed for sale with Z. This stock is about to pop
what a steal. congrats to all buyers.
"With ZERO to back up my claim, I think they crush it and we are at 150 by year end! GLTA longs"
"""Not a single inside buying transaction aince 2019."" Say no more."
Well guess what. I just confirmed Zillow has put all home buying on hold until next year. This information was for all of Florida so far... Hmmmmm Three clients I have received phone calls from Zillow today to cancel their appointments.
$2B in sales $2B loss in market valuation. That sure makes #$%$ sense
Holding long & strong !
You know a stock has strength if it has holding power in a bad market. I see it gaining more strength in the next 6 months
It took only 2 weeks to go from 130 to 200 back in Jan ‘21
You can’t do nothing about market sentiment . I’m still here to let you know this is undervalued . And in the real estate tech industry this is a huge opportunity to put capital to work and realize some gains in the short-medium term! Be paytient;)
Feb 17 2020 Z hit $65 and now stands at $99 after multiple growth quarters. So in a year in a half we’re only up a little over 50%. I’m very happy to be in at these levels and everyone else should feel good too. This company beats every quarter too! Price will catch up folks!
"feel sorry for those who bought at the peak. ""Gee, too bad"""
"those on margin and the timid longs have sold, now the turn around maybe or a dead cat bounce ?"
i bought the fvvk out of this ah in 105's
What’s the difference between Z and ZG??
"This company is the future of real estate (limitless TAM), foward p/s of 3-4, down 57% from ATH, highly profitable business model long term, I don't understand bears on this one, are they bearish on innovation and real estate? This is the clear leader in online real estate, easy long-term gains. Short-term, who knows but long term, this stock will do just fine. Think about it, you're paying 21B for the FUTURE of real estate..."
52 week low and market near all times highs! Insane
"$Znog Shares cheap, news due, Could be oil, Pr anytime $Znog"
Still seeing no info to suggest anything other than a solid earnings report. Are you guys just basing this on after hours price movements? Kind of meaningless unless you're a short term player.
116 before earning 130 after earnings and then to 150 and above
Loaded up for long. Now let's see this $2 billion quarter
a simple search on zillows own site will foretell a horrible quarter. underwater on many many listed homes...
we will join snp 500 this year.
"CAPITULATION on Z...expect huge rebound from now on, INTEREST RATE ZERO, rush hunting mortgage loan start in Q4 now. Z is back above 200. The more buy accumulate, the more explosive the short squeeze become. Z 200 is conservative. EPS/revenues were met consistently . HEgdies game will be toast soon."
"Yeesh. I'm taking a beating here. Still a believer, though. I keep buying small amounts as this thing craters. What can I say...I'm addicted to losing money."
Trending up. Keep it up. Short party is over. Get ready for your hangover
what should the pe be on a 5% margin business? not 168
No bottom before $50.
"Hope we can hold this level until earnings, and future guidance."
For some reason the CEO’s job is still secure after losing over 20B
Zillow chart analysis 07/15/21https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoxcCKZyuAg
Josh Brown said Z looks like a good buy. That was when it was close to $100 a share.
See you at 60$
Getting cheap
Zen there's a chance you misread gods message
"Do not sell! This puppy has tons of room left to run! We have seen this climbing effortlessly into the $200 range, this level is a huge bargain."
I think this is still an opportunity to get in before it's too late. It will be up a lot tomorrow.
"I’ve seen it over and over again. When I see the bears desperately shouting about the coming doom and sinking prices, it’s time for the stock to run up. Here we go."
"Enough room here to maneuver a 35% pop in typical wall st fashion, because that's what they do, lol!"
I actually think rotation from mega cap to small caps to hold this thing up from selling off...
Just doubled down my position in Z. Feel great for such a terrific bargain.
"Bought 4,000 shares at $89.75 - easy money"
I will continue to buy on these down days. Thanks for the sale prices….looking forward to the next 5 years!
"I hope this wouldn’t turn into another Fastly. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t sell a share during times like today."
Blows away estimates with $2Billion in Revenue this quarter.This will run up in due time. Get in on the dip.
The Brown Bottom is in .. up from here again!
It is very far to bottom yetbottom below $60 ( $57 )
97.36 is resistance level. Z showing strength. Let’s hope it punches through!
Terrible results - my condolences.
This is the worst performing position in my portfolio.Do you shorts hope to push it back to the $20+ range?
The stock value is not more than $59.96. Waiting patiently …
Sell more so I can BUY BUY
Just remember why you bought in the first place
what do you guys think about the PE ratio of this company?
Holy moly I think we hit bottom. Lots of support today. It should double by year’s end
US JULY HOME SALES: 5.99M VS. 5.83M EXPECTED . HOUSING MARKET IS HEALTHY
"I believe Ivy Zellman. I also believe it’s an indefensible reach for a software company to be buying houses in an inflated market over list. This will not end well, and it won’t even take a crash. Out and hoping for dead cat bounce to aggressively buy puts."
Slow march to 250 has started!
"it looks like in the absence of volume the entire at-home tech universe is being shorted week after week.I dont know what the end game is though because almost all of them (Zillow, roku, tdoc, hood, hims, vroom, ) have incredibly nimble and SAAS flywheel business models that will print cashflow for 2 decades. a lot like Adobe already showed us really in the design world. I'll never understand the timing of these things, because we just hit 1000 deaths a day in the US."
z should turn
Housing permits rising in recent data. Fed will likely not be able to raise rate beyond 1% at least until 2025. My bet is 10 year interest rate will be at 1% the highest. Government officials are addicted to vote buying policies which force the fed to keep interest rate low. Also ending tapering is an opportunity for ibuying because this group of landlords will want to sell their house ASAP and selling to ibuying companies like zillow and opendoor are their best bet. THat increases margins for ibuying.
1538 shares @ 103.43 long hold for me 3-6 months first PT 170
Nice to see a short term trend reversal today.
It would be nice to see $108 by Friday. I can see that Zillow has strengthened their quality of service after starting charge weekly fees.
"Last 6 month net shares sold - 352,507Even at this price no one at zillow is buying so why should you"
I told you so. 24 hrs ago I predicted this and gave you all my condolences. Shame you didn't listen lol
if it hits 89 I expected a big buyer coming in on that level
Finally long and strong today
Bye bye 80s
$Z $ZG going to $125+ before year end. Be patient and we'll be rewarded. They are THE market leader. End of story.
Don’t panic guys find the opportunities the market gives you and believe in yourself. When there is chaos there is chance.
Looks like a bottom tail formation if it keeps close to it’s opening price. The downtrend may be reversing
Alright it’s bust a nut time. Finally in the green zone
My algorithms still say a bottom between $75-$90. I have been saying this for many months as the stock got too over valued.
Feels like most of the sellers have left the trade. Volume is down significantly and we’re trading sideways. Just need buyers now!
I bought more
Good rebound here for short term move back over $100
"Gap up during trading! Very bullish, algos are choking!"
"I have said all along I think this stock is worth $75-$90 and that would still give it a premium valuation. Zillow's price got ahead of itself, but the future is bright."
This is gonna pay for my Audi TTRS
"I dunno, but I sure wish ida sold at $150, it's become a dawg. I need to be in stuff going up, not flatlining or worse, down. sigh"
"Curious for why people are bullish on Zillow. Full disclosure, I'm holding 184 5/15 Z 25p. The Bear Case:1.) Their most profitable division (iBuying) is shut down. This made up more than half of their revenue in 2019. At it's best it was marginally profitable - $50M on $1.37B of revenue, during the same period ending 12/2019 they lost $300M overall. 2.) They are sitting on around 1850 homes they likely cant sell right now, are paying carrying costs on, and might sell at a loss if home values do not continue to rise. 3.) They are cutting their fees for realtors/lenders (I'm a lender) and these professionals are cutting their marketing $. I partner with a realtor, we cut it 25% a few weeks ago. 4.) Home sales are down temporarily, but we're also going to see a ripple through housing for months to come - mortgage lenders are estimating that 1/3 - 2/3 of the mortgages in forbearance will result in defaults. 5.) Homes have become harder to buy in as mortgage lending standards contracted significantly in the last 2 months. We went from dozens of loan programs to agency & govy. No more non-QM, no jumbos, nothing but vanilla. FICO score requirements are up, self-employed and gift fund guidelines are now fairly restrictive. Point is, in my estimate 20-30% of people out there are no longer eligible for a mortgage. 6.) They have ALWAYS had negative EPS and it has been growing year over year for 3 years. 7.) They have 2.4B in cash and short-term assets. But...$2.6B in debt (of which, $1.5 is long-term). So what is the bull case? Sure - it's where everyone goes to look up a home. I do too. That doesn't mean it's a profitable company, even at it's best it never has been. Is the assumption that they are still a startup after 14 years and the stock price is speculative? That they will take over the real estate world one day by replacing realtors and lenders? When is that - another 14 years?"
I have a feeling it’s going to be a bloodbath tomorrow afternoon after the earnings report
I got some @ 97 that I wouldn’t sell for 200.
Back to $120 end of year.$220 next year!
"ARKs Cathy Woods just bought 94,576 Shares"
"Due to the inflation in prices of construction goods, I think rentals should benefit for a short period of time. I’m new in investing in real estate business. Opinions are very welcomed."
"Interesting. So far, I haven’t found any explanations for today’s movements but perhaps there are none."
So higher interest rates lead to less purchases on real estate and equates to less profit. When does this catalyst become priced in?
Mind explaining to me how this is only up $1 after hours after that report and guidance?
Comes with best earning on Thursday then #$%$ed mutual fund take it down 9 points just #$%$ it business
"Everyone, understand how the Market works. This is a leading indicator. That said, the stock moved up for six months prior to the good earning report, expecting good news within six months. Now it is moving down expecting the next six month will not be so good. You are in a bad situation if you purchased above $110.00."
Bought my first Zillow stock today. Ive been eyeing this stock for a while and waiting for a strong earnings turnout to justify buying in. Now a blowout earnings report AND an 8% discount on the same day?? I‘m in!!
$130 by tomorrow
I'll pick some up around $35 in 3-4 months. Watch this space.
$ZG under $100. What is going on... I can't believe more people aren't buying into this massive dip we've had on ZG. These guys are crushing it and stock will soon soar to $150 over the next 3-6 months.
Believe it or not we are heading back to the future...the 80s
SO how did everyone like that Friday options expiry price manipulation?
Zillow was a Josh Brown Pick months ago.He said we might actually get to buy Zillow under 100.I bought @ 90 for a 2 year hold.
"Such a great close for the week.Cheers, fellow shareholders."
Zillow is up 5.03% to 95.68
Z heading to bankruptcy
This is going to 30. They over pay for homes but now no one is buying them. 30 by March
$Z has been on my watchlist for while now I feel these prices are a good price to build a position upon. Any thoughts or useful articles?
"i believe this is the bottom, it might stay here and between 108 for a while but definitely a long term hold.."
CNBC reported strong beat ... This all looks very impressive to me ... I'm holding here at a minimum and may add also tomorrow ... Key question is can $2b Revenue next QTR be believed ? - if it is ... then this must be a great QTR and guidance ... It will be interesting to see what issues the Analysts have with this Qtr and outlook (IF Any !!) ...
Market is nothing but a joke now.
Institutional selling today. If Z does not turn it around we'll have new 52 week lows in no time...
Mortgage rates fall to lowest level in six months. It a good sign for Z.
Zillow is going to announce the new feature which will kill the real estate brokerage market! 
"I would sell Zillow over 200 and when it hits 300, I’m going to be crying in my beer "
So is it a beat or miss? No info but trading up and down
Home-building sector has boomed well YTD. Let’s hope it will make an impact to this stock once again.
OPAD (OfferPad) 1.9B Cap with 1.9B Revenue
This stock needs a trip this year to $145 or $150 range to stop algos from treating it like a permanent bear issue.
"Finally seeing a downturn on the infection numbers. Hopefully, the real estate industry gets some fresh air."
Forward PE is about 105 but it's earnings has always beaten every quarter by more than 50%. It's true forward PE should be about <50 if you factor in those future earnings beats.
Really starting to look like the formation of a reversal in the downward trend
What a week
I heard about ZG the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
This dog dropped a lot after the CEO said they will have a big 2 billion dollar quarter. Maybe the ceo should say we are losing money instead like the meme stocks then this will rocket
"Weak hands gone, big funds taking over discounted shares"
"Behold, shorties:Buuuuuuuuuuuuuurn. I love that feeling."
"If not due to broader markets weakness today, Zillow is above 100 now! Cathie Wood just bought up this industry disruptor again!"
"Did you buy this at ~$200? Gee, too bad"
1228 shares @108 (common) long PT 200+
The whole market is down. Z will come back. Just be patient.
"After hours Volume 124,000 and shorts volume 1.7 million, hmmmm long way to go, another 50 bucks when they all cover, not including institutional buying"
I hope ya all added some more with the fantastic earnings and guidance when it dipped. Don’t just look at the price action. Look at the reporting. I see it hitting 200 in 6 months
I plan on buying on monday
What’s happening? It’s green?!
will Z touch 130 end of year?
"hello shots, tick tock tick tock....do you want to cover now or 130 hehehe"
"$ZG is so cheap, I had to buy some more. =DSee ya'll at $150+ by the end of the year."
loaded more at 103.65 .. its bounced back a couple.of times from there
"Not a major rise but a green day nonetheless.Happy weekend, fellow shareholders."
people are saying they are manipulating market of real estate to sell home prices 20% higher. so this is going to be some sort of real estate monopoly?  trillion dollar company inc
this has been one disaster of an investment for me. the worst.
CEO has got to go
"I entered at $99 and HODLing until it goes back up to ath, but will keep a third when that happens. Good luck fellow longs!"
"I am selling, and Cathy is buying from 200 !"
"Why is Zillow buying up properties for way above market prices? Here's an example I found on Zillow for a house in southern California.

I was thinking that the everlasting dropping was caused by the buyers’ market but then again there is as well a small inflation in construction goods but then again the latter should only silent the real estate market just a little because - by large and in general - people are sitting on a bigger pile of cash comparing to the pre-pandemic times.I’m new in this business and trying to figure out phenomena.
"I have to say, I love seeing all of the negative comments here. Just kind of makes me feel even more confident in being a long term investor in Zillow. All economic data points to a positive growth in this company and a very bright future outlook for all of the ibuyers"
Please share with me why this stock dropped from 200 to 95 ? I believe this is the ultimate SFH Real Estate Play or at least the google of homes...
So far so good. Nice move for Z today
Is this because with the jobs report they think the fed might start tapering or lifting rates affecting mortgage rates? I can’t think of any other reason why a stock like this would be down 5% after this kind of earnings beat.

"I want to start a position, any longs here that think that this has a little more downside? = should I wait?"
"You know who's the biggest bag holder of Zillow? Cathie Wood! Once she stops purchasing the stock and propping up the price, it keeps tumbling down."
Rising interest rates and still buying Z that's more than 50% off its FEB high? Well Ok.
"don't be too happy till it breaks over 100 with 5 waves and 3 up, otherwise it is going to douch again"
The Force is strong today
Zillow selling houses with less than they bought...
OIL SOON
you got to be happy Yomama !
Sell before Cathy. $50 is coming. Rising rates and aggressive FED.
Do you remember when I said I was short way back and it will go sub $100? It will go even lower as Zillow holds the bag on overvalued real estate in the US. The biggest bag holder of all time. Can't wait for earnings for Q4 2021 next year. Pahahaha

Bank of America Securities sell recommendation what is why today is down.
The problem with inventory is that it’s price is subjective. Inventory can be a asset or liability depending on where the market price for the asset moves.Inventory is subject to interest rate changes.Why do I want to own Z when I can own EXPI who is profitable and the price to revenue is 1/3 of Z
Z will test $79 in this period.
"Next week , Z will find new support $85 first."
The TAM of all the services Zillow provides is 1.9 Trillion. Buy and tuck away for 7-10 years.
both $Z and $EXPI are a bargain. Nows the perfect time to pounce.
If you do not own this go out and buy it. Great company and the price has come down a lot. It's making support here today. I'm in it and I'll be adding to it.
What a quarter! Will be green tomorrow!
102 today . Buy the dip
Zillow price action indicitive of slowing housing market in the future
Is there a reason for this today? Any hope for these good times to continue the next few days?
lost 3K in a week in call options..this one is weird one.. @yuriy you were probably right..
Not amused but I’ll hold at least for the next six months.
holding long term
I'm glad to see shareholders haven't panic sold. Long holding Zillow is a wise choice.
"Z and $ZG own Dotloop, which is the equivalent of $DOCU. With DOCU having a $54B market cap and Z half that you have to wonder what a sum of the parts of Z and ZG might be worth. Seems like a lot more value in Z and ZG plus you get the #1 web site, all their rental platform, mortgage company, iBuyer platform. Seems like a lot of room for Z to run"
