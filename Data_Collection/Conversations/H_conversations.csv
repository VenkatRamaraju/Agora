"Hey Lucas and the rest of you loser shorts, try not to lose too much....total hacks."
"What you IMBECILES at IV are still NOT GETTING IS ..............The fact that NO DATA is coming! Now, next month, next year......EVER! And their is NO DATA coming because NO TRIALS are being run! They are not enrolling ANY PATIENTS and have NOT been doing so! To have a site listed as recruiting is a matter of paperwork. To have a site ACTIVELY ENROLLING patients in a trial takes MONEY! Money the boys don't have and money they will surely not waste on any trials where they already know the outcome.And that outcome will show what i and they already know.......that pv-10/ph-10 ....is a piece of $h*t.....laying in the toilet.......STINKING ......just waiting to get flushed. And very shortly....pvct will get FLUSHED......BY THE SEC.And they will flush YOUR INVESTMENT ( WHATEVER PENNIES ARE STILL LEFT OF IT) DOWN THE TOILET ALSO.There is no data kids.....never will be. Pete Culpable will get on the next CC and tell you that ""spring is coming""......don't matter cause they already pushed the alleged ""data dump"" back into 2018. DDon't matter.....2018 2019.....2199......etc.....still won't be any data.THIS IS A FRAUD FOLKS! IT's that simple. I have told you this since BTD blew up! It is a fraud and you have been had!Your money is gone1 And Petey and the gang are waiting.....hoping......that you will just skulk off into the night and do so quietly. Once they do rthe R/S and dump the rest of the shares onto the mkt.....this p0$ will be pennies again! And this is before the SEC comes to town and shuts this down! Do not go quitely into the night. Their are dozens of class-action law firms who would only be too happy to go after these CRIMINALS on YOUR BEHALF! They will do so in in CRIMINAL and CIVIL court and force these guys into bankruptcy before they are sent to JAIL. But at least you people will have their assets and the co. patents to help offset some of your losses. And you will also have the satisfaction of knowing that these SLUMBAGS are serving long jail terms and that these guys are all being drilled in the can by the whole house!"

"Eric's Dilemma ..............Many on the IDIOTS on the IV board have been hammering away at Eric for his lack of transparency with regard to the disclosure of data. It's true that Eric has not disclosed ANY data in many years. He has only used his 2 online P0$ SLUMBAGS.....aka.....jack@$$ #1 and #2...... to LIE to you about what data lies behind the curtain.The truth is folks......he has NO data! And what little data he has shows that BS-10 and BS(PH)-10 have CLINICALLY MEANINGLESS RESULTS! That is why you get NO RESULTS folks....plain and simple. Couple that with the FACT that he has a fiduciary and LEGAL obligation to disclose materially significant info to investors and you have a man who is committing FRAUD! When regulators match up what is actually going on in the co. with what he has been bull$h*tting investors about in many a CC , HE WILL HAVE CONVICTED HIMSELF OF FRAUD! Why has he not been forthcoming with investors about sites and the # of patients dosed to date? Think that maybe he's only actually dosed a few? And when authorities see that they are promising interim by 2nd q 2016....now 4th q 2016.......then by 1st q 2017.....and then match up the fact that they are LIGHT YEARS FROM PROVIDING INTERIM.......while they do their 3 raise since promising interim........he will have CONVICTED HIMSELF OF FRAUD by his very own words and actions. This will land the whole team in JAIL for many years. He has also CLAIMED on many occasions that there are sites up that are not disclosed. Really Eric?......where? You also have sites ""open"" but have yet to supply with BS-10 MANY MONTHS AFTER THEY LISTED THEMSELVES AS ""RECRUITING""......WHY IS THAT ERIC?.....Is it because you don't have ANY intentions of spending that kind of money doing a useless trial whose results you already know are insignificant? Yup......I think so. And the reason they will not run this trial is because this trial will cost an ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY........MONEY ALREADY EARMARKED FOR SALARIES,BONUSES, 401-K MATCHES, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, VAC PAY, ""EXPENSE"" ACCOUNTS.....ETC......You see folks....they are not running ANY trials....these sites are listed as ""recruuiting"" simply to create the illusion ...for you.... that they are actually progressing toward ""results""....when if fact it is done merely to intice investors to throw more money into the cash draw.Money that will ultimately be STOLEN by the shed team in the form of salaries,bonuses, 401-k matches, expenses, unused vac pay, pension contributions......etc.......THIS IS A SCAM FOLKS......A SCAM!"

"Well I see the shed team is at it again ......appointing Dombag and ...........another shady lowlife as ....ahem...."" special advisers to the Company's Board of Directors""......LMAO. There job, according to the press release, is to "" advise the board on financial and corporate strategy"". .....LMAO. This is really funny.....and really pathetic.You have to ask yourselves why the boys would do this at a time when this sham is about to end. In the past I have documented DOMBAG'S ""work history"" by pointing out how he CLAIMS to have all these degrees from top notch programs yet he has NEVER worked longer than 1 1/2 yrs. at any of these shell companies he CLAIMS employment with and does not hold a sec. license nor has he ever been registered as a RIA. Hmmmm....surely is you are employed as an inv. advisor .....woudln't u need these lic. to conduct your ""business""? .....You bet you would. And why is EVERY co. HE HIMSELF LISTS as being employed with always just a shell co. ?.....why not a merrill lynch.....or any other REPUTABLE SEC. FIRM?.......Hmmmmm....think there might be more to it?.... And how about our latest friend Mr. Bruce Horowitz?.....to whom the PR describes as a "" independent consultant for Provectus for more than a decade"".....wow...where did he come from? Who hired him? How much was he paid? What did he do for pvct? My guess? He is one of those ""paid marketeers"" we have known to be long associated with this firm My guess is that Craig hired him to attend those seminars they put together for gullible crowd.....where these predators were let loose in the crowd to work their magic and get the crowd to invest in this p0$ co. They were then paid ...on the sly,......with warrants ....which they then turned around and sold. And if you look at this guys ""work history"" that theory sounds spot on, He like DOMBAG.....has an interesting work history. Observe.....Managing director at Capital Strategists llc.......aka....a shell co. HE SET UP , ran out of his house and is MO LONGER ACTIVE.....Hmmmmm. Next we find he "" managed the equity trading department at Laidlaw Equities ""......yet a check check at broke check shows no such person has a sec. license.Hmmmmmm. Moving right along, the PR states...he was a senior vp at "" Drake Capital Securities,""......funny I can't find ANYTHING about the co. or any mention he was ever there.......Hmmmmm. These firms are listed in NY yet his last co. is listed in Cali where is claims he lived for 25 + yrs. ....Hmmm.... The only ny area Bruce horowitz I show was one who started up "" MASSIVE ABUNDANCE"".....established in 2006 in ny and developed trading systems but was indicted by Mass. regulators for taking investor money. Is it the same Bruce Horowitz?......I don't know but I bet it is. So this begs the question......why bring 2 more shady characters with questionable backgrounds with the co. a month or 2 from folding up?......My guess....they are bringing these guys in to keep them within the corp litigation ""umbrella"". By doing so they will be sued in the corp. entity and not as individuals. Pete Culpable.....by getting himself $h*tcanned......lost that critical protection and you IDIOTS can now feel free to sue the $h*t outta him in both civil and criminal court. Why do you think this dope is so desperate to get back in?.An independent forensic ACC. firm determined that he STOLE 295,000 THOUSAND DOLLARS LAST YEAR. and this bozo has the balls to turn around and try to retake the co. This is truly amazing when you look at the cast of characters associated with this firm. Craig, Petey, DOMBAG, vorlon, Brucie, Al. e. Neumann.......etc....etc.....etc...... Getting the pic now folks?"

"Why you IDIOTS need to vote NO and NO.............. The 1st reason is pretty obvious....your money is gone and this p0$ will be flushed down the toilet shortly. The sooner you IDIOTS realize that the better off you will be. You can then move on to the CRIMINAL and CIVIL aspects of this CON and have your day in court. The only DIGNIFIED thing for you people to do now is to make sure that these CRIMINAL P0$ get what they deserve for this MASSIVE CRIMINAL FRAUD.......ASSET CLAWBACKS AND LONG JAIL TERMS! Ther second reason to vote NO and NO is also pretty obvious. You hero's entered into an ILLEGAL financing arrangement with boiler room shop called Maxim. They got financing on the basis of having to issue share that they are LEGALLY NOT ABLE TO DO. Think of that for a moment. To do this ratchet LEGALLY one would need to have enough share authorization AHEAD OF TIME in order to enter into such a contractual obligation. PVCT had no such authorization. Now that it is apparent that they don't have enough shares to cover the full ratchet.....the boys have turned to you IDIOTS for the authority to make this ILLEGAL financing arraingment whole. If you fail to vote the share bump ...this fin. contract will not be able to be fullfilled and the boys will be in the LEGAL DUNGEON. The company will be in default and will be shut down. And the avalanche of lawsuits that will follow will be staggering. Besides, why would you allow a mgmt who dosen't give a $h*t abot you...to enter into an ILLEGAL fin. deal that forks you own a hole.....then turn around and ask you to bail them out LEGALLY by giving them a share that will screw you and keep them out of legal hell. Heads they win....tails you lose. Bottom line! 3rd reason. Most of the idiots on IV think PVCT will fetch 2 to 4 billion in auction......LMFAO. If that is the case then why vote the s\hare bump? Why not force the auction now take you 4-5 dollars a share and put this wreck in the rear mirror?Vote the share bump and 6 months from now when they auction this p0$ off you'll be sharing the auction price with 1 billion shares instead of 400 million......badly diluting your final take. Makes no sense to vote give them a share bump. Unless od course , you IDIOTS already know that this p0$ will not fetch anything at auction and your just pulling each others peckers with this BS. Truth is folks....this worthless p0$ is ALREADY TRADING AT AUCTION......JUST LOOK AT THE PRICE.....6 cents. Any BP could take this p0$ TODAY FOR NEXT TO NOTHING. Why don't they you ask?....Because they know....and have always known the following......that this co. is a p0$.......that bs-10 is a red industrial dye with no cancer fighting properties and that the SLUMBAGS running this co. are CONMEN!"

Observe the latest BS from that worthless p0$ Vorlon....."" Got first hand birdie singing from those priveldged to be talked to today. Co development deal on combo likely before P3 interim. Three pharmas interested in PH-10."".......LMFAO... This is too funny. Not only is ALL of this BS but it is also LIBELOUS! I have no birdies folks but I can tell you for sure that the shed team has no deals ANYWHERE. BS(PH)-10 WAS SCRAPPED YEARS AGO! That is why no more money was thrown down that rabbit hole since 2009. Combo deal?....lmao......they arn't anywhere near interim and arn't even running trials anymore due to the LACK of ANY MONEY! Who told you all these wonderous tidbits Vor-on?.....The 40 shareholders who oen 805 of the stock? The guy from pfe who always tells you noe to reveal their plans for pvct online? Did mgmt tell you this while they were drinking champagne and doing the jig?....Folks this is just another lie in an endless string of lies put forth by this ignorant, worthless,hillbilly p0$ who is PAID by the shed team to LIE TO YOU! Earlier this week , jack@$$ #2 set out the following lies.....that Pete Culpable hels a private meeting with a select few(forget about how ILLEGAL THIS IS), That Wachtell. Lipton is reading the blog and that 2 entities are looking at BS(PH)-10 for acqusition purposes....LMAO! Bottom line is this folks.....the shed team is desperate....very DESPERATE. They need money real bad and as they do EVERYTIME THEY NEED MONEY,....THEY SEND THESE 2 IMBECILES OUT THERE TO TELL YOU ANYTHING THEY CAN TO FOOL YOU IDIOTS INTO BUYING MORE STOCK.And as sure as $h*t stinks, look for a whole array of BS to be passed out to you in the next month to try to pump the stock and get you to buy into the R/S ...rights offering. I urge every shareholder out there that is fed up with the LIES, fed up with their BS to call/contact the SEC and do with I have done.....inform them about the company, Vorlon and DOMBAG. Fax the a copy of their BS blogs and online lies. This is a CON folks. To do so ....GO TO THE SEC WEBSITE- CLICK ON THE COMPLAINT SEC and FOLLOW the instructions. I have faxed them a trove of the lies these 2 CRIMINAL p0$ have posted and when all of you do the same ....these 2 SLUMBAGS will get just what they deserve.....LONG JAIL SENTENCES!"

CIBC continues to sell off using Alternative Markets System and not TSX. These are broker trades for whatever they can get. CIBC investors have given up on HEXO and Candian LPs due to regulatory issues and are moving money to US LPs. They think that Canada couldn't get it right if it tried and that USA is where the opportunity squarely lies.CIBC has by far the largest war chest of HEXO shares to get rid of. They started to sell off after HEXO insiders sold. Expect more carnage in the days to come as it contines the sell off.

Apparently, and according to ol' DOMBAG, these large east coast investors walked away quite impressed with what a lyin, SLUMBAG, P0$, like Pete Culpable had to say. LOL......this is way too funny. This shows just how desperate this lousy p0$ is to try and float such an obvious lie like this out there. Hey DOMBAG.....if their was such a meeting can u at least tell us where this ""meeting"" took place""?. Can u tell u some of who ""allegedly"" attended?. Can you tell us some....even a little....of what was said at this ""meeting""? Of course you can't DOMBAG! You can't because this is just another .....in a very long string......of LIES you have told the IDIOTS on these boards. You vaguely mention that good things came out of this meeting and that all attendies ....who have LOST everything in this p0$ SCAM...all joined hands and sang KUM-BYE-YA.......at all the good news Petey presented ....yet cleverly spin this tale so as not to make yourself libelous for the lie. And that is exactly what this is kids......a lie.....presented by a SLUMBAG PAID LIAR! Ever look at this guys ""credentials"" folks?.....Engineering degree, advanced degrees from Wharton AND MIT?....Very prestigious acdemic credentials for sure. Now look at the work ""history"" this SLUMBAG presents. Notice it's ALL shell investment companies that pop up out of nowhere , then disappear within 1 1/2 yr? Ever notice he has NO sec. licenses and has NEVER been registered as a RIA? Doesn't add up people.....with those academic credentials hes should be able to name his job....and salary. Think maybe.....just maybe.......this guy is full of poopie?.....I sure do. And I truly hope the SEC, and the Las Vegas fraud teams come to the same conclusion because the guys $h*t stinks real bad!"

"Tourism and hotel business;While most listed companies seem to do a fine job keeping both patrons and investor happy, I was surprised to see that WYND (Wyndham Destinations) recently had 6 buy and 7 hold recommendations out of a total of 13 stock analysts. And that Jim Cramer was raving too. It is in fact strange that the NYSE listed companies WH (Wyndham Hotels & Resorts) and WYND (Wyndham Destinations) still uses the name WYNDHAM. They are hotel operators. But they have dumped their properties to a number of Vacation Clubs. I made the mistake of becoming a member of Club Wyndham Access. It cost me 58379 usd . The staff used a hard sell technique during 8 hours and I finally gave up. Afterwards you are left with lies and promises – that are not kept. While the staff disappears and e-mail to their addresses bounce back…When you google on search words like “Wyndham Scams” a flood of dissatisfied people tell their sorry tales. Whistleblowers, who reveal the Wyndham unethical selling technique, have to be paid 20 million usd. The vacations offered and promised are seldom available and extremely expensive. By selling points for member’s cash W. can hide that they simply do not have enough resorts available despite membership payments and maintenance fees that in size can almost match the price of a Florida condo that you can stay in the year around. I wanted to travel to Africa and Asia. Last year I tried Sri Lanka. Wyndham Club and subsidiary RCI have only 5 places on Sri Lanka (but nothing was of course available when I was there). The Club Wyndham currency is called points. A Club Wyndham member like me get 400000 points every year (as a sort of interest on the 58379 usd down payment).Instead, if I invest and get a 5 % interest/dividend on my down payment of 58379 usd, it will give me circa 2919 usd/year.And the Condo maintenance costs for my Wyndham Club membership cost 2632 usd/year. (I have stopped paying it).These 5551 usd will give me and other Club-members a maximum of 27 days of vacation in Sri Lanka. (It cost us 15000 points/night in the few places that are available in Africa and Asia)I used hotel booking site Booking.com instead. They had more than 10000 items to choose from on Sri Lanka. They were mostly close to beach, clean, air-conditioned and with private toilet and bath etc. I paid circa 25 usd/night.This way I could stay on Sri Lanka much longer and in fact get 222 hotel-nights and save the 58379 usd for myself. But Wyndham Club never told me about it, so I wasted 58379 usd. I believe that most people scammed by Wyndham like myself don’t use their services any more. And don’t want to stay in their hotels and their 20 assorted hotel chains. This badwill will hurt WYND and WHs stock market performance. Remember, WYND has a negative booked value of – 6.04 usd/share.

"So Hyatt Hotels will get billions in bailout money, even though the Governor of Illinois, billionaire democrat Pritzkers family, is the largest owner. Meanwhile non of Trumps venues will get a dime. The President, in order to help millions of Americans, sacrificed aid to his own holdings, for the sake of the US, in order to get the bill, stuffed with PBR funding, Kennedy Center money, pension plans for corrupt newspaper editors, and other vast amounts of pork. Imagine how many hungry Americans could have been fed with the millions going to the Kennedy Center, so it can sit empty for 6 more months."

"TY DOPE-ER55.... for posting the laughable Pete Culpable response.....IT PROVES..........what I've been saying all along about these SLUMBAGS........in that, this whole co. was setup to be nothing more that a piggy bank for a group of criminals and their accomplices for the sole purpose of enriching themselves for as much money as they could for as long as they could. Petey doesn't realize it yet but his little addendum to the 13-d is very criminally damning for the whole lot of them. The fact that the shed team shut down their homepage....so as to deny holders access to this info......is very telling .....and very disturbing! In order to get a good understanding of what is REALLY going on here , one must 1st understand that a.) Petey is a pathological Liar and that b.) knowing that, one must carefully sift thru the clumps of $h*t this guy spits out to find the TRUE ....but rare......nuggets of useful info. For ex......Petey says that they were in the process of talking to potential partners regarding production and marketing of PV-10 when it is approved by the FDA,.....LOL.....the key word if is WHEN.....this of course is pure BS......they are in talks with no one! Pharma world recognized yrs. ago that this is a SCAM! 2nd....I love the line where Petey CLAIMS that.the board had...... ""an incorrect belief that I was responsible for monitoring expense accounts""......really Pete? Tell me than....who in a 4 person co. is responsible for this function if not the CFO?.......COMPLETE LIE PETEY.The next LIE in PETEY'S ramble. is this incredibly damning statement....."" the Board never assigned me or any of the other officers any duties."".....WOW..... This PROVES what I've been saying all along about this co.....that it was set up solely as a piggy bank. From Petey's own mouth we see that no corp. responsibilities were EVER give out and never were. WHY you ask?......Because the TRUE purpose of this co. was to raise money....money that was intentially going to be funneled back into the boys pockets via salaries, bonuses, 401-k matches, pension contributions, unused vac. pay, ""expense vouchers""......etc......The rest kids was just for show.....to give shareholders the illusion that progress was being made to get this drug approved. Why do you think they have ALWAYS STEADFASTLY REFUSED to disclose to you where they are in trials? Why do you think NO TIMELINES WERE EVER MET?......SMELL FRAUD YET GUYS?.....there;s more... Petey. goes on to say that an outside audit team says he owes 294,000. WOW! Thats 294,000 UNACCOUNTED FOR DOLLARS.....THIS YEAR!!!!!AMAZING!....Petey then goes on to give us this astonishingly stupid excuse that these foreign restaurants...etc... did not take AMER. EXP.....so he had to use cash......C'mon petey.....this all you can come up with?You don't have a visa?.....really? What Petey than goes on to say is VERY DISTURBING! Oserve "" The non-officer directors have through the years shown little or no interest in Provectus’ business. there had been only one Board meeting, either in person or by telephone. The non-officer directors either had never met Craig Dees,""....WOW! There is NO OVERSIGHT ANYWHERE HERE......from employee responsibilities to director fid. duties.....ANYWHERE.....again this shows/proves my thesis that this co. is a piggy bank! If this isn't troubling enough, Petey gives us the crem de le crem statement......"" And with regard to travel advances to Craig Dees, Provectus’ internal controls specifically stated that I did not have the authority to authorize any expenses, which includes travel expenses incurred by Craig Dees or other Provectus employees.""......WOW.......talk about dropping a BOMB on the shed! He just blew the whole thing to p[ieces here. This , of course, begs the question....who authorized Craigy's ""expenses"" all these years if not you Petey? This statement seems to directly point the finger of blame squarely on Eric and/or Timmy. The inference here is that not only did they approve Craigy's thefts by deception.....they may very well and very likely approved similiar ""travel voucher"" expenses FOR THEMSELVES! And since we know/think that Timmy never does anything maybe it's Eric involved here? WOW!!!!!! Bottom line here folks, is....at best... that they violated EVERY fiduciary responsibility they have to shareholders and well as regulators.....violations that will cost them dearly....as in the doors will soon be shut. At worst.....this is a coordinated fraud , perpetuated on shareholders, that will soon bring not only as avalanche of lawsuits but a long litany of criminal and civil charges!"

"Musings....My former relationship with the former CEO....Craig.....was one where I spent hours and hours and hour performing fellatio on him! All that for drinks and change and a chance to be paid for pumping this stock. His shortcomings are well known.....a boozer, a liar, a FAGler and a criminal.....those shortcomings aside....he was a true genius in the art of embezzlement. I learned so much...an amazing much. He would bounce new ideas off me and vice versa. We would discuss new cons, new pumps into the wee hours of the morning.......then I would jump on and service his knob! He even found a solution on how to bypass my hemmoroids......I'LL save that story for another day. But his health and his dumbass personal misjudgements put an end to what he might have added to his legacy. I draw the line at any theft where I personally don't get any of the bounty from said theft. My lack of ethics prevented me from overlooking that oversight! And I lament that this con is coming to an end! But the background he gave me, and the bangings he gave to my buttocks....allow me to continue his work. He was a giant in the field of lying, drinking and embezzling! I hope I can achieve similiar status with my pumps!It is my utmost unequivocal belief we have the most amazing ongoing and long-term pump in the history of stock market minipulation. Imagine , for 12 + years we have been conning a bunch of fools into believing that a red industrial dye is a cure for cancer.....LMAO. I can't make this $h*t up. And along the way we have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from these very fools and poured each and every one of those dollars into ours and our enablers pockets. Craig is a genius for devising this plot! It will end up the foundation of every con case study going forward. It is the ultimate of pumps. Those on Wall Street who read me should understand this and use the lessons of our con on their clients going forward. You too will become rich by heeding our advice and learning our lessons! Just remember to fold you con and move your money offshore when the heat comes on you. Craig did just that. Pecker, knows this and knows that the heat is now squarely on him and Eric! That is why they hastely thru Craig under the bus. It remains to be seen who the SEC and the FEDS ultimately hang this con on. My biggest fear is that my role as chief pumper becomes known and that I too become a defendant who in the end gets 10+ years in jail. So fellow shareholders, pray for me that I don't get caught in this dragnet......we have kicked butt with the amount of money stolen in this con. Proof of that is in the total amount of money we have raised and stolen since Craig hatched this plot 12 + years ago!"

Hence the combo of convertible's and warrants.......""near"" equities but legally not so in terms of legal ramifications from potential buyers when this p0$ co. goes belly up. The sad thing is how little these clowns tink of long suffering shareholders. They just rubbed your noses in $h*t AGAIN, kids. Follow....they attempting to raise 6 million by issuing 48 million shares ....valuing YOUR shares at 12.5 cents......what an insult to you IDIOTS!And for what? There are no trials going on.

"Question asked over at IV BY...................#$%$_STAR......easily one of the STUPIDEST PUNKS.....on a board filled with some of the world's biggest IDIOTS......question "" Anyone know for certain that PVCT is still recruiting and treating patients with PV-10 or is it completely ceased due to lack of money""?.....REALLY? Your kidding right IDIOT?.....Here is the FYI on that.....Back in Dec of 2016....Eric said in a PR THAT a patient had been treated.......This is pretty funny since all along Eric swore that he would not PR if/when any patient had been dosed or how many. I am quite certain that the PR was announced because it WAS THE 1ST PATIENT ACTUALLY DOSED! And I further believe that this person was dosed in the combo trial! ....I seriously do not believe ANYONE has ever been treated in the p3 trial as yet. And with and alleged 1 million left in the bank........you can rest assured the NO ONE IS OR HAS BEEN DOSED IN QUITE SOME TIME! So all that BS about 20 sites and interim by mid 2017.....is just that....BS! They are light years away from ANY INTERIM RESULTS! And they will never get there! Mark my words......when the lawsuits start to compare all their BS public statements with actual drug development progress( or lack thereof) you will see that this whole thing is a complete pile of #$%$...That's what \is going to sink them deep! Why do you think Eric and gang have ALWAYS STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO DISCLOSE HOW MANY PATIENTS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED....HOW MANY HAVE BEEN TREATED TO DATE IN THE TRIALS.....ETC..... He doesn't because the truth will really hurt and have regulators , prosecutors, legal teams, sec. officals....etc....descending on the barn like locusts!"

Then when these large shareholders pound the stock's yearly RSI down below 30, they miraculously tart to recover? My only question is why does the SEC allow this? And the only answer I can come to is that the SEC is in on the scam. Luckily, I know how the scam works, but every time I see it, Im amazed. Once again, SEC investigated opened.
