"Pretty soon, there will be no hotels to stay in.....smh........the bat flu taking out the entire country. Hyatt has a lot of cash but this is gonna put one hell of a knot on their head."
this stock did not beat s&P500
"Multiple fails 1) The Gate agent should have never allowed the plane to be loaded and then requested that passengers disembark. 2) They had to accommodate united employees who needed to be in Louisville for a shift. Most companies plan ahead better than this -- need to have the right assets in the right place at the right time. 3) We understand that the airlines have a right to ask people to leave but they don't have the right to beat the $h't out of them. 4) Damage control was nonexistent, it the issue wouldn't have blown up in their faces they would have probably pressed charge too boot. Terrible execution by the gate agent, operations, and security. Followed by emotionally blind responses."
I'm just going to wait on the beautiful stimulus package that Trump signs. I may end up buying back higher but too much risk. They just got a DOWNGRADE.

"So Hyatt Hotels will get billions in bailout money, even though the Governor of Illinois, billionaire democrat Pritzkers family, is the largest owner. Meanwhile non of Trumps venues will get a dime. The President, in order to help millions of Americans, sacrificed aid to his own holdings, for the sake of the US, in order to get the bill, stuffed with PBR funding, Kennedy Center money, pension plans for corrupt newspaper editors, and other vast amounts of pork. Imagine how many hungry Americans could have been fed with the millions going to the Kennedy Center, so it can sit empty for 6 more months."

Hyatt now the focus of a boycott for hosting CPAC. Why would any hotel agree to host CPAC? Bad for business.
"Tourism and hotel business;While most listed companies seem to do a fine job keeping both patrons and investor happy, I was surprised to see that WYND (Wyndham Destinations) recently had 6 buy and 7 hold recommendations out of a total of 13 stock analysts. And that Jim Cramer was raving too. It is in fact strange that the NYSE listed companies WH (Wyndham Hotels & Resorts) and WYND (Wyndham Destinations) still uses the name WYNDHAM. They are hotel operators. But they have dumped their properties to a number of Vacation Clubs. I made the mistake of becoming a member of Club Wyndham Access. It cost me 58379 usd . The staff used a hard sell technique during 8 hours and I finally gave up. Afterwards you are left with lies and promises – that are not kept. While the staff disappears and e-mail to their addresses bounce back…When you google on search words like “Wyndham Scams” a flood of dissatisfied people tell their sorry tales. Whistleblowers, who reveal the Wyndham unethical selling technique, have to be paid 20 million usd. The vacations offered and promised are seldom available and extremely expensive. By selling points for member’s cash W. can hide that they simply do not have enough resorts available despite membership payments and maintenance fees that in size can almost match the price of a Florida condo that you can stay in the year around. I wanted to travel to Africa and Asia. Last year I tried Sri Lanka. Wyndham Club and subsidiary RCI have only 5 places on Sri Lanka (but nothing was of course available when I was there). The Club Wyndham currency is called points. A Club Wyndham member like me get 400000 points every year (as a sort of interest on the 58379 usd down payment).Instead, if I invest and get a 5 % interest/dividend on my down payment of 58379 usd, it will give me circa 2919 usd/year.And the Condo maintenance costs for my Wyndham Club membership cost 2632 usd/year. (I have stopped paying it).These 5551 usd will give me and other Club-members a maximum of 27 days of vacation in Sri Lanka. (It cost us 15000 points/night in the few places that are available in Africa and Asia)I used hotel booking site Booking.com instead. They had more than 10000 items to choose from on Sri Lanka. They were mostly close to beach, clean, air-conditioned and with private toilet and bath etc. I paid circa 25 usd/night.This way I could stay on Sri Lanka much longer and in fact get 222 hotel-nights and save the 58379 usd for myself. But Wyndham Club never told me about it, so I wasted 58379 usd. I believe that most people scammed by Wyndham like myself don’t use their services any more. And don’t want to stay in their hotels and their 20 assorted hotel chains. This badwill will hurt WYND and WHs stock market performance. Remember, WYND has a negative booked value of – 6.04 usd/share.

"Trying to sift through the analyst reports for this stock and I don't seem to understand why more people aren't attracted to Hyatt, or why more people aren't talking about the company in general. They have a great members program, are loyal to their customers, but are still trying to make their business profitable for their shareholders. Some people were upset from their slight points devaluation (peak and off-peak point stays), but business is business, and the other major hotel corps do the same thing. Their new business credit card was disappointing, but obviously they don't want to give status away like the other companies. Anyway, I don't have any shares of Hyatt, but am highly considering investing, especially if they keep up their growth/acquisitions post-pandemic. Does anyone have anything to comment or add? Am I missing something here?"

"As a shareholder, I love Hyatt but buying during this is just stupid...this could be closed down another month, revenues will be CRUSHED. If you bought yesterday, you are now down 9%, get used to that sort of volatility until this blows over. Too much risk, talk about making a ""fortune"" if you want, you could LOSE a fortune if this stays closed six months...MUCH better to wait it out as more information gets released. Sure you won't get the best price but you won't lose it all either."

CIBC continues to sell off using Alternative Markets System and not TSX. These are broker trades for whatever they can get. CIBC investors have given up on HEXO and Candian LPs due to regulatory issues and are moving money to US LPs. They think that Canada couldn't get it right if it tried and that USA is where the opportunity squarely lies.CIBC has by far the largest war chest of HEXO shares to get rid of. They started to sell off after HEXO insiders sold. Expect more carnage in the days to come as it contines the sell off.
