"This has been a good buy, glad I didn't listen to all the doomstay news/articles. Last two quarters it's growing, new properties opening; I think it will be fine but it may be a rough ride here within the next month or so."
"Got money to buy all of those properties, then you have money to bring back the dividend..."
"Hotels are closing everywhere. This time last year 70% occupancy rate, now its 5%."
They announce a new hotel every week. What they need to be doing is announcing reinstatement of the dividend.
$H or $MAR for a long term investment...?

victoriam:Where I cqn buy them?
"Trying to sift through the analyst reports for this stock and I don't seem to understand why more people aren't attracted to Hyatt, or why more people aren't talking about the company in general. They have a great members program, are loyal to their customers, but are still trying to make their business profitable for their shareholders. Some people were upset from their slight points devaluation (peak and off-peak point stays), but business is business, and the other major hotel corps do the same thing. Their new business credit card was disappointing, but obviously they don't want to give status away like the other companies. Anyway, I don't have any shares of Hyatt, but am highly considering investing, especially if they keep up their growth/acquisitions post-pandemic. Does anyone have anything to comment or add? Am I missing something here?"
