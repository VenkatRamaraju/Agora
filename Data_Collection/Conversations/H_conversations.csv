"So Hyatt Hotels will get billions in bailout money, even though the Governor of Illinois, billionaire democrat Pritzkers family, is the largest owner. Meanwhile non of Trumps venues will get a dime. The President, in order to help millions of Americans, sacrificed aid to his own holdings, for the sake of the US, in order to get the bill, stuffed with PBR funding, Kennedy Center money, pension plans for corrupt newspaper editors, and other vast amounts of pork. Imagine how many hungry Americans could have been fed with the millions going to the Kennedy Center, so it can sit empty for 6 more months."

CIBC continues to sell off using Alternative Markets System and not TSX. These are broker trades for whatever they can get. CIBC investors have given up on HEXO and Candian LPs due to regulatory issues and are moving money to US LPs. They think that Canada couldn't get it right if it tried and that USA is where the opportunity squarely lies.CIBC has by far the largest war chest of HEXO shares to get rid of. They started to sell off after HEXO insiders sold. Expect more carnage in the days to come as it contines the sell off.

"Tourism and hotel business;While most listed companies seem to do a fine job keeping both patrons and investor happy, I was surprised to see that WYND (Wyndham Destinations) recently had 6 buy and 7 hold recommendations out of a total of 13 stock analysts. And that Jim Cramer was raving too. It is in fact strange that the NYSE listed companies WH (Wyndham Hotels & Resorts) and WYND (Wyndham Destinations) still uses the name WYNDHAM. They are hotel operators. But they have dumped their properties to a number of Vacation Clubs. I made the mistake of becoming a member of Club Wyndham Access. It cost me 58379 usd . The staff used a hard sell technique during 8 hours and I finally gave up. Afterwards you are left with lies and promises – that are not kept. While the staff disappears and e-mail to their addresses bounce back…When you google on search words like “Wyndham Scams” a flood of dissatisfied people tell their sorry tales. Whistleblowers, who reveal the Wyndham unethical selling technique, have to be paid 20 million usd. The vacations offered and promised are seldom available and extremely expensive. By selling points for member’s cash W. can hide that they simply do not have enough resorts available despite membership payments and maintenance fees that in size can almost match the price of a Florida condo that you can stay in the year around. I wanted to travel to Africa and Asia. Last year I tried Sri Lanka. Wyndham Club and subsidiary RCI have only 5 places on Sri Lanka (but nothing was of course available when I was there). The Club Wyndham currency is called points. A Club Wyndham member like me get 400000 points every year (as a sort of interest on the 58379 usd down payment).Instead, if I invest and get a 5 % interest/dividend on my down payment of 58379 usd, it will give me circa 2919 usd/year.And the Condo maintenance costs for my Wyndham Club membership cost 2632 usd/year. (I have stopped paying it).These 5551 usd will give me and other Club-members a maximum of 27 days of vacation in Sri Lanka. (It cost us 15000 points/night in the few places that are available in Africa and Asia)I used hotel booking site Booking.com instead. They had more than 10000 items to choose from on Sri Lanka. They were mostly close to beach, clean, air-conditioned and with private toilet and bath etc. I paid circa 25 usd/night.This way I could stay on Sri Lanka much longer and in fact get 222 hotel-nights and save the 58379 usd for myself. But Wyndham Club never told me about it, so I wasted 58379 usd. I believe that most people scammed by Wyndham like myself don’t use their services any more. And don’t want to stay in their hotels and their 20 assorted hotel chains. This badwill will hurt WYND and WHs stock market performance. Remember, WYND has a negative booked value of – 6.04 usd/share.

There job, according to the press release, is to "" advise the board on financial and corporate strategy"". .....LMAO. This is really funny.....and really pathetic.You have to ask yourselves why the boys would do this at a time when this sham is about to end. In the past I have documented DOMBAG'S ""work history"" by pointing out how he CLAIMS to have all these degrees from top notch programs yet he has NEVER worked longer than 1 1/2 yrs. at any of these shell companies he CLAIMS employment with and does not hold a sec. license nor has he ever been registered as a RIA. Hmmmm....surely is you are employed as an inv. advisor .....woudln't u need these lic. to conduct your ""business""? .....You bet you would. And why is EVERY co. HE HIMSELF LISTS as being employed with always just a shell co. ?.....why not a merrill lynch.....or any other REPUTABLE SEC. FIRM?.......Hmmmmm....think there might be more to it?.... And how about our latest friend Mr. Bruce Horowitz?.....to whom the PR describes as a "" independent consultant for Provectus for more than a decade"".....wow...where did he come from? Who hired him? How much was he paid? What did he do for pvct? My guess? He is one of those ""paid marketeers"" we have known to be long associated with this firm My guess is that Craig hired him to attend those seminars they put together for gullible crowd.....where these predators were let loose in the crowd to work their magic and get the crowd to invest in this p0$ co. They were then paid ...on the sly,......with warrants ....which they then turned around and sold. And if you look at this guys ""work history"" that theory sounds spot on, He like DOMBAG.....has an interesting work history. Observe.....Managing director at Capital Strategists llc.......aka....a shell co. HE SET UP , ran out of his house and is MO LONGER ACTIVE.....Hmmmmm. Next we find he "" managed the equity trading department at Laidlaw Equities ""......yet a check check at broke check shows no such person has a sec. license.Hmmmmmm. Moving right along, the PR states...he was a senior vp at "" Drake Capital Securities,""......funny I can't find ANYTHING about the co. or any mention he was ever there.......Hmmmmm. These firms are listed in NY yet his last co. is listed in Cali where is claims he lived for 25 + yrs. ....Hmmm.... The only ny area Bruce horowitz I show was one who started up "" MASSIVE ABUNDANCE"".....established in 2006 in ny and developed trading systems but was indicted by Mass. regulators for taking investor money. Is it the same Bruce Horowitz?......I don't know but I bet it is. So this begs the question......why bring 2 more shady characters with questionable backgrounds with the co. a month or 2 from folding up?......My guess....they are bringing these guys in to keep them within the corp litigation ""umbrella"". By doing so they will be sued in the corp. entity and not as individuals. Pete Culpable.....by getting himself $h*tcanned......lost that critical protection and you IDIOTS can now feel free to sue the $h*t outta him in both civil and criminal court. Why do you think this dope is so desperate to get back in?.An independent forensic ACC. firm determined that he STOLE 295,000 THOUSAND DOLLARS LAST YEAR. and this bozo has the balls to turn around and try to retake the co. This is truly amazing when you look at the cast of characters associated with this firm. Craig, Petey, DOMBAG, vorlon, Brucie, Al. e. Neumann.......etc....etc.....etc......

And with and alleged 1 million left in the bank........you can rest assured the NO ONE IS OR HAS BEEN DOSED IN QUITE SOME TIME! So all that BS about 20 sites and interim by mid 2017.....is just that....BS! They are light years away from ANY INTERIM RESULTS! And they will never get there! Mark my words......when the lawsuits start to compare all their BS public statements with actual drug development progress( or lack thereof) you will see that this whole thing is a complete pile of #$%$...That's what \is going to sink them deep! Why do you think Eric and gang have ALWAYS STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO DISCLOSE HOW MANY PATIENTS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED....HOW MANY HAVE BEEN TREATED TO DATE IN THE TRIALS.....ETC..... He doesn't because the truth will really hurt and have regulators , prosecutors, legal teams, sec. officals....etc....descending on the barn like locusts!"
