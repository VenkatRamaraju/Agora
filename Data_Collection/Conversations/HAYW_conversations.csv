$30 calls for December. Pool business is BOOMING. Hayward competition is at 60+ a share. Super undervalued.
whats ur opinion on competitor such as $hayw and $lesl
"nope, she aint ready to come down yet......"
Pool guy here. got 1000 @$17. This will be a good year for Hayward with all of the pent up demand on new pools and all of the damage in the south that the cold weather caused.
"Pretty hum drum board here. I have Hayward equipment on my pool. It would be nice if somebody would answer the telephones or reply to my emails, it been dayzzzz. That's a poor way to start out with a fresh IPO."
