Should be a good ER this quarter. An increase in the divy should be sufficient to push us over $50 this year.
"CFRA moved it rating from buy to strong buy last Thursday. I think that this will prove to be a solid, long term core holding."
ER on the 29th and CC on the 30th. Should give us a lot more insight into the Bally's transaction and longer term effect on our future earnings. But an additional $22.5 million in rent should help support continuing increases in the divy.
Good conference call. Doing all the right things to strengthen the balance sheet (proactively looking at refi of the $1bn 11/20 debt maturity which will likely both reduce the interest rate and lock in a much longer term. Not reaching for deals that fall outside their investment parameters just to grow revenues. Sounds like they are working on opportunities to get involved in some of the smaller Caesars/Eldorado properties following that merger. With a 7.25% dividend yield it is a compelling equity.
"JPM raised PT to $50, DB to 54 and Jefferies to 56. This is a great long term investment with so many states looking at casino gaming to raise revenue and only two competitors with the industry experience to compete. With a 5.6% current dividend and room to continue to increase it regularly, I can see a total return of 20%/yr for the next several years."
"The news that Land & Buildings Investment is pushing GLPI to do a merger is not, IMO, good news. I'm satisfied with the way the company is being run and with the dividend I'm receiving. This is an effort to try to get a fast profit by an agitator at the expense of those of us who are longer term investors."
Maintaining the dividend at the same ratee and ratio of cash to stock. I suggest you reinvest it all for the long term.
I'm an unashamed bull on this stock. The dividend is back to the pre-pandemic level and there is no reason to believe it won't continue to grow.. This is my No. 2 holding (behind ABR) and I expect it to continue to provide both solid income from the dividends and a steady increase in the pps. In the last 18 months they've proven sufficiently dexterous to weather a black swan and come out ahead.
Looks like a nice quarter and strong guidance for the rest of the year. We've eaten the default on the Casino Queen in the last quarter and the revocation of tax benefit previously given by Maryland and things look good for the rest of the year. No debt maturities until the end of next year and lower interest rates should be a benefit then. Should give boost to the share price tomorrow.
Just saw that Macquarie initiated coverage with an outperform with a modest PT of $43. This could become a long-term core holding for me. Nice dividend and long term capital growth.
NICE 8% dividend increase- great company!
hello I'm pretty new at the stock market I've been learning little bits here and there the past 2 or 3 weeks. but I've been very curious about the dividend . does it go right into your bank account or do they mail you a check to your house how does that work. I don't have a broker I have just been using a brokerage trade account online. And haven't got much info from there. i am also thinking of purchasing stocks for this company here just would like some info on how the dividend pay works. thank you in advance to anyone who could give me a bit of info on that . have a good week
"The MGM purchase of the Cosmopolitan clearly raises the question of why GLPI walked away from the Tropicana for nothing. IMO, this could have been a major long term game changer for us and we retained nothing from the sale. Surely we could have negotiated a net profits or participation right in future developments."
In 90 days out net profit interest on any sale of the Tropicana goes from 25% to 50%. I hope they don't sell until two years have expired as we then get all the sales proceeds and I expect the property to be worth far more as we will have gotten over the worst of the pandemic. This iis a great long term old for the patient. And pays a good dividend which should now be all cash.
did anyone else get a wierd email today from GLPI?
"While I wouldn't characterize it as a blowout quarter, under the circumstances it was close. They have positioned themselves well to withstand further financial stress from the pandemic. Interest expense is down. Opex is down. Revenues are down marginally. Just a nice solid result. The statement that they reserve the right to pay the dividend entirely in cash in the future. Perhaps a preview of what we may see next week when I expect the Q3 dividend announcement. With their enhanced liquidity they may not feel the same need to save that cash as they did 90 days ago. I'm a happy shareholder."
"We weathered the spillover effect from the dramatic fall in PENN, which was way overbought. The speculation that NY, GA and others were going to open up for casinos had propelled PENN to 140, but it’s now back to 100, which is still probably too high. But GLPI will now resume its uptrend back to its pre-pandemic high over 50 later this year. Stay patient."
Finally looking like we could get back to the pre-pandemic high with a good ER next week. And the company has used this event to strengthen its position with new portfolio properties and another tenant in the mix with Bally's. Excellent long term holding for both income and capital appreciation.
solid stock with good management.
Earnings report seems to be quite strong given what happened last year. No hint on either the amount of the dividend or whether it will be all cash. They certainly have the cash on hand to do it.
Name change @ Meadows!
"Allindallas2000, any idea why GLPI's SP has not increased somewhat similarly to PENN when we are so closely tied. I do realize there was a lot of speculation with Penn concerning covid & financing, but GLPI resolved that issue. I would have thought we would see more of a bounce. Do you market is just waiting on continued quarterly beats. Additionally I realize the online betting acquisition Penn made was a factor."
"GLPI sells the Tropicana non-land assets to Bally's for $150 million. Bally's will also pay rent for the land of $10.5 million/yr. Bally's will also sell (and lease back) two properties in CO and IL to GLPI for $150 million (so no net cash exchanges hands). Bally's will pay $12 million/yr rent on the two properties being sold to GLPI. Not sure ye how this will fold into the deal GLPI made with Penn last year when it acquired the Tropicana. But otherwise, this adds $22.5 million/yr. to GLPI cash flow. Will need to see a more in-depth analysis to decide if this is big positive. I assume we'll get a lot more color on the deal in the earnings call on 4/30."
Ex dividend date todayMore money coming our way to reinvest Great stock great company
Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have both raised their price targets to $50. Total return is great. Reinvest dividends and this will be star in the portfolio.
How about that! Hit a new all time high today. Looks to be firing on all cylinders. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the dividend go up to at least $0.70 in December.
"Well the financial performance is acceptable given the challenges, The reduction in the dividend is probably warranted, as is the decision to issue script for 80% of the dividend. I'll probably opt to take the entire dividend in stock as I think this is a candidate to easily double by the end of next year. Looks like the split dividend will only be in place this year as cash rent kicks in in Q4."
let's c they pay the rent than the landlord pays us and some of us go to the casino's and lose the money back than it starts all over.
"Well the market is clearly underwhelmed by the results. Looking more and more like a boring REIT. Perhaps we are to the point where this is primarily a dividend driven holding, with only modest growth opportunities. Not bad, just boring."
"Truist moved its PT to $57. I think this is still suffering from last year's agreement with Penn to defer rents, which resulted in us receiving dividends in kind. With new leases signed this year I expect strong earnings and significant increases in dividend thru 2022 pushing us steadily higher. Still my no. 2 holding."
They may not be able to pay a dividend. Went to the Meadows and won all their money. Three hours on Roulette and came away $40.00 richer. Woo Hoo!!!
No pr on the sale of the belle to casino queen by czr They still get the same rent from czr but get a revenue stream from casino queenSeems positive to me
ANOTHER GREAT QUARTER- what a company led by some great talent.
Don’t get the drop- ever since the div raise and great quarter?
"With the recent increases in analysts price targets into the 50s, the pps is finally trending up."
"Newly issued notes have allowed the company to retire most of higher yielding debt due next year and lock in lower interest rates for 5-11 years. Good move. Saving 1% on a billion dollars of debt reduces cost by $10 million/year, all dropping to the bottom line before tax or $78 million after tax over 10 years."
"Carlino reported they have entered into 18 NDAs for the Trop. He characterized most as unserious, but was surprised at the level of interest. It is clearly unlikely an agreement to sell will be signed in the next four months, which for us is good. If no agreement is signed before April, out net proceeds interest goes up to 50% from the current 25%. Since it was speculated last year that the property might be worth $700 million, this will be an enormous asset once Covid is under control."
The PENN earnings release does not give much insight into what effect they may have on GLPI. Nothing there to suggest that we should be concerned in light of the Tropicana deal. I did note that they said nothing about closing that deal. Long term this is still a strong buy.
Just got the notice to make an election for the dividend to be paid on 12/16. I'll elect the all stock option. I assume the next dividend in 3/21 will be all cash and should get 3-4 cents per quarter bump.
"""Record first quarter financial results"" per CEO Carlino."
