"You have to believe the CV is going to really hit the casinos and the effect will spill over to GLPI. While it is starting to look cheap, that may be an illusion."
Earnings release moved up to Tuesday pm. Must want to get it out there in advance of something important coming. I view this as a positive.
Stochastics on the weekly have already crossed seasonaly this is downward pressure for this stock and the MACD is about to crossover and go red will wait for the correction.
YEAH- Credit Suisse begins coverage with OUTPERFORM!!!!
They may not be able to pay a dividend. Went to the Meadows and won all their money. Three hours on Roulette and came away $40.00 richer. Woo Hoo!!!
Great dividend today.
Amazing this stock has gone up 8 days in a row without so much as a 20 cent correction interday.
Any update on the Div?
"Blowout report this afternoon from Caesers on the business at its regional casinos. Should bode well for Penn, Boyd and Eldorado."
"It was bad enough that they are paying most of the dividend in stock, but now they just issued $200,000,000 in new senior notes. This will cause a dilution of the share price."
GREAT JOB MM - you moved it to touch the 50DMA - now you begin the afternoon tank - jerk.
GLPI is down 14.61% to 22.85
Who screws with the stock price around div ex day? MMs are manipulating this. The SEC has improved their surveillance and monitoring of these criminal manipulations. All just send a complaint if you care about what goes on with the criminal manipulation of all stocks. Take back the market!
And just like that - FIZZLE OUT!
"Penn blew away expectations, further bolstering the long term prospects for GLPI. While Covid remains a threat, it seems clear that the industry--especially outside the Strip--has found a way to operate profitably, assuring their ability to pay rent."
WHAT A COMPANY/STOCK!
"Carlino reported they have entered into 18 NDAs for the Trop. He characterized most as unserious, but was surprised at the level of interest. It is clearly unlikely an agreement to sell will be signed in the next four months, which for us is good. If no agreement is signed before April, out net proceeds interest goes up to 50% from the current 25%. Since it was speculated last year that the property might be worth $700 million, this will be an enormous asset once Covid is under control."
A Fairly Nice read:https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/where-will-gaming-and-leisure-properties-be-in-3-years/
Can this stock EVER hold a gain???
Hey BOZO execs - any support yet?
Ah - very nice ex dividend come back. Gave us the dividend money and now the stock moves right back up. Definitely pays to be long.
Should be a good ER this quarter. An increase in the divy should be sufficient to push us over $50 this year.
Does the same all the time - up early then sell off!
GLPI is down 5.00% to 44.45
did anyone else get a wierd email today from GLPI?
"I have several REITs - all cheaper and have higher dividend yields. But GLPI appears to be the most solid and the dividend ain't bad. This stock also appears to be a trading stock as well as a dividend stock, accounting for the swings. However, over all, it's rising so I have given up trying to time the market and holding on to this one."
HEY BOZO EXECS - is it time to support this #$%$ stock yet??
This one’s a gamble. 
Dare I repeat myself- what a company/management/stock!
GLPI looking great today should go up from here into the dividend run at the end of the month or early march
Buying more tomorrow am with my big phat divided money!! Thanks GLPI !!
GLPI reached a 52 Week low at 28.68

GLPI selling overdone in here 7% yield now on a strong divi stock no news out there
GLPI reached a 52 Week low at $31.20
GREAT - back to about a 7% yield on this stock. When will management support the stock price?
Gaming and Leisure Props is up 4.94% to 37.38
GLPI reached a 52 Week low at 32.48
Taking a breather before earnings- I’m thinking it’s gonna be good- considering the run and upgrades!
Another day markets up ANOTHER DAY IN THE RED- #$%$ stock.
GLPI is going straight up on light buying very strange.
"Newly issued notes have allowed the company to retire most of higher yielding debt due next year and lock in lower interest rates for 5-11 years. Good move. Saving 1% on a billion dollars of debt reduces cost by $10 million/year, all dropping to the bottom line before tax or $78 million after tax over 10 years."
"Oppenheimer Reiterates Outperform on Box (BOX) Following 2QBox, Inc. (BOX) PT Raised to $24 at Mitsubishi UFJ"
I bought this stock because of the great dividend. Wonder what will happen now
If GLPI can get to $39 I'll be one happy investor
I'm an unashamed bull on this stock. The dividend is back to the pre-pandemic level and there is no reason to believe it won't continue to grow.. This is my No. 2 holding (behind ABR) and I expect it to continue to provide both solid income from the dividends and a steady increase in the pps. In the last 18 months they've proven sufficiently dexterous to weather a black swan and come out ahead.
Looks like a nice quarter and strong guidance for the rest of the year. We've eaten the default on the Casino Queen in the last quarter and the revocation of tax benefit previously given by Maryland and things look good for the rest of the year. No debt maturities until the end of next year and lower interest rates should be a benefit then. Should give boost to the share price tomorrow.
"GLPI sells the Tropicana non-land assets to Bally's for $150 million. Bally's will also pay rent for the land of $10.5 million/yr. Bally's will also sell (and lease back) two properties in CO and IL to GLPI for $150 million (so no net cash exchanges hands). Bally's will pay $12 million/yr rent on the two properties being sold to GLPI. Not sure ye how this will fold into the deal GLPI made with Penn last year when it acquired the Tropicana. But otherwise, this adds $22.5 million/yr. to GLPI cash flow. Will need to see a more in-depth analysis to decide if this is big positive. I assume we'll get a lot more color on the deal in the earnings call on 4/30."
GLPI is down 15.64% to 28.00
ER next week should be a catalyst to push us to a new all time by year end. But I still haven’t gotten over their failure to capitalize on their ownership of the Tropicana. That was a missed opportunity of a lifetime.
Don't know why it's down today. The Meadows took $400 from my friend and me. Rats
Thanks for another big dividend check Glpi
"$GLPI Had the confidence in $PENN to work out a “get out of jail free coupon” ... and help ease the books for Penn. Penn will recover quick and aggressively, and both $GLPI and $PENN will make out like bandits in the near future."
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at $37.34
Good conference call. Doing all the right things to strengthen the balance sheet (proactively looking at refi of the $1bn 11/20 debt maturity which will likely both reduce the interest rate and lock in a much longer term. Not reaching for deals that fall outside their investment parameters just to grow revenues. Sounds like they are working on opportunities to get involved in some of the smaller Caesars/Eldorado properties following that merger. With a 7.25% dividend yield it is a compelling equity.
GLPI reached a 52 Week low at 36.04
Casinos start shutting down this stock could be in trouble.
Gaming and Leisure Props is up 4.91% to 45.07
Pretty sure if el dorado buys Caesar we some properties Looks good for higher dividends!!!!!!Buying more here
More cash for us !!! Another divided raise
LOOKING GREAT- let’s see if we get some good news.
1.75% dividend now
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 50.33
CONFIRMED Breakout above 38.73 - target 40.51 --
Just saw that Macquarie initiated coverage with an outperform with a modest PT of $43. This could become a long-term core holding for me. Nice dividend and long term capital growth.
GLPI is down 4.94% to 44.05
"One of the better dividend stocks. It seems reasonable as the economy improves and summer comes on, gaming increases which ""should"" translate to steady profits for GLPI."
GLPI is down -5.10% to 33.31
"Thee Caesar's El Dorado merger has been approved by NJ and will close next week. Good interview with the chmn on CNBC. The activities that have been closed (buffets, full service restaurants, low stakes tables) are low profit margin and operations are overall more profitable without them. GLPI will benefit long term from this merger."
What is the zidovudine date
"So we have one more dividend which will be mostly in kind. With the resumption of cash dividends in Q1, I think we will be back over $50."
"If el dorado buys caesars do you think Glpi gets some of the real estate ?? I do More properties, higher dividends Let’s go higher"
Earnings report seems to be quite strong given what happened last year. No hint on either the amount of the dividend or whether it will be all cash. They certainly have the cash on hand to do it.
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 50.94
"Motley Fool says merger is best possibility to compete. What is interesting: Since it is GLPI that owns the casinos so if a merger happens it bodes well for everybody. However, if Ceasar's or some other large company buys out Penn etc, they would still have to lease or buy HCAP. Tricky business. Ideas? (Please be rational). A deal we could see a mile awayIn reality, Penn National and Pinnacle Entertainment have been dancing toward each other for a few years now. Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc (NASDAQ: GLPI), the real estate investment trust created by Penn National, owns most of the real estate where Pinnacle Entertainment operates casinos. The two are effectively partners, and the deal will just bring their gambling operations together. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-casino-merger-horizon-120300191.html"
Hey BOZO execs - how about a little support for you stock. Another day another down.
"Nice to see another transaction which is accretive to earnings. I assume the board will declare the same dividend next week as the last one, with a large stock component, before going to all cash in Q1 2021. The only concern I have is that their debt is all entirely short to intermediate term.. It seems to me they should be locking in at least 2 billion in 30 year bonds and another 2 billion in 20 years."
GLPI is up 12.26% to 22.16
WHAT A COMPAN/STOCK- if only all my REITS performed like this.
GLPI reached an all time low at 23.92
Weekly stochastics looks ugly this stock has seasonaly sold off in the summer through the fall. Macd has shown it's first red bar we will see what happens this time.
Gaming and Leisure Props is up 5.85% to 42.00
"The MGM purchase of the Cosmopolitan clearly raises the question of why GLPI walked away from the Tropicana for nothing. IMO, this could have been a major long term game changer for us and we retained nothing from the sale. Surely we could have negotiated a net profits or participation right in future developments."
"Allindallas2000, any idea why GLPI's SP has not increased somewhat similarly to PENN when we are so closely tied. I do realize there was a lot of speculation with Penn concerning covid & financing, but GLPI resolved that issue. I would have thought we would see more of a bounce. Do you market is just waiting on continued quarterly beats. Additionally I realize the online betting acquisition Penn made was a factor."
I guess we will have to wait until next week for the dividend announcement.
let's c they pay the rent than the landlord pays us and some of us go to the casino's and lose the money back than it starts all over.
GLPI this year
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 49.22
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 40.48
Ok guys- does anyone know what’s causing the constant move higher besides target increases- I would think something big is coming- like a merger or buyout?
GLPI is down 12.48% to 13.25
Blowout quarter. Carlino and his team are knocking it our of the park. Should be back to $50 in Q1 2021.
thanks for the dividend
"Can you guys picture just how much people are going to want a gaming/leisure diversion when this virus lets up? First thing my wife said this morning when we woke up. I'm ready to go back to Vegas. ;-) So guess where my poor little $2,400 rebate is going to wind up... ;-) Good luck longs!"
GLPI reached an all time low at 18.81
"CFRA moved it rating from buy to strong buy last Thursday. I think that this will prove to be a solid, long term core holding."
What about the cash dividend?
Did anyone else get a notice from GLPI today?
So rigged!
Why big drop after hours?
"ERI has gone from 71 to 15 in three weeks. Penn is down 50%, I'm sure GLPI's operated properties revenues are in the dumper. We're down a third in three weeks with few signs of a turnaround."
"Earn $0.43, dividend pays $0.63, how?"
Goes X tomorrow people should be buying buying away what is going on
BEAUTIFUL- took it down to retest the 50 week- it held and has reversed- VERY GOOD- we will be moving up to new highs.
"Since our fortunes are heavily linked to PENN's success, it is good to see that there was significant insider buying of their newly issued shares."
"We may have seen the low for this cycle. An analyst today said the gaming REITs like GLPI could go 44-48 months without any rental income and still be OK. It would take cajones grande, but buying here could be a triple. But ABR may be an easier lift."
GOD I LOVE THIS COMPANY/STOCK/MANAGEMENT!!!
"An interesting article on GLPI, https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235060-gaming-leisure-properties-brief-synopsis?isDirectRoadblock=true"
starting to creep towards buy range again
#$%$ --> a block trade moves it down this much???? I thought they were supposed to handle it such that the price isn't drastically affected.
"BREAKOUTWATCH for possible breakout above 38.29, no resistance in area just above.Type: True breakout from double resistance.Target: 39.56, 3.8% Stop: 37.67 Loss: 1.2% P/L ratio: 3.2 : 1 - Excellent"
Wow! Finally broke through $40
WHAT A STOCK- AMAZING!
The PENN earnings release does not give much insight into what effect they may have on GLPI. Nothing there to suggest that we should be concerned in light of the Tropicana deal. I did note that they said nothing about closing that deal. Long term this is still a strong buy.
WHAT A MOVE- GREAT COMPANY!
How about that! Hit a new all time high today. Looks to be firing on all cylinders. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the dividend go up to at least $0.70 in December.
"While I wouldn't characterize it as a blowout quarter, under the circumstances it was close. They have positioned themselves well to withstand further financial stress from the pandemic. Interest expense is down. Opex is down. Revenues are down marginally. Just a nice solid result. The statement that they reserve the right to pay the dividend entirely in cash in the future. Perhaps a preview of what we may see next week when I expect the Q3 dividend announcement. With their enhanced liquidity they may not feel the same need to save that cash as they did 90 days ago. I'm a happy shareholder."
GLPI Stock Analysis!https://www.reddit.com/r/gamblingstocks/comments/ni5r7n/glpi_stock_analysis/
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 44.80
SEEMS like EVERY DAY the high dividend stocks DROP - you would think the opposite would be happening with FED move coming.
"norty55,"
"JPM raised PT to $50, DB to 54 and Jefferies to 56. This is a great long term investment with so many states looking at casino gaming to raise revenue and only two competitors with the industry experience to compete. With a 5.6% current dividend and room to continue to increase it regularly, I can see a total return of 20%/yr for the next several years."
"So I compared 1H 2021 to 1H2019 to get a pre-COVID comparison at it generally looks good. Total revenue is $619 million vs 577 (a 7% increase). Net income was $265 mm vs 186mm (a 42% increase). EPS was $1.14 v $0.86 (a 32% increase). I expect full year 2021 will be even stronger unless the anti-vaxers cause another decline in revenue from decreased foot traffic. That would be a shame, but you can't cure stupid."
"Can GLPI continue to outpace its dividend? While there have been small increases in the dividend, they have been far outpace by the rise in the pps, with a concomitant decrease in the return to below 6%. As a REIT, that isn't bad, but for the pps to continue to go up, I think we need to see visibility to more substantial increases in the dividend. Will be interesting to see what comes out of the earnings release and call tomorrow."
GLPI is up 12.81% to 25.71
"We weathered the spillover effect from the dramatic fall in PENN, which was way overbought. The speculation that NY, GA and others were going to open up for casinos had propelled PENN to 140, but it’s now back to 100, which is still probably too high. But GLPI will now resume its uptrend back to its pre-pandemic high over 50 later this year. Stay patient."
Nice article here on GLPI. https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/news/2019/02/04/4466000-shares-in-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-acquired-by-pggm-investments.html
"At a good support area, earnings in-line, revenues beat, good yield...might have to nibble a little for a long term investment."
"Well the financial performance is acceptable given the challenges, The reduction in the dividend is probably warranted, as is the decision to issue script for 80% of the dividend. I'll probably opt to take the entire dividend in stock as I think this is a candidate to easily double by the end of next year. Looks like the split dividend will only be in place this year as cash rent kicks in in Q4."
That was the best dividend payment I ever got did all drip
Just got the notice to make an election for the dividend to be paid on 12/16. I'll elect the all stock option. I assume the next dividend in 3/21 will be all cash and should get 3-4 cents per quarter bump.
JUST BROKE INTO NEW 52 WEEK HIGH - lets see if we hold today.
GLPI is down 4.92% to 40.55
"So we get our divy Tuesday and I'll reinvest all. The company is not being fully appreciated. Given the solid performance and current dividend and likely increasing future dividend, we should be trading near $50. This will eventually get recognized for its growth potential and we'll see a quick runup to a fair value."
Thanks for the great dividend
GLPI is down 4.98% to 42.39
YEAH - this garbage stock is back over 7% yield - I see Wall Street has a lot of faith in the MORON EXECS.
This was a great quarter considering- I’m long and strong! Great management!
"Really difficult to analyze results since the reported comparison with 2020 is pretty meaningless. would need to go compare this Q2 with 2019. Something I just focused on are the CPI escalators, which are generally capped at 2%. If the CPI continues to jump like it did this quarter, that could really limit the company's ability to even match the increase in inflation. While that won't affect their ability to pay the current dividend, it could limit future increases."
Don’t get the drop- ever since the div raise and great quarter?
Hoping for a positive cc following a neutral earnings report.
Wish I could have bought more this morning- it was a great long term transaction!
"NICE - FINALLY EXECS MAKING MOVE:14:32 Gaming and Leisure Properties CFO acquires 85,000 common shares In a regulatory filing, Gaming and Leisure Properties SVP, CFO, and Treasurer William J. Clifford disclosed the purchase of 85,000 common shares of the company in two tranches each priced at $33 per shareRead more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2683293"
"Would be nice to know if they still stand behind their guidance. Gaming, food and beverage make up about 12% of revenue and will be directly affected by a drop in customers. I assume we'll get some kind of interim announcement."
"GLPI versus MGP Net margins return on equity and return on assets all much better by GLPI, P.E. MGP over 40 GLPI under 22Dividend Yield over 6.5% for GLPI only 5% for MGP. Last 4 quarters earnings for GLPI met or beat estimates but for MGP all missed thier estimates. Investors Business Daily rates GLPI as the second best Reit in the universe while MGP rates 10th.Hands down winner off theese stats is GLPI"
Amazing how the little guy always loses- the stock dividend was calculated at $43.3758- a local high. They always manipulate to give as few shares as possible!
Hopefully we got rid of the weak hands. Good volume looks like we may have set the bottom. Dividend stocks have been getting beaten down lately - but I think we will continue the move back to my target in the low-mid 40's.
"Looking at 6 month chart - looks like GLPI ""might"" been in for a correction. If that happens with volume, it could drop to a good buy point 35.5 give or take."
"""Record first quarter financial results"" per CEO Carlino."
WTH is wrong with this stock?
Hey EXECS - just sit back and enjoy another stogey while you watch the stock drop. BTW you guys do the worst conference call of any of the stocks I hold. You sound like a bunch of idiots. Why don't you free up some money on some classes on how to run a conference call.
Anyone know why this stock in tanking today?
PENN is not a financially stable company. The amount of debt they have alone is concerning
The run to 39-40 begins- after the consolidation!
This stock never makes new highs- I guess you collect dividend and sell around 36-37. Waiting for management that can actually perform a good earnings call.
10 days in a row down- HEY #$%$ MANAGEMENT CARE TO DO SOMETHING?
I am still expecting this to move in the 40's -> dividend yield should move below 6% like others in this category.
Woof! I guess those wanting in before Ex-Div. date got in and others took profits. I'm in for more - Dividends coming this month should be sweet. and re-investing them bring ave cost down.
Anyone know why this stock went up 2.9% today on twice the normal volume?
GOD I wish I could buy more- GREAT COMPANY/LEADERSHIP!
"Look at the cash flows and the executive salaries. Come on, what's up here? I would rather be an executive at this company than an investor who is paying their salaries.."
GLPI hasn't declared given an announce date yet. Last year was 4/29. What's the problem?
I sold my position in this because I feel there are better REITs paying 7% that have better valuation. My concerns on this was the massive debt and the AFFO is a fluff number. Look at the cash flow from operations. The payout ratio looks fantastic when you are looking at AFFO which adds back a bunch of fluff. But when you compare it to cashflow from operations the payout ratio is closer to 85%.
Finally looking like we could get back to the pre-pandemic high with a good ER next week. And the company has used this event to strengthen its position with new portfolio properties and another tenant in the mix with Bally's. Excellent long term holding for both income and capital appreciation.
NOW WHATS WRONG??????
Just reinvested all my big fat dividends Thank you Glpi for more shares
Would this be a good stock to get into for long term
GLPI is up 12.95% to 19.80
"On first review, results are in line. Guidance is not as optimistic as I had hoped, but I don't see any reason to be concerned though I don't expect to see the TSO of 2019 to be repeated."
hello I'm pretty new at the stock market I've been learning little bits here and there the past 2 or 3 weeks. but I've been very curious about the dividend . does it go right into your bank account or do they mail you a check to your house how does that work. I don't have a broker I have just been using a brokerage trade account online. And haven't got much info from there. i am also thinking of purchasing stocks for this company here just would like some info on how the dividend pay works. thank you in advance to anyone who could give me a bit of info on that . have a good week
So with the dividend announcement did we win or lose. Also I don't understand why they had to offer the dividend(s) this way?
GLPI RSI is over 82 on the daily chart and over 78 on the weekly chart very extended here
Only one of my stocks up today???
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 45.74
"The news that Land & Buildings Investment is pushing GLPI to do a merger is not, IMO, good news. I'm satisfied with the way the company is being run and with the dividend I'm receiving. This is an effort to try to get a fast profit by an agitator at the expense of those of us who are longer term investors."
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 43.72
This thing is performing like a dog ever since earnings which were great- any reasons why it’s out of favor now?
Interesting that Penn' success is not flowing thru to GLPI. This remains very undervalued. I two years it will be a multiple of where it is now as rents from the Trop and their other deals come on line.
Is this the day that we will FINALLY not be manipulated down? Every day they move it up in the morning then sell it off all day - #$%$ MM.Hey EXECS - care to FINALLY support your stock?
They are selling $500 million of notes that mature in 11 years at 4% interest. Nice move to lock in intermediate term debt at low interest rate.
OH yeah baby - we get an upgrade from hold to buy from Suntrust and it powers us up 0.7% ( just about what general market is doing )
GLPI is down 7.46% to 36.61
GLPI is up 4.95% to 41.13
This #$%$ MANAGEMENT has done it Again- BUSH LEAGUE LOSERS.
"WHAT HAPPENED, ?? GLPI WAS DOWN $.61 CENTS AT THE CLOSE TODAY ..... ANY INPUT AS TO WHY ??REMEMBER NEXT WEEK THANKSGIVING AND SHORT STOCK TRADING WEEK.. ALSO EX DIVIDEND DATE NOV 30 !JUST CHECKED ATER HOURS TRADING GLPI BACK UP TO $35.87 UP $.16 CENTS .... WILL WE GO BACK OVER $36.00 OLLARS OR MONDAY MORNING TRADING !! ??ANY COMENTS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED !!"
GLPI is down 11.11% to 16.92
"So we now own the Tropicana and in lieu of cash we give Penn 6+ months of free rent on all their other leases. Plus Penn gets an equity kicker if GLPI sell the Trop within 2 years for a profit. GLPI's lenders approved the deal. Look forward to hearing more color on the deal next week in the CC, especially regarding the effect on FCF. But it looks like a good deal all around."
Does anyone know if any of the Barstools revenue will flow thru to GLPI once it comes on line?
"With the recent increases in analysts price targets into the 50s, the pps is finally trending up."
GPLI is on its way up. As long as interest rates don’t rocket up. $36 to $38 a share within 3 months.Plus you get a 7.5% yield to lean on.
Better than going to Vegas
Going up as the ex-dvidend date approaches. A steady 6+% is a pretty good quarterly rate in today's market. I'll buy more a day or two after. ;-])
Thank goodness I own real stocks besides this LOSER!
GLPI is down 10.90% to 17.42
GLPI is down 6.08% to 41.12
Happy with the earnings- I think we see 39-40 after this consolidation.
Good to see it held $36 on a VERY bad day in the market - lets see if it can continue doing it.
GLPI is up 11.99% to 24.85
No pr on the sale of the belle to casino queen by czr They still get the same rent from czr but get a revenue stream from casino queenSeems positive to me
What is the codices date?
ER on the 29th and CC on the 30th. Should give us a lot more insight into the Bally's transaction and longer term effect on our future earnings. But an additional $22.5 million in rent should help support continuing increases in the divy.
#$%$ STOCK is over 7% now -- HEY EXECS how about you put some of your money into this PIECE OF #$%$?
Nice to see a director make an open market purchase.
"Will GLPI maintain its dividend? The deal with PENN reduces our rental income by A bit over 300 million spread over 3 quarters. The impact on Q2 and Q3 will be about $112 million each and another $84 million in Q4. The current dividend is about $150 million/ quarter. With the drawdown of their line of credit of $500 million and other cash, it looks like they have adequate liquidity to maintain the $0.70 dividend, assuming other tenants continue to pay and other revenues are not too impacted. But they may decide to reduce it temporarily to conserve liquidity."
Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have both raised their price targets to $50. Total return is great. Reinvest dividends and this will be star in the portfolio.
Ex dividend date todayMore money coming our way to reinvest Great stock great company
SOMETHING HAS TO BE HAPPENING - ARE WE GOING TO CATCH A BID?
GLPI reached a 52 Week high at 41.62
I'm HOLDING even after this big run - I think something big is going to happen.
Maintaining the dividend at the same ratee and ratio of cash to stock. I suggest you reinvest it all for the long term.
HALLALUYA - MISTER MM decided it's ok to move higher FOR ONCE.
"Schwab just raised its rating to an A, continuing the string of upgrades. Looking forward to earnings on Thursday."
I see they are calling the 4.875% notes due in Nov. and the 4.375% notes due April 2021. They must be getting ready to do a transaction and needed to get these off he books. Will be interesting to see. I would expect to hear either in the earnings call or before.
Nice- $50.50!
Gaming and Leisure Props is down 5.02% to 35.37
Moody's reaffirmed its Ba1 rating for GLPI's senior unsecured debt. Positive news in this environment.
"Looking forward to another solid earnings report the end of the month. Still cheap with a 10%+ dividend. In a zero interest rate environment, this is a real nice core holding for the present and for the long run."
Heading down to the Meadows Casino Friday. Need to win some money back.
Good earnings conference call- more professional.
"What a dead board this is. Comes down to all the casino real estate, if they stay open probably a winner though I would be very worried about El Dorado Caesar’s merger. They are buried in debt. El Dorado would love to bail on the merger but must pay 700 million penalty from what I heard. David buying Goliath, not sure they can handle it."
HUGE VOLUME MOVE - this BREAKOUT IS REAL!
Goes X tomorrow big dividend
1y Target Est 38.83 - ;-])
In 90 days out net profit interest on any sale of the Tropicana goes from 25% to 50%. I hope they don't sell until two years have expired as we then get all the sales proceeds and I expect the property to be worth far more as we will have gotten over the worst of the pandemic. This iis a great long term old for the patient. And pays a good dividend which should now be all cash.
GLPI Please be aware I'm visiting The Meadows and winning a lot of money from you. At least I hope so.
"ER next Thursday after the market closes, with call on Friday morning. This one has more significance than most as they should address transition back to full cash dividend, any progress on a deal for the Tropicana (I still hope they don't do anything until we get thru the pandemic to maximize return to GLPI)."
HEY MM how about you go SCREW around with some other stock - I'm sick of you manipulating this stock down all the time.
Should be getting ER in 3 weeks along with a dividend announcement. Hopefully all cash and a small but meaningful increase.
"TA looks great with potential to begin ripping higher. Buy rating at 9trading: 7, Target: 46.99."
Some friends and I went to the Meadows Casino last Friday and played the electronic Roulette machine. Within 1 hour it was down for 30 minutes with 4 employees trying to fix it. Very frustrating!! Why can't they put another machine in (only have one) or fix this machine (second time it has gone down when I'm playing. When everyone complained were told if we didn't like it go play regular Roulette. Great customer service. This happened once @ The Rivers Casino and they at least gave every player a drink to keep them at the machine while it was repaired.
NICE 8% dividend increase- great company!
I should have stayed away from the Meadows Casino yesterday and invested the $300.00 into the stock. At least I get a dividend back when I do that.
The pps continues to melt up as w get closer to to the full cash dividend.
38.89 is the 52 week high - lets see if we can take this out today or tomorrow. Remember I still think this should be in the low 40s for fair valuation compared to others in the space
GLPI is up 6.02% to 35.06
GLPI reached a 52 Week low at $32.18
GLPI reached an all time low at 17.19
GLPI reached an all time low at 13.47
Name change @ Meadows!
The letter to stakeholders from PENN's CEO (on their website) gives excellent insight into the Tropicana deal. While it will impact GLPI's cash flow this year (and may require a temporary cut in or suspension of the dividend) long term this is going to be a real plus leading to a significant return in 2021 and beyond. I'm happy to accept some temporary pain for the long term gain.
4/25 - up on nice volume.
dividend payout ratio is 160.10% – so we could see some upside on GLPI but perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally. have you guys heard of awesomesto-cks. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
Sorry for being the naysayer but this company profits will be suffering for the rest of the year and dividends will surely be cut. Wait for the stock drop when the dividend cut is announced and maybe buy 3 days later after the dust has settled.
Wow- now 51 and the ask is much higher- WHAT A COMPANY AND MANAGEMENT!!!!
"Need to study in more detail, but looks like another nice quarter."
Breaking out on a weekly basis - target around 39-40.
