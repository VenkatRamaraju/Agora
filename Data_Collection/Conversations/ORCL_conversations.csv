"Larry EllisonThe answer is I think there's no question. You're going to see a lot of database growth – a lot of database acceleration starting next year which we're a quarter away from.

"SHEP. HERE.......................... If anyone listened to CNBC yesterday after the close Dan Niles was on. I really like the guy. His top 5 stocks for this year were amd, lite, dis, nvda, fb. For next next year he is picking jpm, orcl, energy spider Gan ltd, and Magna, international. His rationale on orcl is that it is sort of like MSFT was trading when it got into the cloud and the stock took off. I have not bought orcl yet, but I am thinking after the Georgia election on the 5th, I may be a buyer of 100 shares of ORCL. I have a neighbor who works from home for ORCL and the next time I see his family walking by, I am going to ask him about the prospects for Orcl's stock. Good luck, everyone. I really like Dan Niles and consider him to be a genius when it comes to tech stocks and even the CNBC host was surprised that he only had 2 tech stocks. (GAN is a software stocks for online gambling---that one might do well, but it doesn't interest me) but I do like the Orcl pick and ORCL pays a div."
"Any thoughts on whether Oracle should buy Cloudera? At the $5.3 bil price tag, it would be an easy fold in, but I'm not tech savvy enough to know whether it could be a fit. I just know that finding a bunch of coders, engineers, and programmers is not easy, and Cloudera has a stable and growing customer list that might be of more benefit to Oracle with its stronger business and management approach. There is a 30 day ""Go Shop"" provision that would allow Oracle to grab this. Thoughts? Thx in advance & glta."

"Oracle will be better than MSFT for two reasons. Give it more time to work. And do a more serious job in cleaning out the I'm bedded Chicom spy code. Make no mistake, it is scattered all over everything. They have to vet every line of code and then decide how to proceed. If Ellison sees it as a challenge, his out of of the box thinking can turn the massive chore into an opportunity. For Oracle it opens new markets, not just the old. Becomes a double win from true synergy.Good luck and go Oracle. "
"Oracle has a new shot on the JEDI Defense contract: Microsoft and Amazon won't be awarded work on the new deal automatically will have to submit proposals - and the government is also reaching out to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to outline the plan: ""The door remains wide open for the next three and a half months,"" says Pentagon Acting Chief Information Officer John Sherman.“This is really about mission need,” Sherman tells Bloomberg. “Because JEDI was conceived over three and a half years ago, we have moved to a different place” in terms of cloud advances."

Tired of it. Tell my sister what's going on down there $ORCL $VENA $AMZN
ORCL is poised for large gains. NetSuite alone has to be valued at $100B. The partnership with TikTok will see another $25B added to it. It's cloud business will jump on the next earning report. Should see $100 for 2021.
"Quit playing games with my heart, with my heart $ORCL $VENA"
"If you are 100X better, then why did we miss revenues? :/"
The time to be bearish on ORCL has passed. Anyone who understands ORCL's untapped potential in cloud computing sees the writing on the wall. Ever since Barron's first made this clear the stock has soared. ORCL is a fantastic company and unlike many other great companies it trades at a very reasonable valuation. Rising rates and inflation won't give the shorts any meaningful returns in a stock like this. In fact ORCL is a very stable stock to begin with. I fully believe ORCL will make the leap into the cloud. It is in its best interest to do so. You should be buying as much as you can right now. ORCL is at a big discount compared to where it will be several years from now.
"SuperGmoney, I sure hope so. I have $50 December 15 calls, which of course are the options expiring day after earnings. I have been cost averaging down heavily where my cost is .87 so I'm getting smoked for the moment. I would welcome this to get to right at $50 day of earnings because I know the implied volatility would take the options to about $1.25 due to earnings movement. With that said, I don't know how Oracle behaves when CRM reports."
"I'm an Oracle Developer, I love this company!!! 90$+ next week"
What the hell is going on with Oracle!
"This is going to be company after company with bad earnings. The overall market is running, if this is a surprise, just short companies before earnings because almost all will be bad for Q2, but the mkt doesn't seem to care until companies actually release q2 results."
"ORCL consensus estimates up today 4.46 to 4.656 analysts are increasing their price targets but none of them are giving a rating change, hmmmmat 4.65 (and increasing) a 25x PE seems very conservative with their balance sheet and cloud opportunities.I really dont see how this isnt a 100 stock when compared to any other software company.I guess we will have to settle for a fat growing dividend."
ORCL loses plus $4B lawsuits to HPE!
Should be $60+ after earnings
I'm buying puts to be conservative...
"Even if the sale doesn’t go through, this is still a good company to invest in. They have a low P/E ratio, pay dividends and now have a lot of global media attention attracting lots of investors and other business deals."

"Trump said his staff are “very close to a deal” and signaled what could be telling support for Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman.“I have a high respect for Larry Ellison,” he said. “He’s somebody I know, he’s been really a terrific guy for a long time.”The proposal, unveiled in part, doesn’t call for Oracle to buy the business outright. Instead, the company would invest in a newly restructured global TikTok, with operations based in the U.S., according to people familiar with the proposal. Bytedance would maintain majority ownership and at least three shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company -- General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management -- would take stakes in the new business, said the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t finalized.Oracle’s proposal lacks the payment to the U.S. government that the president has insisted be the condition of any deal, according to two people familiar with the plan. Yet the company will try to use the promise of creating 20,000 new jobs through the popular video app as a way to win his approval, they said.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has played a central role in brokering a deal that would shift the Chinese-owned video app’s U.S. operations over to an American company, leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, and has promised to give Trump the panel’s recommendation this week.White House adviser Jared Kushner voiced strong support for Oracle’s bid"

NEVER BUY PEAK
For the new investors here. Please don't be discouraged when oracle dips a few dollars after a good earnings. This has happened every time since the past 2 years. It may dip at first but looking at recent patterns it has always bounced back up
"larry ellison had an opportunity to explode this stock into the stratosphere by stepping up and hosting Parler and sticking it to it's biggest rivals amazon, fartbook, twitter, and apple with one stroke.......no guts, no glory......stock back to the mid 50s"
I’ve been a share holder for 64 quarters. Share price drops after earnings is expected because the price runs up before earnings. Oracle is a value command not a growth company. The stock price history reflects this. Buy and forget about it. You will make money as I have over the last 16 years. Less risk investing.
Going strong!
"Would wait for (inevitable) market drop, data base projections purported to be YUGE for ORCL and others in 2022; get back in / add @ 82 or closer to 77 in markets experience a more significant routing . . ."
This company and IBM are the most undervalued cloud stocks in the market!
"I have own Oracle for almost 20 years . If ever there was a company prepared for the cloud its Oracle , its all systems go now ."
Oracle dropped $9 bucks after earnings from $85 down to $76. Add $9 to $85 and your target is $94.
"Oracle's strategy of slow and steady to ultimately win the race has always proven successful. The company has top rated apps, top rated technology, produces its own hardware and cloud infrastructure which is a perfect recipe to take orders and scale up very quickly. For shareholders, they've been paying dividends, buying back stock and always looking out for the bottom line while making significant investments in targeted growth areas. Their competitors other than SFDC have not made any significant investments other than improving their existing offerings which Oracle has caught up to or surpassed.The time is now."

Thoughts on earnings ?Thumbs up for up after releaseThumbs down for down after release
I don't understand today's huge sell off. Anyone has any idea what could have happend?
"I believe ORCL is a sleeping giant and may be at an inflection point here. They have enormous untapped potential in cloud computing. Their net margin is 25 percent, operating margin is 35 percent, gross margin is 80 percent. The company trades at a discount to intrinsic value and that is backed up both by its 14 PE and its nearly 7 percent free cash flow yield. The company has little debt, 43 billion in cash, and 11.6 billion free cash flow. What’s not to like?"
Don't understand why ORCL shares are still falling after they've won the appeal against Google
"Typical ORCL report. Oracle beats, stock goes down. Profitable, solid numbers, nice dividend.Needs more top line growth but will slowly come back and be at $85-$87 level again only to drop again at the next earnings call."

InvestorPlace: Powerful Cash Flow Can Push Oracle Stock to $118.https://investorplace.com/2021/07/powerful-cash-flow-can-push-orcl-stock-to-118/
How long will it take for Oracle to reach its high price target of $113 ? Nobody knows.
"Oracle Cloud strategy is very powerful and compelling for SMB and Enterprises, FULLY Managed Apps and Infra, such as DB.Oracle is the KING Enterprise Software, so they should do well."
"Wow it has 0 impact from $ORCL result.Likely one of first company reporting delay in order. I think main reason is, Most other technology stocks are heavily depend on subscriptions and so trend normally delayed by few months at least. If anyone think companies who saw sudden near 0 revenue from very profitable revenue continue spend on technology even higher level, it's fool's world.Also what April/May done which probably another reason other companies not reporting impact, one who not as much impacted and have 1000's employee WFH brought whole bunch of subscriptions (many may not continue as company review spending)What that mean, un-impacted industry you may reach peak potential which wasn't far given hyper growth in last 5 year.I think QQQ will significantly under-perform to $SPY for years to come. People looking at result and think technology is place to be.Most of these technologies companies are Cloud and Cloud based software. Many cases those cloud cost isn't cost effective when compare owning server and many company complain about keep raising cloud bill without really any expansion. Regarding Cloud based software, Most of software, you can find much cheaper open source alternative and any company challenged in this economy will move to open source solutions to save money.In next few months hyper growth will look thing of past."
"DONE DEAL DONE FOR SURE Treasury, Oracle, ByteDance agree on TikTok terms - reportsSep. 17, 2020 11:23 AM ETOracle Corporation (ORCL)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor1 CommentThe Treasury Dept., TikTok owner ByteDance (BDNCE) and Oracle (ORCL -1%) have a tentative agreement on terms of the bid for the social media app's U.S. operations, according to media reports.Treasury had revisions for the deal, to which the two companies agreed in full, CNBC says.And while White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said President Trump would decide on the deal in 24-36 hours, the new reports are a strong signal of deal approval."
"The State of Calif Supreme Court just declined Oracle's appeal to overturn their case against HPE/HPQ. The original jury verdict was for $3 Billion -years ago, and with interest it is now around $4.5 Billion and accruing interest at the rate of $1 Million a day. Oracle lost the jury trial, the Calif. Court of Appeals case, and then Oracle appealed to the Calif. Supreme Court, which yesterday declined to hear. The US Supreme Court turns down the vast majority of cases that are appealed to them. In Oracle's last SEC filing ( 10Q) they did not mention trying to appeal the Calif. Supreme Court's ruling if it went against them. Only said that if the Calif. Supreme Court denied their appeal, it would be a material event."
"Like many older tech companies with failure to innovate, Oracle is falling behind in its transition to the cloud, has been in the process of transitioning away from its legacy database business and expensive subscription-base cloud business. In a bid protest filed recently in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Oracle argued the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud-computing contract over 10 years, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or “JEDI” for short, has improperly favored Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing unit of Amazon.com. The lawsuit comes just weeks after the Government Accountability Office ruled against an earlier bid protest by Oracle, which had taken issue with the Pentagon’s approach.The recent departure of 22-year Oracle veteran Thomas Kurian, who was in charge of the company’s product development and a key figure in its cloud efforts, was another red flag for many analysts. Originally, the company had said he was taking extended time off. Then, not too long after, Kurian left and joined Alphabet as the head of Google Cloud."
"I LOVE THIS COMPANY, okay I like it but can anyone give me their thoughts on their debt to equity ? What is their plan on lowering it ? Sales? Increasing in prices? Or anyone has any experience when investing in companies with this issue? Interesting in any thoughts. Thanks !"
"The stock was already priced for perfection. Any glitch on the numbers was not going to be well received. I wouldn’t be surprised if it retreated 5%-8% tomorrow, before it recovers most of it back in the weeks to come. If you liked the stock yesterday, this doesn’t change the prospects going forward…"
"SHEP. HERE............................ I gave up on Orcl a few min. ago and sold it. I know the dividend is paid at the end of the week so I will still get that. I put the money into Pfizer. No one tends to like pfe even though it is saving lives, BUT IT GOES EX. DIV. ON THE 28th so by buying today I will get the dividend that will be paid in March. It won't be a rocket because techs are what are making the gains, but it won't fall much either. Earnings are Feb. 2 and since the government gave it so much money, it should do ok. Just my not so humble opinion. Good luck on Orcl. I will be watching it because I have the perfect skill of selling just before something takes off. I will still ask my neighbor the first time I see him about orcl and I will post it on this board. Good luck again to all of you. This is a nice board, unlike the WMT board where I post a lot."
"Not a Oracle shareholder but let me understand. If oracle wins this Tik Tok battle, that would mean that it could potentially be oracles most lucrative product by storing people’s data and presenting them with ads similar to what FB does. The thing is, how long can Tik Tok last before it becomes another my space? I don’t think TT compares to Facebook"
Why can’t Usa create its on new version of Tik Tok name it Ping Pong
Josh Brown on Fast Money Halftime show said he thinks the transformation of Oracle takes it to $100.
I said yesterday that it was a deep discount day...and overreacting market...if you listened you would be 3.5% higher today
$ADBE $ORCL $WIMI Fight back ! Fight for your money ! Fight for you future !
"I'm young, so I haven't the savings to really start investing for my long term future yet- but I'll give those of you long-termers my insight as a young guy, and as cyber/network systems college major. When people think of cloud systems, the first thing they think is backing up pictures, or just general online data storage like Dropbox. Truth is that cloud storage is way more valued then that. Online game servers? Held on cloud systems. Online learning? Held on cloud systems. New apps and digital innovators that need storage but can't afford the internet and storage? They go to cloud companies. Point being is that the cloud is a huge industry, and that is likely a reason why we've seen Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies sky rocket in the last decade. The mistake people are making is that Oracle can't compete. When you charge for cloud storage, your more over charging for a service, not a product. Oracle selling a sought after service leaves very little room for it to underperform."
A minor miss but what is concerning is a decline in the cloud licensing hope to hear more at the top of the hour
"Orcl is like Msft back in 2015 when they started in full force into the cloud. Look at the chart and see. Orcl will be 300 by 2025. Their database runs the most demanding applications in the business. Microsoft and Amazon and Google cannot compete when it comes to large data model with Orcl and win. Orcl has a long way to go to achieve the $1 Trillion market cap. This is a long hold and keep. The money manager started to look at it back in September of last year and finally Barrons' article made the retail investor take a good look. They will become a growth company. Orcl price today is what it was back in 2000. Yet, their cloud business alone is worth more than the closing price on Friday. Orcl will succeed where others cannot compete and their installed base is only 10 percent converted to the cloud. 40 percent of the shares are owned by insider make it the shares less volatile."
Remember when the Oracle message board was mostly crazy political rants? I'd almost prefer that now instead of the opportunistic robo-spammers.
Orcl is my only stock up today…
Pass through $86.Starting to fall.$78 tomorrow?
lose a $3bn verdict (that will be appealed) stock drops $10bn. That makes sense.
"I think I like this better than a Tik Tok sale. Oracle avoided a bidding war and you would think the trustee situation is easier to get done.. Who knows. Oracle is a long time enterprise software leader and is used by everyone. This year was all about going after a larger share of the cloud market. Tik Tok is getting in early with quality services hosted and Oracle takes a big step in scaling. If SalesForce is built on Oracle and the hot new social media site wants to rely on them for everything, I'm calling it a buy."
100$ coming soon!

"Bears I don’t understand. Oracle is like the last undervalued tech stock. However, I do not want to discredit the fact that most software devs hate using Oracle softwares but trends shift all the time. Yes, it might sting in the short term for longs but I see value in Oracle."
"Perhaps the deal is completely off then according to this :--Does anybody honestly believe that all the code will be handed to Oracle and under their total control?""""""""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said if Oracle's deal for TikTok cannot be closed with terms that meet U.S. security requirements, including holding code in the United States, the short video app will be shut down.""All of the code will have to be in the United States. Oracle will be responsible for rebuilding the code, sanitizing the code, making sure it's safe in their cloud, and ...it'll satisfy all of our requirements,"" Mnuchin told a CNBC investor conference."""""
breadcrumbs for longs and caviar for the shorts
"Come and pick me up, I want to get in the car. $ORCL $VENA"
Buy limit order at $65.Should be filled in the next 60 days.
Most shareholders are holding on because it always bounces back by next earnings announcement.
Everyone expects Oracle to drop after the Earnings announcement/ER. Do you know what happens when everyone runs to one side of a boat?
$Oracle Powerful Cash Flow Can Push Oracle Stock to $118
