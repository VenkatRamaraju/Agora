"Buy SWCH , better price!"
"Here was my comment a few months back and now EQIX has a stock price of $100 more:Let me get this right (and please correct me if I'm wrong)…. EQIX has 84 million shares outstanding and the stock is at $550. Does that mean the company is valued at $47.5 BILLIONS dollars??? And the quarterly number was $1.60/share... So, yearly ""might"" be about $500,000??? SO, it might take a little less than 100 years for profits to pay for the companies value??? FED and WALL STREET printing money is pretty SICK and it creates a SLAVE society folks"
bought this one under $100 years ago- sold at like? $190 and then just sold again for a little profit. this could go over $1000. wonder if any of you are old enuf to remember RXT. they are back going public - any thoughts? just IPO'd today. EQIX was competitor back in the day. Data Center rack space...tales of MSFT and GOOGLE data centers were told....then AMZN..... ahhh yes....the olde days of the 2000's ....

"A Car Guy....Why is it that you can remember all those old cars you ever owned. You're back driving that Maroon 49 Ford 2-dr. sedan out in the country and you can still smell the interior and the horses. You're still in that black 69 Mach I, slamming down that 4-speed. You're still in that 35 Ford 2dr. sedan, with the 56 Buick nailhead engine and out south of town lining up to race to race Tank, in his brown 63 Chev 409, 425 horse beast. You're in all those old cars going down the road of Life and they're all talking to you and you have a smile on your face, but the faces of all the old girlfriends are a blur...."

"Don't blame the virus. The market is tanking and will continue to do so because you fools have created such a big bubble. This company, P/E 100. Are you kidding me."
"Looking like a short is in place... Top executives are selling tons of shares. Also, revenue was short of estimates last quarter. Lots of room to FALLLLLLLLL Probably 400 will be the entry point next"
The company can’t even sell $2 billion and analysts have it jacked up over $70 billion value... how stupid are you???
What's up? All glowing reports except one IHS Markit Score and the stock tanks. Even IHS had all positive remarks but inexplicably downgraded its ranking.
EQIX was at $487 less than two weeks ago. it's now at $645 and is approaching its 52 week high.
Barclays downgraded this stock price...unbelievable!! $1000/year end.
EQIX is down -5.22% to 413.07
"anyone ever uncover what truly happened to CEO Smith ?? Not that the Company misses him -- just curious. Likely an inappropriate affair. Since his days at EDS he was a little ""sketchy""."
With a 3.4% death rate... and all the intl. techies walking in the doors of this place... The government might lock the doors on this place. Think about it?!

"The media (like Oprah) is looking into wall street companies that don't hire many minorities since the Fed is using the tax payers money to fund the ""market"" now. We'll see if EQIX can show they are an equal opportunity employer? Is this company honoring Junesixteenth with its employees??"

SPHS is a BO for 2 Billion with a small cap!!!
"Pump it up FED! EQIX... missed numbers last three quarters, valued over 65 billion dollars with less than $400 million in annual profits, PE in the 130 range, NO minorities on the board, handling US Governments information and also the private sector in the US and overseas (so overseas Gov. are looking at them), real estate stocks are going to dive because of virus. This company is ripe for a HUGE dump"

"My portfolio $INDI, $Z, $MSFT, $COST, $JPM, $EQIX, $SWKS, $AMZN. INDI is by far the most explosive one I own, with largest upside."
"With all of the $800-$900 price targets why aren't any analysts writing about this decline, even if it is temporary. You'd think a good analyst would see this as a great entry point. Lazy sell-side...Yahoo cannot censor people who don't disobey their terms of service, yahoo is begging for a lawsuit."
Again... can anyone tell me if EQIX has any minorities on it’s board??? The top executives seem silent about the movement that could take down a company.
"Get a bad feeling on this one. Growth speed slows down to 7-8%. Competition becomes even worse, unbalanced supply and demand. Bought at 700, I guess we might see this drops to 500 lmao."

I don't think they are a good long term bet as Microsoft are putting their data centres under water. Better for cooling servers if they are submerged and close to the offshore wind turbines. https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/
EQIX is being looked at by every country in the world now because of the new China Spy emergency. Any company that is using EQIX knows that they work directly with the US Government and the Pentegon. There is a serious conflict of interest and it will become known soon.

There is some insider trading in 2019 but apart options only sales so I am not very optimistic about the results for th Q4. and ADX is not very good.
Nothing but Growth ahead for EQIX. what a bargain for such a growth stock. Servers and cloud.New PT and upgrades are on the way.

"Stealing marbles from the new kidat St. Joes. A new 3rd grader showed up at school with a cigar box half filled with beautiful cat eyes. i knew we would end up with them, since we all played for keeps. He lived a block away from school and a block away from me. Those cat eyes kept creeping into my head, so early one saturday morning i went over and stole his cat eyes from under his steps. An hour later, the ""Thou shalt not steal"" thing came roaring back at my mind, so i took them back.A month later, he moved away and we only won a few of those marbles...."

"Just browsing different reits. Does EQIX pay 1.67% yield ? Normally I believe reits have to pay 90% of their net earnings as dividends, most other REITS I’ve looked at pay 8% or higher. Am I missing something ? I’m a new investor, just trying to learn how this works. Thanks for any feedback."

Another MISS... analysts are pretty stupid on this one. I think that’s 3 of last 4 quarters. Rents are due and companies are not going to be able to pay. Governments around the world are also looking at EQIX‘a. Relationship with the Pentagon

Internet usage is still growing.Your guess maybe right.SWCH can go to 25/share next year or late. Data Center is in demanding at the present.

EQIX is a security issue for evey country they have a data center in since they share data with the US government. It runs through their network. Trump is creating an anti data collection/transfer campaign and EQIX is right in the cross hairs of it

"Canaccord analyst Paul Morgan raised his price target on Equinix to $525 from $465 following meetings with management. The analyst said he sees near-term upside from the portfolio's top asset, selling into 600 new customer logos, and absorbing capacity from other locations. Morgan sees Equinix as well positioned to deliver double digit secular growth."
