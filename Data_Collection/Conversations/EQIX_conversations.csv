"Let me get this right (and please correct me if I'm wrong)…. EQIX has 84 million shares outstanding and the stock is at $550. Does that mean the company is valued at $47.5 BILLIONS dollars??? And the quarterly number was $1.60/share... So, yearly ""might"" be about $500,000??? SO, it might take a little less than 100 years for profits to pay for the companies value??? FED and WALL STREET printing money is pretty SICK and it creates a SLAVE society folks"

"Canaccord analyst Paul Morgan raised his price target on Equinix to $525 from $465 following meetings with management. The analyst said he sees near-term upside from the portfolio's top asset, selling into 600 new customer logos, and absorbing capacity from other locations. Morgan sees Equinix as well positioned to deliver double digit secular growth."

"Anyone want to comment on 5G or 5th Generation 10,000 Mbps vs The Traditional 4G/4G LTE That Will Be Going Obsolete or Near Obsolete as 5G is Rolled Out In 11 Of The Largest Cities in The USA This Year & How “IF Anyway” EQIX Falls Into Gaining The NEW CONTRACTS when The Tower Boxes Have Slimmed Down to Sit On City Street Lamps And “Other” Infrastructure” Already In Place? The REASON I ASK IS THAT QUESTION IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION EVERYONE SHOULD BE ASKING ABOUT THE COMPANY THAT HAS DONE QUITE WELL SPLIT ADJUSTED @ $3.50 PER SHARE SINCE 2000 and I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANY LONGTERM GAINS GO AWAY WHICH THEY WILL IF THEY ARE NOT SET UP FOR 5G CONTRACTING WITH THE PROPERTIES TO HANDLE 5G. MAYBE, EVERYTHING IS FINE AND THE COMPANY IS GOING TO GROW TO HANDLE “CUTTING THE CORD” THAT HAS LED ME TO SEVERAL BIG WINNERS SUCH AS ROKU A STREAMING MEDIA INTERNET PLATFORM THAT HAS ALREADY DOUBLED THIS YEAR AS CORD CUTTERS ARE GOING TO THE PLATFORM, M&A SPECULATION IS EVERYWHERE WITH REAL DOLLARS ALREADY TURNED DOWN, & THE “MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS” IN BARCELONA HAD CLEARLY STATED HOW 5G IS THE FUTURE AND THE FUTURE IS NOW AS “INTERNALLY” EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY SHAPED UP AS TO WHO IS IN AND WHO IS PARTIALLY IN OR OUT WITH OLDER INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT PERTAINS TO TOWERS WHICH PUTS EQIQ & AMT ON THE SPOT!Thank You For ANY INFORMATION or FACTS That ANYONE HAS.Enjoy The Religious Holliday’s and Summer Vacations etc. and EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD BREAK FROM THE MARKETS!"

"Just browsing different reits. Does EQIX pay 1.67% yield ? Normally I believe reits have to pay 90% of their net earnings as dividends, most other REITS I’ve looked at pay 8% or higher. Am I missing something ? I’m a new investor, just trying to learn how this works. Thanks for any feedback."

Do you believe INTEL and Google will develop a chip?
"Pump it up FED! EQIX... missed numbers last three quarters, valued over 65 billion dollars with less than $400 million in annual profits, PE in the 130 range, NO minorities on the board, handling US Governments information and also the private sector in the US and overseas (so overseas Gov. are looking at them), real estate stocks are going to dive because of virus. This company is ripe for a HUGE dump"
This investment got me 15% now. INMB will be up more than 100 in 4 weeks time.

Wow!
EQIX is being looked at by every country in the world now because of the new China Spy emergency. Any company that is using EQIX knows that they work directly with the US Government and the Pentegon. There is a serious conflict of interest and it will become known soon.
Just covered my short to help you longs a little. Will reshort near 500.
This is a great stock. If for no other reason than the fact that there aren’t a ton of posts in here daily.

Another MISS... analysts are pretty stupid on this one. I think that’s 3 of last 4 quarters. Rents are due and companies are not going to be able to pay. Governments around the world are also looking at EQIX‘a. Relationship with the Pentagon

"Just going to take one comment from an country banning EQIX ""for security reasons"" from doing business for the FALL to happen. Just like Trump is doing to Huawei. Trump will take all the hot air and Wall Street printed money out of this lie"
"Great idea to refinance all the loans and have spare cash because customers are expecting lower rent. Starbucks, the gap... thousands of companies are asking and will close their doors if they don’t get it. Yikes!

"Stealing marbles from the new kidat St. Joes. A new 3rd grader showed up at school with a cigar box half filled with beautiful cat eyes. i knew we would end up with them, since we all played for keeps. He lived a block away from school and a block away from me. Those cat eyes kept creeping into my head, so early one saturday morning i went over and stole his cat eyes from under his steps. An hour later, the ""Thou shalt not steal"" thing came roaring back at my mind, so i took them back.A month later, he moved away and we only won a few of those marbles...."
WS jerks trashed this for zero reason.

"A Car Guy....Why is it that you can remember all those old cars you ever owned. You're back driving that Maroon 49 Ford 2-dr. sedan out in the country and you can still smell the interior and the horses. You're still in that black 69 Mach I, slamming down that 4-speed. You're still in that 35 Ford 2dr. sedan, with the 56 Buick nailhead engine and out south of town lining up to race to race Tank, in his brown 63 Chev 409, 425 horse beast. You're in all those old cars going down the road of Life and they're all talking to you and you have a smile on your face, but the faces of all the old girlfriends are a blur...."
"Get a bad feeling on this one. Growth speed slows down to 7-8%. Competition becomes even worse, unbalanced supply and demand. Bought at 700, I guess we might see this drops to 500 lmao."
With a 3.4% death rate... and all the intl. techies walking in the doors of this place... The government might lock the doors on this place. Think about it?!

EQIX is a security issue for evey country they have a data center in since they share data with the US government. It runs through their network. Trump is creating an anti data collection/transfer campaign and EQIX is right in the cross hairs of it
Why in hell is this now so cheap?
