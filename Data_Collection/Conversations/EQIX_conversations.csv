EQIX is down -5.65% to 400.15
Internet usage is still growing.Your guess maybe right.SWCH can go to 25/share next year or late. Data Center is in demanding at the present.
Barclays downgraded this stock price...unbelievable!! $1000/year end.
Why such a big hit today?
"Get a bad feeling on this one. Growth speed slows down to 7-8%. Competition becomes even worse, unbalanced supply and demand. Bought at 700, I guess we might see this drops to 500 lmao."
"Anyone want to comment on 5G or 5th Generation 10,000 Mbps vs The Traditional 4G/4G LTE That Will Be Going Obsolete or Near Obsolete as 5G is Rolled Out In 11 Of The Largest Cities in The USA This Year & How “IF Anyway” EQIX Falls Into Gaining The NEW CONTRACTS when The Tower Boxes Have Slimmed Down to Sit On City Street Lamps And “Other” Infrastructure” Already In Place? The REASON I ASK IS THAT QUESTION IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION EVERYONE SHOULD BE ASKING ABOUT THE COMPANY THAT HAS DONE QUITE WELL SPLIT ADJUSTED @ $3.50 PER SHARE SINCE 2000 and I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANY LONGTERM GAINS GO AWAY WHICH THEY WILL IF THEY ARE NOT SET UP FOR 5G CONTRACTING WITH THE PROPERTIES TO HANDLE 5G. MAYBE, EVERYTHING IS FINE AND THE COMPANY IS GOING TO GROW TO HANDLE “CUTTING THE CORD” THAT HAS LED ME TO SEVERAL BIG WINNERS SUCH AS ROKU A STREAMING MEDIA INTERNET PLATFORM THAT HAS ALREADY DOUBLED THIS YEAR AS CORD CUTTERS ARE GOING TO THE PLATFORM, M&A SPECULATION IS EVERYWHERE WITH REAL DOLLARS ALREADY TURNED DOWN, & THE “MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS” IN BARCELONA HAD CLEARLY STATED HOW 5G IS THE FUTURE AND THE FUTURE IS NOW AS “INTERNALLY” EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY SHAPED UP AS TO WHO IS IN AND WHO IS PARTIALLY IN OR OUT WITH OLDER INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT PERTAINS TO TOWERS WHICH PUTS EQIQ & AMT ON THE SPOT!Thank You For ANY INFORMATION or FACTS That ANYONE HAS.Enjoy The Religious Holliday’s and Summer Vacations etc. and EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD BREAK FROM THE MARKETS!"
What's up with the decline to EQIX after hours?

"EQIX EQUINOX is zombie company with high risk, overvalued stock and slow growth."
The pre-market activity on this stock is so weird sometimes :D
Which company in China is the China-EQIX?
ready for the sell off!? Haha. This is a $720 and under stock. People will take profits soon
"Short list getting longer $SAVA $EQIX $DASH $NOW list keeps expanding. EQIX has a P/E of 220 or 1,000% more than the S&P 500"
This thing never goes down. I want in but...
"Just browsing different reits. Does EQIX pay 1.67% yield ? Normally I believe reits have to pay 90% of their net earnings as dividends, most other REITS I’ve looked at pay 8% or higher. Am I missing something ? I’m a new investor, just trying to learn how this works. Thanks for any feedback."
"Will there ever be a stock split??Just wondering. Would love to invest in this company. But too rich for my blood. Not interested in fractional shares, btw."
Do you believe INTEL and Google will develop a chip?
"CMG down ,SHOP next to tumble..someone made these 2 as religions..you can not go against them...i see em bowing big time"
"anyone ever uncover what truly happened to CEO Smith ?? Not that the Company misses him -- just curious. Likely an inappropriate affair. Since his days at EDS he was a little ""sketchy""."
SWCH is better
"Buy SWCH , better price!"
What's up? All glowing reports except one IHS Markit Score and the stock tanks. Even IHS had all positive remarks but inexplicably downgraded its ranking.
"Just going to take one comment from an country banning EQIX ""for security reasons"" from doing business for the FALL to happen. Just like Trump is doing to Huawei. Trump will take all the hot air and Wall Street printed money out of this lie"
"This is directly from Equinix's website: Equinix is the leading strategic data center platform for government solutions, hosting the largest network of facilities, clouds and service providers.Connect and protect data and workloads in direct support of U.S. government initiatives, standards and compliance requirements."
What happened today? Why
"Let me get this right (and please correct me if I'm wrong)…. EQIX has 84 million shares outstanding and the stock is at $550. Does that mean the company is valued at $47.5 BILLIONS dollars??? And the quarterly number was $1.60/share... So, yearly ""might"" be about $500,000??? SO, it might take a little less than 100 years for profits to pay for the companies value??? FED and WALL STREET printing money is pretty SICK and it creates a SLAVE society folks"
Why EQIX going down 2 days in a row folks?
"With all of the $800-$900 price targets why aren't any analysts writing about this decline, even if it is temporary. You'd think a good analyst would see this as a great entry point. Lazy sell-side...Yahoo cannot censor people who don't disobey their terms of service, yahoo is begging for a lawsuit."
"I bought so its probably going to fall a lot more from here $649----lmao, but soooooo tru"

"My portfolio $INDI, $Z, $MSFT, $COST, $JPM, $EQIX, $SWKS, $AMZN. INDI is by far the most explosive one I own, with largest upside."
"Here was my comment a few months back and now EQIX has a stock price of $100 more:Let me get this right (and please correct me if I'm wrong)…. EQIX has 84 million shares outstanding and the stock is at $550. Does that mean the company is valued at $47.5 BILLIONS dollars??? And the quarterly number was $1.60/share...

FED and WALL STREET printing money is pretty SICK and it creates a SLAVE society folks"
EQIX bubble about to burst
What’s up with the 6% increase in the post market ? Again a scam like Tuesday pre-market where the stocks hit 27% high ?
"That was weird...the ticker indicated it was $74 at one point. Marc, did you see the same thing?"
This is a great stock. If for no other reason than the fact that there aren’t a ton of posts in here daily.
Wow!
Down 3% today along with everything real estate and nobody knows why
Oversold. RSI 29. Good entry point.
