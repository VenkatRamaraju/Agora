I'm wondering if I should just take my loss and move to more promising stocks"

When you blindly attack everything and everyone with abandon, A higher power weighs this into a life’s equation. I don’t wish I’ll on anyone, but when you upset the balance of decency bad things happen. It’s sad?? Nobody asked this dingy to lash out against a whole office, she offended decency and it is what it is"
