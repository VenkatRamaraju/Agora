ManpowerGroup is up 6.56% to 79.26
"Very strange price action again. Lower Rev, lower earnings. It shows the economy is still contracting. Todays share volume tells me the CBOE is burning people on the floor to help stock valuations. This market is rigged if you ask me. Read the financials people. https://investor.manpowergroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/manpowergroup-reports-3rd-quarter-2019-results"
"MAN has gone from $95 to $75 since Sep. Fortuntately I didn't buy at the top but at mid 80's. Is there any hope for this stock? or is it all downside from here (Q3 missing on Rev, and probably the labor market peaking) ? I'm wondering if I should just take my loss and move to more promising stocks"
MAN is up 5.50% to 94.17
Man bought 20 million and it still tanks just like others. This isn't the only stock I know buying back shares and still declining.
Does anyone know why this stock reacts this way to earnings reports?
"I am a beginning investor so there has got to be something I do not understand here.....with the pandemic and so many out of work, it appears Manpower should be set to roar back.....in addition the PEG ratio is very unusually low. I was told to look for stocks with PEG ratio 1.5 and lower.....with that simple view, this looks like a goldmine at .28. What am I missing?"
"So Man’s debt 10 years ago was $700 million now more than double , yet cash is same level??? Perplexing model, I imagine this is why Brokerage are steering clear ??"
"I Will be sharing verified info that will shock you about this company’s upper mgt... hold tight , the financials are public info it’s all out there!!"
Time to short MAN it will crumble by next quarter
"This one is heading lower, cannot put a silk hat on a pig  things are deteriorating not improving"
"MAN go soon back to the old level, Virus problems will be solved in 6 coming months."

Coronavirus is going create a HUGE demand for workforce. hiring always lags the market by 6 months
ManPower $MAN up nicely today - hopefully a sign of things to come with STAF.
with so many people out of work this company has huge potential.
Will close red by the end of day
Stock has systematically sold off a few points at a time from $92 to where it is today $68???? It’s puzzling perhaps Jeff needs to step back in to take the reigns until the storm is over??
