"let's do the math together. 50,000.00 / 1.33 = 37593 shares. 37593 shares x 2.10 = 78,947 $ 28,000.00 in one week. take that 28k set it aside. Take the 50k and buy again, this time it went as low as 1.40 which would give you 35714 shares and then sell it at 1.92 = 68,571.00 18,500.00 profit. Take the 18k set it aside and reuse the 50k all over again. No matter what Drys is here to stay, and it will get higher. This is big business people. B$$$$$g Business. Let's all make money. I'm at hold position till it hits 2.40 next week or even higher."

"TSLA's huge gain is probably Greenlight covering. Einhorn had a win and let it slip through his fingers. He's been super wrong on growth stocks, and just as wrong on long energy stocks. Hang it up and wind GLRE down, David. The world has changed."
I would like to know observations of shareholders here for Friday's sell off. Thanks.

GE finally doing the layoffs that are two years too late. Selling profitable business divisions for cash was never a strategy to rescue the company. The only real strategies GE had available was to fire workers or issue stock in the billions which they refused to do. GE was destroyed by Immelt and his management team and Ed Garden and his crew who blew a hundred billion on dividends and buybacks largely from cash that was supposed to be contributed to its pension. Now the final nail in the coffin is in the hand of the current management team.
