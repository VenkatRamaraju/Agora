"Will be glad to dump this stock, it essentially does nothing. Where is the growth? The people running this company don't know what they are doing, no way it should still be tossing out mediocre report after mediocre report. It should be growing like a weed!"
This has about at least 45% upward potential. 12/19/2019. price 3.27.

My guess is that G is due for a pullback in the short-run. google awesomeS-TOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.

Is G undervalued? This sort of setup suggests potential upside... This is so frustrating trying to find trade ideas. I've subscribed to some email newsletters which helps me with new stock ideas. https://awesomepickstoday1.blogspot.com/ is the one i like best.

Past couple years G has steadily gained about a dollar to a dollar 50 a month I noticed the trend so I bought some semi conservative options for the end of the month I think my break even was under 18 today it drops 3 bucks hahahahaha. This is reoccurring just happened with aimt and Iâ€™m sure it will happen with my pcg contracts. No more options for this guy
"let's do the math together. 50,000.00 / 1.33 = 37593 shares. 37593 shares x 2.10 = 78,947 $ 28,000.00 in one week. take that 28k set it aside. Take the 50k and buy again, this time it went as low as 1.40 which would give you 35714 shares and then sell it at 1.92 = 68,571.00 18,500.00 profit. Take the 18k set it aside and reuse the 50k all over again. No matter what Drys is here to stay, and it will get higher. This is big business people. B$$$$$g Business. Let's all make money. I'm at hold position till it hits 2.40 next week or even higher."
"All of the analysts have capitulated on this stock, with M###g@@ar giving it it's lowest rating of 1, and declaring it fully valued at 8 or 9 bucks. At the other extreme, is the internet's beggest discount broker named after Chuck (the first name of its owner). They've got Teck rated at A1. (About 5% of the stocks in its universe receive an A rating, and most are rated A2 and below--down to A5.) For them to hold on to an A1 rating amounts to ""courageous conviction."" Sometimes they're right and everyone else is wrong. Sometimes, as in the case of WEC (which has carried an F100 rating for the past several years) they may be right--but only after another 5-10 years have gone by. In the meantime, I've been buying small amounts on a regular basis, and despite buying on the way up, and paying several dozen commission fees, the value of my WEC has doubled!Stock-picking isn't a science. it's a game of future ""probabilities"" based on past results. That's why Bogle and Buffett are buy-and-hold, index fund believers. Individual stocks, and daily checking-up on them, is for people looking for excitement."

"Coot--Good analysis . RMTI's complaint was filed in US District Court Eastern District of Michigan . Read it and draw your own conclusions . My conclusion , in addition to being a PIG; Chioini is a #$%$##g, who will do anything to keep his snout in the trough--including screwing RMTI shareholder --s"
The last time G did something like this it blew up. if you guys have questions you should ask awe-someSTOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.

GE finally doing the layoffs that are two years too late. Selling profitable business divisions for cash was never a strategy to rescue the company. The only real strategies GE had available was to fire workers or issue stock in the billions which they refused to do. GE was destroyed by Immelt and his management team and Ed Garden and his crew who blew a hundred billion on dividends and buybacks largely from cash that was supposed to be contributed to its pension. Now the final nail in the coffin is in the hand of the current management team.
