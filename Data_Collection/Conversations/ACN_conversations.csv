What happened?
forget what the pump and dumpster's are saying here ... the stock is heading up as it approaches earnings report in December. And take a look at that delicious dividend for holders long or short term that is. Not the shorts but the people holding the stock for short periods of time like swing Traders who will also benefit from the dividend payout.

"Is part of ACN's dividend withheld by Ireland? I know the UK doesn't withhold, and some Ireland companies have their dividends withheld and some don't. Some companies have deals with Ireland that keeps them from withholding."
"I want to start position too, this is one of the least beta stock... but... i wish this can go to $220"
is anybody here? a great qtr for ACN. The dividend raise is a total shocker in this environment and their guidance was not that bad given the situation. it is good to be invested in companies with low debt
"Promising Consulting CompanyCartesian (CRTN), one of my top holdings, is worth consideration by investors. In business since 1990, Cartesian specializes in the telecommunications, media, and technology sector. They offer insight and advice, and help transform the products, services and organizations in these industries. Beginning November 2017, after management change, Cartesian is run by a new leader, Donald J Tringali, a Harvard Law School graduate with years of experience (previously Chief Operating Officer of Telemundo, responsible for all business operations and strategic initiatives).

Why the sell-off yesterday?
I worked for Accenture and I can't understand how any company would hire them.They blow up companies.Google them. You'll see a long list of million dollar blow ups...
Expensive on historical PE but got to believe the pandemic has accelerated growth by several years not yet reflected in earnings. They're hiring extensively surely anticipating the demand.

Enron brought me here...
ACN 164.3.. Great short here.. this is just earnings.. they have to do the same thing over next qtr to keep these numbers.. ACN is just a body shop.. they push out guys to do the work and take money off the rate.. They do not produce.. do not be fooled.. SHORT HERE.. SHORT.. we should see 155 in 1 week..

Accenture has been making all the right moves. Nothing but positive earnings and growth in revenue. Has been rated a ‘Buy’ by many entities that matter. Not sure why the price is this low. Looks like a bargain right now if you ask me.

Fantastic run for a well run company. 300 is around the corner.
Out of all the clouds services Accenture has the LEAST exposure! Too much of a sell off. Once people realize that ACN is least exposed this will snap back quickly. Time to buy.
