Great earnings and less than a 1% pop. WTH?
Go buy Lionsgate and AMC Networks. Great content and A lot cheaper than Viacom.
Is broadband in the infrastructure bill thz
Comcast’s acquisition of Masergy is spectacular for the enterprise business group. They have purchased the leader in SDWAN among those in the know. Masergy is the best from a technology and customer experience point. Probably less that 1/2 billion in revenue but they bring expertise and LARGE customers. Good job Comcast!
The writing is on the wall.SELL CBS- so that COMCAST can acquire them. $cmcsa
"C'mon, let the big dog eat!! Way to go Comcast!! Quite a fantastic beat this quarter!! Their share price deserves to be up near a $100 - what a great essential juggernaut of a company they've become and will continue to be!!!"
"interesting phrase from Jeff Shell ""might see acquisitions that will help grow internationally"" what else could they buy?"
The first thing that Xiden asked about when he heard about the suicide bomber is that was he wearing a mask and was he vaccinated. Running the country from the mental hospital
"Motley Fool frames it well, over the past 5 years broadband customers increased by over 7 million, customers decreased less than 4 million. A fantastically profitable formula for great stock price growth for the foreseeable future."

Earnings Earnings Earnings that's all the Street is talking about now. CMCSA will probably over achieve again like always. Why isnt this stock over $100????
"Wow SEC Network, Big Ten, PAC 12 all in the Elite plan with all the classic non-sports stations can you say college football? This is an unreal deal through $FUBO this isn’t something $NFLX offers. Comcast offers it at a much much higher price $CMCSA"
"Many ""streamers"" are up today: $AMC, $VIAC, $DISCA, $LGF-A, $CHTR, $NFLX, $CMCSA and don't forget good ol' $ROKU"
with now this rumours of discussions of Brian Roberts and Shari redstone of combining their streaming service overseas do you think Brian will spun off NBCUniversal and merged it with $Viac $Viaca or will buy Viacomcbs
Don’t know what I would do without (http://financialdeals.tech). Their daily emails give me all the info I need to make the most of my trades!
now with the M&A frenzy going on do you think Brian Roberts will stay true to his words and not pursue anything or will he spin off NBCUniversal or buy something else after the deal of Warnermedia with Discovery is closed?
Quiz time: How long do you think Comcast will stay with NBCUniversal before selling it or Spins Off i say by 2022 after the Warnermedia Discovery deal is done Comcast will make it's move

"Maybe not huge considering the scope of Comcast, but they have a deal that was pretty much completed today that will positively impact their bottom line by about 7Billion. Hopefully sp will move nicely next week. Even a slight move of the needle is good."
Stock is setting a nice baseline and looking to bust into the 60’s after strong earnings.
Best quarter for Comcast coming up
"IMHO, in August we will see some small correction. Anyone with me? No need to insult to disagree, just wondering how others feel about the market. GLTA! $MA $V $GOOGL $AMZN $CMCSA $JPM $SQ $VOO"
If the market as a whole doesn’t have a correction Comcast will be in the $70. Range by September of 2022 (13 months from now)
I'm opening a class action lawsuit against comcast. Their tech support makes customers incur unnecessary expense to prove their routers are defective. I've had 3 instances in the past month and $2800 of unpaid bills that are comcast induced troubleshooting. If anyone else out there has instances of this please reply.
Reiterate: This stock will be at or near $70. by next summer providing the the whole market does not correct. Great investment and you can sleep at night owning it.

"The key to a successful sports betting platform is having an already established user base (approx. 700k streamers subscribed!) and 900k expected by year end. This user base can be parlayed into sports betting and even sports NFTs down the road if they company so chooses to explore this area. DraftKings $DKNG is doing sports NFTs currently and it's a massive success for them. FUBO is also backed by Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS, think this is huge? YES."
Comcast is doing an incredible job bringing us the Olympics. It must be a super complicated endeavor to bring this into our living rooms half way across the world. I am glad I am not the Director.
"Time for Comcast to catch up to being over valued like all the rest!! C'mon Institutions, lots of head room going up here... this is a great place to park your client's big bucks!! Let's go already!!"
I'm going to switch from $CMCSA Comcast cable to $FUBO on my smart 4k TV
$30 million per year to Rachel Maddow for a weekly show is outrageous. The NBC executives that negotiated this new contract should be fired. It is totally NOT in the interest of shareholders to pay this excessive salary. BTW Comcast ownes NBC if you did not know.
"3:10 to Yuma leaving the station. Think of friends and family that can switch to FuboTV “Elite” package on their smart tvs and still have sports and Fox News, etc. even Big Ten Network etc. no wonder $CMCSA owns part of FUBO"
In 12-14 months this stock will be in the $70. range. The nice part about it is that you get paid to wait with a decent dividend and you can sleep at night with this solid performer.
Staying long here!

why did it jump to 60
Maybe Comcast $CMCSA can talk to TBS and TNT about joining up with FUBO
CNBC Wilford Frost and Morgan make a good team. I watched them today. She is much improved and eye candy smart and bubbly. Those two are good together.
FierceTelecom reported that Comcast received 2 more DoD contracts worth $155M.
