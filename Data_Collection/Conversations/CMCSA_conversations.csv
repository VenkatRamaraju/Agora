Buy under $52
"What's going on, little dip here"
David Faber on CNBC said Comcast CEO about people who are moving tend to not renew their cable.
"If I had had a huge crowd yelling to kill me, I wouldn't turn the yell upside down like: (Pence's refusal to overturn the election was met with chants of ""hang Mike Pence"" from rioters at the Capitol that day.)The press wants ""to use that one day to try and demean the character and intentions of 74 million Americans Say WHAT! The intentions, IMO, clearly stated, of the actual number were to kill Pence, if they found him that day. Maybe he's right, 74 million wanted him hung."
Joe Kernan has no business on CNBC…FOX? maybe
who will buy viacom?
"Well Fargo Analyst STEVEN CAHALL keeps a sell rating on CMCSA with $46 target...he has had a sell rating on this for a long time....like a mission!! ...this dingo cut his price target on Disney for $155 to $107 last april...and before you know it, Disney went to 180s is a short few months...wonder who hires and why pay these guys for their worthless analysis...."
Super heavy volume right at close what happened?
"Shame on CNBC's resident stock manipulator Jim Cramer. Cramer was talking his book last year on CNBC when he claimed that cancer had been cured. Hasbro said on Tuesday longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner has died, two days after he went on medical leave. In a statement last year, Goldner said he had been under continued medical treatment following his cancer diagnosis in 2014."
"Interesting about Gabelli Funds talking Comcast being inflation safe and having a wide moat. If you think about it, broadband is all the rage and there is no bigger broadband provider than CMCSA. And I don't think inflation is rampant on the amount of bandwidth CMCSA has at its disposal to serve customers. The cost of a bit is not skyrocketing and that is what Comcast profits on."
didn't they just posted good Q3 earnings??
74 million shares were short the stock looks like some covering on the drop below $50-support at $48.15
"All I see is buy, don’t complain it’s down when it’s an opportunity to buy. As soon as it spikes you’ll miss buying days."
They had some interesting insights about CMCSA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"I'm a long position investor. / Stock prices will rise as time goes by for internet, IR security, movies, theme parks. / The cable business isn't doing well right now, but there are a lot of sources that are worth the money."
All the cable stocks are down. Comcast leading the way. Drop is tied to a comment made by Comcast CFO at investor conference about a small slowdown on internet growth. Total over reaction by the market. Growth is still strong but difficult to keep up with 2020 Covid growth of people staying home because of Covid. Growth comparable to 2019. It is all good. Shares at a bit of a discount today.
This is a forever stock. Look at the history. Grow grow grow split grow grow split. It split at 72 I believe a couple of years ago and slowly makes wealth. There are people who would go hungry before they cancel cancel their cable bill. Unbelievable cash flow. And don’t forget. One of if not the largest fiber / Ethernet / telecom companies in the USA

I don't know why you would sell after it's down 6%. I see no reason why this can't get back above $59
"SKY Glass looks interesting when Brian Roberts says he is all-in on NBCUniversal and SKY analysts don't believe it well from the new peacock president, a new partnership of Universal parks with Pokemon and now SKY Glass Comcast is really becoming agressive and looks like Brian Roberts doesn't want to give up that assets."
"Commie propaganda is a bad investment, just look at T shares this year. Get out while you can, you've been warned. 5G will be the final nail in the coffin for this stock, but NBC is already dragging it down under-performing cable operating peers that don't own commie propaganda outlets."
this is a great stock but in 5 days of the week 4 of them is red i must wonder what is happening.
Advertising revenue is high margin! Here we go! There’s a big reason Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS owns shares in $FUBO
The premium streaming platform is so weak. I have 5 services and peacock is the worst. they just need to fix it and get out of their 1990s tv mindset.
Why has this great stock/company lost $ almost $ 10.00 per share in the last month ? Does not make a lot of sense ?
"Definitely a great buy. Comcast is #1 Fiber optic / Ethernet provider in the country. Their coax broadband is always talked about, but residences aren’t cutting broadband they are cancelling cable TV. Comcast business, comcast home, NBC, universal pictures/ studios SKY in Europe, comcast resold wireless. Buy on the news."
CMCSA will retreat to $48.00 by EOY. Buy in Jan 22 under $45.00.
This should not be swinging like a speculative stock this quick. Do not like. Let's go brandon
I'm long
as of today Universal Beijing Resort the newest Comcast theme park is officially open and at capacity.
so Hulu president just left the company and is reportedly in negotiations with NBCUniversal to be a senior executive probably overseeing Peacock with this move i think sometime soon enough we will see $DIS buy $CMCSA stake in HULU.
Wells Fargo is the epitome of a fraudulent company that scammed many of their customers and now this character is dispensing BS about Comcast. This character is like a carnival huckster!
"Asset of VIAC is valuable and only a matter of time before it is picked up by $CMCSA, $NFLX, $DIS, $AAPL, or $AMZN. Fully expect it to go the way of FOX. A lot of the players trying to enter streaming would really love the library VIAC has that spans all ages and categories"
"Complete overreaction, Insiders should Buy on this sell off. Solid Company for the Long Term. Very reasonable Valuation unlike other Junk!"
What happened it went from +5% to -5% in PM like in 1 minute :(
$DIS continuing rising prices will drive people for Universal theme parks saw already people saying they will drop Disney for Universal $CMCSA
"This is a total bs, no reason for it to go down this much"
"For you bashers, are you sure you are right? Not only the theme park @Ruben mentions yesterday, CMCSA just announced record price for a 30 second Superbowl Ad spot of $6.5M and the Winter Olympics ads are nearly sold out. Both are in Feb 2022. There may be more upgrades in the near future."
Get the real reason cable shares are down: They're being obsolete by streaming! Losing Ad revenue right left and center. And ATT is digging 1000's of miles of fiber with which coaxial cable or wireless can't compete for internet service to serve the streaming.
"Buy the dip here... I think cmcsa earnings are on Oct 25th? Could be interesting- I'm betting its gonna be a good one, with bright forecasts. Smart $ will move on this prior to $48"
