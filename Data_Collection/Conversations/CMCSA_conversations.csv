"The months preceding.....The 3rd and 4th Quarters following the Olympics are always the best time to buy Comcast. Q3 and Q4 following the Olympics are the best quarters ever for Comcast/NBCU...plus 2021 Gives us not only the Olympics, but also SURGING theme park attendance for the next 12 months."

this is a great stock but in 5 days of the week 4 of them is red i must wonder what is happening.
Boycotting still!
cable stocks are defensive in a shaky market and Comcast is a cheap stock in a expensive market
Every stock green today except Comcast
still jumping target 80
from what I'm seeing is from the BofA conference $CMCSA said they saw a slowdown of net adds in the end of August.
"No it wont go back yet. Capital Markets have to return their investment funds to their clients because of the new tax reform. ""Sell enough for the profit"", and long enough for it to lose value. this way they wont have to be taxed heavily. *hint"
"Commie propaganda is a bad investment, just look at T shares this year. Get out while you can, you've been warned. 5G will be the final nail in the coffin for this stock, but NBC is already dragging it down under-performing cable operating peers that don't own commie propaganda outlets."
$30 million per year to Rachel Maddow for a weekly show is outrageous. The NBC executives that negotiated this new contract should be fired. It is totally NOT in the interest of shareholders to pay this excessive salary. BTW Comcast ownes NBC if you did not know.

$INTC $BA $CMCSA Should I sell or should I hold (featuring The Clash)?
Comcast has lost $48 billion from its high way more than $31 billion proposed Bid for sky.
"alright I think I'm starting to get annoyed with the Wall Street analysts and others analysts saying $CMCSA should spun out NBCU like NBCU is dragging Comcast behind $CMCSA isn't $T with that massive debt and besides Comcast has proved to be competent with their assets of course $CMCSA is probably going to spin off NBCU in a couple of years although I don't think they need, NBCU is a powerhouse now thanks to $CMCSA."

I'm opening a class action lawsuit against comcast. Their tech support makes customers incur unnecessary expense to prove their routers are defective. I've had 3 instances in the past month and $2800 of unpaid bills that are comcast induced troubleshooting. If anyone else out there has instances of this please reply.
Why is no one talking about earnings tomorrow morning?
who bought at the top 44?
Can someone explain that this company’s earnings are higher than Netflix but share price is low? Is it good entry point ? Do u recommend it ?
It looks like sellers gave everyone an opportunity to buy shares yesterday.
Stock is setting a nice baseline and looking to bust into the 60’s after strong earnings.
"I have just started nibbling this stock on dips based on a Barrons article last weekend... Of note,“Comcast is undervalued by almost $100 billion,” says Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group in New York. That $100 billion estimate—based on his sum-of-the-parts analysis—translates into more than $20 a share. He has a Buy rating on the stock and a $55 price target, one of the highest on Wall Street. (The shares closed on Thursday at $34.17.)I nibbled at 34.11, was regretting it almost instantly and then nibbled today at 32.95... Are most the people here bulls? it appears that way. I also watch Century Link and own quite a bit of that due to its current valuation... In the midst of difficulty finding value in today's markets I see these two companies quite interesting.....thoughts?"
"YA ! 50 bucks coming. i always hated Comcast, way overvalued. my opinion"

When we go back to $42.00 ?
Go buy Lionsgate and AMC Networks. Great content and A lot cheaper than Viacom.
"Of course, I'm no genius when it comes to analytics, doing DD on fundamentals or understanding all the financial numbers, but I do read a lot and look at many professional's ratings. What I've read is that there's many money managers out there that have a Buy rating, very few have hold and a miniscule of them with a sell rating. That's a lotta money brains going in one direction. They think Comcast stock price is well worth $50, one reported $64. Some are downright giddy about Comcast, like it's a hidden gem, others a bit more conservative. I know most companies can't please everyone, however I think most try to do their best. Either way, regardless of a natural amount of negative experiences with them, this investment looks like there's a lot of positive fundamentals, words and excitement happening right now and for years to come! I could eat some crow on this later, but this doesn't feel like some pump 'n dump - these guys are just too big for that and they'll be around for quite some time. For me, I'm gonna go with the flow on this one! "
Comcast customer service continues to deteriorate. Spent 6 hours in their chatroom with 7 different people and still have not resolved my internet service problems. Comcast is imploding.
They had some interesting insights about CMCSA on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2018-- Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA), a leading cable, entertainment and communications company, announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 a share on the company’s common stock. The quarterly dividend is payable on January 23, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 2, 2019."
"Motley Fool frames it well, over the past 5 years broadband customers increased by over 7 million, customers decreased less than 4 million. A fantastically profitable formula for great stock price growth for the foreseeable future."
All the cable stocks are down. Comcast leading the way. Drop is tied to a comment made by Comcast CFO at investor conference about a small slowdown on internet growth. Total over reaction by the market. Growth is still strong but difficult to keep up with 2020 Covid growth of people staying home because of Covid. Growth comparable to 2019. It is all good. Shares at a bit of a discount today.
enjoyed the reporting of elizabeth holmes....
how many of you think Comcast is undervalued
Maybe Comcast $CMCSA can talk to TBS and TNT about joining up with FUBO
finally $CMCSA is starting to invest in Peacock they should've done this since the start
"To be honest, CMCSA is undervalued .Great buy ! Should trend up pretty soon."
"Shorts don’t understand the huge potential of FUBOs business model and it’s being executed with 700k subscribers and the first ever wagering platform of its kind! $FUBO is operating in $CMCSA, $ROKU, $NFLX, $DKNG territory. The growth opportunities are yuuuuuuge."
Company has a long term focus very rare in corporate America.
Thanks NBC for spreading the FJB chant to millions of people Keep it going!

selling at 11x eps 2018- 50% discount at $33
If the market as a whole doesn’t have a correction Comcast will be in the $70. Range by September of 2022 (13 months from now)
This will be a $50. stock this time next year. Collect the dividends and just be patient!
"SKY Glass looks interesting when Brian Roberts says he is all-in on NBCUniversal and SKY analysts don't believe it well from the new peacock president, a new partnership of Universal parks with Pokemon and now SKY Glass Comcast is really becoming agressive and looks like Brian Roberts doesn't want to give up that assets."
"This market is operating in a mode that makes zero sense. Comcast continues to be a strong performer, especially now as folks are confined to their homes with nothing to do other than browse the internet and watch television. I would expect that Comcast rallies in the coming months. A $35 price point on Comcast will not last indefinitely (it's trading at 2016 prices). I initiated a trade with 15,000 shares. Current horizon is 30-90 days. We'll see how it pans out."
"Fox to sell Sky stake to Comcast https://seekingalpha.com/news/3393110?source=ansh $FOX, $FOXA, $SKYAY, $CMCSA, $DIS"
Looking to buy
"The smart money knows that CMCSA is on sale at these prices. 2nd half 2021 the parks and studios will be going full blast, Olympics ad revenues, NBC and NBC sports will be raking in the ad dollars on top of all of this. And don't forget the ad revenues and subscription fees for Peacock. Also don't forget they still have a multibillion dollar payday coming from DIS in the future. That continues to grow in value as Hulu continues to grow."
"Oh boy, Comcast is such a juggernaut! What a vastly diversified company with their fingers in many o pies! How this isn't a $100 stock yet, I don't know? I like their direction and strategy as they move on to wireless - they got so much hard-wire in everywhere... such a head start on future wireless competition... all wireless systems eventually need a wire at some point, riiiight? Society keeps leaning on being entertained more and more each year... I'm glad to be long on this one for life! I think $45 is a real bargain and hoping the market realizes the solid value of Comcast this year in 2020 and Right-Fits the price to at least $65 by the end of the year."
Strong buy. Bullish indicators. https://cweb.com/2018/03/21/comcast-offers-31-billion-takeover-bid-for-european-pay-tv-giant-sky-cweb-com/
I heard about CMCSA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Yiannis: FUBO fuboTV is disrupting the streaming and sports wagering industry, so it's not directly comparable to anything! I'd say though $ROKU in streaming and $DKING in sports and it has $CMCSA and $DIS as investors"
Looking to buy this tomorrow at $30 or below.
Compare CMCSA to pure play network provider CHTR and CHTR is rewarded. Compare to pure play entertainment provider DIS and DIS is rewarded. CMCSA has world leading assets in each industry and it gets penalized for it. The day will come for CMCSA investors to win big. IMHO
Lets see what Comcast Does next. Fox is valued at $85 billion enterprise value.Good Luck to the highest bidder

Brian Robert CEO of Comcast should be removed form office. A report has emerged that NBC News has been praising China and its response to the Virus crisis because their parent Company Comcast has a deal to build a multi billion dollar theme park in China and Comcast executives do not want China criticized for fear China will cancel the deal. So much for truth at NBC News.Roberts must be fired.
basically pre announced
"Universal parks coming back online and a new theme park getting online in China next month so theme parks are getting great,SKY putting out some great content which they should capitalize it and put them on Peacock and on the subject of Peacock why not put the old classic cartoons,shows and movies there and stop with the licensing deals with Netflix, HBO MAX and all of that like Disney did and also start making originals they have a huge production machine and are not using it on their full potential and finishing this on the earnings we will start to see some strength"
"Buy the dip here... I think cmcsa earnings are on Oct 25th? Could be interesting- I'm betting its gonna be a good one, with bright forecasts. Smart $ will move on this prior to $48"
"The key to a successful sports betting platform is having an already established user base (approx. 700k streamers subscribed!) and 900k expected by year end. This user base can be parlayed into sports betting and even sports NFTs down the road if they company so chooses to explore this area. DraftKings $DKNG is doing sports NFTs currently and it's a massive success for them. FUBO is also backed by Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS, think this is huge? YES."
"splits, growth and dividends. Cant ask for mich more than that. Add the dips !"
Does anyone have any insight as to why the stock is rising today? possible reasons: 1) the stock is undervalued? 2) Info about the sky deal has leaked? 3) stock is just following the market? 4) something else?
New to CMCSA - just bought in - seems like a good discount.

What exactly is the rationale for CMCSA sitting here at 15 times forward earnings while other cable companies are at 20+ times forward earnings? We have quite a bit of upside in my opinion.
Wells Fargo is the epitome of a fraudulent company that scammed many of their customers and now this character is dispensing BS about Comcast. This character is like a carnival huckster!

"Definitely a great buy. Comcast is #1 Fiber optic / Ethernet provider in the country. Their coax broadband is always talked about, but residences aren’t cutting broadband they are cancelling cable TV. Comcast business, comcast home, NBC, universal pictures/ studios SKY in Europe, comcast resold wireless. Buy on the news."
i think we may have another acquisition incoming Viacomcbs is separating its Movie and TV units making two different companies if $CMCSA ever were to go after Viacomcbs they would have to spin off NBC it CBS looks like Viacom is making easier for Comcast make an offer for them.
CNBC Wilford Frost and Morgan make a good team. I watched them today. She is much improved and eye candy smart and bubbly. Those two are good together.

If Comcast gets ViacomCBS for anything under $85/share it will be a WIN/WIN for both companies and I would buy CMCSA.

Comcast’s acquisition of Masergy is spectacular for the enterprise business group. They have purchased the leader in SDWAN among those in the know.

"Interesting about Gabelli Funds talking Comcast being inflation safe and having a wide moat. If you think about it, broadband is all the rage and there is no bigger broadband provider than CMCSA. And I don't think inflation is rampant on the amount of bandwidth CMCSA has at its disposal to serve customers. The cost of a bit is not skyrocketing and that is what Comcast profits on."
"Comcast still charging double play customers $8.75 a month, $105 per year, for the sports fee.Even though the only sports being shown is marble racing, and reruns of football games from years ago.When will the sleepy FCC get off its rear end, and come in and protect us from being overcharged for a service we aren't even getting anymore. When will they come in and protect people who lost their jobs, and just want to be able to let their kids watch the Flintstones."
"In the beginning of the summer I predicted Comcast would reach $50. sometime in 2021. It came early. I know it will bounce around and maybe even go back to $47 or $48 but by the end of 2021 we'll be looking at $60. Invest in this thing if you want price, dividend growth and safety!"

Great earnings and less than a 1% pop. WTH?
seeing pictures of the new Universal theme park in China which according to CNN cost $7.7 billion to build which has its grand opening scheduled for September 20th which makes me wonder with Comcast investing in this new theme park and a new one coming to Orlando is Comcast really drop all that cash for then next year they get rid of NBCUniversal also excited for Skyshowtime here in certain parts of Europe next year
Very good day. The Olympics will add to earnings in July. Theme parks are opening to more paying guests. And Hulu gets more valuable with every passing month. Peacock continues to grow. Anything I am missing?
This is a forever stock. Look at the history. Grow grow grow split grow grow split. It split at 72 I believe a couple of years ago and slowly makes wealth. There are people who would go hungry before they cancel cancel their cable bill. Unbelievable cash flow. And don’t forget. One of if not the largest fiber / Ethernet / telecom companies in the USA

That's a 177 % increase.I'd like to see the FCC limit companies on rental fees. Like the fee should end when the price of the box has been paid.You can't get replacement boxes from outside companies for TV, like you can a modem for the internet. You have to use the high energy, hot to the touch Motorola box supplied by comcast. Remember when GM tried to force customers into buying special oil, and was told ""if you don't allow other manufacturers oils to honor warranty, you have to replace the oil for free ?"" If comcast can increase tv boxes with humongous increases, they should be forced to allow us to buy them from other sources. Happy holidays everyone."

"Complete overreaction, Insiders should Buy on this sell off. Solid Company for the Long Term. Very reasonable Valuation unlike other Junk!"
"@Ron, I choose to get all of my entertainment and communications from Comcast. I watch college football, pro football, NFL RedZone, Curse of Oak Island on History, CNBC, Bloomberg, C-SPAN, HBO, etc. Plus I get my 250 Mbps broadband which comes with security so I don't have to pay extra plus I have xFinity Mobile. It's only $13 per month compared to the previous $65 Vz bill. It's all paid by credit card, ez peezy lemon squeezy. That's why I own this stock because it is a great investment and when COVID is behind us, it will only go up from here."
what is going on ? Any news ? Are they buying something ?
"CMCSA's internet service is killing my business in this Covid-19 era. Everyone is working from home and I cannot get reliable enough upload speed on my home internet to support outgoing internet voice when I answer the phone. Callers say my voice is breaking up so they hear just bits and pieces. I hear them fine, so it is an upload vs. download issue. Then when we try to contact Xfinity to upgrade our speed, it is impossible to reach either a real person or find an online link that will upgrade the speed or get us the speed we are paying for, but not getting on the upload side. They have no email address on their bills, and their on-line chat-bot is hopeless, just pointing us to bundled plans that have all kinds of stuff we don't need. Already paying $143/month before taxes and fees and still only get 75mbps download and 3-4 mbps upload with variable reliability. And can't even get a speed upgrade w/o buying a whole new bundle. Also from their website it appears they will only let you upgrade, no downgrades. Here is hoping 5G gives them a whole bunch of competition!"
is there any news?
I remember people writing off the company and cable business years ago do not underestimate the management team they have proved to be great acquirers of companies and they have executed well in the past.
Buy under $52

"It may also have something to do with this, the CFO saying they aren't out shopping in the M&A market at a time when the meme among the money has been more scale needed in the media landscapehttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/comcast-acquisitions-high-bar-1235008137/"
"According to Yahoo CMCSA reports Jan 23. I can’t wait. Since ceasing the buy back, I think the balance sheet will look very good. Hopefully the Sky addition will be clear and bode well for at least a near term spike."
Any chance the CMCSA will expand their Interest with Sportsbook gambling?I know NBCUniversal made a deal with PointsBet earlier and Comcast previously reported that it owns a 9.3% stake of FuboTV.
Anyone else waiting to buy at $30
1 step forward 2 steps back. When will Comcast stop sitting on their hands?
A question: why do shareholders pay a 5% service charge + dividends to Equinti to reinvest their dividends in Comcast??? I'm incredulous...many other companies dividends are reinvested at no charge.
"IMHO, in August we will see some small correction. Anyone with me? No need to insult to disagree, just wondering how others feel about the market. GLTA! $MA $V $GOOGL $AMZN $CMCSA $JPM $SQ $VOO"
I would say we're good staying above 30.50 and out of the reach of the shorters
Tomorrow Before 8 pmCMCSA will be trading Over 67 dollars.
Good time to add at these levels. $37.40
Earnings Earnings Earnings that's all the Street is talking about now. CMCSA will probably over achieve again like always. Why isnt this stock over $100????
Comcast #205 on Forbes' America's Best Large Employers 2021 List.
so Hulu president just left the company and is reportedly in negotiations with NBCUniversal to be a senior executive probably overseeing Peacock with this move i think sometime soon enough we will see $DIS buy $CMCSA stake in HULU.
The market realizes that Comcast does more than just provide Cable TV right?
"For you bashers, are you sure you are right? Not only the theme park @Ruben mentions yesterday, CMCSA just announced record price for a 30 second Superbowl Ad spot of $6.5M and the Winter Olympics ads are nearly sold out. Both are in Feb 2022. There may be more upgrades in the near future."
In 12-14 months this stock will be in the $70. range. The nice part about it is that you get paid to wait with a decent dividend and you can sleep at night with this solid performer.
will amazon or aaple buy viac before comcast
