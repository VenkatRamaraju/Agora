Dave this is a forum for discussing Comcast not your political rants. Create your own page if you want to keep going over the edge.
When we go back to $42.00 ?
My bill 2 months ago for comcast internet was 79.95. They raised it to 82.70 last month and to 96.95 this month. I called and they dropped it back to 79.95 for a year if you agree to use it for a year. That should buy enough time for 5g internet to get rolled out and I can cut comcast out of my life for good. If they are jacking your rates monthly also call and save money. Give the worse company in America less money every month by a simple 10-15 minute call. Comcast can go #%$^ themselves!
with now this rumours of discussions of Brian Roberts and Shari redstone of combining their streaming service overseas do you think Brian will spun off NBCUniversal and merged it with $Viac $Viaca or will buy Viacomcbs
CMCSA will be Over 65 dollars This Wednesday.
Quiz time: How long do you think Comcast will stay with NBCUniversal before selling it or Spins Off i say by 2022 after the Warnermedia Discovery deal is done Comcast will make it's move
#ROKU mcap 60 bl with sales 2 bl. VIAC valuation at 27 bilion with revenues 26 bl... obvious is that $CMCSA will take for Viac
"Hi, I recently purchased Comcast shares as all the indications I read said it was significantly undervalued? Does the stock ever go up?"
"A few years ago I posted how bad Comcast was. I was even called a troll. Today my Comcast Home service and features are top notch. However Comcast Business are still run by bottom feeders. So here again is some constructive criticism. I never received a promised gift card for signing up for Comcast Business. Now I have canceled my Business account March 3, 2021 because the competition had a superiors service for less. Comcast Business is still billing me after months of faxing back my cancelation papers over and over again including my equipment return receipts. My only choice is to go to the county and make a complaint. I have e-mails and faxed documentation of returned equipment, canceled service and gift card issue. I hope Comcast turns their Business department around as well as they turned around their Home department. I'm feed up with their games. (not a Comcast stock holder)"
"Back over $40 finally. I thought we would get here sooner due to the SKY deal. But, we are here. Good luck longs. I think there is more to run my friends."
"Court date set for TVTV patent case against Comcast. So far, Comcast has lost every court filing. WhereverTV has a solid case against Comcast for infringement on their remote design. If Comcast doesn't settle the case then licensing fees could ding earnings for years."
Go buy Lionsgate and AMC Networks. Great content and A lot cheaper than Viacom.
"Everybody should relax, Disney is not going to allow Comcast to buy FOX."
Stock is setting a nice baseline and looking to bust into the 60’s after strong earnings.
what is up with the options on this thing?
Why don’t they sell NBC. The news is taking down the entire company. They mislead in the mists of a crisis for what? Democrats to take control. They aren’t for diversity. The newsroom is filled with 95 plus percent democrat donors. This is activism. I find it hard to stay with Comcast.
"Did you see that Peacock is going to produce a series called ""Joe Exotic?"" Can it catch lightning in a bottle? A big fan of the ""Tiger King,"" I have to say I am intrigued. Go Peacock!!!"
"Comcast is toast.Why it mattersWith its scale and network capacity, the New T-Mobile can disrupt one of the most un-competitive and un-customer-friendly industries in existence and save American consumers billions of dollars in the process.Who it’s forFor now, only a limited few T-Mobile customers – the goal is to reach 50,000 households this year, less than .04% of U.S. households. But the New T-Mobile plans to cover more than half of U.S. zip codes by 2024 with the capacity for 9.5 million households to cut the cord. Bellevue, Washington — March 21, 2019 — The Un-carrier is prepping to disrupt one of the most uncompetitive industries in existence. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) began piloting home Internet service, sending invites to a limited group of T-Mobile customers in rural and underserved markets for high-speed fixed wireless service. It’s all part of the Un-carrier’s effort to give Americans real choice and competition for home broadband – and save consumers billions – with the New T-Mobile.The T-Mobile Home Internet pilot is offered exclusively in areas we expect to deliver speeds of around 50 Mbps through fixed unlimited wireless service over LTE – with no data caps. It’s just $50 per month with AutoPay, and because it’s from T-Mobile, there are no annual service contracts, no hidden fees and no equipment costs. Setting up the in-home router is simple, and pilot customers get support from a dedicated team of real people – from the company that consistently ranks #1 in customer service satisfaction year after year.Due to LTE network and spectrum capacity constraints, the T-Mobile Home Internet pilot is limited by invitation-only to existing customers in specific areas, with the goal of reaching 50,000 households by the end of the year – or slightly less than 0.04% of U.S. households. But if T-Mobile’s pending merger with Sprint is approved, with the added scale and capacity of the New T-Mobile, the Un-carrier plans to cover more than half of U.S. households with 5G broadband service – in excess of 100 Mbps – by 2024. And Americans stand to save billions. Today, consumers typically pay around $80 per month for wired in-home broadband service – $960 per year. Thanks to lower prices and more competition, one economist estimates that the New T-Mobile will save customers up to $13.65 billion a year on home broadband by 2024!“Two weeks ago, I laid out our plans for home broadband with the New T-Mobile. Now, we’re already hard at work building toward that future,” said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile. “We’re walking the walk and laying the foundation for a world where we can take the fight to Big Cable on behalf of consumers and offer real choice, competition and savings to Americans nationwide.”Almost half of American households have no competitive choice for high-speed in-home broadband with speeds of 100 Mbps, and in rural areas, more than three quarters have no high-speed broadband service or only one option available. And when there’s no choice, customers suffer. It’s no wonder internet service providers and cable and satellite TV companies have the lowest customer satisfaction ratings out of 46 industries according to ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index)! The New T-Mobile will be armed with spectrum and network assets that will build the highest capacity wireless network in U.S. history, covering millions with 5G, not just a few people in a few blocks of a few cities like the other guys. The New T-Mobile will have the capability to cover more than half of U.S. zip codes with un-wired and un-cabled in-home broadband by 2024 and will be able to support 9.5 million American households for its high-speed in-home broadband service.Current T-Mobile customers in select areas eligible to participate in the pilot will receive T-Mobile Home Internet invitations this week by email and U.S. mail with information on how to sign up."
"Over eleven billion,close to twelve last year , plus I like the people at Comcast and universal"

"Beats on EPS, beats on revenue and strength in broadband market, it’s only negative was the loss bigger than anticipated on cable subscribers, this is oversold and it’s only a matter of time before it recoups to new highs"
Another down day on Friday at least Market closed Saturday and Sunday.
"Have you seen the weather channel recently. Every day they say , No its not wild fires, its climate change fires.They neglect to talk about having too many people, drilling too many wells, taking too much moisture out, and forcing too much rain water into creeks and rivers, and not funding needed forest fire prevention and harvesting, that would drastically cut down on the number and size of fires.The channel sends dozens of people to hurricanes. Recently Mike Seidel warned us that the fallen leaves of a hurricane can make a road slippery. One time he showed us a snow hill from plows on a parking lot. Cantore was on top of it, with exciting video of a casino parking lot, after the water drained out. And today, Abrams informed us that if you receive direct sunlight, you warm up, and so does the temperature. wow. I never knew that. you guys are soooo smart. If the channel really cared about the environment, they'd stop sending people to storms, and use local coverage. if they really cared. Now you might say they take commercial flights. So. Their added weight uses more jet fuel. Don't go, or take a train, like AOC wants to do. Stop the climate mongering. me, and millions others stopped watching the NFL, and NBA, with their mongering, and it wont take much to turn you out. You stop warming the planet, then maybe you are qualified to make your point of view. And comcast has the tv modems that are hot to the touch. if comcast cared, they'd order modems that don't waste electricity. You've got a lot of nerve comcast. but if you can bait people into packages, then take away the 2 best channels, and then take away internet security, during high unemployment and a pandemic, then perhaps you'd sell out your mom too, if it pushed profits up, to make rich people even richer. ."
"Comcast still charging double play customers $8.75 a month, $105 per year, for the sports fee.Even though the only sports being shown is marble racing, and reruns of football games from years ago.When will the sleepy FCC get off its rear end, and come in and protect us from being overcharged for a service we aren't even getting anymore. When will they come in and protect people who lost their jobs, and just want to be able to let their kids watch the Flintstones."
Strong buy. Bullish indicators. https://cweb.com/2018/03/21/comcast-offers-31-billion-takeover-bid-for-european-pay-tv-giant-sky-cweb-com/
"Remember, short term investors are bringing this stock down. If you are a long term investor, you have to buy now so you can take the discount that the short sellers are giving you. The more we gobble up means more money. It means less shares for the shorts. This is absolutely normal. This same exact thing (go check for yourself) happened when Comcast bought NBC Universal"
Mike I know great day. 2inch New York Steak going on the barbecue tonight.
"Makes me wonder if Comcast increased their bid just so Disney would have to come in a way overpay for Fox.You'd be crazy to buy DIS until everything shakes out, CMCSA can now restart buying back stock and finding better deals than Fox.Big boys play rough..."
What’s going on with this stock?
Very good day. The Olympics will add to earnings in July. Theme parks are opening to more paying guests. And Hulu gets more valuable with every passing month. Peacock continues to grow. Anything I am missing?
This is confirmation friends. Up we go.

Maybe Comcast $CMCSA can talk to TBS and TNT about joining up with FUBO
Dividend shares coming in tomorrow!
$CMCSA better shutdown peacock if they are going to still to continue produce for other streaming services instead of their own that 4 month window is asking for people to cancel their peacock subscription if you don't want to invest in streaming then shutdown peacock or spin off NBCUniversal like $T did with Warnermedia and let other company run the show
Earnings predictions? I want to buy some calls
"C'mon, let the big dog eat!! Way to go Comcast!! Quite a fantastic beat this quarter!! Their share price deserves to be up near a $100 - what a great essential juggernaut of a company they've become and will continue to be!!!"
what happened this afternoon ? Down $ 2.00
I believe ComCast is about to rise with NFL season starting new shows on NBC. alot of these getting turned around with corporate.
Buy and hold
CMCSA will be back over $40 in no time. Their business impact is minimal and limited. Their subscriber base will grow due to people staying home. People that are unemployed need to know what’s in the news and also get online to search for jobs
"CMCSA should be in the $40 plus,Why is the low ?"
We don’t support fake news!!
Do your homework study Harmonic HLIT you will find Comcast is doing exactly that and is incorporating its technology in moving TV broadcasting to the cloud. Follow Comcast's lead they did the homework and are buying the solution and also investing in the company

Feels great. Reduced my monthly bill from $165 to $55 and got a higher internet speed- fiber optic cable from AT &T. Fromm 200 megabytes to 300 megabytes. Comcast is a ripoff. Will spend $30 with Sling for a total monthly bill $85-$90.What is preventing people from leaving Comcast?
If Comcast gets ViacomCBS for anything under $85/share it will be a WIN/WIN for both companies and I would buy CMCSA.
Staying long here!
"Americans spent 44% more time streaming video in 2020Q4. The streaming wars among $NFLX, $AMZN, $CMCSA, $DISCA, $VIAC, $T and $DIS really begin now post COVID. $DIS + growth is slowing down, but content is what it matters. $DIS will survive strong."
$4.50-$5.00 FY 2021 = P/E <10Plus the 2.10% dividend and potential for a $AAPL $AMZN $CMCSA buyout...
Does anyone have any insight as to why the stock is rising today? possible reasons: 1) the stock is undervalued? 2) Info about the sky deal has leaked? 3) stock is just following the market? 4) something else?
"@Ron, I choose to get all of my entertainment and communications from Comcast. I watch college football, pro football, NFL RedZone, Curse of Oak Island on History, CNBC, Bloomberg, C-SPAN, HBO, etc. Plus I get my 250 Mbps broadband which comes with security so I don't have to pay extra plus I have xFinity Mobile. It's only $13 per month compared to the previous $65 Vz bill. It's all paid by credit card, ez peezy lemon squeezy. That's why I own this stock because it is a great investment and when COVID is behind us, it will only go up from here."
"Cutting over to Comcast Business cell phones! Saaahhhweeeet!! Can imagine, that'll be happening lots - nice move Comcast!"
finally $CMCSA is starting to invest in Peacock they should've done this since the start
Looking to buy
"Well boys I put in a buy order, if it executes at the price by Friday ill be a member of the Comcast club"
Can someone explain that this company’s earnings are higher than Netflix but share price is low? Is it good entry point ? Do u recommend it ?
"Peacock buys the American broadcast rights to the WWE today, including offering PPV for free (included) to all Peacock subscribers. WWE has a huge fan base. This is big. The Punky Brewster sequel will help too."
Why we up?
Jan '19 Calls strike 35 looking tempting...
"So, a competitor of CMCSA doesn't like history, to be taught. They like to call it critical race theory. They don't like to let people know about recent historical discoveries in Canada: over 750 bodies found in a mass grave at an ""Indian boarding school"", AKA forced reeducation. The same has happened elsewhere in Canada with an estimate of more than 3000 dead/buried in mass graves/unaccounted for/First Nations Children. The same has been happening here in the US. Many other issues on history another big network wants to keep unknown to their viewers, think of what General Miley recently said."
Ouch! And we were doing so well too...almost at 40...now this reversal...

The funniest part of this story is $CMCSA thinks they can actually create a product that can compete with $ROKU
Getting upgrades and good articles to buy NOW - still laagering around... maybe tomorrow folks will believe the higher value that Comcast should really be at to at least look like their in the same category of enterprise? :D C'mon - I think in 2 weeks folks would have wished they got in at $60!
"This is at least 50% undervalued at this level. I can't say if the mood of investors will return fast or slow, nevertheless I imagine as unlikely that this will not touch 45 by end 2019."
"Should buy AMC Networks. Perfect add on. More channels and more importantly, more content for Peacock. AMCX is cheap with great cash flow. Then they should buy Lionsgate. Another cheap one with good content."
Harrison Ford is to old to paly Indiana Jones. Liam Hemsworth should play the lead!
"Today, the Trump administration has issued an internet lockup, when reporters are given information about economic releases.

"Been holding this stock for 5 years even got a 2:1 split my average share price is $31 all while paying me a dividend. However , if this hits $58-$60 this year I will sell 3/4 of my shares most likely. Great companyAnd They’re more than just cable tv provider which a lot of people think."
"Wow getting eviscerated on social media for their data cap plans..""Price gouging in an emergency and monopoly"""
"This stock is like an elevator up huge one day and then down huge the next day. There is no positive or negative news for either swing. I guess the play is to day trade it, holding long term is just like treading water. Great earnings report and the stock got crushed the very next day."
"Barrons : May 2 2018 comments on CMCSAComcast saw a double-digit collapse in the first quarter, falling 14%. Barron's has said that the company is undervalued. We think the shares are ""too cheap given the strength of the company's core U.S. business."" An analyst we spoke with saw Comcast going to $55 -- up 72% from Tuesday's closing price of $32.06. Los Angeles Capital was also bullish, buying 1.7 million more Comcast shares, ending the first quarter with 2.8 million shares. Netflix shares were a hit in the first quarter, rocketing 54%. Los Angeles Capital dialed up its investment in the streaming service by 46,800 shares, ending March with 216,000 shares. We noted last week that with Netflix stock up tenfold in five years, it could soon surpass the market value of Walt Disney (DIS)."
They should buy Lions Gate and Discover networks!
"I'm going to make a case about Comcast not needing to spin off NBCUniversal right now with Restrictions being lifted around the world Comcast another business Theme Parks a real competitor to Disney will start to see their numbers up and people after being stuck in the house for a full year Streaming movies or so will probably be one of the last things they will think about in terms of going back to normal, Universal Orlando yesterday opened a new ride the line to get into that ride went well beyond the restaurants outside of the main Park into the Citywalk and besides Comcast was able to do what AT&T couldn't which was agressivly grow a business make them a real juggernaut in Media.What do you think of my analysis?"
Time for a surprise rise to $56 tomorrow! Let's go!
Why is no one talking about earnings tomorrow morning?
Earnings Earnings Earnings that's all the Street is talking about now. CMCSA will probably over achieve again like always. Why isnt this stock over $100????
Good time to add at these levels. $37.40
selling at 11x eps 2018- 50% discount at $33
"Wow SEC Network, Big Ten, PAC 12 all in the Elite plan with all the classic non-sports stations can you say college football? This is an unreal deal through $FUBO this isn’t something $NFLX offers. Comcast offers it at a much much higher price $CMCSA"
"Of course, I'm no genius when it comes to analytics, doing DD on fundamentals or understanding all the financial numbers, but I do read a lot and look at many professional's ratings. What I've read is that there's many money managers out there that have a Buy rating, very few have hold and a miniscule of them with a sell rating. That's a lotta money brains going in one direction. They think Comcast stock price is well worth $50, one reported $64. Some are downright giddy about Comcast, like it's a hidden gem, others a bit more conservative. I know most companies can't please everyone, however I think most try to do their best. Either way, regardless of a natural amount of negative experiences with them, this investment looks like there's a lot of positive fundamentals, words and excitement happening right now and for years to come! I could eat some crow on this later, but this doesn't feel like some pump 'n dump - these guys are just too big for that and they'll be around for quite some time. For me, I'm gonna go with the flow on this one! "
Nice upgrade today!  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/comcast-stock-heads-higher-after-upgrade-2020-02-04
that was the most action this thing has seen in a while.
"Feels like Comcast's price action could and should just jump on up... I think if it leaped to $75, it'd stick and continue trending up over the next few years to a $100 and beyond"
If the market as a whole doesn’t have a correction Comcast will be in the $70. Range by September of 2022 (13 months from now)
Wowowowow red hot valuations. CMCSA will only dip further as the numbers reveal it will need to overpay to outbid DIS. Buying at $28
"What a nice Christmas gift from comcast. The monthly rental on TV boxes is going up from 2.50 to 4.60. An 84% increase.The monthly charge for the remote is going from 18 cents to 40 cents. That's a 177 % increase.I'd like to see the FCC limit companies on rental fees. Like the fee should end when the price of the box has been paid.You can't get replacement boxes from outside companies for TV, like you can a modem for the internet. You have to use the high energy, hot to the touch Motorola box supplied by comcast. Remember when GM tried to force customers into buying special oil, and was told ""if you don't allow other manufacturers oils to honor warranty, you have to replace the oil for free ?"" If comcast can increase tv boxes with humongous increases, they should be forced to allow us to buy them from other sources. Happy holidays everyone."
"Americans spent 4% more time streaming video in 2020Q4. The streaming wars among $NFLX, $AMZN, $CMCSA, $DISCA, $VIAC, $T and $DIS really begin now post COVID. $DIS +"
"Peacocks value is WAY WAY WAY WAY under realized. Theyre going to be the big player in the cable to streaming transition along with Disney (ABC/ESPN/Hulu/Disney+). They already have snagged NHL rights, Premier League Rights (they own SKY Sports as well), WWE and have a deep internal catalogue with The Office, 30 Rock, Brooklyn 99 etc..."
CNBC TV is not broadcasting live in Canada since July 26th on cable provider Shaw!What is going on? I'm paying for this TV service!
What exactly is the rationale for CMCSA sitting here at 15 times forward earnings while other cable companies are at 20+ times forward earnings? We have quite a bit of upside in my opinion.
Don’t know what I would do without (http://financialdeals.tech). Their daily emails give me all the info I need to make the most of my trades!
I remember people writing off the company and cable business years ago do not underestimate the management team they have proved to be great acquirers of companies and they have executed well in the past.
Fox and Disney will never allow Comcast to buy Fox and Sky
I believe divvy capture date is today my friends.
So happy to have bought this stock even though I hate Comcast.
Brian Robert CEO of Comcast should be removed form office. A report has emerged that NBC News has been praising China and its response to the Virus crisis because their parent Company Comcast has a deal to build a multi billion dollar theme park in China and Comcast executives do not want China criticized for fear China will cancel the deal. So much for truth at NBC News.Roberts must be fired.
I wokr for Comcast and we just released Xfinity FLEX today! Huge competition to the other streaming devices and platforms $5 a month cancel any time. Thats something to be kind of excited about.
"good earnings up 1.92 yesterday, so it drops 3.5% today? I don't get it"
Adding Sky will propel Comcast's annual revenue to the $100 billion club in a year or two.
now with the M&A frenzy going on do you think Brian Roberts will stay true to his words and not pursue anything or will he spin off NBCUniversal or buy something else after the deal of Warnermedia with Discovery is closed?
Tomorrow Before 8 pmCMCSA will be trading Over 67 dollars.
Comcast has lost $48 billion from its high way more than $31 billion proposed Bid for sky.
"Time for Comcast to catch up to being over valued like all the rest!! C'mon Institutions, lots of head room going up here... this is a great place to park your client's big bucks!! Let's go already!!"
"Oh boy, Comcast is such a juggernaut! What a vastly diversified company with their fingers in many o pies! How this isn't a $100 stock yet, I don't know? I like their direction and strategy as they move on to wireless - they got so much hard-wire in everywhere... such a head start on future wireless competition... all wireless systems eventually need a wire at some point, riiiight? Society keeps leaning on being entertained more and more each year... I'm glad to be long on this one for life! I think $45 is a real bargain and hoping the market realizes the solid value of Comcast this year in 2020 and Right-Fits the price to at least $65 by the end of the year."
"IMHO, in August we will see some small correction. Anyone with me? No need to insult to disagree, just wondering how others feel about the market. GLTA! $MA $V $GOOGL $AMZN $CMCSA $JPM $SQ $VOO"
"This stock is extremely sensitive to RSI signals and has finally entered oversold territory. The on balance volume has not declined enough to justify the extreme price decline, meaning longs are holding onto their positions. Lots of volume occurring on Friday and yesterday, likely value investors starting to come in. With the large amount of shares short, these declines are the work of aggressive short sellers. When this bottoms out soon it can only mean 1 thing........ a massive short squeeze is coming"
CMCSA is breaking out. Sum of the parts way undervalued!
"NBC and the Olympics are compellingly proving the dictum, ""Get woke, go broke.""https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbc-boss-insists-tokyo-olympics-profitable?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_conversation&spot_im_redirect_source=notifications&spot_im_comment_id=sp_ANQXRpqH_urn%243Auri%243Abase64%243A538ad5bd-853e-5c3d-ba53-7f8e0e9cd375_c_1w1dIDB1mfS2D8EVhnQxAmFNmct&spot_im_highlight_immediate=true"
who bought at the top 44?
Honestly... I’m excited for their next earnings report. I think with the rise of peacock and theme parks opening back up.. I’m very bullish on this stock! $65 plus seems more accurate based on the outlook for the year.
Really considering taking a strong position with CMCSA.
go msnbc and cnbc!!! dems taking markets to new highs almost daily. the money printing machine is lifingall boats and the weaker dollar really helping the price of oil!! chevron and exxon have doubled and the divis still greater than 5 percent with chevron increasing theirs 5 cents and estimates of exxons are increasing !!i am retiring on my cap gains and div!!! GO JOE AND KAMErA
"Today got an upgrade from Raymond James saying it expects a strong first-quarter earnings,"
"The smart money knows that CMCSA is on sale at these prices. 2nd half 2021 the parks and studios will be going full blast, Olympics ad revenues, NBC and NBC sports will be raking in the ad dollars on top of all of this. And don't forget the ad revenues and subscription fees for Peacock. Also don't forget they still have a multibillion dollar payday coming from DIS in the future. That continues to grow in value as Hulu continues to grow."
"Zoinks! I got a bit rocked today! Hope it doesn't trend down from here. I'm long, but I do enjoy seeing the short term rises. Could rebound by mid next week or even tomorrow?"
"CMCSA continues to power to new highs. No resistance above and we have the upcoming revenues from the Olympics, parks increasing, theaters reopening and don't forget the Hulu stake."
"Wow. Great earning and fizzle out, very familiar in today's wacked market."
No one is watching the woke Olympics. NBC losing millions
$40 before the end of the year
FierceTelecom reported that Comcast received 2 more DoD contracts worth $155M.
cable stocks are defensive in a shaky market and Comcast is a cheap stock in a expensive market
New to CMCSA - just bought in - seems like a good discount.
Any chance the CMCSA will expand their Interest with Sportsbook gambling?I know NBCUniversal made a deal with PointsBet earlier and Comcast previously reported that it owns a 9.3% stake of FuboTV.
$FUBO can grab customers from $CMCSA Comcast subscribers and from sports bettors at DraftKings $DKNG and also from $ROKU who are looking for a fuller solution.
I currently have a 23 percent gain on this stock and added to my position after the latest earnings report. It is well liked by analysts and the street alike. I predict good things for the stock ahead.
wish the political statements on the board will stop if you listen to people who have no bias on either party you will realize that the media on both sides have their own agenda - the middle class is being destroyed before your eyes
"Just out of curiosity yesterday, I watched Mad Money on CNBC. And of course I realized nothing much has changed in the 6 years since I stopped. Cramer is there quoting Gartman on oil. Saying Gartman says if oil breaks this lower level, it could keep going down. And if it breaks this upper level, it could keep going up. I have to tell you, that is sound advice. The price of oil could go down, or it could go up."
The sum of the parts much greater than the whole.Way under valued.Should NBC be a stand alone company?
"CNBC is, increasingly out of control. Everyday, the number of hosts and reporters that are ""editorialists"" increases. The hatred for the Presicent is over the top. They clearly seek out guests who agree with their mindset to aid in their editiroailizing. It has gone from a premier business reporting enterprise in the 1990's to a leftist group that seems to in theory hate the engine of our capitalist country. If they succeed in their goal to change things up I guess they dont realize they will be the fitst ones in the gulags."
"3:10 to Yuma leaving the station. Think of friends and family that can switch to FuboTV “Elite” package on their smart tvs and still have sports and Fox News, etc. even Big Ten Network etc. no wonder $CMCSA owns part of FUBO"
"I have just started nibbling this stock on dips based on a Barrons article last weekend... Of note,“Comcast is undervalued by almost $100 billion,” says Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group in New York. That $100 billion estimate—based on his sum-of-the-parts analysis—translates into more than $20 a share. He has a Buy rating on the stock and a $55 price target, one of the highest on Wall Street. (The shares closed on Thursday at $34.17.)I nibbled at 34.11, was regretting it almost instantly and then nibbled today at 32.95... Are most the people here bulls? it appears that way. I also watch Century Link and own quite a bit of that due to its current valuation... In the midst of difficulty finding value in today's markets I see these two companies quite interesting.....thoughts?"
"They are looking to finance the acquisition of Fox with all cash, they must be pretty undervalued if they are not including some sort of stock component for a fee of 62 billion. It would make it the largest cash acquisition ever"
"Mike, still here brother good day."
"I have 1,100 shares, ASP $32.06, so take this as from someone who has some skin in the game but not a ton. I am happy to leave my money here and keep collecting on dividends and growth for years to come. I see an innovative company with a broad reach of interests and think we are really undervalued here. I’ve started adding on a timed basis and will continue to do so."
EPS $3.61 next year at 12x eps. Should be at 17 market multiple and $61.37 a share
Gonna be $60 by next summer
CMCSA reached a new 52 Week Low at 30.86
comcast doing really well... nice to see it hitting a 52 week high. maybe disneys mis step with its fast passdebacle will help? saw the nbc pool. cant believe they found 500 people who dont have a clue what is going on.
"Why in the world would comcast buy Fox ? So they can ruin it, like they did NBC and CNBC, and the Flyers ?If comcast buys Fox, and Fox has to march to the liberal agenda, there are fewer and fewer reasons to keep paying for my cable bill."
Is broadband in the infrastructure bill thz
"Fox to sell Sky stake to Comcast https://seekingalpha.com/news/3393110?source=ansh $FOX, $FOXA, $SKYAY, $CMCSA, $DIS"
I'm going to switch from $CMCSA Comcast cable to $FUBO on my smart 4k TV
Does anybody know if CMCSA has a plan for when cord is cut??
CMCSA reached a new All Time High at 43.35
"According to Yahoo CMCSA reports Jan 23. I can’t wait. Since ceasing the buy back, I think the balance sheet will look very good. Hopefully the Sky addition will be clear and bode well for at least a near term spike."
I guess no one noticed that aftermarket pop?
"Not what I expected but I would think tomorrow Comcast should rebound, regardless this is a good long term investment"
"Not only am I NOT watching the NFL, but when there is an eagles game on, I take a knee, and turn the TV off.other than federal and state tax subsidies, the nfl will not profit off me, because of Jenkins."
Love this stock!!!
This will be a $50. stock this time next year. Collect the dividends and just be patient!
Comcast Enterprise value is at $215 billion. $86 billion in revenue. $66 billion in Debt. $6 billion in cash. Comcast should go higher on their bid.Disney Enterprise value is at $176 billion. $56 billion in revenue and 4 billion in cash. may the best bidder win
Comcast #205 on Forbes' America's Best Large Employers 2021 List.
Upgrade was announced on CNBC raising PT from $65 to $70.
Anyone else waiting to buy at $30
wow comcast offer buy out Frontier Communications Corporation.
"Could someone explain why this thing will not go up? Makes money goes down. Beats estimates, goes down. The same bad news is the cable stuff but that’s been in the light of day for years. It’s not shocking."
Comcast dropping free Norton 360 included in your cable subscription. That is a stealth $105/year cost increase that you will have to pay to Norton now.
"PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2018-- Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA), a leading cable, entertainment and communications company, announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 a share on the company’s common stock. The quarterly dividend is payable on January 23, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 2, 2019."
Nelson Peltz needs to break up this company to unlock value for shareholders. Charter has outperformed compared to Comcast for years now.
"Down today due to the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger....IMO this is a buying opportunity. Unlike Discovery, which used to trade at a reasonable valuation but now has ceased to be cheap, CMCSA remains fundamentally cheap when it comes to free cash flow yield and other valuation metrics. It doesn't rise quickly but I honestly think a $30 move to the upside is in the cards when looking 5 years into the future."
In 12-14 months this stock will be in the $70. range. The nice part about it is that you get paid to wait with a decent dividend and you can sleep at night with this solid performer.

"Comcast chief Brian Roberts is exploring the future of the company’s place in streaming, raising the idea of a possible tie-up with ViacomCBS or acquisition of Roku, according to a Wednesday report from The Wall Street Journal."
Already pay through the nose with Comcast and they want to charge another 5 bucks to get me to watch peacock. LOL
Markets starting to make sense now. No way a company like Netflix should have a larger market cap than Comcast or Disney.
Movin' on UP! Into earnings. That deluxe apartment in the sky.
"interesting phrase from Jeff Shell ""might see acquisitions that will help grow internationally"" what else could they buy?"
If you want to comment about FUBO then click onto their conversation post and do it there. This is for conversations about Comcast.
"This company provides the worst services, outage 2 days already in my area, could not reach customer services at all in anyway. switching to FiOS."
Can Comcast buy Fox’s regional sports that Disney needs to divest?
"Maybe not huge considering the scope of Comcast, but they have a deal that was pretty much completed today that will positively impact their bottom line by about 7Billion. Hopefully sp will move nicely next week. Even a slight move of the needle is good."
Mario Gabelli says comcast is way undervalued.
Why CMCSA rally today ? Any details?
wow that is so good...
CMCSA is one of the most underrated stocks out there
5G will be the end for cable. Buy ATT now while you can still afford it and get a 6% dividend to boot!
CMCSA going back up $33 ??
"The Simpson already predicted Comcast to be one of the largest conglomerates, at this point I trust the Simpson’s more than the news"
nice company - solid stock
"inching towards a recent high of 45.94, and if it crosses that threshold it will be in a window between that, and its all time high of 48.84... could get interesting."

"CMCSA's internet service is killing my business in this Covid-19 era. Everyone is working from home and I cannot get reliable enough upload speed on my home internet to support outgoing internet voice when I answer the phone. Callers say my voice is breaking up so they hear just bits and pieces. I hear them fine, so it is an upload vs. download issue. Then when we try to contact Xfinity to upgrade our speed, it is impossible to reach either a real person or find an online link that will upgrade the speed or get us the speed we are paying for, but not getting on the upload side. They have no email address on their bills, and their on-line chat-bot is hopeless, just pointing us to bundled plans that have all kinds of stuff we don't need. Already paying $143/month before taxes and fees and still only get 75mbps download and 3-4 mbps upload with variable reliability. And can't even get a speed upgrade w/o buying a whole new bundle. Also from their website it appears they will only let you upgrade, no downgrades. Here is hoping 5G gives them a whole bunch of competition!"
Wish I didnt sell my CMCSA. Just heard Amazon is interested in buying Comcast and selling off the park assets.
So is this going up or down next week? When Comcast was actively trying to pursue Fox assets that sank the stock to the low 30s. Will the Sky bid push us closer to 40 or back down to mid 30s?
"How many of you can recall years ago when Comcast was THE MOST HATED company in America?When we moved and had to go to an Xfinity store to get our modem and TV box, I told my wife, NO WAY am I doing that! I walked out saying how impressed I was with the efficiency and customer service. Unbelievable and now I own a few thousand shares of this company."
win or lose this stock is cheap.
The stock price is great if you reinvest divvies. Wait until the Sky deal starts adding to revenue numbers. I’m holding.
I keep telling you we don't need you to watch NBC republicans! We don't need you to own this stock either!
"Why would you invest in a malevolent company that manipulates you via cnbc and raises the price on your internet access during covid. Their profits are short sighted and won’t last, as everything else in this economy even those are at a premium right now. To be a fair value stock it has to drop 30%."
Comcast’s acquisition of Masergy is spectacular for the enterprise business group. They have purchased the leader in SDWAN among those in the know. Masergy is the best from a technology and customer experience point. Probably less that 1/2 billion in revenue but they bring expertise and LARGE customers. Good job Comcast!
Comcast is by far my best performer since last two months
Mark this post. CMCSA does a 2 for 1 split in 2022.
"Hey Mike we will be ok today, buying XOM today 7percent dividend"
The mgt. team has a fantastic track record with acquisitions and the company continues to innovate.
"OOOooo boyieee, I'll be able to live stream Jimmy Fallen 3 hours earlier than watching on TV. What a game changer !!! LOL"
Company has a long term focus very rare in corporate America.
Reiteration of what was printed on The Wall Street Journal: updated 1/23/2020https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-earnings-rise-26-lifted-by-broadband-growth-11579780848
"The months preceding.....The 3rd and 4th Quarters following the Olympics are always the best time to buy Comcast. Q3 and Q4 following the Olympics are the best quarters ever for Comcast/NBCU...plus 2021 Gives us not only the Olympics, but also SURGING theme park attendance for the next 12 months."
I'm opening a class action lawsuit against comcast. Their tech support makes customers incur unnecessary expense to prove their routers are defective. I've had 3 instances in the past month and $2800 of unpaid bills that are comcast induced troubleshooting. If anyone else out there has instances of this please reply.
I see $35 coming
"The key to a successful sports betting platform is having an already established user base (approx. 700k streamers subscribed!) and 900k expected by year end. This user base can be parlayed into sports betting and even sports NFTs down the road if they company so chooses to explore this area. DraftKings $DKNG is doing sports NFTs currently and it's a massive success for them. FUBO is also backed by Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS, think this is huge? YES."
"This market is operating in a mode that makes zero sense. Comcast continues to be a strong performer, especially now as folks are confined to their homes with nothing to do other than browse the internet and watch television. I would expect that Comcast rallies in the coming months. A $35 price point on Comcast will not last indefinitely (it's trading at 2016 prices). I initiated a trade with 15,000 shares. Current horizon is 30-90 days. We'll see how it pans out."
"To be honest, CMCSA is undervalued .Great buy ! Should trend up pretty soon."
Best quarter for Comcast coming up
why did it jump to 60
Disney $DIS and Comcast $CMCSA are shareholders in $FUBO. That’s as heavy as it gets. $NFLX doesn’t even have this solution as it’s an add on not an over the top! It doesn’t fully solve the problem of cable while $FUBO does. That’s is why Comcast is hedging their “bets”.
"Many ""streamers"" are up today: $AMC, $VIAC, $DISCA, $LGF-A, $CHTR, $NFLX, $CMCSA and don't forget good ol' $ROKU"
A question: why do shareholders pay a 5% service charge + dividends to Equinti to reinvest their dividends in Comcast??? I'm incredulous...many other companies dividends are reinvested at no charge.
I would say we're good staying above 30.50 and out of the reach of the shorters
The market realizes that Comcast does more than just provide Cable TV right?
All my stocks were green now one buy one turning red not surprised.
It looks like sellers gave everyone an opportunity to buy shares yesterday.
"Look at the price your cable ISP is charging you and then look at the price and speed of Verizon Home 5G. Will $CMCSA keep their $180 billion dollar market cap when another company is offering more speed at half the price? I'm not sure if $VZ will be the winners of the 5G war, but it will be good to at least have competition in the high speed internet arena again."
CMCSA will change kill the movie theatres and the move to go live with new releases is risky but right for current stay at home economy. Long term CMCSA will own this space once 5G comes to fruition
Yesterday was a breakout. We need confirmation with a higher close in the next 3 days.
"I'm still supportive of $CMCSA spinning off NBCUniversal since they don't from the looks of it want to build Peacock and are still licensing to other services what's the point of announcing a new service, launch and then let it run dry while others are building their services with their own and NBCUniversal stuff in there as well just spin off NBCUniversal already"
Joy Reid practices systemic racism against whites on a daily basis. Comcast owns MSNBC and has allowed this type of racism to go on for years. Should the shareholders of MSNBC be concerned?
"Motley Fool frames it well, over the past 5 years broadband customers increased by over 7 million, customers decreased less than 4 million. A fantastically profitable formula for great stock price growth for the foreseeable future."
"Universal parks coming back online and a new theme park getting online in China next month so theme parks are getting great,SKY putting out some great content which they should capitalize it and put them on Peacock and on the subject of Peacock why not put the old classic cartoons,shows and movies there and stop with the licensing deals with Netflix, HBO MAX and all of that like Disney did and also start making originals they have a huge production machine and are not using it on their full potential and finishing this on the earnings we will start to see some strength"
"Comcast is truly one of the best stocks I’ve owned in the last 10 yrs. Growth, nice dividend and it held up very well during the pandemic. Also, last but not least......I’ve been able to sleep nights owning it."
Sweet Beat!
finna hit 300 in an hour just a warning for last minute train passengers.
Reiterate: This stock will be at or near $70. by next summer providing the the whole market does not correct. Great investment and you can sleep at night owning it.
CNBC Wilford Frost and Morgan make a good team. I watched them today. She is much improved and eye candy smart and bubbly. Those two are good together.
The first thing that Xiden asked about when he heard about the suicide bomber is that was he wearing a mask and was he vaccinated. Running the country from the mental hospital
Looking to buy this tomorrow at $30 or below.
We just took a position in CMCSA with a $48 target in mind for Yr 2020. Sold MET to buy Comcast. Just got my bill after the first year it went up $30 a month with no way to lower it with out lowering my Internet speed. It was a no brainer. If they want $30 more a month I will take it in dividends and equity appreciation.
$CMCSA Target Raised by Truist Securities Buy USD 65 » USD 70 Target Raised by Credit Suisse Outperform USD 67 » USD 70 Target Raised by Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 70 » USD 72 Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Buy USD 65 » USD 68 Target Raised by Pivotal Research Buy USD 70 » USD 72
"Comcast has a lot of value left to be unlocked. This all backed up by valuation metrics such as EV/EBITDA, PEG ratio, and free cash flow yield. The PEG ratio is actually at a 5 year low, indicating the price is lagging the earnings growth on a historic basis. So I am predicting a further move to the upside in price based on that. Ultimately I think Comcast continues to move higher over the long haul. Whether it takes activism to do that or whatever, I don't care. I just know that this company has a lot of potential still ahead of it. It is a slow grower historically, but as of late that has not been the case."
If they make Sky acquisition work like others in the past the stock is cheap
$30 million per year to Rachel Maddow for a weekly show is outrageous. The NBC executives that negotiated this new contract should be fired. It is totally NOT in the interest of shareholders to pay this excessive salary. BTW Comcast ownes NBC if you did not know.
Still undervalued even at these levels.
Lets see what Comcast Does next. Fox is valued at $85 billion enterprise value.Good Luck to the highest bidder
Comcast customer service continues to deteriorate. Spent 6 hours in their chatroom with 7 different people and still have not resolved my internet service problems. Comcast is imploding.
"If you want moderate steady growth, a juicy secure dividend and the ability to sleep at night even if the Stock Market corrects itself, then this is the stock for you,the smart investor. By the way, at some point the market will correct itself as I have seen many times before!"
Great job Comcast
CMCSA is Going Over 67 This Wednesday.
Compare CMCSA to pure play network provider CHTR and CHTR is rewarded. Compare to pure play entertainment provider DIS and DIS is rewarded. CMCSA has world leading assets in each industry and it gets penalized for it. The day will come for CMCSA investors to win big. IMHO
CMCSA works for CCP.....propaganda machine claiming to be 'NEWS' network
"Joe, still with me.."
whatever Brian Roberts is working he needs to announce it soon until he shows what he is doing to bolster Peacock and NBCUniversal to make them stand out in the streaming against now another behemoth this stock will remain like this flat
I’m liking the upward trend! Let’s head back to 40 territory please!
"In the beginning of the summer I predicted Comcast would reach $50. sometime in 2021. It came early. I know it will bounce around and maybe even go back to $47 or $48 but by the end of 2021 we'll be looking at $60. Invest in this thing if you want price, dividend growth and safety!"
"It there any news for the drop today? Not really a big drop, just curios since it's the only red on my portfolio today..."
how many of you think Comcast is undervalued
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Comcast is doing an incredible job bringing us the Olympics. It must be a super complicated endeavor to bring this into our living rooms half way across the world. I am glad I am not the Director.
"Mike, not today my friend, you have a great weekend and be careful."
CMCSA is undervalued . Very good long term buy.
The writing is on the wall.SELL CBS- so that COMCAST can acquire them. $cmcsa
