"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"Hello mr. Hedgefund, can you do TAL $20 please?Thanks!"
$TAL has $4.15 Billion in debt
I'm loading up my truck today.Perfect buying opportunity again
Are you a day trader? Then you need to check out (http://trademarketview.tech). Their daily watchlists are highly researched and take note of the latest stock market news. A must for any investor!
I feel like buying more!
LOL FINALLY BANKRUPTED
The current bond market doesn't reflect the inflation risk because it is distorted by the monetary system. This cannot and will not keep going on forever...
You know. I think its funny that there is a 1yr price target of $47 here. I honestly think that since the price is at 2016 levels its up from here. Look at the chart people its literally at 2015-2016 price levels. The short position is @20%. Do the math. That would mean in theory this is worth $10- $20. Its up to you to do your own DD. I think 10-20 by end of year is not unrealistic. If Wall Street comes in then your looking at $20 easily by Halloween.
"The more negative comments I read here, the more confidence I have in the stock. Yes this is a roller coaster but in time the only way is up. 10 within 3 to six months is very conservative but the only way is up. I will buy more on Monday."
"Yesterday, $GOTU went up 30%. Today, it's TAL's turn to go up 30%+."
End of October incoming with earnings
"Be prepared for the worst next week. The stock price will drop 10% easily on Monday with the news out this weekend 'New Oriental to Lay off over 40,000 Employees; Primary and Junior High School Services to Shut Down'"
There is a person nick name at Twitter Phil 0007 he shorted tal. Guess what soon he will collect pepsi and plastic cans and live under the bridge he has different name at yahoo finance
"""THE LAST PUMP"""
Sold all my TSLA at a huge loss today and bought all in on $GNUS and $TAL …
"Pumpers don't understand China. There is no freedom of ownership in China. Everything you own belongs to the CCP. In order to do business in China, you have to pay bribes to the CCP (includes Apple, Tesla, etc.). CCP wants to turn private enterprises into state-owned ones so CCP officials can get their cut. Strong sell."
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
soon it will go to 10 if they announce diversification plans in vocational schools
"If you understand the business model, you'll never go long. They were charging Chinese students the equivalent of USD (that's the only way to pay the teacher in USD) for a 20-30 min lesson with a foreign teacher. 1 yuan = 0.15 USD. The parents were paying a huge premium for access to a foreign teacher. Once you replace the foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher, the parents have no incentive to pay a premium. Even if the parents paid in yuan, the revenue would be 85% less."
10$$ is coming soon …. Short squeeze anytime ….
bought in at 77$ dollar someone help
If u havent considered the market stupid imagine selling 1 dollar for 65 cents out of desperation. Thats what happens now.Tmrow after EDU discloses earnings and holds shareholder meeting things will be clear.Tal is waiting with a bazooka of 1bln share buyback option holding back whatever they can... they repaid convertibles so they would have no issues to buy back shares in humongous amounts... Just wait for it.Good luck.
"Hey Guys! Get out of short positions! You can't earn much on them. Get up in the long and get x20, if you do not hurry! Buy today for 100,000 - get 2,000,000 in a year. Or call your friends from Reddit, so as not to wait a year"

up 9% this looks very promising.....big short squeeze coming in my opinion as some shorts panic
see you at Monday....
Nice to see $5 for awhile today.
Don’t let them cover cheep.
very soon: see you at $8. results are around next monday
"I seriously dont get it... if you see chinese stocks or TAL in particular as uninvestable just short it or whatever...The way I see it is buying 15 year established business with seasoned management at 0.5 dollars per 1 dollar of net assets, 0.5x price/sales and in a field which is - defensive, growing, not dependent on any supply chain issues, inflation resistant and based in a country with obsession about education... I read all the guidelines, contacted my former colleagues in China about the situation, did really deep DD about audit issues with SEC (with which theyre compliant so far) and from what I could put on a paper this seems like a nobrainer for me. Have 23% of my investments here and it seems just about allright, dont have any other chinese holdings although thinking about pouring some money in LX but not now.Good luck to all people with their investments though shorting this is a suicide guaranteed..."
"shorts, the nightmare is coming...."
Chinese stocks are not investable.
"Bank of America just tripled their position to 82.8M$ USD, they know CNBC is getting paid to publish fake news about China, all part of the plan-demic..."

The sky is the limit buy buy buy
"Love seeing all the shorts promoting delisting, without knowing what’s going on"
Just wondering how you SHORTS are doing today?
"Sell ASAP, bankruptcy soon"
How is nobody talking about that 756K green candle at 3:42p?
"TAL opens at $7, GOTU squeezes to $18 lol ....over 33% short on GOTU"
Is it really true that this stock is trading at 0.5x of its book value while American stocks like Amazon are trading at 20x of that book value. Why is there such a big discrepancy? Aren't the same models applied to the stocks of both countries?
"TAL convertible senior note repurchase is precipitated by terms outlined in the debt instrument. Their are (3) reasons a company would do this ....1. reducing diluted share count ... hmm. these notes are not due to 2026 not this2. terms in debt instrument stipulate if pps falls below certain threshold or LCR the debt instrument can be accelerated and converted to outstanding shares resulting in dilution. The repurchase agreement prevents dilution but depletes cash.3. chinese regulations prevent company from holding or preserving any funding outside of China. Yes, could be this ......Either way it's a development to comply with regulations or to comply with the debt instrument."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
Very positive article about TAL on Seeking Alpha:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4451850-tal-education-buying-every-share-i-can-get-2-0
"CCP will be setting prices from now on.(Bloomberg) -- China said local governments should set the fees for after-school tutoring institutions that offer compulsory education subjects, another step in the country’s efforts to overhaul the private education sector.Local governments should establish benchmark fees and floating ranges, and include them in pricing catalogs, according to a notice from the National Development and Reform Commission. Price increases from the standard level will be capped at 10%. Local governments need to release their standard price for private tutors and related polices by the end of 2021."
It's ready to pop againShorts cover shorts cover
Buy under 5 USDSELL ABOVE 5USDALWAYS DOABLEGO GO GO
Best short. Right here.
This too shall pass. Parents need tutors for their students to be ahead in class. Will be back to double digits sooner. AMEN>
"China stocks are great. Happened 3X before in my 20 years of trading. Each time I made a fortune. GOTU, EDU and TAL have not bounced because regulations are now done. Just waiting for anything new that may come out then investors will jump all over these stocks."
"$EDU and $TAL Couple reasons these are going higher...1-Potential regulations impact K-9, leaving out college/secondary edu and adult.2-Chinese and most Asians/Middle Easterners are big on edu, so I see this as an overreaction. Remember supply and demand. There is enormous demand. 3-With smaller companies closing, it makes life for bigger ones like these easier. Less competition like what COVID did to mom and pop restaurants and retailers in the USMy 2 cents. Best of luck trading."
"Another great day for TAL...looks like $EDU is finally moving up as well. Hopefully, a positive news update will come out soon, and make em both fly. GLTA"
Bankruptcy LOL
"Aaaah finally some fearful guys selling their shares... have my 20k base at 4.17, been waiting a while to add but this interesting, will buy additional 5 to 8k shares at 4.3 and lower... I can wait a year or two and get a huge payout, if you did your DD, this wont make you rich in 3 months but next year im gonna be laughing here...Good luck ppl."
I have an order to buy market price no matter what price it will open hopefully around 7 Then I will watch all my shares skyrocketing the 12 k I bought few weeks ago and the new shares I will buy tomorrow
If no other education companies can now open shop doesn’t that mean the current major players will win the game?
Here we go power hour let us touch 4.75
"lol part of the restriction imposed by the legislature is that they not gonna issue anymore license for after school education premise. Meaning, those with existing market share will dominate the market. and also those with cash issue will shut down and easily acquired by the whale player "
"Regarding the connection between the closing of short positions and an increase in buy volumes: over the last month, there were 3 pullbacks in $ TAL for shorts on 08/30/2021, 09/01/2021 and 09/21/2021, after which almost immediately $ TAL grew rapidly by about 0.9 $. 08/30/2021 short 23% $ TAL gap from 4.75 to 5.71 09/01/2021 short 25% $ TAL gap from 5.01 to 5.87 09/21/2021 closure of shorts from 36 to 25% draw conclusions! All success and income!"
AGAIN=SEE YOU AT $8.
"current TAL 5-5.5 price is ridiculous and reflects a full loss of revenue, let alone earnings. This is not a case anyway despite all regulations. The stock was 90 several months ago and moreover marched from 90 to 20 with a knowledge of coming regulations. I do not want to say that 90 is a right price while 20 is exactly what this stock deserves in this uncertainty. But not 5 that looks for me like a deliberate mockery and humiliation. Same relates to EDU and GOTU and a number of other educational companies."
"I got rating from IBKR, With strong buy from 8, 3 said hold."
"Buy TAL today on this news...vocational pivot...China Education Stocks Jump on Support for Vocational SchoolsBloomberg NewsOctober 13, 2021, 10:08 AM GMT+5:30 Sector gets rare boost after private-tutoring clampdown"
I would’ve been retired by now if shorted these Chinese stocks!
Oversold is an understatement.
Going green thanks for the dip I bought 900 more shares now I am heavily loaded 20 k shares
Just added 5000 units lets go
"exactly when a stock drops 50-70% in one or two weeks it's time to buy. $GOTU, $TAL, $EDU all china stocks hit hard fell from 150 to 2.50. Now they will rebound to $20"
"Some folks are trying to spread FUD as usual saying TAL will get delisted. Delisting does not happen unless there is a fraud or the company is linked to Chinese military. None of that exists here. Look at the chart since Aug 23, higher highs and higher lows. The trend is clear."
Run shorty run !!! And don't say later that I didn't warn you ...

I don’t know why you guys think this is going back up to 100. It’s been downhill for months long before Chinese crack down fears. The plan buy in at 4 or below and hope for maybe 20 to 25 eventually if Lucy and no more bad news.

"Development crisis in China is pure overreaction, stock down 5% of 62.000 volume which is 0.05% of average daily volume... it has nothing to do with education firms, even tech stocks on HKX didnt sell off coz everyone knows this is just too much. 1+m block buys occuring and 13-F filings show that institutions are piling up in a huge way. Just sit back and relax, come back in middle of october and its gonna be fine. Every time you doubt your decision, just repeat that they had 5.4bln revenue, 2.4bln of costs were advertising and sales costs (not employee costs) which will be reduced sigificantly, revenue streams are still intact (policy takes place next year) and theres plenty of time to adjust operations. If even that wasnt enough, you have 5.7bln net assets, debt at 2bln which is around 30% of net assets which is better than most of US companies and management which went through similar crisis in 2012 and 2018 and always came out stronger. Good luck."

HAHA BANKRUPTCY <3
Good news
....see you at $8.....GUESS WHY....
SWEET BANKRUPTCY <3 BAGGIES RIP
"The only question now is - what is the revenue after compulsory regulations? What are the restructuring plans + strategy for years to come?There is no doubt company keeps running, wont go bankrupt coz of steroid balance sheet they have... I hold 16k at avg 4.23 and the only thing that worries me is that they havent disclosed earnings so far...On the other hand there is insane institutional buying considering the ""danger"" here, institutions either dont care or see the picture better than me.I guess the fair value should be around 2-3 times price/sales + net assets which is around 10-14bln when counting 40% current annual revenue to go on.If there is no elephant in the room I cant see seems like a nobrainer to hold."
Get in while it's cheaper again.I'm all in here. You can't go wrong buying at this sprice level.I'm selling above 5USD.THIS WILL POP

Easy 10% profit. Gonna order a new car <3
Just seen the article referred to earlier and would be surprised if it hits $19 by the end of next week but sounds very plausible. I can only hope nobody is shorting this stock because when the regulations are loosened back again it could spring back to the high 30's even 40's quite quickly

The results will support at least 50$ price target. There will be new avenues of income to accommodate low income talented students and we have no problem as an investor we well come equal opportunities.
"Watch out. If Evergrande goes down, TAL and all the others will go down too. Beijing, which has a history of bailing out “too big to fail” corporations, might not be bailing out this goliath. Instead, Beijing could look to protect individual homebuyers and “smaller banks that could be destabilized by a default,” according to CNBC. Suppliers and investors might be left out in the cold. It’s still not clear whether or not Evergrande paid its $83.5 million interest payment on a dollar-denominated bond due today. However, Reuters reported that “some [investors had] given up hope of getting a coupon payment by the deadline.“ The company will have up to 30 days to pay before going into default. There are even more obligations awaiting Evergrande next week.The company has been quiet today, but Chinese officials are supposedly preparing for the fallout. $3333.HK is down 40.4% this month. "
How do you change a publicly-traded for-profit company into a non-profit organization? I am scratching my head.
Monday: $8
Is it me or they have earnings every 2-3 days? I don’t understand
more 3 days: see you at $8....
"Only reasonable arguments below please...So from the fundamental base we had net 5.2bln assets in previous quarter closing.Cash of 5.9bln, debt around 4bln the rest of the equity based in lease rights and short term investments...2bln of the cash is gone for debt reduction, so now we should have around 4bln cash with 2bln debt still in place.Net assets unchanged.1bln share buyback program was authorized during last quarter call so its hardly possible that it was depleted fully at prices above 20 dollars. If they have only 50% of it left they can purchase 20% of the company with it. Given the fact this is the third same crisis management is facing since 2012 and 2018 when almost the same happened I guess they know what to do...Morgan stanley and all the rest of major holders, excluding UBS which is the only holder reducing their stake, are buying like crazy. So given the fact that major players are going in, net assets are twice the size of market cap, revenue stream still around 60-70% intact (given the rules have changed ONLY in beijing and shanghai so far and are announced only for 7 districts out of all the china provinces). My question is, is there anything to fear given the facts above? For disclosure I own 12k shares at 4.17 but thinking about adding 30% more."
Why not check out CLEU. It was expensive before but it is real cheap right now after the selldown. Less than $25mil mkt cap compared to $2bil TAL mkt cap. Do your due DD. This could multiply 10 over times your investment.
"(Bloomberg) -- China has banned firms that teach school subjects from enrolling new students or collecting fees until they’re officially registered as non-profits by the end of 2021.The education ministry now requires those companies to complete their registrations before the end of the year, it said in a notice posted Tuesday."
Good short.
Still cheap. Will not sell a single share.
It’s so funny watching people try to get people to sell at low prices all because they wanted to buy in at a lower price. Give it a break guys you missed it should have bought low so you can sell high

Should be back to $10
I just bought 1000 shares of TAL. Great future share to the moon.
Someone dropped $1 million on Tal today? Down from $80 to 5.5 in the past 6 months. Seems artificial and I think something is about to happen here.

Even gotu with not so good earnings and cash burn went 30% up and kept that gain... guess what happens when they disclose share buyback at atleast a 10% of market cap + killer earnings...Good luck boys and girls.

Interesting observations on TAL. They are buying back all convertible debt due in 2026. GOTU has closed 13 or 15 tutoring sites. GOTU laid off thousands. Will TAL buy GOTU for the subscriber base ? Makes sense consolidation when stocks are down so much. Thoughts ?

"No worries, always when the market opens, short ones try to push down the price so that people are afraid of the price falling and sell their shares, stay long and hold, then you will also get paid"

TAL Whitelisted .... like I said wake up and look at CNBC and see TAL run like SPRT ( EDU also Whitelisted )
Will the have ER this year ?
Adding to short now. Up 20%.
300% up in next two days...This will rise very fast before shorts can cover it....
Not selling my shares under 25 all the good news are pouring here about being able to collect fees for education and upgrades look at Morgan stanly they added more shares millions
FOMO alone will take TAL back to double digits very soon. Imagine what a good news will do to sp. 100% gain in one day!

But students want to learn, and teachers want to teach. Both of them want to earn good money and live well. This cannot be regulated by laws. Therefore, they will reach out to each other and find a way to overcome the barrier set by the government. I bet that the Chinese want to live well"
Unfortunately a lot of shorts are having to tell their kids Santa isn’t coming this year when they see tal climbing another 5% on the Hong Kong market

If we assume TAL's 2022 revenue is cut to $2B+ and P/S is halved:1) P/S (4.4x) * $2B (2022 revenue) = $8.8BAssuming a multiple of 11x current P/S of 0.8 (eg a share price of $61.60)2) $8.8B / $3.61B (current market cap) = 244%+ return
Tomorrow is a day TAL
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"

"Apologies as I have just realised this forum is mostly shorts trying to put people off buying into this stock, the last thing they want to read is a good news story. The business is fundamentally very sound and actually makes a lot of money outside of China. The Chinese Government have realised that actually disincentivizing private tutoring will only lead to their neighbours getting a head start on them. I can see them relaxing things a little and this is genuinely an $80 stock so even $60 would be a conservative price for this to return to. Granted it could take a few months to recover back to those levels but an amazing return for the patient Long on this stock."

"Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. ""STRONG BUY"" You lose short stuff!"
"Now the price includes the risk that the management will withdraw capital from the company. As soon as it becomes clear that management is taking reasonable steps to preserve and increase capital, the shares will soar. I think that the company is run by smart, experienced and decent people. The shares will regain their losses. We will get +2000% over time."

"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tal-education-group-announces-repurchase-of-convertible-senior-notes-due-2026-301364197.htmlThis is excellent news and proof of TAL's planning for a long and successful future:""Why do companies repurchase notes?Why should a company repurchase its debt? There are a number of reasons a company might consider repurchasing its debt, including, but not limited to: reducing interest expenses; ... repurchasing debt securities at a discount to their principal amount when the market price for the securities is below par value.Apr 8, 2020""Of course they expect to survive if they are repurchasing debt. But the other main positive is that, as mentioned above, when their share price is below par value, as is the case right now, they are able to negotiate debt repurchase at a discount to their principal amount (this is usually done when they think their securities price has hit the bottom) before the share price go way back up again which is what they expect hence buying debt now."
