"The more negative comments I read here, the more confidence I have in the stock. Yes this is a roller coaster but in time the only way is up. 10 within 3 to six months is very conservative but the only way is up. I will buy more on Monday."
I would’ve been retired by now if shorted these Chinese stocks!

"TAL Education Group (TAL) has appointed Dr. Alex Zhuangzhuang Peng, currently the Vice President of Strategy, as the Chief Financial Officer ((CFO)), effective from November 1, 2021News from today"
very strong growth today
sell before going down to $2.
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while TAL barley does anything at all."
Survey time: are you a $90 or $5 bag holder?
"Some folks are trying to spread FUD as usual saying TAL will get delisted. Delisting does not happen unless there is a fraud or the company is linked to Chinese military. None of that exists here. Look at the chart since Aug 23, higher highs and higher lows. The trend is clear."
"Dust has settled... regulations make sense, are harsh but more than 50% of revenue is still intact, field cleared of steroid VC-funded companies, market cap still at 50% of net assets... cash at 4bln... nah, not selling a dime. Will consider selling 20% at 15-18 to recover base"
"JP Morgan closed their 10% position when the stock fell from $20 to $4TAL issued 10% stock to JP Morgan so that they can have their 10% back.Don't worry, it's just a bribe. The news are actually EXTREMELY BULLISH"

"Hello mr. Hedgefund, can you do TAL $20 please?Thanks!"
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"

Sell. It’ll never recover. Cut your losses and move on. You’ll only lose more by holding.
"Time to make money again, get on the board now :) Thank you for cheap price."
"I bought more, I won't sell less than 20, even if you cut me"
Another tactic on these turnaround plays is to make you wonder why it's not going up when the rest of the market is.Buy and hold.

Time to RISE!
"Only reasonable arguments below please...So from the fundamental base we had net 5.2bln assets in previous quarter closing.Cash of 5.9bln, debt around 4bln the rest of the equity based in lease rights and short term investments...2bln of the cash is gone for debt reduction, so now we should have around 4bln cash with 2bln debt still in place.Net assets unchanged.1bln share buyback program was authorized during last quarter call so its hardly possible that it was depleted fully at prices above 20 dollars. If they have only 50% of it left they can purchase 20% of the company with it. Given the fact this is the third same crisis management is facing since 2012 and 2018 when almost the same happened I guess they know what to do...Morgan stanley and all the rest of major holders, excluding UBS which is the only holder reducing their stake, are buying like crazy. So given the fact that major players are going in, net assets are twice the size of market cap, revenue stream still around 60-70% intact (given the rules have changed ONLY in beijing and shanghai so far and are announced only for 7 districts out of all the china provinces). My question is, is there anything to fear given the facts above? For disclosure I own 12k shares at 4.17 but thinking about adding 30% more."
LAST CHANCE TO BUY LOW!
YUGE GAINS!Baggies <3
bought in at 77$ dollar someone help
"Sell ASAP, bankruptcy soon"
"Under $4 soon, better buy insurance from pumpers."
Volume is a joke... lowest since policy was announced and stock barely moves... guess tmrow after edu shareholder meeting we will see a trend reversal. Even gotu with not so good earnings and cash burn went 30% up and kept that gain... guess what happens when they disclose share buyback at atleast a 10% of market cap + killer earnings...Good luck boys and girls.
"$WIMI $YMM $TAL Got a freebie for you guys ! This should be a temporary bottom,get ready to play the bounce!"
I have a feeling of this stock can touch $7 it will fly to $18 there is no resistance at $6-$7 look at the chart. But what do I know?! Speculation and high hopes ... buy and hold!
Best investment ever. LOL
Baggies are gettin shafted by bankrupt company <3
rocket at 20
I heard about TAL the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"OneSmart Education is still halted, they are using our money to manipulate other stocks how is that legal? Lol"
"KEEP HODLING, BK COMING <3"
So scared. Have to load more to calm down.
"I seriously dont get it... if you see chinese stocks or TAL in particular as uninvestable just short it or whatever...The way I see it is buying 15 year established business with seasoned management at 0.5 dollars per 1 dollar of net assets, 0.5x price/sales and in a field which is - defensive, growing, not dependent on any supply chain issues, inflation resistant and based in a country with obsession about education... I read all the guidelines, contacted my former colleagues in China about the situation, did really deep DD about audit issues with SEC (with which theyre compliant so far) and from what I could put on a paper this seems like a nobrainer for me. Have 23% of my investments here and it seems just about allright, dont have any other chinese holdings although thinking about pouring some money in LX but not now.Good luck to all people with their investments though shorting this is a suicide guaranteed..."
"today, the infusion of money in China"
"(Bloomberg) -- China has banned firms that teach school subjects from enrolling new students or collecting fees until they’re officially registered as non-profits by the end of 2021.The education ministry now requires those companies to complete their registrations before the end of the year, it said in a notice posted Tuesday."
I’m long. Please keep shorting this stock.

It will be $7.00
"Before the new regulations, parents were paying the equivalent of USD for ESL lessons. Now they will be paying in Chinese yuan for ""vocational training."""
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
The results will support at least 50$ price target. There will be new avenues of income to accommodate low income talented students and we have no problem as an investor we well come equal opportunities.
I am staying far away from TAL - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
very soon: buyback....see you at $8.
I don't think that TAL has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com the other day and their stocks are way better...
Friendly advice… if you’re short I suggest you cover now to save your marriage
Sweet bankruptcy <3Poor baghodlers <3
ALL TIME LOW is almost here. DO NOT HOLD.

Just wondering how you SHORTS are doing today?
Love the Buying opportunity!
"Xiangdong Chen, the Company's founder, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""In the second quarter of 2021, our revenue has reached a r-e--c-o--r-d high to 2.232 billion RMB. .TAL IS NEXT....."
"The only question now is - what is the revenue after compulsory regulations? What are the restructuring plans + strategy for years to come?There is no doubt company keeps running, wont go bankrupt coz of steroid balance sheet they have... I hold 16k at avg 4.23 and the only thing that worries me is that they havent disclosed earnings so far...On the other hand there is insane institutional buying considering the ""danger"" here, institutions either dont care or see the picture better than me.I guess the fair value should be around 2-3 times price/sales + net assets which is around 10-14bln when counting 40% current annual revenue to go on.If there is no elephant in the room I cant see seems like a nobrainer to hold."
Tall will be over five end of the week
Higher lows and higher highs. The trend is clear
"The best way to maintain political power is to control ideological education through internet. What's better than overtaking the control of a well, privately built company. Look for not only price control, but sadly, content as well. Crack down won't ease for a while, at least until they feel more secure about where the party stands."
When is the earning ?
"Love seeing all the shorts promoting delisting, without knowing what’s going on"

Long 20 long 20
How do you change a publicly-traded for-profit company into a non-profit organization? I am scratching my head.
"Apologies as I have just realised this forum is mostly shorts trying to put people off buying into this stock, the last thing they want to read is a good news story. The business is fundamentally very sound and actually makes a lot of money outside of China. The Chinese Government have realised that actually disincentivizing private tutoring will only lead to their neighbours getting a head start on them. I can see them relaxing things a little and this is genuinely an $80 stock so even $60 would be a conservative price for this to return to. Granted it could take a few months to recover back to those levels but an amazing return for the patient Long on this stock."
Fell below support at 4.25 down to 4 maybe lower. Grap stock
Long 20

Back to 90 in three Years
"Development crisis in China is pure overreaction, stock down 5% of 62.000 volume which is 0.05% of average daily volume... it has nothing to do with education firms, even tech stocks on HKX didnt sell off coz everyone knows this is just too much. 1+m block buys occuring and 13-F filings show that institutions are piling up in a huge way. Just sit back and relax, come back in middle of october and its gonna be fine. Every time you doubt your decision, just repeat that they had 5.4bln revenue, 2.4bln of costs were advertising and sales costs (not employee costs) which will be reduced sigificantly, revenue streams are still intact (policy takes place next year) and theres plenty of time to adjust operations. If even that wasnt enough, you have 5.7bln net assets, debt at 2bln which is around 30% of net assets which is better than most of US companies and management which went through similar crisis in 2012 and 2018 and always came out stronger. Good luck."

They were charging Chinese students the equivalent of USD (that's the only way to pay the teacher in USD) for a 20-30 min lesson with a foreign teacher. 1 yuan = 0.15 USD. The parents were paying a huge premium for access to a foreign teacher. Once you replace the foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher, the parents have no incentive to pay a premium. Even if the parents paid in yuan, the revenue would be 85% less."

Someone dropped $1 million on Tal today? Down from $80 to 5.5 in the past 6 months. Seems artificial and I think something is about to happen here.
