"The correction came out without fanfare. They manipulators got what they needed.UPDATE] A new report from Digitimes now suggests that ""component suppliers for Appleâ€™s new iPhones have claimed no cutback in orders thus far this year."" This suggests that the iPhone 13 production is still on schedule. Speaking further, the supplier has also commented that there is no doubt regarding Apple's ability to meet the iPhone 13 demand."
Market's response to the TXN ER is not good for SWKS.
"Folks, Do NOT fall for that LOW volume selloff.Buy/Hold"
"Hopefully most of the damage has already been done in the Apple suppliers. I'm weighted very heavy in the semi space with the most being NXPI, followed by QRVO, QCOM, followed by SWKS, and then MU, and finally AMD. Regardless of the supply constraints now there is no denying the future of these companies. Hopefully QRVO and SWKS were able to mitigate some of the issues Apple had."
"So, this is laughable. So we have some analyst ( 2 weeks) before earnings to downgrade Swks, Mu and other Semis after they already been down. See the pattern guys. Most Techs been bouncing back from the lows this past week."
"This is what happens when Apple is your largest customer and they have disappointing quarterly results. Just watch, this stock will sink to $150 after earnings release next week."
Haven't checked on SWKS since I sold it @ $175. Amazed to see it has dropped so far. The latest leg down due to lower iPhone production. Assuming supply chain issues are rectified it's just a screaming buy down here on a go forward basis. Since SWKS owns their foundries production on their end shouldn't be the problem (unless they have labor issues).......but demand from end users is because of other shortages.
"Holly sht @Liem, LCID up 45% today! Hope you still in it Plug up close to 10% too."
The supply chain issues responsible for Apple's miss this past quarter won't necessarily correlate to SWKS sales for this past qtr. It's likely SWKS delivered and got paid for the chips that Apple had planned to need for it's iPhone assemblies. There are several other bottlenecks responsible. Next quarter however may be affected however if Apple's CM has now adjusted its purchasing to match the lowered forecast.
AAPL iphone 13 pro has (2) front-end modules from SWKS:Skyworks SKY58276-17 front-end moduleSkyworks SKY58271-19 front-end module
"From a Seeking Alpha article:""According to Bloomberg, ""people with knowledge of the matter"" say that Apple will cut its iPhone 13 targets by as many as 10 million devices due issues affecting suppliers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The two companies provide communications chips and technology for the iPhone, but like many in the chip sector this year, they have has had their own supply chains disrupted due to shortfalls of key semiconductor-making parts"""
SWKS is so cheap at these prices. We are undervalued by 40-50%. I will keep adding - its like free $$ flow longer term.
After Huawei and Apple disappointments this stock will be $150 after earnings release next Thursday.
"""The Apple CEO estimated that the supply constraints totaled around $6B for the quarter. He sees an even larger impact in the current quarter, although he did not provide an exact estimate"""
AAPL ER Oct 28th. What do you expect?
Do your DD. SWKS is a $300 stock. They make special chips for our government and of course they are in 5g space.This stock is very Undervalue compare to it's immense potential.Do Not let Hedgies force you to sell.
Someone downgraded today on secular slowdown what ever that means
So painful watching Nancy speak. Almost as painful as watching Slo Joe speak. It's time they are put out to pasture. It would be humane! That's where thoroughbreds go.
"Three weeks away from earnings release. Anyone care to guess if they beat on revenue, earnings or raise future guidance? Would be interested to hear your thoughts Lawrence, DDule etc."
"A couple of months ago SWKS, QRVO and NVDA we're all at about $190. Today SWKS down to $160, $30 bucks down. NVDA $220, $30 bucks up. I suggested to get into NVDA. If you did you would be a whole $60 bucks better. Did anyone make a move?"
