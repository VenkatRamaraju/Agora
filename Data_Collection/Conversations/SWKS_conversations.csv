"Slightly soft guidance, but that's already been more than priced in because of the AAPL report and tariff fears. Hard to tell where ""chartists"" will take this in the next few days and weeks, though. Share price is still low based on fundamentals, so patients should be rewarded."
After Huawei and Apple disappointments this stock will be $150 after earnings release next Thursday.
This rebounds back to $190 and beyond no problem. Just doubled my position. I like this stock
"Funny headline: Wireless-Chip Maker Skyworks Squeaks By Second-Quarter Targets.Let's get real. They dramatically increased guidance just over a month ago and then beat that. So if they said nothing a month ago they beat by over 50%. They have also guided higher for next QTR and based on earnings at a 182 price that's a 17 PE. They've been touted as a 1 trick pony to AAPL, They buy the unit from Silicon to help expand their product base. Expect those earnings number to increase going forward once the deal is complete. They already stated they would have 1B net cash AFTER the deal. That's why I hate preannouncements."
"SWKS is a profit machine. Gross margin 48.1 percent, operating margin 26.6 percent, net margins are 24.3 percent. Zero debt, nearly a billion dollars in cash, and just under a billion in free cash flow. And explosive growth predicted for this year. What's not like?"
Its been stagnant for months. dead money for now while accumulation continue.
"Jim Cramer from Mad Money has Marvell, Qorvo and Skyworks in his 5G top 3. So far they are all doing great. 5G is going to be absolutely massive. $MRVL $QRVO $SWKS"
little for sale on this up day. perhaps the short selling is now done . . . for the year ahead? not a recommendation.
The 5G top 3 raised by Citi analyst Atif Malik today;Marvell raised to $64 from $50Qorvo raised to $188 from at $144 Skyworks raised to $164 from at $137$MRVL $QRVO $SWKS
Looks like SWKS is coming down with the Apple flu.
You should see some of the price targets with some analysts. I'm glad I got in right before the start of this rise. Because it's going a lot higher.
"Just a quick note to the SWKS longs, shorts and potential investors. The MU earnings report that seems to have crashed all the chip stocks was actually really good news for Skyworks if you read through it. Their short fall was not chip demand as they still can't produce enough chips but the mounting components for the chips are not keeping up with the manufacturing demand. Fortunately for us SWKS investors we don't have that issue! Just keep adding shares at these cheap prices because we'll be back at $185 when the smoke clears! Cheers Longs..."
I wonder is Apple’s $420 billion increase in U.S. spending includes buying out Skyworks? I hope not. Skyworks will be a $100 billion market cap company soon on their own. That is $600 a share before any potential stock split.
Too cheap to pass up

All’s well with me here. Sitting near the bottom of the 6 mth. and 1 yr. trend line.
Let's rally Swks Up Up and Away!
"SWKS relative performance has been improving for several days. Today opened above near term resistance, and is now sitting just above 50d MA. Beginning to look like an upward move going to happen. Disclosure: long. not a recommendation. do your own dd."
It may take a few weeks but I'm looking for a $140s re-entry point. In a session of panic this thing could drop another 10% plus.
"Thank God for Apple and iPhone. SWKS surely is doing really well having that customer.But ... search for the ""S21 Ultra iFixit teardown"". There, QCOM cleaned up 100% in RFFE. The S21 looks like they adapted the WHOLE QCOM modem-to-antenna design. No SWKS, QRVO or AVGO parts in it, not that iFixIt identified. However, positive thing here is that the whole S21 family most likely will not sell more 25-30 million units.So, QCOM is making inroads in RFFE. In their last quarterly report they claim, from what I remember, about $1B in RF Front End sales."
This is a cool stock
What’s everyone’s price targets 5 years from now?
"Hate to trade this horse, but the numbers no longer make sense at this multiple after the stock split. I think i'll take my profits and move it over to more sensible valuations, like $AMD $SWKS $TSM"
"Grateful for this selloff it's given me an opportunity to double my SWKS position. This stock is a clear winner along with the rest of the semis. The chip shortage is a boon for their stock prices and demand being greater than supply=massive gains long term, vs. several years ago the market was flooded with chips and semi stock prices cratered. Economics is an important factor to consider when looking at industries to invest in. If demand is greater than supply that's exactly the type of thing I'm looking for."
Something to note.. any good stock including SWKS jumps after monthly options expiry dates..
One positive thing: SWKS pps surpassed that of QRVO. LOL
SWKS almost always drops even with an earnings beat. Same happened last quarter and a few days later the stock has broken $140.If you actually follow the FINANCIALS instead of minute by minute price movements then you’ll know that the share price will be gaining over the next 3 months. My price target is $165

"SWKS basically pre announced their quarter minus a forecast. Solid results in this environment,"
"Oh man, this really sucks. Not just SWKS but also other semi sticks. Will SWKS go into $150s? Back in the Summer 2015, stock was $118. Today, six years later it's just about only $40 higher. So much for holding it long. But it's a great trading stock, if nothing else."
"Hey Bmycadi, you would have muted me a long time ago on the Qualcomm board. QCOM is much worse then Skyworks and has been the biggest piece of  of any 5G semiconductor play as well as all semiconductor chips since Jan. 1st of this year."
"Maybe today 100$, it looks strong so far :). Finally mobile market is waking up :)"
SWKS is so cheap at these prices. We are undervalued by 40-50%. I will keep adding - its like free $$ flow longer term.
AAPL iphone 13 pro has (2) front-end modules from SWKS:Skyworks SKY58276-17 front-end moduleSkyworks SKY58271-19 front-end module
"Target price lifted by research analysts at Mizuho from $195.00 to $207.00 in a note issued to investors on Friday, The Fly reports. The brokerage currently has a “buy” rating on the semiconductor manufacturer’s stock. Mizuho’s target price would suggest a potential upside of 9.14% from the stock’s previous close"
now that Apple has announced its earning date I would imagine several companies will follow suit based on how they think Apple may impact their quarterly announcement
"This stock is a stonk.Everyone who is selling better listen to all the past three earnings conference calls. I never have seen Liam Griffin so bullish on SWKS.1. Earnings growing again at the rate of 25-30% and ACCELERATING!2. Revenues growing again at 20-25% and ACCELERATING!3. They own their own fabs (not dependent on TSM or AMAT) - full control of their manufacturing.4. SWKS is utilizing their production capacity at maximum. Every wireless product manufacturer/OEM including car companies hoarding chips and afraid to run out and stocking up whatever they can buy.5. More companies introducing new wireless devices - Apple just announced they are introducing new products this April 20 (Titled the reveal event ""Spring Loaded"" and Invitation going on)1Q21 will be a blowout as guided last 4Q20 report and that was a blowout. Many more quarters to come and all bottom lines accelerating!This is a buy. Technicals strong - Volatility Compression ongoing. About to spike up!"
This is a nice correction from where I sold this ($201). I have a bid in at $175.55. There is a demand for chips and in the upcoming months Skyworks will find a way to profit from the demand.
Does SWKS need a booster shot? Sleepy B_den got one today.
"Up she goes, Like I say, these down grades are so transparent!"
If I were Liam (SWKS CEO) i would confidently further raise the guidance! 1. SWKS hiring thousands to meet demand. 2. More dollar revenue per 5G chip. More devices than ever that requires wireless capabilities. 3. Apple boosting iphone production by 30% in 20214. Healthier balance sheet than Qorvo5. Room to improve to match Qorvo’s marginsThis company will beat a 20% revenue growth and beat the 25% earnings growth12-month PT is $230!
Add another catalyst to the mix. Apple replacing the lower cost mini phone with a 5G enabled phone. Assuming that means more Skyworks product based on that news.
"Folks, Do NOT fall for that LOW volume selloff.Buy/Hold"
"Looking to add more. Every human soul on Earth is going to deal with wireless. 5G is going to be part of their life, just how 4G and 3G were in the past. Then there's SWKS's automotive chip division. Every new car is going to have 5G wireless. I read something about GM bypassing the chip suppliers and going direct to the manufacturers. Uncertain on how this plan would work. $200 by year end is easy - what about in 2022 and 2023?"
"xinngai Chan, predicts that ""5G content growth and a strong position at AAPL should position SWKS to outperform its peer group."" While ""5G content growth will benefit RF companies overall,"" Chan is particularly keen on Skyworks stock because ""Huawei will lose market share to AAPL and other smartphone OEMs in 2020,"" and therefore, suppliers ""that have high(er) exposure to Apple"" are likely to better than those that do not. In this regard, Chan argues, ""we believe SWKS is the best RF name positioned to outperform its peer group in 2020,"" which is why he considers the stock one of the ""2020 best ideas in semiconductors."""
"So, this is laughable. So we have some analyst ( 2 weeks) before earnings to downgrade Swks, Mu and other Semis after they already been down. See the pattern guys. Most Techs been bouncing back from the lows this past week."
"Ahh Simon, 12:37 today's volume past the average daily volume."

Market's response to the TXN ER is not good for SWKS.
"What? The volume is low! The volume at 12:30 is almost as much as the daily average volume. Todays volume will surpass/crush the average volume. Therefore, how can you claim volume is low."

"A couple of months ago SWKS, QRVO and NVDA we're all at about $190. Today SWKS down to $160, $30 bucks down. NVDA $220, $30 bucks up. I suggested to get into NVDA. If you did you would be a whole $60 bucks better. Did anyone make a move?"
"Hopefully most of the damage has already been done in the Apple suppliers. I'm weighted very heavy in the semi space with the most being NXPI, followed by QRVO, QCOM, followed by SWKS, and then MU, and finally AMD. Regardless of the supply constraints now there is no denying the future of these companies. Hopefully QRVO and SWKS were able to mitigate some of the issues Apple had."
"Wow, this is one of the quietest boards I've ever seen.. I like it! One of the others things I've seen over the past 30 years of trading is the Hedge Funds, Market Makers and shorts trying to feed off the weak hands and rumors to drive the share price down and then load up on shares before the big run up.. Been there, seen it and done it many of times. I thinks the investors on this board are aware of this and know that SWKS is going to kill earnings.. Oh, and yes there is a huge chip storage which won't get resolved until 2024! I'm buying all I can afford at this price because I know for a fact this stock will be over $200 by the end of the year. Cheer's Longs"
"Real Money 6-3-20:""Bottom line strategy: SWKS may or may not pull back for a slightly better buying point so traders should do some buying at current levels. Risk a close below $115 for now. $140 and then the $200 area are our price targets."""

"Btw, if you compare PEs for Qorvo, Qualcomm, and Skyworks you’ll see that Skyworks has the lowest PE by far. So Skyworks hasn’t experienced as much multiple growth as Qualcomm and Qorvo has. That could change at anytime..."
It's very possible that yesterday's low of $154.53 was the low. Risk factor: China invading Taiwan.
166.00 will add more
Shorts must be getting nervous about earnings!
BUY on weakness !
"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....fabless companies $NVDA $AMD and now $QCOM all reporting incredible ER's with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Semi manufactures like $TSM $TXN all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers like $QRVO and $SWKS will likely reports similar strong ER's this week. Semi equipment companies like $ASML (destroyed earnings) $LRCX $AMAT are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The semiconductor industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this industry right now and many of the stocks, particularly semi equipment stocks are looking like value plays ($AMAT and $LRCX especially undervalued)."
Do your DD. SWKS is a $300 stock. They make special chips for our government and of course they are in 5g space.This stock is very Undervalue compare to it's immense potential.Do Not let Hedgies force you to sell.
"Cost of the deal is $2.75 billion. SWKS is buying $400 million of high margin revenue. Paying 7x for the revenue is pretty standard. Very solid deal! Diversification, high margins & double digit growth."
"Facts: 25% profit margins, 17% quarterly earnings growth, and very tiny debt...all while being one of the best companies for 5G and iOT. Selling now is very short-sighted. Now an incredible bargain for both long and short term."
"Actually, there is a good side to jobs report which the BIG WIGS will spin either late today or early Monday.This is that a Weak Jobs Report also means the FED Will Less likely to Taper or taper very little"
"Market is over reacting. Maybe to scare weal hands. They should rerate down the Teslas, the other high growth no earnings stocks! But SWKS is now back to a forward PE of 15. That’s fairly valued if revenues and earnings are growing at 7-8%. BUT - SWKS is growing revenues at 20-25% and earnings by 25-30%, no debt, has dividends and lots of cash! This is the most undervalued tech stock with an accelerated growth in coming years! Obvious Strong BUY! Nothing that happened in the past few weeks (10-year rate from 0.9% to 1.6% even if at 2%) has changed the business trajectory !"
"Not sure the extent to which acquired slab division is reflected in QR estimates. Given uncertainty as to timing of closing, bumping guidance by a nickel may fall short of expectations of the earnings contribution of the purchase.My recollection is that the division should add at least 20 cents per quarter to eps, without any growth applied to the 400 mil in sales, which was the run rate at the time the deal was announced. Hoping this point is clarified in the call."
"""The Apple CEO estimated that the supply constraints totaled around $6B for the quarter. He sees an even larger impact in the current quarter, although he did not provide an exact estimate"""
Its down but on low volume. This is actually a bull situation where low volume + price increase are the last paper hands leaving before the bulls take over
Mucho Dinero Mucho Problema
AAPL ER Oct 28th. What do you expect?
A close above 103.33 would clear all the major moving averages. Could 110 be next if that happens?
Hot mess
"Did a little number crunching with the limited info available. I'm speculating that earnings estimates are going to increase substantially as the revenue projections increase. Current earnings estimate for this FY is 7.56. We know that's low. High estimate is 8.12. That seems well within their grasp. That's a 32.5% growth rate from the prior year 6.13. High estimate for 9/22 eps is 10.32 (consensus is 8.59 currently). That's 27% growth on the 8.12. Consider what 9/23 might be. Assuming a 25% growth rate, that's 12.90. It's not a ridiculous number by any stretch as that's still well within the 5G transition period.IF, IF, IF they hit growth numbers, the PE at which this trades could easily double. It's currently about 17.25 on 9/22 earnings of 8.59.So in 1 year, we could easily be looking at forward earnings estimates of 12.90. Applying a 34.5 forward PE to 12.90 estimated 9/23 earnings produces a value of $445. A 25 multiple produces a price of $322.50. Applying a euphoric 40 to the 12.90 gives a value of $516. Pie in the sky? Maybe.What if the FY23 estimate is $11.50 rather than 12.90? and the forward PE is a more modest 20? That's still $230 a share in 1 year. 55% higher.The point is SWKS should be going much higher. At some point, the market is going to be forced to recognize the value. The company just has to continue to execute.If they start hitting their growth numbers, some underperforming company with tons of cash who needs growth just might be willing to step in with a bid. Say INTC. Or a company who wants to add a complementary line of business to their existing products - AMD maybe. How about a bidding war between those 2 rivals?It also strikes me that as the stock values of prospective buyers increase while SWKS lags, SWKS becomes a more attractive target for a stock deal. SWKS is going higher."
Will this stock ever hit $200? Feels like its been stuck in the mud for 6 months.
"This thing is been like watching paint dry lately, what the heck is holding it back? Low PE, solid market, semi boom, chip shortages should be tail winds￼"
177.00 a BUY...................................
Yes. Below $160. Now let's see if it closes below$160.
The supply chain issues responsible for Apple's miss this past quarter won't necessarily correlate to SWKS sales for this past qtr. It's likely SWKS delivered and got paid for the chips that Apple had planned to need for it's iPhone assemblies. There are several other bottlenecks responsible. Next quarter however may be affected however if Apple's CM has now adjusted its purchasing to match the lowered forecast.
"THE LAST 6 months haven't been too good, but just know... 5G is HERE... just buy SWKS, QRVO, and MRVL... that's IT!... they're ALL gonna double over the next 10 months. Easy call."

"nice opportunity to add a few shares here if it fits your portfolio allocation. PE at roughly trailing 17. Debt virtually nonexistent; they can bring it down to 0 where it was pre-acquisition or buy back shares. Their cash flow allows them options that most companies only dream of. SWKS is always a stock that moves to extremes on any news, so not worried here.Curbie2"
Cramer's really touting this baby.
"Ok, this is dropping more and more. Anything below $150 is a SCREAMING BUY!"
"B. Riley Securities sees interesting opportunities in SkyworksB. Riley Securities analyst Craig Ellis notes that Taiwan January sales were mixed at high level as signs of above-seasonal first half of 2021 build. Despite some near-term digestion in PC and Networking, which may include low-end mix shift, data affirms broadening end market strength into a 2021 up-cycle and supports his constructive industry view, with its further support from year-to-date reporting. Tactically, Ellis recommends adding on pullbacks, seeing ""particularly interesting"" 12-month opportunities in Alpha & Omega (AOSL), Cohu (COHU), FormFactor (FORM), Onto Innovation (ONTO), Silicon Motion (SIMO), ON Semiconductor (ON), and Skyworks (SWKS). The firm has Buy ratings on all the stocks.(the fly)"
"Very Low volume, Guess everybody got scare off these several weeks"
"Stephen Weiss on CNBC said this 3 day sell-off due to the AAPL report is baseless and a gift to investors looking to buy more SWKS,which he has just done himself."
"The Wedbush downgrade doesn't make any sense. You can't have $SWKS and $LRCX upgraded on 5G demand, and $NVDA and $AMD upgraded on upcoming console demand, and not have $MU caught up in there somewhere. This reminds me of the Q4 19 earnings when MU was 'rumored' to be finally posting their expected down-cycle loss only to show 1/2 billion in profit. That head-turning beat launched the stock from the $40's to over $60. I suspect something similar may happen again with ER on 29th."
Interesting writeup that covers SWKS. Projections in the article call for a 120 price and an increase in the divided. Any thoughtshttp://mvpstockpicks.com/how-to-play-the-5g-boom-that-is-coming-best-stocks-to-consider/

SWKS has proprietary technology Apple can't replace. The selloff is an algo driven event. I added a few shares @ $141.00.
"Well guys, Apple went from 8 SWKS chips in iPhone 12 Pro, down to just 2 in iPhone 13 Pro. What gives?Still waiting for 13 Pro Max teardowns."
"Fabless, 50-100 employees, 100 patents, founders still involved, privately held. This reminds me of when SWKS bought privately held SiGe.""Avnera has deep analog and mixed-signal circuit design expertise, including the know-how to integrate diverse circuit types onto single pieces of silicon. As such, Avnera IC's integrate RF, power management, audio data converters, host interfaces, & programmable DSPs onto low-cost CMOS, enabling very high performance at low total system cost."""
"I received SWKS's 2020 annual report in the mail this past Saturday.Note: For the three years of 2018, 2019 & 2020 SWKS repurchased 22.9 million shares of their stock @ a cost of $2.06 Billion."
Haven't checked on SWKS since I sold it @ $175. Amazed to see it has dropped so far. The latest leg down due to lower iPhone production. Assuming supply chain issues are rectified it's just a screaming buy down here on a go forward basis. Since SWKS owns their foundries production on their end shouldn't be the problem (unless they have labor issues).......but demand from end users is because of other shortages.
"So, buying back at 140'ish?"

Please refer to the attached Discussion Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this press release for a further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures, including quantification of known expected adjustment items.“We expect the continued and rapid adoption of multiple wireless protocols to drive strong year-over-year growth for Skyworks,” said Kris Sennesael, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Skyworks. “Specifically, in the second fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.175 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 at the midpoint of our revenue range, representing revenue growth of 50% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 75%, compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020.“Additionally, our board of directors has approved a new $2 billion stock repurchase program, reflecting their confidence in our business model driven by sustained above-market growth and strong cash flow generation.”"
"Be patient everyone this is not going up like Game Stop or AMC Theateres but in time it will rise. It has beat estimates for the past 5 qtrs and the 1st qtr of 2021 on January 28th was a Huge beat. Next Qtr is already reported to be a record too and on and on they go. Besides making chips for almost all handset manufactures they also make chips to go into telecommunication equipment that will be used for rolling out 5G around the Globe. I just mentioned 2 big things that they make but there are many other smaller things that make and sell that also generate profit for them too. This is a good company, well managed and returns most of its profit back to its share holders in the form of Share Buybacks. $2 Billion just approved for share repurchase through 2023. This $2 billion will eliminate 7% of their available shares that are currently on the market. That can only help to raise the share price. They also pay a healthy $2 per share dividend every year. So you can sit back and watch the cash or dividend reinvestment kick in every quarter. I have owned my shares since 2015 and after this latest run up on Monday I can definitely say I have enjoyed the show and the profit so far. I look forward to a huge 2021 and 2022 for this company and my prediction (it and $1 will get you any size drink at McDonald's LOL) for the share price of SWKS is $250 by the end of 2021 and $320 by the third quarter of 2022. These share predictions of mine are conservative of course and in reality could be much higher. Either way it is all future retirement money anyway. GLTA = Good Luck To All"
I hold this stock for 5 years and finally moving upward!
Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley reiterated a Buy rating on Skyworks Solutions yesterday and set a price target of $230.00. The company’s shares closed last Wednesday at $175.25.
"20 years ago I worked for Rockwell Semi. They split up into 3 companies: Conexant/Mindspeed/Skyworks and I received shares in each. Conexant and Mindspeed went belly up so I thought ""what the hell, let the Skyworks shares ride..."" I have 1k shares with a cost basis of $7. Hopefully, it will be enough to pay for one of my children's college education in ~2 years."
"I think SWKS will need to show them the money on the next ER (2 months from now). Just like my other 2 5G stock holdings. All are in the doldrums right now and the whole chip shortage is hanging over their outlooks. But I have faith that the 5G rollout continues in phones and other IOT uses. The quarterly reports will be strong and then after those 2Q reports, we head upwards.Long and Strong, just trying to be patient."

"From a Seeking Alpha article:""According to Bloomberg, ""people with knowledge of the matter"" say that Apple will cut its iPhone 13 targets by as many as 10 million devices due issues affecting suppliers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The two companies provide communications chips and technology for the iPhone, but like many in the chip sector this year, they have has had their own supply chains disrupted due to shortfalls of key semiconductor-making parts"""
It has been drifting South Pole since earnings.
Let's see if this can close under $160 today.
"I'm a shareholder since 2005. What did SWKS do to protect my investment in their March quarter? They repurchased 3.2 million shares, paid a .44 cent dividend, have $1.1 billion in cash with zero debt."
"Mizuho raises to ""buy"" and target price from 90 to 132. ""meaningful upside"" from 5G opportunities"
"I've owned SKWS since the merger between Alpha Industries and Conexant almost 20 years ago. Conexant holders were given ""free"" shares in that deal. The Apple connection has dogged SWKS for years and rightfully so. Finally I got tired of worrying about it and decided to hedge it. After watching AAPL for years they announced a 7 for 1 split in 2014 which gave me an entry point of roughly $95/share so right before the split I bought 100 shares. Then I had 700 shares. A few weeks ago AAPL split 4:1 and my 700 shares became 2800 shares. My $9500 entry point [100 shares x $95] is now worth $322,000. I don't worry anymore about SWKS nor AAPL. When 5G is fully ramped the AAPL & SWKS combination will complete a nice set of investments. AAPL is now about $115/share and will hit $300 again in the next 5 years or less. Go for it now!!!"
"Zack's just put out a pretty good read. Answered my buyback question as well ...In the fiscal second quarter, Skyworks paid out $83 million as dividends. The company has temporarily suspended share repurchase program to compensate for the recently announced acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Laboratories (SLAB)."
"Fantastic numbers, great guidance and the dividend upped 14% to $0.50 a quarter. Amazing..!"

Growth is off the charts for this company. Any price under $200 is a gift
SBQ - No I didn't buy at 190. I have held this stock for over 10 years. It's a has been very frustrating the last 6 months watching this stock languishing between 170 - 190 when others like AMBA and SYNA and NXPI have been moving.The biggest concern for everyone holding this stock is if SWKS loses Apple as a customer. If this happens game over.
This reversal should put SWKS in a $5 trading range before it's next breakout upwards prior to it's May 3 earnings report. My target goal for the breakout is from $220-$230. GLTA
Amazing opportunity to buy here based on an overreaction to inflation fears. Semiconductor manufacturing companies like QRVO and SWKS are on the verge of experiencing record growth. Semiconductor manufactures (and even more so) semiconductor equipment companies are in a very unique position in the market/economy/world right now. Nothing but unprecedented growth and record earnings ahead.
This seems to be the trend in tech earnings. No beat is big enough. The stock is already off well over 10% from the high. Valuation is a bit rich by historical standards but that's because of the 5 year duration of the 5G cycle. I haven't had a chance to look at guidance yet but I suspect the stock would be down a great deal if it had disappointed. I'd say steady as she goes. If tech recovers (the QQQ's are below their 50 dma) SWKS will bounce along with it.
So painful watching Nancy speak. Almost as painful as watching Slo Joe speak. It's time they are put out to pasture. It would be humane! That's where thoroughbreds go.
I thought this was a big 5G? The last 6 months it’s down 2%
lots of content in the iPhone 13.
And yes it did close under $160. The stock that never fails to disappoint.
"SLAB's I & A division, which SWKS just purchased.""Second Quarter Financial Highlights:I&A revenue from discontinued operations increased to $108 million, up 11 percent sequentially and 16 percent year-on-year."""
getting that 50 cent dividend today is bringing it down $1.58. A lot of good a dividend does me!
"As I was saying, AVGO may be looking to unload their RF wireless. Their ER CC was very weird in avoiding to talk and answer questions on wireless.

Closer to $150 than $200. This stock is a joke.
"With Apple's great earnings today, SWKS should head toward $100 over the next few days, no problem.I have shares of both."

"breaking after the bell: Rosenblatt starts Skyworks with Buy rating, $160 price targetRosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy initiated coverage of Skyworks Solutions with a Buy rating and $160 price target. The company is well positioned to benefit from the increasing radio frequency front-end content in 5G enabled devices, Cassidy tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees Skyworks posting above semiconductor industry revenue growth of 10% over the next two years. Improving profitability, a ""pristine"" balance sheet and ""shareholder friendly policy"" makes Skyworks an attractive Buy, says Cassidy."
"On January 21, SKWS will once again report a blowout quarter, and on the conference call, they’ll be asked a question about Apple potentially pulling their business, and they’ll once again say that they don’t have a reason to believe they will, and we will surpass the previous 52wk High. Qualcomm has nothing to do with Skyworks."
SWKS is a certified $200 stock. Look at future earnings and a rock sold balance sheet!!

SWKS is buying BB for $18.50 ??
"Create a 1 year chart with this dumpster fire, avgo, amba, sox, nxpi, syna, qrvo. This stock is dead last. What a disaster this stock is. Never moves. Been in the 170's and 180's for six months. Hasn't reached 190's 200's and stayed there in over six months. What will move this stock?"

Someone downgraded today on secular slowdown what ever that means
"Bmycadi, still with your GUARANTEE that this stock will be over $200 by end of year?"
"I had a question for the long Skyworks investors: don’t you fear the collab with Apple as they have 76% part in the revenues? Apple is known as the company that copies the technologies and runs away, startng to make its own chips etc (look at Intel). What are your thoughts on this? I absolutely believe that the stock will do great in coming months/year, that’s why this question is for the real long positions!"
"The ability for OEM's to manufacture wholly operational devices is going to mitigate growth for suppliers for the next couple of quarters. That, IMO, is why the semis are getting smacked. Every OEM has more than just SWKS silicon in them. SWKS might not have a hard time manufacturing, but they very well, like most other suppliers, have a more difficult time placing their chips. Next year at this time it's probably an irrelevant issue, but as long as there is a chip shortage it's going to have a negative impact on the semis due to temporary lowered forward guidance. Hopefully a lot of the damage has been done"
Hope we have a good day here today
"Three weeks away from earnings release. Anyone care to guess if they beat on revenue, earnings or raise future guidance? Would be interested to hear your thoughts Lawrence, DDule etc."
"Putting the IA buy into perspective. I've posted before about the very lengthy payback period of this buy. This time, attempting to put it into terms of actual value.Paid $2.75B, which cost each shareholder nearly $17 per share (165.14 million shares). Purchase contributes about 70 million in after tax earnings, net of estimated interest costs (400 mil revenue, 40% profit margin, 30% assumed tax rate and 4% interest cost). That's about .42 per share. Applying the current PE of 17.5 and that should add nearly $7.5 per share to the value of the stock.Is the purchase accretive to earnings? Yes. But it would have to be unless the division loses money or was earning less than the cost of debt to fund the acquisition, since no shares were issued. But being accretive to earnings is hardly proof of the value of an acquisition.They paid nearly $17 per SWKS share for something that adds $7.41 per share in stock value. SWKS would have to trade at a PE of nearly 40 to make the IA earnings reflect the value they paid for that acquisition (based upon estimated earnings).Long term, this might be a great investment. But in the short term, it's easy to understand why this is a drag on the stock price. I've owned SWKS for nearly a decade, so I've done very well with it. However, I'm not going to let that interfere with honest analysis of this acquisition. They most certainly paid a very steep price. Unfortunately, I doubt we're ever provided enough detailed information to determine whether the assets acquired were worthy of the premium paid since management stated they won't provide separate operating info for that segment. I hope the BOD is paying attention and holding management to account."
"forward p/e of 16? VERY UNDERVALUED! All the tech stocks are flying with p/e ratios in the 100s, even 1000 sometimes. Should I buy even more ?"
make a great mistake yesterday put in an order which I taught was for SWKS but used SKLS symbolwhat a surprise
"Cost basis for me is $6.52. Purchased in May of 2005. Now it's ""House Money"" for me. Dividends keep piling up & the rich get richer."
I sold at 195 and 175 was my repurchase target price but its falling too fast. Volume spiked up today too. I'm not touching this. Yeah the whole sector is down today but QRVO and SWKS are leaders downward
Great purchase by SWKS of SLAB's auto and infrastructure biz. Just what they needed to diversify their product offerings.
Do your research. It's Qualcomm that has a problem with Apple not skyworks! I'm buying as much as I can at this price level.
Don't buy here. SWKS leading the sector down and its low p/e is telling you something. I know we're all conditioned to think a low p/e is excellent but sometimes that's the street telling you their forecast is too optimistic. It's doing much worse than semis that are directly hit by the Apple news like AVGO and TXN
