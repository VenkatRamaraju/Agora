"Congratulations to bondholders who held back. :)NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Revlon, Inc. (NYSE: REV) announced today the final results and expiration of its previously-announced exchange offer and consent solicitation (the “Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation”) by Revlon Consumer Products Corporation, its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary (the “Company”) that was made pursuant to the amended and restated offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement (the “Offering Memorandum”), dated October 23, 2020. The Company had offered to exchange any and all its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Notes”) issued pursuant to that certain indenture, dated February 8, 2013 (as amended, supplemented, or modified), by and among the Company, the guarantor parties thereto and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”), for (i) the cash consideration or (ii) the Mixed Consideration, in each case as described in the Amended and Restated Offering Memorandum.As of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 (the “ Expiration Time”), approximately $236 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or approximately 68.8% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such series of Notes) had been validly tendered into the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation and not withdrawn.The Company has determined that all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation have been satisfied, and acceptance and settlement is expected to occur on Friday, November 13, 2020 (the “Settlement Date”), assuming that all conditions precedent continue to be satisfied as of that time. On the Settlement Date, the Company will enter into a supplemental indenture to the Indenture to adopt the Proposed Amendments (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) which would eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default provisions. As a result, the Company does not expect that any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding will be necessary.Once the Settlement Date occurs, the Company expects to give irrevocable notice under the Indenture that it will optionally redeem, on December 14, 2020, the remaining approximately $106.8 million aggregate principal amount of Notes not tendered into the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation at a price equal to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, together with interest accrued on such Notes to, but excluding, the date of redemption, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. As a result of such notice and the irrevocable deposit of funds with the Indenture trustee sufficient to effect such redemption, the Notes and the Indenture will be considered discharged in full effective as of November 13, 2020.Debra Perelman, Revlon's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We are pleased by the favorable response to the Exchange Offer, and we look forward to closing it on Friday. This represents an important step towards strengthening our capital structure and better positions us to focus on our future growth. While we still have challenges to face – namely the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic – we believe that we have the right strategy in place and will continue to execute against it.”"
Going back to 20... soon

"Moving averages are rising, according to stoxline. A break of 25.88 could move it up to 30.23."
"(Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. has sold loans secured by three of Ron Perelman’s Manhattan properties at a roughly 40% discount, according to people familiar with the matter.The loans, which were in default with a balance of $193 million, sold for $115 million, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private."
I should have bought more lol
Anyone own Revlon bonds? One is trading around 40 cents on the dollar
"So my dad told me that the stock market is a legal form of gambling that he could support me doing, but told me not to put any money in unless I have a minimum of 5-10k.

Insiders buying share and REV is up 21% todayhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/insider-buys-week-dish-network-111008554.html
"Just a thought, but this company has a short position equal to 35% of float. Maybe a slight short panic."
Short % is down 4% in the last session. I think there will be more pressure on the shorts today due to this Reddit phenomenon. Not sure how long it will last but along for the ride. I’ve been long on REV. I believe in Perelman the brands and the company restructuring. Bullish on fragrance and cosmetics for the next several quarters and think we are in for a good earnings report in February.
no dividend to support the price. I will sell a little of my coty to buy some of this. Cosmetics are a good business to be in all the time. Women still want to look fine in a recession.

"I guess the day traders have left in droves and the few that were caught off- guard by the drop during after-hours yesterday and pre-market today, just wanted to protect their profits and move on.I will most likely be holding until Q4 (2020 full-year) conference call in February 2021 or until my target price of around $15 is achieved, whichever comes first."

"IMO Entry point is right now. I believe that the call will be a positive one and only up from there. Hair, nail and skin were stay at home categories- Rev has them all. Additionally, I think Elizabeth Arden will show greater profit contribution. Makeup category is down 18%. Rev needs to show that they are on par with industry average. Indications that they will be in a much better financial position after the bond swap."

Revlon bonds due 2/15/21 (CUSIP 761519BD8) have drifted down to about 30 ($29.938) This implies the exchange offer will fail. Also likely implies Revlon will go BK to squelch their Debt and wipe out stock holders. Sad :-(
"Revelon revised their tender offer and extended the due date (to 11/5/20). The revised tender has the same terms ($325 per bond) for retail holders OR, for Institutional Investors, $250 plus prorata share participation in 2 debts of $50M and $75M - ABL Filo loan and BrandCo loan - IF the holder is a Qualified Institutional Buyer. So the retail holder gets the same as the previous offer and the institutional Investors (the BIG buyers) get some cash less mthan before and a fraction of a loan sweetener.These bonds (CUSIP - 5.75% Senior notes due 2/15/21) closed Friday 10/23/20 at $27.25 - down from the $32.50 previous sell price. Thus, as compared to the earlier tender offer, the retail holders are unlikely to accept the tender, Institutional holders are bidding DOWN the new tender, and Revlon will go likely go into Bankruptcy - probably a prepackaged BK that has already been negotiated."

With respect to the exchange: QIB's (Qualified Institutional Buyers) and IAI (Institutional Accredited Investors - collectively the BIG DUDES - receive Mixed Consideration of $612.50 per bond. Apparently the Perlmans\'s like BIG DUDES better than they like retail investors. Sucks. I will decline unless they sweeten the retail investors pot. :-(
Wow no activity on this boardWonder why it trades so few sharesNow BK behind and economy improving due to vaccine coming this seems to be to beat down to much??
REV reached a 52 Week low at 10.69
Fake proxy statement. Is Perlman willing to see a BK and losing his stake at the company? This was probably one of the most expensive and wasteful activities by the book keepers for a few bucks. Ends up wasting everyone's time.
I bought 830 shares this morning!! Let’s squeeze!!!
"Long-term investors need to learn how traders affect the stock price. This is all PumpL0rdz sort of stuff. If you invested in this dog, use the parachute and walk away before this goes to 0."
Pleased with the earnings release. A new Rev is emerging on the other side of this.
"If Revlon had spent half the dollars on loan repayment & stock buy-backs as they have spent on the books and books of bond exchange literature literature, Priority Mail ... AND ... attorneys, we would all be closer to whole by now. What a waste."
Anybody watch 60 Minutes Sunday. Fingernail art is booming guess who owns the shops that do this art..yep Revlon..check it out..
"While this has been gut wrenching to watch, I remain long and positive because Perelman is an 87% shareholder."
"Problem is that after years of mismanagement, their various brands has lost their relevance, therefor they will be structurally unprofitable going forward. Not to mention, Nobody is going to buy their overpriced $10 lipstick, if they can buy similar Kirkland's branded lipstick from Costco, at the bulk price of 1/5."
@Ray - Perelman is checking out and going pure cash on business and personal assets. I can not agree with you this time ! Best of luck....
Has anyone received bond payment ?

Revlon retain bond due 2/15/21 are selling now at $54.3. I think the exchange will be accepted by the institutional holders who will be paid about $700 per bond and the remaining unexchanged bonds will pay full at maturity in February of next year.
There were no shockers in the ER and the after hours activity is proving this. Color cosmetics and fragrance are a challenge for the entire industry. I remain long for the following reasons:1. Perelman remains one of the greatest business minds 2. He owns 87% of the shares 3. The parts are greater than the whole and actively looking to offload brands that make sense to further lower debt4. Company now has no debt maturities until 2024 so it has time to execute plans5. Has shown a remarkable ability to pivot during the downturn and drastically adjusted operating costs6. Their mass market portfolio and price points play well in challenging economic times
"Revlon is up just like AMC madness after hoursRon owns 87% float, very easy to control price , i don't have a crystal ball but looks like monster short squeeze is coming $40 Mittleman Brothers price target is explained in their letter to shareholders last yearthey own 1788251 shares, likely more now .If there is no sellers, price will shoot up fairly quickAny one owning shares do not let shorts have it, let's ride it up!,"

Good sign. Still shorting by big hedge funds. It mean it will go up. Earnings are also on the way.
REV is down -7.73% to 16.70
"Finally, the mother of all short squeezes has entered it's early phase :-D"
"Better results today, making progress."
"Perelman might be a 87% owner however, he is selling assets left and right for a reason. What's Revlon's book value per share? A negative 27 bucks a share? If the shorts weren't covering a couple shares here and there, would probably be nobody on the buy at all. I'll think about buying in the 2's . I do wish luck to the longs that have been holding."

"Revlon products contain high levels of PFAS!Use of PFAS in cosmetics ‘widespread,’ new study findsMany cosmetics sold in the United States and Canada likely contain high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a potentially toxic class of chemicals linked to a number of serious health conditions, according to new research from the University of Notre Dame.Scientists tested more than 200 cosmetics including concealers, foundations, eye and eyebrow products and various lip products. According to the study, 56 percent of foundations and eye products, 48 percent of lip products and 47 percent of mascaras tested were found to contain high levels of fluorine, which is an indicator of PFAS use in the product. The study was recently published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology Letters.https://news.nd.edu/news/use-of-pfas-in-cosmetics-widespread-new-study-finds/A total of 231 cosmetics were purchased or obtained as free samples for analysis.

"The thing I love about Lowes is this is an obvious pair trade that will pay off 100%. Right now you had HD sell off and Lowes continued to ramp. Lowes was already extended in comparison to HD.

$C $REVThe judge should throw this $900M error case out and force Revlon to return the monies. This is such a waste of time. The bank made an obvious error. Revlon knows it was an error. This is childish behavior by Revlon and an embarrassment to both parties - especially Revlon. Revlon's actions are akin to stealing in my book. Revlon has no ethics. Do what is right.

"So the standstill agreement got extended today which obviates a near term short squeeze. I wonder if Mittleman Bros. were responsible for all the buying today, or if Perelman celebrated the extension by buying even more."
Now is a good point to start shorting.

Perelman can have my shares for $35 a piece
"Ronnie's Deal of the Month.. Should I take the $325 vs $1,000 or wait until Bankruptcy ?October 26, 2020Dear Noteholder:Bondholder records indicate that you are a holder of Revlon Consumer Products Corporation’s (“RCPC” and together with Revlon, Inc., the “Company”) 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Notes”). To deal with this upcoming maturity, Revlon is offering to exchange your Notes for cash. We are sending this letter, together with a new offering book in connection with our extension of the deadlines relating to the offer to exchange your Notes.For each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered, you will receive $325 in cash if you tender your Notes at or before 11:59 p.m. New York City time on November 5, 2020 (the “Early Tender Deadline”).If you tender your Notes after the Early Tender Deadline, but before 11:59 p.m. New York City time on November 10, 2020 (the “Expiration Time”), you will receive $275 in cash for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered. As you may have heard, the Company has been dealing as best it can with a difficult business environment, particularly in the face of the ongoing and prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, which is putting a strain on the Company’s cash resources and liquidity. Under the Company’s credit agreements, if a large portion of the 5.75% Notes remain outstanding after November 15, 2020, most of the Company’s debt will accelerate and become payable on that date.Therefore, if you do not act now to participate in the Company’s pending exchange offer, repayment of your Notes will be at risk."
Citi called...they want their money back

One thing I can tell you with certainty is that women across the world will always buy beauty products. Revlon has always adapted over the years and will do so again.
REV will not survive this crisis. Poorly run and this is a nail in their coffin.

"Awesome quarterly results. Look at the profit compared to 2019- an excellent demonstration of financial discipline. Sales of EA and fragrance have exceeded 2019. Given that we are not out of the global pandemic yet, these results are just outstanding! Great job to Debbie and the team!REV long "

COTY is also a good buy.
Another 20% after hours? How is this possible....
"Just listened to the earnings call. I’m very happy with the progress, especially the growth in E Commerce - And furthermore the Current quarter is surpassing expectations. Also more bullish than ever with the EA acquisition and it’s contribution- it is a leading global skincare brand with leading franchises. The short term financial angst its debt created is ensuring the long term success of the company. My prediction is that we hear about the offloading of brands in the near future along with retail traffic picking back up. The SP will be back to Pre COVID soon."
Very pleased with the Q1 results. As we near the end of global lockdowns a much stronger and disciplined Revlon has emerged. ￼Elizabeth Arden performance was very impressive and proves that the strategic acquisition of that brand was a great move.Long Rev!! 
REV is up 6.44% to 17.35
I meant GME not AMC
I keep adding. With the rise in fragrance and cosmetics It’s about to pop off. Rev has not had a pretty history but I have no doubt that it is behind them now and they rise with the tide. Ron Perelman is a master.
$16 tomorrow.
Bond prices edging up. Stock prices raising substantially. Exchange offer extended with a price of $325 for retail holders and $750 for institutional holder. And a NEW glossy 4 color two page printed and FedEx delivered flyer announcing the deadline extension. Jeeezzeee. Spend the dollars Perlman. Spend the dollars. Don't protect the current and existing stock & bond holders. A god forbid you sweeten the offer to existing retail bond holder.Forget the success of the exchange unless you have complete control of the institutionally bond holders.
is revlon going bankrupt?
great. keep going . worth 14$ for my opinion

"Take your profits while you still can This likely won't just drop like a rock, that is without news, but will be a slow bleed back to $4. Whether it hits $8 and jumps to $10, or drops to $6 and jumps to $8.5 or $4 to $6. This is going back to $4 and then lower. It will bounce again at some point, who know where $2, $1. Likely can get back to $4. Learn how stocks trade, it takes a long time for every bagholder to capitulate on their own terms. The hardest thing for a human to do is cut their losses. However, mark my word, this stock is going bankrupt.6x Debt-to-EBITDA is the gold standard line in the sand between bankrupt and borderline bankrupt. REV is well in excess of that. Want a different bankruptcy metric??? Rev has a Z-score of of -.52. Anything less than 1.81 is toast."

"With all the negative talk about Revlon and the price decline, it may be time to buy a share or two. Seems whenever they pick up a new celebrity spokes person, sales improve. Did anyone say Britney Spears? Did the Wall Street Boys get you to sell all your shares? Yes, I have once again bought a couple of shares. "
I wonder how they were putting us at harm. Any serious thoughts (lawyer) to give them a lesson

"It's looking like Revlon is trying to do away with the default provisions. Is that what news releases talk about when they said November 16 deadline?Revlon Announces Amendment and Extension of Exchange Offer and Concurrent Consent SolicitationOct 23, 2020NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)In conjunction with the Exchange Offer, the Company is soliciting consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) to effectuate proposed amendments, which will eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default provisions from the Indenture. Holders who tender their Notes in the Exchange Offer must also, and will be deemed to, deliver their consents with respect to such Notes pursuant to the Consent Solicitation.As amended, the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is no longer subject to the condition precedent that a minimum of 95% of all aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding be tendered in the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is now subject to a new condition precedent that the Company’s As-Adjusted Liquidity (as defined below) is not less than $175,000,000 plus the aggregate principal amount of Notes (together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon) outstanding after completion of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation. All other conditions precedent remain unchanged, as more fully set forth in the Amended and Restated Offering Memorandum."
any news that this one is up 19%?
"@George I agree. Perelman's troubles don't stop at REV... He's losing money at all his businesses. If he were going to bail out REV, he would have already have done it. Maybe someone will pick up Elizabeth Arden, arguably it's most valuable asset."
"Hi, not sure but isn't Fabian leaving a good thing?"

"Buy COTY guys, still extremely undervalued. The company is profitable. You can double current price the next few months."
Mmm..bankruptcy off the table..earnings not so bad...vaccine rolling out...smells like a buyWomen amd some men need makeup
REV it’s in top 15 in shorted stock. I think it will move big time.
Revlon is up 12.39% to 11.61
When is the earnings ? Today?
Ronnie's assets will be down to $2B very soon.
"If any of you holding REV stock can read a balance sheet, you will see that the equity is worthless. Go back to school and learn how to read financial statements."
REV is down 8.26% to 19.89

Buy COTY guys. Still extremely undervalued with huge potential upside.
"Pull out your recession playbook- cosmetics are a consumers cheap thrill during hard times. None of these competing online boutique brands can compete with rev on price and the last time I checked, we had an awfully huge number of unemployed. Anyhow- We live in a disposable culture. Use it a few times and try something new. A $5 lipstick or nail polish is an easy purchase decision."
"Restructure all they want, at the end of day, it will be a takeover, like Delta, Citicorp, ...Go, Go, Go."
"With AMZN opening up a new channel for beauty industry professional supply, wouldn’t brands such as REV who already serve this channel through other retailers benefit from this? I can see the competing retailers such as Sally SBH getting hammered on this news but why REV? Would love to hear your thoughts."
REV accidentally got paid $900 Million from Citigroup and a judge just ruled they get to keep it!!!!
"Additional staff cuts, furloughs and working hour reductions announced internally by 'CEO'. Not a pretty picture for REV's future after we get through the Pandemic."
"Revlon has again made an exchange offer for their bonds. A Yahoo summary say: ""Investors who act by October 13 will get $275 in cash, plus a $50 early tender fee, for every $1,000 of bonds they turn in. Certain institutional holders can receive as much as $250 in cash, plus $145 of term loans and $217.50 of new second-lien notes. The plan also calls for wiping out substantially all the restrictive covenants and certain default provisions on the notes.The infrequently traded 2021 bonds were quoted at 32.5 cents on the dollar on Sept. 22.""This exchange is NOT restricted to qualified investors (BIG dollar guys) and returns about $37.50 per bond. It is not clear to me if the 2024 bonds (cusip 761519BF3) are included in the offer but I don't think so because of the trade price for the bonds (about $14).The question remains IF this exchange offer will bring retail bond holders to the exchange table. It IS a bad haircut."
Finally a somewhat decent report.Shorts must be covering.

"From the SEC filing on October 23, it seems even with the missing $90m bondholders, the exchange offer is going to pass because REV has ample liquidity even if these bondholders are a no show but I expect another extension tomorrow just to play safe.Modifications to Conditions PrecedentProducts Corporation has eliminated the condition precedent to the completion of the Exchange Offer that a minimum of 95% of all aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding be tendered in the Exchange Offer.Products Corporation has included a new condition to the completion of the Exchange Offer that Products Corporation’s As-Adjusted Liquidity (as defined below) be not less than $175,000,000 plus the aggregate principal amount of Notes (together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon) outstanding after completion of the Exchange Offer.The Company’s “As-Adjusted Liquidity” is defined as: (1) unrestricted cash (including cash generated from operations) after completion of the Exchange Offer, plus (2) “Excess Availability” under the Amended Credit Agreement after completion of the Exchange Offer, less (3) accrued and unpaid transaction-related professional fees.As of October 16, 2020, the Company’s As-Adjusted Liquidity was a total of approximately $308 million, consisting of: (1) $267 million of unrestricted cash (not reflecting any cash generated from operations or any other items that might arise after such date), plus (2) $57 million of “Excess Availability” under the Amended Credit Agreement (not giving effect to an $85 million availability block currently in effect that will terminate as of the date of completion of the Exchange Offer and not reflecting any reserves or other adjustments to the Borrowing Base thereunder that may be imposed by the lenders prior to the settlement date of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation), less (3) approximately $16 million of accrued and unpaid transaction-related professional fees.All other conditions precedent remain unchanged."
So quiet 
The walstreetbet fellas should get cracking on this one. 26% is a grand opportunity for a company with this kind of historical success.
"On the 24th, expect short interest data as at the 13th to be over 100% of the 6m float.Retail Investors hold a maximum of 1m shares I suspect. From simplywallstreet:General Public 0.7% -- why short REV now? It's a little too late for that.

"Caraher said he was approached in April by representatives of Perelman’s investment firm, MacAndrews & Forbes, with an offer to pay off Revlon debt his firm was holding. In exchange, Symphony would support a restructuring Revlon was trying to complete. When he asked where the money was going to come from, he was told that MacAndrews & Forbes would “take care of it,” which Caraher said he took as an indication it would come from Perelman.Bloomberg article"
looks like ulta beauty making a move to buy them out
"It strikes me that the exchange offer will fail (needs 95% acceptance), Revlon will not make the 2/15/21 maturity payment, many remaining bonds will become fully due & payable by covenents and Revlon will be forced to declare bankruptcy. Sad."
REV is down -5.15% to 21.20
REV reached a new 52 Week High at $27.15
