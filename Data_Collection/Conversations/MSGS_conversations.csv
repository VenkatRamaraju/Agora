"They are starting to let fans back into the arena so I expect this stock to do well, hopefully getting back to what it used to be"
“Holy smokes I’m caught short msgs” said no one ever.
Braves stock up 7% today...why can't we ever get 7% up day?
"Yesterday I attended the Dolan family reunion – er, shareholder meeting. Today I sold my shares. I came away convinced the Dolans don't see ordinary shareholders as partners and that those who have doubts about the Sphere projects may well be right. There weren't many regular shareholders on hand – the company didn't make it easy to attend, requiring a ""ticket"" in advance – and two of the few questions were softballs (one from a guy inexplicably wearing a MAGA hat and another from a boy who might've been 10). But one guy did challenge CEO Dolan's pay package, noting that results have been disappointing. ""You just don't understand options,"" Dolan responded. I think it's more likely Dolan doesn't understand optics."
$5.8 billion valuation by Forbes for the Knicks alone and this stock still can't move up. Dolan discount! PLEASE SELL!
"No NBA, no NHL, no Concerts, no Theatre, lots of Debt, assets are in Los Angeles and New York City, and no income.......Stock up 12%??"
up 10% tomorrow?
"Does anyone think this stock will hit 200 by may, I’ve had two calls for that"
I was wrong about up 10% after earning. Going up 30%!!!!!! Someone keeps buying this everyday since earning.
Madison Square Garden Sports is up 4.96% to 172.77
Knicks and Rangers are both playoff teams. Attendance will be back to normal this season. Big things ahead!!
knicks > nets imo 
im Buying now
This stock is my pick to click if youre looking for value..It cant really go down much but can go to 200 a share...The Knicks and Rangers combined are like worth 7 billion and this is 3.5 billion market cap. Soon Delta should peak and every game will be sold out this year.
"This still is hugely undervalued when you think the Warriors just sold a small non-controlling stake of the team that value the team at $5.5 billion!!! $5.5 billion! based on today's stock price and subtracting Rangers and all other MSGS assets, Knicks team is only worth $3.5 billion according to the stock market!!!Well under the $5 billion FORBES, Sportico and other firms have Knicks valued atArctos Sports Partners is buying a minority stake in the Golden State Warriors in a deal that values the NBA team at roughly $5.5 billion, according to multiple people familiar with the sale.The private equity firm is buying about five percent of the team, the people said. It is believed to be the first private equity investment in an NBA team since the league loosened its rules to allow institution investors.Arctos was co-founded by private equity veteran Ian Charles and former MSG CEO David “Doc” O’Connor. The firm had about $1 billion in assets under management as of February, capital it planned to use to invest across sports franchises.The Warriors are the second most valuable team in the NBA, according to Sportico’s rankings. The team, which opened a new San Francisco arena in 2019, is worth $5.21 million, according to those numbers.A representative for Arctos declined to comment. A representative for the Warriors declined to comment."
i am ALL IN
"This stock is a no brainer at current valuation if you are looking for less volatility and a stock that has room to expand. Even with Covid the value of sports franchises will not diminish. In the long run the games will be back and there will always be mega-billionaires that want to own real teams, not the fantasy teams and leagues that most people play."
"Someone jinxed this stock 3 days ago.Stock down $10 and Knicks on 3 games losing streak.Everything was going upward, Upgrades, Billionaire Egytians buying 6.3% of the team, etc...then someone had to jinx things"
Its at such a discount that the Dolan's might offer to take it private
