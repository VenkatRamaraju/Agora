"28 DAYS AGO....No words were spoken but a strong thought came to mind to pray the Rosary every day until the election and the TRUMPSTER would win. i've never prayed the Rosary as much as i should have over the years, but i loved the Blessed Mother of JESUS since i rode a tricycle and have only missed Sunday Mass and Holy Communion 3 times in the last 40 years. So, the wife and i prayed the Rosary together before bedtime and 28 days later, the TRUMPSTER won the election. Whether he won it or not, we'll continue to do it because it's just feels good...."

What’s up with this stock
"The sound of silence, not good for MSG"
This stock is my pick to click if youre looking for value..It cant really go down much but can go to 200 a share...The Knicks and Rangers combined are like worth 7 billion and this is 3.5 billion market cap. Soon Delta should peak and every game will be sold out this year.
Sure came down quick from 321What happens from here?
For anyone who is curious to why it is spiking it is because of what Mark Cuban said on cnbc about sports betting
"Does anyone think this stock will hit 200 by may, I’ve had two calls for that"
"i played guard on a lot of good teams back in the day. One season back in one of the Bismarck leagues, i averaged 28 points a game. Our two forwards averaged 20 and 22 points a game. A lot of high school and college players can shoot, but their defense suffers. i loved to play tight defense against the other teams best shooting guard. Many of them fell apart when you're in their face. Their 20 point game fell to around 6. paul ryan is one of those 6 point shooters...."

"Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis told Sportico’s Eben Novy-Williams and Peter Schwartz during Tuesday’s event that down the line, NBA teams should be worth significantly more money than they are today. “When you look at how big the [potential] marketplace is, [the NBA is] still a small business,” Leonsis said. “When you think about [there being] 8 billion people around the world, 6 billion now connected with high-speed connections [there are many potential fans out there]. Our cable ratings—even though we’re pretty much the top rated show up and down the line nightly—are still small” from a penetration standpoint. The league, he said, still has “a lot of upside.”– via Sportico"

"Yesterday I attended the Dolan family reunion – er, shareholder meeting. Today I sold my shares. I came away convinced the Dolans don't see ordinary shareholders as partners and that those who have doubts about the Sphere projects may well be right. There weren't many regular shareholders on hand – the company didn't make it easy to attend, requiring a ""ticket"" in advance – and two of the few questions were softballs (one from a guy inexplicably wearing a MAGA hat and another from a boy who might've been 10). But one guy did challenge CEO Dolan's pay package, noting that results have been disappointing. ""You just don't understand options,"" Dolan responded. I think it's more likely Dolan doesn't understand optics."

"This stock is a no brainer at current valuation if you are looking for less volatility and a stock that has room to expand. Even with Covid the value of sports franchises will not diminish. In the long run the games will be back and there will always be mega-billionaires that want to own real teams, not the fantasy teams and leagues that most people play."

"Based on my calculations, this stock is fairly valued at $110. I expect that the dividend will be suspended. The additional debt in 2018 and the likelihood that ROIC will be below par means that an investor can get an attractive return on investment of 10% at $110. Obviously anything less is a discount but could imply bigger risk."

"Timing is EVERYTHING, most of the time....i think there were 8 teams in our league. Our team and one other were undefeated, so we were going to play for the title the following week, which didn't mean spit to anyone but us. The other team had a good shooting guard, but there was no way they were going to beat us. i was drafted by the Army, but wanted to see California, so i joined the Marine Corps instead and was supposed to leave in two weeks. A couple days later, the recruiter called and said i could go in two days. i thought about the game, but for some reason i said okay. Went through boot camp at MCRD, advanced training and then admin school. After admin school they took about 20 of us and sent us to legal school. They said we could pick our own duty station by the way the way we finished the class. my buddy Elzey and i studied hard and it paid off. A woman Marine came in first and third, but they had to go to San Diego and didn't get to pick their duty station. i came in 2nd and Elzey came in 4th, so we got first picks. Treasure Island needed two legal clerks, so we jumped at that one. i also was the 1000th Marine to graduate from that school, so they gave me another grade. We started there in January 1972 and it was the perfect fit. A young 1st Lt. was the boss, a 40 year old woman Staff Sergeant ran the office and the two of us rookies filled the office. It was an old large house on base and i had walk through the aisle past the Captains office, the Majors office, the lt. Colonels office and past Colonel Mulvihills office (who was one heck of a nice guy) back to our small office in the back of the building. It was a very cool place to work.Private Wilbur was a good buddy and one day it was raining like crazy outside. He walked over to our building for some reason and the flag was being raised. He stopped on the steps and the water was coming off the roof down the back of his shirt, so he stepped on the porch. We all gave each other names, so i gave him the name ""Wilbur"", because he was such a smart guy. He was from Colorado and cut the head off a parking meter or some other terrible crime, so the judge gave him jail time or Marine Corps Time.The Major hated Wilbur, because he didn't take the Corps very seriously, so he wrote him up for office hours, because he moved while the flag was being raised. Wilbur walked into our office all upset and told me about the office hours, so i sat down to that beautiful IBM Selectric typewriter on my desk and typed out a note that Private W. requests Lt. Golub to represent him at office hours ( Lt. Golub was a Naval Lawyer that never lost a case) and told him to give it the Major on the way out. We never heard from the Major again and he did leave Wilbur alone from that day on. It was a great 15 months and i had a 64 Econoline van, so we spent a lot of weekends off base from the Russian River north to Ben Lomand or Glen Lomand (sp.) down south on a Friday night at a large log tavern, that just happened to have Jessie Collin Young and his band that night. We were six feet away from Earthquake Anderson, one heck of a harmonica player. We also took in a lot of concerts at Winterland. The first concert we went to had ZZ Top, a group from England called Wild Turkey and the headliner was Ten Years After. Too many good times to forget.My team lost the game by 6 points without me.....timing is everything...."

"once MSG begins issuing dividends, this stock will be a printing press"
"This is the most recent article on Jimmy Dolan and why us poor shareholders will need to wait for him to sell the team or go away to get this stock to go from $160 to $270.The multi-billion-dollar price tag for the Knicks is a fair market value, based on analysis by Sportico predicated on confidential discussions with NBA experts, officials from various teams and, in the case of the Knicks, public filings. Indeed, one possible objection to that figure comes from the stock market. And Mr. Market seems to claim the Knicks aren’t worth nearly as much.Madison Square Garden Sports is a publicly traded holding company that owns the Knicks and Rangers plus some toss-ins—a couple of G League teams here, an esports franchise and training centers there. (The arena itself is owned by a different company, MSG Entertainment.) The market says MSGS as a whole isn’t even worth $4.4 billion, a value reached by the market cap of the stock at $4.02 billion and $350 million in debt.The seeming incongruity is based on one thing: “Not only does the Dolan family control the company, Jimmy Dolan has a personal veto on the sale of the company,” said G. Research’s Tinker, who covers the stock. While MSGS is listed on the stock market, the Dolan family controls the business through supervoting shares, meaning shareholders are really like limited partners in a traditional private team ownership group. You can go along for the ride, but you’re basically powerless. If someone wants to buy the Knicks, “there’s only one person you’re negotiating with,” Tinker said. “The negative press Jimmy’s had is stunning, but so far he has no inclination to sell it.”Viewing MSG Sports as a limited partner in the Knicks and Rangers suddenly makes the valuation more sensible. It’s not unusual for limited partner stakes in sports teams to trade hands at deep discounts, perhaps as much as 35%, according to multiple sports bankers. That means the $4.4 billion enterprise value of the teams actually reflects a market estimation of the Knicks and Rangers being worth around $6.7 billion. Based on ballpark estimates that the Rangers could fetch as much as $1.5 billion themselves, the Knicks come in at a back-of-the-envelope $5.2 billion. That is not too far off Sportico’s more rigorous valuation, which includes additional Dolan family holdings related to the team.Even then, should the Knicks be put up for sale, market watchers wouldn’t be surprised to see a private buyer pay well more. The pool of potential people willing to pay more than $5 billion for the team is very small, “but there would be two buyers who are serious. That’s all you need,” added Tinker. Like the other handful of analysts who follow MSGS, Tinker has a higher estimate of the company’s value beyond the market’s current price, based in part on hopes one day the Dolans will sell (and in part to the fact the Dolans have been generally good at creating shareholder value.) Shares trade around $166 right now, and Tinker thinks $270 is a reasonable expectation. That’s a 63% premium, valuing the Knicks and Rangers at a combined $7.2 billion."

Knicks expected to receive $167 million in cash from Expansion fee in the next 2 to 5 years. It has since been reported the NBA discussed adding two teams—both of which would come with a $2.5 billion expansion fee that would be distributed among the league’s current group of governors. Silver participated in Sportico’s NBA valuations event on Tuesday. The commissioner was “not ready” to confirm the number of teams or the price point the league would seek if it were to add clubs. He said it “doesn’t feel like the right time” to focus resources or attention on future growth with the league still trying to navigate the pandemic. But Silver did say that “clearly [the] valuations [show] some of the reported numbers [for expansion fees] are very low in terms of the value at which we would expand.”– via Sportico
