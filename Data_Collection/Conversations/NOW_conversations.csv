ServiceNow price target raised to $565 from $525 at Wells FargoWells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow raised the firm's price target on ServiceNow to $565 from $525 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst has forecasted new subscription billings per sales and marketing headcount to normalize to pre-crisis productivity levels by year-end 2021 and ServiceNow to continue adding S&M headcount at a robust rate in the second half of 2020 and well into the future-neither of which he believes are properly reflected in consensus billings estimates.https://thefly.com/n.php?id=3161882

"stocks reporting ER are all down AH: now, ebay, xlnx except ford motor (F) up +5% - no ER plays for me AH this afternoon baby"
Why -10% after market hours ?
"Oh, and BTW, SNP was up last night in AH and ended down $6 today"
Why the price got hammered after market with good results? It doesn’t make any sense at all.
can anyone explain to me why its ok for a stock to have pe above 100 and still get increase ratings? its barely meeting earning expectations yet its still get insane increases.

can't believe this stock is at $665 now it used to be in the $30/share way overpriced

"ServiceNow assumed with a Buy with $670 price target at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan assumed coverage of ServiceNow with a Buy rating and $670 price target. The company stands ""well positioned"" to become an over $15B revenue cloud applications software firm by 2026, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Rangan adds that ServiceNow's operating margins could then hit 30%-35% and free cash flow margins could potentially reach 35%-40% thanks to its ""very efficient"" customer acquisition economics and expansion beyond its core ITSM market into adjacent markets."

"This was my top conviction pick back in May (along with ETSY) I started buying at $464 to $540. Cost basis $511. It has gotten a bit ahead, but I won’t sell. I regret not buying more.

If you too nervous just buy safe divi snoozers PG or CL and that’s OK, there is nothing wrong with that. Don’t Worry!"
