"Why don’t we stop arguing with the same information over and over. Instead, let’s wait for Remi’s announcement regarding A) partnership B) new data results C) stock repurchasing plansAny of the above should create a short squeeze to $300!"
30% up today!
"It is obvious that these creeps will keep on shorting this, because there is so much profit in it. Until the consequences (losses) are greater than the profits it's going to be a bumpy ride, unless of coarse we get some promising news. While waiting, it's not a bad idea for all of us to expend some energy writing letters or initiating petitions to the SEC/CONGRESS to criminalize 'shorting', making it no longer a profitable endeavor."
"Even the Shorts have to admit that when your lawyer is writing to the FDA and quoting people on Twitter, Covid-denying bloggers in Germany and can’t even spell the name of the drug correctly, things are getting a bit desperate, no?"
I highly doubt the FDA would listen to a short seller and deny millions of the only drug that can help them.
"To all SAVA investors. I own AMC and SAVA. I have watched AMC be short attacked since January 2021. There are billions of synthetic shares outstanding so I understand hedge funds doing everything in their power to create FUD, including the employing of hundreds of paid shills to disseminate false and misleading information. I can tell everyone this, if anyone can transform AMC, it is Adam Aron and he has already shown everyone what he is capable of doing and this is why I am invested in AMC.For SAVA, if there is a product that can help to improve the lives of those suffering with Alzheimer's Disease, then lets advance that technology rather than prohibit it from being launched to the market. However, and unfortunately, not everyone is concerned about health but their motive may be 'strictly' financial. I am not here to say that SAVA did not commit wrongdoing as it might be plausible but I am saying that when hedge funds find a weakness in a company, they employ many paid shills to push a narrative and that narrative might not be true. I posted a previous comment clearly showing what would be referred to as a 'bait and switch' in which Pfizer attempts to convince the American people that the current vaccine being injected into unsuspecting 'people' has been approved but the product approved is known as Comirnaty; however, there is no supply for this product. Therefore, we know that corruption does exist but we do not know that this has occurred with SAVA and yet many are now here, on this message thread, trying to convince investors that SAVA is a fraud in order to motivate the masses to sell. I refer to these paid shills as the 'sharks' doing the work for the hedge funds who have bet that SAVA is going down and are attempting to take it down further. There are many who have participated in the SAVA studies. For investors looking to make a decision on whether to invest more, to sell, or to continue holding, do your own research. Do not make your decisions from comments made by some stranger trolling the message thread. Conduct your due diligence and make an informed decision. I will continue holding SAVA until there is proof of their wrongdoing, if that should be the case and I will buy more when it is determined that they may have been the victim of a carefully orchestrated attack by either hedge funds or another pharmaceutical company hoping to protect their 'interests'. from One of the proteins involved is called amyloid, deposits of which form plaques around brain cells."
Let s do a law suit against the short seller who has done the citizen petition!
"Do you think Cassava Sciences are getting the Phase 2, 12 months results reevaluated with someone other than Quanterix Corp before they release them? I can't imagine them releasing any data that Quanterix Corp did any work on. I wonder how long it takes to develop the p-tau data. It's going to be a great GREEN day when they are released."
HF and MM will start the reversal today. Can't make any money if one side is on the sidelines. Like being a bookie for a football game where there is no point spread. Everyone is betting the favorite.
"Cassava really needs to do something. An outlook on the 12-months-results, on a possible partnership(if still valid) or again a statement that they are looking forward to the phase 3 trial, which will confirm their results. Just some reaction from them. Morning markets here in Europe are weak again - the down-trend has to be stopped.What a shame that manipulators and jealous competitors can create such a disaster .I am still convinced that SAVA at the time being is THE treatment for AD ! Hold and Buy !"
"I think people are forgetting that a ton of information was made available and discussed well before these hits were orchestrated in succession. Normally, the scientific community picks everything apart behind the scenes for integrity and peer review purposes, and even right afterward. That this took quite some time and then it happens all at once screams of coordination and malevolence. There is a Schopenhauer quote which fits this scenario; inevitably, truth will remain and be accepted long after attempts to squelch it have finished. Sadly, many of the greats in science had to go through these pains.Time and patience."
Nice that people aren’t phased by the litigation ambulance chasers anymore. Every time one would come out share price would drop. That is no longer the case. Feeling
0 of 42 citizen petitions in the past 3 years have been granted.All 14 western blot claims have been completely refuted through image analysis. Report sent to SAVA.All other bogus claims have been addressed by SAVA. FDA will NEVER halt a phase 3 before it has even started where there are ZERO safety issues.FDA approves based on efficacy and safety. These were not even questioned by this short bashing petition. MOA is not relevant to FDA approval. Dozens of drugs approved without an understanding of MOA…. ever heard of aspirin?
"Dr. Bik has great credibility and her concerns should be taken seriously. She offers a way out using the original data (which is pretty old in some cases and which may not be obtainable). What I find quite objectionable in the original request from the law firm, is that they ask that the current clinical trial of Simufilam be STOPPED. This is appalling. The data in question is about laboratory results, not clinical response. Cassava's data shows a degree of clinical improvement at 9 months. This is unheard of in Alzheimer's disease, and something I never saw over decades as a clinical neurologist. Granted that Alzheimer patients (and all dementia patients) fluctuate from day to day), the response at 9 months is impressive and absolutely must be checked out by a placebo controlled trial of Simufilam (the design of which has just been cleared by the FDA and which is about to enter patients). Actually, I think that Cassava's data is even better than they realize -- https://luysii.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/cassava-sciences-9-month-data-is-probably-better-than-they-realize/ based on my clinical experience with Parkinson's disease. If you want to see just how bad current Alzheimer therapy is, and how little evidence there is for the approval of Biogen's drug have a look at this -- https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/373/6555/624.full.pdf. Certainly it would be in Biogen's interest to stop a trial of an orally available drug which appears to offer some benefit in an open label trial. The trial has been criticized for not being placebo controlled, but all preliminary drug trials are like this. For a concurrent placebo control with which to compare Cassava's results I suggest the following. https://luysii.wordpress.com/2021/08/30/what-controls-should-cassava-sciences-use-for-their-open-label-trial/"
longs win
There is a major flaw with the lawsuit. Majority of the stock price losses is reaction to the lawsuit. It is like setting fire and then claiming damage and insurance money.
Institutions and Funds are starting to understand the agreement reached between SAVA and the FDA back on Aug 24th! And they're also starting to realize that the claim filed seems to be totally bogus!!! The lid is about to come off as volume is heavy as well......shorts that haven't covered and taken their profits will regret when the share price catapults to mid $60s then mid $70s on short notice......SQUEEZE will be fully ON by then!!!
"All nasdqa is going down, except SAVA..don't worry if it does go up too much today...it'll be sonner than later."
Remi writing the press release this morning !!!
“Short sellers are still down about $240 million so far this year”
Just one more day until September. Phase 3 initiation news can drop any time during the next month.
Law firms trying to stop us. Hold for gold 
I hope this is the start of a climb back to where SAVA should be--would like to see the company come out with a press release on these recent attacks on their studies etc--that would re-instill investor confidence
"SAVA reminds me of Moderna, when Moderna first started. It had lots of FUDs, but look at it now.Simufilma performed very consistence in Phase2, and the only drug that improved cognition after 9 months.There was no doubt about that. Yes Eliza Bik did looked that data in latest article and complained why there were 64 patients in the beginning of trial, but there were only 52 plots. But in the comment section as Imran Khan pointed out to her, she should go to US.clinical.gov and found out all information and it clearly listed to why someone dropped out because of ""Non-compliance, failure to following instruction, failure to do follow up,...""SAVA will do great in phase 3!"
"One thing Bulls and Bears can probably agree on is that the market for a truly effective AD therapeutic is stratospheric. It’s hard to even fathom the market size, though I know many valuations exist. Needless to say it’s the Holy Grail of pharma. As SAVA has progressed through trials it has gone from little step child in the darkest part of the corner to the belle of the ball. With that attention comes all sorts of scrutiny. Kind of like when someone runs for President. Suddenly their whole life gets a forensics retrospective review and depending on your angle, you can make someone seem like Charlie Manson or Mother Theresa.If Simufilam is what Bulls like me think it is, we are talking about the biggest pharma cash cow of all time. If simufilam is a dud, then yes, the stock price will drop precipitously. This is pre-revenue biotech. It’s often binary. And it can be extremely lucrative or devastatingly bad for an investor. Sometimes both in the same week lol! And some try to play both sides of course. Only one group is right in the long run. By the way, they used to say the Earth was flat, the steam engine was forever, humans would never take flight, AIDS was a death sentence, and you sent your film to the pharmacy to get it developed. Just saying, you are wrong till you are right. Then you become legend."
"Soumit Roy, a 5 star analyst, with a $215 PPS target.Thanks brother. I trust you!"
bought 500 at 55.
I don’t think it’s insiders or a competitor but rather one or two large hedge funds that tend to pick on vulnerable companies that don’t have large institutional support. They know how to play the game.
It’s so obvious to a majority of investors what a sham that petition is with zero validity. A sham take down by criminals so plain to see. The only positive out of this fiasco is that I brings ALL eyes onto sava from others in the bio-space to show what a clear leader Sava is in AD and the amazing and greatest bio investment opportunity in history. But us Longs already know that!
Over the past couple of trading sessions SAVA has built a bottom in the $51.50 to $52.50 range. After testing this bottom multiple times it has held. Now we are seeking what will likely be the first green day and SAVA's breakout to higher levels. It would not be surprising to see SAVA over $80 by Friday. Buckle up! Let the good times roll!
Up $5k already!
"Disclaimer, I am long SAVA and plan to stay long SAVA. With that out of the way:After spending countless hours reading all literature and opinion pieces on SAVA over the last 5 days, there is overwhelming evidence in support of Remi and SAVA. The last 5 days was simply a short attack to 1) drop the SP so the big boys can take a position (before the new of partnership and 12-month data announced 2) Shorts profiting 3) Anticompetitive actions (as is established practice by big pharma). It'd be unfair if I didn't point out that some holes have been poked and still need clarification from Remi and his team. With that said, no matter how solid the data holes, will be poked, and will always be poked. Some of the potential holes that stood out to me and my amateur explanations:Elisabeth M Bik is looking into western blot image manipulation by Dr. Wang. She prides herself in exposing fraudulent research. How could that be a bad thing, right? Then why is there a petition against Elisabeth's work with thousands of signatures by fellow scientists? Because she operates as a prosecutor. She ignores reasons why the data has not been manipulated and highlights evidence that points towards manipulation. So the point is Elisabeth believes Dr. Wang is GUILTY until proven innocent. Well, you are the jury, and you should hear out the defendant before forming a conclusion. Specific to her opinions on Dr. Wang, I have some fundamental questions. When Elisabeth asks why the spacing between the bands are irregular, then I want to know exact measurements of the irregularity and what is considered normal (she hasn't publicly stated what those are, and I doubt she knows either). She also failed to mention any other potential explanations, as an unbiased assessment should include.David Vaux, a random Australian Scientist???, has already tried and convicted Dr. Wang. I highly doubt he is open to clarification or even discussed his concerns. IMHO, both of the above ""experts"" are being highly irresponsible, and approach their work without fully understanding context. The ingenuity is morbid, especially when it's masquerading around as good.Quanterix Corp's statement was extremely odd, and unneeded. Labs output raw data and do not interpret or make charts. Their statement is the equivalent of saying water is wet. If anyone knows, Id like to clarify if Quanterix did all the testing after the initial lab messed up the data, or is there a 3rd ""academic lab involved in all this?Lastly, that last scatter plot may need some further clarification. Again, I'd like to reiterate that even if SAVA puts out a 50-page rebuttal, then more questions will be asked, more holes will be poked. At this point, if you're long, then an upcoming partnership announcement and 12-month data should be fruitful, short-term. Long-term, the bottom line is that we have an AD epidemic that could be helped by this medication. It is about to enter highly regulated P3 trials. Over 12 months, there have been no significant safety concerns like death or hospitalization (you can’t hide that). AD treatment data has NEVER looked this promising. If P3 trails go well. Also, there will be interim data, so you dont have to wait 2 years to get an idea of how the trail is going. If the data looks as good as P2b trials, the FDA may consider it unethical to hold treatment from the general population and fast-track it!"
Opening at $80 tomorrow .. FDA Phase 3 study will be announced in press release starting tomorrow Sept. 1 and that the FDA has completely ignore trashed the petition. Shorts Squeeze of epic proportion.
Hedge funds will pivot violently on SAVA coming soon
FDA just confirmed that it’s going ahead with Phase 3 Trials for SAVA! Let’s go!!!!

"On a scientific note. Simufilam is a small molecule, meaning it can be delivered orally and it can diffuse across the blood brain barrier to obtain high concentrations in the brain where it is highly selection for abnormal FLNA which then helps stabilize the downstream cascade of misfolded proteins (such as tau and amyloid) cellular inflammation resulting in cell dysfunction and death. This is novel mechanism of action, highly different from big pharmaceuticals attempt to justify the “amyloid hypothesis” by repeated failed trials using amyloid antibodies (think very large structures) that must be given intravenously and in high concentrations to teach the brain. Sure it can remove amyloid but there’s more going on, and doesn’t correlate with clinical benefits, see BIIB. Also in AlZ patients there is amyloid deposits in the vascular blood vessel walls which weakens the structure and can normally result in a condition called cerebral amyloid angiopathy which increased risk of bleeding. And with Amyloid AB removing more amyloid, which already weakened vascular walls, there’s greater risk of brain hemorrhage, lookup ARIA side effects. I’m a clinical neurologist at an academic university in the Northeast and SAVA long."
"What's in the next complaint letter to the FDA? ""Its not fair you not doing anything about SAVA."" ""I'm going over your head straight to Joe"""
No stock can go down every single day...right? This is really trying my patience and my nerves.....just popped a xanax to keep my blood pressure down.
Nothing negative from FDA Isn’t that what counts?

"MILLIONS $100MM - BY SHORTS DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST ON SAVA - SEE ON BLOOMBERG!!!!!Retail trading favorite Cassava Sciences Inc. has sold off amid concerns over trial data on its Alzheimer’s drug, earning short sellers more than $100 million over the past month, according to data from S3 Partners.The recent moves put the stock at the center of the latest standoff between retail traders and short sellers, which are often hedge funds or institutional firms banking on declines in a stock. Bearish bets have been placed against about 13% of the biotech’s float or roughly $293 million, according to S3.Cassava’s shares took a beating last week after a lawyer backed by a short seller filed a petition to halt trials of the company’s main asset, an experimental Alzheimer’s disease treatment, on concerns over the integrity of the data. Selling accelerated on Friday when Quanterix Corp., the lab Cassava cited as generating the data, distanced itself from the results, saying it hadn’t interpreted them or prepared information presented at a recent industry conference. An analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald on Friday said it was impossible to perform his due diligence and suspended his hold rating on the stock."
"Just bought 6,000 more shares at $54.By statistics in FDA history, Phase 3 will continue. I won’t sell until $1,000"

Clean up the board by muting the shorts!
"I told many hear the ugly about SAVA when no one wanted to hear it. But the story has progressed and its progression has been stunning. The biggest obstacle for SAVA right now is not the science. The science, even for an open-label is fantastic. It is that is it just so good, many think it is too good to be true and are digging up anything they can to satisfy their inherent bias. I try to stay objective and I see no reason not to be buying SAVA at these fire-sale prices. Look how much I am posting. There is a reason for that . . .SAVA: $56.59b"
Typical MO this morning. Plenty of 1 share trades used to drop the price in very light volume.
Hold for glory! 
The Phase 2 open label trial is conducted in 16 centers and management confirmed to us that all statistical analysis is conducted by an outside firm that is unaffiliated with Cassava. Several of the scientific articles brought into questions were published in reputed journals with rigorous peer review process. To be noted that the FDA signed off on the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for both of the Cassava’s pivotal Phase 3 trials in Alzheimer’s disease days after the filing of the Citizen’s PPer JTrading PT maintained at 215$ on FRIDAYYYY! :) same as B RILEYS maintained at 145$

Red painting shortards pre-market on 9.5K volume.
"Look guys. Here are the facts: SAVA improved ADAS Cog11 scores by 3 points AFTER 9 months of treatment. Without a drug effect, ADS Cog11 scores should decrease by 4 points, not improve! After 9 months, the placebo effect is greatly diminishing. And yet Simufilam still improved cognition.And there is more to it. Not only is it improving cognition, but unlike other AD drugs in testing, it is also improving the behaviors of AD patients, backing up the therapeutic value of Simufilam.Many AD drugs have an effect on one or two AD biomarkers, but only Simufilam improves 8-11 of them. No other AD drug does or has EVER had the results of Simufilam. Period. Shorties, complain. The biggest obstacle to you making real money is that Simufilam appears to work so well that it is hard to believe how well it does work. That is the shorts real thesis. It is just too good to be true. But Remi and Sanford and now Mr. Barry say you are wrong and that Simufilam really is producing stunningly strong results.SAVA: $54.13b"
"In the comments to Bik's latest hit piece, Imran Khan exposes her for what she is:""On clinicaltrials.gov, under “study results,” it clearly states how the patients were randomized, how many were included in each group, and why certain patients were excluded (non-compliance, inability to follow directions, lost to follow up, etc.). You’re telling me you don’t know how to look up this data?You showed the same incompetence when you needed to ask for original western blots and information on the compounds. Both were easily and publicly accessible.Using this to insinuate that they haven’t provided this data is irresponsible and reeks of malintent. What’s your motive here? I’ll assume there is an under-the-table payment vs. notoriety vs. plain incompetence. None of those are healthy for your career."""

"SAVA is going for the Gold. Sanford Robertson is heavily invested in time and money with SAVA. And he is extremely successful. And he brought one of his associates onto the board of directors a few months ago. SAVA is powering up. Are you ready? Shorts have played their hand. This is their best. And the $50's seem to be holding. I'm long again. Lot's of good reasons to be confident in SAVA's future. Remi has consistently given us good guidance. And he is excited. I believe we should, too, and the upside is potentially too great for this stock to go down too much, or so it would seem, so thank the shorts for these great prices, again.And remember, they will add to the fire at some point. It is like money in the bank, IF Simufilam continues to prove itself.Lot's of fear and waiting right now. Lows are getting higher and IF Simufilam works as well as some think, this could ONE DAY be a $5,000/share stock (as they expand indications and use the cash to buy more companies).HYPER GROWTH. New large building. Hiering more staff. New BOD recently (a good one. Read up on him if you didn't). Big things are coming. At least that is what Remi is saying. And he has consistently given good guidance.SAVA; $53.27 close"
I live in AZ where patients in both Gilbert and Surprise AZ facility’s had undeniable cognition improvement. There is no way to disprove these results or claim manipulation of results. This attack is criminal and a huge robbery on investors money.
"My letter to the FDA:The FDA has acknowledged receipt of a Citizen's Petition against Cassava Sciences questioning data previously submitted and subsequently reviewed by the FDA. This petition was submitted by a law firm that originally intimated its client was a whistleblower, inferring that the petition was for the benefit of patients. In rebuttal, the law firm noted that its client(s) held short positions in SAVA stock, evidencing a clear conflict of interest, that the petition had in fact nothing to do with patient welfare but rather was focused on making money.I urge the FDA to continue working with Cassava Sciences, continue to support its Phase 3 tests and endpoints and continue to recognize Cassava's efficacy and safety results to date for its AD treatment.Thank you."

"Citizen Petitions are provided for and regulated by Federal law. Historically, most citizen petitions have been filed by drug companies against competing drug companies. However, it is important to understand that the real petitioner that hired the law firm has not been disclosed. IMO, Biogen may have the best reason for asserting this Citizen Petition; but this is just speculation by me. Short sellers and other drug companies may also have a powerful profit motive. I also think the follow on class action litigants may conceivably be in cohoots with those that are filing this Petition. I am not aware of any statutory or tort law that would prohibit the filing of this petition, even though it obviously harms SAVA shareholders; but it would be interesting to hear from any lawyers that have a contrary view.The rules governing an FDA “citizen petition” are set forth in the Title 21 of the Federal Regulations. I have selectively quoted below what I deem to be the key parts of the Federal Regulations for understanding the framework and regulatory process below. I do not represent that these are all the relevant rules or law on the subject and you must do your own DD to decide whether this information is helpful or not.""An interested person may petition the Commissioner to … take or refrain from taking any … form of administrative action."" 21 CFR § 10.25(a). The form of a “Citizen Petition” is specifically set forth in the CFRs. See 21 CFR § 10.30. ""A petition that appears to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 10.20, and, if applicable, § 10.31, will be filed by the Division of Dockets Management, stamped with the date of filing, and assigned a unique docket number."" 21 CFR § 10.30(c). ""The filing of a submission means only that the Division of Dockets Management has identified no technical deficiencies in the submission. The filing of a petition does not mean or imply that it meets all applicable requirements or that it contains reasonable grounds for the action requested or that the action requested is in accordance with law."" 21 CFR § 10.20(d). ""Defamatory, scurrilous, or intemperate matter is to be deleted…"" 21 CFR § 10.20(c)(5).An interested person may submit comments to the Division of Dockets Management on a filed petition, which comments become part of the docket file. The comments are to specify the docket number of the petition and include, if applicable, the verification under § 10.31, and may support or oppose the petition in whole or in part. A request for alternative or different administrative action must be submitted as a separate petition. 21 CFR § 10.30(d).Action that may be taken by the FDA on the petition are set forth in 21 CFR § 10.30(e):""(1) The Commissioner shall, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), rule upon each petition filed under paragraph (c) of this section, taking into consideration (i) available agency resources for the category of subject matter, (ii) the priority assigned to the petition considering both the category of subject matter involved and the overall work of the agency, and (iii) time requirements established by statute.""(2) … the Commissioner shall furnish a response to each petitioner within 180 days of receipt of the petition.

The BIG SHORT SQUUEEEZEE to $120 - $150 is starting NOW !!!! See ya at $150 next week with FDA Full Approval of all SAVA Phase 3 clinical trials.
"It ought to be pretty clear that the FDA knows the shot re 'Citizen Petitions' and that the SPA-approved P3 trials will go ahead as planned. Regardless of whether the brouhaha over biomarkers holds any water, a small company with 11 employees is NOT going to take the time, effort, and money to go back and re-do stuff from 10-15 years ago, or even last month's poster. Simply not gonna happen. Even if arguendo they started this week, it would still take months by which time SAVA will be deep into the P3 trials and perhaps even have selected a BP partner. At that point ancient history won't matter. The only things that matter for the FDA and a prospective partner are safety and two aspects of efficacy: (a) cognition stability or improvement (even a decline rate less than historic placebo beats the brain-bleed Adu option) and (b) AD behavior improvement.BTW, does anybody seriously believe that Dr. Wang, a tenured med school professor, would 'dry-lab' his results? He's not an officer, director, or employee nor a recipient of any stock acc to the latest 10-K and Proxy Statement. So what's his incentive?"
Good to see Sava green
"Look at (fig. 3, bottom row of western blots ""c"" and ""d""). Doesn't it look like GAPDH and Actin are identical??https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/custom-publishing/documents/Western_Blotting_ScienceGE2booklet_MedRes_9june15.pdf"
This will run back to 70 by the weekend and that is without any positive news announced. Except for law firms claiming they have a fraud case (which they don't) you probably won't hear much more negative on Sava for awhile as HF are reversing for now.
"Shorts applying huge pressure to drive it down. Once this turn, its going to jump up $15 or more in minutes."
"You know what’s funny? Whoever has been attacking SAVA will eventually see the opposite result that they wanted. Beforehand, very few people knew of and believed in SAVA, much less their drug on AD. Once all this negativeness blows over, many many more people will know about SAVA and the great safety and cognitive results that their drug has on AD patients. Massive PR has been accomplished this past week. IMO, in the future, the stock should reflect the much higher interest in the company."
"The Wall street mafia behind SAVA crash should be (1) shut down, (2) arrested, (3) thrown into jail without bail, and (4) sued for damages to the shareholders and the company's reputation."
"Assuming any class action suits even approach going the distance (don't forget Remi has a huge warchest, only 40% of which is needed for P3), they'll all be consolidated into one case, as always happens, and it will be adjudicated 2-3 years down the line, by which time P3 reslts will be in."
unbreakable support at 52$ buy now with no fear got my 200 shares at 51.7 and holding strong until 110 free money
"Just reiterating that on Tuesday Aug 24th SAVA confirmed that it ""has"" an agreement with the FDA on special protocol assessments (SPA) for Ph 3. Amongst other things the following 2 facts are stated in that announcement:""..These SPA agreements document that FDA has reviewed and agreed upon the key design features of Cassava Sciences’ Phase 3 study protocols of simufilam for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease....""""About Special Protocol Assessments:A SPA agreement indicates concurrence by the FDA with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints, etc.). These elements are critical to ensure that Cassava Sciences’ planned Phase 3 studies of simufilam in Alzheimer’s disease can be considered adequate and well-controlled studies in support of a future regulatory submission and marketing application. For more information on Special Protocol Assessments, please visit: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/special-protocol-assessment-guidance-industry""....."
smoke is clearing...trials start tomorrow....
"This short seller who made money with his accusation did not file any complaint with the SEC. Therefore, they are not protected by any whistleblower status. Instead, they sent a letter to the FDA asking them to halt P3 clinical trials. This is more evidence that this was an orchestrated short attack."
"With 12 month data expected in mid September, one would expect the stock to establish a decent uptrend from the current level in anticipation? Unless there is an unexpected result, the stock should move substantially higher from here! Added some on this pullback and staying long!"
"When the lawyers say - ""Investors with significant losses"" with Sava - Are they referring to Shorts ?"
Closes over 60.00 today. Easy money here.
"Wow. Big news is coming and Institutions know it. Today’s volume is over $14,604,000 ++ million with the average $5,812,495. They are trying to pull all the stops with the fake lawyer fillings. FDA approved ph 3, NIH reviewed and approved. Partnership deal is being finalized!! Hold."
Cover it !!! It is about the time. And ...........? Hold it !
the 5 Star analyst at Jones Trading. He has a $215 price target on SAVA. That firm is smart and has made me serious coin over the long term. Adding all day! Enjoying these prices.
These same group of law firms have posted on the RKT board relentlessly and repetitively over and over again. It has been going on for several months.
"Folks, I just read another post about the FDA language used in rejecting the shorts position. It looks like the FDA is also sick and tired of these guys and may open the door wide open to a class action law suits against the attorney and his short sellers buddies. I just can't wait for the announcement.Yahoo Message board is simply fraud...."
good news from the company would be perfect right now!
"1.5 million short shares were added between 7/30 and 8/13....for a total of 5.402 million shares short. In my opinion...the taking down of this stock was a carefully planned short. This is not the first time a scenario like this has happened to a biotech in formulative processes. In my opinion...greedy entities saw an easy opportunity, and carried it out."
The lawyers and the shorts are suing on behalf of investors? And they are the reason we lost money? Makes total sense
"Good Entry Point for Cassava Stock, Says Top Analyst - TipRanksMon, August 30, 2021, 10:25 AMFurthermore, just days after the filing of the citizen’s petition, the FDA signed off on the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for both of simufilam’s pivotal Phase 3 trials.So, presented with all the info, what’s an investor to do? Well, for one, Roy thinks a “turnaround in the stock” is in the cards, saying that ahead of the anticipated 4Q21 12-month data readout, investors are presented with a “nice entry point.” Following the positive 9-month readout - which showed a 7-point ADAS-Cog improvement over historic placebo data - Roy expects the data to “maintain high degree of clinical benefits.”In fact, the 5-star analyst says he has not given “any merit to the biomarker data presented so far,” and to reach a “meaningful conclusion” will be looking at the difference in the biomarker levels between 6 and 9 months.“All biomarkers have failed in conclusively predicting clinical benefits in neurodegenerative diseases and broadly speaking, mechanisms of actions of several well adopted drugs are often not well established,” Roy summed up.Accordingly, Roy sticks to a Buy rating for SAVA shares, backed by a $215 price target. Following the big selloff,"
Check the chart a month ago. They knock it down. It goes back up. Hold your shares. Easy double at a minimum.
Short squeeze!
I have been buying small bio companies for 25 years. I do lots of DD and buy companies that are solid but ones that are heavily attacked by shorts after they have some moment. Araid is one example where I made lot of money. But there are numerous. Adam F. & Citron research have been my biggest adversaries. And the law firms always get their post on the boards to scare retail investors. This is just standard practice for the hedge funds / shorts. They are very good at taking SP down and making lots of money. Nothing new under the sun here. But in the end my picks have been winners. I put Sava on my watch list about 2 months ago. And have been waiting for this attack so I could buy shares. P3 is not going to be halted. 12 month data soon. And P3 will prove data to be solid. Add while you can. Hold tight. This to will pass. And you will be making money soon.
Green at the open after 5 sessions were in RED???
Soon we will get to see how many of the short bashers believe the FUD they have been spewing here. Will they still be here as SAVA marches back up to triple digits? Or will they chase the ambulance (big shorting hedgies) to their next victim?
Hey shorts answer the phone it's your brokerage house wanting their Margin Call.
Told you bears not to get too greedy.
$75 by Friday
"The best SAVA news today is from Soumit Roy, the 5 Star analyst at Jones Trading. He has a $215 price target on SAVA and he has a great track record. This is a good entry point. Thank you, Soumit!"
I have followed this stock for the last 9 months.Made and lost a few times.A few observations-I always thought that the price could come down simply because the progress on the research was really just beginning and as with all bio techs like this one-pretty risky.That being said there are now more reasons for me to increase my investment.I unfortunately got caught buying after the progress with the FDA was announced-lost a lot. At this point there are many more reasons to buy than before.1)The drug is moving along in the process with the FDA involved.2)the people that attacked this stock were short sellers-to make it even more obvious they asked for a halt in the FDA examination even though they know that this can't and won't happen because this would only happen if the drug was proven unsafe. 3)This is now a coiled spring-any good news or even a small turn around day and this will see a huge move up by short covering. Hoping those of us who have had patience wit this stock are rewarded and that they really do find a drug that works.
"To every one, if you dont believe in the new drug feel free to sell. If you beleive is the perfect time to BUY. I will not try to convince you, but don' try to convince me either, is my money not yours. Got it !!"
"SAVA will survive and come back stronger than ever before, watch!!!!!!"
Green today is good. Another 5-7% tomorrow would be perfect. No need to be hurry to $100.
Pitstainer muted. Update: Pitstainer2 muted. See how easy that was?
"Want to Play the OddsPlus, Paul Thompson...aka Jordan Thomas has filed 57 petitions with the SEC and only 3 have gone the distance + paid out. And NONE with the FDA, of course.3 for 57 gets you fired in any other occupation."
The main question is why some people/ interests are so anxious to stop the progress of Simulfilam when there are no safety concerns. We all know slick lawyers can drag any organization through the mud. What's at stake here is finding an effective treatment for devastating illness. The merits of Simufilam should be determined by science an phase 3 trial not by litigation by greedy big mouth law firms.
Looks like our friends over at LS have more to add for the FDA to mull over. The accusations of outright fraud are inescapable from this latest document.https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0023
"told you, something gotta give "
"Attention Short Sellers: “Even with the recent selloff, shorts that have been betting against Cassava’s stock for longer have yet to recoup all their losses. Short sellers are still down about $240 million so far this year, according to S3’s Ihor Dusaniwsky.”Keep paying the lawyers to keep the price down. Once there is a partnership, fda approval and the next phase is on its way. Your gonna crumble harder, so sell your positions and take the hit before it gets worse."
Great stock for day trade.
Might see a nice short squeeze this week. I'm selling at 150.
"I like what it says:Jones Trading's analyst Soumit Roy sticks to a Buy rating for SAVA shares, backed by a $215 price target. Following the big selloff, this target puts the upside potential at a whopping 311%. (To watch Roy’s track record, click here)Most of Roy’s colleagues are also undaunted by the allegations. Based on 4 Buys vs. 1 Hold, the stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. Moreover, the $154.80 average price target presents potential one-year share gains of a handsome 195%."
"My father died of neuroinflammation last year. It was very hard to see him suffer like this. In the last week i lost almost 1.5 millions. I bought my share from 2 to 9 and shorts try to scare me .i have got a message for the shorts : it's not just about money, i will sell when the pill will be in hospitals helping people."
Here we go!
"Wish Cassava could/would say something positive today - I am absolutely convinced about SAVA,will hold and buy, but we need some statements until 12 months data or a partnership will be revealed.I cannot imagine that Remi, S. Robertson, Black Rock etc. swallow these insults without doing anything helpful."
"Ways to $200+- Announce the partnership- Huge share buyback to show confidence- A independent 3rd party to verify results/ interpretations- FDA to dismiss petitionAny of these are very possible, can even happen this week...."
"12 month data coming up soon. Open label or not, a good report on that will negate the problems with an Open-label. And at this stage, I would argue that an Open label is better than a placebo-study as it allows more patients to get the drug sooner, and to get more actual early safety data and efficacy data. If it is NOT working, obviously after 9-12 months, the cognitive scores would go down. But they are going up. WAY up. That is exactly the opposite of what one would expect with AD patients. Just to slow down the rate of decline would be a home run. BUT SIMUFILAM IS IMPROVING COGNITION. That isn't supposed to happen AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Can I say it any more clearly?HYPER GROWTH. That is why.SAVA: $53.26 close"
We are riding coattails of the ACIU/Roche announcement on the semi success of their AZ drug which appears to be the same protein that Sava is targeting. This validates their research against the short attack. No?
"For comparison, I Google ""western blot"".I zoomed in on the 1st images.Not only do several lanes look like they could be the same?After zooming some will look like they have a ""box"" or have different appearance around the bands, as if they were ""cut out of another gel""....https://www.labmanager.com/how-it-works/how-western-blotting-works-5163"

"If you are bold enough to stay short at 53, reply and say why."
Reversal today .. going back uo
Phase 3: 750 patients evaluated over 52 weeks and 1083 patients evaluated over 76 weeks. Why do shorts want to stop these trials? Because they know they will provide incontrovertible evidence that Simufilam works.
New article up on SA by Edmund Ingham titled: 'SAVA: 5 Takeaways From The Cassava Sciences / Citizen Petition Debacle' - excellent disussion of the issues and defense of the company
Anyone know how many of the 42 citizen petitions were granted in the past 3 years?
Fda is moving forward with phase 3. Nice!
Partnership coming. He hinted at it already. Hold.
"One announcement from SAVA and this opens at $90 bucks a share. If it is the partnership that the CEO has alluded to before year end, we are talking $140 bucks a share."
"Imagine writing to the FDA and addressing them as “Gentlemen”, misspelling the name of the drug you are screaming about, and then referencing randos on Twitter and anti-Covid German bloggers as your evidence. Yikes!"
So who thinks the rise today is strictly the effect of sentiment or fact?
"Just got filled 10,000 shares at $54 .If you don’t believe, just check the transaction record within the last 2 minutes."
HOLD !! 150$ we are coming 
Can someone provide the evidence of the fda allowing phase 3 to continue?
$75 not out of question if any hint of positive news. Short squeeze could be epic
Higher than 52 today otherwise HFs will just sit and trade back and forth with each other making nothing. Longs are locked in.
Stable recovery over several days - means stronger / longer hands accumulating at value levels
will we see 60 today?
"making knowingly false criminal accusations is a criminal offense. This should be no different, especially when the accuser set out to financially gain from it which they accomplished. Shareholders ought to sue the accuser and the court should certify the class with so many damaged. Then sanction the accuser's lawyer."
"It is curious how one of the shareholder want-a-be class action lawsuit companies quote the 6 month data as being great, and yet omit the 9 month which as even better- maybe WAY better. And what will they say after the 12 month results come out, lol!And what if the CMS study comes out positive. This lawsuit won't last long if the data continues to point the way it has been pointing. And if the data comes in bad, well SAVA was going to fall no matter what. In other words, these lawsuits are more of a fishing expedition and annoyance than anything else. If the results continue to come out FANTASTIC or even way less, this stock is going to g way up. IF the future studies severely disappoint, the stock was going down anyway. So these lawsuits in the longer term mean little to nothing to those who are speculating on SAVA long-term. YES YES YES and Hyper Growth is coming . . .SAVA: $53.26 close"
"From the 8/27 Joe Springer comment on SA: the FDA only halts trials for safety concerns. Simufilam has never had a safety signal in any of its trials, and even had fewer adverse events in treatment groups than an equally sized placebo group in its Phase 2b trial (quite possibly because the drug works well at a low dose without side effects).So while the petition calls for the FDA to ""pause ongoing clinical trials with simufilam immediately pending these investigations"" there is no basis to do so around safety. The FDA has already reviewed all of this data long ago anyway even if it was consequential, and it explicitly recognizes and that there are shenanigans like this being played.Further, the FDA granted Cassava a process called Special Protocol Assessment, and met with them to review Phase 3 designs to ensure they are designed to lead to approval if successful. The FDA in just the last week or so met with Cassava and agreed on trial designs."
"Why hasn’t anyone other than a Covid-denying German blogger who is banned from Twitter confirmed that CUNY is investigating Dr Wang? Couldn’t any reasonable investment journalist confirm this?? My guess is because it’s not true. If that is the best evidence that this FDA petitioner has, good luck convincing FDA."
I haven't sell 1 shares during the red day only avg down
"OK, longs. We are in control, for the most part, now. We break $55 and then $57 and then blastoff? shorts will be thinking of locking in profits . . .SAVA: $54.74"
If it doesn’t go down tomorrow that will be a good sign
"I'm old, but not blind. There is an opportunity here that only comes when the faint of heart falter. I've lived through many a market crash, corrections and reversals and I know first hand where to make the money when bad news happens. It's the old adage, ""Buy on rumors sell on facts"". The huge loss this week is only based on an unproven allegation, not facts. In 12 months this company will once again be on the forefront of AD treatment. If you're scared, sell, and if you're an investor, buy at a discount."
"Do you think 12 month cognition will improve by more than 3.0 over baseline? Up for yes, down for no."
Stock will be up today because the short attack has basically bottomed out. Retail is holding and not selling. MM and HF will reverse gears and move the stock up until its worth it to short it again. Its their world and their game.
"Still not sure why shorts keep this risky #$%$ trade going with the petition being in before the special protocols being signed off. The FDA ignored the petition, and we are ignoring the lawyers. Good luck shorts! You will need it ??"
"Am I the only one that finds it weird that the 2 biggest characters on here, Y and Garp, never ever interact with each other? It’s like they are the same person"
"Call options haven't been that predictive lately, but wow someone bought huge amount of $60's at over $3 premium for this Friday"
i read a post that i really liked today and it should be used accross the board. they said the longs should get a law group and sue the the lawyers and the people who filed the lawsuit with the false info and get all of the long money that was lost -- that should be done to all lawyers who sue represent short hedge funds who manipulte the price down so they can make millions -- it should not be allowed -- of course after it it ---determined that the research is good -- like sava if there are any rich longs on this please do it.
All because of a GREEDY short seller. Good news out anyday now..this goes right to $100 ..with squeeze $ 140.
Look at all the bear spam! That’s fear right there. It’s their blood in the water.
"Sip coffee.. accumulate more..Lift some weights, Accumulate more.. stretch out on the sofa, accumulate more… yawn  See you back over 100 pretty soon"
Common sense 1. Short seller took it down 2.FDA already gave green light 3.There is nothing to lose by doing trial and tons to gain with unmet drug.
"1) The FDA process for examining petitions is public information. They have a timeline for response, information gathering and a judicial process, if it goes that far. First step is for them to accept the petition as legit on premise #1 and #2 for full review (you can look that process up). 2) Grant money cannot be spent on legal fees, and the NIH can and does stop the flow of funds if they have questions. 3) Nobody in their right mind would let the petition just “ride” and wait for the outcome of the FDA accepts it. They will lawyer up aggressively. Even if it turns out in SAVA’s favor, it’s going to cost money, and if the FDA decides to investigate, the average time is 3 years for that process. Meanwhile, all scientific eyes are now in SAVA and their study design, controls & placebos, laboratory methods and statistical analyses are in the spotlight. It doesn’t look good if you judge Remi’s last project with the same trio of Burns (his wife) and Wang. They failed and had to pay out for misleading investors."

Bought 1000 shares of SAVA
Lol Those 19 law firms that are lining up to collect money for the people that lost money on their shares. Are gonna be out of luck in a few days when the shares go back to where they were and there’s no losses to report
Dust is starting to settle. Investors (not day traders) are starting to re-evaluate the data and impending Phase 3 testing. Starting to do their DD on efficacy and 9 month cognitive results. SAVA will make it through this episode and will eventually get its FDA approval. Hundreds of thousands of afflicted AD patients will be helped. The end game is the science and its benefits.
52$ was a good entry point !
"BIIB is providing Aduhelm for ""free"" for some patients because of slow claim reviews by Medicare, according to ReutersNo wonder LLY and BIIB are declining !"

"TakeawayThe Western blot test is a blood test that’s used as a second-step diagnostic tool. If you test positive for HIV or Lyme disease after taking an ELISA test, your doctor may recommend this test to you.There are other antibody/antigen diagnostic tests which give more accurate or faster results. For this reason, the CDC stopped recommending the Western blot test several years ago."
If you suffered a loss in Cassava blablabla
Is there any law firm that will go after those shorts who are stating fiction claim as Cassava described them / him?
Earth shattering news is coming????
SAVA! You can't keep a good stock down.
One thing I don't think has been debated/discussed is the fact that patients IMPROVED!
"major technical reversal incoming today, its on are you ready."
"Elisabeth Bik is becoming the new Adam Feuerstein. I noted with interest her disclosures in her articles on Cassava Sciences:1. ""I do not own any Cassava Sciences stock""COMMENT: by definition, shortsellers borrow stock, they do not own it, and shorting would be the correct way for her to profit from her hit pieces.2. ""I was not paid by any pharmaceutical company or specific person to investigate these allegations, to analyze these papers, or to write this post.""COMMENT: Notice how she is very careful to state that she is not being paid by ""any pharmaceutical company or specific person"" when she could have stated ""I was not paid to write this article."" Revealingly, she DOES NOT STATE that she did not receive pay from investment or financial firms, hedge funds, or law firms.Elisabeth Bik's sudden and coincidental decision to become a fulltime SAVA basher (for free) stinks to high heaven!"
"I miss the days when this board was filled with intelligent long time contributors such as E2W, John, Carl, and Alex."
"How do we know that it's MMs and short sellers? Longs aren't selling, you can see that on the YMB. They walked it down in pre-market trading (where most of you can't do anything about it) by using low share counts and trading back and forth with each other to lower the price. Think about this....It opens at $52.93, over 15,000,000 shares traded and the price went up from open to $53.26. WHY? With that type of volume, the stock would normally go up. But no, the stock stays relatively flat to slightly up from open. WHY? They have no one to buy from! Longs are not selling, so all they can do is trade with each other to keep the price as low as they can get it. Think about it.....it doesn't make sense for the reaction to price and shares...except for shorts! DO NOT SELL!"

"SAVA really simple - either:1. You believe their research is real and after successful phase 3 PPS $500 or2. You believe they have concocted a giant fraud to harm patients, get themselves arrested and the shares are worth $0Best thing for Longs right now is to take a long holiday from here and / or take advantage of the discounted price when it bottoms out."
"so the low die to last week's panic sell was like 49.00, I think this has settled and is now returning to a stabilized position. I'm think 65-75 range and when demand comes in, it'll return to the 100+"

"Let's all read about the whistleblower Jordan Thomas....who admits to willing to do illegal and unethical things (people don't change their true colors ever!) Here is a snipit from his NPR May 29, 2019 interview!And for many years, I wanted to kind of join the family business, for lack of a better way of saying it. I wanted to be a power broker, a string puller, if you will. To be close to him, to earn his love, I was willing to do illegal and unethical things. I'm not proud of it, and I've spent the better part of my life trying to make amends for that."
"Let's be real folks. This drug has little or no adverse reactions so there is no reason for the FDA to halt the drug. Even if some of the data were questionable, there is no reason for this drug to not move on through more vigorous testing. The truth will come out eventually but the FDA is not going to put the brakes on clinical trials at this point. If people were dying from the drug of course they would halt the progress. I see this as nothing but a short attack for financial gain. The dust will settle soon and this stock will be back in the $100's very quickly. The lawsuits against SAVA will then be dismissed because the stock price will be back where it was. The only criminals will be those who brought about these accusations for the sole purpose of shorting this stock."
lets see 60s today!
Ironic that short sellers filed a petition to stop P3 clinical trial claiming manipulation yet that is exactly what they set out to do with this stock price and succeeded. They are the manipulators. SEC should investigate accuser and his lawyer for this scheme.
Can we all agree that cognition is more important than biomarkers?
78K shares trading in very early hours where no retail can trade. pushing down 9%. armies of buy trade volume will come 5 hours later. :)
If this wasn't a short attack and the selling was just due to the news we wouldn't see hundreds of short bashing posts here per hour.
How can Bloomberg call SAVA a meme stock and get away with it?! Anything goes now? Anybody can say anything with absolutely no consequences?
Called the law office that filed the petition left them a message maybe they will get back to me I’ll let y’all know. Everyone should call

Can you stop talking to each other and give us back our board?You all think this is all a fraud and will go back to zero, why keep talking about it? Just short an wait for it to go to zero. Anyone that wanted to sell s out already.Let us know when we can have our board back please..."
"Short-selling of certain stocks is now forbidden in France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. This due to market volatility.No kidding."
"Not giving up are they???If I was a neuroscience medical professional I would seriously be considering and all out boycott of Biogen’s Adudamubad, not only for the obvious bribery that took place to get FDA approval, but also for the subsequent attack on an AD drug that cost less, actually improves cognition, and has zero safety concerns."
"At this point, it's very obvious the petition won't affect the trials and the FDA is looking forward the the ohase3 trial. Cassava has already raised the necessary the money and well funded for phase3 completion so there is no need to stabilize the stock price with repetitive PRs. Instead, it's back to business as usual.The shorts badly want to create panic selling by dragging this under $50. They want to drag it down as much as they can before moving on. They could care less about the effectiveness of the drug, just a way to make money.The stock price will remain volatile until a buyout or phase3 peer reviewed data result. The drug effectiveness in larger phase3 scale will tell the story of this very promising ad drug. I believe, so do the Cassava scientists and the NIH. There is no stopping this drug from proceeding, that's a the bottom line"
"Jordan Thomas, can you write up a petition to congress to investigate why the Monday after Super Bowl is not a federal holiday?"
KEEEP BUYING. WE CAN SEE 65!!
You people that keep asking Remi for PR today. How many times is he supposed to issue a statement? Daily? He came out and issued SAVA’S response. He did his part and didn’t leave shareholder hanging now all he can do is move in and run his business. Quit asking for him to make numerous statements. He did already
2010 copy machine prints will not halt the usa of fda !!!12 month data approaching will speak for itself .. that simple...
Strong bottom above 51.00. We’re going up from here.
"Of note, says Jones Trading's analyst Soumit Roy, is the fact that a number of the scientific articles “brought into question” were published in reputed journals with a “rigorous peer review process.”Furthermore, just days after the filing of the citizen’s petition, the FDA signed off on the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for both of simufilam’s pivotal Phase 3 trials.So, presented with all the info, what’s an investor to do? Well, for one, Roy thinks a “turnaround in the stock” is in the cards, saying that ahead of the anticipated 4Q21 12-month data readout, investors are presented with a “nice entry point.” Following the positive 9-month readout - which showed a 7-point ADAS-Cog improvement over historic placebo data - Roy expects the data to “maintain high degree of clinical benefits.”In fact, the 5-star analyst says he has not given “any merit to the biomarker data presented so far,” and to reach a “meaningful conclusion” will be looking at the difference in the biomarker levels between 6 and 9 months."
My only disappointment is that I wasnt able to add more during this time.
"The short squeeze on a low float stock like SAVA will be massive as all the short sellers will look to lock in profits by covering - however, as all the shorts run to the exits to cover there will be very limited shares available as longs will not give them up cheaply. This will cause a massive upside rally (when the news verifies that the claims by the law firm and its client are false)!! Its coming, if not today then later this week......smart investors are loading up for that rally as well as for the 12 month update and official start news of Ph3 as FDA has already authorized it via the SPA last week!!"
THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY .....
"If you were Remi, your priority is to deliver good results from Phase 3 to make FDA and shareholders happy but will take 2-3years to play out, which it what matters. Meanwhile, how the stock bottoms is beyond his control. However the shortlist can't do anything to him but he knows if the price drops low enough, he and his directors would probably buy more shares. In fact showing 12mpnth data would probably add fuel to fire. I would rather he make sure the enrollment for Ph3 is fast and furious and announce its commencement in Oct or earlier"
All the reiterated price targets are sky high. $215Not hard to see the upside value.
"Now, info on that newest director added to the SAVA board in June 2021. He is of great interest to me, personally. And it is all good:""Richard (Rick) Barry has served as a Director since June 2021. Since June 2015, Mr. Barry has also served as Director of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., (Nasdaq: SRPT). Mr. Barry has extensive experience in the investment management business. He was a founding member of Eastbourne Capital Management LLC, and served as a Managing General Partner and Portfolio Manager from 1999 to its close in 2010. Prior to Eastbourne, Mr. Barry was a Portfolio Manager and Managing Director of Robertson Stephens Investment Management. Mr. Barry holds a Bachelor of Arts from Pennsylvania State University.""Note that ""Robertson Stephens"" is the same Robert as in Sandford Robertson who has sat on SAVA's board as an independent director for over 20 years now. And he sent an ace to join the board at this time of incredible opportunity for Cassava Sciences. Sandy is getting a bit old now, in his early 80's now. And he got someone younger and very successful, and someone he can trust, to join in taking SAVA to home base. And they are both experts in deal making. Oh, and we have a deal being worked on now. Or is it basically done now, lol! News is just around the corner. Results of the early Simufilam data are surprising everyone. More studies and more robust studies are just around the corner with the ultimate study, the large phase 3 studies, just around the corner and about to start any day now. Big guns are joining the shop of SAVA. Remi says ""yes, yes, yes"".I suspect the next thing we hear from the FDA will be rather good . . .SAVA: $53.27 close"
this time I hope short seller will learn lesson
SAVA may go up as fast as it went down....
Not even exaggerating or saying we’re a meme stock what so ever but we could see a GME squeeze here come September. Come on remi drop the bomb !
"Can someone summarize in couple of paragraphs what's happened with SAVA, why is that a not big deal, and why should we buy the stock with a few key upcoming catalyst news?"
Simufilam trials will go on.
"The FDA Petition is starting to look like Swiss cheese. Or German cheese?Why hasn’t any outlet spoken w CUNY? An investigation into Dr Wang would be big time news, but I don’t see any reporting about this. Why? My guess: it isn’t true"
Buy today to and hold long... :)
"Biogen so desperate to move their failed Alzeheimer treatment, they are giving it away in desperation. Meanwhile, Fraud Street does everything they can to delay SAVA's product. Go figure. It's about money, and not people's health."
"The next FUD selloff event is already being planned by HF as this one was just too good. However, you got time to make money / make your money back as they will let this climb naturally into the 100's before they hit it hard again."
last Friday 45 mill shares last Thursday 30 mill sharesyesterday 15 mill sharestoday as of 330est 12 mill sharesall you need to know ...noitice no more hit articles ?smart money cashed in ...retests 70s soon
"Folks, I just read another post about the FDA language used in rejecting the shorts position. It looks like the FDA is also sick and tired of these guys and may open the door wide open to a class action law suits against the attorney and his short sellers buddies. I just can't wait for the announcement."
Great post from biodreamer88 (see below):Found this paper by Yale's Bordey group. It gives me some comfort someone else other than Wang's lab has also studied PT-125 and got positive result.https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/scitransmed/12/531/eaay0289.full.pdfTitle: Filamin A inhibition reduces seizure activity in a mouse model of focal cortical malformations
I brought more shares!! Price are just too good to resist...
Lawsuit's are just a distraction . The FDA confirmed phase 3. & in time will approve. big money will buy SAVA in September.
Half a dozen well-respected analysts have this at $125 or more. Easy buy.
Waiting on some positive news and 
Ceo of sls announced deal coming soon 3 weeks ago. 10x on news coming any day now. Ceo wouldnt make this claim if the ink wasnt almost dry.
"gotta admit, shorts did helluva job...but shorting is over. I wonder how many shorts are about to get reamed... it's easier to stay bullishm haha"
open 65-70 today
hits $70 today no doubt.
"Shorts are here showing sign of panic, they have not cover all their short yet that is why they are still here to spread rumors and doubts! FDA will never stop any clinical trials that has no safety concerns, to stop the trial just like someone ask the doctor to kill fetus before the baby was born. This is how the shorts are acting right now."
"For those that don't fully understand - when shorts start to cover the share price will actually accelerate even higher!! For this particular script it will be like throwing jet fuel on the fire and the share price will spike $3 to $5 a clip. Its just the way the BIG Boys of Wall St control the action, especially with small biotech with potential to skyrocket!! Us retail holders and traders just need to follow their coat-tails and make life changing profits!!"
A true power hour is on the way!
"They cannot get it under $50 no matter how much they try. They will give up soon and cover otherwise, Cassava next PR news will crush them since it will not be a defensive PR...Phase3 trial start date or partnership announcement."
"If Biogen wishes to look heroic by giving away its dangerous drug, it will backfire. It's a desperate move to save face, and the timing of it should erode any question of which company fuels the sabotage we're coping with. I predict that, in time, they'll open themselves up to lawsuits as more of those poor unsuspecting patients are injured by Aduhelm, adding more data to and thus confirming its faulty nature. And we'll still be here, patient."
"To verify a drug if it is working as intended, is that what trial is about? why law firms attack an experimental drug to delay the trial process? What is their motivation behind this? Why they doesnt even want to give a chance to this drug?"
Nothing will come out of the petition as it rarely does and phase 3 will start in mid Sept as planned. Very hard to prove fraud on old data when there is recent 12 mo of safe and positive Phase 2 testing data on human subjects the FDA has already reviewed. I'm not wrong here despite some of you hoping I am.
All because of a GREEDY short. Good news coming at any time and this flies to $100..then short squeeze to $140.
So the cognition improvement at 9 months is caused by what again? Placebo effect? At nine months? What about 12 months? Placebo effect does not last this long....think about it...and no safety issues... So why again would the FDA stop the phase 3 trials??..think beyond the smoke screen by the shorts. You can't fake cognition..either u have it or u don't.
"Biogen giving its drug away for free, haha they know it does not work. SAVA is the champion we got the goods REMI... Free always means no good."
There's way too much noise on this board lately. 
$Aciu and $Sava are the best investment for huge gains this will be $40 by Friday buy and hold great results
"Likely to see another PR in the morning for another Phase 3 trial to start in October 2021 targeting 1,089 participants.Official Title:A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, 76-week Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Two Doses of Simufilam in Subjects With Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's DiseaseEstimated Study Start Date :October 2021"
Phase 3 has two trials now defined. Over 1800 total participants to be enrolled.
How bout PR ing this Remi https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05026177?spons=Cassava&draw=2&rank=1
First Phase 3 study completion is Oct 2023
looks like $60 for today
SAVA phase 3 trials will go on!
"$SAVA odds are overwhelming SAVA returns to 70 bucks in less than a month. But the CEO has hinted of partnership, so that is back to all time highs, around 138 bucks a share. Tremendous risk reward. Remember, SAVA has a SPA, a contract now with the FDA. Breakthrough designation is very real possibility."
Another Law firm add.....nothing but negative articles....wow are they trying to push this stock down.
"ATTENTION ALL SHORTS: I just got word from a friend who knows the FDA. In a few days, maybe even tomorrow, the FDA will launch SAVA Phase 3 and denounce the Fake Petition. This will be back to $120-$140+ by next week. You better cover today or you will see this opening at $95 tomorrow and scramble."
