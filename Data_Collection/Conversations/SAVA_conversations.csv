Half a dozen well-respected analysts have this at $125 or more. Easy buy.
One thing I don't think has been debated/discussed is the fact that patients IMPROVED!
Bought 1000 shares of SAVA
So the cognition improvement at 9 months is caused by what again? Placebo effect? At nine months? What about 12 months? Placebo effect does not last this long....think about it...and no safety issues... So why again would the FDA stop the phase 3 trials??..think beyond the smoke screen by the shorts. You can't fake cognition..either u have it or u don't.
"Ways to $200+- Announce the partnership- Huge share buyback to show confidence- A independent 3rd party to verify results/ interpretations- FDA to dismiss petitionAny of these are very possible, can even happen this week...."
"The best SAVA news today is from Soumit Roy, the 5 Star analyst at Jones Trading. He has a $215 price target on SAVA and he has a great track record. This is a good entry point. Thank you, Soumit!"
"5 Star Analyst gives SAVA a $215 price target !!!!!! LETS GO Good Entry Point for Cassava Stock, Says Top Analyst - TipRanksMon, August 30, 2021, 10:25 AM"
"To every one, if you dont believe in the new drug feel free to sell. If you beleive is the perfect time to BUY. I will not try to convince you, but don' try to convince me either, is my money not yours. Got it !!"
"OK, longs. We are in control, for the most part, now. We break $55 and then $57 and then blastoff? shorts will be thinking of locking in profits . . .SAVA: $54.74"
never saw this before --- the company has 40 million shares outstahdn and did 93 million shares the last 4 days and 10 million so far today -- wow
"$SAVA odds are overwhelming SAVA returns to 70 bucks in less than a month. But the CEO has hinted of partnership, so that is back to all time highs, around 138 bucks a share. Tremendous risk reward. Remember, SAVA has a SPA, a contract now with the FDA. Breakthrough designation is very real possibility."
"How do we know that it's MMs and short sellers? Longs aren't selling, you can see that on the YMB. They walked it down in pre-market trading (where most of you can't do anything about it) by using low share counts and trading back and forth with each other to lower the price. Think about this....It opens at $52.93, over 15,000,000 shares traded and the price went up from open to $53.26. WHY? With that type of volume, the stock would normally go up. But no, the stock stays relatively flat to slightly up from open. WHY? They have no one to buy from! Longs are not selling, so all they can do is trade with each other to keep the price as low as they can get it. Think about it.....it doesn't make sense for the reaction to price and shares...except for shorts! DO NOT SELL!"
"The Wall street mafia behind SAVA crash should be (1) shut down, (2) arrested, (3) thrown into jail without bail, and (4) sued for damages to the shareholders and the company's reputation."
"Just bought 6,000 more shares at $54.By statistics in FDA history, Phase 3 will continue. I won’t sell until $1,000"
Simufilam trials will go on.
"I like what it says:Jones Trading's analyst Soumit Roy sticks to a Buy rating for SAVA shares, backed by a $215 price target. Following the big selloff, this target puts the upside potential at a whopping 311%. (To watch Roy’s track record, click here)Most of Roy’s colleagues are also undaunted by the allegations. Based on 4 Buys vs. 1 Hold, the stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. Moreover, the $154.80 average price target presents potential one-year share gains of a handsome 195%."
Just wait until tomorrow!!
"Are you saying categorically that FDA is not doing their job to evaluate and continue All Phase trials, and only the Shorts found a problem. My My so that’s the problem. And the Lemmings believe them."
The Phase 2 open label trial is conducted in 16 centers and management confirmed to us that all statistical analysis is conducted by an outside firm that is unaffiliated with Cassava. Several of the scientific articles brought into questions were published in reputed journals with rigorous peer review process. To be noted that the FDA signed off on the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for both of the Cassava’s pivotal Phase 3 trials in Alzheimer’s disease days after the filing of the Citizen’s PPer JTrading PT maintained at 215$ on FRIDAYYYY! :) same as B RILEYS maintained at 145$
If this wasn't a short attack and the selling was just due to the news we wouldn't see hundreds of short bashing posts here per hour.
Another Law firm add.....nothing but negative articles....wow are they trying to push this stock down.
How can Bloomberg call SAVA a meme stock and get away with it?! Anything goes now? Anybody can say anything with absolutely no consequences?
"Just got filled 10,000 shares at $54 .If you don’t believe, just check the transaction record within the last 2 minutes."
"They cannot get it under $50 no matter how much they try. They will give up soon and cover otherwise, Cassava next PR news will crush them since it will not be a defensive PR...Phase3 trial start date or partnership announcement."
lets see 60s today!
There is a major flaw with the lawsuit. Majority of the stock price losses is reaction to the lawsuit. It is like setting fire and then claiming damage and insurance money.
BUY BUY BUY!! 5 star analyst with new $215 price target.
"Good Entry Point for Cassava Stock, Says Top Analyst - TipRanksMon, August 30, 2021, 10:25 AMFurthermore, just days after the filing of the citizen’s petition, the FDA signed off on the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for both of simufilam’s pivotal Phase 3 trials.So, presented with all the info, what’s an investor to do? Well, for one, Roy thinks a “turnaround in the stock” is in the cards, saying that ahead of the anticipated 4Q21 12-month data readout, investors are presented with a “nice entry point.” Following the positive 9-month readout - which showed a 7-point ADAS-Cog improvement over historic placebo data - Roy expects the data to “maintain high degree of clinical benefits.”In fact, the 5-star analyst says he has not given “any merit to the biomarker data presented so far,” and to reach a “meaningful conclusion” will be looking at the difference in the biomarker levels between 6 and 9 months.“All biomarkers have failed in conclusively predicting clinical benefits in neurodegenerative diseases and broadly speaking, mechanisms of actions of several well adopted drugs are often not well established,” Roy summed up.Accordingly, Roy sticks to a Buy rating for SAVA shares, backed by a $215 price target. Following the big selloff,"
"If Biogen wishes to look heroic by giving away its dangerous drug, it will backfire. It's a desperate move to save face, and the timing of it should erode any question of which company fuels the sabotage we're coping with. I predict that, in time, they'll open themselves up to lawsuits as more of those poor unsuspecting patients are injured by Aduhelm, adding more data to and thus confirming its faulty nature. And we'll still be here, patient."
"Assuming any class action suits even approach going the distance (don't forget Remi has a huge warchest, only 40% of which is needed for P3), they'll all be consolidated into one case, as always happens, and it will be adjudicated 2-3 years down the line, by which time P3 reslts will be in."
SAVA phase 3 trials will go on!
It pains me to sound like a non technical pumper but please allow this one last post. This train is about to leave the station for the LAST time.
"Soumit Roy, a 5 star analyst, with a $215 PPS target.Thanks brother. I trust you!"
Is it worth buying now ?
BE PATIENT!!! 150-175 BY SEPT 10th ! Better NEWS WILL COME OUT BEFORE SEPTEMBER
"Wow. Big news is coming and Institutions know it. Today’s volume is over $14,604,000 ++ million with the average $5,812,495. They are trying to pull all the stops with the fake lawyer fillings. FDA approved ph 3, NIH reviewed and approved. Partnership deal is being finalized!! Hold."
"""Good Entry Point for Cassava Stock, Says Top Analyst"""
I have been buying small bio companies for 25 years. I do lots of DD and buy companies that are solid but ones that are heavily attacked by shorts after they have some moment. Araid is one example where I made lot of money. But there are numerous. Adam F. & Citron research have been my biggest adversaries. And the law firms always get their post on the boards to scare retail investors. This is just standard practice for the hedge funds / shorts. They are very good at taking SP down and making lots of money. Nothing new under the sun here. But in the end my picks have been winners. I put Sava on my watch list about 2 months ago. And have been waiting for this attack so I could buy shares. P3 is not going to be halted. 12 month data soon. And P3 will prove data to be solid. Add while you can. Hold tight. This to will pass. And you will be making money soon.
"To verify a drug if it is working as intended, is that what trial is about? why law firms attack an experimental drug to delay the trial process? What is their motivation behind this? Why they doesnt even want to give a chance to this drug?"
When they finally fold..expect 11 cents a share from class action..just sayin
