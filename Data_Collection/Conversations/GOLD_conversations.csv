Can't wait to lose more money on Barrick tomorrow.
Powell speaks at 2:30 today? Is there any chance it will be good news for gold mining stocks or am I just dreaming?
Ever wonder why are losing gobs of money while the company makes gobs of money? This has got to be the only industry that its investors lose money while the company profits.
"Jay Powell and his Fed cronies do not want to repeat December 2018, when the markets threw a “taper tantrum” after they announced a rate tightening cycle. So they will let inflation and negative yield burn long and slow like a campfire full of dollar bills."
Dividend was paid to shaeholders of Friday close. Those who buy now can receive another one in 3 months.
"This time the gold bottom is much higher then in 1998...The top will be higher than in 2020, obvi."
"BARRICK GOLD should buy $EGO and reap the 23 years of massive 69 tons annual copper & 140,000 oz annual gold not even valued in Eldorado's share price. Clean house of duplicate personnel and it's a massively accretive combo."
"CRAZY how inexpensive the shares of Fortuna (and many other junior/midsized producers and developers) have become. CRAZY! Now if the gold price was currently $1450, I could understand. But at this gold price the current stock prices in this sector are crazy. A few months back I modeled out ""worse case scenario"" for my portfolio (which NEVER happens) and it sure as heck happened ($EQX, $FSM, $FFMGF, $BBBXF, $FSXLF, $TSRMF, $GOLD and $KGC). My current net worth is down 20% thanks to these stocks! But I am still grateful for what I do have DESPITE the mental anguish of the past two months. Let's take a look at Fortuna:They just reported great earnings and positive cash flow. Lindero is demonstrating continued improvement (despite major direct and indirect impacts of Covid ravishing Argentina). Next quarter will include the newly acquired and highly profitable African operations. You can buy this for roughly the BOOK value of the company assets less debt!! So what happens if PRODUCTION INCREASES, PM PRICES INCREASE and SENTIMENT SHIFTS within the PM sector? Exponential stock price growth. What happens if just one of the three aforementioned factors were to improve? We should have at least some stock price improvement from here. I have a youtube channel where I post videos about the companies I own. Enter Fortuna Silver and Rons Basement and you should find them. Good luck."
"The world's second largest gold producer Barrick Gold will present the figures for the expired second quarter on Monday before the stock exchange opens. Due to the already reported production figures, but some facts are already known. A look at what we know and what analysts expect.Barrick Gold produced 1.04 million ounces of gold and 98 million pounds of copper in the second quarter. The average realized selling price for gold was $1,816 per ounce, and the average realized selling price for copper was $4.40 per pound. Barrick had also commented on costs in its press release on the preliminary production figures. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be six to eight percent higher than in the first quarter. For copper, the jump is expected to be as much as 22 percent. The lower production than in the first quarter (1.1 million ounces) was mainly due to planned maintenance work at Nevada Gold Mines as well as at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. In addition, there was a problem at Roaster at the Goldstrike mine.So the financials will be exciting on Monday: The market is expecting second-quarter earnings of $0.26 per share. Revenue is expected to be $3.07 billion. Based on the preliminary numbers already reported, there should be few surprises in terms of revenue. But investors should keep an eye on earnings. Better-than-expected net income could boost the stock.Barrick stock is treading water - the same is basically true for the entire gold sector. It seems investors are waiting for some sort of starting gun for the next rally. Yesterday it looked like a rally after weak ADP labor market data, but comments from Fed members put the brakes back on. However, another weak labor market tomorrow (Friday) could bring gold and also the mines like Barrick Gold out of their slumber."
Did you guys buy before the Fed pulled out of Jackson’s Hole? Hold for 2-3 years. The Fed is trapped and has played this game to the bitter end. There will never be a rate hike and if they ever taper it won’t last long. Dollar will crater and there will be a reset. Gold & Silver will be the only game in town...
Looks like J P Morgan is working overtime today on trying to short spot gold
"Relax guys. This is gonna be fine. Barrick is a great company, makes a ton of money at 1800 oh and also makes a ton at 1780 and 1750.....If you own this on Friday close you also get 23 cent dividend"
1800 spot this was over 21.00 im about to take my loss ive got 1000 shares at 22.19 gold was 1800 when i bought so its not making since
"Yesterday the announcement of a major gold purchase by the company Palantir. Well and you will say. A company that buys gold.But Palantir is not just any company. Co-founder is Peter Thiel. The man who started PayPal with Elon Musk. Thiel was also the first investor in Facebook.A high-end tech company founded by a top tech pioneer that buys gold, not cryptos. That already says something. But that's not all.Palantir is a data analysis company with top clients such as governments. So they know a lot. And the reason why they bought gold? They want to prepare for more black swan (sudden bad news that knocks the financial world down) events in the future."
I don’t know what’s the future of this stock I entered at 26 last year since then it’s falling and rising! I’m novice in investing metal stocks but when 10 yr yields prices go down gold would go up I read and gold always will have good value I heard but May be not the stock? Some say gold etf are good? So please share your opinion!
"As $Gold crashed in October -November, 1978, $NEM was 18% below its IPO price of a decade earlier. Many rational investors dumped their shares by then. Newmont would go on to 4X shortly after. Eldorado Gold is holding value."
"I’m 42 years old and cannot think of a better time in my lifetime to own gold assets. Exploding debt, negative real yields, grossly overvalued stock market, and rising geopolitical instability couple with declining US power and influence."
They had some interesting insights about GOLD on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Now it seems the gold price manipulations have been stopped. Someone found it necessary to drop millions of sell orders in an Asian empty market with only one goal...the gold price had to collapse ! Regulators close their eyes , Let's say they are on holiday... ! But gold price recovered sharply . So we can focus again on valuations . Barrick at 20 usd is very undervalued. With a P/E of 14 this stock , with huge gold reserves and most important no more debt , Barrick is definitly a stock to buy !! The gold price just broke upwards a very important resistance of 1754 usd. There is no important resistance to come until 1836 usd. But even this 1836 level will break upwards some day and Barrick might go 30 usd ! This stock is very cheap knowing the quality of this stock ! I am not a long term investor in Barrick but short -term (1-3 years) I am definitly in !"
"In a world so saturated with debt, we may never see positive real yields again in our lifetimes."
"Can you print money forever and not have inflation?Over the past 10 years.M2 money supply - doubled 10 to 20 Trillion.US Cars increase 0.37% per year - automation and cheap laborUS Food increase 1.81% per year - harder to import foodUS Houses increase 2.39% per year - Despite productivity, can't import land, and its an investmentUS Stocks increase 13.6% per year - This is where all the wealthy put their money. As stocks become too over valued the wealthy will look for new things that will hold value over time,,,, land, homes (notice the trend to build rentals instead of sell condos), international stocks and land, bit coins, maybe gold. If the bottom 90% get some of the money, then expect to see goods and service prices rise. Its been 40 years since the middle and lower class people got any of the money being produced."
Collect dividend better than in the bank plus 30% upside potential in September October when financial market is in turmoil
"About the Q2 report; the biggest bottleneck seems to be the increasing costs of sales (Q2 1107$ vs Q1 1073$)But if you look closely at the Reconciliation of Gold Cost of Sales on page 23 of the Barrick Q2 2021 Results, The only 2 things which increased were the Minesite sustaining capital expenditures and Project capital expenditures, and both have footnote F.F Capital expenditures:Capital expenditures are related to our gold sites only and are split between minesite sustaining and project capital expenditures. Project capital expenditures are distinct projects designed to increase the net present value of the mine and are not related to current production. Significant projects in the current year are the expansion project at Pueblo Viejo, construction of the Third Shaft at Turquoise Ridge, and the development of the Gounkoto underground. Refer to page 70 of the second quarter 2021 MD&A.GLTA"
"No cheerleading but this stock and gold are so compressed. It will be fun to see the explosion up when they can't manipulate anymore. Solid company with solid balance sheet and market cap. In my opinion, 30 plus in 6-9 months."
"guys, its going down because commodities are going down. However look at the miners and the oil companies. All very oversold.Its been taken down with the other miners and commodity stocks. This will rebound hard when people realize that commodities are needed and this will get bid up almost as fast as they've been bid down."
can you buy today and get the dividend
Going up to $20.74 today. $24.48 eow.
Yesterday we’ve seen the bottom. From now the stock price will go north
Last couple of weeks spot gold has been holding Meanwhile miners dropped to 1680 level price. Make sense? Hedge Fund has been bashing and loading cheap and they attack the miners more than spot. It means miners come back will be way faster than spot gold to catch up
time to buy gold stocks https://youtu.be/RSurL5gAlXo
does anyone think that if the fed raises rates that would be helpful to gold because it'll slow the economy creating stagflation?
Up today would be huge with today's buyers not receiving a dividend of $ 0.23.... I do wish that GOLD bought back shares at such a low price but I think they are looking strongly at acquisitions rather than share buy backs.
"Income bearing mutual funds will often bid the price up on dividend stocks like Barrick right before ex-div date, so they can pay their annuity clients a dividend, which isn't possible just holding capital gains stocks. This will be in mid $20's by EOW."
Today is X-dividend day.
"Gold is waiting for the financial melt down, plus the ability to attract Crypto investors."
Oh cool. .23 a share dividend.Oh wait were down like 10 bucks a share in a year.Should have just bought more bitcoin...
"Barrick Gold CEO contends that the gold industry “still needs to consolidate” and says that Barrick will also consider making acquisitions in copper.“What we will pursue are world-class copper assets in countries where we have a competitive advantage over other copper producers,” Bristow says. He has experience navigating often difficult politics involving host countries in Africa, where Randgold operated. $EGO $GOLD"

"Well, the Yahoo gestapo have been deleting my account every few days and I’ve had to resort to posting under pseudonyms, only to have those accounts deleted too. Not to worry, there are many ways around their silly, predictable actions. As Kbot warned back in May, there was going to be a summer correction in the sector, likely into August. Miners and silver reached oversold first and I had been saying since July that gold needed to get there as well before the sector could turn. Finally with the flash crash, gold got sufficiently oversold to join miners and silver. Note that the flash crash was a desperate attempt by bears to try and create panic in the middle of the night when there’s no volume. An honest seller of size wouldn’t have done that. It completely backfired on them, so that was a major fail and now we have a giant monthly up-candle if gold closes August around here in the next 2 trading days. I’d like to reiterate that there’s a massive breakout level in gold just 2.5% over market. Conversely, the dollar will start to break down with a move less than 2% below market. More importantly though, gold has been averaging $1800 all year, which is in the upper end of its decade-long range, while the dollar (which broke a decade-long uptrend in July 2020) has been clinging to life at the low end of its 6 1/2 year range for over a year now. The writing’s on the wall, folks. It won’t take much to engage both of these markets in opposite directions. So given all of these factors, it appears the summer correction in metals and miners is over (and miners are insanely dirt cheap at these levels). If I’m right, then the next wave up in the sector is close at hand and it won’t be subtle. Let’s see if next week or so we get confirmation of the breakout and I’ll update with price objectives for metals and miners. Enjoy your weekend, everyone (except all you bears and Yahoo communists, lol)#gld #gdx #gdxj #sil #silj #jnug #nem #gold #kl #aem #agi #eqx #pvg #ag #cde #hl #paas #auy #kgc #ego #ngd"
Gold just broke $1800
