"Barrick CEO an hour back on KITCO - ""News BitesBarrick CEO: Gold’s real rally hasn't even come yet; Mark Bristow on Q2 results, forward guidanceDavid Lin David Lin Tuesday August 10, 2021 13:24Kitco NewsShare this article:(Kitco News) - Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold, discusses with David Lin, anchor for Kitco News, why our current environment may be similar to that of 2008's, when gold initially lagged and then spiked three years later.""I always take people back to 2008, 2009, the Global Financial Crisis, all those troubles. The market didn't really react to that because it was desperate to see us come out of it before we really appreciate the damage that it had made. It was only 2011 when we saw everyone react to the damage, and of course the gold price went up and it stayed up until past 2013,"" Bristow said. ""I think we're finding the same thing now.""Bristow said that the company plans to expand copper production to about 20% of the business to meet the demands of the electrification of the economy and as gold deposits get bigger in scale.""It should, over time, represent 20% of our business. What I'm really focused on is how do I improve the quality of that part of that business. Copper is a very key component. Also, to remain relevant as a gold company, you've got to go for bigger and bigger gold deposits. When you move into what we call the porphyry deposits, more copper comes with gold,"" he said.On growth of assets, Bristow said that he prefers ""organic growth"", meaning in-house exploration as opposed to the acquisition of junior miners."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"The problem with current gold related industry is: there are very limited PR that can capture public's imagination. In the past we had children movies about golden cities, treasure caves filled with gold and special artifacts made with gold. We had heist movies and novels about stealing bags loaded with gold bars that shines in the dark. These graphics stimulate investors and everyday people alike; created an artifical and a real demand for gold. Now days with high tech and internet, crypto currencies have stolen that imagination and fuelled it's own growth. If you want gold price to go up, you cannot be stingy with PR."
Barrick Gold CEO Mark Bristow on the state of the gold market. Check out this very interesting interview yesterday on CNBC:
Everyone invested in gold miners or physical gold today are steps ahead of the federal reserve and wallstreet.
"Another 500 billion to a trillion for Louisiana from the printing FED ,same thing for California and fire ! They are going to dilute this dollars to zero !"
17 million paper oz to the rescue. And markets only been opened for 1 hour. Barrick would need over 4 years of hard labor across the planet to produce that much physical gold. Scam in plain sight.
"India purchased almost 1 1/2 tons more in gold this year compared to last. In value terms, July imports surged to $4.2 billion from $1.78 billion a year ago, I wonder when spot prices will reflect the increase in demand."
Barrick needs to stop paying dividends and use huge cash pile to increase copper production.
can you buy today and get the dividend
time to buy gold stocks https://youtu.be/RSurL5gAlXo
Dollar snapped higher this at the close the more they print the stronger it gets
Commodity selloff is nearing an end.This is oversold and soon to be moving higher
"On friday 06 august we are witnessing bankers game on comex manipulating down the gold price ! As long as this manipulation is tolerated by regulators and SEC, etc , it makes no sense anymore to invest in Barrick or other miners . You are looking at it ! The manipulation goes on , day by day !"
Well if you want the party line feds close to creating 1 million jobs there target.so maybe tapering sooner interest hike sooner based on good growth.Problem is if rate hike really to do with terrible inflation should be good for gold they dont want you to see it that way.Barrick ceo not playing their game to force acquisitions he sustaining operations for stable 10 years out rewarding with dividends! Just a thought if all the meme. Stocks went out of Business you loose more than a million jobs and it would be all for nothing!
"I look at my investment in Barrick Gold as a possible insurance policy for the pending overdue bear market retracement. It is also possible that when the federal reserve stops tapering (perhaps next week in Jackson Hole) that could be the start of the failures of the monetary system when the markets come to grips with the crushing debt levels in the tens of trillions of dollars globally. This compounded with the central banks printing of so much money is concerning to investor confidence. Here is the debt clock in the US today. Many countries on this earth have similar problems.Reminder $1 trillion is followed by 12 zeros. $1,000,000,000,000.https://www.usdebtclock.org/"
"If I won the lottery today, i’d buy only Barrick stocks!"
"People that buy gold stocks are the biggest doom and gloomers in the market, but hey, eventually they are right!"
"First time ever buying a good miner, but we live in unusual times. Half position this morning at $19.61. Trying to get the other half at $19.23. I will let that ride for 60 days unless something changes my mind."
the dollar actually gained strength over the last 48h compared to other currencies like PLN/EUR. how is that possible
"If there is another flash crash, I'll buy more of my other gold stock, AUY. They treat their share holders better. Barrick is sitting on a lot of cash while we lose a lot of cash. They should be stabilizing the stock price, instead they play a violin and stash the cash. Definitely not putting anymore into Barrick."
"CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF BARRICK GOLD CORPORATION1:42 pm ET August 10, 2021 (CFRA) PrintWe keep our 12-month target price at $28, which values Barrick at an EV/EBITDA of 8.4x our '21 EBITDA estimate, which is a premium to GOLD's two-year average forward EV/EBITDA of 7.3x, justified by our outlook for significantly higher cash returns to shareholders. We trim our '21 EPS estimate by $0.01 to $1.22 and '22's by $0.06 to $1.28. GOLD posts Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.23, $0.03 above consensus; sales missed by 1.0%. Q2 gold production declined Y/Y by 5.5% to 1.041 million ounces, as production was negatively impacted by planned maintenance shutdowns at Nevada Gold Mines' processing facilities and a mechanical mill failure at Carlin's Goldstrike roaster. Q2 free cash flow of negative $19 million (vs. positive $522 million in Q2 '20) reflects lower operating cash flow (due mostly to a build in working capital) and higher capex. The increase in capex is driven primarily by the Pueblo Viejo expansion project, where the mine life extension has the potential to be a significant positive catalyst."
"when two of the smartest guys buffet and munger dumped barrick it was pretty much game over over for barrick and gold,when two of the smartest guys buffet and munger dont want barrick or gold that seal the deal gold is deaddead money it will only crash from here on when usa ecomony start to zoom up and boom up next 3 to 4 years that what happen when ecomony started to roar back inthe 2007 - 2009 scaryscary crash,when ecomonystartedto boom back in 2010-2011 ecomonykeept gettingbetterin 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 golddrop to alow of $900 an ozfrom ahigh of $1900 an oz . then gold had a 4 to5 years crash from $1900 to 900 an oz in gold next 4 to 5 years ,samewill happen this time goldwill crashback be,low $800 to below 900 when useecomonystart to boom from hereon to next 4 to 5 years"
What is the exact reason why BARRiCK gold is going down?Gold and silver up today and this stock is down?
Smart investors are buying with both hands here. Do it like they do and be rewarded nicely.
"there are plenty of bashers here, must be trying hard to protect their short positions"
Too cheap for cashflow $GOLD is generating. All the money printing is going to push gold higher by end of year! Buy!
"Spot prices for Gold remain high; Barrick keeps making profits quarter over quarter; outlook remains positive for GOLD; yet the stock price just keeps falling month over month!!! Well, ""this can only mean one thing; I don't know what it is."" Quote from Peter Falk's character in the movie: Murder by Death. There you have it investors: My words of wisdom for this company. You're welcome."
Dividend plus Capital Distribution....
"Just as a reminder. ""In times of inflation and uncertainly, the yellow metal is a place for safety."" Meanwhile in the real world, "
Just a thought I am not happy with the stock performance along with most shareholders.Palantir just bought 50 million in Bullion....Why doesn't Barrick pick a price (1800?) If spot is below that they buy there own gold at spot so countries can get there taxes and they stick the bullion in the treasury?Stick the Bullion in a banks basement in London or something and pay a few million a year to have them guard it.
I think we may have just bottomed today. As long as gold holds up.
Up today would be huge with today's buyers not receiving a dividend of $ 0.23.... I do wish that GOLD bought back shares at such a low price but I think they are looking strongly at acquisitions rather than share buy backs.
I don’t know what’s the future of this stock I entered at 26 last year since then it’s falling and rising! I’m novice in investing metal stocks but when 10 yr yields prices go down gold would go up I read and gold always will have good value I heard but May be not the stock? Some say gold etf are good? So please share your opinion!
"Tapering shampering. By the time they taper it wont matter because there will be another crisis that fuels gold. My guess, global recession resulting in a lowering USD."
Hedge Fund Manager David Neuhauser sees “massive buying opportunity” in gold https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/why-gold-is-a-massive-buying-opportunity-right-now.html
"Physical gold seems to have formed a “triple bottom” at $1,675 per ounce, bouncing nicely off of it each time. The future for gold, and by extension, a well managed miner like Barrick, is very bright."
"Final blood bath before we rise again in the new cycle, will last one or two more days"
14 million paper oz.s traded before lunch. Lol. That’s some manipulation. Will Basel III take gold to a new level in Jan? Or will manipulation continue.
Surprised with all the talk from Barrick's CEO about acquisition possibilities over past year or two they haven't said or done much since. It seems with the discounted prices of most gold stocks they would be snatching up a few companies before the next run on gold. Any thoughts?

ok i bought more. all in on china and gold 750 $BABA 500 $PRX 1000 $GOLD wish me luck. see you in 5 (years)
Today is X-dividend day.
Gold just broke $1800
RSI indicator indicates this is Way oversold.Get ready for the Bounce. Ex-div in 11 days.
"Return to shareholders is obviously not happening through stock price movement. Would like to see further increases to their sustaining dividend. Special dividends are nice and all but increasing sustained dividends signals to shareholders that a continuation of healthy earnings is expected. If Barrick is true to their word, of not over deploying cash to new projects, then at least they can do is commit to a higher dividend yield. Let’s see it boys."
it proves that yesterday was a fake breakdown to scare away panic selling people and institutions cover their shorts and buy more
"This time the gold bottom is much higher then in 1998...The top will be higher than in 2020, obvi."
US retail spending for July coming out next week; number will be down huge. Gold price will rise back over $1800 by Thursday
"BARRICK GOLD should buy $EGO and reap the 23 years of massive 69 tons annual copper & 140,000 oz annual gold not even valued in Eldorado's share price. Clean house of duplicate personnel and it's a massively accretive combo."
"In a world so saturated with debt, we may never see positive real yields again in our lifetimes."
Strong buy Barrick (GOLD) at this level!
relax gold always finds balance with the money supply
Just looked at the 3016 10qDebt was 6.6 billion higher. EPS was 12 cents per share vs 29 cents per share today. No dividend paid vs 23 cents per share today. Yet the stock price was 21 vs 20 today. Any thoughts?
BUY GOLD!!! With such low interest rates Gold is one of my biggest positions. My reasons are fairly simple. Gold offers no yield. I am looking into a $GOLD and $GGM.V / $GBBFF for a junior position.
"its our time to shine boys. the people who kept buying gold dips will ve rewarded not only with massive capital gains, but with a nice dividend yield while waiting for it."
1Y ago: UBS: buy #gold (price $2000/oz)Now: UBS: sell #gold (price $1785/oz)You know what to do
"Barrick Gold CEO contends that the gold industry “still needs to consolidate” and says that Barrick will also consider making acquisitions in copper.“What we will pursue are world-class copper assets in countries where we have a competitive advantage over other copper producers,” Bristow says. He has experience navigating often difficult politics involving host countries in Africa, where Randgold operated. $EGO $GOLD"
"gold green yet GOLD in red numbers, great"
Keep giving us below 21.50 per share or around. Banks are scared and don't want to let gold run. They are trying to surprise price until they bankrupt. TD will be next bank for bankruptcy for keep shorting gold
"Selling gold stocks a phenomenal rate in prep for Powell big taper talk today at 2. They're selling everything. Sell gold, sell the mills, sell the workers, sell the pickaxe, sell the coffee maker for the miners, sell the futures, sell the past, sell it all all the way to 18!"
I only bought 25% of the company today. I’ll buy the remaining 25% tomorrow before the CPI numbers come out Wednesday. Nice flash crash. Easy money...
"I’m 42 years old and cannot think of a better time in my lifetime to own gold assets. Exploding debt, negative real yields, grossly overvalued stock market, and rising geopolitical instability couple with declining US power and influence."
"Goldman Sachs sets price target for gold to 2300 , Coming 5 years it might go to 5000. With the leverage of Barrick it means one thing: "
"Who will be selling at this bottom price, only means Hedge Fund will cover their Shorts and lure your shares"
There is no reason that GOLD lags to all miners today. Option expiry day?
"Its 40 minutes till open and all around wallstreet the sell orders are being prepared. Gold is about to fall under 1800 and news writters have the story written ""Gold falls below psychologically important 1800."""
"Should we be worried? Lets, see - Hummm. Afghanistan’s capital Kabul has fallen, the elected president has fled the country and the Taliban is back in charge of everything. Ladies: pay attention. Burkas are now mandatory. Rules at that hair salon have changed. No more getting your hair done. Here is a list of current services and charges. Hand cut off - 200 AfganisBoth Hands cut off 300 Afganis (Best Deal)Beheading – 500 AfganisSimple Throat cut – 300 Afganis. How did this happen? Just say thank you Uncle Joe, as the boys are back in town (Taliban). How long will it take until a new super terrorist operation is up and running in Afghanistan? My guess is less than a month. We sacrificed so much money, blood and lives. Uncle Joe says Too Bad, Soooo Sad. No responsibility here? Just water under the bridge! You know another attack is now coming toward American soil. Might I suggest that you buy some physical gold? You know its coming and this didn't have to happen. Who is responsible? We all need to look in the mirror. Elections have consequences."
Picked up some more today longs ….
"While everyone was bashing and complaining, I bough more"
Dividend was paid to shaeholders of Friday close. Those who buy now can receive another one in 3 months.
"As $Gold crashed in October -November, 1978, $NEM was 18% below its IPO price of a decade earlier. Many rational investors dumped their shares by then. Newmont would go on to 4X shortly after. Eldorado Gold is holding value."
"Once more we are witnessing the poor gold industry being crushed down. Bankers are playing with gold on the Comex , their favorite play tool ! Gold miners as Barrick and Newmont are great stocks and are very undervalued...but their true value will never , never appear and shine as bankers keep on playing on Comex. Today they pushed the gold price below the very important 1800 usd level ! Great job, bankers, congrats. Regulators prefer looking at Olympics instead of investigate these bankers and their abuses !"
What do you guys forecast for next week trend?
"Flash crash was just a wash out to allow the big boys to cover their shorts:-) Such occasions often turn out as the absolut low and perfect buying point before a huge uptrend. Strong buy Barrick Gold (GOLD) and looking forward to todays Q2 earnings with conference call. Shall we hear increased dividends, next special dividend end of August and a stock buyback programme? Oh, yes please!"
"i haven't received any dividend from gold, anyone know why?"
"Well, the Yahoo gestapo have been deleting my account every few days and I’ve had to resort to posting under pseudonyms, only to have those accounts deleted too. Not to worry, there are many ways around their silly, predictable actions. As Kbot warned back in May, there was going to be a summer correction in the sector, likely into August. Miners and silver reached oversold first and I had been saying since July that gold needed to get there as well before the sector could turn. Finally with the flash crash, gold got sufficiently oversold to join miners and silver. Note that the flash crash was a desperate attempt by bears to try and create panic in the middle of the night when there’s no volume. An honest seller of size wouldn’t have done that. It completely backfired on them, so that was a major fail and now we have a giant monthly up-candle if gold closes August around here in the next 2 trading days. I’d like to reiterate that there’s a massive breakout level in gold just 2.5% over market. Conversely, the dollar will start to break down with a move less than 2% below market. More importantly though, gold has been averaging $1800 all year, which is in the upper end of its decade-long range, while the dollar (which broke a decade-long uptrend in July 2020) has been clinging to life at the low end of its 6 1/2 year range for over a year now. The writing’s on the wall, folks. It won’t take much to engage both of these markets in opposite directions. So given all of these factors, it appears the summer correction in metals and miners is over (and miners are insanely dirt cheap at these levels). If I’m right, then the next wave up in the sector is close at hand and it won’t be subtle. Let’s see if next week or so we get confirmation of the breakout and I’ll update with price objectives for metals and miners.

"About the Q2 report; the biggest bottleneck seems to be the increasing costs of sales (Q2 1107$ vs Q1 1073$)But if you look closely at the Reconciliation of Gold Cost of Sales on page 23 of the Barrick Q2 2021 Results, The only 2 things which increased were the Minesite sustaining capital expenditures and Project capital expenditures, and both have footnote F.F Capital expenditures:Capital expenditures are related to our gold sites only and are split between minesite sustaining and project capital expenditures. Project capital expenditures are distinct projects designed to increase the net present value of the mine and are not related to current production. Significant projects in the current year are the expansion project at Pueblo Viejo, construction of the Third Shaft at Turquoise Ridge, and the development of the Gounkoto underground. Refer to page 70 of the second quarter 2021 MD&A.GLTA"
"It’s about to go down. Fed is being pressured to raise rates from the other fed presidents. Rates go up, gold drops, then market corrects and everyone jumps into gold causing the price to rally. Then fed has to cut rates to stop the market crash. Then more jump into gold as they see the fed cannot raise rates ever snd the dollar is deemed worthless."
"Can you print money forever and not have inflation?Over the past 10 years.M2 money supply - doubled 10 to 20 Trillion.US Cars increase 0.37% per year - automation and cheap laborUS Food increase 1.81% per year - harder to import foodUS Houses increase 2.39% per year - Despite productivity, can't import land, and its an investmentUS Stocks increase 13.6% per year - This is where all the wealthy put their money. As stocks become too over valued the wealthy will look for new things that will hold value over time,,,, land, homes (notice the trend to build rentals instead of sell condos), international stocks and land, bit coins, maybe gold. If the bottom 90% get some of the money, then expect to see goods and service prices rise. Its been 40 years since the middle and lower class people got any of the money being produced."
Gold yet again above $1800 like a turtle peeking out of its shell.
Aug 2020 share price 38.64 aug 2021 everthing fine! Bond yields 10 year 1.3 huge victory it really is a laugh! Buy while you can!
"What’s not to like. Financials are great. Plus, nobody wants to buy it, near 52 week low. Check out the PE, if that even means anything anymore."
How about that Basel III. Really changed things huh?
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Is the US dumping gold to pay off foreign debt?
I love my Gold
Bought some.High quality company that cares about investors. Special dividend coming up. Too cheap to pass up
16 million paper oz folks. And rising. Every 3-4 business days we see the global annual supply of physical gold trade in these fake markets. Buy physical while you can
"What’s being discussed by the Federal Reserve Board with no final decision is a mere taper of bond purchases, not a rate hike or a reduction of the Fed’s massive balance sheet. And it would not start until later this year at the earliest. And it would be gradual."
"Buying more at a discount, with a possible war going on in Afghanistan, Gold is power!"
hmm. I am really tempted to sell here but usually that backfires. Sentiment is so bearish right now and I think I will stay away from commodities in the future. At least for secular growth you can buy an amazing company at a reasonable price and leave it for years to grow. For cyclical industries you need to get the timing right or you are completely dead money. I wish everyone the best but I think there are easier ways to make money as I'm finding out.
Next year share buybacks while inflation increases?
Price of this stock will go up sooner than we are led to believe.
"Listen, all you guys jumping in expecting a quick rise in share price due to economic numbers, interest rates, debt, copper mines, etc. It doesn’t work that way. This stock and other precious metals stocks are manipulated. They always will be until they aren’t. You either invest and hold knowing it could be another year or 20 years, or you choose that you don’t want to wait and invest in something else or keep ur money in the bank. This will never make sense and JP Morgan and other banks will always slam it down whenever they can. They will continue to do it until they can’t. When will it stop? When the dollar drops to nothing and the general public across the world loses confidence in the US dollar. Then and only then the banks can’t control the price of precious metals. The thing is, if ur not in before this happens, ur going to be too late. That’s just how it’s going to play out..."

"Well most of people forget that barrack also sell copper which is close to all time high. Gold is also in good position, we will see it above 2000 inflation will do the job dont worry. This id good buying opportunity. Everytjing under 20 is perfect"
"You peeps look for news stories on gold right? They are pushing for a depressed price. Calling for gold to be lower, cant break 1800, warning investors to get out, usb bank calls for 1600. They all have the same take, no different then the news media."

Barrick Gold is up 4.94% to 20.18
Gold always gets sold off after a tiny runup pure bs when we all know inflation is permanent. It puts in a topping tail after a gap up breakout into absolutely no resistance.
Collect dividend better than in the bank plus 30% upside potential in September October when financial market is in turmoil
Just off the wire: US home price growth surges at fastest rate in more than 30 years. So does gold surge as a inflation hedge? No the price goes way down because now the FED will have to talk taper sooner!
"Barrick Gold, the best stock for the next decade!"
"Gold was able to recover yesterday, silver was able to recover yesterday and mining stocks also showed their friendly side yesterday. A trend reversal? It would be much too early to talk about it. What we saw yesterday in the precious metals sector was a step in the right direction. Not more. But also not less. There are certainly indicators that are encouraging.As explained several times, the positive divergence in the GOLD-chart is encouraging. Chart guru Avi Gilburt talks about this being seen very, very often in the area of a bottom in silver. To that end, gold has so far successfully defended the $1,800 level. As I said, it's too early to infer any kind of high probability bottom from this. But for weeks, months actually, we have been seeing the potential for a major bottom in the precious metals sector again. A little side note: Gold ETFs saw their highest inflow in six weeks yesterday at 8.6 tons.So why are we picking up Barrick Gold now? There are several reasons. The stock is now cheaply valued from a historical perspective. But that's just a side note. More importantly, if there is a potential bottom in the precious metals sector, the big stocks should see relatively quick inflows of funds, which should make Barrick Gold a profiteer. And even more important is the chart picture: on the short time axis, Barrick Gold seems to have put in a bottom. The stock is making an effort to break out to the upside. This results in a relatively good risk/reward ratio for us.At the moment, Barrick Gold is a speculation on a potential bottom in the precious metals sector. If this bottom is confirmed, then GOLD will rise towards $30."
Yesterday we’ve seen the bottom. From now the stock price will go north
Figured the drastic drop earlier in the week along with days of negative news about gold and silver was 'their' attempt to drive price down so they can buy low and make out big on the run-up that has now started.
does anyone think that if the fed raises rates that would be helpful to gold because it'll slow the economy creating stagflation?
"what did i tell you, today after the fed meeting we in green  all day long"
"Just bought something from walmart that was $3.68 in Jan 2020, $5.68 in Jan 2021 and $8.48 yesterday. No Mr Powell, there isnt any inflation."
Miners doing the opposite of spot price right now instead its following the nasdaq.
People starting to wake up that the feds lie to people about inflation. They said inflation was transitory since half year ago. I think its temperory inflation next 10 years
Fire sale near 1 year lows with very high dividends and the usd crash around the corner
Q2 earnings will rock on Monday. Plus increased dividend as well as special dividend end of August. And stock buyback!
The taliban run things like the saudis and they had less to do with 911 now im buying gold because America is bankrupt the fed cant raise rates much the interest will be 1.5 trillion and the tax base is 3.5 trillion and the only option is the create a lot of inflation so gold real estate and crypto should out perform the s and p 500
"I left 10% of the company for you guys to fight over. After this past weeks flash crash, I now own 90%. See you guys at $100..."
"I am amazed how people look into Barrick and don’t see there is a conspiracy and war against this company in particular and miners in general. I don’t know who has the power and influence to crash this stock, but for sure there are some hidden players (maybe bankers or Fed?). This is so dangerous, this means the whole market is rigged. This stock at this price of gold should be around $30. But, instead they crashed it to below $20, the price of 30 years ago!! This stock is definitely a buy at this level and even higher because of the inflation, uncertain market future due to COVID, gold is safe heaven, tons of cash flow, no debt… and on and on, this is not the question, BUT the million-dollar question is WHY THEY CRASH THIS STOCK AND WHO ARE THEY? The CEO and the board of the company instead of defending the company they contribute to waste the wealth of the investor by their silence and ignorance. So sad some people can manipulate people’s wealth in a democracy environment like ours."
Who else kept loadin up last week?
"On the 26th of august 2019 gold price was at 1475 usd ! Barrick gold share was at 20 usd ...Today the 30th of august 2021 ...2 years later.., gold price is above 1800 usd and Barrick is at 20 usd....Mr, Bristow, I think we have a problem here .....?"
Ever wonder why are losing gobs of money while the company makes gobs of money? This has got to be the only industry that its investors lose money while the company profits.
Strong buy GOLD! Smart investors are buying with both hands now. Check back soon at much higher prices!
"Buying with Conviction here, especially after the earnings are out and had a chance to listen to the CC presentation. Don't fall into the negative comments by the paid bashers like Daniel. Also, the chart lovers ignore the consolidation that happens in this industry. For example the chart does not factor in the merger of Barrick and Rand Gold in 2018. All those mine assets in Africa are not free."
"if it wasn't for the paper gold MASSIVE sell off, we would be at 22:50 easy."
1800 dollar gold and this is 20 dollars it should be 23 i guess its just a divedend stock that does nothing
yey i made a dollar/share since i invested :)
"￼ we all realize that were likely holding the stock of the decade, no? That was a huge learning speed and this is just the beginning. Anybody who thinks the POG is going to stay under 1700 for the next couple of years needs to have their head checked. This is $100 stock in six months￼"
People are just scared now. They need some sleep before realising Barrick is the best stock to buy right now and hold for at least a decade.
"Palantir just bought $50 million in physical gold, love it!"
Good entry?
"Appears that Sunday night's deep plunge and subsequent sharp recovery was someone's manipulation attempt to buy cheap, no? Gold and Silver should rise from here on...."
"Amateurs everywhere, LOL Gold is my portfolio stable."
Very frustrating with this stock the last few days. Last week really pounced us. Now the last 2 sessions gold futures have been pretty solid and Barrick is hardly responding. Below $20 should have been ideal discount entries. I’m hoping this is just the summer market doldrums......
"Gold is strong. It is the only resource that is currently green, all the others are red. That says enough !"
"Within a while, people can’t afford stuff because of the high inflation. Look at Turkey, there’s a lot of poverty. Companies go bankrupt because people only afford food. People want to ensure their wealth via gold. That’s why you should own Barrick stock and/or gold."
"Guys who cares what powel say? real rates are negative, inflation is at 5%. If they try to raise interest rates, the whole house of cards collapses. Let them talk, and pretend they have a plan."
should I wait till $18 hits or $17?
"when the big banks load up on the dips, then they will stop manipulation of the paper gold."
"CPI lower then expected! Thank the lord! A higher then expected number would have smushed us. Now if we could only close above 1760. That may be reaching a bit but the important thing is stability. No more freefall, I hope."
spot prices higher than when this was $22
"Jay Powell and his Fed cronies do not want to repeat December 2018, when the markets threw a “taper tantrum” after they announced a rate tightening cycle. So they will let inflation and negative yield burn long and slow like a campfire full of dollar bills."

"You saw those Hercules took off from Kabul airfield? And people grab on to the plane while it took off? That's gonna be the shorters in a couple of days. Market is a pendulum, it swings and swings. Once again, it is swing the other way. Nothing new."
"Relax guys. This is gonna be fine. Barrick is a great company, makes a ton of money at 1800 oh and also makes a ton at 1780 and 1750.....If you own this on Friday close you also get 23 cent dividend"
"The problem with investing in Barrick is the number of shares outstanding almost 2,000,000,000 get your head around that number. They should do a 5 to 1 reverse split."
"Do you guys think a shut down in mining due to covid is being priced in? A crash in the market in general? This isnt a tapering fear, gold isnt crashing."
"The world's second largest gold producer Barrick Gold will present the figures for the expired second quarter on Monday before the stock exchange opens. Due to the already reported production figures, but some facts are already known. A look at what we know and what analysts expect.Barrick Gold produced 1.04 million ounces of gold and 98 million pounds of copper in the second quarter. The average realized selling price for gold was $1,816 per ounce, and the average realized selling price for copper was $4.40 per pound. Barrick had also commented on costs in its press release on the preliminary production figures. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be six to eight percent higher than in the first quarter. For copper, the jump is expected to be as much as 22 percent. The lower production than in the first quarter (1.1 million ounces) was mainly due to planned maintenance work at Nevada Gold Mines as well as at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. In addition, there was a problem at Roaster at the Goldstrike mine.So the financials will be exciting on Monday: The market is expecting second-quarter earnings of $0.26 per share. Revenue is expected to be $3.07 billion. Based on the preliminary numbers already reported, there should be few surprises in terms of revenue. But investors should keep an eye on earnings. Better-than-expected net income could boost the stock.Barrick stock is treading water - the same is basically true for the entire gold sector. It seems investors are waiting for some sort of starting gun for the next rally. Yesterday it looked like a rally after weak ADP labor market data, but comments from Fed members put the brakes back on. However, another weak labor market tomorrow (Friday) could bring gold and also the mines like Barrick Gold out of their slumber."
"This is a joke. With the greatest political disaster since the civil war and a terrorist attack today, gold moves from being down 10 buck to gaining a few bucks and then the selling continues. There is nothing left that is real is this country. Everything is rigged/manipulated for a set outcome and nothing seems to shake it....yet."
"Now it seems the gold price manipulations have been stopped. Someone found it necessary to drop millions of sell orders in an Asian empty market with only one goal...the gold price had to collapse ! Regulators close their eyes , Let's say they are on holiday... ! But gold price recovered sharply . So we can focus again on valuations . Barrick at 20 usd is very undervalued. With a P/E of 14 this stock , with huge gold reserves and most important no more debt , Barrick is definitly a stock to buy !! The gold price just broke upwards a very important resistance of 1754 usd. There is no important resistance to come until 1836 usd. But even this 1836 level will break upwards some day and Barrick might go 30 usd ! This stock is very cheap knowing the quality of this stock ! I am not a long term investor in Barrick but short -term (1-3 years) I am definitly in !"
Bought some to add to my portfolio of dividend stocks. Good price will never sell!
"CRAZY how inexpensive the shares of Fortuna (and many other junior/midsized producers and developers) have become. CRAZY! Now if the gold price was currently $1450, I could understand. But at this gold price the current stock prices in this sector are crazy. A few months back I modeled out ""worse case scenario"" for my portfolio (which NEVER happens) and it sure as heck happened ($EQX, $FSM, $FFMGF, $BBBXF, $FSXLF, $TSRMF, $GOLD and $KGC). My current net worth is down 20% thanks to these stocks! But I am still grateful for what I do have DESPITE the mental anguish of the past two months. Let's take a look at Fortuna:They just reported great earnings and positive cash flow. Lindero is demonstrating continued improvement (despite major direct and indirect impacts of Covid ravishing Argentina). Next quarter will include the newly acquired and highly profitable African operations. You can buy this for roughly the BOOK value of the company assets less debt!! So what happens if PRODUCTION INCREASES, PM PRICES INCREASE and SENTIMENT SHIFTS within the PM sector? Exponential stock price growth. What happens if just one of the three aforementioned factors were to improve? We should have at least some stock price improvement from here. I have a youtube channel where I post videos about the companies I own. Enter Fortuna Silver and Rons Basement and you should find them. Good luck."
spot gold didnt get the wallstreet memo to sell.
US retail sales will disappoint tomorrow...Gold will jump $50 tomorrow. Debt ceilling coming up as well.
Did you guys buy before the Fed pulled out of Jackson’s Hole? Hold for 2-3 years. The Fed is trapped and has played this game to the bitter end. There will never be a rate hike and if they ever taper it won’t last long. Dollar will crater and there will be a reset. Gold & Silver will be the only game in town...
Double bottom forming with gradual increase back to $30+
Personally I like holding physical $gld and silver. I trust it more than the  Fed funny money. $gold
Soaring inflation and a dollar thats gaining value lmao. A government spending more money than ever on top of it all. The fed buying the debt with fake money. This country produces almost nothing and gets paid for it. Trade deficits worse than ever. Now demand is falling because stuff is too expensive. Everything reaching ath's except gold. Futures looking better and better.
Printing another 3.5 trillion makes the USD very strong. Sell gold. Makes sense???
"Spot gold and especially gold miners are so oversold and technically ripe for a strong trend-reversal and rebound-spike now...................... buy while prices are depressed and cheap and then hold long and strong for the ride up imho.................. plus enjoy the dividends and the additional special dividend (all holders on 31st August 2021 cob are eligible for $0,23/share)................."
"Tons of worldwide political and economical reasons for spiking spot gold (and let's not forget about Covid-19 and Delta). Pick your favourite reason and multiply. Top gold mining companies like Barrick (GOLD) are totally oversold and the chart is screaming for a break-out north. Barrick is debt free with solid financials and offers a decent lever to spot gold. Enjoy safe haven status plus nicely increased dividens and special dividends due to huge free cash flow. Q2 earnings with outlook next Monday, 9th August 2021. And next dividend day ($0,23/share) end of August."
"Nice little rip today, see if it holds into the afternoon….Good luck longs"
"Perfect time to buy Barrick now. Buy low, sell high. It’s that simple. Be patient, October= a historical stock exchange crashing month. Buy Barrick and just wait for two months…"
"Yesterday the announcement of a major gold purchase by the company Palantir. Well and you will say. A company that buys gold.But Palantir is not just any company. Co-founder is Peter Thiel. The man who started PayPal with Elon Musk. Thiel was also the first investor in Facebook.A high-end tech company founded by a top tech pioneer that buys gold, not cryptos. That already says something. But that's not all.Palantir is a data analysis company with top clients such as governments. So they know a lot. And the reason why they bought gold? They want to prepare for more black swan (sudden bad news that knocks the financial world down) events in the future."
Don’t worry the government is spending 4.3 trillion this week. Senate approved infrastructure bill and budget. Keep printing the dollar and everything will be fine. Lol
Powell speaks at 2:30 today? Is there any chance it will be good news for gold mining stocks or am I just dreaming?
Dont be afraid to buy at these prices. These days will pass.
"Just curious, what is everyone's sell price? With as bad as these last few months have been, I know people have to be thinking ""Im out at $X."""

"Kitco News, on YouTube just did a great interview with Barrick CEO. Really good. Check it out"
So basically gold mining stocks will follow the spot price which will be inverse of the dxy. Regardless of inflation or fundamentals.
"Gold is rising! While you’re here, Barrick is earning a lot money for you."
"In the blink of an eye, gold and silver plummet. What's the cause this time? This is getting old."
"Another 6 million paper oz to get physical gold back to neutral, while they accumulate more of the real thing. 23 total paper oz so far today, that’s 25% of entire global production. All traded today in wonderful paper representation."
1800 gold and you guys are complaining? Gold has never averaged over 1800 for over a year. The bears tried to flash crash this 2 weeks ago and it lasted 30 minutes? Now it’s back over 1800. Can’t you guys read between the lines? This stock is going to go wherever gold takes it and gold ain’t going down. Once gold takes out 1865 it’s taking out old highs. That’s 60 points away. Most of you guys have no idea what your doing. Sell as much as you want. I’m buying...
Iv’e been a GOLD shareholder for a while.I wish the company would announce a stock buyback already.They would not even have to purchase any stock.Just have it as an option and to have shareholders backs.At least this might create a floor for the stock.Good luck to everyone.
"I continue to believe Delta is going to slow the economy further, the general market is going to pull back on the combination of that and the taper, and then the devaluation of the dollar will take us higher. (as our transitory inflation and deficits grow.)"
"6 million paper oz sold. Not the usual avalanche but we never know what they have in store, using infinitely available paper gold to set the price of a Li mited physical commodity."
"We get the triple whammy, overreaction before the Fed speaks, overreaction after the Fed speaks and overreaction to what the Fed May do next time they speak."
"Barrick and Newmont should merge together ! It would lower AISC and they would have an extreme Cartel power on metals ! Bristow tried before ,I hope that the idea is not dead .With all the cashflow they generate every quarter they would be able to buy a junior every quarter ! It is time to be big like Amazon and company"
The FED is always there when gold rises. Market manipulation!
Last couple of weeks spot gold has been holding Meanwhile miners dropped to 1680 level price. Make sense? Hedge Fund has been bashing and loading cheap and they attack the miners more than spot. It means miners come back will be way faster than spot gold to catch up
"Barrick CEO on CNBC - "" No One Believes In Fiat Currencies Any More""...""""gold acts as a stabilizer against volatility in a portfolio while the deltas in crypto are enormous.""....""you can't just create value... and what you are really buying [with crypto] is energy.""...""""Without a doubt, this is a buying opportunity and you still need a 5% or so part of your investments in gold."""""
"I see banks and comex start covering short in miners, spot price usually lag, the lowest of previous 1750 level is not broken. Meaning triple bottom. Any below 21 share is a buy"
"Barrick (GOLD) is getting ready to break out north - see chart. Top gold miners reporting Q2 earnings next days (Newmont tomorrow and Barrick on 9th August 2021) should boost the whole gold sector. Please note that the average analyst price target for Barrick (GOLD) is US$ 29,29 - almost 50% upside potential plus quarterly dividends and special dividends. What is not to like about that? Much better sleep than with a lot of other stocks."

Looks like J P Morgan is working overtime today on trying to short spot gold
"My current miners portfolio: AUY, GOLD, IAG, EQX, KL, and GPL. I'm looking at adding a few more miners but maybe just better to dollar cost average down here on the ones I have. thoughts anyone? thanks"
first class miner thats trading near 52 week lows even though gold and copper are well of their lowsIf youre thinking of buying I wouldnt wait too long. this can run up very quickly since its so oversoldeven if you dont go all in a nibble here might be a smart move
Sure let’s just spend 4.5 trillion and gold goes down. SMH
Going long here soon. Curious what stocks some of you think might be some good shorts to prepare for when the crash comes?￼
Hedge fund manager Paulson boosted shares in Barrick and Seabridge and bought calls in SPDR gold trust
Gold price goes up 1.7% and this should have been up 4% today. Too many people got shook out.
"You people can't be bearish on gold considering the PE ratio is between 14 and 3. Compared to the broader market S&P average is almost a 39! Or wait is it ""different this time"". Bought Torex, Kirkland and Barrick. We will see who gets the last laugh."
"guys, its going down because commodities are going down. However look at the miners and the oil companies. All very oversold.Its been taken down with the other miners and commodity stocks. This will rebound hard when people realize that commodities are needed and this will get bid up almost as fast as they've been bid down."
Barrick below 20 usd today ! Very sad ! But I have some good news today for Barrick shareholders . Take the long term chart ... As You can see Barrick in 1994 it was worth 20 usd...In 2004 it was worth 20 usd ...In 2014 it was worth 20usd ...so in 2024 it will be worth 20 usd. So there is a lot of raison to be optimistic !
"Gold price is rising, good for Barrick…"
This stock is extremely oversold. Don't sell for a few penny profits. You can get dollar profits
Barrick Gold is still my mist disappointing investment. Just trying to hold on long enough to break even.
Sharp divergence from physical gold and miners. Very weird.
"So much negativity.....smfh. Today’s activity is no different than what happens with many companies these days posting earnings, whether good or bad. Plus gold and silver will rise again!"
"Forget about the interest rates. They won’t be that high because of the enormous debts in the world. High inflation is the best alternative, as long there is trust in dollars. Conclusion: you must be in Barrick for the coming years"
"I got a lot of Thumbs down when I posted that I sold most of my shares when EPD and GOLD were both around $22.50 and moved to EPD well it’s down too, $21.86 today but I just got a .45 dollar distribution to add more and 84 days from now will get another.45 and so on, I still have some GOLD and agree it’s a good price today but I will wait a little longer to average down. We are as I said earlier in for some serious stagflation with for sure already double digit inflation. I am retired but still own one large retail/warehouse building and have a small interest in a furniture operation. In July for example one American manufacturer sent a new price sheet in early July about 15% increase effective July 15th on the 25th they emailed add a 7.5% surcharge. Another factory sent email on July 28th to add 25% to existing price sheet, prices for all companies have been huge. I have not seen this since the seventies, I only post this to recommend buy as much income as you can, heaven knows what’s in store with runaway stupidity inflating everything except stock prices. I certainly believe fixed assets are the place to ride out the storm just make sure enough cash flows with it. Absolutely do not invest on margin.I hope this is of value to someone.My Best John"
"2 months ago gold was 1780, like it is now. Barrick was 21 dollars.This is undervalued, oversold and will catch up. Patience is needed"
"Gold is waiting for the financial melt down, plus the ability to attract Crypto investors."
just bought quite a few shares. liking what i'm seeing. also own physical but these shares are a nice addition. wish me luck and GLTA.
"Premarket was positive and then the matket opened and ""sellllllll gold!!!!"" sells sell selling sell!!!!!!!!"
bought tons of shares today and yesterday. the impatient lose to those with patience. this is a no brainer.
When unvaccinated government employees file for unemployment does gold go up? Does war make gold go up? Does inflation make gold go up? When dividends are at the end of the month GOLD goes up!! Buy now at a discount because big boys are pushing this down to cover short positions and make money on both ends. If you know the stock market you know what I’m talking about. $2000 an ounce in 3 months. Stay calm and buy more. GLTA
I guess spending money on the infrastructure bill will make this go down because it makes no since. Lol
GOLD is moving north slowly but steadily
Oh cool. .23 a share dividend.Oh wait were down like 10 bucks a share in a year.Should have just bought more bitcoin...

"already at .55% up. like i said yesterday, this whole symposium will bring the gold up. :P"
Too Funny...Gold rises $30 yesterday and Barrick rises .50. Today gold falls $2 and Barrick falls .40. Please tell me again how you longs are winning.
"No cheerleading but this stock and gold are so compressed. It will be fun to see the explosion up when they can't manipulate anymore. Solid company with solid balance sheet and market cap. In my opinion, 30 plus in 6-9 months."
"Gold Down 0.03% , and the miners down big. What's going on here? Very puzzling indeed."
"This will be the 5th day in the red. All miners losing about another 5% this week. Meanwhile, gold hasn't moved but a few bucks."
Not sure why Barrick is down today. The earnings yesterday were good if not great. The CC following was very good. Spot Gold is slightly up today or unchanged.
"Income bearing mutual funds will often bid the price up on dividend stocks like Barrick right before ex-div date, so they can pay their annuity clients a dividend, which isn't possible just holding capital gains stocks. This will be in mid $20's by EOW."
