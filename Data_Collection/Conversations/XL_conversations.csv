"Good to see the rapid ""recovery"" but there's still more chip delay to come, and probably another opportunity to buy under six again. Ford is pouring money into the Lightning production after orders have boomed. XL will eventually have its day with commercial fleets."
Solid day today during our ER week. I am excited to see what the ER has to offer.
Anticipating sub $5 share price after next earnings report disappoints. Anyone willing to bet I'm wrong?
"Even if they don’t hit earnings today they are innovating getting ready for the next few years in their company. Also, I don’t see Evs going down anytime soon and I don’t care what anyone says they are going to grow. Especially they have money on hand and creating partnerships that’s what I like to see in an ev right now. Xl in 6 months will be a complete set company to be successful. That’s a fact."
I wasn't expecting anything major from this report and overall I am happy with where we are right now. We are in a great position to continue growth in the long-term.
Going big!!!
Got in at $29 . What should I do??
"So, Muddy Waters is actually out of their short position (been in the news, check out CNBC). Let's start really investing now."

Hello Carson. What you gonna do bubba?
"WOW many of you just don't get it. Hedge funds lost alot of money during the GME, AMC and Wall Street Bets craziness. There are roughly 5 to 7 thousand small cap Tech stocks. The Hedge funds are going to recoup their losses by picking the easiest target.Shorting of the Sector is making Wall Street alot of money. If one would short 1 million shares of XL @7.10 and bought and covered @6.10, that is one million dollars in less than 15 hours. Everyone here doesn't understand that Wall Street does not care what the business does behind the ticker. Wall Street engages in many games. Games that no one on this board can fathom. Wall Street only cares about their pockets. When it is convenient for Wall Street, it will jump back into the Renewables. Wall Street makes and sets the rules to this game and nobody can change that, not even the SEC. Remember Wall Street doesn't care about the enviroment, they care about the cash they can put in there pockets. XL cannot change that"
I had hope that things would be different this time.
"Brian D. If the stock goes up 49%, you’ll break even. This will or won’t happen before the end of the year. I agree with your predictions on the timing. Brian D is a closet short"
6.66.....how devilish
Huh...Nay-sayers are kinda quiet today.... I'm liking this price action.
"Economics, which XL emodies, has a way of eventually winning."
They had some interesting insights about XL on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"18% float steadily shorted, Block holds most. He’s gonna get crushed. Stay strong and buy every dip folks"
I heard about XL the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Do your own Due Diligence...but I am holding on to my shares!XL Fleet partners with NFI’s ARBOC to offer hybrid electric bus option28 July 2021XL Fleet Corp. and ARBOC Specialty Vehicles, a subsidiary of NFI Group Inc., one of the world’s leading independent global bus manufacturers, have announced a partnership to electrify ARBOC Freedom low floor buses with the XL Hybrid (XLH) electric propulsion system.B493E98A-4F40-4BE2-B2EE-D2D478491B44The wheelchair-accessible buses are built on the GM 4500 chassis and are now available for purchase with an installed XL Hybrid system through the ARBOC North American dealer network. ARBOC has sold 39 vehicles with the XL Hybrid system installed thus far in 2021.Through the partnership, 24 ft. and 29 ft. ARBOC low-floor bus models are available for the first time as hybrid electric units, providing a cost-effective option for customers looking to improve fuel economy, lower emissions and advance their sustainability goals without adding charging infrastructure or disrupting their existing operations.The XL Hybrid electric system runs in parallel to the OEM vehicle drivetrain, helping to slow the vehicle down during deceleration and providing an electric assist during acceleration throughout normal drive cycles, reducing fuel consumption and lowering emissions in standard gas-powered vehicles.Individual partners within the ARBOC North American dealer network are now authorized to sell the XL Fleet electrification system as an available option on their buses, providing a new commercial channel for the company as it expands into a broader range of medium duty applications.The bus industry represents a substantial electrification opportunity for XL Fleet, and we are excited to gain access to a great new customer base by partnering with an accessible bus market leader like ARBOC. This partnership allows us to expand our growing suite of products, broaden our customer reach and bring new and unique solutions to market for bus fleets needing an immediate path forward for their sustainability goals.—Dimitri Kazarinoff, CEO of XL FleetPosted on 28 July 2021 in Bus, Conversions, Hybrids | Permalink | Comments (0)"
"XL's core business is a dumpster fire, contributed a little over a million last quarter. The XL grid business contributed 2/3 of the revenue, specifically that recent acquisition. The CEOs excuse list was long...covid delta affecting business, chip shortage, reduced manufacture of new vehicles by automakers--how about existing fleet? Muddy Waters is starting to make sense. Those big name customers they list on their website are not active customers, the improvement in MPG is not worth the upgrade--if it wasn't for the acquisition, revenue numbers would have barely cracked a million."
"Morgan Stanley has about .2% of the float for XL now. That does not mean anything at all. Certainly does not mean the stock will go up. Muddy Waters relinquished their short position, doesn't mean anything either. The utilization of shares short is still high and the fee rate is very low. Someone else will pick up where Muddy Waters left off. No sales for a 12 year old company valued at 750 million in market cap. The reconciliation bill may help as a catalyst, but the vote on that is not for some time. Reality is there will be no short squeeze because the trading volume is low on a daily basis. Everyone here is living a pipe dream and need to wake up and smell the coffee. This company has a long to go before it is worth 15 dollars a share. With no news and more about the chip shortage and the variations of Covid, this will be dead money for at least another 6 months to year. There are better companies out there to invest in."
How did they ever get $400 million in cash?
"expansion of operations and current product offerings - and in turn, an extension of its sales medium- to long-term."
"#XLFLEET investing in growth. Employeegroeth 2,5x since beginning of the year.Has been flying under the radar with PR. News about to make this thing #POP. Can easily start flying towards 20$ again #QUICK. I've been buying and buying and buying and buying and buying and buying and buying and buying this falling knife, so gratefull for this downtrend. Heaven knows this company will prosper with their experience (older then Tesla) and the market demand for fleet electrification."
"Who gets rich with a SPAC. 1The Sponsor or acquisition holdings get very rich.2The Financial House who may be backing the ticker. Both Sponsor and financial backer will get very rich, because they know the real numbers that were inflated grossly. Citadel in this case.3The C Suite or management team of the acquired company, in this case XL has 30% ownership by insiders. They are instant millionaires. The Insider's know how bad the numbers were inflated. Do you think those who exercised warrants at 13.50 to 11.50 are happy. Plus the 1.50 ot so for the warrant. Imagine XL has a 15.00 dollar target for which the exemptions were based on. Well guess what. That was all based on speculation. Now the retail investors that bought this are left holding the bag. XL Management are millionaires regardless of what the stock does.The insiders will be able to sell their shares on December 21 of 2021. All restrictions are removed after a year. Now you know the rest of the story."
"Oh look! Shorts already flagging my posts so they get pulled. Not surprised...If you are new to investing and are looking at XL:(NOTE: I am NOT a financial advisor in any way. Just an investor, like you.)If you're a new or prospective investor in XL (or a discourged Long), shorts would like you to believe the company is going to crash and burn. They have no facts behind their ""This is going to zero, ugh"", ""Company going bankrupt...."", ""Worst investment of my life..."" bullsnot. Here are the FACTS they don't want you to know:1. XL has a partnership to electrify refrigerator trailers with eNow.2. XL has a partnership and contract to turn new busses into hybrids with ARBOC.3. XL is the only electrification option Isuzu has chosen for their ""box trucks"", out of the 5 they've tried.4. XL OWNS World Energy Efficiency, a company that builds...what? Charging stations! Guess what electric and hybrid vehicles are going to need by the 100s of thousands? OH YEAH, WE is already profitable.5. XL has around $400 MILLION in CASH in the bank and less than $500,000 in debt (based on last earnings)The whole goal of shorts is to drive the stock down as low as possible so they can get the shares as cheaply as possible before earnings August 12. Let them drive the price down and then you can buy cheaply...and then..."
"wow people here still believe in this company , wake up people this is going $3 the target price for big short seller , he was on tv, cnbc and wont cover till get his target $3"
"Shorts are low on shares, but unless people BUY, it doesn't matter, and they know it. If you can, buy."
Three days positive. Great base. Outstanding. On our way to $6. My average is $5.33.
Gonna go green AGAIN today very shortly. Just sayin .... seems like something is up!
$XL $VENA 49.27 monthly I think just crossing the value: 50 we're going to get a monthly rise minimum 50-80%.can try it on any stock
What happened to all the pumpers? Gave up pushing this trash company?
"My question is, What is happening with the UBS Arena Charging stations. Is that just smoke and mirrors or is it actually real."

"Violent up-rise occurring these past two days, lets hope it continues tomorrow as well."
"384 million cash on hand, about 1/3 of the marketcap"
Why did I buy this Cramer reject
"Got my contingent order in to buy at less than $5.50. Sadly (but happily at the same time, because I cam buy on the cheap cheap), I think we'll hit that this week. I feel so conflicted...I have 3,300 avg. $8.33, so not happy to see the drop, but at the same time, I want to pick up more on the cheap."
"Maybe XL is about to announce spending some of that $384,000,000???"
"Buy the bargain..and if you can't buy, hold. Don't let the shorts scare you. Got 3,400 shares now and still buying. If you're looking for a quick flip, this isn't it. if you're looking for a longer term investment, this is it."
$WIMI $QS $XL I try to make profitable trades.
How are $XL and $RMO trading at a higher evaluation then $KPLT? $RMO had revenue of under a million. $KPLT was 77 million. And it’s half the market cap. W..T…F… market ?
"I've upgraded the stock, bankruptcy in 5 years rather than 3."

Still waiting for new ATL
"if any analyst downgrade XL , forget it it will go down very very fast to $3 or $2"
This stock is heavily manipulated by the shorts..
Shorts are covering
Doozer…
"Very interesting stock action the last two days here for XL ... this has been a rocket (from the $5.50 crypt) for the last 2 mornings, and it closed very strongly yesterday. Is there a truck order in the works?"
"We're now going to modify the Dodge 2500 and 3500 pickups! Consumer market, here we come! Shorts, really it's time to turn them in and actually invest...or you'll be sorry."
"Got more at $5.59. Now, let's keep going back up!"
"90% of stocks have been up the last 2 days, and the longs here are crowing about a $1.00 gain.It's just getting pulled up with all the beaten down small/mid cap and out of favor EV plays.Nothing to crow about.It's like an 0 and 15 football team claiming they're the champs because they win the last game of the season.Hilarious."
Didn’t take long for analyst downgrades. New all time low coming easily this week
"18 minutes left for this to make another all time low, more than enough time"
I’m loving today’s drop. I am buying another 50 shares. Amazing making money that easy
This stock is heavily manipulated by the longs.It deserves to be much lower.
"I see I had some free time in @Ren & Stimpy s head last night. LOL!I still stand by my statement of six months ago about it not being a $35.00 stock, stumpy...errr...stiffy...err...stubby?? OH, sorry. Stimpy! XL has never been a $35.00 company...not even now. Six months ago, I did get in below $9. Unfortunately, like others, it was probably a little high and I probably should have waited a bit. Oh well. So, you wanted my price takes. Here you go:If XL pulls some contracts, shows increased revenue and growth, $10 or a little higher, EOY.If XL does NOT do the above and their financials do not improve by EOY, then $4.50 to $5.00BTW: I NEVER sell at a loss, unless the company goes belly up. Has served me well so far. The one thing you're wrong on is that I am a short. Have never shorted XL. I've ever only shorted 1 stock and certainly is not XL. TBH, with the run it has had since I got in, I sure wish my decision had been to short it instead. But, hindsight is 20/20. Can't call them all all the time. Thanks for the free time in your head there stinky...err...stingy....sorry, STIMPY. Good luck to you."
Down on a red day. Down on a green day. Consistent. Consistently bad.Why not go down to a $1 tomorrow and save us the wait?
XL has no firm orders right now
"If XL became an OTC stock tomorrow, I would keep holding and buy a #$%$ ton more, because at least as an OTC, the manipulation of the stock price would stop and as an investor I would make money on a great growth company, as should happen. Neutral on the Wall Street traded stock, but full on bullish about XL as a company. Go XL go!"
been down over 40 percent for too long. I know er is coming up but I don't have faith that it will be a good report since it is at market close. I am going to sell at a loss and try to recoup some losses in SYP calls. never had a position that went so bad. I really believed in this company but management did very little to counter the muddy waters report and this was downhill from there.
Wohoo up today LOL still far away from my $6.60 entry
When Will This go to thr 20s again ?
straight facts...ceo needs to get fired immediately he cannot lead or successfully market this company..market up 400pts and this pig gains 5 cents...He tried..He failed..He dirtied his pants and is cooked ..NEXT we need a leader now.
Climbing higher! Soon we get news out of ACT
Anyone surprised by the collusion of the shorts today? I am not.
"Seems to be some confusion about my ""average share price"" and Mr. or Mrs. Stimpy seems to be concerned about it, (maybe to the stalker point, but I really don't care) so thought I'd clear up some confusion. I turn my shares regularly...sell them for a few cents profit when I can and wait to see if they drop and then buy them back cheaper. I don't do that with all my shares of XL, since, like a lot of other people, I bought in higher than I should have on many. Don't really HAVE to explain myself, but don't want newbies to be confused. You buy, and if it goes up a little, you sell, then when it drops...unfortunately with XL that's been the norm lately, you buy back cheaper...THAT's how your average can drop. Anyway, glad it's Friday, and for those who took a beating on PPS as I did today, I feel for you. And yes, I am still an XL cheerleader (even if I'm the only one, as I march to the beat of my OWN drum). I think the COMPANY is good...share price, not so much. Have a great weekend all! I know I will!"
I had a strong feeling we would go up yesterday. I bought at $5.24. Good luck shorts.
"XL has officially set a new low at 5.41today. The 52 week low was 5.42. We still have power hour this afternoon so this will continue to fall. Remember this company had the SEC uptick rule in place up until end of trading yesterday, it is grossly oversold, the fee rate are only 2% to short this. This is blood in the streets and XL has nothing to combat the falling share price."
$7.55 Closing
XL Fleet up 10%? Hmm
the best stock on wall st!!!
If XL ever got good news we all would faint lol
It seems shorts have started covering!! 2500 shares at 7.15
"The longs are trying to manipulate this stock, but they stink at it. J"
If anyone wants to make up some losses from this Ponzi scheme- put some funds into $CLOV. Clover health is going to have another short squeeze. Thank me later ;)
They need a big announcement during the conference call. We still have a 10%downside swing tomorrow if there is no contract announcement.
Is this #$%$ ever going back up?
The way this stock collapses is incredible
Every spac will drop below $10 or even worst $5 go ask $ride $nkla $xl $rmo $hyln
Tomorrow will be brutal
The tax loss selling in this little gem will be vicious and unrelenting in November and December. Many thousands of investors sitting on huge losses……in an Up Market Year.
"Can you imagine the effect of their next earnings release on the stock price? Oh, the horror!"
Is there any evidence of sales?
"Just sold some of mine and made a little money (emphasis on little, but profit is profit). Have my order in for when it dips this afternoon, because it will. Shorts have over 1.3 million shares available at my brokerage. I can play the game too..."
"I'm going to take a wild guess. There is going to be another miniscule non-material small news soon right before earnings. It'll have very little effect, but management trying to deflect from having to speak to the bad earnings coming up. Trust me, mark my words. It be something like, 'XL opens up a 10 charging stations in some obscure God foresaken hicktown in the middle of nowhere."
How does it have a market cap of $800 million and $383 million in cash? Where did all that money come from?
"missed on revenue, better than 0, but not much.Stock going nowhere."
"With two days in a row up, you know that tomorrow we head down."

"Good morning all! OK, here we go. 2 days until earnings. Don't forget:Partnership with Rubicon for trash truck electrificationPartnership with ARBOC for bus electrificationPartnership with eNow for Refrigerator trailer electrificationChosen by Isuzu (OUT OF 5 THEY TRIED) as best for electrification of their cab over trucksBOUGHT World Energy Efficiency, an already profitable company, that makes charging stations.Shorts are going to make a HARD charge for your shares. Buy when they give you the gift of cheap shares and HOLD!"
I would just like to recap our favorite cheerleader and his/her investments in XL while it hits a 52-week low and he is calling $10 by EOY or not $10 by EOY.Little BRIAN D. investing 3 months ago - (Shares=3054) (Average per share=$9.33) (Total invested= $28493.82)2 months agoShares=3200 Average per share=$9.01 Total = $28832Acquired 146 shares at $2.31 per share3 days agoShares=3300 Average per share=$8.33 Total = $27489Acquired 100 shares at -$13.43 per shareHe is stating that he bought 146 shares at $2.31 and someone paid him $13.43 per share to get 100 shares.
Be happy if it just stays green today. No more drama
I hope everyone makes money between them $XL $VENA
"When compared to other EV stocks XL does not make anything. Their systems are manufactured in China. Many of the other EV companies manufacture trucks, vans and cars. Some EV compaies make batteries or components for batteries. There are autonomous vehicle tech and LIDAR. XL has none of that. It has been 12 years XL has been in business, one would think that they would some revenue by now. With a 5 to 6 year ROI there is no point to XL. Ram and GM will have their hybrid trucks in 22 and 23. Buy new get the manufactures warranty instead of XLs 3rd party."
Brian D. What is the low for this stock and what is the high for this stock and when are you predicting the low will happen and the high will happen? That way we can buy low and sell high. Thanks for your wisdom.
Looking for a heavy bet. Debating between below 5 :$WISH$RIDE$RMO$XL$MILE
"There are many players in the electrification and electric fueling station business. The likelihood of xl being a big winner is small. Their best hope is if another company buys them. Almost Zero revenue again for this quarter, most of their revenue came from their recent acquisition."
Hope wallstreet analyst don’t downgrade this at ATL like they did to HYLN today
"No buyers at $6, next stop 5.50"
This is me after investing in XL.
I am so happy to tell that XL is the only green stock in my portfolio today 
Have we all joined the lawsuits? It’s possible we might get something like 20 cents on the dollar. Better than nothing.
calm before the storm.
Time to start tugging on the SEC's ear about the abusive/naked shorting going on with this stock. Good news and we are flat or down again? No. Been compiling data on shorts' actions on XL since I started trading it. Have a call in to the SEC OIG Office to at least get them to look at the data. Anyone want to help with that complaint?

"Expected EPS is -.05 cents, Revenue 4.4 million dollars. If the ER is an earnings beat of miss the implied move up or down for the share price is roughly 15%. Meaning an ER beat we see 8 dollars, if ER is a miss we see 6 dollars basically."
"This is why XL dumped today, not a rosey picture at all.Kazarinoff said auto investors should expect XL Fleet's sales to continue to be limited by the shortage of commercial vehicles into 2022. But, he said, the company is working to expand in other areas, including charging infrastructure, while continuing to develop a fully electric powertrain solution that it expects to bring to market next year."
We are going to start seeing analysts sell call. This mangmemt is tash . Founder last year was on CNBC saying they anticipate 4 billions by 2024 !! What a joke. I dont blame muddy water they figured this scam out and made tons of money out of it.

If you are a real investor, with real DD and real forward thinking, you'll be paid very well. I don't have to have my million tomorrow. I'll just sit back and wait for it. Feel free to sell, I will buy at basement. I bought some at the 52 week low as a quick flip while holding the rest of my investment from $9, made some money on the quick flip and bought more. I will do it again...and again. I have patience. 3,200 avg $8.33 for long term and whatever I can get super cheap for quick flips to buy more for long term. Have fun everyone!"
I wish it reaches a 52-week low so I can buy an additional 50 shares. That would be a great day. Get 'em cheap while you can. LOL
I guess the only way to make money in This stock is to short it
Anyone know why shorts are manipulating this stock again? Amazing how they keep us at these levels instead of letting the stock go up. I'm not surprised. May add more soon at these cheap levels. My reward is coming any day now.
Was in Michigan at took this picture of the XL Fleet Electrification Technology Center in Michigan
"$XL still heading to $10+. You decide. As far as I'm concerned, stock is cheap based on on their most recent earnings. Outlook reduced but just look at their book value. 1000 shares at $6 and will hold until $10+."
What a joke of an earnings call. Unbelievable that this is a publicly traded company.
My average is 16$Will this ever go up to that? Or just sell and move on?
I did a post on LinkedIn where I called out the CEO and Vice President. I wrote a post about how this company is a Ponzi scheme. Getting a lot of attention
"XL Fleet upfits and converts large commercial gas and diesel vehicles into hybrid and plug in hybrid vehicles. Those of us that have been following the EV market for some time realize that this is the right solution right now. Pure EV vehicles that are smaller sedans are just now getting only 300 miles on a full charge. Hybrid vehicles and PHEV's are not limited to the 200-300 mile constraints.XL currently upfits Ford, GM, Dodge (Stellantis), Isuzu, etc...OEM warranties are left intact and gain an XL warranty.An XL upfit can be applied not only to brand new vehicles but also used vehicles as well.XL currently holds 25 patents.XL provides and installs charging stations. XL recently made a strategic move into the refrigeration trailer segment, a multi-billion dollar industry.XL is a growth company in a cyclical industry. They are scaling up their operation and entering into numerous partnerships and acquisitions."
Nice relative strength today
"XL Fleet Corp. (NYSE: XL) (""XL Fleet"" or the ""Company""), a leader in vehicle electrification solutions for commercial and municipal fleets, today announced it is now offering its hybrid electric drive system for Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy duty pickup trucks.XL is the leader? I'd hate to see how the stocks of the others are doing.But seriously... Do we have to wait till the chip shortage is over to see XL prosper? Once they have ample chips, will they have ample business? That's the question."
"oh well, guess shorties have their way again. personally, i think it's a bunch of bullsnot. how often do you have an opportunity to invest in a company that trades sideways for months. what do expect the share price to be. you expect at least same pricing as the original spac? i think that's a bunch of bull pucky. Companies like lordstown, rivian, canoo and workhorse know how to make solid american-made trucks that are next to impossible to get parts for. go invest in those companies and watch your investment trade sideways for months just like the good people at xl."
The year end tax loss selling in this name will be vicious.
Fact is they have $384 million cash. $5million debt. They will spend that money on something
$$5.39 is very low. Should bounce back up from this level.
"Y’all ready for this? 52 week low about to hit … not to worry, Brian is buyin all your shares"

"Weathering the storms and XL is still rolling! Nice green day today!The shorts have thrown everything in their ""play book"" at this stock (allegations of fraud, trumped up lawsuits, paid shorts trolling boards making negative statements, colluding to drive SP down), and yet we keep on. Talk about resilience!Glad I am still holding and have not gotten discouraged. GLTA!"
"Lightning eMotors, Inc. (ZEV) -- same business as XL but actually has an order backlog and makes money. I bet on the wrong horse."
Here are some facts about RMO and why we should see it go much higher. 1. Market cap $650M (was $5.2B!!)2. Cash on hand $267M ( enough for 3yrs without making revenue) while they expect to bring rev in Q3.3. have their own patents + working factury4. 32% held by insiders + 28% held by institutions 5. short % of float around 30%6. cash and revenue should start coming from Lion Electric7. new sharp CEO with impressive resume! 8. production for Paccar long term contract is about to start.IMO the risk reward ratio and current price is laughable and its a strong buy in my opinion. its just too good to be true. I am super bullish! do your own DD.$XL $BLNK $FSR $RIDE
"They actually sold less systems this Q2 than last Q2. See their statement below. Their core business declined for Q2. That is the second quarter that has happened in a row. Apple and Tesla are not using the excuse of a chip shortage. It is poor business management and crisis management that XL is where it is.Revenue totaled $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. Revenue from the sale of drive systems in the second quarter of 2021 totaled $1.3 million compared with $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 due to the microchip shortage and lack of new fleet chassis. Revenue from XL Grid in the second quarter of 2021 totaled $2.4 million, which was comprised of partial-quarter contribution from World Energy following the businesses acquisition on May 17, 2021."

"Couple of nights ago Cramer basically admitted he got XL wrong. XL clearly is not living up to the hype as are many other EV stocks. The whole sector in general has no revenue or news worth anything. XL fell flat on its face right after the merge. Carson Block made both XL and Cramer look follish, and that is well deserved. XL lied on their investor deck. That is clear. No news for 2 months. No revenues worth mentioning. Some 18 of the 33 customers no longer displayed on their website. Remember this company has been around for 12 years and is only as good as their leadership. As of late I have no faith in the current leadership and niether does the market."
An investment MAKES money .. in case you didn't know
"No volume at all today, shame"
Brian D just wants to control the board with his $4.50 to $10 by end of year besucase he did his DD. He’s a closet short
moment of truth on its way after hours. Just believe in the long term outlook and you'll be fine. $XL going to $10 this year.
"You will not get shares much cheaper than where it is now. Maybe it lags lower, but it has way more upside potential and a good entry point for long term investors."
"Everyone here doesn't understand that the market maker's are the one's in charge. News at this moment does not mean anything. When the market maker's see a reason to get back into small cap tech stocks, the market makers will. There are no catylist's until the market decides to create them. The algo's are in charge. The market is never wrong and you cannot fight the market. There are many people behind the market that are a lot smarter than we are. That is reality and the truth."
It wouldn’t surprise me if today we hit a new 52 week low. I guess it is better than a 52 week high since it lets me average down versus making some money. I know those shorts are enjoying this but I am riding this back up to $7 or down to $0.
should rename company to ZV for zero value.
Possible update in the pipe
"What ever happened to the charging stations they were going to install, Looked thru the old news to see whan that was announced but could not find anything, Just a flood of lawsuits, nothing worjt reading"
#$%$ down again. Low volume
"Ahhh, shorties....settle down. Nothing wrong with the company. EVERYTHING wrong with who is running the COUNTRY, making markets and companies nervous. Can't pay people to sit home and not work forever and expect them to go look for jobs, can't plan to tax companies into the ground and expect them to expand.... All markets down. XL will be fine."
Here are some facts about RMO and why we should see it go much higher. 1. Market cap $650M (was $5.2B!!)2. Cash on hand $267M ( enough for 3yrs without making revenue) while they expect to bring rev in Q3.3. have their own patents + working factury4. 32% held by insiders + 28% held by institutions 5. short % of float around 30%6. cash and revenue should start coming from Lion Electric7. new sharp CEO with impressive resume! 8. production for Paccar long term contract is about to start.IMO the risk reward ratio and current price is laughable and its a strong buy in my opinion. its just too good to be true. I am super bullish! do your own DD. $CHPT $BLNK $BE $RIDE $XL
Laughable company
These Blue Sky SPAC stocks are turning out to be real stinkers. Pump and Dumps on a grand scale. The tax loss selling in November and December will be brutal.
Anyone still short this stock deserves what they're gonna get. That's just being a hog at the trough. Infrastructure bill...potential Fleet Mgmt Convention announcements...earnings...prowling WSB guys looking for high short interest... Too many catalysts. COVER NOW...This thing is destined to retest $10.
In for more pain…have a small buy of 1000 shares at $5.27
So glad i made a little $150 profit and exited yesterday phew
The year end tax selling season is coming up. Another SPAC in the nose. Good luck with that.
"Overnight roughly one million shares less available to short. Expectations are an ER miss when XL reports in Q3 in a month. There has been no news for 40 days, let's face it there is nothing positive about XL. It is obvious this company, which has existed for 12 years prior to going public is a garbage SPAC. Poor leadership, no revenues and is still overvalued with a price to book of 2 and a market cap of 770 million. This stock is only worth the cash and cash equivalents on hand. That makes it roughly a 3 dollar stock."
"XL earnings in a few days should catapult this stock into the $10+ range. Standby, load up and GLTA cuz we are overdo!"
500 shares at 20 bucks
Maybe we should sell before it goes to zero.
I sold a month ago when shares dropped below 6.00. Short interest has only dropped from 17 million shares to 14 million shares. I don't think xl is likely to drop much more so why is there still such a large short interest at this point? It seems likely that xl will just trade sideways for a while until chip shortage starts to recover. Aren't holders risking a huge short squeeze at this point?
Buy more
"At this level I'm almost a buyer, buy order for$6.01"
XL Fleet 2022
"$WIMI $XL A patient long-term investor that really believed in its future could just put money in at any of the ""reasonable"" points and then ignore all the up and down."
Sold at a great loss today...but at $6.53. I did buy calls to see if I can make my way back slowly...slow...ly...since it came down so fast. I bought some December calls to give me some time. GLTA
$xl $rmo $nkla $ride $vldr welcome $sklz to become $10 spac stocks! Bag holder !!
what makes XL up?
When shorts aren’t selling short volume remains low. Should be interesting week
At the end of the day this stock is fundamentally cheap! Looks like rotation into high growth is starting...
Im so glad I bought more when it got beat down to bring my average down. I’m now even with 2000 shares.
Tax loss selling in about 2 months. Earnings will be a miss and the revised guidance will be missed. Short shares are still utilised 80 percent. No news or volume. BYD sold 6 electric garbage trucks to a company right in XLs back yard. Clearly this company is a massive dissappointment.
I will be filing a class action lawsuit against the XL longs for non support. They promised to end the downward manipulation and increase the price with their own manipulation. They have not done as they promise and now they will feel the lawyers wrath.
looks like we going to see $5 today
Company is not worth its market cap @nd is still over valued. Yoatal asset as per ER shows 424 million. Therefore on paper the share price is 3 dollars and change.
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
XL is in a sweet spot .The new mpg is going up this year dealers have no inventory of fleet trucks or cars emissions must be meet . I like this set up for XL FLEET CORP....
The XL pumpers are pretty #$%$ even as pumpers.Up 40 cents and they think they're out of the woods. Not by a long shot.
"You think XL will do $10million in revenue this year? Lightning motors has a superior product to XL's, this is K-mart and they are Walmart. Management too concerned about compensation & not improving their current product."
"Brian D. You should buy low. None of this average down stuff. Just buy at the lowest point and don’t waste your time with the rest, my closet short."
$XL doubling by year end. Mark my words!!!
Old Carson Block better come up with his exit strategy soon himself lmao. I sure as hello wouldn’t want to be short 23 million shares today
"Recent weather events should probably show utilities, city, and county services not to invest in 100% EV trucks, since the power does go down for everyone. XL's only move (imo) is to get a huge marketing and sales team going while the chip shortage continues possibly into 2023 as some have reported. This stock will stink for a couple years. Chip shortage has been the reason for lagging sales in the past earning calls and will continue to be in the next. When the sp gets whack down below 6, I'll be buying again, since there's 300+ million in XLs bank and a possibility management might make a smart buy or move."
"Still holding 1,000 share order at $5.90....or less....."
Huh....anyone surprised by the collusion of the shorts today? I am not.
Without news or contracts this is dead money to the markets makers. ZEV maybe a better investment at this point.
Expect $6 to $7 near term.
"$MU $XL $WIMI Not sure why everyone is excited for tomorrow lol. I'm excited for Wednesday though. If you know, you know"
$XL will be $10+ by year end unless we don’t recover from this much needed correction we just had. Mark my words. In for 1000 shares
XL has 400 million cash on hand. Furthest thing from bankrupt
"Soo, I see a lot of negative posts by, presumably shorts. But, if they're by actual investors, HOLD ON! DON'T give the shorts your shares. That is exactly what they want you to do. Mark my words, before August 12, XL WILL go lower. If you can buy, buy on the dips. Then, hold and reap the rewards. I know there are a lot of you holding from WAY higher than I am, and you're frustrated. I get it. Hold on...you will be rewarded."
Morgan Stanley on the board - have bought 364K shares !https://fintel.io/so/us/xl
Do some studying on the XL Fleet Electrification Technology Center in Michigan. Big things coming. Can XL double in price?!?
I tagged the SEC in a post about XL on LinkedIn. I’m tired of watching people on this board get taken advantage of. Too many good people here. Cheers all
American company with high potential
Chart is now broken. Will close the year in the low 4’s.
$8.00 Plus after hours.....
I think I’ll add 500 here $5.78
"Got my buy of another 1,000 set at $5.90...."
Also have no debt
"2.5 x revenue vs Q 1 and yet it goes down? At this rate, it would take 50 years for BK. Without a doubt the shorts are in control, but that will change. Give it time…."
"Up on a down day, I must be sick"
"This is heading to 5 dollars, that is a psychological support. There is no other support except for 4 dollars then 3 dollars psychological. Setting new all time lows continuously the shorts have been making hundreds of millions of dollars. All those hedge funds that lost a fortune with the AMC and GME, are getting even. Again there is no news, there is no short squeeze and XL like the rest of the sector is in trouble. XL has a total assets of 424 million with 385 million as cash and cash equivalents. Meaning the business before going public was worth 40 million legitimately before going public. A market cap of 730 million now. XL had no business going public. Management is still running this as a private company, and there lies the problem. Wall street knows what is going on behind the scenes. There is only 300K shares available to short, so low volume with 18 to 19 million shares total held short. Wall street doesn't care about the planet, they only care about wall Street."
I have a buy for 10 more December $5 calls at $1.15. Trying to average down my calls from $1.50.
I sold at $5.68 today.
"52 week low - now I'm really thinking of adding another 50 shares. The more it falls, the happier I get. Thank you shorts and week hands. I keep taking your candy for free."
"People are trying way to hard to pump XL. As if their pumps have an effect on the share price. People claim there will be a short squeeze, that will not happen and rarely happens. As per XL's own guidance earnings will be negligible. DO NOT mistaken partnerships for contracts. Contracts add value to a companies bottom line, partnership's only lead to to one partner disappointing the other. XL is not going to run up just because of earnings. The only thing that brings value are contracts like ZEV's contract with Forest River a Warren Buffet backed company. XL has been around 12 years and still has nothing of substance. This was a SPAC that as not ready to go public, and it shows today still. Also we now know where DHL landed, XL showed that DHL was a client of their's, but, now we know that is not true. DHL is working with ZEV. Truth hurts."
is anyone buying or adding to their positkon?
"So ... Just to show that BRIAN D is not telling the truth at all....yesterday he wrote:""Got my contingent order in to buy at less than $5.50. Sadly (but happily at the same time, because I cam buy on the cheap cheap), I think we'll hit that this week. I feel so conflicted...I have 3,300 avg. $8.33, so not happy to see the drop, but at the same time, I want to pick up more on the cheap.""so $27,489 money...3,330 shares at $8.333 months ago the genius wrote:""So, I'm in 3054 shares at 9.33. How about everyone else?""so $28,489 money...3,054 shares at $9.33SO HE INVESTED MORE MONEY SO THAT THE MONEY HE PUT IN WENT FROM $28,489 TO $27,489. (WHAT???)This means that to average down, BRIAN D. GOT 246 shares at -$4.08. Someone gave hime 246 shares and paid him $4.08 to take the shares. That is how you get to 3,300 shares at $8.33 (WHAT???)So he got more shares but his out of pocket money went down...Amazing the lies he tells and he is an investor.WOW he is full of it. And today he bought more at negative prices again? Talk about manipulation.Brian D. you lie little one...you are full of it.You are a closet short. Wow getting caught as a great investor. Now I see how you have never lost money; you fool yourself. My little child...my closet short."
"Next week could be really good. I’m excited. Up 18% for the week, not to shabby"
Disgusted with this company!
Brian D is the last bull standing maybe xl fleet gets bought out and he becomes rich
Interesting move today with XL. Jumping nearly 10 percent today but with average or low volume. I am sure we will see low $6 range again.
ZEV Just announced an 850 million dollar deal with Forest River. ZEV is a fleet electrification company. It hasn't been around as long as XL. XL will get a lift by ZEV;s news.
SPAC Shareholder Sues Over Loss On $1B XL Fleet Mergerhttps://www.law360.com/assetmanagement/articles/1423733/spac-shareholder-sues-over-loss-on-1b-xl-fleet-merger
"This is a very good lineup, if it can be maintained$WIMI $GOOG $XL"
"Referring to this excerpt from an Aug 13, 2021 Motley Fool article:Kazarinoff said auto investors should expect XL Fleet's sales to continue to be limited by the shortage of commercial vehicles into 2022. But, he said, the company is working to expand in other areas, including charging infrastructure, while continuing to develop a fully electric powertrain solution that it expects to bring to market next year.Q1: In the case of a private vehicle owner, do you think converting an ICE vehicle to an EV will ever be an economically viable alternative to buying a new EV?Q2: If the answer to Q1 is YES, do you think XL could expand into that 'consumer segment' of the car market?"
"I would suggest, remove the complete board including CEO (Dimitri Kazarinoff) and replace it with Adam Aron of AMC as their new CEO. This stock will fly. Management is doing a terrible job! And, sue BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis (RPOS)!"
"any slackers out there need a sales job where you don't have to produce & can blame everything on the ""chip shortage""...then XL has a job for you. I don't see tesla suffering a ""chip shortage"""
"Wow, it's up 10 cents, it's flying now, buy more, woohoo all you longs are going to be rich."
$hyln $nkla $ride $xl $rmo $sklz These companies should just sell tshirt “to the moon” probably help stocks price !
