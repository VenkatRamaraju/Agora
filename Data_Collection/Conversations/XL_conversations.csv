According to last financials the Total assets almost 424 million dollars. Of which 384 million is cash and cash equivelants. Meaning that the enterprise value was 40 million when this went public. NO way is this a 20 dollar stock. The SPAC group ripped off the retail investors immensely lying about XLs potential.
Can’t believe it’s actually in the green
I'm about $4400 down on this stock and its 70% down from the initial investment. Can anyone tell me what this company does different then GM or Ford with there upcoming electric pickups? This business model seems dead to me since the OEM's are doing it them selves. Please help me understand.??
Wow. We are really moving up. 
"umm.. I bought it in Jan and it was $19 Can't see the future of XL, should I sell it or holding it till I die lol"
"From tip ranks about XL. Recent article from yesterday.XL Fleet tells investors that its vehicle charging solutions unit, XL Grid, is subject to numerous regulations related to health and safety. It cautions that complying with the complex regulations could increase its expenses and adversely impact its business and financial condition. It goes on to warn that failing to comply with the regulations could result in fines or orders to stop certain projects.The company hires subcontractors to work on certain XL Grid projects. It warns that if the subcontractors are unable to deliver on their commitments, there could be project delays. It goes on to say that delays in project delivery could damage its reputation, strain the relationships with customers, and derail its growth.Sorry link will not post on here."
"The only thing that will help, will be the corporate welfare of the infastructure bills. That is only if the Green energy portion remains intact. There is zero incentive to convert an ICE to Hybrid or PHEV. The rebates are for new vehicles that are made in America and with union employees. There is nothing specific about up fitting. a vehicle and receiving rebates. As far as a business expense, I can write off 100% the fuel usage for that year, no matter how much is consumed. As for an up fit you have 5 years for asset depreciation. On even a 2 or 3 year old vehicle that will take me 6 years roughly to get my return on investment, and only 5 years of asset depreciation. This makes no sense at all. That 12 to 13K could be used for a down payment on a new EV. That is why nobody is jumping on board XL's idea."
Sorry guys. I had to do it. I just took at loss at 67% and got out of it completely after the suffering for so long since i bought it around 20$. Good luck to those still holding it. Been dead money for me for too long and I’ll just have to learn from it and invest the left over elsewhere that’d grow quicker.
My average is 16$Will this ever go up to that? Or just sell and move on?
Bill voting delayed and XL filed notice of effectiveness today with SEC.
This stock is heavily shorted and will not move. No short squeeze or interest in XL.
Doubled position earlier today
We need good news from management. Is there anything?
Once again: I told you so!
New UBS arena is scheduled to open in November for the 21-22 hockey season. Has there been any indication that XL has followed thru with the 1000 charging stations they initially said were going to be installed at this location?
Whitepaper is out. Seems legit!https://www.xlfleet.com/assets/White-Paper/AF06-21-10752-XLFleet-Electrification-WP.pdf
500 shares at 20 bucks
I expect XL to miss earnings expectations yet again. I have that feeling from my past experiences with XL.
"@johndwashington when you state the following, you think the company has no future with a ‘worthless’ stock. Here are your thoughts on xl :“I think the window of opportunity is closing for $XL Its not a sustainable business. Once charging infrastructure is widespread (and theyre building fast!) fleets will turn full electric, lots of incentives to buy new full electric. $XL will lose all business.As a fleet owner, would you transform your existing old fleet? Or just sell it and buy futureproof full electric fleets with the latest tech.Basically, $XL just sticks chinese parts on old ICE fleet vehicles, making them heavier and in need of more maintenance.”So you think the stock will go down!"
XL Fleet is up 7.07% to 5.59
