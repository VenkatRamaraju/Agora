"Now we are moving , hopefully tomorrow we trade there ..."
"Terrific qtr, and even better guidance...software growth exploding"
I am buying. Anyone else?
Good company with great products. Biggest problem it can only grow in single digits.
At what price do you think FFIV starts getting interest from outside buyers? It's definitely on the cheaper side of it's historical valuation. $1B in cash... hmm
"This is very sudden ...no news ...volume up , computer driven ?"
what happened today?? by graphics and fundamentals it seems to be perfect
"What in the world is going on with this today....stock is very cheap....great balance sheet and earnings...can't figure out the drop in the up market today..... Yes, other software companies are not up very much to flat, but none are down like this"
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
Beautiful
Cheapest growth stock
We are 27.5 % away from the high ...due for a nice move tonight or further pain ?
Reaction is bizarre in selling down to April levels
People chasing APPLE with a PE of 30 and these guys have a forward PE in the low to mid teens
Not good results...not terrible....guided DOWN for EPS by $.20 or so....Revenues up....however that is because they are including the acquisition of Shape....which is helping with Revenues but lower GM it appears....
Getting trashed. I'd buy more but it will just drop more so I will not do that to others.
Hasn't had an up day in over a week. Trading near April levels. Who is gonna buy them?
Probably the worst stock I ever owned now trading at an incredible discount.
$160 in March easy.
Nice earnings report that beat estimates. Should go to 250.00 in the near future.
"Enjoy being part of Elliot Management. If you work at F5 update your resume quickly, it won't be long before the slash and burn begins."
"Needham boosted the price target for F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) from $170 to $180"
"Net Income boosted by favorable tax rate, otherwise they likely would have missed. Product revenue also lower YoY. What a disaster.."
Much better call than six months ago. More organized presentation; better answers to questions. CEO is learning to live with his capital partners. It helps when 84% gross margins allows $500 mil of buybacks. Cyberattacks or fear of will continue to help drive business. Fed biz strong for Q4?
this was a good report and guidance--a cash cow--growth picking up w shape---i like it here on this super low volume dip AH
Revenue next quarter higher than expected!! Stock is down 30% from all time high the selloff is ridiculous
Anyone listen in or read the conference call transcript? CEO didn’t answer a lot of analyst questions? Lack of transparency not good. Is he the right guy? New board members from activist fund may determine quickly.
Numbers are out ...
Just bought in today.
Wow! At least $135 tomorrow. Beats and guides higher. Guidance is $605M vs. $592M ... That is a robust $13M more revenues.
Any ER predictions?
IPO price level almost here!! Revenue at over $2 billion per year and market cap barely above $8 billion
F5 Networks is up 12.93% to 147.85
What’s going on with this one today? High volume
F5 Networks is up 5.84% to 215.80
Great Q and barely up after hours
Interesting at this price given it is trading more than $40 to $50 below most price targets. Wonder if we will see consolidation with a buyer coming in?
"On the surface, I really like the NGINX acquisition. Together, they have an extremely competitive product... Lot's of synergies. The company is quite cheap in comparison to it's industry peers."
"It seems there is a floor here around $165-$166 that we tested a few times in the last two weeks , I added today going into earning ..."
Bought more..ty for selling a gr8 report to me at 7% off
