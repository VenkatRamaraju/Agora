"Prices continue to soar:Prices continue to move upUS Low Vol A 255 $US High Vol A 212 $US High Vol B 177Australian Premium HCC 227$ The recent dip is your last/best chance to get cheap shares before $40. US steel RFPs for met coal due monday, $140 is the bottom, might be higher. Rising prices may get steel producers to lock in earlier since nothing stopping the march upward on pricing. Could have 2022 profits of $500+million (@ $140 per ton realized) vs a market cap of $625 million. Profits might even be higher, given realized would be landing at $145-150 at current pricing. If you want to make money, buy this stock. I added more @ $33 on the downturn, you should too."

"CTRA is finally past a horrendous 2019 that had the another company's bankruptcy cost them ~$100 million (blackjewel), a sharp drop in Met coal pricing, their CEO leave (good thing long term), and a questionable merger with Alpha that burdened them with thermal coal assets. I expect a significantly improved 2020, with a substantial rebuild of their cash pile, a restart of the stock buyback problem, and a bounce back in share price."
no one seems to know the difference between thermal coal and metallurgical coal. Everyone is dumping highly profitable CTRA and HCC due to a bankruptcy at Black Jewel...go figure. All while CTRA is about to pay out a $250M dividend to shareholders.
if this thing drops below $32 im going in heavy
"Pricing continues to soar shattering all time highs every day.US east coastLow Vol A: $405High Vol A: $350High Vol B: $257Australia:Premium fob DBCT: $380Regular fob DBCT: $308 China deliveries (cfr) are north of $500 per ton. Remember that AMR reports costs of $72-75 per ton. Even with increased capex, overhead, interest, taxes, etc. all in costs are just around $100 per ton. EPS per Q in 2022 will be in the double digits."

Volume should pick up once details of the merger arise. Humpty Dumpty has been put back together!
"Good Evening Gents! Met coal prices continue to be at all time highs listings below:US East CoastLow vol A:$488.40High vol A:$385High vol B:$290Aussie/ChinaCFR Jingtang Premium:$603.28FOB DBCT Premium:$395.98 Contract negotiations continue & so far the pricing environment will force even the cheapest to the table sooner than later. Word is that many want 6 month contracts to try and ride out current pricing, that might drive some panicked buyers halfway through 2022 if true. Coal miners are in the cat's bird seat, going to be very interesting to sell how this all shakes out. Either way AMR will be raking in the dough! We are looking at possibly $80 by Christmas. Each day this pricing holds, the more locked in we will be for next year. In addition, new Q3 estimate came out predicting $2.81 EPS. That would be great and will definitely get more eyes on this stock! Float is only 18 million shares so its quite low, increased interest could shoot us up very quickly."

Very strong leverage to any met coal price increases and with steel at all time highs, I expect met coal to have a strong 2021."

I bought 300 shares at 3.25. I just sold 100 at $23. This was one of my first buys and my first sale ever. I have mix feelings...that haunting “What if it goes up to $30” feeling.
With a valuation of 4 times the current price this could have good recovery moving into 2020.

"Good morning all! A quick update given the craziness in the thermal coal market & the headlines. Pricing remains stable or a bit higher than I posted previously. High vol B (US east coast) is up to $315. NOTHING has changed materially for AMR's business. If anything, the continued elevated pricing is giving AMR more & more leverage in squaring up the 2022 contracts. Expect some great color during AMR's Conference call but the real jump will begin when Arch Coal reports on 10/26 and shows a huge jump in met coal pricing."

Stock consolidating after huge move up in past 6 months. Earnings report in August will be the next catalyst when they announce how much more new contract pricing is going for. Still has 2-3x of upside when announced. Cash costs to produce are $70-75 per ton & overhead+capex is another ~$25 per ton. They were at $85 per ton realized pricing last quarter. New contracts should be $130+. $30 margin per ton at 13+ million tons is almost $400 million in profit! Market cap is $440 million. Buy buy buy.

These coal miners certainly keep you on ur toes. What a range today until retreating to it’s comfort level of $62s. Being the entire coal miners were down and the energy stocks too. Well it’s still October and it’s only going to get colder. With coal at $234 AMR is signing profitable contracts. Sticking with the girl I brought to the dance

"Broke $30 and stayed there today as I said before. Not the best quarterly report since the Aussie index killed them for Q2 but they are looking at a 70% increase in revenue with minimal cost increases coming up. They are getting $140 per ton vs $83 for Q2 now & are locking in contract at or above that value. Also, they are selling more into China with its CFR $320 per ton pricing. They expect 1 million tons this year & that might increase. This is going over $60 within 6 months."

"Disastrous year for CTRA with terrible mitigation of costs during the MET coal down turn. I could have run this company better than the bozos who left before the coal hit the fan. If they can get costs under control, they might limit losses and even eke out a few pennies profit. They bought $32M in shares at $31.73 / share. Buybacks for this company are even more disastrous. I would rather see investors get a special dividend, or hold the money to help save this wounded bird."

I think they should stop the growth projects ASAP and shore up the balance sheet. Cash burn is a problem. Investors are now penciling out the math on whether they can avoid bankruptcy. New mines almost always have problems when they start out. This isn't the time to layer on operational risk and spend their remaining cash.

"For some reason I decided to check in on ""Contura"", the skeletal remains of the once proud and mighty Pittston Coal. After the transition to ""Alpha"" (now there's a joke in and of itself - it should have been named ""Zed"" or ""Nul""), the thugs from VT and their minions took over pocketing what they could until there was nothing left of means and bankrupted the company. Once buried, the RICO brothers raised Lazarus from the dead and called it ""Contura""...., the name implies changes in elevation, i.e., like the stock price plummeting from the heights (hypes) of imagined realism to the depths of dis-pear. Then I read where Con-tura, nine months ago, let go its two senior executive attorneys, Ms. Moore and Ms. Harrison, two highly ethical women who I had the professional opportunity to work with for two decades. Contura then replaces them with a guy from ICG and Massie......, I won't even go there, LOL. Hey, I'm not a bitter ex-employee, I left ""Zed"" when I saw the incompetence, nepotism and graffiti on the wall. ""Run Forrest, Run!"""
