"Q4 numbers aren't good but the guidance looks very positive. ~50% of production locked in at $85.47 per ton, a 10% increase over Q4 2020 and with spot prices higher than that. Very strong leverage to any met coal price increases and with steel at all time highs, I expect met coal to have a strong 2021."

US steel RFPs for met coal due monday, $140 is the bottom, might be higher. Rising prices may get steel producers to lock in earlier since nothing stopping the march upward on pricing. Could have 2022 profits of $500+million (@ $140 per ton realized) vs a market cap of $625 million. Profits might even be higher, given realized would be landing at $145-150 at current pricing. If you want to make money, buy this stock. I added more @ $33 on the downturn, you should too."

"Wow, read call transcript. Gotta spend over $100 million on Cumberland and it doesn't seem to cash flow. Only $40 to $50 million of unrestricted cash currently. Lots of promises for future. IMO, this thing is about done, again!"

I bought 300 shares at 3.25. I just sold 100 at $23. This was one of my first buys and my first sale ever. I have mix feelings...that haunting “What if it goes up to $30” feeling.

I think they should stop the growth projects ASAP and shore up the balance sheet. Cash burn is a problem. Investors are now penciling out the math on whether they can avoid bankruptcy. New mines almost always have problems when they start out. This isn't the time to layer on operational risk and spend their remaining cash.

"For some reason I decided to check in on ""Contura"", the skeletal remains of the once proud and mighty Pittston Coal. After the transition to ""Alpha"" (now there's a joke in and of itself - it should have been named ""Zed"" or ""Nul""), the thugs from VT and their minions took over pocketing what they could until there was nothing left of means and bankrupted the company. Once buried, the RICO brothers raised Lazarus from the dead and called it ""Contura""...., the name implies changes in elevation, i.e., like the stock price plummeting from the heights (hypes) of imagined realism to the depths of dis-pear. Then I read where Con-tura, nine months ago, let go its two senior executive attorneys, Ms. Moore and Ms. Harrison, two highly ethical women who I had the professional opportunity to work with for two decades. Contura then replaces them with a guy from ICG and Massie......, I won't even go there, LOL. Hey, I'm not a bitter ex-employee, I left ""Zed"" when I saw the incompetence, nepotism and graffiti on the wall. ""Run Forrest, Run!"""

"wow, this company is priced for bankruptcy? It has debt worth many times more than its market cap?"
Stock consolidating after huge move up in past 6 months. Earnings report in August will be the next catalyst when they announce how much more new contract pricing is going for. Still has 2-3x of upside when announced. Cash costs to produce are $70-75 per ton & overhead+capex is another ~$25 per ton. They were at $85 per ton realized pricing last quarter. New contracts should be $130+. $30 margin per ton at 13+ million tons is almost $400 million in profit! Market cap is $440 million. Buy buy buy.
Volume should pick up once details of the merger arise. Humpty Dumpty has been put back together!
"Disastrous year for CTRA with terrible mitigation of costs during the MET coal down turn. I could have run this company better than the bozos who left before the coal hit the fan. If they can get costs under control, they might limit losses and even eke out a few pennies profit. They bought $32M in shares at $31.73 / share. Buybacks for this company are even more disastrous. I would rather see investors get a special dividend, or hold the money to help save this wounded bird."

Big dividend coming. $250M is being paid back to investors in 2019-2020 in dividends and/or buybacks now that the new $570M financing is in place. Should be announced soon. They telegraphed this in the last quarterly report.

Launch in T minus 9 days and counting. Q2 will beat & the report about how much pricing has moved up for 2022 contracts will propel this baby to $30 maybe even above $40.
That can’t be real
CTRA reached an all time low at 6.91
"Broke $30 and stayed there today as I said before. Not the best quarterly report since the Aussie index killed them for Q2 but they are looking at a 70% increase in revenue with minimal cost increases coming up. They are getting $140 per ton vs $83 for Q2 now & are locking in contract at or above that value. Also, they are selling more into China with its CFR $320 per ton pricing. They expect 1 million tons this year & that might increase. This is going over $60 within 6 months."

With a valuation of 4 times the current price this could have good recovery moving into 2020.
Very strong uptrend!
"Man I hope this company starts to do very well. I am a small business owner and my company does ALOT of work for contura, we have done work for them for around 15-20 years back in the good old coal days when it was ANR. People and their ignorant brainwashed ideas of global warming will wake up one day if the world is foolish enough to ever try and kick fossil fuels. It’s not possible people and you’re being lied to about global warming. Please actually do your research and not just believe what you watch on tv or hear on the radio. GLTA"

"CTRA is finally past a horrendous 2019 that had the another company's bankruptcy cost them ~$100 million (blackjewel), a sharp drop in Met coal pricing, their CEO leave (good thing long term), and a questionable merger with Alpha that burdened them with thermal coal assets. I expect a significantly improved 2020, with a substantial rebuild of their cash pile, a restart of the stock buyback problem, and a bounce back in share price."
Half the upper management team leaves all at once! Continues downward trend. May get below $20 before earnings. Does it end up in the $10-13 range with most of the rest after earnings?
