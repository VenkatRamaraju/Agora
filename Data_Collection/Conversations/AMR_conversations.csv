Any reason why this got crushed from a high of 66
"Solidly over 50 now. Easy 80 target over the next few weeks/months. Market cap is less than 1x 2022 projected FCF. Even if 3x were a fair value, this should be 150 in 2022"
Alpha Metallurgical Resources is down 7.72% to 61.12
"Good morning all! A quick update given the craziness in the thermal coal market & the headlines. Pricing remains stable or a bit higher than I posted previously. High vol B (US east coast) is up to $315. NOTHING has changed materially for AMR's business. If anything, the continued elevated pricing is giving AMR more & more leverage in squaring up the 2022 contracts. Expect some great color during AMR's Conference call but the real jump will begin when Arch Coal reports on 10/26 and shows a huge jump in met coal pricing."
These coal miners certainly keep you on ur toes. What a range today until retreating to it’s comfort level of $62s. Being the entire coal miners were down and the energy stocks too. Well it’s still October and it’s only going to get colder. With coal at $234 AMR is signing profitable contracts. Sticking with the girl I brought to the dance
"After careful analysis of today's activity, in summary.... BOOM!!! Let's eat!"
"Yahoo will not allow links so I will copy and past part of this story... China Energy Crunch Triggers Shutdowns, Pleas for More Coal China faces mounting pressure to ramp up coal imports and ensure supplies to keep lights on, factories open and water flowing as a severe power crunch roils the northeastern industrial heartland.With electricity shortages sparked by coal shortages crippling large sections of industry, the governor of Jilin province, one of the hardest hit in the world's no.2 economy, called for a surge in coal imports, while a power company association said supply was being expanded ""at any cost.""News organizations and social media carried reports and posts saying the lack of power in the northeast had shut down traffic lights, residential elevators and 3G mobile phone coverage as well as triggering factory shutdowns.|"
Wow a $60 print early am. So that’s what’s on the other side of $56
$150/sh is the minimum fair value. Stock trading at 60% discount to fair value. Just do the FCF calculation for 2022. Period!
"AC & Daniel These high prices and increased uncertainty are not helping the stock. We need met coal prices in the sweet spot around usd $180. I am not from this industry nor do I know much, we need TPB Boxers viewpoint on this."

"Pricing continues to soar shattering all time highs every day.US east coastLow Vol A: $405High Vol A: $350High Vol B: $257Australia:Premium fob DBCT: $380Regular fob DBCT: $308 China deliveries (cfr) are north of $500 per ton. Remember that AMR reports costs of $72-75 per ton. Even with increased capex, overhead, interest, taxes, etc. all in costs are just around $100 per ton. EPS per Q in 2022 will be in the double digits."
Alpha Metallurgical Resources reached an all time high at 66.75
"Good Evening Gents! Met coal prices continue to be at all time highs listings below:US East CoastLow vol A:$488.40High vol A:$385High vol B:$290Aussie/ChinaCFR Jingtang Premium:$603.28FOB DBCT Premium:$395.98 Contract negotiations continue & so far the pricing environment will force even the cheapest to the table sooner than later. Word is that many want 6 month contracts to try and ride out current pricing, that might drive some panicked buyers halfway through 2022 if true. Coal miners are in the cat's bird seat, going to be very interesting to sell how this all shakes out. Either way AMR will be raking in the dough! We are looking at possibly $80 by Christmas. Each day this pricing holds, the more locked in we will be for next year. In addition, new Q3 estimate came out predicting $2.81 EPS. That would be great and will definitely get more eyes on this stock! Float is only 18 million shares so its quite low, increased interest could shoot us up very quickly."
"whats happening, most coal stocks are tanking off-late 2 weeks or so ?"
"taken from twitter (https://twitter.com/S_Nyyssonen/status/1453062667778859011). Any comment on this:""For 2021, Alpha has committed and priced approximately 79% of its metallurgical coal within the Met segment at an average price of $89.78 per ton and 98% of thermal coal in the Met segment at an average expected price of $52.68 per ton""from https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18426299-alpha-announces-second-quarter-2021-results"
"3:39pm, eastern... per business insider... +7.22%, 234!"
"Listening to ARCH's CC and they are locking in $230 per ton for US Domestic!!!! For the export market, they are averaging $300 per ton for their high vol A currently, the values are insane. Similar pricing would have $AMR with a P/E under 1 and generating $20+ EPS per month! Awesome news for all coal miners, great to hear $230 is locked in!"
"Coal pricing has gone parabolic in the past month or so, looking at EPS around $80 for 2022 with current pricing. I doubt it will be that high but going to break $100 by Christmas should pricing stay near this level. Aussie Premium fob DBCT: $306US east low vol A: $300US east high vol A: $270Us east high vol B: $235China Jingtang premium cfr: $476 Looking at realized pricing above $200, margins in the 100s. Q3 2021 should see positive EPS, Q4 more so, and Q1 2022 EPS in the $15-20 range."
What just happened today?
