With a valuation of 4 times the current price this could have good recovery moving into 2020.

"Good Evening Gents! Met coal prices continue to be at all time highs listings below:US East CoastLow vol A:$488.40High vol A:$385High vol B:$290Aussie/ChinaCFR Jingtang Premium:$603.28FOB DBCT Premium:$395.98 Contract negotiations continue & so far the pricing environment will force even the cheapest to the table sooner than later. Word is that many want 6 month contracts to try and ride out current pricing, that might drive some panicked buyers halfway through 2022 if true. Coal miners are in the cat's bird seat, going to be very interesting to sell how this all shakes out. Either way AMR will be raking in the dough! We are looking at possibly $80 by Christmas. Each day this pricing holds, the more locked in we will be for next year. In addition, new Q3 estimate came out predicting $2.81 EPS. That would be great and will definitely get more eyes on this stock! Float is only 18 million shares so its quite low, increased interest could shoot us up very quickly."

China Trade Agreement. The details are trickling out. China has agreed to buy $52 billion of energy products from the U.S. including coal. This could be HUGE.
no one seems to know the difference between thermal coal and metallurgical coal. Everyone is dumping highly profitable CTRA and HCC due to a bankruptcy at Black Jewel...go figure. All while CTRA is about to pay out a $250M dividend to shareholders.

"For some reason I decided to check in on ""Contura"", the skeletal remains of the once proud and mighty Pittston Coal. After the transition to ""Alpha"" (now there's a joke in and of itself - it should have been named ""Zed"" or ""Nul""), the thugs from VT and their minions took over pocketing what they could until there was nothing left of means and bankrupted the company. Once buried, the RICO brothers raised Lazarus from the dead and called it ""Contura""...., the name implies changes in elevation, i.e., like the stock price plummeting from the heights (hypes) of imagined realism to the depths of dis-pear. Then I read where Con-tura, nine months ago, let go its two senior executive attorneys, Ms. Moore and Ms. Harrison, two highly ethical women who I had the professional opportunity to work with for two decades. Contura then replaces them with a guy from ICG and Massie......, I won't even go there, LOL. Hey, I'm not a bitter ex-employee, I left ""Zed"" when I saw the incompetence, nepotism and graffiti on the wall. ""Run Forrest, Run!"""

Fascinating times in China. Turning the lights off in a mall. I m getting quotes for coal 171 to over $200. With that kind of jump in price no real move in the stock price. It looks like most of AMR exports are to Europe. Which is also feeling the pain. It’s still September what lies ahead?

"Q4 numbers aren't good but the guidance looks very positive. ~50% of production locked in at $85.47 per ton, a 10% increase over Q4 2020 and with spot prices higher than that. Very strong leverage to any met coal price increases and with steel at all time highs, I expect met coal to have a strong 2021."
$150/sh is the minimum fair value. Stock trading at 60% discount to fair value. Just do the FCF calculation for 2022. Period!
"The march to $100 continues, awesome move up today. Things continue to improve, coal prices just broke all time highs. Yet none of the met coal producers stocks show it...yet."
"Coal pricing has gone parabolic in the past month or so, looking at EPS around $80 for 2022 with current pricing. I doubt it will be that high but going to break $100 by Christmas should pricing stay near this level.

Launch in T minus 9 days and counting. Q2 will beat & the report about how much pricing has moved up for 2022 contracts will propel this baby to $30 maybe even above $40.

I think they should stop the growth projects ASAP and shore up the balance sheet. Cash burn is a problem. Investors are now penciling out the math on whether they can avoid bankruptcy. New mines almost always have problems when they start out. This isn't the time to layer on operational risk and spend their remaining cash.

mm partial drawdown of credit line is the only news today. nothing unusual given every company is doing that. Why the huge dump????
Stock consolidating after huge move up in past 6 months. Earnings report in August will be the next catalyst when they announce how much more new contract pricing is going for. Still has 2-3x of upside when announced. Cash costs to produce are $70-75 per ton & overhead+capex is another ~$25 per ton. They were at $85 per ton realized pricing last quarter. New contracts should be $130+. $30 margin per ton at 13+ million tons is almost $400 million in profit! Market cap is $440 million. Buy buy buy.

"Disastrous year for CTRA with terrible mitigation of costs during the MET coal down turn. I could have run this company better than the bozos who left before the coal hit the fan. If they can get costs under control, they might limit losses and even eke out a few pennies profit. They bought $32M in shares at $31.73 / share. Buybacks for this company are even more disastrous. I would rather see investors get a special dividend, or hold the money to help save this wounded bird."
"Broke $30 and stayed there today as I said before. Not the best quarterly report since the Aussie index killed them for Q2 but they are looking at a 70% increase in revenue with minimal cost increases coming up. They are getting $140 per ton vs $83 for Q2 now & are locking in contract at or above that value. Also, they are selling more into China with its CFR $320 per ton pricing. They expect 1 million tons this year & that might increase. This is going over $60 within 6 months."
"CTRA is finally past a horrendous 2019 that had the another company's bankruptcy cost them ~$100 million (blackjewel), a sharp drop in Met coal pricing, their CEO leave (good thing long term), and a questionable merger with Alpha that burdened them with thermal coal assets.
