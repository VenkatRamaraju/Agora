What 28 year-old company has a PE as high as CMG?

I heard about CMG the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
BUY SOME BROS ( DUTCH BROS)
"This stock price is a joke, just like their food"
Chipotle adding salt and pepper to their menu worth another 100 points
"Not too long ago it was trading over $1,940.02"
Dennis Geiger of UBS is the latest pumper to take his turn. He expects the smoked brisket to be well received and drive sales. LOL. It will probably be as well received as the cauliflower rice that quietly exited the stage as rapidly as it was introduced.
"Nobody eats here.. Not today, not tomorrow, not next week, not next month or even next year. MADNESS"
The Fed is pumping the market hard today....This will end badly. I wish they would let market forces control the prices somewhat.
"A read of Chipotle threads on LinkedIn /Reddit employees threads once again confirmed wage theft is widespread.Managers are incentivized to control costs in order to collect on bonus in addition to sales. Hourly workers are routinely shortchanged on their hours worked, after having signed off their time worked, managers would edit and reduce their hours worked, a blatant wage theft."
"Go back and review how many analysts Ackman paid to bolster his manipulated plays on Herbalife and Valeant, both on the long and short side. Better yet, read up on PSTH boards on twitter/Reddit about Ackman.CMG is still facing a workforce implosion, understaffing and stores closing due to labor shortage. Meanwhile, some 8 Mil CMG customers lost their Federal Pandemic benefits last week.CMG is a 30 yr old business, with a 6.4% profitability, single digit growth yr over yr and widespread sham accounting including wage theft, and a sweatshop operator compared to tech companies routinely booking 50% profitability and 50 - 100% growth year over year."
"This will be a $2T Market Cap company considered ""Tech"" within 2 years."
I wouldn't short this stock because I would have shorted it like 65% ago so it's a no touch for me :)
"The most toxic company to work for, both food and work culture.https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/pvx9wr/lol/"
"If you are watching CMG on L2, you are witnessing a master class in legalized corruption. You can see firms buying and selling shares to each other, and because the float is so small, the moves are huge. Total manipulation. Is it legal? No idea. But very shady."
A PE of 20 gives this ABOMINATION a price of 460 a share. What else is there to know??
"Is CMG stock market cap really worth 54 billion dollars?They have a total of 2800 restaurants.That make each physical location worth 19 million dollars?Wow, guess I'm missing something."
I don't like when you get the pork there is fat on it. Do some people like eating the fat?
nop better avoid you never know when institutional investor start dumping on retail. they are playing this very smartly. keeping stock elevated and keep selling to index funds as the market moves. this is how indexing will make price discovery and fair valuation impossible. It's a burrito chain with a very bad record of hygiene. one news and it's all over.
"Nicole Miller Regan, 6000 Chipotle stores in 40 years, but pay the price target now. No impact from labor strife, labor costs, ingredients and rice/beans burrito will be the national dish forever.Did she even finish high school?"
the customer experience has been going downhill for years. everyone sees it. what justifies this stock price?
NG prices are going to impact them badly. Watch for crash !!
cmg predictions for December. is 2050 a fair value ?
"How does a burritos stock fluctuate by over $165.00 in less than 15 trading days? Gringo's, Gringo's, Gringo's real value of this stock is no more than$340.00 at the very most, Booyah."
"This thing looks comatose. C'mon pumpers, do your thing!"
"Short 100 @ $1,919. A company selling middling, relatively expensive Mexican food with a PE of nearly 100 is ripe. Cover at $1300."
holding 10 of those 1920 puts for next weeks crash
"Took a look at the brisket at local CMG in Florida, its diced finely like the tofu...no thanks! I just ordered barbacoa. Even as good as the barbacoa is, the prices are too high vs local Mex food trucks."
SHORTS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED ON CMG SINCE THE $380s.BTW. THE GOOG/GOOGL LATE OCTOBER & NOVEMBER 19th CALLS AT A HUGE DISCOUNT. GET SOME WELL BEFORE OCTOBER EARNINGS IMO
Felt like a bit of panic selling today and esp at close. Chart looks like textbook bear flag.
"hmmm, I wonder if the company repurchase pump had to take a break for a quite period? Anybody know the status of the repo program? What trading desk they use?"
i'll cover my 1950 short at $1300
"2000 should be here shortly. Then a split and a run to 2500. This is all coming without a doubt. Only way to make any money in the current markets is to buy the biggest bubbles available. This environment might last for a few years or longer, who knows...just buy and make money!!! Cheers!!!"
"Remember CMG is going to $2,000.00"
Coinbase has made more net profit in this ytd (3.8bil) than Chipotle made in last decade yet have same market cap.
Cmg boardroom managementYou guys are so stubbornTwo ways you reinvigorate your locationsAdd shredded lettuce as an add on optionAdd bean sprouts as an add on optionThis would lift the bowls and the burritosTo both meat eaters as well as vegetarian male and femalesYour lettuce sucks and has gotten oldAlso your quesadillas are too smallA d t xAs obvious as pepsi buys out jsda for just to steal three flavorsCola strawberry lime and grapeThen small energy cans in a special cooler with a new regular pepsi energy drinkTake that cokeBuddah the fixerPart time fortune teller
Why isn’t this moving with cohens pump?? Is it done??
"Can someone tell Nicole Miller Regan to start pumping this thing again? C'mon, Nicole. Get on it. $2600!!!! To da moon!!!!"
"Love their dividend.... Oh wait, no divided. That's right, only legit companies pay dividends...LOL"
"LOL,,,CMG up 15 on 20K shares traded...LOL....Maybe Ill buy 100 shares and pop the stock 3 points....LOL"
"Chipolte claims that 24 million people signed up for their membership. If you believe that number and if you believe anyone would return to Chipolte after getting ripped off and leaving hungry, they you really need to buy stock in Proctor and Gamble. They are the makers of Pepto Bismol."
Who eats at this place I know I dnt
Imagen having a Gringo from Churchill Swartz & Associates buys you 100 shares of (CMG) @ $1940.00 a share for your Portfolio as a long-term investment?
All the experts are saying this is a long term super-duper investment.
"Funny how the SEC opens an investigation into Activision Blizzard workplace practices butdoes not touch Ackmans Chipotle. Chipotle has been violating labor laws all along? Name one companythat punches everyone out automatically at 11pm no matter how much work is left to finish. Itdoes not get any more blatant than that. Just another signof the useless, bias, bought and sold government officials.plus the food is AVERAGE. NO GREAT FOOD BREAKTHROUGH HERE. ONLY MARKETING HYPE.We are do for another round of off business plan sleight of hand and a zillion burrito donation in the coming weeks as earnings approach"
shorted 1950 again
Time to increase the price target to a very modest $3000. What pumper will be the first to make the call? Nicole? Kramer?
"Contagious covid positive workers were told to report for work bc of under staffing.Wanna catch covid19, Have a Chipotle.Go check Reddit threads on Chipotle."
Smoked brisket that’s another 5billion valuation. Next week it’s Chipotle flavored chips another 5billion valuation. What a crooked market manipulated by biggest crooks on Wall Street
Heard Cramer had a thing or two to say about CMG on his Lightening Round bit. Anyone catch that? What did ole JC have to say about it? Thanks in advance.
"Average cow slaughtered for meat weighs about half a ton or 1100 pounds, of which about 10 pounds are brisket. Remember how they were pumping Cauliflower rice for months and then withdrawn?"
"Chipotle agrees to $8M settlement in manager trainee classification suitgoogle the story.CMG is a sham company reporting bogus earnings for years, with countless systemic wage theft settlementsand several outstanding lawsuits pending. Every quarterly earnings, they take an adjustment to account for some settlement over wage theft in the footnotes/adjustments.NYC alone has an outstanding lawsuit amounting to hundreds of millions owed in wages."
Goldman on the call today trying to prepare the market for less than stellar CMG earnings. Can the pumpers keep this thing levitating?
Chipotle = Polo Loco 1987 .... Nothing more
Chipotle workers walkout in Queens after company refuses to pay during Hurricane Ida closureGoogle the breaking news story.
cmg to 1600 or 2200?
hows my 1950 short looking? scam back to 1300
"New CEO Niccol in 4 yrs on the job added 340 new stores, growing it from 2510 to 2850 stores today.So it will take 40 years to hit 6000 stores.International expansion? Sure, French, Italian, Spanish will give up their haute cuisine for rice/beans pigswill from CMG. Mexicans will embrace Fake Mex too over their original cuisine.Nicole Miller Regan conveniently pumped the numbers after Pershing Sq added more shares, It's not a coincidence. Go read up on how many analysts were paid to pump Ackman's holdings in Herbalife/Valeant in years prior."
Today's High was a little more than $100.00 from 52 week High.
"For all of you folks who get soaked when CMG tanks, I've drafted the basis for your shareholder suit against the company so that you might be able to recover some of your massive losses: “Plaintiffs seek treble damages against Defendants Niccol, Hartung, et al. for executing a corporate stock repurchase scheme pursuant to section 10b-18 and 10b-5 of the securities code of the USA, whereby Defendants, as fiduciaries to and for the Company, repurchased shares of the Company’s common stock in open market transactions at prices in excess of 400% of the FMV of comparable securities while, at the same time, executing sale transactions of their personal shares of the Company’s common stock obtained through the Company Executive Incentive Plan dated __________. Plaintiffs violated their fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the Company and enriched themselves ……………….……………………………………………………….……………………………………………………………………………….”"
"$2,000.00 or 4 for 1 split."
CMG should open stores in Mexico.
The one time I don't have short position in this T*^* Criminal stock and it's finally moving the right way.
Coinbase balance sheet one year public 5.4 billion/no debt. Chipotle 18 years public 920 mil/no debt. Same market valuation.
Instead of adding pricey brisketAdd shredded lettuce like mcdonalds usesCha chingSame store sales go upBuddahBean sprouts may have to be dollar or two dollar add onThe vegetarians will gladly pay it.Your menu is staleA quesadilla that should be twice as big is not the answerAs you wait to long for those to be ready and sau I should have just went through the lineBuddah
"DPZ misses on rev in the USA even with $250 - $300 month for every child under 18 and $400 month for 46 million student loan borrowers. CMG is no different - they will beat EPS and start missing on rev, if not this qtr, it will be q4."
"CMG to $2,000"
"stock will split somehow today, watch"
SEC should investigate CMG for manipulation. Not doing their job. Some stocks have become a circus.

"Don't be hoodwinked by the #$%$ Ackman again.Remember, in Jan. 2020, he filed to Sell all Pershing's stake in CMG but Never did, all designed totrap Puts option buyers.Meanwhile, Cramer is still pumping Cauliflower fart rice despite Chipotle quietly cancelling it months ago.In 4 yrs on the job, Ceo Niccol added 350 stores, and majority of stores are still severely understaffed and facing workforce attrition, he's no longer pumping 5000 stores/$10 Bil sales ?"
Wondering what all these negative people against chipotle doing here are they trying to convince us to sell .. because their shortttt must be
Crooked market run by crooked institutions pumping stocks everyday for their employers.Nicole Miller biggest pumper ever
Who pump it this morning?
DIdn't the Chipotelane announcement add a couple hundred dollars to the price awhile back...how is that going for them?
"The company is the only real buyer here. The other volume is almost entirely made up and is necessary in order for the company to stay within the 25% limit - just left pocket right pocket among the funds that ran the stock up in the latest MO play. The fraudsters who bought the stock last month on the way up are selling it to the company at a higher price. A good question from another poster, would you rather buy an ounce of gold or a share of CMG?"
Is Chipotle involved in the Salmonella breakout?
"The real value of (CMG) is no more than $340.00 at the very most and that is = to over 16 X last 4 quarters earnings, stay away from this stock or you might end up holding the bag like a bunch of other stocks that Churchill Swartz & Associates are accustom of doing,Booyah"
I went back into Chipotle last night after ordering online and I find employees wearing masks under their chins and using the same rubber gloves to make food and work the register. Wear a mask or don’t wear a mask but don’t wear it under your chin and constantly touch it while preparing someone’s food. So disgusting I left my $15 burrito. Small cost to avoid eating from a cesspool.
What's going on here? Time for Nicole Miller Regan to send out another pump report.
"Last Friday I heard an analyst on CNBC singing praises of CMG and said it has TREMENDOUS PRICING POWER?Did any of you catch this,what is her name?"
"This reminds me a bit of how Janus fund pushed up Sun microsystems back in 2000.. With CMG having a low float and thinly trading. Current funds, manipulators cant get out. Eventually Sun microsystems crashed back to earth. This wont correct until and market event, where folks want redemtions, panic sell, etc.. Anyway, how i see it. IMO it should be trading at 30 multiple to be generous."
lol did the big boys get out? no weird spikes all day.
"One useless headline per week fraud company, 2 of 2804 stores testing veggie Chorizo this week, Last week it was school supplies, Next month, it will be Bogo.Meanwhile, they quietly removed Cauliflower Fart Rice after 4 months of relentless promotion nationwide.LinkedIn/Reddit threads showed majority of hourly workers are Not making more despite hike in hourly wage, because of reduced hours, hourly workers are routinely sent home once peak hours are over.So corporate raising menu prices to pay wage hike was a SCAM designed to boost Sales, Not pay workers more since hourly workers are grossing Not more than before wage hike.Is there a more scandalous company out there ?"
Will close below 1800 this week. Market outlook for the rest of the month seems brutal.
"BROS soaring, and just getting started. Going to be another long-term winner like CMG and DPZ IMO"
Amazed this hasn’t corrected down to $1600 yet
"They wont let the price fall below 1900...LOL....once it did, the usual manipulators popped it back up... It's all right there folks on L2. It's not like they're trying to hide it either. Same cast of characters, different day..."
Do we get another PT upgrade anytime soon? Nicole congratulations you have highest price 2600 maybe next we have Joe Shlopp with 3000 . Then Nicole you will have to raise to 3500.
"Anyone really think Burrito will grow over 50% in 2022,23, and 24?"
Cowen pumper Andrew Charles blowing big burrito gas this morning.
Earning are going to miss...how much is the question. Inflation is going to eat up all the profits plus.
"8.4 Mil CMG customers lost their Federal Pandemic unemployment last week.LinkedIn's CMG threads all said past long weekend was slow .You betcha, uncle Sam stopped paying for overpriced rice/beans pigswill for 40% of CMG's customers."
CMG needs to do whatever it can to get more workers. Every chipotle near me is closed at least 1 day a week due to staffing shortages. I’m sure CMG are losing more in revenue than it costs to pay a little higher for workers can’t imagine how execs don’t understand this.
"$1,812.75-$1,822.75 Trading Range."
"OK, in full disclosure, I love Chipotle burritos. Yummy. But, a burrito is a burrito. A PE ratio of 92 implies huge forward growth. Is that growth really going to happen?"
What happened to the cauliflower rice? Didn't that add a couple of hundred dollars to the stock price?
"SHREDDED LETTUCE....just try it,,, butterscotch pie for dessert, you have no dessertSektorbeAN SPROUTS THAT COME IN A BAG FROM SAFEWAYADD THEM TO A BOWL OR A BURRITOYOU WILL SAY,""SEKTOR IS NOT JUST ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT STOCKSRATHER HAVE PIXEL 6 PRO THAN IPHONE OR ULTRA.a d t x,, 10 BAGGER IF YOU CAN READ AND STIT STILL MORE THAN 3 MINUTES, TAKES 5 TO READ WHAT IS THEIR AND THINK."
"Chipotle reminds me of Boston Beer(Sam), especially around April."
"Went to chipotle once, wasn't good. Don't understand why anyone eats there lol.Ate once, never went back."
"Loaded up today. CMG to $2,000.00Ignore the bashers!"
will cover at 1300
This is one of the worst places I've been to. My son was just there and waited over an hour for his order he placed online. Then he saw someone in the kitchen drop food and put it in the customers tray.
Seriously over valued.
"Just started tracking CMG. Cant see anything keeping it up except size and likelihood that institutional ownership has it locked in, clearly not a value trade. Question is what is trigger that brings it back to realistic P/E, The outflow of liquidity in the market?"
"When the market falls (even a little), all the ""manipulators"" come out and play behind the scenes...CMG, RH, DOCU....all popping as they do on market days like this."
The Real BlakeBurrito at Chipotle is Fantastic!!!!
What happens when the pumps no longer pump?
"I like to order from Chipotle. When I go there, business is brisk! I have been holding CMG for half a decade."
"This market should scare both longs and shorts. It's totally unhinged from reality with companies like CMG and other high-fliers leading the way. Until now, betting on red has been the way to go - has nothing to do with reality. The Feds balance sheet will be around 10T assuming they finish QE mid 22 - then what? What's the end-game? IMO, if the Fed continues beyond 10T, equities elevate even further. If not, the markets crater. $1 in equals $5 in market value and vice versa - trading at the edge."
but I like burritos.
Let’s get richer
buy at the top advocates help you loose money
Coinbase is making 14x the net profit of Chipotle with same market valuation.
shorted few more. it will not go over 2000 and that's only 4% up.
Nicole CMG is selling quick let’s get a new PT to 3000. It’s all fantasy anyway.
Up almost $600 per share since March 1st. Thats amazing.
"Can this stock ever grow into reasonable valuation? Say, in the 20-25 P/E level? If not, what can their institutional owners be holding for?"
"WHAT’S MISSING IN THIS AVERAGE STOCK PRICE TARGET OF $1936 IS THE RISK OF FOOD POISONING, EITHER AT THE POINT OF ORIGIN OR IN THE RESTAURANT FOOD PREPARATION! Didn’t CMG already have one a few years ago? Am I missing somethin? 17 analysts have an average stock price target of $1,936. This risk factor is not being considered. WHY I’M SHORT ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG WITH THIS EXTREMELY OVERVALUED STOCK. ITS P/E IS OVER 100!"
Interest rates going higher so noooooooboooody eating burritos any more? This is why people look at stock market as a casino..
"Check Reddit on the imploding CMG.Managers threatening employees down w. Covid to report for work or face termination.Online orders routinely late by an hour or more, and cold food at that.Inadequately trained workers running stores into the ground.Many, many catalysts for CMG to go belly up.Cauliflower rice?"
"LOL>>>Every day a new 52W high..... For no reason at all...LOL....Greed up on the top is live and well folks. To put this kind of valuation on uncertain numbers and future with regards to this virus and variant is a joke. The most absurdly valued stock amongst its peers, but hey, welcome to the markets of today. But man, I want to be short when this thing deflates. Question is not if, its when. But when will that be? Who knows!!!"
"A reading of Chipotle employees threads on LinkedIn and Reddit all overwhelmingly said despite higher wages, they're making about the same or slightly less net, meaning their hours are being reduced and working even harder.Make No mistake the wage hike was a Cover used by corporate to fatten Sales/earnings by raising menu prices. CMG has Never ever reported honest financials ever, with systemic wage theft spanning decades as recent class action lawsuits in NYC confirmed."
"Looks like they are trying to do their best to pin it at around 1900. Everytime it gets to that point it stalls and takes a uturn to going back up. Hopefully, the revocation of the unemployment benefits this week will take this ponzi scheme down."
Remember when the whole ecoli scare dropped this down to upper $400s from mid $700s? Now 400% higher than then. The experts all predicted…..sell. Amazing.
"The Most toxic workplace with the most abused employees amid mass exodus, that's the sweatshop operatorCMG for you.They wanna get to 6000 stores in 40 years, and unable to retain/hire staff for 2800 stores for the past year.New ticker symbol for CMG coming, $CAM"
(CMG) this stock is more fake than any implants I've ever seen in my whole 72 years and I saw a lot of implants lol.
"Prepare yourself for $2,000. Its coming whether you want it to or not...From a T/A standpoint, it looks ready to take it's next leg up after breaking out from it's bull flag and retesting the top...Stop whining about prices and focus more on making money...you'd be a lot happier..."
Shareholder lawsuit: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-morris-kandinov-investigating-080700533.htmlWhat's this about? CMG cooking the books?
Huge gains coming for cmg. Stock split in 2022
"Remember I said ""CMG IS GOING TO $2,000.00 a share."
Did Chipotle shrink their burritos. Spent over 50 bucks on 4 burritos looked like big tacos/grubhub. Great food but never again. Economic slowdown and this stock will drop fast.
Money trading hands but no one leaves the table? PE of 92!????!!!
"WOW. I am shocked that Chipolte garbage rated so high with teens. I find the slop, extremely expensive, bland and very poor servings. I ordered chips and dip and there was 11 chips in the bag. Total rip off. But I am an older consumer. I will never go back. I can get a full meal with a beer cheaper then a bowl of this slop. Even if teens do not know what is good food, it still does not justify the outrageous valuation for this slop server."
"Watching these guys buy and sell to each other as they inch it back up to 1920.... Unbelievable...Aint illegal, but if that's not stock manipulation, then not sure what is. Only thing that's truly going to delate this overinflated pig is a serious correction (which everyone seem s have been saying for the past 6 months yet never comes) or a food scare. Those behind the scenes as you can see on L2 wont ever let it fall,"
"Sellers, including senior management, are squeezing the company buy back plan. Management and the BOD should be hung in the lobby when this thing craters for using company funds to buy stock at these prices while personally selling their stock to the company. As long as there is a natural buyer of $50 million/month, the hedge funds are going to keep the price at absurd levels because they know the institutions that own the company (>90%) won't sell into it as the high price just marks up their paper positions and makes the funds look good."

"SHORTS DESTROYED ON CMG LOL. BTW, I believe BROS will be a $200-$300 stock."
"I predict that the market will not love earnings next week but that the stock will split, which will send the stock into orbit for no reason. Like the TSLA and APPL splits last year, the effect of the split will soon wear off."
"I don't see how this company can succeed when you talk to people working for them. It seems there are very tough working conditions, with little compensation."
Does anyone want to get a burrito and chips for lunch at CMG today?Hello!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Anyone??As I imagined....NO ONE eats here.............

BUY SOME BROS
upcoming Q will be digital disaster 100%
Chipotle reminds me of Polo Loco back in the 80's. Just another fad. Look where it is now.
"For the last few months, I in 5 customers in the restaurant has to asked to leave because they weren’t  masked. Even worse, the restaurant wouldn’t provide one to those without. A slap in the face to loyal customers, I felt. I hope this severely impacts sales in this upcoming quarter. How do turn away customers because of a mask? Every other restaurant on the block doesn’t have this policy. It’s my opinion that if the stated policy that customers must be masked when ordering at the counter, Chipotle must provide one. Meanwhile, a dozen people are eating just steps away without a mask. Is this crazy? No mom and pop restaurant would ask customers to leave because they weren’t masked. You know this! Martha’s Bakery (just next door) has masks if you don’t have one. So do many other restaurants. If fact, it may be legally required that restaurants provide a mask if it’s the policy of the restaurant. Do other Chipotles have this same policy? Must be masked to be served?"
"It's kind of sad that the only thing that will drop this turd is an overall 10-15 percent market correction (which is due, but who the heck knows- - folks been saying this for a year now). Good company, run well, but it's just a little too ahead of itself re: share price. No other company in sector comes close to being as ridiculously over inflated as this."
"The opposite of ""Food With Integrity"". https://finance.yahoo.com/m/509353ad-8dfd-3162-ada1-510f65ddfcc9/taco-bell-to-launch-the.html?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"

Looks like we have some nervous hands this morning.
Digital sales number will sky rocket … went to several stores over past two weeks and surprise… no in person order. You had to put order through app. This was in meridian ID and another one in Phoenix az… now that will definitely juice the digital numbers when stores only take orders through app.
Why in the world is Chipotle down huge today?
back short 1910 thanks piper!
"Nicole Regan in heat again and humping CMG anew. She's a one-trick pony. Her new price target based on a wishful 6,000 unit addressable market. Not actual market but what some wish the market would be. LOL"
"Let’s see — a valuation of approx 93 times earnings? For a fast food place that has just around 3000 in America (McD’s has around 18000 — 6 times as many, and has a valuation of approx 25 times earnings).Wasn’t there an incident where a Chipotle worker threw scissors at a customer?"
"After the bell: Piper says put new money into Chipotle, ups price target to $2,600Piper Sandler analyst Nicole Miller Regan raised the firm's price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill to $2,600 from $2,235 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst is making a ""valuation argument in favor of both continuing to own as well as put new money to work in CMG shares."" Chipotle is one of the highest return on invested capital companies in the industry and at a 6,000 unit total addressable market, the market is only assigning a 32-times price-to-earnings multiple based on today's stock price, Miller Regan tells investors in a research note. While new unit opening growth should be the dominant factor, menu changes and marketing ""also serve as catalysts,"" says the analyst. Miller Regan reiterates Chipotle as her ""top recovery investment recommendation."" Her 2025 estimates suggest ""at least"" $73 per share of earnings power."
Even the Pumping analysts have the price target Average @ 1814$100 less from where it's trading.
