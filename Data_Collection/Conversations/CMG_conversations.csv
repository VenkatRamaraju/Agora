Seems like institutions are selling out of CMG and buying into NFLX :P
"I will wait to buy some (CMG) when shares are down to about $280/$290 that's the real value for the long-term investment, Bam."
Taco is a much better value . I don't get this stock price. It would be expensive at 1200. That's where this stock should drop to on these earnings
They purchased $100 million worth of stock in the 3rd quarter at a price of over $1800/share. LOL. The charade continues - purchasing back shares of officers at inflated prices.
burrito stand trades at 10x sales lol
"All things considered, the sell off seems pretty orderly - almost coordinated. This is with a backdrop of record market highs day after day. A few things to consider when evaluating the strength and future direction of the market and corporate earnings - in fiscal 2020 and 2021 (oct -sept) the govt deficit (i.e., free money) represented approximately 15% of GDP for each of those fiscal years. That's just the deficit, not the entire budget of the federal govt. How much of that free money ended up in corporate earnings over the past two years? Well, without another 3-5 trillion dollars of free money in 2022, real GDP (accounting for inflation) is going to shrink by 10% to 15% barring any improvements in the real economy to offset the impact. I don't see it. Some economist have already called the start of the recession (8/21). In addition, the Fed has boxed themselves into a bad situation where they will have no choice but to remove stimulus or risk losing credibility in the dollar. They have already announced what they're going to do. Back to CMG, this sell off will accelerate as large holders begin to reposition their portfolios accordingly. IMO"
"P/E ratio now at 71, when shd be Brinker ratio of about 17 (now 16). So stick price really needs to be cut in half two times to get to a fair value IMO. And to give it some for growth can add a bit. CMG shouldn't be more than $700/share. That's one expensive burrito!"
Please announce another Drag Queen celebration week. That should be worth at least $100/share!
"Prediction, CMG beats earnings after making adjustments for this, that and other things. Refuses to issue negative guidance for Q4 or next year despite significant headwinds in hopes of another round/extension of stimulus for their target customer from Congress before year-end."
"OMG —- such petty net income per share. >>Net income for the third quarter was $204.4 million, or $7.18 per diluted share, an increase from $80.2 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of a tax benefit, PSU modification expenses, corporate restructuring expenses, and restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, adjusted net income was $199.8 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $7.02.<< $204 million. AND NO MENTION OF POSSIBLE FOOD POISONING/CONTAMINATION! After all, isn’t that a big risk? It could be in any one of the variety of foods that get delivered or on the food preparation inside their dirty kitchens and counters. DIDN’T THIS HAPPEN ALREADY — MORE THAN ONCE. Another reason to be short!"
"The growth story, the digital transformation, the technology company, etc. are all over. They were just hype to begin with. The anemic growth points to a massive p/e contraction. With the thin float outside of institutions, it won't take much for this to drop like a rock. This is about to be Boston Market 2.0."
"How can a $1.00 Stock be $1,800???"
Starbuck just raised wages .and keep $200 referral bonus
"Am I reading this correctly EPS Q2 $7.46, Q3 $7.02, and Q4 est $5.34????? And CMG still has a PE of 70x? That's with 50 additional stores each quarter! Something is not right."
lmao they have the CEO on CNBC to get retail to buy. STRONG SELL as inflation eats away at margins. He claims he can raise prices....gflwt.
NOBODY is eating at Chipotle these days at least all of the locations in my city! This stock is DUMPING fast. Get out quick!!!
"Bought chips guacamole, 2 burritos and vegan bowl on Grubhub. 55 bucks with 8 dollar tip. Never again."
Are Chipotle's onions from Mexico? Stock went from $15B market cap when Niccols took over to over $50B. Avoid..
If Chipotle burritos sold at the same price as CMG stock they would sell for $50 a burrito!
lmao those earnings aren't even close to justifying valuation. when taper starts this will dive.
