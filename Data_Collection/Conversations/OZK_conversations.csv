"Kind of surprising the so called “Analyst” that follow this bank have not caught on to how volatile this institution has become. Expenses are running hotter than expected, turnover is high in the community banking segment, payoffs appear to outstrip[ping loan originations, NIM is shrinking much faster than expected and the company appears to be a “one trick pony” from a potential growth perspective. Investing in a company that has a huge presence in the RV and boat market while simultaneously writing large complex loans most bank shy away from is a recipe for disaster. Not to mention the fact they lost the architect of the RESG group over two years ago which appears to be just now showing up. Stockholders have been butchered in this name and it certainly doesn’t look like the market is buying managements explanations as stated in the conference call transcript. This bank is one event away from being a mid-teen stock."

"Can someone explain this shareholder lawyer firm. Are they suing the executives? If found guilty, do the executives lose their salaries or something? It does not come out of my pocket I hope?"
any reason why this continues to tank? more bad news looming in their loan portfolio? it's pretty much trading at Great Recession level prices at this point.
$28.40 in AH.Guess the market wasn't too happy with the quarterly
Slowly creeping up to $29 or higher...
Citigroup just put it at a buy less then a month ago when it was $50
Let's hope OZK dips more before resuming course to 50+. I love discounts.
ALL banks are knocked down right now. No one knows how many loan customers have stopped making loan payments in the second quarter. The second quarter earning later this month will be telling for all banks. OZK carries very few home loans. The RESG commercial loan portfolio has always been conservatively underwritten...we will see how it looks at the earnings release. It’s always worthwhile to listen to the earning call...Gleason is strong.
A $700 Million CMBS Portfolio Is On the Brink as Malls CollapseInteresting article on Yahoo. OZK may be slightly higher on the food chain but the pain is coming.
Any thoughts on the 350 million public offering? Are they building up more capital to make an acquisition? Isn't this bad for current shareholders due to dilution?
Fundamentals are top notch. Still undervalued headed to 50
After hours trading should be stopped. If we all can’t play on the same field it’s wrong. Retail investors hands are tied and they are down $6 and can’t move. What a joke.
OZRK is going to spend money to get rid of its name. I voted “NO” on my proxy.
Took a position just under $43 today. I have been waiting for a dip. Anyone else buy this morning?
This is the best bank in the US without a doubt! Excellent ran organization with the best credit quality of any bank!!
Sell off today way over done! Economy strong rates moderated and banks will make a lot of money! End of 2019 this will be $40 plus! Sell off today irrational.
Well done? Burning cash to underwrite risky deals in an effort to prop up short term revenue to appease quarterly earnings analysts? Bank OZK still refuses to appraise loans that would hurt short term earnings.How many more quarters can Bank OZK maintain this facade before the castle crumbles?
