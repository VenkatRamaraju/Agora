"Two two worst performing sectors over the last 1 year (perhaps even longer) have been energy and financials.What were the two (2) most recent purchases by Mr. Warren Buffet?Bank of America (BAC) and he bought Dominion Natural Gas operations from Dominion.What two (2) sectors will at least recover and negate their under performance?Hint, hint, hint: Watch Buffet.Moreover, I check Value Line and Morningstar and then bounce what gets flagged against GuruFocus, MarketGrader (available through Vanguard), Financial Visualization (FinViz) and others.Definitely the financials are undervalued and so is energy.The financials might recover because the homebuilders index is reaching new highs as mortgage interest rates are hitting new lows. Also, what would help would be federal interest rate hikes (although when is that ever going to happen in our lifetimes) that would expand the interest rate spread that constitute the profit margin at many financial institutions. In the absence of a Fed rate hike, the financials will have to look elsewhere to make money. Everything I see places a $30 stock price on OZK---actually closer to $45 to $65 (3 to 5 year price projection).I own shares and would / will by a modest amount more on expected current / continued weakness in the stock price---although I never bet the ranch on any one stock.Patience is a virtue and a necessity for investing (being right sometimes also helps)."
With any luck these guys will be acquired by BB&T or another stronger super-regional.
Chart warned you all months ago
"15 different law firms going after OZK, too bad:))"
Mutt!
Sell off today way over done! Economy strong rates moderated and banks will make a lot of money! End of 2019 this will be $40 plus! Sell off today irrational.
"See my post from 14 days ago....Focus on the balance sheet, company press releases (dividend increases), and avoid Fake News from analyst who's shorting the stock! More good picks: cbl, mo, jblu, fcau. ing, x, cld,bac, c, ms!"
Should have listened to me last month about their loans and the price dropping. And I should have sold earlier myself. This is kind of like the country boy getting schooled in the big city.

on what basis do you say the construction loans are for overpriced high-rises in nyc and miami? what metrics do you use to conclude they are overpriced.
"So OZK has a great quarter, suggesting it is out of the woods of any financial stress, and the stock barely moves? If this were any other compny the stock would be UP 5 percent. What will it take?"
Great takeover prospects!!Yipee!!$40+ a share.
#OZK Turning up off its double bottom. Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator at foxchart. Long over 41.73 for a run up to 48.74.

What the eff is going on here?
The worst bank ever!!! Will prove it down the road!!
Well done? Burning cash to underwrite risky deals in an effort to prop up short term revenue to appease quarterly earnings analysts? Bank OZK still refuses to appraise loans that would hurt short term earnings.How many more quarters can Bank OZK maintain this facade before the castle crumbles?

They’ll beat earnings today
What's wrong y'all?
Bank OZK is down 33.92% to 14.20
People expecting OZK to miss or fail to adequately beat earnings and for the stock price to fall?
"Everythging I see indicates absolutely ZERO insider trading for an extended period of time.Stock goes DOWN, they don't buy.Stock goes UP, they don't sell.Last time I had a stock (Keithley Instruments) where the insiders did nothing regrdless of stock movement, they were actually shopping the company around.I would think someone would be interested in acquiring the company especially if the board was making it for sale.Anyone have any thoughts?"
A $700 Million CMBS Portfolio Is On the Brink as Malls CollapseInteresting article on Yahoo. OZK may be slightly higher on the food chain but the pain is coming.

Lawyer bully’s
Bank OZK is up 9.73% to 18.95
The answer--- YES.... This can't be a bad thing. I will take any little help in this sector right now.
Outstanding quarter as it appears that the market way over-punished this stock for two bad loans.
After hours trading should be stopped. If we all can’t play on the same field it’s wrong. Retail investors hands are tied and they are down $6 and can’t move. What a joke.
"Bank of Ozarks, OZK has a price to book of 1. Can we honestly discuss this, without the bias of Gleason loyals and haters?"
"Downgraded to Underweight today at Barclay's, target $38."
Congrats to everyone who stayed rational and actually done their research. Well done George a man to be admired!
OZK is up 8.21% to 17.39
Remember when I posted low 30s target. Looks like it is coming
The lawsuit and price say it all.

"Loans classified as ""construction/land development loans"" grew from $1.5 billion at the end of 2014 to $5.3 billion at the end of 2016, according to its most recent annual report."
ALL banks are knocked down right now. No one knows how many loan customers have stopped making loan payments in the second quarter. The second quarter earning later this month will be telling for all banks. OZK carries very few home loans. The RESG commercial loan portfolio has always been conservatively underwritten...we will see how it looks at the earnings release. It’s always worthwhile to listen to the earning call...Gleason is strong.
Can the big rivals be acquiring this baby...

I hate to say it - but this thing trades like something bad has happened and we just don't know what it is yet.
Wow.
OZK is down 26.94% to $25.46
Wonder if they will increase the dividend a quarter of a cent for the next quarter??? GLTA
"The loan loses are settled, and OZK is a bargain at this price!"
This is dead money right now
Muddy Waters Research was short this stock a while back and they have a track record of getting it right.
Commercial loan portfolio must be doing poorlyThis just keeps dropping
"they will crush earnings. I guarantee this company goes out of business in the next recession, but until the market turns great stock"
"I am now afraid of this stock. It is acting like someone knows that the earnings are going to disappoint Sinking more than others. Just saying, be careful."
"OMG, yet another one I missed. I ALMOST bought this yesterday. 14% up today, haha."
I think I correctly called this over 8 mos ago.
any reason why this continues to tank? more bad news looming in their loan portfolio? it's pretty much trading at Great Recession level prices at this point.
Slowly creeping up to $29 or higher...
Still think they can hit their 1Y target price of $60 either through acquisitions or being bought.
"Out at $40.19, good luck to everyone. Still could go higher, but I will take mine and move on."
Bank OZK reached a 52 Week low at 22.00
The worst bank ever
Earnings In AM
I think OZRK might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. have you guys heard of awesomeS-TOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
I would really wonder if this bank will pass the “plunge test?” They already failed on the market plunge!!
Oversold
I don't know who runs the stock price on OZRK . Its just one trading firm. Just have to hold on and let them do their thing. Of course they want it lower since they went short for earnings.
"Kind of surprising the so called “Analyst” that follow this bank have not caught on to how volatile this institution has become. Expenses are running hotter than expected, turnover is high in the community banking segment, payoffs appear to outstrip[ping loan originations, NIM is shrinking much faster than expected and the company appears to be a “one trick pony” from a potential growth perspective. Investing in a company that has a huge presence in the RV and boat market while simultaneously writing large complex loans most bank shy away from is a recipe for disaster. Not to mention the fact they lost the architect of the RESG group over two years ago which appears to be just now showing up. Stockholders have been butchered in this name and it certainly doesn’t look like the market is buying managements explanations as stated in the conference call transcript. This bank is one event away from being a mid-teen stock."
"July 27, 2017George GleasonChairman of the Board/CEOBank of the OzarksPlease accept this letter as my formal notice of resignation as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,President - RESG and CLO of the Bank.I have enjoyed being a part of a commercial lending team that has closed over $25B in financings sinceits inception. While the volume is nice, I am more proud of the fact that the portfolio has been builtutilizing incredible discipline (including the utilization of very low leverage with best in classsponsorship). In addition, the team is very talented and experienced.Thanks again,/s/ Dan Thomas"
"Shorts have a long way to go...amount of shares went up 10% in the last month. When they realize the trade went bad, we'll see new highs. If I'm right,we'll see 50's by the end of the year."
Buyout coming soon for this undervalued gem?
Bank of the Ozarks expects one-time expenses of between $15 million and $25 million due to its planned named change.
Typical for so many stocks. One never knows why a certain stock tanks or does poorly. It certainly isn’t usually by any readily available info. The insiders of course know and dump it before any of us little guys get screwed yet again by Wallstreet.
OZK is down 6.82% to $25.00
Bank OZK reached a 52 Week high at 36.61
why are their two listings for ozrk and also oak
I think OZK can make it to $40 to $5 this year.
"""We're not changing our business model at all,"" Mr. Gleason told analysts.Mr. Gleason said he expects the number of losses on the portfolio in the past 15 years to be ""similar"" for the next 15 years despite the fact that it has grown in size""I hear banjo music in the back ground....Deliver-us! LOL"
"With consistent rising revenue and profit, OZRK will likely be target of acquisition by larger rivals."
Down the toilet.

This has turned into garbage again.Better have some dynamite earnings and forward guidance or it will retest the low's
Buying opportunity here!!! Get on board!
"Regarding the name change:Summary of Charlie Munger's Daily Journal 2018 MeetingOn the banking industry: ""Well, banking is a very peculiar business. The temptations that come to a banking CEO are way…the temptations to do something stupid are way greater in banking than they are in most businesses. Therefore it’s a dangerous place to invest because there are a lot of ways in banking to make the near term future look good by taking risks you really shouldn’t take for the sake of the long-term future. And so banking is a dangerous place to invest and there are a few exceptions. And Berkshire has tried to (pick) the exceptions as best it could."""
Little guy always last to find out about bad news.SCAM
Out here with the nice uptick after nice results but 20% in 3 months is good enough for me.
Predictions for today?
"Bought 2000 shares Friday. Best regional bank in America. Back to highs in a year, plus big dividend."
"OMG, they're still lending in Miami/South Florida. Doesn't OZK pay attention to the short sellers and their dire predictions?""The developer of the YotelPad condo and hotel in Miami secured a $76.25 million construction loan to provide funds needed for completion.Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK (Nasdaq: OZK) provided the mortgage to NE 2nd Acquisition LLC, a joint venture between Aria Development Group and AQARAT, a Kuwaiti real estate company. It covers the project at 227 N.E. Second St.The developers broke ground on YotelPad in January, when it was over 50 percent pre-sold. It could be completed by early 2021.In a new statement, the developer said YotelPad is 75 percent pre-sold. More than 46 percent of the buyers are from Mexico and China, and many others come from South America.The 31-story tower will have 231 condos and 222 hotel rooms. The condos will range from 417-square-foot studios to 708-square-foot units with two bedrooms. They are priced $300,000-$500,000. The units are fairly small compared to many condos in downtown Miami. YotelPad condo owners will be allowed to engage in short-term rentals or to lease their units to the hotel operator, which could make them attractive to investors.Amenities at YotelPad will include a gourmet matcha bar, a restaurant and bar, a fitness center, a co-working space, a lounge, a pool and a pet salon. Each condo will also come with a storage unit."""
Bank OZK is down 6.90% to 19.56
"It is difficult to understand how anyone would be worried about OZRK loan quality. From the 2Q conference call:In our almost 20 years as a public company, our net charge-off ratio has averaged about 35% of the industry’s net charge-off ratio, and we have beaten the industry’s net charge-off ratio in every year. Our outperformance has been even better recently, as evidenced by the fact that our net charge-off ratio was just 13% of the industry’s net charge-off ratio last year and just 10% of the industry’s net charge-off ratio for the first quarter of this year."
This is potentially the value of a lifetime if the loan mess is overblown which it likely it. Dividend up again. 4 plus percent raise on an over 3 percent dividend. Quarter after quarter.
40% increase in EPS and Revenue from last 3rd Quarter
OZK reached a 52 Week low at 22.00
Results after the close today. I'm seeing EPS expectations of $0.90-0.91 on revenues of $258.0 million.
"This bank terrifies me. I would love to hear everyone's opinions as to why they think this is a $30 stock. I could see this bank going belly up soon. Target price $0-$15.They have grown exponentially through acquisition over the past decade to support their risky construction loans.Do they even know the details or status of their $1B remaining in purchased loans?Why has Bank OZK only reserved 1.6% for credit losses? JP Morgan and other banks that routinely underwrite much less risky deals are reserving 2%. That is at least $80M additional expense that Bank Ozk should have taken in Q2 2020. So much for beating estimates...How many times is Bank OZK going to blame the CECL accounting practices for estimating credit losses? Good banks evaluate risk/potential loss during the underwriting process.Why has Bank OZK avoided appraisals on their risky construction loans? Their loan to value ratios would be crushed.How many off-balance-sheet commitments has Bank OZK made in the last several? Do their financial statements have any validity?It is clever how they “Modernized” Arkansas banking regulations by shedding their holding company allowing them to stop reporting to the SEC amidst scrutiny of their practices. Unlike every other bank regulated by SEC, they only report to FDIC.Why are insiders scrambling to sell their shares in the $25-30 range in the last few months?Bank OZK is either cooking the books or is so clueless that their bank is about to collapse that they increased their dividend."
Let's hope OZK dips more before resuming course to 50+. I love discounts.
This is a $50 stock that was trashed over a 2 loans in which they did everything possible to recover made 10 years ago. Well covered by loan loss provisions. Been a hell of a ride.
"Back in at $38.99. Too tempting at this level. Bank profits doing well, hopefully climb back from here."
Took a position just under $43 today. I have been waiting for a dip. Anyone else buy this morning?
"Can someone explain this shareholder lawyer firm. Are they suing the executives? If found guilty, do the executives lose their salaries or something? It does not come out of my pocket I hope?"

Yeppie yah yey...26% price drop!
took some @25.80
$35 calls October 18
Like I said 10 days agoHere come the $30sPredicting $30-32
Any thoughts on the 350 million public offering? Are they building up more capital to make an acquisition? Isn't this bad for current shareholders due to dilution?
Anyone concerned over earnings being announced a week later than usual?
$30+ coming soon.Beating down way overdone.
15% drop in four monthsIs George cashing out?What is going on?
High implied volatility and they will probably get bought out. They are the worst bank I have ever seen. t
Why there is no activity on this stock

What a mutt this has turned into.
"No reason this stock should be down!!! Hold it will come back if not today, tomorrow and Monday. I’m doubling my position at the opening bell"
ticker symbol changed to OZK
"I listened to the analysts' questions and concerns on core spreads; competitive pressures in the CRE space and their relation to asset quality standards which must remain high and the first focus; and growth could be meaningfully lower than last year, though still better than peer average type metrics. The CEO says that the flow of quality deals is diminishing as rates rise. You'll be able to sleep at night with Bank OZK but this sounds like dead money."
Will sell off large tomorrow
"Just telling the truth, any hindrance should make the stopper look bad."
For B of O is what I should have said.
OZK is up 9.05% to 19.88
Sub-10 by Christmas.
Bank OZK reached a 52 Week low at 14.20
42.44 after market Monday should be interesting.
"Eventually Gleason will prove the haters wrong. OZK survived and thrived during the 2008 recession (they were heavily concentrated in CRE then too). They have a huge warchest of cash built up and will buy up struggling banks, just like in 2008. long term hold, back to $40 a share in 1-2 years."
Stock up today but only because it got pelted so bad over this whole month and value investors anticipating the weakness to cause a buyout on the cheap.
Dividend increase announced after the close today--the 35th quarter in a row for an increase. Up a lucky penny to $0.23. Never pass a lucky penny by.
OZK reached a new All Time Low at 40.58
Thoughts on how much this recovers Monday if there is no news?
Tanking last week after getting upgraded.Hilarious.Must be the crooks on Wall Street needing to DUMP shares
Bank OZK is up 6.54% to 43.01
"Another dividend increase, yet the stock price continues to get punished. This should be a $30 stock minimum."

"Slight beat on 1Q EPS. Net revenues were a slight miss. Bank OZK (NASDAQ:OZK) reported quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.84 by 2.38 percent. This is a 2.27 percent decrease over earnings of $0.88 per share from the same period last year.The bank posted revenue of $319.3 million in the period. Its revenue net of interest expense was $250 million, which did not meet Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $251.9 million."
$30 soon??? It seems like the worst is behind OZK now
Buffett is still holding. That tells me its still a buy
Another quarterly dividend increase! Back to $40+ soon.
Congratulations OZK on an outstanding Q1!!!
Stock goes up in after hours. Their tax adjustment accounts for 42% of quarterly earnings and the stock moves higher.

Doubled my position and now at 4000 shares cost average 44. I think it’s a great long term play for several reasons
Back on the roller coaster today. Put a sell order in for 40.19. Hopefully fills in the next week or so. This stock is just too unpredictable.
