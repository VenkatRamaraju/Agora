"I just received my ARCP settlement checks today vis USPS. I held the stock in 5 accounts and received 5 separate checks. Letter states this is my ""initial distribution of the Net Settlement Fund"". No insight provided into what that means. Checks are for 62% to 66% of what I guesstimated I would receive. I am guessing this ""initial distribution"" is for 2/3 of my expected final settlement."
"VER price is terrible. Market is really sick on this REIT. Management seems invisible. A sale would not properly value the income stream. The law suit is an overhang but management has been parking massive amounts of quarterly income which will hopefully be unleashed soon for growth. Down 41% on my capital investment. IMHO VER is massively oversold with a yield of 7.76%.With the proceeds of quarterly retention, the sale of Cole, and insurance proceeds (unknown amount) the risks are a pretty low that the insurance settlement is going to disrupt forward operations"
"According to my calculations, the first distribution was $1.32 and the second $1.73. Total of $3.05 per share. I would think there could be another closeout distribution to clean up uncashed checks etc. Maybe a nice lunch or beer money, not much more."
It's curious that the market is not celebrating these finance activities which will lower the cost of capital

Just not sure how everybody is so optimistic when they have 6.0 bil of liabilities on the balance sheet. Help me understand
Try buying a single tenant nnn. You’d be lucky to get 7%. And you would to manage it. This is crazy I’m missing something. They can refi there 5.5b in debt at lower rates now as well
whoot whoot Realty Income scooping up VER in a $50B deal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Selling to reduce my position after holding for many years. With settlement and dividends over many yearsI have positive returns (even if small). I'm not confident that post merger that the office stub won't lower the overall value I think O is a great company but it's really significantly overvalued once the Fed starts tapering in 2022. O has a great management team but buying in a these high prices is very risky
looks like 7.00 on tap

"This is why lawyers are so hated. I sent an inquiry to the law firm about the settlement. This is what I got back. My guess: they have 2 Jr clerks processing the claims; This is one of the most outrageous answers I've ever seen. I guess this poor law firm is doing this by hand instead of using these new marvelous inventions called computers. The longer it takes my put is the more money they will charge. Hopefully, most of us will still be alive to collect. ""We are currently processing claims for this matter. Processing time on our cases can take an average of 9 to 12 months from the January 23, 2020 submission deadline. Once processing is complete, we must then wait for authorization from Lead Counsel and/or the Court before we can distribute the funds which can take several additional months. Please understand that this is an estimated timeframe for processing based on our experience which does not guarantee that all case processing will be completed within twelve months. Processing time varies from case to case and some cases may take more or less based on the specifics of that case settlement. """
Does anyone think there will be another settlement check?
We withstood the public offering. 60 Million shares traded today. With the success of the offering and now our upgrade from Capital One I think we should see a rebound toward our 11.09 range!

Jean - - What is your source that the original date for the class action lawsuit resolution was September 2019 but has now been postponed to 2020? I see no information on VER's company website about that subject. Thanks.
"Today's announcement of the upsized secondary shows very strong demand from the market for VER. This tell is asubstantial piece of good news that management is being supported in its strategy to return to growth in 2020. VERis a deep value stock that will come out of the doldrums soon. Smart money is buying. I plan to follow their lead andadd to my existing 5,000 share holdings. It's about time we get back on the track of rewards. CEO Rufano is the real dealof executive leadership. You should remember that for the last few years VER has only paid out $0.55 of the $0.72 in earnings."
Verrit should sue its former chairman to recover some of the money they are paying out to Vanguard and others.

Did any of you receive the latest letter regarding the ARCP class-action lawsuit? I already received the two payouts. Are we going to receive another one? Thanks.
"Now I own VER with an average of $3.68. Can it go lower, maybe. But I am ready to average down from those price if people panic and sell again. I think I will be very glad for grabbing those shares when the dust settles! GLTA VER Investors."
Looks like people finally read the report. Probably someone going to recommend it and their followers are in on it early.
I didn't think we would see this below $9 again.InterestingLooks attractive to meI expect a dividend increase late in 2020.aa

stock has been doing better than O percentage wise over past month and 3 months. So I think it has a good chance to have the market treat it for what it is worth and not past mistakes.
Talked to settlement admin today and checks are expected to go out 1st quarter of 2021.
"Rent collections so far for May are 78%, which is about 1% ahead of where we were during the same time period in April. Due to the uncertain market we all face, the Board of Directors is reducing the second quarter dividend from $0.1375 to $0.077, representing a decrease of 44%. So dividend yield is still around 6%. Which is decent and should help VER weathered the storm. GLTA VER Investors"
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting the results to change. With the arrival of computer program trading the unfairness of the market has reached extremes since computers can continueto sell infinitely. Small investors don't have a chance with computers selling. While the impacts on the economy are certainly hurtful these prices signal the end of the world. Why have a market when it's rigged?I am not selling any of my stocks but even stocks like VER which have long term contracts are well insulated against short term disruptions. I've owned VER since 2012 and earned great dividends (except for the audit scandal). I have confidence in the management team.
Please stop climbing!!!!! Dripping my dividends!!!!
I think the recent quarter is right on track. I'm looking forward to a great 2020. The suit settlement puts this overhang on the stock behind us. Management indicated its focus on resumption of net acquisitions and improved results will lead to a high stock price.Management is executing brilliantly.
"The market is assessing the current performance of the management and Board and the stock price says it all: pitiful performance. If we don't see improvements soon, there will need to be a massive shake up at the top. The strategy is not working to improve shareholder value. The stock price is the ONLY metric that counts. The rest is irrelevant"
I own over 10K shares of this company.. ANYONE who thinks that the current mangement is not doing enough for shareholders is an uninformed moron. In the last 2 years alone the new management that came in to clean the stinking pile of garbage left by the previous management team.. has performed OUTSTANDING in every way and by every metric. Just the fact that they got there credit rating back to investment grade 6 to 8 months ahead of schedule and smartly tapped the equity markets to pay down debt and extend some other out 5 to 10 years was excellent. there is only ONE reason why this company is not trading over 11 we are waiting on the lawsuit settlement from Vanguard that was filed during the last management's reign. The company is pretty much done with divestitures and will start growing Q3-Q4 and they are EPS positive right now.... it only goes up from here with interest rates rising..creating an outstanding 6-8 month window to get as many shares as possible for the eventual run up to 12.50.... and collect 6.4% along the way
MAJOR down volume for the last several sessions. I hate to say I told you so but here we are down big.But nothing has really changed. Things are better than last year and better than the year before that. Weshould see the final lawsuit wrap up soon. Management has already tip its hat towards growth in the future. If you are a moderate risk taker VER is a vehicle to building wealth in the near future. Hang onand don't succumb to the Wall St. traders
VER let's get the other suits settled and move on...we've all been patient..

REITS are an absolute disaster at this point in time.
The Street has 12.05 price target on VER with a BUY rating today.
We seem to be the blunt end of the shorts today. Stock is not showing any strength which iscurious since the main heartaches of the past have been cleared. We should be positioned fora strong 2021 but no market interest?
"New one year high today on big volume. Lower interest help but VER is still undervalued compared to its peers NNN, O, WPC and others."
Nice little healthy correction before the next move up!
Not HAPPY w secondary...8% dilution...divvy raise better be coming...
"Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on VER? check out https://awesomepickstoday1.blogspot.com/, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."

Q&A with Glenn Rufanohttp://www.nreionline.com/reits/glenn-rufrano-talks-about-why-vereit-cutting-back-office-and-buying-retail-assets

Has anyone seen anything about a residual payment from the settlement fund?
"Dang Dawgs. VER. PF yielding 7% paying monthly. VER is solid have held for 4 years, always pay their preferred. IMOP best preferred stock, paying monthly, to own. Trom out."
Man. The sky is not falling. I am starting a position today for the 10+% yield. Have exit my position about 6 months ago and thought I may never have a chance to add under $9 again. A bargain for the long-term! GLTA VER Investor
Tenants ability to pay? Has to be causing some of the stress in this name. I own some - and want to add more - but worried about the economic impact to this virus.
VER is up 10.50% to 4.42
VER-PF is up 5.84% to 19.11
"lets close above 5.00 today,great buying time."
Why would VER do a thing like a reverse split so unnecessarily !!!!!Please shar if you see a valid reason behind the move.Thank you.
Great report today and 20% increase to dividend. I bought this on the way down at the start of pandemic for the 7% yield before div cut. With the latest increase I am above 4% yield on my basis. Much less painful now and can comfortably hold for a good long while. Current price yields 4.8% ish dividend yield. Future looking much better here and decent inflation hedge from my perspective.
"VEREIT IS ACTING VERY WELL,IMO I SEE $10.00 SOON,STAY LONG AND STRONG."

ARCP Litigation Statushttps://www.law360.com/articles/1236288
I think VER will be one of the biggest winners in 2019 in REIT equities.The undervaluation is significant due to market worries about the law suitsettlement. The pattern of settlements continues to be favorable. And thecompany will likely sue those who were responsible in the future.
Dovish Fed...good for us
"Bob's post is nowhere close to accurate about the company in the current state. Yes there was an accounting scandal and the CEO and CFO and Board and Auditors have all been fired. New management, New Board, New Auditors and a New Business Plan was introduced almost 2 years ago and it has been executed. It included paying down debt, reducing risk in the mix of properties, regaining investment grade rating, and starting up the dividend. All of the goals have been achieved. The company did change its name because it has transformed itself into a very respectable company."
does anyone have the online web address for the settlement claim form for shareholders to fill out who lost money?
Into new territory.....she just has to find a bottom. Pretty amazing.
Shareholders are being screwed by shorts. Management too passive needs to counter this terrible stock price.Very disappointing. Horrible beyond words. Very dark days. Hard to believe that the lawsuit has this kind of impact
Hell Yes! Can't declare victory yet with these crazy market. But my shares (average at $3.68) is looking awefully good (especially with the annual dividend yield)! GLTA VER Investors!
"Regarding the settlement, are you comfortable providing last 4 digits of your social security number? Are you mailing it or doing it online? Other than providing a page that shows the purchase of security on stmt, are you providing anything else?"
Hopefully we will see a modest dividend increase in 2020 as growth resumes
We are going to have a lot of bumps on the road to higher prices. A lot of damage has been done over the past several years andit's reasonable for sellers to emerge along the way as frustrated investors bail out of their pain. But this iswhat makes VER such a great value as each dip provides new entry points to average down costs of shares.
"New high today on big volume. My guess is VER will announce soon that it has agreed to additional law suit settlements.Also, the following buy recommendation helps:....""VEREIT Raised to Buy From Underperform by Bank of America. Dow Jones 6/11/19 7:04 AM ET."
"PHOENIX, June 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VEREIT, Inc. (NYSE: VER) announced today that on June 7, 2018, VEREIT, Inc. and VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (collectively ""VEREIT"" or the ""Company"") entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the ""Settlement Agreement"") to settle the previously disclosed litigation with Vanguard Specialized Funds, and other Vanguard funds serving as plaintiffs in the action pending in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona captioned Vanguard Specialized Funds, et al. v. VEREIT, Incorporated, et al., No. CV-15-02157-PHX-JAS (the ""Action"", and such plaintiffs, ""Vanguard""). Vanguard's claims arose out of the disclosures made by the Company in October 2014 and March 2015 regarding its financial statements, which included the Company's March 2015 restatement of certain of its previously issued financial statements. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the parties have agreed that Vanguard will dismiss all claims against the Company and the other defendants with prejudice and the Company will pay Vanguard the sum of $90 million in connection with the settlement of the claims. The Settlement Agreement contains mutual releases by both Vanguard and the Company, although the Company retains the right to pursue any and all claims against the other defendants in the Action and/or third parties, including claims for contribution for amounts paid in the settlement. The Settlement Agreement does not contain any admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties.VEREIT is pleased to have brought Vanguard's lawsuit to a conclusion. Vanguard's holdings accounted for approximately 13 percent of VEREIT's outstanding shares of common stock held at the end of the period covered by the various pending shareholder actions. In light of the fact that the Vanguard lawsuit was proceeding in a different federal district court than the other related cases pending against VEREIT, VEREIT believes that if the Vanguard lawsuit continued, it could find itself facing successive trials on similar factual and legal issues that could have subjected VEREIT to increased legal risk. Based on these factors and others, we believe that the settlement with Vanguard is in VEREIT's best interest.There can be no assurance as to whether or how this settlement may affect any potential future resolution of any other pending lawsuit, the timing of any such resolution, or the amount at which any other matter may be resolved."
"People are losing mind.VEREIT OWNS retailers Yes like Red lobster, but they also own Starbucks , Walgreens....and distribution centers like Amazon...if they a Corporate backed leases that means they pay rent regardless if individual stores close ...yes I know if they file for bankruptcy they may not have to pay...but if all these companies file BK no need to stock up on TP just use the money in your wallet."
I think we can anticipate additional dividend increases as the year progresses with the current payment so low.This should bring the SP up smartly. Interest rates this year probably won't be a factor until later in 4Q butit's something to keep a sharp eye on. Time for VER to shine! The market should recognize the scale of the portfolio and the progress of increasing earnings. Growth is on the agenda for 2021!
Big move on big volume. Settlement coming. Smart money is moving in to buy great value
The value proposition for VER has been increasing as the market sees progress in 2019
what's the angle for this reverse split?
Apparently this REIT is such a disaster that Bob Rufano deserves an $8.2 million compensation. Remarkable
woohoo!
"Can somebody explain their interest in this company? I agree they have a good concept of selling long-term leases to businesses, but the glaring fact is they've disposed of more properties than they've acquired new, which means the company is shrinking. For anybody invested in this, can you explain your reasons?"
VER reached a new 52 Week Low at 7.03
"It's evident through this transaction that VER is signaling a return to growth. The transformation is nearlycomplete. The market ""forgot"" that VER has one of the best triple net portfolios that has been repositionedaccording to the strategy laid down by the new CEO."
In Sept. 2019 Vereit sold 94.3 million shares of common at $9.40 per share. The shares now trade at half that price. Share buyback ??
"A little rain on the parade, sorry. Still under water as VER 2020 Return of Capital (ROC) was 100% compared to O's 18%, so glad to board - thanks for the invitation.."
"Volume coming in. MACD, KDJ and RSI are bullish, according to stoxline. On watch for clear above 7.15."
Needs to hold right here 8.00 or back to lows
Any thoughts on how much we might get per share in settlement?
Load up while it’s cheap...
I believe today is the cut off day for the upcoming dividend!
"What happened to Ver in the last week is amazing. IT was doing so well and coming out of its dreary performance for last couple of years and bang just like that it drops nearly a buck. After all the good news and rated up to a buy by many, it flounders again. It is perplexing. I wonder who out there can explain the sudden reversal? I have been with VER since ARPC bought it from Cole and watched the price jump to close to $15 then the horrible accounting error and it crashed. It has tried to recover got back up $11 several years ago. Still collecting the nice dividends but would sure like to see the price climbing again."
"Anyone notice how this stock tanked, after it announced the date of the next EPS conf. call? Thinking there was a leak. This is statistically improbably with zero news."
"Based on the the stock price action of the past week or so it's very apparent that news of thissettlement was leaked thus giving an advantage to buyers who had early access to this informationbefore the public announcement. This is the kind of thing that taints Wall St in the public eyes.Unfortunately, the SEC rarely takes action on this type of event unless there is a public outcry."
Is it fair to say stock is tanking because Glenn Ruffino tested positive for COVID-19?
Adding next week.Market is irrational is offering up a great value opportunity.
Management......ummm maybe from this point...a stock buy back should be considered?...best use of capital ?????
I think the smart money is betting on reasonably quicker settlement of the lawsuits. The market sentiment is much stronger and VER has a very strong portfolio with growth ready to resume. This stock will be a winner just by getting to a market multiple of its peers. The value is there and the lawsuits will be settled. The Vanguard settlement provides a pattern
VER upward movement while other REITS moving in the opposite direction in reaction to interest rates. Smart money insight into more lawsuits being settled?
"Interest rates going up,,,,looks like VER isn't reacting very well"
This once in a lifetime chance to pick up great company stocks at good prices. buy now. hold for years. reinvest dividends. Be like Warren.
dividend / AFFO ratio is terrific and over the next couple of years I expect it will improve
VER is up 11.04% to 5.33
Hello everyone is VER a good investment?
I WILL STILL SAY IT GOING TO $10.00 A SHARE SOON \
"yahoo finance now sucks.Speaking of awesome though, anyone sell VER when it popped to $11?. I sold in the high 9's. Looking to get back in now. Made some side trades, and have cap. How was the last earnings call?"
Monster volume looks like hedge/PE funds unwound some strategies today. You have to complementmanagement for getting this monkey off our back (albeit at a cost). What we should look for now isa resumption of growth in 2020 and fulfill the promises that the huge portfolio can unlock. It's amazingthat the shareholders have had to bear the burden of the few cheaters but that's our screwy legal system.VER is now one of the best values in REITdom. Even if we get 1/2 the Price/FFO that O gets we will be very happy.
I got proof of claim paper work in the mail. All I can say is wow what a job to figure all this out. Does anybody have any estimate of what a person would get per share they owned.
Does anyone expect to see a price spike on the day of the split?
"Dividend on new shares? It looks like VER will immediately return $13 million to the purchasers of the 94,300,000 share secondary offering. Secondary closed on 9/26/2019. Ex-dividend date is 9/27/2019"
Surprised this is not above $8
Accretive to buy their stock back as 7.28% dividend is higher then the cap rates they have been buying.
Seems like I made more money when this was $5 a share and going out of business. 2000 shares down to 200. 8% dividend. Down to 4%.
Made my 1st purchase @ 7.51...20 %
"why did Vereit drop so much the last two days? I can't find any bad news the last few days, but it is down .60 cents the last two days."
Recent market price indicates shorts are active due to interest rates changing. Reality is that over time REITs are not very sensitive to rates. Great value for the long term
know the story but first time owner. 100k shares at 4.15. Good Luck longs!
"Nearly 8% dividend, without any payment cuts this is hard to ignore"
"I SEE $10.00 VERY SOON,"
"VER just sold cole Capital. Earnings from Cole have lagged, so perhaps the revenue will be of more immediate value to VER. VER should also sell itself. They've said they would entertain suitors. That might be in the not to distant window. Could see Realty income picking them up. Hope so."
Class action lawsuits ---- Until these lawsuits are resolved the share price will continue to fall behind its peers like NNN and O. The question is whether the current stock price adequately reflects the loss due a class action settlement.
How do I ignore these Spammers?
The stock price is terrible. I suspect the hedge fund boys are taking a short position on the settlement being horrible. Let's hope they are very wrongManagement looks absent these days.
"hope you are right, Blacky. I also bought, yesterday, 2000 at 4.6893."
"There is a lot of market risk between here and the closing of the deal in 4Q21. The merger announcement ispulling up both stocks since VER is now linked with a fixed ratio to O. Once the Spinco goes out to shareholders the value of O (with the merged VER) will go down by the spin out. Then the market will assess the sum of the parts. They are putting the worst assets (office) into the spin. It's a crapshoot from here to have any idea of the value. When I look at my position it's getting better. If we get to the forecasted $53/shr and I add in the lawsuit payment, I will sell my shares. On a total income value I'll have a positive result when dividends are factored in. And I'm starting to raise cash and reduce the size of individual portfolio positions. Not all of the capital will be reinvested. Inflation is real. If the dollar falls the Fed will be forced to raise rates despite its statements to keep printing money until 2023. The place to look is not the 10YR but the 30YR bonds which the market controls and the Fed has little to no ability to influence. If the deal closes the scale of the combined company will bring many advantages. But if there is a market reset O can be bought at lower prices and a higher yield. O is getting pretty expensive but can go higher while rates remain low."
Looking forward to a great 2020. Good luck to all!!
Pathetic conversations. Is this partly due to this ridiculous new format? Why don't you spammers take a long walk off of a short pier?
"VEREIT Raised to Outperform From In-Line by Evercore ISI Group6:34 am ET September 30, 2019 (Dow Jones)"

"As an original ARCP holder, I didn't get back my cost on this merger...Oh well, O stock tends to move much more than VER anyways."
"CatalystsFollowing the equity offering and the recent debt offering, the company's balance sheet is under much better control and S&P has upgraded the operating LP credit rating to IG. Moody's isn't yet on board but I expect that they will be before too long.Don't look for any clarity from the lawsuit front. it will be a while before that can be quantified.However, it does appear that they are pretty close to finishing the asset sale process given the amount of new capital they have raised, which accelerated the balance sheet repair.Once they start acquiring properties again, I would imagine it won't be too long until they are able to start raising the dividend.Now THAT would be a catalyst.aa"
"Building up for another run, Real estate looking good"

"Dividend increase or share buyback? During the first 9 months of 2018 VER spent $50.1 million on the buyback of 7.2 million shares. If those funds had been used to pay an increased dividend, it would have amounted to $0.05 per share. Which is better? -- Dividend increase or fewer shares outstanding ?"
HOLDING UP VERY WELL
"yeah, I don't like the new format. And too many spammers"
Did anyone get a 1099 for the settlement distribution? Are we supposed to get one? Thanks for the feedback
Management;We need a catalyst !...shake things up !
VER is definitely under accumulation. If you compare O to VER it's no contest where the value is found.If VER closes the law suit soon then I would see the gap between O and VER start to close. O is a great company but way over priced
Clearly under distribution...if it breaks 9...it will retest the 7 -8 range
"The Street is upgrading VER to a Buy tomorrow, not sure what the price target is yet though."
Has anyone received any payout from the lawsuit that was resolved in January?
It appears the 4c accounting error is going to take 4 years to fix.
In reit stocks there always seems to be a couple that lag way behind. Eventually people start looking for a good buy in the group and the laggard gets discovered and catches up. REITs have been moving up since they bottomed early this year. So I expect the group in general to do well and if you hang on here you will get an extra bonus since it has some catching up to do.
They need to improve the divvy...with 3 more hikes coming.
"7.33% yield with the stock at $7.50 seems very very attractive.Being tarred with the retail brush is a bit overdone when they are so heavily exposed to office/industrial (30%) and restaurant (which is much less exposed to retail woes than other segments of retail).Could it go lower? You bet. Would that make it a better buy? Yup.The private market value is much higher, IMHO.aa"

Lots of saber rattling in the fed regarding increased rates, I think the end result is going to be few and very limited size increases - the reality is the fed is more or less trapped in the current low yield situation for the foreseeable future IMO. Soooooo I own VER and a smaller chunk of O and am thinking about increasing my position in one or the other. Leaning towards VER given the unmatched yield and SP ""value"". Any thoughts?"
"I have a deep feeling we are going to get screwed on the pay out, no answers when I call. E-mail them to call and they say No return calls are in the works. Wrote a letter to the Judge and got a reply. If you Google the firms name he's the mixed up with fraud in the case with real house wile's case. They tryed to reject my claim, had all the doc's and copys of my statements. I am going to write the judge again. Are they Bonded, who Audit's them. Mine adds up to over 7 K There must be a lot of left over moneY as I am sure a lot of holder's of small amounts did not file. I hear a batch of checks whent out in Feb, this is almost Aug.. WRITE THE JUDGE!"
Leaning into it into the close...methinks the shorts are about !
It was nice to see Vereit bounce back s little today. We're not back at the pre-split level though.
"Haha a few years ago moved most of my O position into VER, guess I'm back to O. Oh well, I'll take it!"
"Well, at least it recovered most of the drop. two REITS had bad reports yesterday and dropped 1.5% but today they came back around 2%. I just don't get it."
"82,000,000 shares sold in secondary at $9.50. Strong demand at not too big of a discount. This should put them in strong position to be more aggressive acquiring properties and starting to grow."
Where is the message board? Is this the new look?
100%...rents being negotiated....national lock down...matter of time
"Brought at $3.90 is this for real? Why are people throwing their stock out like ""Toilet Paper"" today? Am I the only one picking up ""Toilet Paper"" today. Crazy! Does VER's property and assets all of a sudden drop 30% in value in one day? GLTA VER Investors!"
what will the next dividend be and when will it be posted?
"Looks like great news: “However, our share price and multiple are still influenced by our last legacy issue litigation. On that front, the DOJ has indicated it will not bring criminal charges against the company. We are in discussions with the SEC, and we have settled with one of our opt-out lawsuits. We will manage the remaining litigation and do so with our stakeholders' welfare in the forefront.”"
this has made multiple bottoms right at 6.65...if they break it it could go down more...yikes !
VER reached a new 52 Week Low at 6.96
"Finally we are moving up recognizing the hard work the new CEO and his team have done to erase thedamage done to shareholders. I've held on to my 5,000 shares all these years and collected the dividends waiting for the lawsuit overhang to clear up. Now the market is back to looking at value created and it's finding a nice situation to put money towork. The portfolio repositioning is essentially complete so VER can look to resume growth. Over the next 2 years we should be celebrating one of the best returns to shareholders in REITdom. Management matters."
VER is booking .73 and paying out .55 so they are certainly putting away large sums every quarter. I think VER could boost shareholder value significantly with a small .01 increase in the dividend.
"With the 1st and 2nd check combined, they paid out 69.4% of the recognized loss. Higher than they estimated which is a very nice surprise. The first check didn't include DRIP shares but the 2nd check did and caught everything up. Those were my calculations."
Breakout! Breakout! Breakout!
Received a Litigation Check today. WOW! Watch your mail. Actually larger than the first one.
Close to 1 million on the sell side last 15 min.
Ver been moving up! Anyone know why?
"People keep worrying about the small battles and forget about winning the war. Vereit has done everything it said it would do to clean itself up and it has even done more. The debt issuance and equity issuance were major achievements without diluting shareholders. The upgrading of the portfolio with the moves away from Red Lobster have been done very well. The moves to get rid of flat leases were right on, now that we have an uptick in inflation coming. This management is doing the right things and now that the stock is back where it was before they proved themselves it is a bargain. Forget the rise in interest rates as a reason not to own VER. That makes no sense with it yielding 2% more than O. As VER proves itself more and as the lawsuit overhang is settled, there is a huge source of funds to fuel VER coming as many investors sell their other REITs that pay much less in Dividends and are already maxed out on their dividend."
why a reverse split? anyone?
Searching for a lawyer to sue Gilarti for denying my claim. Any suggestions?
I don't care for the new look on Yahoo finance. Is this really your idea of progress?
Can they recall the shares at the lower value? I had hold some shared Ver-f but then they recalled a partial at $25. When the market value is over $25. Can I sue them to get back the difference ?
What we are seeing is Ver buying back there own shares in the open market and an institution or two piggybacking on the buy. This Company is earnings positive right now and has a management team in place that is second to none when turning around a company. Cole capital is starting to really come on and with the new contracts signed and over a thousand new brokers pushing product.. I expect cole capital will be adding 2-3 cents for earnings. NO ONE is talking about the fact that when VER either sells or takes Cole public..how big of an impact it will have positively and it will be huge
Heard that legal action regarding suit to occur around 6/11 or 6/12. That might explain the sluggishness. Ver.P preferred might also take a hit. Subsequent buy might then be a good move. Ver legal overhang is the main reason stock is underperforming peers.
"is anyone holding the stock after the split , if you have 10,000 at closing price if 7.63 its worth 76,000..After split assuming its 5 for 1 that equals 38.00 or 2000 shares valued the same .Does anyone feel this stock will double at that valuation. These splits are designed to screw the shareholders. Just asking Thanks"
"If you had shares, your holding value stay the same after the reverse split. Now, it is down 2.5+%. I sold my shares at loss, should I be looking to back in after it drops some more?"
"Just wondering if anyone else has received a notice regarding the AR Capital Fair Fund? Sounds like another Class Action against ARCP execs. Small settlement compared to the other one, but real money. Does anyone else have any info on this?"
"Agree Jean. To date 35.3% of the eligible shares have settled with VER. Based on these settlements, the remaining 64.7% of eligible shares should come in at about $449.8 million. That is $0.47 per VER share. VER can easily cover this amount."
I just received the litigation check also today
ver going to 10 soon!?
"Vereit (VER) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks•February 4, 2020Investors might want to bet on Vereit (VER), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vereit-ver-upgraded-buy-heres-170005809.html"
Vereit going to $6 tomorrow after earnings call
"Panic selling with crazy SP. This looks like pricing for the end of the world. Unbelievable bargain for long termholders. Law suit settled and those of us who held shares are in for a payday soon. Judge has approved settlement terms. Lawyers 13%, shareholders 87%. Nice"
"So Vereit shares should open tomorrow at $38.50. Stockholders of record as of December 31, 2020 should see a dividend of .385 per share in January."
Fidelity has Vereit Inc. Very Bullish rated and 90% of the time they are spot on.
"Someone is accumulating today,looking for a new high."
"Nice to see 3 up days after 2 sharp down days. Still not at pre-split level yet, but the bleeding seems to have stopped at the moment."
"Moody's Moody's December 3, 2019Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") changed the outlook to positive from stable for VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (""VEREIT""), the main operating subsidiary of VEREIT, Inc. In the same rating action, Moody's affirmed the senior unsecured debt rating and its senior unsecured shelf rating at Baa3 and (P)Baa3, respectively."
Received a check today!!You have to be patient when waiting for these settlement checks.
snapshot looks good to me. Why does the market see it as bad?? They are doing as expected and moving in the right direction. If anything they should be up a percent not down on that news.
The virus panic in the market is astounding around VER since they have LONG TERM contracts in place locking in profitsand built in rent escalators. Their credit rating is quality and the management superb. This is a GREAT opportunityto pick up shares at a glaring discount to the intrinsic value.
We are definitely under attach here from the sell side on no visible news. The postponement to 2020 for the lawsuitresolution is likely weighing down the stock as the original date was September 2019. Don't know how to read thisbut market is seeing more risks short term. Still a good buying opportunity with a safe dividend.
The chart says 6.00 no kidding
have been so happy and trusting of management to this point. really believed rufano is the man to get this thing back to where it should have been 5 years ago. Without him we all take a huge loss. But he is calculating and knowledgeable. This secondary has to come with some reward for the long-standing long-suffering Equity holders.
Low interest rates are boosting REITs. VER is one of the best values in the space. We're going higher
"The 4th gain day in a row. I will continue to watch this stock closely, but I do feel a little better about the post split than I did a week ago."
"i am hoping they beat earning by 5%,go vereit"
Ummmm...VER can't be owned right now...we need to se how all this is going to shake out with bond market. Not specific to VER just in general to interest rate stocks.
I'm thinking tax selling season is driving down VER. On a relative basis it has had a decent recovery this year
Lets see how long it takes to get to 8.
"If anyone gets distribution from settlement, please post when you received it. My guess is towards the end of this year or early next year. Thanks"
"Is my math off or something?VER share holders will get .705 shares of O for every VER share they own.At today's close , O price was $64.98 and VER price is $44.58So, $64.98 X .705 is $45.81 (which is $1.23 less than VER's closing price).That means there's roughly a 3% discount right now with VER shares....Is that correct?What's the downside?...the merger doesn't go through and VER goes back to $41-$42 range?I'm just trying to understand if there is extra meat on the VER bone right now."
"I'm excited by the office reit spin. That sector is out of favor now for sure. The price will drop after the spin and then I'll buy more. Office will come back in time. I bought Vornado a few weeks ago at $45 and it's up 10%. Buy low and sell high, collect dividends in the meantime!"
Accumulation
VER is it time in 2019 for finally some growth in the stock price?The lawsuits appear to be coming to an end? Does any know if this is correct?
Accretive to buy their stock back as 9% dividend is higher then the cap rates they have been buying. (Update to Brian's post)
I am buying as part of my regular investment program. It can remain down here a short time. load up. We will go higher. no one knows when.
"The way I understand the GOP tax bill is it would make properties, like those owned by VER, more valuable, because it allows owners set up as a pass-through to deduct 2.5% of the purchase price of the property, which allows the owners to shelter more of the pass-through income from federal taxes.Bloomberg article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/trump-real-estate-investors-get-last-minute-perk-in-tax-bill?srnd=4468916321"
"According to the current slide deck, VER gets only 0.2% of rent from apparel and ""specialty"" retail tenants."
bought a starter position today ( thousand at 4.69) after studying I felt the dividend was safe and ad the country eventually comes back on line there should be demand for what they offer
The letter that I received said that we will receive a post card claim & that we do not need to file a new claim. Civil Action No. 1:15-mc-0040-AKH
PT on this stock is $10.5 but I think it should be $12. Nice tax beneficial dividend with great management.
"Buying properties at 6% cap rates and selling properties in the 7s is not a sustainable strategy. i hope there's more to the story, like getting rid of properties with flat leases and acquiring ones with built-in rent increases."
Opened the mail today with a big surprise check. I assume that this is the final distribution as they have had 18 months to go through and validate claims. A bigger check than the first is quite a surprise but I guess the first check had to be conservative to guard against a large last minute claim. The pace of distribution is glacial but these awards are very large compared to typical lawsuits. I think mine is over $2.50/share
based on the earnings and assets this company is cheap.I can see over $10 value unless their is something I cant see.
let's get V E R back to 11 for a share price it's hoovering around high 7's and low 8's we can do better. :)
I have held this stock directly for a long time. Had purchased it before the accounting issue. Would I be entitled to any distribution from the settlement? Do I need to file anything? Is it too late? Thanks
"Guys common!!!!! lots of complaints and grumbling about up 5 cents or down 10 cents. This is a turn around play pure and simple!!!! these turnarounds take time and the ride is always going to be bumpy. if you are going to sweat a 5 or 7% up or down quarter, you should be invested in con ed or duke. the management of this REIT inherited a disaster! Accounting issues and self dealing by the previous management. They have done a sterling job of cleaning up the balance sheet and refinancing. they have gotten the credit upgraded by the ratings agencies and disposed of underperforming assets. They have made huge strides in returning the company to financial health. patience!"
All these losers and their ridiculous spam messages. Yahoo Finance continues to devolve. Has there any company that has squandered more customers and customer loyalty than Yahoo. t
