"I called today about filing the paperwork for the ARCP lawsuit again, and was told that if we filed it previously and received a payout that we don't have to file it again since they have the info."

"I just received my ARCP settlement checks today vis USPS. I held the stock in 5 accounts and received 5 separate checks. Letter states this is my ""initial distribution of the Net Settlement Fund"". No insight provided into what that means. Checks are for 62% to 66% of what I guesstimated I would receive. I am guessing this ""initial distribution"" is for 2/3 of my expected final settlement."
"If anyone gets distribution from settlement, please post when you received it. My guess is towards the end of this year or early next year. Thanks"
Dumped 20% of my Vereit shares and purchased preferred shares of HMLP-PA for it's November dividend 9.35% annual.
Did any of you receive the latest letter regarding the ARCP class-action lawsuit? I already received the two payouts. Are we going to receive another one? Thanks.
This is a sell
VEREIT reached a 52 Week high at 51.49
Talked to settlement admin today and checks are expected to go out 1st quarter of 2021.
"So O/VER management dumps the details of the split 2 business days before the merger closes on Nov 1. They have known these details for a long time. My put is this is going to be disruptive since the Orion stub will losethe economy of scale of the two parent organizations. O gains scale, Orion loses therefore shareholders of theOrion stub will be losers since their cost of capital will be much higher. Capitol costs are the key metric thatdetermines the safety and security of dividends since spreads are much larger for bigger organization. AndOrion will not be investment grade out of the gate. O/VER are dumping the worst assets onto the backs ofOrion shareholders. That's why I sold my VER shares. I think O is a bit overpriced and Orion shares will be dumped onto the market"
"VER just sold cole Capital. Earnings from Cole have lagged, so perhaps the revenue will be of more immediate value to VER. VER should also sell itself. They've said they would entertain suitors. That might be in the not to distant window. Could see Realty income picking them up. Hope so."
I just received the litigation check also today
snapshot looks good to me. Why does the market see it as bad?? They are doing as expected and moving in the right direction. If anything they should be up a percent not down on that news.

Opened the mail today with a big surprise check. I assume that this is the final distribution as they have had 18 months to go through and validate claims. A bigger check than the first is quite a surprise but I guess the first check had to be conservative to guard against a large last minute claim. The pace of distribution is glacial but these awards are very large compared to typical lawsuits. I think mine is over $2.50/share
For every 10 shares you get one free one and dividend .
"Is my math off or something?VER share holders will get .705 shares of O for every VER share they own.At today's close , O price was $64.98 and VER price is $44.58So, $64.98 X .705 is $45.81 (which is $1.23 less than VER's closing price).That means there's roughly a 3% discount right now with VER shares....Is that correct?What's the downside?...the merger doesn't go through and VER goes back to $41-$42 range?I'm just trying to understand if there is extra meat on the VER bone right now."
"According to my calculations, the first distribution was $1.32 and the second $1.73. Total of $3.05 per share. I would think there could be another closeout distribution to clean up uncashed checks etc. Maybe a nice lunch or beer money, not much more."
stock has been doing better than O percentage wise over past month and 3 months. So I think it has a good chance to have the market treat it for what it is worth and not past mistakes.
"This is why lawyers are so hated. I sent an inquiry to the law firm about the settlement. This is what I got back. My guess: they have 2 Jr clerks processing the claims; This is one of the most outrageous answers I've ever seen. I guess this poor law firm is doing this by hand instead of using these new marvelous inventions called computers. The longer it takes my put is the more money they will charge. Hopefully, most of us will still be alive to collect. ""We are currently processing claims for this matter. Processing time on our cases can take an average of 9 to 12 months from the January 23, 2020 submission deadline. Once processing is complete, we must then wait for authorization from Lead Counsel and/or the Court before we can distribute the funds which can take several additional months. Please understand that this is an estimated timeframe for processing based on our experience which does not guarantee that all case processing will be completed within twelve months. Processing time varies from case to case and some cases may take more or less based on the specifics of that case settlement. """

"This is the last week for Vereit. It's been a wild ride. Came into it looking for stable dividends. Instead, got an accounting scandal, lawsuit, settlement, renaming of company, etc, etc.Glad to have made money on this in the end. Good riddance to this one."
Great report today and 20% increase to dividend. I bought this on the way down at the start of pandemic for the 7% yield before div cut. With the latest increase I am above 4% yield on my basis. Much less painful now and can comfortably hold for a good long while. Current price yields 4.8% ish dividend yield. Future looking much better here and decent inflation hedge from my perspective.

"New one year high today on big volume. Lower interest help but VER is still undervalued compared to its peers NNN, O, WPC and others."
"Nearly 8% dividend, without any payment cuts this is hard to ignore"
Received a Litigation Check today. WOW! Watch your mail. Actually larger than the first one.
Shucks! Left money on the table as I sold my last shares at $50.25 a few days ago.But leaving happy. I think there is short term price risk in O shares due to the loweringof price with the spinout/distribution of the retail properties. This will cause confusion and make O a better entry point. Too expensive now/market top for O. O acts like a bond equivalentin the short term so as the Fed starts to unravel the easy money policies we will see better prices.I'm holding the cash from this trade for a while.
Received a check today!!You have to be patient when waiting for these settlement checks.
"People are losing mind.VEREIT OWNS retailers Yes like Red lobster, but they also own Starbucks , Walgreens....and distribution centers like Amazon...if they a Corporate backed leases that means they pay rent regardless if individual stores close ...yes I know if they file for bankruptcy they may not have to pay...but if all these companies file BK no need to stock up on TP just use the money in your wallet."
"As an original ARCP holder, I didn't get back my cost on this merger...Oh well, O stock tends to move much more than VER anyways."
Hopefully we will see a modest dividend increase in 2020 as growth resumes

"With the 1st and 2nd check combined, they paid out 69.4% of the recognized loss. Higher than they estimated which is a very nice surprise. The first check didn't include DRIP shares but the 2nd check did and caught everything up. Those were my calculations."
VER is it time in 2019 for finally some growth in the stock price?The lawsuits appear to be coming to an end? Does any know if this is correct?
The letter that I received said that we will receive a post card claim & that we do not need to file a new claim. Civil Action No. 1:15-mc-0040-AKH

I think we can anticipate additional dividend increases as the year progresses with the current payment so low.This should bring the SP up smartly. Interest rates this year probably won't be a factor until later in 4Q butit's something to keep a sharp eye on. Time for VER to shine! The market should recognize the scale of the portfolio and the progress of increasing earnings. Growth is on the agenda for 2021!
"As a long time O shareholder, I can say welcome on board. Not sure I am impressed with VERâ€™s past performance, but I have faith in our board."
Selling to reduce my position after holding for many years. With settlement and dividends over many yearsI have positive returns (even if small). I'm not confident that post merger that the office stub won't lower the overall value I think O is a great company but it's really significantly overvalued once the Fed starts tapering in 2022. O has a great management team but buying in a these high prices is very risky
