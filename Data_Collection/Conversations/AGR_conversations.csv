AGR is in talks to buy PNM. PNM was under $40 toward the end of Sept. and is now $46.
Goldman initiates AGR as a buy with $60 target. Sees annual dividend growth at 8% through 2020. AGR previously stated that they will increase the dividend in 2018. Should we not see an announcement soon ?
AGR and PPL merger scheduled talks for Q3 2020.
"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
Can anyone here comment on the BOEM under a new (Biden) administration and how this might impact the Vineyard timeline? Is 2022 completion likely or even possible?
Any update on status of Vineyard Wind offshore project?
This stock functions just like a bond. The dividend has not changed for at least the last 18 years according to Value Line.
I hope to someday hear vineyard wind is approved by Feds and operating. It might require a new US administration.
"Still waiting for the increase in the div. that was promised when AGR took over UIL, a promise that was again expressed two years ago."
A blowout on earnings.
"Director A. Solomont has bought for 49,69 on Wednesday. So we have a lot of space to rise up.Nice company, nice future... IMO."
PPL and AGR $67B merger talks rumored to have resumed.
Should have nice cost savings with PPL - just hope they don't overbid.
"The ""MERGER"" is really a CASH BUYOUT with tax consequences for PNM holdersBetter to give PNM holders stock in AGR; no cap gain taxes then, = a true ""merger"""
"VANGRID’S New England Clean Energy Connect Receives Final Major Permit and Announces Start of ConstructionPresidential Permit from the US Department of Energy allows for trans-border crossing of renewable hydropower transmission line from Canada to the USJanuary 15, 2021 12:26 PM Eastern Standard TimeAwesome news!"
"Interesting how it was the Sierra Club that was biggest opponent of building a transmission line that would transport green, renewable energy and would replace fossil fuel sources."
GOOD NEWS !! AGR sells 80% of Coyote Ridge Wind Farm. They should have given the buyer the whole thing. Wind is the most ineffective/costly means of electric generation yet devised by man.
Any news on the transmission line in Maine?
I am most interested in the offshore Vineyard Wind project.
"This is a good read (Forbes – Nov 5, 2018) regarding how the existing energy infrastructure will impact the future growth of electrical vehicles and how “electrical companies across the country could reap financial benefits from high penetration of electrical vehicles.” Researchers at the UT Austin stated that the infrastructure of California and Maine could be impacted compared to Texas which has a “Robust grid.” https://www.forbes.com/sites/ftodddavidson/2018/11/05/electric-vehicles-are-coming-and-new-england-and-california-better-watch-out/#49edc9ff2c41"
