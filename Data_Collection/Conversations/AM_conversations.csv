Gotta love a day like this. Just made a nice paper 30k since yesterday's close. And now the dividend.
Charles...sold a few puts this morning offsetting calls. we will see how this works. but for now my bank account is happy
"with hedges in place for the rest of this year and 50% for next year revenue should be OK. The good news is growing volume, reduced leverage, increased dividends and an improved balance sheet combined with super economies in the field reducing drilling and expenses should result in better returns to shareholders. I think the price action is way overdone making AM a good speculative buy. With an incredible yield you are now paid for the risk. Because computers do most of the trading and exaggerate market directions I will likely wait a week of so to see if the dust settles before adding to my position. As the coverage ration improves the dividend should become more secure. Management has the message, deleverage before the market does it for you."
"Today is a perfect day why I don't use stops on a stock that I believe in. I'm sure many people got ""stopped"" out on this morning's volatile activity."
Why didnt I buy more :(
Is the dividend safer than a lot of other pipelines ?
"Dude, where's my dividend ?"
"Looking at the ""Holders"" tab, it's easy to see that very nearly 33% of common stock is held by insiders. That single fact generates some rather interesting questions, namely:That's quite a high percentage, isn't it ...? That said, those insiders must be reaping millions of dollars in dividends every quarter, right ...? Those two questions lead to the third - and most interesting - question, namely: What are you waiting for ...?"
Got your dividend check yet? How important is a dividend to you?

Am I reading correctly that the dividend is dropping to $.90?
AM announces $300M buyback program. Says it will not impact its financial profile.
"Hello fellow investors,Is this dividend sustainable?After seeing BP cut their divy in half I am just questioning it.Thanks!"
Antero Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 11.34
Well 11.40 would put me up 100%. Basis is 5.70. one can only hope
sell before eX buy back day of record holding would make more monies than dvy. May have to think about that 4qtr
"Serious Question - Would you guys reccomend this for a long term, 10+ years, hold? I'm looking to make some additions to my retirement portfolio and would like some nice long term holds with good dividends. Looks like a steady dividend payment, but the price over the 2 and 5 year has been dropping. Is this worth adding to my long term investments?"
"I listened to both AR and AM calls and looked through the deck. From the questions asked and the presentation material, its obvious they intend to keep their feet on the pedal. Full speed ahead, damn the NG prices. There were questions related to cutting back on production to balance the market and live within cash flow.Their response was the Firm transport commitments made on pipelines and contracts with 3rd parties means they have keep raising production otherwise they will be paying for pipeline capacity they dont use. There is also efficiency aspect, both capital efficiency and operational efficiency with growing production and scale. They have 2 years of good hedges so no worries on NG side. The liquids pricing will fluctuate with oil prices but with Mariner 2 pipe, they are getting improved setbacks and a huge shell plant coming on line in 3 years is going to be a great demand for all this NGL production. They see their DCF coverage improve to > 1.3x beyond 2020. I think its a little optimistic but > 1.2 should be doable. They have enough liquidity to make it through the 2021 maturity wall, it might result in higher interest on the rolled over bonds but its manageable. They are reducing their costs dramatically and there have been lots of quiet lay offs. They have also reduced the rig count over time. I think these guys can ride it out through to 2023-24 given their conservatism but if NG prices and NGL prices remain low for that long then they may have some difficulty. Either NG or NGL pricing has to recover somewhat and they are able to survive. AR just needs to survive (and not make any profit) for AM to be successful. CEO and CFO own many more shares of AM then AR so you know where they are aligned. Frankly this is overdone at 14% dividend. Usually 14% dividend implies near term trouble and/or dividend cut. Neither is in the cards, it will recover back to 10-11% or more in short order, but ALGOS and trade war fears may drag this down even more."

"To get to a 10% yield, either the dividend is cut to 80 cents, or the share price rises to $12. If you've looked at the futures prices for nat gas and NGL's, demand will exceed supply, so the volumes processed by AM will not go down. Hence, the fees earned by AM will remain steady or rise. If that's the case, I see a 10% yield on a $12 share price, not the other way around."
"Heavy volume, were traders buying the dvy? Will it go down after eX? Whatever it went the right direction today"
So who is planning to reinvest the dividend? No drip program but you can still compound that 10% dividend.
Is phats the new Arturo?
"Although bought at various times, my average purchase price is about $6/share. However, being an avid but not overly strict follower of Benjamin Graham, I feel somewhat ""incentivized"" to sell all shares if/when share price attains $9/share (that is, a 50% gain in share price. However, the quarterly dividend remains rather attractive, blunting a bit Graham's advice. L/T vs. S/T capital gains are a negligible concern.So, should I sell at $9/share or continue to hold the shares for its dividend ? - Any thoughts ...?"
so we think the spill isnt gonna gut this tommorow lol
shorts will have to pay dividend. Nice return on investment for longs.
Strange share price development today.Has there been someone all the time at 10.90 collected / supported or repelled / capped?

"Yesterday, up 3.2% from the low on high turnover. From a chart perspective, this looks like a price reversal.Price performance since high in the last 8 weeks -17% or -15.8% taking into account the dividend discount. NG price during this period +5.6%, although the high was reached later.Significant underperformance of the share compared to the NG price (-22.6%/ -21.4%), which is by the way even much higher for other companies (e.g. AR, SMLP, EQT).ER was not bad at all, taking into account the special effects, so it can hardly be the reason for this weak performance. Neither can future prospects, because these would then also be recognizable in the NG price.So my only explanation is that many of those who entered at low prices have recently ""cashed out"". Let's see when they get back in. In any case, I used yesterday to stock up."
getting ready to double up and collect a lot more dividends
sec docs said they sell at open market
Anyone buying with the 10% yield?
"added a few shares today, great long term possibilities."
Panic in the AM! Buy on the discounted price!
Nice up day for NG. AM will trend back up.
GS downgrades AM to sell with a $7.50 price target. I disagree with their assessment. Time will tell who is correct.
Nothing fundamentally has changed for this stock in the last 3 trading days other than the price.
"I’ve been buying since 2.50. If you believe we’ll be using NG for the next 15-20 years this is a tremendous opportunity to set up a 25% yield for retirement. I have 58,000 shares avg $2.00 yield 59%. Still at $5 im adding prob 22k more to 80,000 which will pay $98,400 income/yr without raising the dividend. $226k total cost yields 43.5%. I can retire on this."

is today ex dividend day?
"Thank you, AM, again for letting me make as much in a few days as the dividend would be worth in a year. Buy in fear, sell in strength."
Don't pinch me!! I don't want to wake up
Gotta feel pretty good about today. Anyone feel different about AM?
Been buying every dip on this stock for weeks. Feeling pretty happy about that decision today.
Why announce no shares buy back in Q3? The info seems out of place for a PR announcing the divvy....only thing I read out of that is they're trying to signal they have not forgotten or given up and shares buyback and may in fact be setting money aside to do that....coming up!
Back once again to AM. Was I missed LOL. I treat AM as a preferred of AR and trade based on a ratio between the shares. Last trade was in the 1.3 and 1.4 ratios but AR has moved higher as most of you know. So today was a 1.6 ratio swap and dang the price has risen nicely since my entry. Do luv the sweet sweet dividend but I love sp appreciation even more.. Anyone care to share their strategy for this stock. Just own a few thousand shares these days of AM. Always fun and educational to share investment thoughts.
"Basicaly a buyback makes sense here, it means managment does not have to spend on dividends"
"25k shares @2.05, almost a year divvy paid, another year and stock for free, payed by divvy....Lol"

Got an underweight at Morgan Stanley but price target raised to 9. Beats GS's sell and 7.50 target. Have to see which if either of the big dogs is more right?
Antero Midstream is up 4.98% to 9.70
"I was initially upset at the dividend cut but I chose to stay on board with my position. The market's judgment is clearly in favor of management. With a remainder 10% dividend the cut will strengthen the company and the dividend ""loss"" is being returned in the form of capital appreciation. It's not always true that a dividend cutis a SP disaster. Kudos to the executives!"
JP Morgan Chief equity analyst is bullish on energy going forward! He has been more right than not over the last few years!
"Like most here I’m disappointed to see the dividend reduced by 27%. But as others have pointed out, its not because the business is trending in the wrong direction. In fact, its very much the opposite situation. The AR business is picking up and that’s forcing AM to increase Capex significantly. The long term result will be significantly lower debt and significantly higher FCF. At some point these moves will result in additional increases to AM’s credit rating. These moves should result in greater long term EV for AM. So where does the stock go from here ? When ET cut its distribution in half last October the stock dropped 15% and bottomed 10 days later. After 30 days it had recovered to pre announcement levels. 30 days later it was 15% higher. I would expect a similar pattern from AM except I suspect the drop will be a little less than 15% and the bounce above pre announcement levels will be more muted. I still feel the stock will hit $12 at some point this year which would give it a yield of 7.5%. That yield would be comparable to WES, DCP and slightly better than ET which has $72B of debt and a 5X debt load."
"Looks like Glen (10 million) and Paul (18 million) sold shares. I'm guessing that they sold them back to the company as they were at a discount. They still own a lot but, looks like about 2/3rds of their holdings. Will probably hear more in the AM."
AM has had a good run but is falling behind AR by quite a bit. I suppose the dvy reduction took it's toll
"Hello everyone,At first glance, AM's ER is somewhat disappointing, but this is due to various special effects. In essence-One-off expense of 20.7 million from the debt restructuring from SN24 to SN29.-5.1 million negative tax effect.108.9 million, adjusted earnings were almost 7% higher than a year earlier.Operationally, there has been a significant improvementRevenue +11% / EBIDTA +12%Net debt to last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was reduced from 3.7x to 3.6x. The bottom line is not as weak as it looks at first glance."
This has been very good to be But. am wondering if I should have bought the other Antero. shoulda coulda woulda
"Life is good with AM. Paid $2.64, collected .3075 x4=1.23 46%, and shares are now $8.00 for 203% gain...still long. GLTA"
"Well it's back to pre crash level, with a fantastic yeild.Energy stocks all dropped a little it seems.Volatile market fluctuation, is probably all it is, I went ahead and added more, as I am hopeful it will go up to $12 or higher, the div. 1.23 annually so 10% would be @ $12.30 per share. Very reasonable target in my estimations, and it's been at that level before. Debt. doesn't seem to be and issue, crude and gas prices both slowly increasing, no preferred shares, lots of insider ownership, looks solid to me."

"Must confess. Yep Fidelity got me as a pattern day trader and won't allow me to purchase AM-- says too risky. Moving my accounts to another broker. Can't get an answer as to why AM is so risky given the Moody's upgrade and strong free cash flow guidance. While this debate with Fidelity is going on, AM sp keeps rising....mmmm... not happy with Fidelity."
About time for this one to start to move up again.
Warm Autumn is forecast. Bearish for demand
"This is a very strange, fishy situation. The ex dividend date is 8 days away and it pays 43%. Why would anybody sell it with the price rising?"
"NG price currently at 4.19 today plus 6.9%. The highest level since mid-January 2019! Unfortunately does not help the price of the AM share and the shares of all other companies related with gas at all. The fact that despite this price jump at NG today ALL fall, and have been performing significantly worse for almost two months, I can not explain with any known information. Only with ""games"" or information that the major market players have ahead of us."
Hmmm. Gonna be back over $6 real soon I’d say
"After a nice run up in the recent past,is it time to take some profits? Opinions?Is AR an early indicator?"
"Imo, AM in some ways is similar to ET. Both make $, can cover their distributions, and did NOT cut their dividend. ET still has a 21% divvy, but with AM sporting around 36%, this is the better BUY right NOW!"

"No div. cut. The Board of Directors of Antero Midstream declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per share for the third quarter of 2021, or $0.90 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend will be payable on November 10, 2021 to stockholders of record as of October 27, 2021."
"Received divvy today! Always nice! In @2,05 one your from now, the divvy payed the share. Money for free, crazy world "
"Seeking Alpha article of this morning- some good data but suspect conclusions. Notes AM is in growth mode but notes-- surprise- reliance on one major customer, doesn't own the jv but has 1.3 dividend coverage and debt that is lower than most midstreams. All of that to warn of a possible dividend cut without any supporting information. So if your crystal ball is a bit clearer or actually has some hard data-- you too could be a Seeking Alpha writer. Today's was written by somehing/someone called Power Hedge. Mho-- no new information and no supporting information- just a feeling picked out of the air."
"I think its worth picking up some shares at $9Michael Boyd:Appalachian natural gas production, absent an outright collapse in natural gas pricing, is assuredly heading higher.While the bull/bear case for E&Ps might be mixed on that outlook, pipelines assuredly benefit.Despite heavy exposure to gathering and processing assets and heavy reliance on Antero Resources, the firm has a great risk/reward profile."
Need your advice please if I buy today AM will I get the dividend
AM decent Q. Some issues remain but results overall were pretty impressive. Another adjustment in Capex in 2H20 will have positive cash flow impact. This management team looks on top of things. Investors should reward them with a higher SP
"This is NOT a stock to short imo. Imagine what kind of day this one will have, if they come out an affirm the dividend, as ET did?"
"The yield action with bonds will either:A) Normalize after a while and the whole market will stabilize. Meaning the bubble just let out some airB) The fed steps in (most likely, since Sleepy Joe, needs to sell bonds for his 1.9T stimulus, and Fed need to grease that up)My guess is after a week option a or b plays out and we are back to normal.The next bust is happening when interest rates go up. This isnt it."
"DENVER, April 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Antero Midstream Corporation (""Antero Midstream"") today announced that the Board of Directors of Antero Midstream declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per share for the first quarter of 2021. In addition, Antero Midstream announced plans to issue their first quarter 2021 earnings on Wednesday, April 28, 2021 after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange."
"Interesting FCEL is up 18% today. No dvy , no real income. You cant beat fun"
52 week high!!
"If I read it correctly, they actually delivered free cash flow after distributions. Only $12 million, but still, that’s impressive"
"OK, so the dividend was reduced. Am obviously not pleased with that. However, in reading thru their recent filings and announcements, I am finding it troublesome that AM seems to be ""speaking out of both sides of its mouth"". - BTW, your thoughts and opinions are welcome. Here goes ...1. AM has stated (in the Exhibit 99.1 attached to its 8-K report to the SEC, file 17 FEB 2021) that they are ""reallocating a portion of the dividend payment"" to fund infrastructure projects. They further state therein that: ""This reallocation is expected to allow Antero Midstream to internally fund these attractive rate of return projects without adding leverage or total debt.""2. As recently as 10 NOV 2020 another 8-K was filed with SEC in which AM announced the ""creation of a direct financial obligation"" for $550M in an apparent ""private placement"" (i.e. 7.875% Notes not available to the security-buying public). So, this debt was created very recently.It seems to me that despite AM's most recent assertion that they didn't want to add to their total debt, they were perfectly willing to do precisely that in Nov 2020. Why couldn't the funds from November's debt offering be used to support the just announced ""infrastructure projects""?Anyone else find this troublesome? - Thanks for your thoughts."
"Is this dividend safe? Looking to get into AM (although I missed the latest dividend, oh well). Thanks!"
Does anyone know if the dividend on this stock was reduced?
Antero Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 11.65
I am genuinely interested in buying shares into this company so I am not trying to seem like I'm down on this company. I want to ask if the 114% payout ratio is concerning?
"Double bottom is in. We're good to head up from here. Div is solid besides, Looking very good."
"Simple question, does AM issue K-1 or 1099? Will appreciate your response."
I would expect it to gained back what it lost. Not sure why it slid. (iddenBa)Volatile can be a money maker. I've picked up a few more shares.
Someone needs to inform Arturo that he can quit ranting that the dividend is not sustainable because its 15%. Its only 13.5% now.
"No. We really haven't thought about changing the dividend. Obviously, we haven't increased it and we don't plan on increasing it. Like I mentioned, the return of capital is going to come in the form of buying back shares. So when you actually look at our model, we highlighted that the trend of the capital going much lower and then you have the EBITDA growth that kind of meres AR's growth plans, your coverage goes up to the 1.2 to the 1.3 range, so that's really not a profile that would lend itself to be reducing the dividend.You also kind of lookout in '21, '22, the cash flow plus the dividend payout -- cash flow, excuse me, less the dividend payout, less the capital is about at parity, you're almost free cash flow after dividend. So again, not a profile that would suggest that you would be needing to cut any of the dividends. So we don't see that in the future. We just plan on holding it flat and then returning capital through buying back shares. If it just stays down at these low prices, we'll just be opportunistic and get a lot of shares in."
Is it me or do you think its odd the stock trades lower before the ex div tomorrow?

Some of you don't understand how this works. The company condition is not necessarily correlated to the share price especially with $AM to the C. Just keep buying the stock and don't preach buy the dip. Momentum is key. And don't even get me started with options....
"Okay a question? AR said it will reduce its rig count from 4 to 1 in the second quarter, so am I correct in assuming there will be less volume going through AM in the second quarter? Meaning a lesser payout? Did I miss anything?"

Looks to be fear of a dividend cut that may happen but not as deep as expected or it could be worse. This management is difficult to predict. This is the dividend they were going to grow just 6-9 months ago so who know. Maybe they increase it! Lol that would be hysterical to watch that short covering.

"It’s admittedly fascinating to me that this stock has gone from under $2 to $8+ in 6 months, a 5x with minimal comment. Amazing. Indifference mostly, but also short negativity overhang. There is no other overhang. This stock should go to $12+. It’’s still a steal for $8+, bu that’s 50% below of where it should be. What an opportunity. Buy buy buy. Dead board. Liven up!"

Fine results. Don't be confused by the impairment; something to be expected by experts. The dividend is secure. The stock should go up a lot the coming weeks.
"Is the dividend safe for 2020, what are your thoughts?"
The price of this stock will be demand-driven. I'd check out the news regarding demand for natural gas throughout the world. Demand has increased significantly.
Kinda mad. Only got to about 85% of goal before it popped. Not sure I will get another chance and won't chase it up. Oh well.
Is this a sign of things to come this afternoon? Yesterday was brutal
During the conference call management sad they expect higher dividend after the capex for AR new drilling project.
" BBIG 36Millions MASSIVE short interest and 48M float, this will EASILY shoot up to $AM levelsif everyone buy and HOLD !!"
Dividend declared. All good.

AM CEO did not sell his shares. He gifted them to charity. Read footnotes on SEC Form 4.
How did they positive eps but negative fcf after divi?
Well so much for debt reduction. Announcement this morning of intent to place 650 millions in new senior notes. Stated objective to roll the 2024s and pay down bank line. So what is happening to the fcf?
"Surprised it's not listed on this thread yet - sales were to satisfy tax liabilities from the conversion transaction last Spring. All other executives sold over $12.50 to raise cash to satisfy the obligation. They didn't want to sell, held out, and now have to sell at a lower price to satisfy tax bill coming due in a month or two. Very understandable reason for sales. Timing unfortunate."
Seeing the first indications of propane shortages....restrictions on heating water for swimming pools.. oh no..a cold dip in the pool. lol.
What happened to AM today?
"We been having a pretty productive discussion last couple of days-- regarding the dividend cut and abandonment of supply constraints. It has been my position-- in addition to taking it in the shorts on income and on a small position of my holdings (did buy a few shares at 9.42 and more in the low 9s) that management has been erratic in terms of following through with written protocols-- a la supporting the dividend and maintaining supply restraints. So let me ask you, how important is it to you that you can trust what a management says is it policies and goals?For the record- and as a value investor-- let me refer to one of the great value investors-- Warren Buffet. Mr. Buffet says year after year he will only invest in companies that he has trust in the management. Right or wrong?"
"Happily, just keeps chugging higher."
Does anyone here believe AM will raise the dividend before next year? They have been saying next year but it seems there is some possibility for this year with all the FCF at AR and the desire to increase production at these gas prices.
