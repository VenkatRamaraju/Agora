52 week high!!
Anyone buying with the 10% yield?
Well 11.40 would put me up 100%. Basis is 5.70. one can only hope
sell before eX buy back day of record holding would make more monies than dvy. May have to think about that 4qtr
Some of you don't understand how this works. The company condition is not necessarily correlated to the share price especially with $AM to the C. Just keep buying the stock and don't preach buy the dip. Momentum is key. And don't even get me started with options....
"Interesting FCEL is up 18% today. No dvy , no real income. You cant beat fun"
AM I correct in seeing a 3200 support for ethereum? $WIT $4882.T $NWBO $AR $AM $NRGU
What happened to AM today?
"No div. cut. The Board of Directors of Antero Midstream declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per share for the third quarter of 2021, or $0.90 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend will be payable on November 10, 2021 to stockholders of record as of October 27, 2021."
How did they positive eps but negative fcf after divi?
Antero Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 11.65
Strange share price development today.Has there been someone all the time at 10.90 collected / supported or repelled / capped?
Massively undervalued.
Antero Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 11.34
"Simple question, does AM issue K-1 or 1099? Will appreciate your response."
so we think the spill isnt gonna gut this tommorow lol
Good $AM article on SA just came out. I'll try replying to this post with a link and see if Yahoo lets me do it (it usually doesn't).
russia putin brakes on nat gas. 40% eu nat gas comes from the very same country america spends billions protecting from?
No correction in sight. $BNKU banks $NRGU oil $TMV rising 20+ yr treasury $SPXL s&p 500 ..all 3x leveraged.$AR $AM $OCCI $DNP $REML $NWBO
" BBIG 36Millions MASSIVE short interest and 48M float, this will EASILY shoot up to $AM levelsif everyone buy and HOLD !!"
Does anyone here believe AM will raise the dividend before next year? They have been saying next year but it seems there is some possibility for this year with all the FCF at AR and the desire to increase production at these gas prices.
Is this a sign of things to come this afternoon? Yesterday was brutal
Antero Midstream is down 4.94% to 11.10
"It's been a great couple of weeks, The volume seems low for the amount of gain. I would think more people would be buyin in."
AM has had a good run but is falling behind AR by quite a bit. I suppose the dvy reduction took it's toll
ETJH-USD up $200 approximately since the U.S. market session close. 10:18pm. $3597.64 $NRGU 4WIT $ADA-USD $DOT1-USD $ETH-USD $AM $AR
This has been very good to be But. am wondering if I should have bought the other Antero. shoulda coulda woulda
Shorts squeeze will be EPIC. Even bigger than $ATER $AM or $GME.
$10 POKS !
"3 biggest $ETC-USD transactions in Oct were buys. Things are looking up for Ethereum Classic to close the gap up to $ETH-USD. $NRGU, $RIOT, $REML. $AR, $AM, $FLNG, $TMV, $SLVO"
Antero Midstream is up 4.98% to 9.70
"After watching oil companies suffer for awhile now, you would be foolish (IMO) to sell now when the market is rotating into value/cyclicals and winter is around the corner."
CRUDE OIL HAS DROPPED $1.96 SINCE 7:12 AM MONDAY. I suspect the Thirty year interest rate could feel the effect of risk off early Tuesday in premarket. Thoughts. $TMV $4882.T $RIOT $MARA $ETCG $AR $AM $REML $WY $ALEX
SRNE to spike soon. Don't be left out with huge pipeline of blockbuster candidates.
The price of this stock will be demand-driven. I'd check out the news regarding demand for natural gas throughout the world. Demand has increased significantly.
"Happily, just keeps chugging higher."
I am genuinely interested in buying shares into this company so I am not trying to seem like I'm down on this company. I want to ask if the 114% payout ratio is concerning?
"One Day, YES One Day. Folks will be waking up to see NG @ $6+ & OIL @ $80+and the $BSM $CDEV $AM $PAA $PSXP $ET ( HIGH DIVIDEND ENERGY STKS )UP BIG TIME from current levels. 30% upside in all of these within 2-3 months isHIGHLY LIKELY IMHO. Good Luck 2all !!"
Warm Autumn is forecast. Bearish for demand
"Heavy volume, were traders buying the dvy? Will it go down after eX? Whatever it went the right direction today"
