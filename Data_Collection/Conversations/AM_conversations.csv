"Nat Gas is trading @4 bucks, 5-28 it was 2.98. Does AM have any gas left that isn't hedged?"
"To get to a 10% yield, either the dividend is cut to 80 cents, or the share price rises to $12. If you've looked at the futures prices for nat gas and NGL's, demand will exceed supply, so the volumes processed by AM will not go down. Hence, the fees earned by AM will remain steady or rise. If that's the case, I see a 10% yield on a $12 share price, not the other way around."
"Serious Question - Would you guys reccomend this for a long term, 10+ years, hold? I'm looking to make some additions to my retirement portfolio and would like some nice long term holds with good dividends. Looks like a steady dividend payment, but the price over the 2 and 5 year has been dropping. Is this worth adding to my long term investments?"
"Six months from now, AM will be $17.00. No question."
"Life is good with AM. Paid $2.64, collected .3075 x4=1.23 46%, and shares are now $8.00 for 203% gain...still long. GLTA"
"The yield action with bonds will either:A) Normalize after a while and the whole market will stabilize. Meaning the bubble just let out some airB) The fed steps in (most likely, since Sleepy Joe, needs to sell bonds for his 1.9T stimulus, and Fed need to grease that up)My guess is after a week option a or b plays out and we are back to normal.The next bust is happening when interest rates go up. This isnt it."
"Market telling me I was wrong about the dividend day. Ok, mybad. But even when wrong- hey a little extra dividend helps. Bought a few shares yesterday with the dip. So all good for me. Hope there's a lesson for folks who get bad advice on message boards-- didn't set out to give bad advice.. but do your due diligence. It's your money."
is today ex dividend day?
"I think its worth picking up some shares at $9Michael Boyd:Appalachian natural gas production, absent an outright collapse in natural gas pricing, is assuredly heading higher.While the bull/bear case for E&Ps might be mixed on that outlook, pipelines assuredly benefit.Despite heavy exposure to gathering and processing assets and heavy reliance on Antero Resources, the firm has a great risk/reward profile."

Back once again to AM. Was I missed LOL. I treat AM as a preferred of AR and trade based on a ratio between the shares. Last trade was in the 1.3 and 1.4 ratios but AR has moved higher as most of you know. So today was a 1.6 ratio swap and dang the price has risen nicely since my entry. Do luv the sweet sweet dividend but I love sp appreciation even more.. Anyone care to share their strategy for this stock. Just own a few thousand shares these days of AM. Always fun and educational to share investment thoughts.
Gotta feel pretty good about today. Anyone feel different about AM?
Kinda mad. Only got to about 85% of goal before it popped. Not sure I will get another chance and won't chase it up. Oh well.
Looks to be fear of a dividend cut that may happen but not as deep as expected or it could be worse. This management is difficult to predict. This is the dividend they were going to grow just 6-9 months ago so who know. Maybe they increase it! Lol that would be hysterical to watch that short covering.
"What did I tell you all, we would be back over $6 in no time. That was exactly 5 days ago, and now we’re flirting with $7’s soon"
About time for this one to start to move up again.
"Is the dividend safe for 2020, what are your thoughts?"
W0W read hedge funds loaded up but this sharp sudden rise is a surprise
Was AM getting toppy at the mid Eights? Appears as much
"When I bought AM one month ago, it had a Zacks rating of 2 (buy). Now it has a rating of 4 (sell), what materially happened in that period that would cause such a drop ? If I had any confidence in Zacks then, I certainly don’t now."
"Up 20%+ today...........and you think the div announcement has not leaked to ""some"" parties ?"
Need your advice please if I buy today AM will I get the dividend
Hmmmmmm!
"This is a very strange, fishy situation. The ex dividend date is 8 days away and it pays 43%. Why would anybody sell it with the price rising?"
Solid Day! Can't remember a day when all my pipes and tanks were in the Green
"DENVER, April 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Antero Midstream Corporation (""Antero Midstream"") today announced that the Board of Directors of Antero Midstream declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per share for the first quarter of 2021. In addition, Antero Midstream announced plans to issue their first quarter 2021 earnings on Wednesday, April 28, 2021 after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange."
Good $AM article on SA just came out. I'll try replying to this post with a link and see if Yahoo lets me do it (it usually doesn't).
Got your dividend check yet? How important is a dividend to you?
"Anyone have an idea about how much DRIP money will now flow into the stock? Assuming 20% of the non AR held shares DRIP, I would guess about $20 million."

"This is NOT a stock to short imo. Imagine what kind of day this one will have, if they come out an affirm the dividend, as ET did?"
"I bought in back in April and loaded up big. I've got 8,280 shares at an average of $4.54. I got a fat divvy payment in Q1 and am about to get another one in Q2. I'm also up around 30% on the investment itself. Would LOVE to hear some guidance from those of you who have invested in this NG space for years and/or know a lot about AM and its competition and industry cycles to let me know how this could play out if I hold. Right now, assuming these $.3075 per share dividends don't go anywhere, I don't see how selling would be advisable now that I'm pulling in over $10k annually in dividends. Thanks in advance for the thoughts!"

"Hello everyone,At first glance, AM's ER is somewhat disappointing, but this is due to various special effects. In essence-One-off expense of 20.7 million from the debt restructuring from SN24 to SN29.-5.1 million negative tax effect.108.9 million, adjusted earnings were almost 7% higher than a year earlier.Operationally, there has been a significant improvementRevenue +11% / EBIDTA +12%Net debt to last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was reduced from 3.7x to 3.6x. The bottom line is not as weak as it looks at first glance."
"with hedges in place for the rest of this year and 50% for next year revenue should be OK. The good news is growing volume, reduced leverage, increased dividends and an improved balance sheet combined with super economies in the field reducing drilling and expenses should result in better returns to shareholders. I think the price action is way overdone making AM a good speculative buy. With an incredible yield you are now paid for the risk. Because computers do most of the trading and exaggerate market directions I will likely wait a week of so to see if the dust settles before adding to my position. As the coverage ration improves the dividend should become more secure. Management has the message, deleverage before the market does it for you."
Here comes $5. May see $6 at some point next week.

"NG price currently at 4.19 today plus 6.9%. The highest level since mid-January 2019! Unfortunately does not help the price of the AM share and the shares of all other companies related with gas at all. The fact that despite this price jump at NG today ALL fall, and have been performing significantly worse for almost two months, I can not explain with any known information. Only with ""games"" or information that the major market players have ahead of us."
Who thinks their dividend will be lowered?Their EPS is still too low to sustain the dividend.
Some days- up and some days down. In any event x date plus a sale of nearly all my remaining AM. Dividend harvesting along with my belief that AM has seen its high for 2021. Glta. Been wrong before but can't forgive management for the divi cut.

Strange share price development today.Has there been someone all the time at 10.90 collected / supported or repelled / capped?
so we think the spill isnt gonna gut this tommorow lol
"They announced the dividend, unchanged."
Dividend declared. All good.
BlackRock now owns more than 5 percent...received notice this morning.
Does anyone here believe AM will raise the dividend before next year? They have been saying next year but it seems there is some possibility for this year with all the FCF at AR and the desire to increase production at these gas prices.

"Nasdaq, AM Dividend History shows a consistant divi payout since 2015."
I'm wondering if anyone has opinion to share as to where opportunities currently lie with O/G sectors. Which is better looking forward (and upward):1. Drilling2. Equipment & services3. E&P4. Midstream5. TankersThank you
"No. We really haven't thought about changing the dividend. Obviously, we haven't increased it and we don't plan on increasing it. Like I mentioned, the return of capital is going to come in the form of buying back shares. So when you actually look at our model, we highlighted that the trend of the capital going much lower and then you have the EBITDA growth that kind of meres AR's growth plans, your coverage goes up to the 1.2 to the 1.3 range, so that's really not a profile that would lend itself to be reducing the dividend.You also kind of lookout in '21, '22, the cash flow plus the dividend payout -- cash flow, excuse me, less the dividend payout, less the capital is about at parity, you're almost free cash flow after dividend. So again, not a profile that would suggest that you would be needing to cut any of the dividends. So we don't see that in the future. We just plan on holding it flat and then returning capital through buying back shares. If it just stays down at these low prices, we'll just be opportunistic and get a lot of shares in."
"Today once again virtually the entire energy sector partly high price losses, with AM and AR in the lead.At AM, the expectation of the usually occurring price declines due to the dividend discount and subsequent consolidation probably play a role.At AR, however, this is irrelvant and yet there are also high losses here.In both cases, I consider today's share price loss to be completely exaggerated, as is the share price development since one month, which has clearly decoupled negatively from the gas price development. The long-term prospects for both companies have improved massively recently and justify higher share prices in my opinion.To assess the prospects for AM, it is first important to look at AR's situation:AR should profit very strongly from the gas price development in the long term. Of course, large parts of the current production are tied to a lower price. However, there should also be some additional production that can be traded at higher prices, which will at least improve earnings to a certain extent in the short term. Furthermore, I assume that AR will use the very positive development of the NG price to secure higher prices for later times. Since the prices are currently significantly above the calculation that AR has assumed for the CF development, the balance sheet ratios in 5 years should also be significantly better than forecast when the JV was launched.Briefly: Current increased production at modestly higher prices = slight improvement in earnings.In the long term, significantly higher fixed prices, better results, greater debt reduction.For AM, this means:In the short term, higher sales due to greater use of own services (transmission, water supply) by AR.Significantly better chances of success for investments in capacity increase, since both AR and the JV will obviously use the infrastructure intensively.In the long term, like AR, better results, greater debt reductionIn addition, a hedge against support measures in favor of AR, which have been a certain burden for AM in the past."

"Happily, just keeps chugging higher."
"Yesterday, up 3.2% from the low on high turnover. From a chart perspective, this looks like a price reversal.Price performance since high in the last 8 weeks -17% or -15.8% taking into account the dividend discount. NG price during this period +5.6%, although the high was reached later.Significant underperformance of the share compared to the NG price (-22.6%/ -21.4%), which is by the way even much higher for other companies (e.g. AR, SMLP, EQT).ER was not bad at all, taking into account the special effects, so it can hardly be the reason for this weak performance. Neither can future prospects, because these would then also be recognizable in the NG price.So my only explanation is that many of those who entered at low prices have recently ""cashed out"". Let's see when they get back in. In any case, I used yesterday to stock up."

What am I missing? Why would people sell when they have a %40+ dividend in the bag? I just picked up 2000 shares?
During the conference call management sad they expect higher dividend after the capex for AR new drilling project.
Is Antero Midstream a company or MLP?
52 week high!!
Why didnt I buy more :(
Why announce no shares buy back in Q3? The info seems out of place for a PR announcing the divvy....only thing I read out of that is they're trying to signal they have not forgotten or given up and shares buyback and may in fact be setting money aside to do that....coming up!
It seems to me that the company should come out with some comment as to why the two leaders and largest shareholders have sold such a substantial portion of their holdings.

"Seeking Alpha article of this morning- some good data but suspect conclusions. Notes AM is in growth mode but notes-- surprise- reliance on one major customer, doesn't own the jv but has 1.3 dividend coverage and debt that is lower than most midstreams.

Today's was written by somehing/someone called Power Hedge. Mho-- no new information and no supporting information- just a feeling picked out of the air."

"New presentation dated December 21, 2020 at the AM website. Nice fundamental answer to our new poster Arthur Axmann. Puts his claims in the bogus category so far as AM is concerned. Close to 700 millions in distributable cash to support the dividend in the coming year. No worries on paying that sweet sweet dividend but of course with the sp expected to rise the dividend yield will decline absent further share buybacks. Still 150 millions available on the share buyback authorization according to the last quarterly financials. Merry Ho hos and glta... 7 trading days left in 2020. Enjoy them."

"picking up some shares before the 25% of 17,6% distribution ....thank you !"
"Like most here I’m disappointed to see the dividend reduced by 27%. But as others have pointed out, its not because the business is trending in the wrong direction. In fact, its very much the opposite situation. The AR business is picking up and that’s forcing AM to increase Capex significantly. The long term result will be significantly lower debt and significantly higher FCF. At some point these moves will result in additional increases to AM’s credit rating. These moves should result in greater long term EV for AM. So where does the stock go from here ? When ET cut its distribution in half last October the stock dropped 15% and bottomed 10 days later. After 30 days it had recovered to pre announcement levels. 30 days later it was 15% higher. I would expect a similar pattern from AM except I suspect the drop will be a little less than 15% and the bounce above pre announcement levels will be more muted. I still feel the stock will hit $12 at some point this year which would give it a yield of 7.5%. That yield would be comparable to WES, DCP and slightly better than ET which has $72B of debt and a 5X debt load."
"Hello fellow investors,Is this dividend sustainable?After seeing BP cut their divy in half I am just questioning it.Thanks!"

Been buying every dip on this stock for weeks. Feeling pretty happy about that decision today.
"After watching oil companies suffer for awhile now, you would be foolish (IMO) to sell now when the market is rotating into value/cyclicals and winter is around the corner."
"Looking at the ""Holders"" tab, it's easy to see that very nearly 33% of common stock is held by insiders. That single fact generates some rather interesting questions, namely:That's quite a high percentage, isn't it ...? That said, those insiders must be reaping millions of dollars in dividends every quarter, right ...? Those two questions lead to the third - and most interesting - question, namely: What are you waiting for ...?"
"I listened to both AR and AM calls and looked through the deck. From the questions asked and the presentation material, its obvious they intend to keep their feet on the pedal. Full speed ahead, damn the NG prices. There were questions related to cutting back on production to balance the market and live within cash flow.Their response was the Firm transport commitments made on pipelines and contracts with 3rd parties means they have keep raising production otherwise they will be paying for pipeline capacity they dont use. There is also efficiency aspect, both capital efficiency and operational efficiency with growing production and scale. They have 2 years of good hedges so no worries on NG side. The liquids pricing will fluctuate with oil prices but with Mariner 2 pipe, they are getting improved setbacks and a huge shell plant coming on line in 3 years is going to be a great demand for all this NGL production. They see their DCF coverage improve to > 1.3x beyond 2020. I think its a little optimistic but > 1.2 should be doable. They have enough liquidity to make it through the 2021 maturity wall, it might result in higher interest on the rolled over bonds but its manageable. They are reducing their costs dramatically and there have been lots of quiet lay offs. They have also reduced the rig count over time. I think these guys can ride it out through to 2023-24 given their conservatism but if NG prices and NGL prices remain low for that long then they may have some difficulty. Either NG or NGL pricing has to recover somewhat and they are able to survive. AR just needs to survive (and not make any profit) for AM to be successful. CEO and CFO own many more shares of AM then AR so you know where they are aligned. Frankly this is overdone at 14% dividend. Usually 14% dividend implies near term trouble and/or dividend cut. Neither is in the cards, it will recover back to 10-11% or more in short order, but ALGOS and trade war fears may drag this down even more."
"AR/AM This is a company that the ""experts"" were totally wrong. AR has singular hedging capabilities that the market overlooked or dismissed. Have you noticed that oil is almost $50?"

"Well it's back to pre crash level, with a fantastic yeild.Energy stocks all dropped a little it seems.Volatile market fluctuation, is probably all it is, I went ahead and added more, as I am hopeful it will go up to $12 or higher, the div. 1.23 annually so 10% would be @ $12.30 per share. Very reasonable target in my estimations, and it's been at that level before. Debt. doesn't seem to be and issue, crude and gas prices both slowly increasing, no preferred shares, lots of insider ownership, looks solid to me."
I would expect it to gained back what it lost. Not sure why it slid. (iddenBa)Volatile can be a money maker. I've picked up a few more shares.
Anyone buying with the 10% yield?
"BTW, if they stay true to form, we should get dividend announcement on Wednesday. Maybe that will kickstart some movement on AM. Thoughts?"
"This stock is down about 40% YTD. clearly the market is screaming that this stock is risky. So what is that risk ? Debt is considered moderate by MLP standards and the current cash flow supports the distribution and is forecast to continue to support it through all of 20. So where is the risk ? Its counter-party risk with AR AMs ability to cover the distribution and repay its debt is contingent on AR continuing to drill wells and grow its volumes. To do that AR needs cash. The market is very concerned with the April bank redetermination for AR as well as a billion dollar bond coming due in 21. If AR gets its bank lines reduced in April it will have to cut back on drilling and that will shoot a hole in AMs distribution coverage. Another possibility is that in order to entice the AR lenders to maintain current credit lines AM is forced to once more reduce its rates to AR in order to increase FCF to AR. Again that would wreak havoc on AMs distribution coverage and force an immediate cut to the distribution. The present value of ARs reserves also took a hit given the year end 19 gas prices. That will also hurt come redetermination time in April. In order to repay the debt coming due in 21 AR likely needs to sell something. That is difficult in this market. But the 21 market for selling assets might look better. Only time will tell. Given the April redetermination risk, I don’t expect much out of this stock until that question is answered. There is currently no catalyst to move the stock up. Can it go lower. Sure. But I would not expect a lot of downside from here. So the current bet here is on AR holding its bank lines in April and executing its drilling plans. If that occurs this stock could double by the end of the year. But if those lines get cut there is likely a distribution cut coming for this one. Higher natural gas prices could moot this entire discussion but I just don’t see much upside to gas prices in 20. Any discussion of AM going “under” is nonsense. Worst case is probably a 50% reduction in the dividend which allows rapid debt reduction. That likelihood is pretty much already priced into the stock price - which is why I will continue to buy the dips on this one."

"Surprised it's not listed on this thread yet - sales were to satisfy tax liabilities from the conversion transaction last Spring. All other executives sold over $12.50 to raise cash to satisfy the obligation. They didn't want to sell, held out, and now have to sell at a lower price to satisfy tax bill coming due in a month or two. Very understandable reason for sales. Timing unfortunate."

"What should I do with AM? Hold, sell, buy. I only need true opinions please."
Someone needs to inform Arturo that he can quit ranting that the dividend is not sustainable because its 15%. Its only 13.5% now.
Thought Dividend will be paid today? Did I miss something?
AR up almost 18% while AM down 8%...can anyone explain the big difference in light of result? I am surprised that the good news for AR was somehow negative for AM.
AR is hedged through 2022.That means that AM will generate requisite revenues.12 dividend payments times 30 cents equals $3.60 in dividends.So you're paying 50 cents on the dollar for the company in three years time.Probably a decent risk-reward at present prices.
Nothing fundamentally has changed for this stock in the last 3 trading days other than the price.
"Although bought at various times, my average purchase price is about $6/share. However, being an avid but not overly strict follower of Benjamin Graham, I feel somewhat ""incentivized"" to sell all shares if/when share price attains $9/share (that is, a 50% gain in share price. However, the quarterly dividend remains rather attractive, blunting a bit Graham's advice. L/T vs. S/T capital gains are a negligible concern.So, should I sell at $9/share or continue to hold the shares for its dividend ? - Any thoughts ...?"
I am genuinely interested in buying shares into this company so I am not trying to seem like I'm down on this company. I want to ask if the 114% payout ratio is concerning?
Massively undervalued.
Nice up day for NG. AM will trend back up.
Bot more AH. Can't go wrong given $150 mil left for buy backs and holding dividend steady !
"The ex-dividend date for AM is set one business day (10/28) before the record date. If you purchase AM on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date (10/27 or before), you get the dividend."
It appears that the situation of AR and AM is brightening. This pair is very well run with smart management that has shown that top talent can navigate companies through tough times. I was initially negative about the dividend cut but I'm willing to stay around due to the savings will be used intelligently to strengthen AM for the longer term. The market seems to be confirming this sentiment as AM has crossed $9 today. So I expect tosee a good total return going forward. I expect the equity to outperform the loss in dividend cash if management uses the savings to improve shareholder value.
AM CEO did not sell his shares. He gifted them to charity. Read footnotes on SEC Form 4.
JP Morgan Chief equity analyst is bullish on energy going forward! He has been more right than not over the last few years!
"Well, I have started to buy into AM today and will continue to buy if it falls more. Great dividends and stock will move up in coming months. Specially before next dividends to be paid in April 2020."
"I was initially upset at the dividend cut but I chose to stay on board with my position. The market's judgment is clearly in favor of management. With a remainder 10% dividend the cut will strengthen the company and the dividend ""loss"" is being returned in the form of capital appreciation. It's not always true that a dividend cutis a SP disaster. Kudos to the executives!"
I am thinking good news after market close they way the SP is headed. But could be wrong have been before.

Does anyone know if the dividend on this stock was reduced?

"Considering the size of AR hedgebook, nat gas. prices should not play a role .... so mild winter ... Who cares by extension AM which does business with AR should be fine."
Hmmm. Gonna be back over $6 real soon I’d say
"Looks like Glen (10 million) and Paul (18 million) sold shares. I'm guessing that they sold them back to the company as they were at a discount. They still own a lot but, looks like about 2/3rds of their holdings. Will probably hear more in the AM."
"Wow, this breached 10 bucks ... Im shocked."
We may get to 7.50 by div date......Still a month away........plenty of time.
The price of this stock will be demand-driven. I'd check out the news regarding demand for natural gas throughout the world. Demand has increased significantly.
$10 stock
New presentation at AM website. Very positive-- showing nice growth ahead and fiscal restraint. All the qualities for higher sp.
Hum........that sweet smell of frying shorts in the morning............
"OK, so the dividend was reduced. Am obviously not pleased with that. However, in reading thru their recent filings and announcements, I am finding it troublesome that AM seems to be ""speaking out of both sides of its mouth"". - BTW, your thoughts and opinions are welcome. Here goes ...1. AM has stated (in the Exhibit 99.1 attached to its 8-K report to the SEC, file 17 FEB 2021) that they are ""reallocating a portion of the dividend payment"" to fund infrastructure projects. They further state therein that: ""This reallocation is expected to allow Antero Midstream to internally fund these attractive rate of return projects without adding leverage or total debt.""2. As recently as 10 NOV 2020 another 8-K was filed with SEC in which AM announced the ""creation of a direct financial obligation"" for $550M in an apparent ""private placement"" (i.e. 7.875% Notes not available to the security-buying public). So, this debt was created very recently.It seems to me that despite AM's most recent assertion that they didn't want to add to their total debt, they were perfectly willing to do precisely that in Nov 2020. Why couldn't the funds from November's debt offering be used to support the just announced ""infrastructure projects""?Anyone else find this troublesome? - Thanks for your thoughts."
Last year dividend announcement on Jan 16. This year? And will we see a 19th consecutive increase.?
AM decent Q. Some issues remain but results overall were pretty impressive. Another adjustment in Capex in 2H20 will have positive cash flow impact. This management team looks on top of things. Investors should reward them with a higher SP
The market is pricing AM at this level because they think the dividend is not sustainable. The market thinks the AM business model is broken. Energy never goes out of fashion.
"Will AM fare any better than other energy companies under the new Anti energy administration. I sold ET at a loss two months ago, doubled my position of AM. I have a bad feeling for ET, but not very secure with AM and the new Administration. We still have to heat homes and generate power"

"Today is a perfect day why I don't use stops on a stock that I believe in. I'm sure many people got ""stopped"" out on this morning's volatile activity."
"I had a look back at their 10-Q form filed on 4-29-2020. - Their current ratio is now about 1.8, meaning they can more easily meet their debt obligations. Their previous filing ( for the year 2019 ) indicated that the current ratio at that time was about 045; not very encouraging. So, their most recent C.R. is a good sign."
Any educated stock price predictions for this year and next? Serious replies please
"I’ve been buying since 2.50. If you believe we’ll be using NG for the next 15-20 years this is a tremendous opportunity to set up a 25% yield for retirement. I have 58,000 shares avg $2.00 yield 59%. Still at $5 im adding prob 22k more to 80,000 which will pay $98,400 income/yr without raising the dividend. $226k total cost yields 43.5%. I can retire on this."
Charles...sold a few puts this morning offsetting calls. we will see how this works. but for now my bank account is happy
"Basicaly a buyback makes sense here, it means managment does not have to spend on dividends"
What is your thoughts on AM this week?
"After a nice run up in the recent past,is it time to take some profits? Opinions?Is AR an early indicator?"
This has been very good to be But. am wondering if I should have bought the other Antero. shoulda coulda woulda

Marathon Petroleum sells Speedway gas station network to 7-Eleven parent company for $21 billion.
"Not too many people taking advantage of this bargain prce today. That will probably happen tomorrow- last day before ex-dividend, and along with slightly improving NG prices, along with higher AR, MR, RRC,, and the other NG companies..."
0.23 per share and lots of liquidity. No worries.
So who is planning to reinvest the dividend? No drip program but you can still compound that 10% dividend.
"I just had an unsettling thought. AM will probably make their divvy announcement tonight. They've maintained an almost absurd yield mainly because $AR needed the income. With AR's improved cash flow due to much higher NGL prices, I wonder if we might see a divvy cut by AM?"
Is it me or do you think its odd the stock trades lower before the ex div tomorrow?
shorts will have to pay dividend. Nice return on investment for longs.
Shorts squeeze will be EPIC. Even bigger than $ATER $AM or $GME.
What happened with earnings?
AM has had a good run but is falling behind AR by quite a bit. I suppose the dvy reduction took it's toll

"If the price happened to plummet, surely the dividend would remain the same and or increase right?? I have 200 shares of this entity and am praying that the investment doesn’t betray me. If anyone’s got some reassuring words or anything like that, I’d appreciate it"
Guys please help with some info. Want to buy $AM because of its 11.25% divs . Will $AR impact on $AM with its positive news? Just don’t want to miss current div percentage if it gets raised. Waiting to buy lower
"i am new to the board and was wondering if AM or AR is a better investmentthanks, Marc"
Fine results. Don't be confused by the impairment; something to be expected by experts. The dividend is secure. The stock should go up a lot the coming weeks.
Awesome. Dividend kept same. Bough back 3.2 mil shares. Has capacity to buy $150 Mil worth of stock !
getting ready to double up and collect a lot more dividends
"No div. cut. The Board of Directors of Antero Midstream declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per share for the third quarter of 2021, or $0.90 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend will be payable on November 10, 2021 to stockholders of record as of October 27, 2021."
AM announces $300M buyback program. Says it will not impact its financial profile.
Well so much for debt reduction. Announcement this morning of intent to place 650 millions in new senior notes. Stated objective to roll the 2024s and pay down bank line. So what is happening to the fcf?
Gotta love a day like this. Just made a nice paper 30k since yesterday's close. And now the dividend.
What will be ER report?? Loss or beat
"Must confess. Yep Fidelity got me as a pattern day trader and won't allow me to purchase AM-- says too risky. Moving my accounts to another broker. Can't get an answer as to why AM is so risky given the Moody's upgrade and strong free cash flow guidance. While this debate with Fidelity is going on, AM sp keeps rising....mmmm... not happy with Fidelity."
"Okay a question? AR said it will reduce its rig count from 4 to 1 in the second quarter, so am I correct in assuming there will be less volume going through AM in the second quarter? Meaning a lesser payout? Did I miss anything?"
"michelle, KT and other $AM $AR holders, hedge with $NRGD. After all big oil reached its peak June 25. $NRGD -3X leveraged ETNs up from $10.52 to $15.15 this premarket since then +44% in a month and two days."
I just loaded at 6.50
Is the dividend safer than a lot of other pipelines ?
"Imo, AM in some ways is similar to ET. Both make $, can cover their distributions, and did NOT cut their dividend. ET still has a 21% divvy, but with AM sporting around 36%, this is the better BUY right NOW!"
Panic in the AM! Buy on the discounted price!
Recovering from the dividend adjustment. Nice to see the nearly complete snapback
Nice mention in Barron's
Wonder what would happen if we got some real volume on days like this. 3x+ daily average and this thing will move fast
When does new dividend start?
"Is this dividend safe? Looking to get into AM (although I missed the latest dividend, oh well). Thanks!"
"Quarterly Dividend Announcement, remains the same $0.3075, payable 2/11/2021The ex-dividend date for AM is set one business day (2/2/2021) before the record date (2/3/2021. If you purchase AM on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you own or purchase shares before the ex-dividend date (2/1/2021 or before), you get the dividend."
is the dividend paid in cash?
They just need to reinforce their commitment to the div. or better remind investors how they planned to grow it before things fell apart.
Am I reading correctly that the dividend is dropping to $.90?
I’m looking to enter AM this week. What do you all think would be a good price to wait for? Long term for me. Thank you.
GS downgrades AM to sell with a $7.50 price target. I disagree with their assessment. Time will tell who is correct.
Third quarter dividend announced. Unchanged. Disappointed ... Naaa. I take 20% div any time !
"last day before the Ex-Dividend, get in before the end of the day to be eligible for dividend payment"
Don't pinch me!! I don't want to wake up
"Thank you, AM, again for letting me make as much in a few days as the dividend would be worth in a year. Buy in fear, sell in strength."
Got an underweight at Morgan Stanley but price target raised to 9. Beats GS's sell and 7.50 target. Have to see which if either of the big dogs is more right?
"3 biggest $ETC-USD transactions in Oct were buys. Things are looking up for Ethereum Classic to close the gap up to $ETH-USD. $NRGU, $RIOT, $REML. $AR, $AM, $FLNG, $TMV, $SLVO"

Antero Midstream Cut to Hold From Buy by JonesTrading. I couldn't find the reasoning for their decision. I never heard of Jones Trading before.
"We been having a pretty productive discussion last couple of days-- regarding the dividend cut and abandonment of supply constraints. It has been my position-- in addition to taking it in the shorts on income and on a small position of my holdings (did buy a few shares at 9.42 and more in the low 9s) that management has been erratic in terms of following through with written protocols-- a la supporting the dividend and maintaining supply restraints. So let me ask you, how important is it to you that you can trust what a management says is it policies and goals?For the record- and as a value investor-- let me refer to one of the great value investors-- Warren Buffet. Mr. Buffet says year after year he will only invest in companies that he has trust in the management. Right or wrong?"
Sold $10 PUTS @$1.50
I don’t know why one would sell here.Dividend is secure Parent AR is strengthening balance sheet and a huge hedge bookParent needs this dividend Dividend is 20% which is awesome when banks are paying zeroAdded more today and will add more tomorrow tooGl!
