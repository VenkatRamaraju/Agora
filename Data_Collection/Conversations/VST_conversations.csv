"Battery problems at Moss Landing. Doesn't it seem as if there are many technical problems with batteries? As a country we are rushing into renewable energy without having the essential storage issue resolved. Wouldn't it be wise not to announce hard dates for renewable energy, perhaps slow up a bit to spend more time developing battery technology, and use our cheap, abundant, reasonably clean, and relievable natural gas in the meantime? There now have been instances of Tesla's catching on fire, burning the garage down, and then burning the house down. It is now recommended to park Teslas outside, I mean, seriously????"
"Vistra is now offering a lottery where by an employee can win $25,000 to $50,000 by getting a vaccination. There will be a total of 8 winners. I am in favor of vaccination but doesn't a prize of 50 grand seem just a tad excessive? This is carrot to extreme when the stick would work so much better, say, an added 200 bucks per month for health insurance. Another example of our CEO aspiring to sainthood."
"Nice bounce today, I feel very comfortable owning this stock at this price. Bought the majority of my stock at 16.70, average price of 17.1. With all of management and board members purchasing stock, this is a very reasonable entry price. This is currently my core holding with 40% of my investment. I will look to sell long dated calls in the next 2-3 months."

"10/13 Pre Market:VST announced sale of preferred stocks worth 1 billion USD to institution and select private investors at 8%. The sale is expected to close out on 10/15/2021.With the cumulative preferred stocks, if there are any missed dividend payout (i.e. because VST had to instead pay down the debts), the preferred share holder will receive the MISSED + CURRENT dividend payment after VST comes out of the fiscal mess. The common shareholders (i.e. me) will not receive the MISSED dividend payment and will have to wait in line to receive the current dividend after the preferred shareholders are reimbursed.With the proceeds of the $1 billion, VST will start buying back the outstanding common shares starting Nov 1 2021.Personally, I don't buy this line. I believe VST will use the proceeds of the sale to pay down the debt, and simultaneously dilute the share holder's value. With USA fiscal stimulus coming to an end in NOVEMBER (same time as VST buyback), the 10 year bond rate will continue to increase to about 1.8 to 2.2%. This will start to eat into the VST common share price, as bonds will start to appear more attractive compared a debt laden utility company."
"The latest press release deals with ""free electricity with energy cash rewards"" is still another release which says nothing about operations, improving profits, massive natural gas prices, potential cold temperature period in coming winter, etc. It doesn't even say if the ""free electricity"" gambit will result in less churn. It just never ends."
"Vistra might consider honoring their vertically challenged CEO by offering a ""free electricity for midgets, dwarves, and pygmies with energy cash rewards"" program to corner the little people market."
"It was proposed to shift $250,000,000 from border security to shoring up the power grid, but the proposal was shot down. Vistra should have insisted on grid improvements as part of their negotiation with ERCOT. I don't think Vistra got paid a dime for adding gas storage to generating plants. Also, if there is a cold snap, Vistra should put their customers first and not agree to try to cover shortcomings for those who had signed up for other electricity suppliers. Of course, Vistra may not be in a competitive position to take hard lines."
"8/19 - Morgan Stanley adjusts price target to $25 from $27, maintains overweight."
80 million in new pfd div to come out of cash flow. 6/30/21 book value of 12.60ps and tangible book value of 2.50ps. The buy back will reduce the book values further. The 2 billion buy back would be better spent to close coal power plants and replace with greener fuels and make other investments to grow future profits. I sold today since I do not like their strategy. Of course the investment bankers love it since they get big fees. I am old enough to remember when buybacks were illegal!!
"My expectation is that because of the new customer addition, this will result in double digit growth % in its revenues. Moreover, with the expected inflation, VST will increase its electricity bills accordingly. This will also boost up revenues significantly. I see people with the concern what if VST faces another weather event like this and incur another huge loss. I think by that time, VST will prevent itself from the unforeseen event by implementing new procedures -- the world is not stationary and work in 1-dimensional. I also have seen more population allocating from other states to Texas in the US. The world is also demanding EVs. The more EVs on the street, this demand could push the electricity price even higher up. I see a very nice recovery from this company and a bright future in this sector in general. Long VST~"
"VST's cash flow and by having financing debt, it is able to absorb the 1.3B one time fee without any issue. My understanding is that because of the BK of Texas energy producers, VST will take over a significant number of NEW CUSTOMERS from the market, dominating the market share, and FREE growth opportunity given with this weather event. Its share price could fluctuate for short term but it will gradually go back to where it was, and the NEW CUSTOMERS will add monstrous additional free cash flow in the future financial performance. It is now time to accumulate."
"RVING, Texas, April 23, 2021 -- Vistra (NYSE: VST) will host an investor call on Monday, April 26, 2021, to provide updated 2021 guidance, including an update on the financial impact of Winter Storm Uri, and to discuss near-term capital allocation plans. Management will present the materials during a live conference call and webcast beginning at 8 a.m. EDT (7 a.m. CDT).￼""Vistra recognizes that the effect of Uri on our company is the most important near-term uncertainty for the financial markets and is presenting a significant overhang on our equity. As soon as we received and processed the likely final substantive information driving the financial impacts of the storm from ERCOT, we decided to hold an investor call to provide an update. We wanted to share this information as soon as we had a final estimate so that we can begin to rebuild from the very strong core of our company, continue our transformation, and get back on track to reaching our full value,"" said Curt Morgan, chief executive officer of Vistra."

"VST is certainly acting poorly. I miscalculated the competitive position of the stock. The company was given nothing or any way to account for the massive loss last winter. This loss was completely due to the strange arrangement with ERCOT. Presently, VST has the exact same situation facing them this winter. I thought VST was in a position to demand significant rate increases, but that is not the case. So, as has been stated, the stock is going nowhere. Compare the performance with the S & P 500 in the past year, and that shows the dramatic under performance."
"Don't make the mistake of thinking VST is a Texas ONLY company. The company retails electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across 20 states in the United States and the District of Columbia. It is also involved in the electricity generation, wholesale energy sales and purchases"
"Dang, a utility pops more then 10% in a day. Yeehaw!"
"""...superseding its prior $1.5 billion repurchase program, which had approximately $1.325 billion of remaining authorization""It's almost like we've heard this before... However, you can buy a lot of scholarships for homeless kids with a billion dollars of new cash."
I don't understand what they are doing. They are issuing 8% preferred and using the proceeds to repurchase common which yields less than 4%. Also the yield on the preferred is very likely to increase after 5 years. How does this increase earnings?
10/21 - Morgan Stanley adjusts price target to $31 from $29.
"Putting VST in perspective:1. VST is launched a $1.5Bn share repurchase program that began this year (they previously had suspended it to be prudent in regards to COVID and to focus FCF on paying down debt).2. VST (at the current share price of $20.99 and a 2021 FCFbG of $2,165BN) yields a 20%+ FCF yield which is not expected to decrease in the foreseeable future. If their investment/project minimum hurdle rate is in the mid-teens (e.g., 16%), it makes sense for them to view a share repurchase like an investment/project up to $27.57. Given the level of certainty of a share repurchase, one could argue that the minimum hurdle rate would be lower but let's leave it at $27.57 for a second to be conservative.3. For further validation why that share repurchase level is realistic, back in 2019 when the company was less profitable, ladened with more coal plants, had more leverage, faced higher interest rates, had lower credit ratings, and less growth prospects, the company executed significant share purchases averaging $25/share (NOTE: This is the average, not the maximum).4. Additionally, the ratings agencies are all indicating an IG rating this year with multiple up-ratings last year to one notch below IG and statements indicating to expect the IG rating in the second half of 2021. What does that mean? It means: a. lower costs of capital, b. attraction by institutional investors who are chartered/limited to institutional investments, c. Improved approval/bid rates from regulatory agencies on both the local, state and federal levels, and d. better terms with partners who price in accordance with counterparty risk.5. If that's not enough, don't forget that these guys have topped their forecasts since going public and what makes them different and able to do so in their competitive markets (e.g., ERCOT) is their focus on ""integrated/vertical"" development which improves their margins and reduces volatility of their earnings streams. 6. They have hit their leverage target in Q4 of 2020 and that leverage ratio will continue to decrease as their top line adjusted EBITDA numbers continue to rise.7. They just increased their dividend payouts for 2021 which will take effect in 2021 with an eye toward increasing it further in 2022. 8. They now have the largest Energy Storage System in the world with dozens of other Energy Storage systems across the Texas, California and permitting in other states beyond those two. Among the utility players in the world, they are the leader in ESS and their footprint is getting larger (with even hints of some international plays as well.....you can do your own research to find out about that).9. They have a pipeline of ESS/Solar deals already confirmed for this year and next which will soon replace all their coal plant generation and are set on contracts/agreements with attractive terms.10. Don't believe me? Well talk to the guys who get paid to do this for a living: Morgan Stanley, UBS, BMO Capital and Credit Suise all have Price Targets over $30 ranging from $31 - $34 per share. Already, the stock, as predicted with the share repurchase program just starting, is seeing a run-up and that run-up is only beginning.I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock run-up well past $25 per share and have a floor value of $27.5 in the next six months, and once the IG rating goes through, don't be surprised to see it push past $30 per share.VST is a solid bet that weathered/thrived during the Coronavirus and will continue to do so as it has done every quarter since going public.Enjoy the ride and Happy Investing!"
"FWIW, Vistra passes the screen for high 3-5 year appreciation potential, according to ValueLine (where I start due diligence, not that they are infallible). They use algorithms, of course, but as overseen by a human analyst. They project a target price range of $35-$85 for that 3-5 year period, but they are less sanguine about the coming 18 months, projecting a price of $7-$26, with a grim midpoint of $16. I know little about the Texas energy sector, to be honest, but my position is modest, and I am holding. I appreciate the thoughtful and helpful comments here, bull and bear and in between."

"Special Session in Texas scheduled by Abbott for July 8th; Lt Governor Dan Patrick specifically said he will seek special session to also pass, as additional reform and remedy for Uri's fall out, a refund/credit to the market for the 32 hours when $9k prices continued even after the outage, after which the prices should have returned to more normal levels far below $9k. This rebate was in the final version of HB4492 but got struck at the last minute; Lt. Governor was visibly upset about it. Expect it to be addressed in the Special Session. If so, Vistra will benefit hugely, and Vistra shares can be expected goes above $26 per share over the next 12 months (not including additional gains from the dividends). Disclaimers: I am long Vistra; do your own homework and independent analysis before dealing in shares of Vistra."
"Discussions by management and this board center on cash flow, stock buybacks. etc. but earnings are important as well. The 1st quarter of 2020 stated earnings of $0.11 cents a share, hurt by an explosion of selling and administrative costs and impairment of assets. I am expecting earnings of $2.00 a share in 2021, and with 1st quarter earnings of $0.50, after any impairment."

Shorts are trapped. HODL
What are your thoughts on another utility company AEP? It has significant operations in Texas.
"From the Q3 Transcript, ""Looking ahead to 2022, our current expectations for the earnings power of our business are consistent with our average 2020 to 2021 view, in the range of $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and a conversion rate to free cash flow before growth of 65% or more. We believe we can manage our year-to-year earnings volatility within a very tight range and we continue to have confidence in the long-term earnings profile of our business. The market clearly does not share this view. As action on climate change accelerates and private institutions and state and federal policymakers advance policies supporting the development of incremental renewable resources, investors are clearly questioning what this evolving landscape might mean for Vistra. In our view, it is this question that has directly been impacting Vistra's valuation. There is no justification for Vistra to trade at a 20% free cash flow yield based on the performance and financial position of the company.Free cash flow yields at these levels are generally reserved for companies in financial distress with poor performance track records and weak balance sheets. None of this applies to Vistra. The only explanation that seems to make some sense is that the market must expect Vistra will experience future economic distress based on the changing power generation landscape. In our view, Vistra's near-term financial performance supports a free cash flow yield at least in the low double digits, especially when taking into account where the Company's debt trades and the prospects for investment grade credit ratings in the next year. The debt-to-equity risk premium is confounding, rather if you believe in appropriate free cash flow yield for a business with a strong balance sheet and a proven track record on execution should be in the range of 10% to 12%. The recent prices where Vistra's stock has been trading would suggest that the market is assigning virtually zero equity value to Vistra's generation segment. In our view, this is a completely flawed assumption that is likely driven by the emotions of the current ESG environment as opposed to a practical and informed fundamental analysis."""
Can't wait for Wilder's comments on this new release.
Buying back 25% of ur market cap gets you up 7% premarket. Ex-Divy is 15th payable on 30th. Estimated earnings of 1.30 in 3 weeks. Sounds fun.
Seems like the share repurchase should finally take VST back over $20.
