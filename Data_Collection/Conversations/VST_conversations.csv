"Has anyone quantified the value of getting investment grade status? As this is an upcoming minestone in 2021, I'm curious the value. My novice attempt at calculating this, I see long term debt is $10B with a net interest expense of $800M. If they get the investment grade designation, assuming they reissue IG bonds, I'm calculating net interest dropping to $450M going straight to the bottom line (assuming a 4.5% bond). Does anyone more knowledgeable know if this is accurate?"
Insane quarter given the backdrop. This is one of the most irrational markets I’ve seen in my relatively short experience investing. I guess generating gushers of cash and eliminating chunks of debt that immediately cuts 5-8% annualized interest payments while reducing risk just doesn’t appeal to the somewhat dull investing public. Instead they’d rather be chasing Boeing as it takes on $25 billion in debt and stops making planes for the next 3-5 years.
"From Reuters article labeled ""Texas power crisis could cripple small marketers, unravel market deregulation"" ""Nearly a quarter of the 100 Texas power companies receiving the high power and services bills could end up transferring all their customers to rivals. Consolidation could leave more than 80% of deregulated Texas retail customers with giants Vistra Corp and NRG Energy, consumer advocates and industry executives said. Both have been buying up rivals in recent years.""""Texas has called on the state’s largest utilities, including Vistra Corp’s TXU, to accept customers from other providers. TXU told the state it would accept more than 1.3 million new customers."""
"ValueLine can be good, but neglected to mention Vistra's CEO is a midget, or little person if you will."
"I own the stock and even some options now... and I still hope it keeps going down for a bit because this is great to be able to buy into a utility at this PE and yield! If everyone is locked down and not buying much stuff, there is one thing I know they are still buying.PLEASE.... you sell it and I'll buy it! :)"
The general opinion is that VST is priced at a discount. I suggest ceasing stock buybacks now. One reason is electrification of the US will require more generating power and VST will need the money for capital investment. Another reason is that would allow a significant increase in the dividend. A doubling or tripling of the dividend would cause an upward shift in the stock price.
Vistra was not the only one who had problems. It may happen that some suppliers go bankrupt and their customers may switch to Vistra. This could potentially increase profits in the coming years.

"Yup, below 16 just like I predicted and was lambasted on this board for saying it. Stock has no reason to go up. Management will eventually run the company into the ground."
"Texas house just passed an ERCOT bailout with similar legislation in the Texas senate. An approximately $2.5 billion plan to bail out Texas’ distressed electricity market from the financial crisis caused by Winter Storm Uri in February was approved by the Texas House Thursday. State Rep. Chris Paddie, R-Marshall, the bill’s author, said a second bailout bill will be necessary during the current legislative session for severely distressed electric cooperatives."
"How many billions of shareholder dollars will VST lose this time around? Since the last Vistra market failure, they have added many new customers with no accompanying additions to their capacity."
"S&P wants debt/EBITDA in the “2.5x-2.75x on a sustained basis”. VST is at 2.5 so if they move from 2.5 to 2.75 debt to EBITDA, that gives them $950M of room on the debt. How much do they need to pay down immediately is the question. If the event is $1.3B, that’s $350M they need to pay down immediately (2.1 months of FCF), then going forward it’s buried in the debt. If its $900M, its buried in its debt immediately. I’m sure they will prioritize an accelerated debt paydown but not eliminate other activity (share repurchase, M&A). It’s zero return on the debt, though at least it can be spread over a few years. I’m still perplexed how they managed to lose money while prices were 9k per MWh for a week while generating (per my calculations) 12-14 MW, were locked in on NG contracts going in, etc. Their retail book not getting any blackouts must have been cranking the electricity throughout the event. I can’t believe some retail that was short going into this event came out long with all the concentrated blackouts. How does that happen ERCOT? What a failure."
Avenue Capital Hedge Fund heavy into VST these guys are deep value investors with 13 billion under management they have vested interest to support share price which is easy because of low volume or altogether acquire it now that current share price is same as book value .Energy corp it's only competitor in Texas trades at 2x book value so patience will pay.

"Don't make the mistake of thinking VST is a Texas ONLY company. The company retails electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across 20 states in the United States and the District of Columbia. It is also involved in the electricity generation, wholesale energy sales and purchases"
1/4 of my retirement gone today. They were doing so good lately.!!!!! Should I get out now or wait until recuperate some of my money?
"Articled Titled, ""Texas electric grid: ERCOT unveils 60-point reliability plan; PUC to work toward 'full overhaul' of market"" shows PUC direction and is worth the read. Some excerpts: The PUC's plan is expected to result in participants paying more for stability. Lake said the PUC's redesign process will wrap up by late 2021 following commissioners' shift into a decision-making ""design mode"" this fall.Changes outlined in that strategy could be made through ""relatively quick"" adjustments alongside more medium- and long-term processes related to system structure, incentives and other reliability updates, Lake said."

Switching out of long position in ATT (T) and adding to a long position in Vistra (VST). Bank of America has a buy rating and $20 price target for 2021.Plus a nice dividend in a company that will be here for the long term. Could see this stock hitting 25 over next 9 months.Vistra likely lost far less money than they noted a couple weeks ago. Regulators in Texas are pointing fingers at them right now so TXU/Vistra has reason to downplay each and every upside resulting from Uri.But do your own research and independently confirm everything i said...
Been in this stock for almost 2 years might be the most frustrating stock I’ve ever held. Nothing but good news but just can’t gain traction to the upside.
"VST, reported a loss as expected. But I see some nice improvements, adding to the bottom line. First, operating expenses for the quarter were down 371 million, 2.1% from 2021st quarter figure of three and 79 million.In first quarter 2021, the company's residential customer numbers dropped to 2.3% from prior quarter level. But, retail electric volumes in first quarter rose 21.9%. The volume is increasing, this is nice traction. Most of the info has been priced into the stock so far.Everyone knows that these guys need to diversify out of Texas or figure a way to mitigate their climate-based risk. I think something is coming down the pipe on this thing, and I'm going forward. Hoping for better news. By the end of the month!"

"Bought this about 2 months ago thinking the selling was overdone. Are there any long term holders here with thoughts on what 4492 passage would do for the share price? Has the bang already been priced in? When I bought, I was thinking that 20 might be a reasonable price."
"Scare stories thrown in on top of one rare, adverse event! The things the scare stories promote worry over would be detrimental to the entire system! Their speculation is all negative. Yes, changes need to be made and will be made, but ""the powers that be"" will not allow this one event to crush them. Natural gas suppliers WILL be held accountable, to some extent, due to contractual obligations . IMO, all involved will ultimately share in the costs associated with Uri's impact. I'M NOT GONNA SIT AROUND AND BIT MY NAILS OVER SOMETHING THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN! Increased my holding 25% Fri and if it drops to 16.50 Mon I will add another 25%.

Why the Drop?
Please put your seat belts on we're looking at a nice surge coming up here! BUY!!!
"Bloomberg Opinion article titled ""Texas May Have Finished Off One Energy Sector for Good"" is worth a look suggesting NRG and VST are both candidates for PE to take private. I don't think any PE will touch these things until the dust settles with PUC and ERCOT."
"I see few negative sentiments on VST here and elsewhere. Lot of it is attributed to:1. 2018 announcement of share buyback of 1.25b USD2. Recent drop in share price as a result of Uri;3. Decommission of 7500 mw of generation;4. The CEO's color commentary in the 4rt quarter's investor's meeting was hilarious (in my opinion). The CFO remained calm. VST takes up about 20% of my portfolio after RYCEF. I understand lot of folks lost $$, and I do not want to be in that boat either. Look up RYCEF's recent downturn as an example.1. To date they VST has purchased 0.125b USD in share buyback. VST could had purchased shares, but reality hit: Covid 19, and now URI. I commend the management in being fiscally restraint until the manufacturing economy (not the tech companies) recovers. Buy back would had placed VST in a worse financial position.2. VST is decommissioning 7500 mw of generation from 2025 though 2027, not 2021. The decommissioning are the coal sourced generators. Coal emission is the primary source of global warming. This is the prime reason Texas is in the mess to begin with. I get it some don't American's do not believe in global warming. That level of incompetence is on YOU. I am glad the management believes in it, and are taking measures to reduce it.3. You know what is an alternative fuel source to Coal? NATURAL GAS within Texas shale formation! a. Texas has surplus natural gas to build out three, $15 billion LNG liquefaction terminal. Does anyone know how much energy is spent in the liquefaction process, ship it to China, then re-gas it before it is burnt? b. Texas is flaring natural gas.c. Texas is sending LNG via ships to China and other overseas market. d. Texas is sending natural gas via pipeline to Mexico.Build out of additional combined cycle gas turbine power plants, which are more efficient than the coal plants. All Texas legislation needs to do is REDUCE shipping out of natural gas, assist in stabilizing the price, and use it for Texas!"
"Vistra just upsized its credit facility. I believe theyre doing this to possibly buy some defaulting REPs. Perhaps they will buy Just Energy:Apparently Vistra believes that, even without the upsized facility, ""it would have had sufficient liquidity to conduct its operations in the ordinary course of business."" However, ""in light of the short-term financial impacts of Winter Storm Uri, the Company believes it was prudent to enter into the [upsized facility] in order to provide an additional liquidity cushion to better position itself to, among other things, take advantage of potential opportunities to continue to grow and strengthen the Company’s business and address any unforeseen liquidity events.""Sounds like Vistra believes it may soon get a discount deal on a good book!"
"S&P up, Dow up, NASDAQ up, Vistra down again. This story’s getting old. What’s this tell us about the direction management is taking this thing? Or do they even know? Hopefully, they’ll do what they should have done in the first place and start buying back some shares. It makes no sense to keep letting this drop unless there’s a hidden grand plan? Sell out? Merger? privatization? This strategy doesn’t make any sense."
"I've owned this stock since it was on the post-bankruptcy pink sheets, and Sept 29 is the day I either step it up and buy even bigger or dump everything and move on. The company is a veritable cash ATM yet they always find a way to spend their billions of FCF on things other than returning capital to shareholders, just like the pipelines starting new projects at returns less than their cost of capital just to have ""growth"".I understand they needed to pay down and refinance debt, and they made some opportunistic acquisitions along the way. Now that they are at their target leverage and electric growth is stagnant, I hope they don't ""embark on a new multi-year, growth plan that meets the needs of all constituents, not just shareholders."" The anti-stockholder pledge that they signed made last year should frighten current owners.If they say something like ""we will increase our measly dividend by 20% annually and our excess capital will used to meet the needs of disadvantaged communities by installing microgrids and offering new financing plans for those who cannot pay"", I'm out. This isn't a charity.What I'd like to see that they can easily afford is a doubling or tripling of the dividend and/or buying back 10-15% of the stock annually. My fantasy: another going private transaction, because their stint in the public markets has been a wasted effort."
4 insiders just bought $1.4m worth of stock after close yesterday @ $17.24. Seems like they know the bill is going to get waived?
"For anyone interested in the text of the Texas Senate bill they passed, making PUC to make ERCOT reprice for Thursday and Friday, here is it: https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/SB02142I.htmNo mention of fixing the pricing error on Monday, which is too bad for VST. This is not my area of expertise, but seems like Abbot is supportive of Arthur D’Andrea. If the Texas house passes this bill, especially with the amount of support the Senate (27-3), this will put Abbot in a tough position. After reading several articles, I'm unclear how the house will react to this.In my opinion, if this passes/signed as is, it will be a net negative to net neutral for VST as they were long to neutral on Thursday and Friday. The only upside I can construe is if PUC is forced to make changes, and they reprice Monday while they are at it.ERCOT is in such a mess."
Stock just screams buy to me. Don't understand the reaction to the earnings report and projection.
"A big hedge fund apparently started taking a large position in VST last week, as did a Swiss firm (Swiss National Bank). Look for it on the paid version of Bloomberg. The smart money apparently getting long on Vistra in advance of HB4492's official rubber stamp passage by Governor Abbot!Disclosure: Do your own research instead of relying on my information; and come to your own conclusions. I am long Vistra with shares and also call options."
"I usually take what the propaganda articles say like a grain of salt, but this recent Simply Wall St article had an interesting sentence in it: “You can see in the graphic below that Vistra has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Renewable Energy industry (6.9%).” In less then two weeks of announcing they’re dropping they’re coal generation they are now a full fledge “renewable”???? Is this how management is now promoting the company?"
"As some have stated, ERCOT is a mess, a poster child against deregulation. This scarcity concept did not work. Is there a possibility the entire deregulation program would scrapped and return to all out full regulation? I live in the St Louis area and we can choose any electric supplier we want as long as it's Ameron. This may mean Texas would be cut up with only one supplier per area. The supplier would be entitled to specify rates based on return of capital. Rate increases must be approved by public service commissions. The suppliers would be responsible to ""winterize"" the entire generation apparatus and allowed rate increases for the funding. How would VST fare is such an arrangement?"
https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/business/article249134985.html
Seriously a beat great news on more customers buy backs dividends at down the stock go’s. Will this stock ever move to where all the analysts have it?
"As I’ve been stating for several years this management team is incapable of producing the shareholder value needed to grow this company. They are there and paid significantly to generate positive results so any failure is ultimately their responsibility and it is time they are held accountable for it. Another disappointing YOY result begs the question, how much longer do the shareholders (you) put up with the Board, putting up with the lack of results from this Exec Leadership group? Enough is enough, they’ve had their chance, its time for a change. I know most people right now are focused in on the winter storm consequences, those yet to come, but if you want a real picture of Vistra look at the longer term failure that’s become a normal occurrence. I suggest at the next Proxy vote of every shareholder vote to replace every Board member and demand a change starting at the top. Something has to get their attention as something has to change this incompetence and failure is not acceptable year after year. On another note, I also thinks it’s close to bonus time for Vistra, so if any Exec gets 1 penny of bonus money for another year of under achievement every Exec and Board member should be replaced ASAP! It’s time the focus of Vistra Management becomes the shareholders and not just their own pockets. Sorry for the rambling but I, like many, have lost to much money waiting on things to change."
All the great things their doing here why is the stock punished so badly today
Anyone Know any news?Very nice price action.
"As expected, Just Energy just declared bankruptcy. The filing notes counterparties that they currently have agreements with, and Vistra is not listed. They may have outstanding balances with ERCOT from the February weather event, and Vistra may be on the other side of that. We will find out more as it winds its way through the courts."
"FWIW, Vistra passes the screen for high 3-5 year appreciation potential, according to ValueLine (where I start due diligence, not that they are infallible). They use algorithms, of course, but as overseen by a human analyst. They project a target price range of $35-$85 for that 3-5 year period, but they are less sanguine about the coming 18 months, projecting a price of $7-$26, with a grim midpoint of $16. I know little about the Texas energy sector, to be honest, but my position is modest, and I am holding. I appreciate the thoughtful and helpful comments here, bull and bear and in between."
I wonder if the Natural Gas pipelines will force majeure contracts since it's too hot this time.
"Looking at NEE, its a shame VST is trading at such a discount. NEE’s energy breakdown by source (data from Sustainability>Overview>By the numbers on NEE website ), 58% of generation comes from Natural Gas +Nuclear vs 53% of VST. The difference is looking at the coal generation of 5% for NEE vs 20% EBITA for VST. If VST got rid of 15% of coal generated EBITA, and traded at NEE’s valuation, it would be $83 a share. Depending on the timing of VST’s $1.5B of buybacks (i.e. assuming they go through at today’s prices), its $98 a share.Both NEE and VST have gas turbines that can be retrofit should hydrogen become economical. VST has the biggest battery in the world, VST is committing $500M+ in green investments annually. Depending on the legislation coming out of Washington, VST is better positioned than NEE. Hopefully the price action will reflect this."
"I don't agree Uri was a ""black swan"" event and should have been included in cash flow statements. I would have liked a question along the lines if there is 10 days in January 2022 where the temperature stays below 10 degrees, what would be the financial impact? There was some discussion of some consumer rate increases but nothing definitive. More investment is required for so called winterizing and there must be rate increases to pay for that. What is with that $10,000 to businesses? Who is paying for that insurance? All in all, I would appreciative exactly how excess cash floe is going to increase the stock price?"
"The lack of identity hurts VST. It's been traded down as though it’s an oil stock, and isn’t fetching a premium like a ESG and isn’t valued as a utility. At the current valuations, I don’t see the benefit of being a publicly traded company and suspect management feels the same way. VST is going to repurchase shares like mad the next few years (see $1.5B repurchase or 17% of the company) and if the market cap doesn't reflect its value, they will be positioned for a MBO like Dell or buyout from another company. I think most realistically there will be a price correction and everyone will be happy.Some perspective here is useful: The valuation has only been disjointed for 9 months. When it was trading in the $27 per share range, that is a low but reasonable valuation of ~$15B.Many investors were burned on this from bankruptcy in 2016, so big institutional investors are waiting for that IG rating in 2021Scarcity pricing has been pretty flat in the last 6 months, so there likely won't be a huge beat. If there was a spike in scarcity pricing, there would be new money entering VSTThe CEO bought shares after Q2. I could see multiple insiders going in a few days after the Q4 report (i.e. when the blackout period is over). The timing would work out with the start of the $1.5B share buybacks and the forthcoming IG status."
Who in their right mind is selling this here lol?
"Three questions regarding the Texas event:1. Who does Vistra pay the billion dollar loss to?2. Other than Vistra, which companies are the losers and which are the winners?3. Why can't all participants that lost just declare force majeure and call it a day?"
"Will be very interesting to hear an attempt at litigation against Vistra...“So you’re suing us for running at a loss to keep 10% of market share over and above our usual base provided with power because our natural gas providers didn’t winterize their pipelines and we had to buy gas & oil on the market at exorbitant prices and then donated $5M to help people recover?”“Also you ignored our warnings.”Maybe Texas should just regulate its entire market and let Vistra run it. They could do a better job than the clown show we have here.Also, anyone who thinks this is bad business practice is myopic and doesn’t understand long term value creation."
"I'm not sure if anyone has access to the Morningstar report that was just released, but the analyst doesn't even know how to look up accurate surge pricing data: ""...since Feb. 11, prices have topped $1,000/MWh on 106 hours and hit the $9,000/MWh system cap on 12 hours. Power prices still topped $1,000 per MWh on 16 of the 24 hours on Feb. 17, according to ERCOT data."""
"This new strategy seems to be working well as we close in a 40% drop in value from the high in less then a year. With $400m left unused in what was the original stock by back program still available maybe it’s time to step back and reevaluate what the plan is. At $18/ share we could buy back 22+m shares that’s more then moves in a month of trading. Oh yea, that would make since for the stock holder not the insiders, what was I thinking? This management team looking out for the share holders? My bad!"
Vistra Is Maintained at Overweight by Morgan Stanleyanalysts know the situation!
Printing as I predicted
purchased 170 shares @ 16.94. don't know much about this company but it sounds very under valued
ERCOT just blew through $3000/MWh for day-ahead pricing. I would love to hear a mid-quarter update during the earnings call regarding how much capacity is capitalizing on the scarcity events of the current cold wave. I have no idea why VST was down today - they are making millions in incremental cash flow. I am hoping they are scooping up more shares at these prices.
"No utility hedges 100 percent. There are peakers duct burners etc. that do not get hedged, in addition to the likelihood that they kept their portfolio open ~5% in case of forced outages. On top of that, load shedding is only a plus to those serving retail load."
"Vistra is now offering a lottery where by an employee can win $25,000 to $50,000 by getting a vaccination. There will be a total of 8 winners. I am in favor of vaccination but doesn't a prize of 50 grand seem just a tad excessive? This is carrot to extreme when the stick would work so much better, say, an added 200 bucks per month for health insurance. Another example of our CEO aspiring to sainthood."
"I still don't fully understand how they lost up to $1.3B when they were generating some 12-14MW throughout the week at $9k MWh. It just doesn't make sense. The fact that one NG supplier can force majeure out of a delivery for another to sell at spot price is wild. If they were generating that much, how are they in the hold so badly?This $1.3B loss materially affects the company for the long term. IG status will likely get delayed, share repurchase delayed, any M&A will kill any shot of IG upgrades, nearly a full year of FCF gone. This is a huge setback for VST."
VST is a cash making machine. It has profitable business—Long term is a great stock to hold/buy.
"As the press release states, Vistra is open for business and making epic amounts of profit. My only concern at this point is how much of the hundreds of millions in free cash flow they have generated will be clawed back/donated to those less fortunate marketers/customers."
"The impact of the one-time event is baked-in the the price now. It will go up very soon, The smaller players got wiped out in the storm. It’s a big win for Vistra as most people will now move to it for their retail energy."
"I understand the recent financial hit, but I’m having trouble understanding how a company on a cash flow basis with solid dividend, share repurchases, and investing for growth can be this cheap? What I am missing on this company? Where is the hidden risk? I would love to own this privately. Surprised Private Equity hasn’t tried to scoop this up."
I believe VST has been green 7 days in a row!
Massive insider buys by numerous board members in recent days. These are NO window-dressing purchases. The bottom is in.
"ERCOT was producing ~50 MW for Monday and Tuesday. 25-30% is 12.5-15MW (out of the 18.3 MW of VST capacity within ERCOT). Rolling blackouts will reduce their retail exposure, though I'm not entirely sure how much of the 12.5-15MW was already accounted for in supply obligations. Assuming they come out neutral here, with forwards spiking and REP's going under, they are coming out on top. If they somehow are a net seller (still not sure they are), that is even better."
"I don't care much for a company that depends on ""scarcity"" for a good portion of profits, but this situation in Texas is Scarcity with a capital S. VST has a big retail presence and also is in a position where some power can be sold to others with a retail presence at extremely high prices. Doesn't one offset the other? Does one outweigh the other and to which extent? Or is VST in the position where the company has excess capacity to satisfy their retail customers as well as sell some to other utilities?"
"In Speculative Freenzy. A Real Company trading a few % off book value, paying a solid dividend, and producing society/life essential energy is shunned upon. VST Shareholders will be rewarded richly."
"What's confusing to me is that with all the uncertainty regarding the power situation in Texas and specifically VST, why are all these companies like Morgan Stanly still maintaining price targets in the mid 20's??-some have downgraded to what amounts to neutral positions from ""buys"" but none has come out with a ""sell"" recommendation-"
"Ha ha, you look at yahoo summary chart periods for: 5 days, 1 month, YTD, 6 months, 1 year, all are RED. One year is the worst, excluding the spike in December 2020, you can draw a straight negative slope line.Sometimes, I wonder what logic I use when making the buy decision. All these excel spreadsheets I make on weekends can't be useless?Historically 1st quarter is supposed to be the worst cash flow for utility companies. Moving forward, VST quarterly revenue should be increasing (summer utilizes greatest power generation). Summer of 2021 is supposed to be another record setter in Gulf Coast.Fingers crossed, VST share price for 1st week of June should be better than 3 or 4th week of May.Hopefully with modest legislative help, anticipated reduced hurricane events for 2021 predicted by the meteorologists, the share price should increase accordingly over the course of the year.The 2nd and 3rd quarter are supposed to be the strongest for utilities companies, with the greatest power generation associated with Gulf area heat, and the corresponding"
Does anyone have any opinions on the repricing debacle - which will be most advantageous for VST. And more importantly when is this going to happen for its Not an “If” more like a “When” (how will they do it to appease both public pricing and address the bleeding of some of the smaller utility companies that were significantly impacted). The sooner this repricing is made clear the faster we should recover back to 20s (few weeks); ideally if we gain more customers and/or neutral/null impacts from the reprice changes.

Great buy and hold
"Article titled, ""Vistra CEO: Electricity generators and natural gas producers must meet reliability standards"" is an op-ed by Curt Morgan (CEO) talking about how the Natural Gas suppliers were the issue behind the storm costs. The natural gas lobby has so far been extremely successful in fending off any legislation on winterization, all but ensuring next time will be another financial windfall for them. I view this as a Hail Mary to put pressure on the legislature to include winterization of the pipelines into their legislation. I doubt it will make a difference."
Natural Gas will be $5 by the end of the year - so all the Natural Gas that VST saved because they bought at $3 spot will be used next winter at a 40% automatic profit.
"Massive losses for 2021, no more stock buybacks, so let's keep shutting down the fossil units!"
"This gonna drop to $17 and a bit below that, there’s no catalyst for anything positive on the revenue and growth front ..."
"from bloomberg:""A 100-megawatt wind farm in Texas that might have normally made almost $40,000 over a two-day period in February could reap more than $9.5 million on Monday and Tuesday alone, said Nicholas Steckler, a power-markets analyst at BloombergNEF."""
"Special Session in Texas scheduled by Abbott for July 8th; Lt Governor Dan Patrick specifically said he will seek special session to also pass, as additional reform and remedy for Uri's fall out, a refund/credit to the market for the 32 hours when $9k prices continued even after the outage, after which the prices should have returned to more normal levels far below $9k. This rebate was in the final version of HB4492 but got struck at the last minute; Lt. Governor was visibly upset about it. Expect it to be addressed in the Special Session. If so, Vistra will benefit hugely, and Vistra shares can be expected goes above $26 per share over the next 12 months (not including additional gains from the dividends). Disclaimers: I am long Vistra; do your own homework and independent analysis before dealing in shares of Vistra."
Showing Strength!!
Check Reuters Texas PUC the vote is a slam dunk for Friday. Looking for another lift after the announcement.
"Some thoughts from the call:VST will have a capital allocation presentation before the November conference call. It sounds like its mostly stock buybacks combined with a TBD form of long term debt (but cheaper financing) for infrastructure projects. They likely will not peruse JVs, but rather use convertible preferreds or sell a portion of the assets (so VST retains control/governance of the projects, but allows them to grow at a reasonable cost of capital). VST believe they can identify profitable projects where there isn’t congestion (i.e. opportunistic projects). IG rating is no longer a concern or their goal. The capital allocation plan will try to convey long term the growth (Renewables and Batteries) with the current cash flow machine (thermals) over the next decade (vs the few years of guidance currently provided). Regarding the stock buybacks: “if others don’t believe in us, we have to believe in ourselves”, “it’s a good use of capital in our mind”, “The top use of capital of our cash making machine is our stock”, “We could reevaluate that (canceling the share buybacks in 2021)”They absolutely dismissed the likelihood of a go-private scenario.One piece that I missed is, did they address the amount they expected from the retail bill credits?"
so VST is closing a plant in Ohio. tell me how is VST going to replace the lost power? putting a ton of batteries is NOT going to do it.
"This meeting on the 26th is going to be good news. Although sometimes it backfires. Management believes this may help the stock price, at the least we get the final damage."
"Now that Morgan was shut out at the legislature he can go back to his real passion, social justice virtue signaling. It appears they wasted a lot of money lobbying in Austin yet the gas industry cleaned their clocks."
Yah!!!! Green Day! Finally - now let’s hope we don’t give it all back tomorrow!
"As VST trades around the $17 level, the Jan 22 $20 put options are priced around $5. For anyone thinking the common stock will be above $15 in 10 months, this looks like a really good bet."
"Article titled, ""Texas PUC Chair resigns, following pressure from governor, refusal to reprice $16B ERCOT overcharge"" Tonight, I asked for and accepted the resignation of PUC Commissioner Arthur D'Andrea,"" Abbott said in a press release. ""I will be naming a replacement in the coming days who will have the responsibility of charting a new and fresh course for the agency. Texans deserve to have trust and confidence in the Public Utility Commission, and this action is one of many steps that will be taken to achieve that goal.""D'Andrea's resignation leaves the commission without any commissioners. Former Chair DeAnn Walker resigned earlier this month, followed by Commissioner Shelly Botkin. Seven members of the ERCOT board have resigned and CEO Bill Magness was fired, all in response to the February events."

"ERCOT's interpretation of the default uplift rule could single handedly save VST several hundred million dollars versus VST's initially estimated loss range from Uri. Ercot now officially says only $2.5mm per month can be allocated to whole market, for the payment defaults of rayburn, brazos, entrust, etc. That means that 2bb+ figure will be assessed over roughly 96 years!Say vst has 33% of total texas retail load and thus had $667,000,000 share of at least 2 billion in total defaults. Instead of owing ercot $667,000,000, now it is only 33% of 2.5mm per month! Hugely helpful for Vistra. Vst wont mention this till legislative sessions done because vst is smart and wants to keep the sympathy... but it's a game changer!!!Disclaimer: do your own research and independently verify everything i say or said."
I sold a few days back at 23 a share. good call I guess.
"RVING, Texas, April 23, 2021 -- Vistra (NYSE: VST) will host an investor call on Monday, April 26, 2021, to provide updated 2021 guidance, including an update on the financial impact of Winter Storm Uri, and to discuss near-term capital allocation plans. Management will present the materials during a live conference call and webcast beginning at 8 a.m. EDT (7 a.m. CDT).￼""Vistra recognizes that the effect of Uri on our company is the most important near-term uncertainty for the financial markets and is presenting a significant overhang on our equity. As soon as we received and processed the likely final substantive information driving the financial impacts of the storm from ERCOT, we decided to hold an investor call to provide an update. We wanted to share this information as soon as we had a final estimate so that we can begin to rebuild from the very strong core of our company, continue our transformation, and get back on track to reaching our full value,"" said Curt Morgan, chief executive officer of Vistra."
"Independent Power Producers Industry Median PE is 19. VST trades at 11. At the industry Median, price should be $34/share. With $1.5B in share buybacks at current prices (i.e. 16% of the company), it should trade at $40 a share at the Industry Median.This is at current guidance ~90% hedged. Any scarcity events or upside events, earnings will be even higher."
"I bought some ET when the price for natural gas shot up. It worked out OK, but I did not know much about the company. Now it seems as if the switch to renewables is resulting in removal of fossil fuel generating units is processing faster than installation of renewables. This may lead to a increased demand for natural gas relative to what is available. VST and other suppliers may have to pay more than anticipated."
"According to the Wall StJournal, blackouts and brownouts are pre-ordained in CA and Texas this summer due to a shortage in generation capability. I would think this would present an opportunity to VST, but apparently not as the stock goes nowhere. Isn't this an ideal time to negotiate a better deal from ERCOT? To me, it seems as if Morgan is hoping for sainthood as opposed to running the company for the people who own it."
"My expectation is that because of the new customer addition, this will result in double digit growth % in its revenues. Moreover, with the expected inflation, VST will increase its electricity bills accordingly. This will also boost up revenues significantly. I see people with the concern what if VST faces another weather event like this and incur another huge loss. I think by that time, VST will prevent itself from the unforeseen event by implementing new procedures -- the world is not stationary and work in 1-dimensional. I also have seen more population allocating from other states to Texas in the US. The world is also demanding EVs. The more EVs on the street, this demand could push the electricity price even higher up. I see a very nice recovery from this company and a bright future in this sector in general. Long VST~"
Curt’s “Money Making Machine!”!Just hold on until next year or the year after or maybe three years or four or maybe???
"There may be a larger than expected write off due to premature closing of coal plant. Of course, this is a ""non cash"" loss, but a loss is a loss."
"If the market is truly a 9 month to year forward looking mechanism, as all the experts say it is, then the reaction to this plan is not looking very positive for the shareholders. I agree that there is no momentum, and that the shorts are digging in but I’ve been posting for sometime that management can change that by kicking in the buy back program. They had it in place in last years grand plan but halted it with $400 million left to go. That’s why it’s hard to trust them this time around. With 98% of the stock held by institutions it wont take much to get things moving up. Which is why I don’t understand the reluctance to boast the share price......unless there’s a grander grand plane being cooked up. Does anyone know what Morgan’s plans are regarding retirement? What’s his compensation package if he leaves under a “Change of Control” action? And if anyone doesn’t think these crooked Executives don’t set these situations up to benefit themselves first, I have a bridge I’ll sell you."
Insiders have been exercising boatloads of options and making sizable open market purchase of VST stock since late December and again after the freak storm and weather-related rate news. Is big battery news coming? Follow the money.
"In the days before the storm, VST management had already escalated to ERCOT that their internal forecasts were off (per Bloomberg Article). You would have to imagine Vistra would lock in NG prices and position themselves for this surge event.Bloomberg Article: Days Before Blackouts, One Texas Power Giant Sounded the Alarm"
"Battery problems at Moss Landing. Doesn't it seem as if there are many technical problems with batteries? As a country we are rushing into renewable energy without having the essential storage issue resolved. Wouldn't it be wise not to announce hard dates for renewable energy, perhaps slow up a bit to spend more time developing battery technology, and use our cheap, abundant, reasonably clean, and relievable natural gas in the meantime? There now have been instances of Tesla's catching on fire, burning the garage down, and then burning the house down. It is now recommended to park Teslas outside, I mean, seriously????"
"I've been watching what's been going on in the Texas energy market. Under the current system, competitive markets deregulated it is my understanding that Texas does not tap into other states during emergency circumstances, like the weather event in question.It would seem very logical, that the fastest fix would be to tap into another state's grid system, during an emergency situation. This is in addition to, deploying microgrids and other backup systems, including generation,I think when the dust settles here, you will see Texas opening up with other states. Texas has been an independent grid operator for a long time, and this event was foreseen."
"If you can't handle a little volatility, get out. This was $17 last December. This isn't drastically different. They are paying you a 4% dividend to wait. This is a PE of less than 10. Should have increased user growth and opportunities. I can guarantee there will be winterization in the future which should solve all the issues. I am not worried, will make more than 50% returns within the next 2 years."
Sounds like a pretty good press release...without knowing the fine details.
"I'm not that familar with the Utility business and how the great freeze has effected VST....The below statement was published in SeekingAlpha. Anybody have an opinion as to the net effect on VST?....................San Antonio's public power utility CPS Energy today filed a lawsuit against ERCOT, seeking to prevent the grid operator from attempting to recoup from CPS the costs that other energy retailers have not paid.An independent market monitor has said ERCOT overcharged by $16B during the severe weather and that it should conduct a repricing to provide relief; yesterday, it said that while it still estimates $16B in overcharges occurred, the most that could be recovered for consumers was $3.2B."
$25 stock easy.
The company a retailer Just Energy filled bk. Stock dropped 70%. If the governor gets his way 16B will be reversed in legislation. That will help I think.
If Vistra comes out of this with either a net gain/not a large loss there will be so many retail customers ripe for the picking. Really hoping this event provides an opportunity to see a consolidation of the competitive retail market in Texas since many retailers are expected to go under.
ha ha 4.7% up on 7/7
"There's always some issue that pops up with VST. Agree that it's cheap, but clearly it's cheap for a reason. Could be worth a lot more if they could stabilize earnings."
"Putting VST in perspective:1. VST is launched a $1.5Bn share repurchase program that began this year (they previously had suspended it to be prudent in regards to COVID and to focus FCF on paying down debt).2. VST (at the current share price of $20.99 and a 2021 FCFbG of $2,165BN) yields a 20%+ FCF yield which is not expected to decrease in the foreseeable future. If their investment/project minimum hurdle rate is in the mid-teens (e.g., 16%), it makes sense for them to view a share repurchase like an investment/project up to $27.57. Given the level of certainty of a share repurchase, one could argue that the minimum hurdle rate would be lower but let's leave it at $27.57 for a second to be conservative.3. For further validation why that share repurchase level is realistic, back in 2019 when the company was less profitable, ladened with more coal plants, had more leverage, faced higher interest rates, had lower credit ratings, and less growth prospects, the company executed significant share purchases averaging $25/share (NOTE: This is the average, not the maximum).4. Additionally, the ratings agencies are all indicating an IG rating this year with multiple up-ratings last year to one notch below IG and statements indicating to expect the IG rating in the second half of 2021. What does that mean? It means: a. lower costs of capital, b. attraction by institutional investors who are chartered/limited to institutional investments, c. Improved approval/bid rates from regulatory agencies on both the local, state and federal levels, and d. better terms with partners who price in accordance with counterparty risk.5. If that's not enough, don't forget that these guys have topped their forecasts since going public and what makes them different and able to do so in their competitive markets (e.g., ERCOT) is their focus on ""integrated/vertical"" development which improves their margins and reduces volatility of their earnings streams. 6. They have hit their leverage target in Q4 of 2020 and that leverage ratio will continue to decrease as their top line adjusted EBITDA numbers continue to rise.7. They just increased their dividend payouts for 2021 which will take effect in 2021 with an eye toward increasing it further in 2022. 8. They now have the largest Energy Storage System in the world with dozens of other Energy Storage systems across the Texas, California and permitting in other states beyond those two. Among the utility players in the world, they are the leader in ESS and their footprint is getting larger (with even hints of some international plays as well.....you can do your own research to find out about that).9. They have a pipeline of ESS/Solar deals already confirmed for this year and next which will soon replace all their coal plant generation and are set on contracts/agreements with attractive terms.10. Don't believe me? Well talk to the guys who get paid to do this for a living: Morgan Stanley, UBS, BMO Capital and Credit Suise all have Price Targets over $30 ranging from $31 - $34 per share. Already, the stock, as predicted with the share repurchase program just starting, is seeing a run-up and that run-up is only beginning.I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock run-up well past $25 per share and have a floor value of $27.5 in the next six months, and once the IG rating goes through, don't be surprised to see it push past $30 per share.VST is a solid bet that weathered/thrived during the Coronavirus and will continue to do so as it has done every quarter since going public.Enjoy the ride and Happy Investing!"

"I listened to the updating and conclude that everyone involved with the power supply in Texas has their head in the sand. First, Uri is not an isolated event occurring every 50 years.

Does anyone know what the exact date is that Vistra is going to announce they’re new magical capital plan? I thought they said sometime in Sept?
I thinking to average up. what do you think?

We should start a stock holder action committee. We could create a simple online form for us like a petition. Gather it up and submit to the board to sell the company. Starting bid 37 bucks a share.
"Hey Curt and team, now that you’ve got the stock price back down 18% again might be a good time to kick that buy back plan in to gear. Very cleaver and strategic move!"
"Just catching up on the today's call for the horrific $2.075 billion loss incurred in just one week: ""Vistra believes we performed well at what we controlled; event led to an unpredictable and substantially altered risk profile."" (p. 9)No, you intentionally shuttered baseload assets over the past few years that are in your load demand area (north), while growing capacity in areas outside of that area (south). In the event of additional ERCOT transmission emergencies (heat wave, fire, etc) that causes a loss of the ability to transfer power south to north, this is going to happen again and again. Yet they continue to blame the grid, legislators, gas suppliers, customers and everyone else. Who are they going to blame this summer when the grid fails for a different reason?The shortsightedness of this generation strategy at Vistra is astounding in its gross negligence and one that could sink the company. They are still proud and bragging that they shut down their coal plants in Texas (p. 13) and are looking at ACCELERATING the spending of more money on intermittent assets that run at 10-30% capacity factors when needed. (p. 16) They kept repeating on the call, ""We can mitigate this power risk"". No, not with the current strategy you can't.You can quote me: outside of cashing out executives, they will never buy another share back again. For every 1,000 MW of ERCOT coal that they retire, they will need to spend two years of free cash flow just keep their peak capacity at the same level. It's a treadmill that doesn't stop, because the whole game ends for Vistra when the nukes retire."
Be aware of this company’s covid test kit scam. This management should be in jail for their scam and lie to shareholders. $VST worth $0.05 period
"In the next week into December 29th, 30th, this is where I am going to be putting some money. Pretty clear some tax loss harvesting has been occurring here. I will be more than willing to ride the January effect here for a likely 10% easy gain. I have an 1/3 of a position in already, will likely add the rest then. Just be patient."
"I worked for Dynegy. Early this month we were acquired by Vistra. This Texas utility company so far looks good. We at our power plant like the way they run things and look forward to being part of this large retail and generation entity.Great price action on their stock too. We like what our ""new"" CEO said last week in the webinar.Good luck longs."
"It's encouraging that even though 3 brokerages lowered their target prices to mid 20's, there were no downgrades-think the street still has confidence in this company to weather the storm"
Does anyone know if HB4492 Securitization of extraordinary expenses due to February's event applies to de-regulated utilities like VST? Appears the market thinks so? This will be a significant reversal of the earnings forecast.
"Haha, way oversold! The loss estimates are way over-inflated. ERCOT's resettlement numbers are looking like it'll be less of an impact. See Just Energy's (one of the last retailers left in Texas) guidance today on the resettlement. The likely real loss could be a lot lower, almost 2/3rd lower."
"No matter which metric you use to value VST, it should be trading to at minimum $30 a share. Investors need to remain patient and eventually the market will realize the value, another company will buyout VST, or VST will take take itself private (MBO). This is one of the most frustrating stocks to watch, but the value proposition is absolutely there."
Texas lawmakers propose electricity market bailout after winter stormhttps://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/06/texas-electric-bills-winter-storm-bailout/
"With the S&P being up over 15% on the year and Vistra down over 30% my guess is most Institutional’s holders are doing some tax harvesting on the loss (off set their other gains). Thus, pushing the price down even further. If you have the kahunas to stay in and loose the opportunity dollars of the market, you will probably come out ok later next year when Management gets their xxxx together and restarts the buy back plan. Which they shouldn’t have ever stopped last year. Fiduciary leadership, well worth the above average compensation and bonus plans they have in place."

The Texan special legislative session to mostly take away civil liberties from minorities and partly to fix ERCOT will hit issues with the Democrat's fleeing to Washington DC.
For Longs why would this stock recover anytime soon considering the recent events. For Bears who have done DD - do u think this will continue to trend lower if any speculation of regulation is proposed by TX Governor or other

Is this a relatively safe play assuming the Dems sweep both Georgia Senate seats or is it going to get hammered like most of the rest of the market because of those results?
"Owned by some Koch brothers for 96 MillionOwned by mark lacey $114 MillionOwned by some of the biggest vulture/value funds.What you have here is a dirt cheap, inflation protected cash generating machine."
"VST's cash flow and by having financing debt, it is able to absorb the 1.3B one time fee without any issue. My understanding is that because of the BK of Texas energy producers, VST will take over a significant number of NEW CUSTOMERS from the market, dominating the market share, and FREE growth opportunity given with this weather event. Its share price could fluctuate for short term but it will gradually go back to where it was, and the NEW CUSTOMERS will add monstrous additional free cash flow in the future financial performance. It is now time to accumulate."
"VST is certainly acting poorly. I miscalculated the competitive position of the stock. The company was given nothing or any way to account for the massive loss last winter. This loss was completely due to the strange arrangement with ERCOT. Presently, VST has the exact same situation facing them this winter. I thought VST was in a position to demand significant rate increases, but that is not the case. So, as has been stated, the stock is going nowhere. Compare the performance with the S & P 500 in the past year, and that shows the dramatic under performance."
not going down. sell off is over. buying in on the dip is open season.
"Received proxy vote today - voted “against” all. Continued failure is not acceptable, something has to change and it has to start now. Normally the past is the best indicator for the future and Vistra’s past performance is poor. Time to make a change. As said in Chicago - vote early and vote often! Hoping for a change."
This is a pretty easy story with limited downside. Basic electric utility company that earns 3 billion and has the cash flow to pay down debt for 2020 and in September said they are going to switch gears and announce capital plan of share buy backs and dividend raises. This isn’t a get rich quick but should be a steady rise to 26
"The 8k filed afterhours was closing on the $1.25B bond issuance. I'm curious if there will be a change to the capital allocation plan over the next few months. They aren't getting IG status until 2023, and the net benefit to IG debt will be negligible compared to non IG debt issued in 2021. Why not throw $500M at share repurchases if they can repurchase at an EV/EBITDA of 5? What is the downside?"
"Shafin said in the most recent interview, invest in $VST for the next 10,20 or 30 years LOL, what a joke,"

"From the Q4 transcript, ""Stephen Byrd -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst: Very good. I could ask 50 more questions, but I will hand it over to others. Thank you very much.Curtis A.

"According to SimplyWall Vistra is traded 81% below fair price... it means the fair price is 89,8$ per share... well i think this is great opportunity for easy money :)"
"This market seems ready to take a tumble, but I bought in at 17.80 before the new update. Once legislation and lawsuits are complete, there is little doubt the losses will be as large as currently forecasted. Even so, If the truly gained a large increase of customers, the loss would be worth that acquisition cost. One major concerns I have is, if there is another adverse advent, it is going to stretch the balance sheet quite a bit if it occurs in the short term. If the company can get through another year it should be well on its way to investment grade."
"When CEO lies to shareholders, the company looses its value and credit. Shafin and Vahid lied to us and pumped $VST on covid test kit sales and NDAs. Which turns out to be a big scam."
It’s a bold new strategy! Let the share price continue to drop 40 to 50% off the highs until we announce this grand new cap plan and get a 10% bump. That should make the Fund Managers come running back in.
Wish any new short term /swing traders luck! Unfortunately I was looking for a quick gain however this is going in the opposite direction; just sold since profits kept disappearing. I am out as of yesterday to many unknowns in the interim however based on my past luck watch the stock take off next week! :)
Buy all you can here folks! This will be over $18 soon. Should never have gotten this low in the first place.

"ATTENTION: Do NOT invest in this junk. This company added over 15 million shares since last year to OS shares, diluted $VST by 20%. Yesterday they added another 1 million shares and diluted $VST by 1%. They have $0 sales from their 23 NRs covid test kits. 0 shares bought back since the beginning of this year. CEOs lost credit. Full of bluff. This belongs to $0.1-$0.2"

"It was proposed to shift $250,000,000 from border security to shoring up the power grid, but the proposal was shot down. Vistra should have insisted on grid improvements as part of their negotiation with ERCOT. I don't think Vistra got paid a dime for adding gas storage to generating plants. Also, if there is a cold snap, Vistra should put their customers first and not agree to try to cover shortcomings for those who had signed up for other electricity suppliers. Of course, Vistra may not be in a competitive position to take hard lines."
"The overall financial impact from winter storm Uri is still being calculated, but Vistra expects it will have a material adverse impact on its financial results driven by generation output being constrained due to challenges with receiving a steady supply of fuel for some plants as well as challenges with handling fuel already on site given the freezing conditions. As a result of these challenges, Vistra had to procure power in the ERCOT market at prices at or near the price cap to meet its supply obligations.2021 Guidance and Capital AllocationAs a result of Winter Storm Uri hitting Texas last week, Vistra is not able to reaffirm or adjust its 2021 guidance as Vistra does not yet have enough information to provide an exact estimate of the one-time financial impact of this unprecedented winter storm. While the financial impacts of Winter Storm Uri to Vistra are not yet finalized, Vistra management preliminarily estimates the one-time adverse impact will be in the range of ~$900 million to $1,300 million. This estimated range is preliminary and based on currently available information and management estimates. The final amount of the estimated loss is subject to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, outstanding pricing, load, and settlement data from ERCOT, potential state corrective action, or the outcome of potential litigation arising from this event. Vistra will provide a further update as information is available, the timing of which is currently unknown.Vistra continues to be committed to our capital allocation plan, including our recommended dividend trajectory and debt reduction expectations. Vistra will provide a further update on 2021 capital allocation as estimates of the financial impact of Winter Storm Uri are finalized, the timing of which is currently unknown."
"Vistra is slowly but surely dealing with the most difficult ""clean"" energy solutions. Moss Landing's first battery (largest in the world) is finished with the second at the same location has broke ground. The next one is about 175 miles south and is the approval stage which is grueling, but they know how to get it done. The positives around Vistra is many, the negatives?? Storage of anything is big business!! data, nat gas, oil, documents, energy, water........."
I sold 5 October $15 puts for $.90 - in at cost of $14.10 if it dips that far by then.
"The Vistra problem -There are three types of energy companies: (1) old, profitable companies that generate steady earnings and cash flows, (2) companies that ebb and flow according to commodity prices, and (3) ""green"" companies that have never generated excess cash flow but are completely reliant on government subsidies and mandates to survive.The companies in the third group, some of which have existed for over 25 years, have never generated earnings or free cash flow. They are merely vampires that suck cash from taxpayers and investors with the promise of ""growth"". They are short- and long-term value destroyers and depend on the force of government diktat to exist. Their ""value"", as they currently do not and have never generate profits, is the present value of all future subsidies and regulations, so people keep buying them in hopes of even more energy authoritarianism.Vistra, along with other utilities and pipelines are in the first group. Vistra's former portfolio of assets was a steady performer, which is why the company has always bragged about its cash flow prospects. However, Vistra's misguided strategy is to quickly move from group 1 to group 3. Unfortunately, that entails jettisoning the very assets that produce the current earnings and cash flow and moving to an uneconomic model. This explains why VST's annual earnings potential has peaked and will never reach that level again.As Vistra struggles to become more ""woke"" and concerned about non-financial benchmarks (as per their management's stated corporate goals), they will become less reliant on earnings and cash flow and more reliant on the next round of government mandates and subsidy programs. Unfortunately, ERCOT is a raw, uncaring capitalistic market, where a group of sellers is matched hourly with a set of buyers at a single price. Some sellers are externally funded by the government through perpetual aid programs and can still exist while offering their services for $0. Vistra is attempting to compete with them while being funded by YOU using the balance sheet of the equity and bond investors.Those mean, dirty fossil plants that the green religious fanatics hate unfortunately do their job well and create massive amounts of economic value. As they are torn down are replaced with plants that run whenever mother nature complies, that economic value is gone forever. Trying to put a band-aid on their inferior operational characteristics with batteries and other uneconomic schemes will not change the basic electrical and economic facts.That's the sad truth of Vistra's future."
"Could the two new PUCT Commissioners appear to be any less impressive at their PUC Open Meeting Debut that is ongoing, as I write? They're speaking only about their apparent buddies' ranches and almost an hour on insignificant issues affecting two ranch owners, while they skipped items 1 through 11 (except for item 8), each of which items needs urgent information. It is a bloodbath in the Texas power and gas markets, and at least so far, the the new PUC Commissioners don't seem to see any sense of urgency.Maybe one of you, if feeling chatty, may want to call in and ask the PUCT why they're ignoring the IMM's recommendations and ignoring the blood bath persisting across Texas, which will deter and hamper further investment in generation and retail technology/infrastructure."
"Do NOT buy $VSTNo cashNo Revenue20% Dilution in less than a year0 sales of their Scam Covid test kitSo, if you still believe in a CEO who scammed shareholders with Covid test kit bluff, then you deserve To have Looser stamp on your forehead. This company is so sketchy and bogus, they never have a straight simple numbers."
Vistra headed back to $16 or lower.
"This stock is a complete disappointment. A 25% drop in price in less then a year and it started way before Covid so that’s not an excuse. The numbers are improving, growth potential is there, the big negative is that management doesn’t promote share price. Morgan whines about the price being low, but doesn’t even complete the share buyback program which would have pushed the price up. This stock should be trading in the $30 per share range if they’d stop running it like a private equity or hedge fund. With 95% of the stock owned by institutions it shouldn’t take much to create an upside momentum and get the price up. Maybe management is to ingrained in the hedge fund mindset to run a publicly traded company. Maybe it’s time for a change at the top levels?????? It’s sure going no where the way it is!!!"
"Nice bounce today, I feel very comfortable owning this stock at this price. Bought the majority of my stock at 16.70, average price of 17.1. With all of management and board members purchasing stock, this is a very reasonable entry price. This is currently my core holding with 40% of my investment. I will look to sell long dated calls in the next 2-3 months."
"From the Q3 Transcript, ""Looking ahead to 2022, our current expectations for the earnings power of our business are consistent with our average 2020 to 2021 view, in the range of $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and a conversion rate to free cash flow before growth of 65% or more. We believe we can manage our year-to-year earnings volatility within a very tight range and we continue to have confidence in the long-term earnings profile of our business. The market clearly does not share this view. As action on climate change accelerates and private institutions and state and federal policymakers advance policies supporting the development of incremental renewable resources, investors are clearly questioning what this evolving landscape might mean for Vistra. In our view, it is this question that has directly been impacting Vistra's valuation. There is no justification for Vistra to trade at a 20% free cash flow yield based on the performance and financial position of the company.Free cash flow yields at these levels are generally reserved for companies in financial distress with poor performance track records and weak balance sheets. None of this applies to Vistra. The only explanation that seems to make some sense is that the market must expect Vistra will experience future economic distress based on the changing power generation landscape. In our view, Vistra's near-term financial performance supports a free cash flow yield at least in the low double digits, especially when taking into account where the Company's debt trades and the prospects for investment grade credit ratings in the next year. The debt-to-equity risk premium is confounding, rather if you believe in appropriate free cash flow yield for a business with a strong balance sheet and a proven track record on execution should be in the range of 10% to 12%. The recent prices where Vistra's stock has been trading would suggest that the market is assigning virtually zero equity value to Vistra's generation segment. In our view, this is a completely flawed assumption that is likely driven by the emotions of the current ESG environment as opposed to a practical and informed fundamental analysis."""
Well if Vistra was in financial distress they probably wouldn't be donating 5 million dollars.....
"See 4492's definition of uplift charges:""""Uplift charges"" means charges for reliability deployment price adders and ancillary services costs in excess of the commission's system-wide offer cap that were uplifted to load-serving entities on a load ratio share basis due to energy consumption during the period of emergency. The term includes only uplifted amounts and does not include amounts that were part of the prevailing settlement point price.""""Default charges"" means nonbypassable amounts to be charged on all wholesale market transactions administered by the independent organization certified under Section 39.151 for the ERCOT power region, approved by the commission under a financing order to recover qualified costs, that shall be collected by the independent organization, its successors, an assignee, or other collection agents as provided by the financing order.""Load-serving entity"" means a municipally owned utility, an electric cooperative, or a retail electric provider.""Period of emergency"" means the period beginning 12:00 a.m., February 12, 2021, and ending 11:59 p.m., February 20, 2021.""Qualified costs"" means a default balance resulting from the period of emergency that otherwise would be or has been uplifted to other wholesale market participants, together with the costs of issuing, supporting, and servicing bonds and any costs of retiring and refunding existing debt in connection with the issuance of the bonds.Uplift being the key definition."
NRG is up 6% today VSTR should follow suit
"Big drop for VST yesterday! Unless it's just some profit taking on low volume, makes no sense to me. Why would this be going down as interest rates are falling? VST pays a nice dividend. Money moving back into tech probably caused some sector rotation and VST was caught in the selling.Other thoughts?"
"August 5th is the day of the quarterly report and conference call. Should get a better idea of what the company expects reimbursement from URI, any gains in market share and overall performance. There was a seeking alpha article the other day showing Vistra way undervalued compared to its peers. Should be gradual grind higher, although would not be surprised at a $1 to $2 jump after the quarterly report. I also wouldn't be surprised at a slight decline in price. Either case this stock looks like it has strong fundamentals for the future."
"Further substantiation of my MINIMUM $600,000,000 proceeds/credits back to Vistra, thus lowering its fallout from ERCOT from $1.6BB to below $1BB, as the one time hit from Uri. This event effectively removes, imo, any risk of insolvency or a dividend cut, and should put Vistra significantly north of $20/share especially given a huge increase in revenue and load resulting from Uri and moves to POLR (TXU is a POLR). Moreover, if Just Energy, a fraction of TXU's size, will recover US$100,000,000 based on A/S and reliability deployment adders, Vistra's credits may well exceed $800,000,000.Just Energy Announces Texas Legislation Providing Recovery Mechanism for Certain Costs of the Texas Winter Weather EventJune 18, 2021 at 8:00 AM EDTTORONTO, June 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just Energy Group Inc. (“Just Energy” or the “Company”) (OTC: JENGQ), a retail energy provider specializing in electricity and natural gas commodities and bringing energy efficient solutions and renewable energy options to customers, announced today that on June 16, 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 4492 (“HB 4492”), which provides a mechanism for recovery of certain costs incurred by various parties, including the Company, during the extreme weather event in Texas in February 2021 (the “Weather Event”) through certain securitization structures. HB 4492 addresses securitization of (i) ancillary service charges above US $9,000/MWh during the Weather Event; (ii) reliability deployment price adders charged by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (“ERCOT”) during the Weather Event; and (iii) amounts owed to ERCOT due to defaults of competitive market participants, which were subsequently “short-paid” to market participants, including Just Energy, (collectively, the “Costs”).HB 4492 provides that ERCOT request that the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the “Commission”) establish financing mechanisms for the payment of the Costs incurred by load-serving entities, including Just Energy. The timing of any such request by ERCOT, the details of the financing mechanism and the process to apply for recovery of the Costs are undetermined at this time. The Company continues to evaluate HB 4492. Based on current information, if the Commission approves the financing provided for in HB 4492, Just Energy anticipates that it will apply to the Commission to recover approximately US $100 million of Costs. The total amount that the Company may recover through the mechanisms authorized in HB 4492 may change materially based on a number of factors, including the details of an established financing order or orders issued by the Commission, additional ERCOT resettlements, the aggregate amount of funds applied for under HB 4492 by participants, the outcome of the dispute resolution process initiated by the Company with ERCOT, and any potential challenges to the Commission’s order or orders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to recover all of the Costs that it applies for under the Commissions order or orders.About Just Energy Group Inc.Just Energy is a retail energy provider specializing in electricity and natural gas commodities and bringing energy efficient solutions and renewable energy options to customers.

I hope this company helps the share holders out at some point for believing in them at least before Christmas might be my last Christmas haven’t been feeling well at all lately and I invested here seeing they were trying to do the right thing with solar powered equipment and thought maybe I could help them make a better future for the environment but i had no clue immediately after I believed in the company they would depreciate in share price that quickly I’m not a get rich quick guy I hope in the mid term they would do a little more to make share holders more comfortable with holding a big portion of their stock.
