AOS buys Hague. Should add to their longterm value
AOS is up 4.94% to 38.67
AOS is down 4.92% to 42.90
That was a response?
A.O. Smith is down 5.08% to 50.59
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at $45.68
If this goes to $40 it’s such a steal
Ayyy if it goes to 60 I'm at my buy price target
AOS reached a 52 Week low at 36.45
Stock is overpriced in a very overpriced market.
Hoping to buy this <40
It's way to high to buy now!
AOS is down 4.94% to 38.97
I’m buying when P/E ratio hits 19
AOS is down 4.99% to 40.56
Looks like $50 is coming! Good time to add
U.S. housing beginning to pullback and so will this stock price. China will not offset the decline.
"Love everything about company except the price. I do own a little and want to add more, but I don’t understand what the market sees that makes it worth 30x.Temporarily depressed earnings? Nope.High FCF? Nope.Outsized EPS growth? Nope.Obvious M&A target? Nope.It does deserve some premium because it’s a steady 6-7% grower and has defensible moats, but the price still feels very steep."
AOS reached a 52 Week low at 34.41
What's a good entry point? $53-55?
I have been trying to buy this stock but there hasn't been any kind of correction to let me in lol . Would anyone buy here or are we too high to add to positions here? Thanks
AOS is down 4.93% to 40.73

"Last, newest reaction made by Stockguru 12 days ago: We are going under $40? Pleased to give perspective: at almost $47, been risin' daily like the sun. The China-US tariff trade risk slowly giving out positive evidence from both sides....managing expectations - this has to be done right the first time. US pressure points being applied regarding theft of technology (re: Micron's), ill-gotten advantages by Huawei and lying about sales to Iran, etc, etc. US is legally armed, kicking tires, naming names calling them to account."
I think a lot of people are caught up in the tariff war with China. This company is really undervalued right now and has great potential
"if the next round of tarrifs include water heaters, this'll take a hit and it'll be time to back the truck up"
have we bottomed? maybe need another day or two of upward trend?
why is down big???
A.O. Smith is up 4.93% to 40.64
why down today????
AOS is down 4.90% to 45.78
wondering if the financial company who came out with the short report made their money & got out ? Close on 5-15 was $47.90& the report came out 5-16 & closed at $44.89. looks like a low hit on 5-31 @ $40.89. some 3 months later we sit $51.77. KeepClimbing AOS !!!
"Great company with a great balance sheet, lots of growth, amazing div growth and share buybacks. I added to my position today. thank you market"
AOS is down 5.20% to 36.43
I'm surprised AOS is down 1% on a day when it was announced they're being added to the S&P 500. That's a lot of forced buying ahead when the Vanguards of the world have to add AOS to their index funds. 
"I’m seeing EPS growth projections of 20% for 2018. That’d bring the PE down to 25x. Even if you assume that growth levels off to 6-7% a year that’s actually not bad. Does anyone think low single digit growers like KO and PG deserve 22-25x? If not for this flawed idea of “bond substitutes”, which become more unattractive as interest rates climb, those stocks would probably sell for 15x at best. Stocks look pricey in general, but I’m at least seeing a path for AOS to justify its current price."
A.O. Smith is up 4.90% to 56.73
Never seen this kind of sell off in AOS. Must be people getting stopped out. Nothing fundamentally has changed here. Lots of funds were buying last week. I’m adding more here. Very rarely do you get this kind of buying opertunity!
AOS is up 5.06% to 40.15
A.O. Smith is up 5.20% to 57.40
Just added 17k shares. Regarding Sunshine:As far as I understand they have ordered 10k worth of product which is actually not enough to cover the site for a whole month- so BLGO is expecting higher ordering numbers in the future - while republic is still saving an estimated 30-40k $ a month because of CupriDyne's price point- cheaper than previous product. Sounds like a Win- Win & I love it.(Info from shareholder meeting- they did not specifically mention the Sunshine site but referred to the pics)2) my friend who attended the meeting just gave me 2 Cupridyne sample sprays 2 days ago.After extensive testing - don't ask ;). THat stuff is magic - and BLGO is at the very very beginning of taking over that market. Soon first revenue will be reported - also potential happening of CLyra FDA submission and $AOS presentation in the next weeks. Better get those cheap shares!!!
Is anyone able to quantify the size of their relationship with UTP?
Very bullish at anything below $60
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at $46.83
very good earnings again today. I added more at $54
"Nothing done in 2019, no progress"
"Large increase in price per share leading up to earnings, hit 52 week high yesterday, and then a big sell off today after earnings were announced."
"So never owned this but seems interesting. However, isn’t this heavily tied to housing? If that market turns for the worst wouldn’t this get hit very hard"
AOS is down -5.13% to 56.55
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at $40.34
AOS is down 5.02% to 35.00
"Took a chance on this stock recently with a SMALL position at 61 and change (just in case it was peaking). Stock will more then likely collapse down to 50 day average around 58, with a chance it could pierce it and move to 56 and change. Those 2 price points would be good buy more points in my opinion!!"
"Spruce Point is piling on, saying the firm's gross margins ""are either being inflated by management with aggressive accounting, or can't be sustained as local competitors"" catch up. It also sees 45%-60% downside for AOS shares."

"AOS--earnings meet, sales up 11%, articles on what a great company AOS is, guidance up, Zacks says ""buy""...etc.........stock goes down 1.5 %."
Nobody thinks about a water heater until hot water stops working.
with all the companies blaming China and seeing a slow down. I'm a bit worried AOS when it reports a slowdown will miss and test new lows. What everyone's thoughts this week on earnings?
"Jeffrey23 minutes agoT is the BEST stock on ANY market,while uber is the WORST stock on any market$aos $wll $chk $tlrd $akrx"
How the heck could this be down today on a 200+ point up day? I mean AOS is in a ton of ETF's. Makes no sense. Something smells fishy here!!
"I added today at $65.41. I may regret this later, but AOS appears to be in a good space and doing ""everything"" right at this time.My main concerns are the price of steel, possible tarrifs, and a somewhat frothy price per share. Are there other things specific to AOS that we longs should be worrying about? Thanks."
"AOS needs to address these serious allegations whether or not they are false. It’s called “Damage Control.” Ignoring what they are accused of would be foolish. Otherwise, the company will be operating under a cloud of suspicion, and the price per share will get crushed"
A.O. Smith reached a 52 Week high at 55.01
AOS is down 5.32% to 35.80
"Lot of money in China Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!Working capital of $743.4 million at March 31, 2020 was $9.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, as a result of lower accounts payable balances which were partially offset by lower accounts receivable balances, primarily in China. As of March 31, 2020, approximately $295 million of the $551.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held in local currency in China. Through the first four months of 2020, we repatriated $125 million to the U.S."
"Beta is a bit high, dividend is a bit low. Other than that a well run company"
Here's hoping tomorrow's earnings are good enough that we can move up. Its been a tough 2 months.
I think I’ll add some shares on Monday. Price is starting to look right.
"Great company, great earnings and down 4%. This might just be your entry point."
Down 9% before the open and now up in the green.
"Just taking a look at this stock. Paul W. Jones, former CEO and Chairman (now on the BoD), sold 60,000 shares (~20%of his holdings at the time) at $54/share on 08/03/2018. On 02/10/2018, he exercised 163,900 options and sold 140,000 shares at ~50/share."
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at $53.45
Great company. No real growth though
"Nice, it went down pre-market after exceeding expectations"
"didn't think I'd see it go under $50, but here we are. time to move some money around and add."
Some institution buyer is accumulating at about $50 level. Looks like this will go higher to $55 soon
AOS is up 5.14% to 46.06
$22
I'm surprised that there is not much talk on this board about the 100 Mill increase in the share buyback that AOS announced last week.
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at 54.67
A.O. Smith reached a 52 Week low at 37.17
add now or after earnings?
"Have you ever tried to explain to someone why hot water heaters are an exciting investment? Or why mall REITs have high upside potential? If the numbers are on your side, and people look at you like you've lost your mind, that's usually a good sign. "
"How does this stock end UP 8% on earnings miss, and outlook cut? Crazy"
Sleepy company
Someone thinking AOS by USD 70 in three months?
what's a good entry point?
Up on bad news and lower guidance translates into “not as bad as some feared.” Solid company.
I added today under $56. Great entry point for the long haul.
"Wow, absolutely hammered today."
"This selloff on no news or down grades is alarming. I am guessing that there was some heavy institutional selling toward the end of the third quarter (September 30, 2018). A mutual fund or pension fund may have decided to drastically reduce or liquidate their position in AOS. However, my concern is that the selloff has continued into the fourth quarter, which leads me to speculate that some investors are selling because they think AOS's business will be hurt by the US/China Trade conflict. The perception of investors is more important than the actual facts. If investors perceive that the US/China Trade conflict will hurt AOS, they will sell even if AOS is relatively unaffected by the conflict. The market is NOT rational. Feelings and perceptions are often more important than the facts. I would like to be a buyer, but right now AOS is acting like a ""falling knife""."
I had to add at today. Too cheap to pass up at $44.25.
AOS is up 4.96% to 41.56
AOS is up 5.16% to $44.46
some people out there still know a good deal when they see it
good God this is a boring stock but it's a keeper.
"Over $50!!! Man, I thought I’d never see this without a trade deal."
Wow an up day today on a 500 point down day!
AOS is down 5.29% to 41.50
what a no brainer at these valuations
Tuff times but a solid company. I’m in.
"Great investment - real estate owners and plumbers need this because plumbers make lots of money daily as well. And AOS has eCommerce access, sound good to me."
A.O. Smith reached a 52 Week high at 53.69
I have money
one can only buy more to average down so many times....eventually it increases % of portfolio too much
Could be a solid buy pre-trade deal
Okay now it’s safe to add
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at $44.61
hardest thing in the world is to sit on cash when there are so many stocks you want to buy. but man it feels good when you have it ready for drops like this.
Nice report. Knew we would head down no matter what after the big run-up we had. Looking to add more on weakness and hoping for $40-42
"I hope that the 22% dividend increase has a positive effect. If not, I'm getting near my adding point."
"To be blunt, this company was a Golden Goose that turned into a Dog. any buyers here? Long-term holder, how about you? Some of you long termers may have got in at very low prices so maybe you're not worried? I got in in the high 50s so I got a decision to make. Happy Holidays!"
Up nicely now. Finally lol
A.O. Smith is up 5.14% to 54.10
This stock will pay off for any long term investor. It’s a well run company. You don’t take a loss if you dont sell.
Why was AOS dropped 6% Friday last week? the split? acquisition? too close to high end? cash in?
bought in a couple times this year.. thinking about adding again. very steady stock that will do well even if we go into a recession
This company is rock solid I know I use to work for them just hard working people making great decision for share holders the last couple of months makes no sense to me it just shows you how insane this market is no a days
AOS reached a new 52 Week Low at $43.13
"There was a 2 for 1 split last year in Oct when the PPS was $50. The split before that was 2 for 1 in May of 2013 when the PPS was abou $42 (split adjusted). I'm guessing that the next split will also be 2 for 1, but have no idea when it will occur. Assuming the PPS somehow continues to rise (despite that 30x!)"
A.O. Smith is down 9.13% to 37.70
HD doesn't sell AOS water heaters anymore as they have Rheem which I recently got installed in my home. How can AOS increase it's sales if it loses an important channel like HD? Do they have a good DTC online sales channel?
It’s hanging in there!

Added at $42.60 today!
I look like a genius having dumped my position last year @50. Jumped on ISRG that's been on a tear since
"Without a deal with China, AOS will continue to struggle. AOS was a powerhouse when they could count on their revenue from China."
"AOS has lost its reputation as a safe, conservative company to invest in. Short- term trend is down. Long term is impossible to predict, but AOS will have a difficult time returning to its glory days."
Can't sell American brands in China anymore? Was a very pricey stock.

china? like really? sales fell off a cliff compared to 2018!
add more shares....too cheap
"In my opinion, AOS is very close to being the proverbial ""great company at a good price"" that a famous Oracle once said is better to invest in than a ""good company at a great price"".The biggest negatives seem to be tarrif and trade war issues that could end soon with the snap of a Presidential decree of victory. Or, of course, get worse.I have no intention of selling at this time. I hope to add a little soon.Keep the faith."
someone has been accumulating shares. big volume past few days
Far fewer people posting on this board than the last time AOS was at $50. Bullish IMO.
Wow crashed today.
A.O. Smith is up 5.82% to 42.76
"Its all because of the President tariffs policy, this will hurt AOS they do a lot of business with China and Canada."

"They missed revenues. That's why its downThe maker of water heaters and boilers posted revenue of $812.5 million in the period, which fell short of Street forecasts. Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $825.9 million."
Is this drop because of the twit laughed at the UN in the white house or is there something else?
TODAY!! A. O. Smith announces double-digit 2016 earnings growth on six percent increase in sales..........Beats Wall Street's Expectations.........Stock price goes down 3%...........#$%$?
Ugh. This baby is going red after that forecast.
"A.O. Smith Short Seller Alleges Accounting Irregularities, Opaque Chinese Business; Stock Falls 10%"
This is going back to low 40’s
"Big demand for water heaters, tankless and hybrid ones. They are a key to limiting fossil fuels. Stock is a strong buy and dips should be bought."
Street has no confidence in Kevin Wheeler as CEO. Investor PR is a debacle. Short interest #s tell the story. Great company will stagnate long term until Board of Directors wakes up!
"This stock is getting absolutely slaughtered, and the selling should continue the rest of the year as investors who haven’t sold already, will sell for “Tax Loss” purposes."
Can anyone here quantify the size of the relationship with UTP?

"If the shorts are right about the fraud, you would expect lawyers to show up to ""protect shareholders""."
Okay Board time to split what are you waiting for?????
Big reversal on AOS this morning. News?
AOS. Great that I dumped my position at 50
"I've been watching this stock for a while, finally pulled the trigger @ 47.75. With a huge opportunity in India/China and almost 3 times as much cash as debt, I see extremely low long term risk at these levels."
"All, what gives going into earnings?"
A.O. Smith reached a 52 Week low at 38.18
keep going you boring old water heater company that's funding my retirement.
AOS reached a 52 Week low at 39.93
The company NEEDS to respond to these allegations. No comment is almost like an admission of guilt at this point.
"This is one of those companies (like Texas Instruments) that has no problem giving profits back to investors. It has a product, and it does good business, but more importantly it’s trying to transmit wealth to investors. Love it!"
The sp should get a nice bounce today
"The price movement since the recent excellent earnings report has been shaky, mostly to the downside. AOS is trading below the 50 day and 200 day moving averages. I think the ""Bears"" are in control now because of valuation (PE of 30), and the possible impacts of the Trade War with China. I think the company has a bright future, but right now I see more downside in terms of price per share."
Can someone explain why this is up 5% on top and bottom earnings miss???? Seemed like a not so good quarter

I addet to my AOS holdings today at $51.525.
Leach lawyers just making themselves rich and destroy companies.Whatever settlement you get will be crumbs after the lawyers get their fees and expenses.
Just pulled the trigger on a measly 200 shares - i have dry powder also picked up some WFC BAC and a few more share of TMight as well go out with a bang.
45.18 and falling - This is going to be a great buying opportunity some day.
But on the bright side we wee just paid a .22 cent dividend? Womp womp.

Hope this stock doesnt start sliding down again
"I'm a long and a big fan of AOS (as, I think, can be seen from my posts). However, I heard some negative anecdotal info about the old days and AOS' farm silos. In the somewhat lengthy video on the company's history, not much is said about them but there is one photo included. Does anyone know the story? Is AOS connected to Harvestore or any other silos at this time?I don't mean to bring up a possible negative topic (albeit possibly dated), but would be interested in any related facts. Thanks"
I am worried about the head and shoulder forming
insider buying?
Tariffs a concern? What percentage of the products AOS sells in China are * made * in China - and thus presumably immune to any new restrictions in response to tRump?

such an easy decision to buy at these levels. always nice to add to a core holding
It feels like a test of the lows will be coming!
AOS is up 4.91% to 37.63
about ready to double down on this stock. hoping it drops below $50
anyone think this stock moves WITHOUT positive China news ?
All of those houses built in 2005-2007 will need water heaters soon. Most came with AOS heaters

They misses by 6 cents. Wow that’s a bit of a disappointment.
Too many questions about activity in China for me
This still a good long term bet?
I am looking to but below $50. Will be waiting on the sidelines.
AOS is down -4.91% to 63.54
Retest of $42 again? But I'm tempted to buy more here just under $45.
Is there a way to mute Access Wire & Globe news wire. Get tired of them loading up the summary page.
"bought this at $31.85. this is a hold now, not a buy. watch the 400 day. that is the number you are investing in. wait until the 50 day is higher than it was 30 days earlier AND you are still under the 400 day. otherwise you are catching a falling knife. this is simply a correction for whatever reason. but not a buy-yet. wait."
Just a grinder.
PPS hits 52 week high. Dividend increase of 29%. Does anyone see anything wrong with this company other than the fact that the share price keeps going up?
Nice day today. Looks like we finally bottomed.

"#AOS Looking better to the upside after some consolidation. Bullish indication in MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 61.44 for a run up to 71.76."
What a great core holding AOS is even at these levels.
Why add now? This company although well managed is going lower
