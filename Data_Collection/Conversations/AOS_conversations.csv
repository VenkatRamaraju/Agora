"They missed revenues. That's why its downThe maker of water heaters and boilers posted revenue of $812.5 million in the period, which fell short of Street forecasts. Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $825.9 million."
"I added today at $65.41. I may regret this later, but AOS appears to be in a good space and doing ""everything"" right at this time.My main concerns are the price of steel, possible tarrifs, and a somewhat frothy price per share. Are there other things specific to AOS that we longs should be worrying about? Thanks."
Great earnings report this morning...impressive growth and very low debt. I see AOS at $75-80 this year and approaching $100 next year.
"I've been watching this stock for a while, finally pulled the trigger @ 47.75. With a huge opportunity in India/China and almost 3 times as much cash as debt, I see extremely low long term risk at these levels."
Nobody thinks about a water heater until hot water stops working.
"So weird. It goes down for weeks, and it finally pops on the day of a missed ER. Can any one explain this?"
60s been my buy price but I'm a little skeptical still if I should wait longer
PPS hits 52 week high. Dividend increase of 29%. Does anyone see anything wrong with this company other than the fact that the share price keeps going up?
Added at $42.60 today!
Just added to my current position.
Here's hoping tomorrow's earnings are good enough that we can move up. Its been a tough 2 months.
$BLGO Incase you missed it - it is the perfect introduction to Biolargo.A 25min speed date that might make you join the ESG 20X plus opportunityThe Recording from last weeks Investors Summit is online- Below is a link to watch it (free registration).When we will confirm our lab results that we do have the best low cost PFAS collecting technology- commercial units are about 60-90 days away- with scheduled trials at some of the worlds biggest water systems- this will multiply quickly.IMHO Biolargo is a clean tech monster in the making and it is just a matter of time when this will het discovered.Perfect introduction!Link is in replies- if it sticks And on Reddit and Stocktwits.#cleanwater #Green #PFAS #INVEST #OTC #AOS #AEC #Biolargo#Pennystocks #DD #ESG
"I hope that the 22% dividend increase has a positive effect. If not, I'm getting near my adding point."
I think I’ll add some shares on Monday. Price is starting to look right.
"To be blunt, this company was a Golden Goose that turned into a Dog. any buyers here? Long-term holder, how about you? Some of you long termers may have got in at very low prices so maybe you're not worried? I got in in the high 50s so I got a decision to make. Happy Holidays!"
Up nicely now. Finally lol
What a great core holding AOS is even at these levels.
I added today under $56. Great entry point for the long haul.
"I'm a long and a big fan of AOS (as, I think, can be seen from my posts). However, I heard some negative anecdotal info about the old days and AOS' farm silos. In the somewhat lengthy video on the company's history, not much is said about them but there is one photo included. Does anyone know the story? Is AOS connected to Harvestore or any other silos at this time?I don't mean to bring up a possible negative topic (albeit possibly dated), but would be interested in any related facts. Thanks"
what's a good entry point?
such an easy decision to buy at these levels. always nice to add to a core holding
"This is one of those companies (like Texas Instruments) that has no problem giving profits back to investors. It has a product, and it does good business, but more importantly it’s trying to transmit wealth to investors. Love it!"
This still a good long term bet?
Ayyy if it goes to 60 I'm at my buy price target
Up on bad news and lower guidance translates into “not as bad as some feared.” Solid company.
A. O. Smith is up 7.38% to 68.99
"The price movement since the recent excellent earnings report has been shaky, mostly to the downside. AOS is trading below the 50 day and 200 day moving averages. I think the ""Bears"" are in control now because of valuation (PE of 30), and the possible impacts of the Trade War with China. I think the company has a bright future, but right now I see more downside in terms of price per share."

"I've been watching it too, glad I didn't pull the trigger at 47.75 We might test low 40's"
AO Smith Is Maintained at Outperform by BMO Capital - $66 target set today.Very nice.
Can someone explain why this is up 5% on top and bottom earnings miss???? Seemed like a not so good quarter
what a no brainer at these valuations
"Great company, great earnings and down 4%. This might just be your entry point."
"Did I miss something, why has this stock fallen so far so fast? Earnings are not for another three weeks."
Retest of $42 again? But I'm tempted to buy more here just under $45.
Is there a way to mute Access Wire & Globe news wire. Get tired of them loading up the summary page.
I am looking to but below $50. Will be waiting on the sidelines.
I'm surprised that there is not much talk on this board about the 100 Mill increase in the share buyback that AOS announced last week.
bought in a couple times this year.. thinking about adding again. very steady stock that will do well even if we go into a recession
"""The second quarter proved to be challenging, largely due to difficult revenue growth comparisons and the overall macroeconomic environment in China,"" said Kevin Wheeler, president and chief executive officer. ""Performance in North America remained steady despite expected lower water heater volumes in the second quarter."""
