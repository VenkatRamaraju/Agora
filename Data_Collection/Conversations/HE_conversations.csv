"Ige...""denied"". Guess that envelope wasn't thick enough."
But yes Hei will go back to 40 and again to 54 but this is an investment stock; not for speculation or gambling...
"Increase in dividend going from $.31 to .32. Only a penny, but this is the first since since I’ve owned that we had an increase!!!"
"Stock repurchases from dividend reinvestment is due, also..."
what happened today up 13% on no news that i can see.
Why can’t this worthless CEO sell a cancer drug with 2 FDA approvals..! #he must go !!!
Happy holidays to the three stockholders who write on this MB
Now they can vote in a dividend cut to finish off the rest of He shareholders that still have hope for the State owned company
"Same old #$%$, the top brass get huge pay raises every year, the stockholders get the shaft. No increases since I owned this company. ZERO communication from company about effect of lava flow and hurricane damage, but make sure they get their bonuses again next year"
"Between the long lava and the damaging hurricane , was there damage to all the solar panels on the islands that may effect the profits to HE???"
Why down sooo much ??
"Connie Lau, a greedy grasping CEO and her ilk, on the board are doing great Don't hold your breath on dividend increase. I've owned shares since 1995 and don't remember the last dividend increase. The company is run by a very tight cabal that has grabbed off the cash by awarding themselvels shares each year. Take a look at insider transactions. None of the crooks in management have bought anything. It's all stock awards, gifts and sales. The positive news is the stock has more than quadrupled since split around 2004.. It is a good place to store money, as long as you didn't need to sell in 2007-10. Lau, the board and the Hawaiian PUS prevented the NEXTERA deal because the gravy train would end. Too bad the island is so corrupt with DEM pols. These grasping crooks would be in jail.Reply"
"American bank did not have a good quarter.!With interest rate going down, next quarter will not be good either imp"
HE is up 4.93% to 44.95
So why has this gone up? The ASB is heavily invested in commercial and residential real estate in Hawaii. So as people loose jobs over a drop in tourism there should be more mortgage non payments ... Meaning less cash for HE. So why isnt this staying down since its prospects are heavily linked to Hawaii economy which is reliant on tourism. Anyone care to explain?
"Monday, dividend day!!! More stock for our portfolio!!"
HE reached a 52 Week low at 37.80
HE reached an all time high at 43.02
So anyone have an update as to exactly what kind of threat Hawaii Solar Energy Tech will have to HE's stock for the foreseeable mid-to-long term?
"HE is a good, solid long-term portfolio dividend paying stick. That is a different category that takes a different analysis than , oh, i didn’t make a lot of money on it in the last 3 months. New investors lack perspective, jugdment and knowledge which comes from life experiences that significantly knock your portfolio down a few times..."
All my dividends are plowed back into the stock to accumulate more shares and more income long term. It is a safe bet that Hawaii will always need energg and banks...
"For Louis Navallier to score HEI so poorly plus mention some hyped activist wanna be investor who sent some letter around that shareholders did not receive is absurd. He is trying to liwer the stick price in my opinion as a ling term investor in HEI. Dividends are paid regularly, it is a long term investment not a trde, and the HEI board has invested in the future of a sustainable Hawaii. They know; Navallier doesn’t..."
Good dividend; Hawaiian utility with Hawaiian bank: Air conditioning and real estate. Almost a no brainer
Cool off time
)))HEXO Alert((( PLUG Rising!
AI computers have messed up the market. This stock should not move like a trading stock fir no good reason. Too many previously secure sticks are being manipulated and traded now. Absurd.
"Good sign, American Bank bringing in more profits as the Feds raise interest. Just maybe small dividend increase in the near future."
HE is down 4.97% to 50.67

"HEI built a new building in downtown Honolulu last year I think. They are consolidating offices, and working on a sustainable future for Hawaii’s energy."
"Simply Wall St. does not take covid 19 visitor drp to Hawaii nor bank profits. Trying to purposely create negative press without objective perspective. And 55 dollar high last year now removed as if didn’t occur...still get dividend payer, and dollar cost averaging stock for investment."
Hawaiian Electric is down 4.93% to 41.11
let's see 50....
"I know this is not a trading stock and have held some since the early 80's but with the return to tourism,and the news that Maui is actually trying to limit tourism because of overcrowding -seems to me that this is a very good time to actually buy a bigger share ,as I believe the stock price is headed much higher in the next 2 quarters ,perhaps even $55 per share,JMHO what do you think?"
"I'll buy this at 35 all day long. It's a great defensive player in a stock port. Hawaii is not the mainland, and that can be a good thing for HE."
"Closed over the $50 threshold for the first time, enjoy the weekend!"
HE reached a new All Time High at $39.11

HE is down 5.17% to 39.83
Let's get this thing back to $25 where it belongs.
"HEI is a terrific utility, coverting to and caring for sustainable energy as much as possible; eyed by Buffet as a target occasionally; will do well under new administration. Investment works to stay safe and double your money slowly but safely in a few years. "
when can we see the announcement from the utility commission ?
Wose selling? Crazy argus should go away...advice irrelevant yet people actually listen to it. Absurd.
Wonder if Buffet is after this agsin?
HE reached a 52 Week low at 39.35
Time to add another 500 shares !
Hawaiian Electric is down 5.17% to 39.83
Argus Research is absurd. Mo facts/evidence/logic.
HE reached an all time high at 42.50
HE is the ward of the state now - glad I sold all of mine. Public Service of NH went this way before being bought by NEE - Boston Edison too - both dead and buried face down.
Another all time close today
"This is probably my most random stock I own, I don't live in Hawaii, know nothing of Hawaii, but I stumbled upon it earlier last year and bought in. Its been my most consistent stock out of my portfolio. Lol"
Argus us not worth the time it takes to read their forecasts...
Another all time high today!!!
I wanna see HE go down to maybe $25 a share? =)
Another all time high today!
I bought in at 35 and just hold and accumulate. Have about 15 utilities and that’s been my pattern for 50 years. A lot of utilities got merged or bought out over the years

"This has been the best year since I bought this stock 17 years ago, first dividend increase and continued stock price increase this year!"
will stockholders get the break $ in a special divvie? We should.
Am tired of computer programs selling a safe secure stock. Computers do not have an appropriate perspective on dividends and long term investing.
HE is up 6.04% to 46.54
HE reached an all time high at 39.83
"A new buyer would have to Gov.'s OK before proceeding--no one is going to do that. So, what happens next????? The Governor's concerns should have been worked out with the buyer--he's a fool because he cannot ever win on the sale of HE no matter who the buyer is.."
Wow.... just wow! 
"Utility and bank. Great combo. Now adding wind power, increasing solar, solid dividend."
Some one is trying to lower Hawaiian Electric. Waste of good time. Find another target to try and make money off of. This is for investment; not trading.
HE is up 7.03% to 36.74
Closed at new all time high!!
Hawaiian Electric is down 4.90% to 32.77
Found out why pps dropped 1.5% today - Because they BEAT earnings forecast. Yep... makes sense to me.
Another all time high at close
Simply Wall Street again ran a put down piece. They do not take into account new capital outlay for new downtown honolulu headquarters nor HE’s steadfast commitment to solar and other sustainable energy nor their bank.
HE reached an all time high at 47.29
Is this the message board now?
Hawaiian Electric is up 5.22% to 34.90
Good dollar cost averaging stock for long term investment. Don’t trade.
When was the last time the stockholders received a dividend increase. I’ve owned this stock for about 15 years and don’t remember an increase. Think it’s about time for the shareholders to get some $$$$$!
"Sorry to be broken record, but another all time close. Looking at the history of this MB, I’m just about the only one to contribute"
Why the drop today?
"Now, why would anyone believe that Buffon the babble head could buy this either. That article about Buffet would be interested in buying HE was a pump and dump story. If the PUC wouldn't let the merger go through, why would anyone think that Buffon could step in to buy. Oh geez, some of these writers are real losers."
HE is down 4.91% to 46.89
HE reached an all time high at 51.09
"Hoping for another increase announcement this month, even only $.01 per quarter would be nice!"
"Great week for HE, all time high"
Hawaiian Electric reached a 52 Week low at 39.35
Interest rates are creeping up again. Time to bail on expensive utilities. 2.8% dividend yield is not worth it
"Benzinga gives a kind of probably do not invest, stoking fear advice, lacking long-term perspective and then say at bottom they are mot giving stock market advice. Not worthwhile opinions...."
Great mews from American Bank!!! Really a great quarter
