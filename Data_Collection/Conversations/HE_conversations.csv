"I'll buy this at 35 all day long. It's a great defensive player in a stock port. Hawaii is not the mainland, and that can be a good thing for HE."
HE just announced a dividend increase to $.34 per share!
"HE pop today, New tax law will benefit company, think its time pay more to stockholders. Have not received increase in years!!!"
"For Louis Navallier to score HEI so poorly plus mention some hyped activist wanna be investor who sent some letter around that shareholders did not receive is absurd. He is trying to liwer the stick price in my opinion as a ling term investor in HEI. Dividends are paid regularly, it is a long term investment not a trde, and the HEI board has invested in the future of a sustainable Hawaii. They know; Navallier doesn’t..."
"Stock repurchases from dividend reinvestment is due, also..."
So anyone have an update as to exactly what kind of threat Hawaii Solar Energy Tech will have to HE's stock for the foreseeable mid-to-long term?
"Hoping for another increase announcement this month, even only $.01 per quarter would be nice!"
Who’s buying? I know warren buffet at one time expressed interest in HEI
"Can anyone say $50 in the near future and a ""Split""?"
Another all time high yesterday!
"HEI is a terrific utility, coverting to and caring for sustainable energy as much as possible; eyed by Buffet as a target occasionally; will do well under new administration. Investment works to stay safe and double your money slowly but safely in a few years. "
"I know this is not a trading stock and have held some since the early 80's but with the return to tourism,and the news that Maui is actually trying to limit tourism because of overcrowding -seems to me that this is a very good time to actually buy a bigger share ,as I believe the stock price is headed much higher in the next 2 quarters ,perhaps even $55 per share,JMHO what do you think?"
"Simply Wall St. does not take covid 19 visitor drp to Hawaii nor bank profits. Trying to purposely create negative press without objective perspective. And 55 dollar high last year now removed as if didn’t occur...still get dividend payer, and dollar cost averaging stock for investment."
Why down sooo much ??
Why the drop today?
When was the last time the stockholders received a dividend increase. I’ve owned this stock for about 15 years and don’t remember an increase. Think it’s about time for the shareholders to get some $$$$$!
"Increase in dividend going from $.31 to .32. Only a penny, but this is the first since since I’ve owned that we had an increase!!!"
So why has this gone up? The ASB is heavily invested in commercial and residential real estate in Hawaii. So as people loose jobs over a drop in tourism there should be more mortgage non payments ... Meaning less cash for HE. So why isnt this staying down since its prospects are heavily linked to Hawaii economy which is reliant on tourism. Anyone care to explain?
I bought in at 35 and just hold and accumulate. Have about 15 utilities and that’s been my pattern for 50 years. A lot of utilities got merged or bought out over the years
Bought on the dip after waiting for a 38.2% retrace to complete.
New 52 week high!!!
"HE is a good, solid long-term portfolio dividend paying stick. That is a different category that takes a different analysis than , oh, i didn’t make a lot of money on it in the last 3 months. New investors lack perspective, jugdment and knowledge which comes from life experiences that significantly knock your portfolio down a few times..."
First dividend increase in at least 20 years that i know of. Hopefully it won't be as long next time.
Another all time high today!!!
In what bank account can one get 3.5 % interest in a secure consistent manner? This is an investment stock; not for speculation.
All my dividends are plowed back into the stock to accumulate more shares and more income long term. It is a safe bet that Hawaii will always need energg and banks...
"Good sign, American Bank bringing in more profits as the Feds raise interest. Just maybe small dividend increase in the near future."
Good dollar cost averaging stock for long term investment. Don’t trade.
"This is probably my most random stock I own, I don't live in Hawaii, know nothing of Hawaii, but I stumbled upon it earlier last year and bought in. Its been my most consistent stock out of my portfolio. Lol"
HOw about cost estimates for geothermal plant damage?
"Benzinga gives a kind of probably do not invest, stoking fear advice, lacking long-term perspective and then say at bottom they are mot giving stock market advice. Not worthwhile opinions...."
Simply Wall Street again ran a put down piece. They do not take into account new capital outlay for new downtown honolulu headquarters nor HE’s steadfast commitment to solar and other sustainable energy nor their bank.
Great mews from American Bank!!! Really a great quarter
"PR Newswire gives a truer picture of HEI perspective than do hit pieces by Wall st week, yahoo and others who really do not understand Hawaii not their dnergy productiin system snd forward-thinking..."
But yes Hei will go back to 40 and again to 54 but this is an investment stock; not for speculation or gambling...
Am tired of computer programs selling a safe secure stock. Computers do not have an appropriate perspective on dividends and long term investing.

"Let’s give the ceo another million $$ raise , sounds good to me, what other CEO would want to live in paradise and be forced to take more every year to stay"
let's see 50....
"WOW, glad I got out at $52"
